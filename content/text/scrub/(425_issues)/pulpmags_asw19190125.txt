scarcely lasted from one week to the next pleasures were few and far between and
he couldnt save a cent

   he was down-but he wouldnt stay there he saw other men promoted and he made up
his mind that what they could do he could do then he found the reason they were promoted

his mind that he would get that kind of training

it brought him just the information he was looking for he found he could get the training he needed

made foreman now he is superintendent with an income that means independence and all the

chapter i

 make it murder dan

bryce chanced to be in the central
station when the  wagon  rumbled
up and detective johnson and two
roundsmen brought in harvey bancroft

   for although jim had severed all official
connection with the police at the time he
and i established the firm of  glace and
bryce still he had never quite weaned
himself away from old associations

  as a result he formed the habit of drop-
ping into the station now and again for a
chat with his former cronies at such times
as we had no press of business on our hands

   i didnt object it kept us in touch with
the constituted forces of law and order and
such matters as they had under investiga-
tion and more than once it had resulted in
smoothing the way for some of our own
investigations as well

  he viewed bancrofts advent with some
surprise he knew him in a casual way as
one of the younger attorneys of the town
he was a well-set-up chap square-jawed
and grav-eyed under a mass of light
brown hair somewhat inclined to wave
now his facc was flushed as the roundsmen
lined him up before the sergeant and jim
edging in saw that his eyes were troubled
and his lips tightly compressed

 	a-s 	

   he gave his name and occupation in a
 voice which seemed a trifle thickened by
 emotion

   the sergeant wrote down his answers
 and turned to johnson

     charge he inquired

     leave that open johnson replied and
 caught sight of jim whom he had known
 for years and with whom he had worked
 more than once in the past  hello
 bryce he said

   bancroft threw up his head at the words
 and glanced about some of the cloud of
 trouble vanished momentarily from his
 eyes and gave way to sudden purpose
  mr bryce he requested quickly  will
 you please come here

   bryce looked at johnson and johnson
 nodded jim stepped to his side

     mr bryce bancroft went on  some-
 thing dreadful has just happened at the
 house of one of my clients and the boys
 here hav brought me in i wish you and
 your partner would take up my side of the
 case and show them im telling the truth
 when i say i didnt kill that fine old man
 his voice broke the least bit toward the
 end he came to a pause and went on
  and let me call your attention mr john-
 son to the fact that you cannot hold me
 for any great length of time on an open
 charge


all-story weekly

  johnson frowned  i didnt want to
write it up against your name mr ban-
croft he said slowly  but if you will have
it why he turned to address the sergeant
 make it murder dan

   wait a minute whos dead said
jim as the sergeant began to write

   chadbourne johnson returned

   holy smoke the thing rather took
bryce off his feet henry chadbourne was
a millionaire a retired banker a man re-
spected and admired by the city at large
he was a widower and had been for years
living in a large house which he had built
for the bride who had died so short a time
after her marriage that not even a child
had been left to cheer chadbournes de-
clining years and now he was dead and
bancroft was accused of his murder jim
turned his eyes from johnson to the young
attorney

  and bancroft again compressed his lips
and nodded his head

  the sergeant stuck his pen back in a
tumbler handle down having finished his
entry against the prisoners name

  johnson glanced at the roundsmen and
jerked his head to signify that bancroft
should in the parlance of the police be
 taken back  to a cell

   one moment the latter said  bryce
-are you and glace going to take this
case

   sure jim accepted making up his
mind  you go on back and ill get hold
of gordon and well have a little talk

  bancroft nodded and walked off with his
guards jim got hold of the telephone on
the sergeants desk called me at our office
and asked me to come down

  naturally i complied i found bryce
with johnson who was giving out such de-
tails as he wished to a group of reporters
i nodded to one or two of the latter whom
i knew and turned away to ask sergeant
dan harrington to pass us back to ban-
crofts cell

  that was easy harrington had known
me for years and he knew jim of course
he called an officer who took us to the jail
doors and turned us over to a warder who
in turn led us down the gloomy line of
cages to one on  murderers row

  and it was there in the steel cubicle i
met bancroft first the warder unlocked
the door and jim and i slipped through
after which bryce made me known to the
man we had come to see

  bancroft forced a smile  admired him
for it too i like to see a man take pun-
ishment that way and stay game  my
accommodations are rather limited gentle-
men he remarked but take a seat on
the couch he waved a hand toward the
narrow bunk against one wall of the cell
and as jim and  perched upon it seated
himself on a stool which completed the
furnishings of the place

  i like to get a good impression of a
client at the start so  watched him closely
i have found that first impressions are with
me at least apt to prove correct

  my strange friend semi-dual explains this
phenomenon on the hypothesis that at the
instant the personal aura touch one an-
other you may sense the reflex of the indi-
viduality on which your own impinges

  be that as it may i have found the first
instinctive valuation of a person stand me
in stead many a time now as i inspected
the young attorney i saw a man who was
keeping a grip on himself over a great emo-
tion but not as it seemed a man who was
afraid and his first remark indicated no
more than one who knew exactly what he
was facing and had determined rt go
through with the thing to the end

   im glad you came so promptly he
began at once  because as my representa-
tives i want you to get on the ground as
quickly as you can to that end im going
to tell you the story concisely to begin with
and after that you may ask any questions
that occur to your minds

  i nodded bancroft took a deep breath
and went on im going to give you only
what i deem essentials right now i have
been henry chadbournes attorney for
some time my employment in that ca-
pacity came about through my own em-
ployment of miss nadine norgall as a sten-
ographer in my office some eight months
since miss norgall was intimately ac-
quainted with mr chadbourne in fact she
had known him all her life she was the
child of his former partner in business-
stars or evil



   hold on interrupted bryce  this
young woman was john norgalls daugh-
ter

   yes bancroft nodded  did you
know him

   i knew of him said jim  go on
 then bancroft resumed  possibly
you know that when her father died some-
thing over a year ago nadine was left
without means or any immediate relations
norgalls whole private fortune went down
in the wreck of the bank of which he be-
came the head when chadbourne retired
and if you recall that you will see why
his daughter studied stenography and later
came into my employ

   easy bryce assented  let along
to the real facts

   they bear on those already men-
tioned bancroft said  henry chad-
bourne had no children of his own and he
was fond of his partners child i happen
to know that he went to her at the time of
norgalls death which followed not long
after the failure of his bank to which il
was actually due through worry and a
final collapse he offered her a home
but nadine was not of the dependent sort
--and she wouldnt accept charity even
from her fathers old friend having failed
to gain his end in that way chadbourne
formed another plan he decided to adopt
nadine and make her legally his heir

   you mean that literally bancroft 
inquired

  he gave me a glance  yes wait air
glace-youll see how it all fits into this
mess chadbourne had kept track of her
and knew she was working for me he
came to me and asked me to handle the
legal end of the affair we took it up with
nadine together and after a time and
after chadbourne had put it up to
her on the grounds of his own lonely life
and wish for her companionship and love
in his latter days she agreed

   that settled i drew a will naming her
as chadbournes sole heir or practically so
of course there were several minor bequests
to old servants and things like that but
the bulk of the estate went to his adopted
child

   how much bryce demanded tersely

   a little over a million mr bryce
bancroft returned

   jim whistled

   you say his adopted child i broke
in  did lie actually adopt miss norgall
before he died

   the matter was closed this morning
bancroft said

   this morning bryce took him up

 wait a moment-this wasnt any probate
day

   bancroft shook his head  youre right
mr bryce but-this was an ex parte mat-
ter chadbourne had no heirs whatever
nadine was of age and there was no one to
raise any objection to the proceeding from
first to last furthermore chadbourne
wanted the matter settled without delay
and-well-we took the matter up in open
court at ten oclock this morning at which 
time the final steps were taken in nadines
adoption

    and after that i urged

   after that we went over to the chad-
bourne house mr chadbourne wanted
nadine to do so and  had some business
of a personal nature to close with him my-
self

   what jim shot it out cutting short
what seemed a glossing over of the point
by the attorney

  bancroft frowned for the first time he
seemed to hesitate in his reply   suppose
i may as well answer that now as later he
said at last  i desired to pay mr chad-
bourne a promissory note which i gave him
some weeks ago

   weil- jim prompted as the attorney
once more paused  come clear boy-
lets start this thing straight

    youre right bancroft agreed  well

-	i got caught in a margin speculation a
few weeks ago chadbourne advanced me
six thousand dollars to cover a break in
the market provided  would quit speculat-
ing in the future i promised as soon as i
could get  from under  that i would there-
after confine my investments to proved
rather than problematic stocks and bonds
and would forever eschew margin-gambling
thats what he called it well i pulled
out the other day and this morning after
we left the court-house i stopped at my


all-story weekly

bank drew the money and took it with me
to lift the note

   and did you once bryce got on a
point he was pretty much like a bulldog
you couldnt shake him loose

   yes suddenly bancroft flushed
 but i havent got the note the police
took that off me before we left chad-
bournes house

   but he gave you the note after you got
there

   yes mr bryce i handed him the six
thousand in bills and he handed me the
note from a drawer in his desk

  bryce subsided and i took a hand  and
after that mr bancroft what

   then mr chadbourne asked me to
step out of the library and wait as he
wished to speak with nadine alone after
that i dont know i went out and found
a seat i meant to wait and take nadine
back to the office as soon as she was ready
i sat down in the entrance hall and waited
for what i suppose must have been as much
as ten minutes i know i looked at my
watch and it was a quarter past eleven i
had just put my-watch back in my pocket
when i heard what might have been a shot
though the sound was muffled by the walls
then i heard nadine scream and the li-
brary door burst open and she ran toward
me crying that chadbourne had killed him-
self before her eyes

   what jim fairly yelled while i con-
fess i couldnt blame him as i felt my own
brain balk at the suggested fact

  bancroft turned his glance from one of
us to the other i saw that he sensed the
unseemable sound of what he had said
 she screamed it as she ran toward me
he reaffirmed and i lost some moments
trying to calm her a trifle before we went
back to the room she was almost unnerved
with the horror of what had occurred
but at length she went with me and god
knows i found plenty to confirm her words

  chadbourne the man i had left in seem-
ingly good health and cheerful spirits not
over fifteen minutes before lay half-way
between his desk which stood in the middle
of the floor and a stationary hand basin
he had installed for his convenience-when
at work in the room he had fallen upon

his face and was quite dead when i turned
his body over but in doing so i exposed
a revolver beneath the corpse and there
was a bullet hole in the left breast of his
coat as nearly as i could judge directly
over his heart

   i examined the weapon myself its bar-
rel was freshly fouled and one shell had
been discharged after that i replaced
the gun and the body as nearly as i could
in the position in which i had found them
because i knew it was a coroners case and
then before  called the police i questioned
nadine

  for a moment he seemed to consider be-
fore he went on  gentlemen  know that
what  am going to say now will impress
you as unworthy of credence-and yet i
would stake my soul that nadine norgall
believes every word she said to be true i
know her  have known her for months
i - again he broke off and a slow flush
crept into his cheeks

   nodded and met his hesitation with a
smile he had spoken in the girls behalf
in a tone men seldom adopt unless urged
thereto by a deeper feeling than one would
expect between employer and employed
 put all the cards down bancroft i ad-
vised  there is nothing to shy at in a
sincere affection you were going to say
 i love her i think

  he laughed in a nervous fashion  its
better than that glace he said in a tone
for the moment almost cheerful  were
engaged

   congratulations on that much i ac-
cepted  now what did she say
fie frowned coming back to the matter
in hand  she told a story no jury in the
world would believe and the worst part of
the whole affair is that she was the only
soul present when he died

  i felt my heart swiftly contract and
bryce grunted at my side  but-see
here- he began

  bancroft cut him short  gentlemen
nadine isnt under arrest but-there are
two men stationed at her house and john-
son advised her not to try to leave the
place without permission oh -he threw
out his hands- it isnt my trouble alone
which has upset me like this she isnt
stars of evil



under arrest but she is a prisoner to all
intents and the thing was so sudden it
came like a bolt of lightning out of a clear

sky-

   steady i checked him  give us the
rest of the story then and let us get to
work

  he nodded all right i cant see that
it has any value but ill tell it for what its
worth after i left the room it seems
chadbourne took the will from a drawer in
his desk and showed it to her he even
read parts of it aloud she said he seemed
almost childishly elated at the events of
the morning and the fact that she was now
legally his heir he would read a clause of
the will and then look over the top of the
document at her as though seeking to mark
its effect upon her or else merely to study
her face

   and then suddenly his whole demeanor
changed nadine says his face seemed to
freeze into grimly set lines such as she had
never seen it wear without a word he
laid down the will dropped his hand to
the drawer from which he had taken the
paper and suddenly sprang to his feet
then while she watched without under-
standing his actions at all he ran from the
desk turning his back squarely upon her-
there was a deafening report which filled
the room and chadbourne stumbled and
fell where i found him after i came in
as soon as she realized what had happened
she ran out of the door as  have already
described and-thats all

  if it really were all i had to admit it
sounded fully as fishy as bancroft had de-
clared it was past all reason that a man
who had just accomplished the object of his
expressed desires adopted a charming
young woman to fill his childless life and
made her the heiress of his estate should
without warning spring up and shoot him-
self through the heart only one hypothesis
could explain that and that was that chad-
bourne had been insane which no one who
knew the man would consider for an in-
stant i looked at bryce and found him
frowning and then he spoke

   the girl was the only person with
him

   yes bancroft inclined his head

  l and you left her with him

    yes

   and sat in the front hall

    yes

   so nobody could have come in without
your seein if they did

   no one came in said bancroft in a
rather miserable tone  oh i know how
it sounds ive told you in advance that i
knew the story would baffle belief as a
lawyer i appreciate that mr bryce

   he just jumped up and turned his back
and shot himself

   that is a very concise summing up of
the matter bancroft sighed

   and he was cheerful when you left him
and went outside

   i never saw him in a more cheerful
humor

   and you was in the room yourself-
you left just those two together bryces
forehead wore a series of wrinkles as he
spoke

   yes mr bryce bancroft said  i
left them together mr chadbourne was
sitting at the desk i had just given him
the money and taken the note and placed it
in my pocket nadine says he did not
rise after i left until he leaped up and-
well-died as for herself she was sitting
in a chair some few feet on the other side
of the desk and did not leave that position
until after the shot when she sprang up and
ran out to me

  bryce turned and met my eye it was as
though he asked me what i thought and
right then i had nothing to say in the
face of what we had heard there was noth-
ing i could say without more consideration
only i nc longer wondered that the adopted
daughter of the dead millionaire should
have been told to remain in the house

    it wont wash said jim at last
bancroft made no response there could
be no possible doubt but that the man re-
alized to the fullest extent the unbelievable
elements in the story he had told his face
his whole bearing showed it as he lifted
weary eyes and met my glance and sud-
denly there leaped into my mind a sup-
position was the man before me in doubt
himself was he trying to believe the girls
story even against his own common sense


all-story weekly

was it possible that his presence here might
even be a proof of his endeavor to shield
her so far as he could i had known men
to do things like that-young men-men
in love with some woman

   bancroft  resumed  im going to
ask you to look at this thing as a lawyer
rather than a principal in the matter how-
ever it occurred so far as i can see your
story establishes a most excellent reason
for the arrest of miss xorgall rather than
yourself now-

   dont glace he broke out  that
little girl never did it she isnt that kind
i know her she was fond of chadbourne
 yet she was alone with him and there
was only one shot fired as you proved
yourself now three hands could have
fired it chadbournes which isnt plausi-
ble on the face of the thing or that of some
person unknown-

   hold on bancroft cut in  do you
suppose nadine wouldnt have seen any
third person and that if she had she would
have kept silent at such a time be rea-
sonable glace

   then -i said slowly- there remains
but one hand mr bancroft that could
have fired that shot

  glace suddenly he sprang up and
stood tensely erect  i wont allow you
or any other man to say that without pro-
testing even the thought god knows i
need your help but-if youre going to
take this tack ill-just thank you fur
coming and ask you-to leave

   sit down i returned  were here
to consult not quarrel your extreme sen-
sitiveness on the point shows that you rec-
ognize its force now one question more
in the view of all you have told us why
is it that you are under arrest

  he eyed me for fully half a minute be-
fore he replied  thats simple enough
i told you i paid chadbourne six thousand
dollars on a note i paid it in bills he
took them and laid them on his desk and
i left the room chadbourne died and after
i had listened to nadines story i called the
police when they came i told them the
whole thing just as i have told it to you
they sought to confirm it so far as they
could as a matter of course i was able

to produce the note and did so but-the
bills had disappeared

chapter ii

further explorations

 i v appeared for a moment
  jim gaped into bancrofts face be-
fore he caught a deep breatn
 you mean the stuff was gone
u absolutely bancroft declared

   but-maybe chadbourne put it away
after you left the room bryce suggested

   if he did it would have been in the
desk instead of on it where i saw it when
i went out remember xadine says he did
not leave his seat before he sprang up to
meet his death

  i looked bancroft full in the eye as he
ceased speaking

  he nodded at what he plainly read in
my glance  so you see mr glace there
rtis one other hand which might have fired
the shot after ail i think that is what de-
tective johnson believes

   johnson searched for the stuff i in-
quired

   yes it was gone and-well thats
all

  i noted a pause in the middle of his state-
ment but set it down to the mans mental
condition more than anything else and
rose  i think i remarked  that the
best thing we can do now is to get over
to that house and do a little search on your
behalf rather than against it bancroft
where do you bank

   at the fourth national he said rising
and once more forcing a smile  you can
prove i drew those bills if thats what you
mean remember i stopped to get them on
the way to chadbournes after we left the
probate court

   thanks  said and rapped for the
warder to let us out  ill do that by
phone and-  see that youre kept posted
as to what turns up by the way ban-
croft when were you born

  he met the question with a puzzled at-
tention i suppose to him it did sound
rather odd but i wanted the information
and waited until at length he gave it and
stars of evil



i wrote it down without any explanation
at the time

  the warder appeared bryce and i
shook hands with bancroft and left the
cell and once outside the hall in the cor-
ridor which led to the front of the station
 paused and looked at jim  well i
said

  jim puffed he drew a kerchief and
wiped his brow  it cant be done he
exploded rather than spoke distinctly
 maybe joy kills sometimes ive heard
it did but no guy like chadbourne is goin
to croak himself at a time like that and
even if he did either our man or his girl
musta copped th money nope gordon
th thing dont fit its th poorest story
ive heard in a whole lot of years

   yes i agreed it is to me thats
its strongest point

  jim gave me a glance and a slow grin of
understanding  somethin in that too
he admitted at length  well what do we
do next see here what made you ask
bancroft about his birthdav before we
left

  i smiled jim had a reason for asking
that question as  knew and i did not seek
to evade the answer  the first thing i
do is to get the use of a phone i an-
nounced  there is only one man in the
world so far as  know who can explain
the impossible jim and im going lo get
hold of that man while im about it go
on out and call the fourth national bank
and find out about those bills

  jim nodded and turned off without an-
other word  made my way to the  dog
house as we used to call a room set apart
for the accommodation of the newspaper
men on police assignment which as i
knew would probably be empty at that
time of day took up a telephone standard
and called a certain number not found in
the telephone-book but which none the less
would get me into connection with semi-
dual

  semi-dual i pictured the man as i
knew him while i held the receiver to my
ear tall he was brown-haired with a
strong face a high bridged nose and eyes
gray and deep-oh vastly deep holding
within their liquid depths something which

seemed to hint of a knowledge surpassing
that of every-day men

  and their hint was no more than the
truth dual was what long ago i had
called a  psychological physician a man
whom others might call a mystic yet in
reality no mystic at all since he proclaimed
the fact that there is nothing in nature mys-
tical after all that all is but the result of
natural law of natural cause and effect

  of those higher forces of nature he was
a student it was by means of the knowl-
edge gained in their study that he played
the physicians part to troubled human
souls and put straight the tangled strands
of many a life he believed and had made
me believe too in telepathy chirography
psychometry and astrology as well

  oh yes dual studied the stars and
drew from them wonderful knowledge of
mundane affairs yet he was no charlatan
and none knew better than he how little
credence man places to-day in the forces
which he used to bring about his results
therefore he first gained his knowledge in
his own way and ihen set about to prove
it in a more material fashion that others
might believe not his art-but the truth as
to whatever might have occurred

  to bryce and me dual was the god in
the machine he dwelt on the urania roof
there in the tower he had made himself a
sumptuous abode and on the roof itself he
had built him a garden of shrubs and potted
flowers roofed in winter by green glass be-
hind the circling parapet which hid it from
the street and there he lived apart from
the world of man and its distraction yet
surrounded by it ready to step forth at any
moment when the cause of right-of jus-
tice demanded that he interfere

  it was on his advice that i had formed
my partnership with bryce it was to be
near him that we took our quarters in the
urania on the seventh floor time and
again he had assisted directed guided jim
and me to the final ending of some prob-
lem of human wo a private telephone
linked our offices with the tower just as
this line i was asking for now gave him a
thread of connection with the world be-
yond his roof

  the man was an altruist in a practical


all-story weekly

sense he understood the depths of the
human soul and he worked not for re-
muneration-not for glory but for the sim-
ple satisfaction of seeing justice done
justice-eternal immutable justice - was
his creed to dual the assertion that
 whatsoever a man soweth that shalt he
also reap was no more than a statement
of truth such then was the man i called
my friend whose help i was asking now
in the chadbourne affair

  his voice deep soft almost bell-like
reached my listening ear i brought my
mouth close to the rubber circle before it
and began to speak

  not once did he interrupt long associa-
tion had taught me how to give to his ear
the essentials of a case at the end he
asked me the hour of chadbournes death
and bancrofts age i gave the information
i had meant to give it it was for that i
had asked bancroft concerning the latter
fact even as bryce had assumed when he
questioned me concerning my act for
jim was an ardent convert to semis meth-
ods though when first he met them he
had scoffed

  there was a moments silence then
 go to the chadbourne house interview
miss norgall learn all you may from
her own account and your most careful in-
spection and then my friend come to me

  that was all but i turned from the
phone with a lightened heart and went in
search of bryce semi-dual was enlisted
in the case justice no matter where its
blow was aimed would be done of that
i felt assured and being assured i found
myself ready and anxious to throw myself
into the task to which i was sent

  i found bryce talking to johnson in the
front office

   i been talkin to johnson about them
bills an hes goin up to th house him-
self jim began as i hastened to their
side

   and what did you learn about the
money at the bank i inquired

   well-he drew it all right said bryce

  johnson sneered  what of it he
had plenty of time to ditch it before we
got on the ground he declared

   sure jim agreed in a somewhat sar-

castic way  he could have done that so
as to be sure hed be arrested when you
frisked him and found the note hed
have mentioned the money sure if hed
cashed it after chadbourne died

  johnson grinned  yes he rejoined
 i think he would especially if as he says
chadbourne was shot while alone with the
girl theres a lot to this we havent dug
up yet bryce

   then said jim  suppose we go start
some digging now he turned to me
 did you get your party glace

  i nodded and jim took a long satisfied
breath  come on johnson he urged
 lets get on the job up there

   all right the detective agreed
 though i dont look for much weve
been over the room pretty well already
what i want to do is to question that girl
without bancroft around to interfere

  we caught a taxi outside it put us
down after a time in front of the chad-
bourne house on park drive in the fashion-
able residence district where the old man
had lived

  we had some conversation on the trip
out of course but it didnt amount to
much johnson seemed to think that
either the girl or bancroft or both were
mixed up in the death of the aged banker
and bryce and i were hardly well enough
informed to form any definite scheme of
the tragedy as yet

  we went up from the cab and in through
wide front doors passing one of johnsons
men on the way the detective led us
directly down a hall from which doors
opened right and left to one which he
opened and passed through

  plainly as jim and i followed i saw
that this was the place where the death
had occurred it was the workroom of a
man it was lined with cases of books and
some more modern filing cabinets now
standing with closed drawers in the
center of the room was a desk oblong
flat-topped and at the farther end of that
and set at right angles to it was a type-
writer desk-one of those folding-leaf af-
fairs now also closed quite evidently as
t judged at once chadbourne when sitting
in the angle between the machine and his
stars of evil



desk had merely to turn in his chair to
give an- such dictation as he might desire
at present a man was seated at the desk
making what seemed to have been a very
thorough inspection of the drawers he
glanced up as we came in and then ruse

wheres th girl johnson inquired

 up-stairs said the fellow who was
plainly another of the departments men

   get her down johnson directed and
threw himself into a chair

  the other reached to the end of the
desk and pressed a button by the time
jim and  had found seats for ourselves a
servitor came in

  he was an old man with graying hair
and an almost shuffling walk he entered
the door and stood waiting his face was
a nearly colorless mask in which burned
two dark eyes i noted that his hands
shook in a way of uncontrolled nerves as
johnson requested him to ask miss norgall
to come down

  but he turned and vanished without a
word and i gave my attention once more
to the room in a corner formed by the
wall next the hall and that of what was
plainly the partition between this room and
the one nearest the front of the house i
saw the hand basin bancroft had men-
tioned a door midway of the latter wall
seemed to lead into the room beyond and
leaning against the wall between the door
and the porcelain plumbing in the corner
was an ordinary folding screen which i
fancied was probably used to conceal the
basin at ordinary times for the rest there
were two windows in the side wall of the
house a fine rug on the floor several pic-
tures in plain frames and a mirror-faced
door in the other end whether to a closet
or a farther apartment i could not then
know

  the opening of the door from the hall
cut my inspection short i turned my gaze
from the room to the woman who came in
she was young bancroft had said she was
of age but she carried the atmosphere of
youth about her she was of medium
height well formed brown haired and as i
was to learn on a closer acquaintance blue-
eyed now as she paused just inside the
door she was pale and her eyes seemed

dark under her brows as she swept them
about the room and parted her lips

   simmons said i was wanted she be-

gan

  bryce and i rose johnson followed
suit  why yes miss he said  i
want to talk to you a bit wont you sit
clown

  i spoke as the girl went to a chair and
sank upon it  miss norgall i am mr
glace and this i gestured to jim  is my
partner mr bryce we represent mr
bancroft and at his request yourself in this
painful affair

   that dont matter johnson cut in
 all we want is to get at th truth of how
chadbourne died so all you got to do
miss is just tell us how everything hap-
pened now youve had a little time to think
it over and aint so excited as you was a
while ago

    t have already told you that mr
johnson miss norgall replied  i was
not excited then i was horrified shocked
grieved beyond words to express but i
told you exactly what i saw and all-
everything  know concerning-what oc-
curred she spoke in a cultured voice sur-
prisingly rich and full which yet quavered
now and then as though not entirely within
control

  and her answer apparently did not suit
johnson at all  well-tell it again then
he rejoined  maybe there was somethin
in it i didnt just get at first

  miss norgall complied she recounted
the scene of chadbournes death in all
essential details it was the story to which
we had listened in bancrofts cell john-
son was frowning at the end  you had
known chadbourne quite a long time he
said

   all my life the woman replied

    lie was your fathers friend

   my fathers and mine

  he hadnt nothin to do with wreckin
your dads bank

  mr chadbourne nadine norgall
widened her eyes  no he was like a
second father to me when my own father
died

i believed her sincerity rang in her
tone hut once more johnson seemed dis-


all-story weekly

pleased for a moment he appeared to
consider before he resumed  you was
adopted by him to-day

   yes miss norgall inclined her head
save in defense of chadbourne her answers
were short it came upon me she was like
one shaken by grief as much as anything
else

   why was chadbourne in such a tearing
rush to get it done to-day johnson again
inquired  your father died a year ago
andall at once chadbourne has to adopt
you in a hurry and cant even wait for a
vigular probate day what was the terri-
ble rush

  miss norgall looked him full in the eye
 i do not know she said

   but he did adopt you to-day

   yes the girls tone was tired

   so that if he died youd inherit at
once johnson spoke softly in whal he
tried to make a very casual way

  wait a moment miss norgall you dont
have to answer that unless you wish
i cut in

  my reward was a swift glance of resent-
ment from johnson  here glace dont
butt into this he growled

  miss norgall considered  thank you
mr glace she said at last  but i really
see no reason why i should not answer so
far as i know being his sole heir i would
inherit at once

   and youre really and truly engaged to
bancroft

  for the first time a delicate color stole
into the cheeks of the girl  what has
that to do with it she parried after a
time

   oh nuthin johnson returned  only
i happen to know he aint any too well off
an your father didnt leave you enough to
live on and then chadbourne makes you
his legal heir and draws a will leavir
you-

   stop  said the girl surely you must
nossess intelligence enough to comprehend
that as his adopted daughter i would not
be in any future need of support even a
detective of this city shouid be able to
understand that

  i heard bryce chuckle softly and johnson
flushed as he tried another tack  you

 dont need to worry miss about what we
 understand now after bancroft left that
 money there on the desk and went out you
 was sittin in a chair over here on this side
 of the desk right about where  am located
 now

    for a moment nadine closed her eyes
 i saw her clench her hands  tlease she
 said  dont lets go over it again ive
 explained it already twice

    but johnson persisted  you was sittin
 right about here

  oh-yes--in that same chair to be ex-
 act

  and chadbourne was at his desk

  yes

  an he took this will bancroft had
 drawed out of a drawer which drawer
 miss

  the top one next to the typewriter

 desk

  an he left the monev lyin on th

 desk

  yes

  an read th will to you

  parts of it

    anything else on the desk

  some letters his secretary had written
 and left for him to sign also on the end
 next the typewriter nadine replied

  and while he was readin th will to
 you he kept lookin over th top of th
 page now an then

  yes

  an then all at once he lays down the
 will an reaches into a drawer for his gun
 which drawer

    the same from which he took the will
  an jumps up an faces over there
 toward th corner with his back to you an
 shoots himself

    that-that was the way it appeared
 said the girl

  he laid the will down

  yes

  where did he lay it-

  why- miss norgall paused and
 seemed to be trying to decide the question
 in point- i- didnt notice  was sur-
 prised by the change in his manner and
 was watching his face

  you dont know just where he put it
 then
stars of evil



   xo sir i do not

   and he didnt say a word he didnt
say good-by or nuthin like that

   oh no no no  the girls tones rose
ive told you just how it happened 
dont know anything more suddenly her
whole demeanor became that of one whose
emotions are getting out of hand

  but if johnson noted he gave no sign
i fancied indeed that he was playing for
that very result it was in keeping with
such an ending to hold this interview in the
room where the death had occurred in a
way johnson was using a mild form of
third degree or so it appeared

   this will left most of his property to
you he went on

   so mr chadbourne informed me and
from what he read seemed to imply as
much

  johnson nodded  thats what bancroft
says too and he ought to know since he
drew the thing at chadbournes orders it
looks to me like th question is did it say
what bancroft says or not

   ive told you mr chadbourne told me
the same miss xorgall said

  i took a hand for the second time  see
here johnson just what is the good of all
this fuss about the will youre trying
to find out the cause and nature of the
mans death as i see it not how or where
he chanced to bequeath his estate

  and johnson grinned  and thats
where youre wrong for once glace he re-
joined  if i could get my hands on that
will i might know quite a lot more about
how henry chadbourne died

   if you could get your hands upon it
i repeated in some surprise

  he nodded his head  yes i told you
and jim there a while ago there was a lot
to dig up in this case bancroft and miss
xorgall say there was six thousand dollars
lyin on that desk when chadbourne died
and yet when we got here that currency
couldnt be found bancroft and miss
xorgall say chadbourne drew a will makin
her his chief heir an miss xorgall says he
was readin it to her and laid it down just
before he reached for his gun and yet
when we got here after bancroft turned in
th call there wasnt a sign of th thing

like the money bancroft says he paid for
that note in his pocket th will had disap-
peared

chapter iii

who knows

for a moment nobody said a word and
then it was xadine xorgall herself
who broke the pall of silence and it
was i whom she addressed  mr johnson
appears to be laboring under the belief that
the will did not contain what mr bancroft
and i have said he seems to be trying
to prove that we have misstated its con-
tents-that we waited until i was legally
adoped and then - then - then - ab-
ruptly she broke off and went on in a dif-
ferent tone which rose and shook and
threatened to break from blended horror
and scorn  oh-he has my pity for
having chosen his profession if it has so
far destroyed his faith in anything good or
true in his fellow man that he can enter-
tain such a suspicion as that

  johnson flushed slowly and his answer
at first was a scowl bryce cleared his
throat  well miss he began  you
see he-

  and johnson cut him short  youve
got nuthin more to say then miss

  xadine shook her head  xo ive said
more than i intended already i think
johnson rose he came to my side and
bent down  you talk to her he ad-
vised  im goin out and see if my man
found anything new before we come up

  i nodded and he left the room i turned
my eyes back to the girl she was sitting
with puckered brows and set lips watching
the mans exit  the will really is missing
miss xorgall i said

  she sighed and gave me her attention
 yes

  and then she asked a question in turn
 mr glace you said you and mr bryce
were to represent harvey and myself at his
request that would presuppose that you
have seen him how is he may i ask
plainly xadine xorgall had a head of
her own and could seize upon several facts
and work them into a deduction i answered


all-story weekly

her at once  aside from a natural worry
about you and this whole affair he is all
right

   thank you ts there anything i can
do to help you she accepted and sat with
hands clasped in her lap

   perhaps i replied i had been taking
mental notes while johnson had been con-
ducting his examination and i drew upon
them now  you said there were letters
on the desk to be signed when mr chad-
bourne was reading the will now-was
the typewriter desk open or closed at the
time

   why-open i remember that she
said in some surprise

   whats the notion bryce inquired

   merely to find out how nearly the
room has been left as it was at that time
i returned that screen miss norgall
is it usually standing against the wall or
so placed as to conceal the bow in the
corner

   it is generally set in front of the bowl
she said quickly  it was so placed until
the police arrived one of them knocked
it over and set it aside

   and that door with the mirror leads
where i pointed

   into a room at the rear of this it is
the dining-room mr glace

   and there was nothing to make you
think mr chadbourne was in any way not
himself before he died

  the girls lips quivered  no after
harvey went out he called me to him and
kissed me and callcd me his little girl and
we talked for a few moments before he
read the will

  i nodded  bancroft said he wanted to
speak to you alone mias norgall may i
ask you what you discussed

  unexpectedly she flushed but she did not
refuse my request  he asked me if i
didnt want to marry harvey at once she
replied  he-he wanted me to stay here
with him and let harvey get another
stenographer at the office he had already
broached the matter to harvey and
harvey-

   was willin i bet- bryce said

   yes miss norgall dropped her eyes
and her tone was very low

   and now i said  i am going to ask
a painful question just where did the
body lay before it was removed

  nadine rose walked to a point almost
midway between the basin in the corner
and the desk and paused  here

  i joined her and so did bryce i got
down and scanned the rug and rose again
after a time  miss norgall i resumed
 i dont suppose you know whether mr
chadbourne had any enemies or not or
any callers the day before he returned here
with you

  she shook her head  no-but-per-
haps i can and out about the last she
walked to the desk and pressed the same
button the department employee had used

  as beforesimmons appeared and she
questioned him herself

  he shook his head  no miss he de-
clared  not to-day there was a caller
yesterday afternoon some sort of busi-
ness  think his name was belmore

   belmore andy belmore said bryce
   i dont know sir

   heavy set dark complexioned fellow
   yes sir

 bryce looked at me and i at him i
think we both asked ourselves what sort of
business belmore shyster of all shyster
lawyers-last resort of crooks in time of
trouble-could have had with the dead
millionaire but this was no place to dis-
cuss the matter and i once more addressed
the girl  and there is nothing more you
can add to our information

  -	nothing of which i can think mr
glace she said looking full in my face

  t turned toward the door in the end wall
of the room  and where does that go
i asked

   into a drawing-room mr glace

   so that it could be entered from the
hall-the drawing-room  mean

   dont nadine cried swiftly while her
eyes went wide and her lips parted she
took a single step forward and laid a hand
on my arm  oh mr glace-harvey
didnt do it he didnt-he didnt he was
sitting in the hall when i ran out after
everything was over he-couldnt have
done it he wouldnt have done it there
was no reason
stars of evil



  i looked into her troubled face and it
was then i saw her eyes were blue-a deep
dark blue as they sought to question mine
 steady i said  keep your grip miss
nadine all im trying to do is to get the
lay of the land im not johnson and im
not trying to fasten any crime on either
bancroft or yourself rather im going
to leave nothing undone to show the police
and the world at large that neither of you
did it before i am done im going now
but ill likely see you again in the mean-
time keep cool and dont let any one scare
you or trick you into any unconsidered
statements as chadbournes heir you have
certain rights beyond which they dare not
go

   youre going now she faltered and
suddenly it struck me she was like a child
dreading to be left alone in this house of
horror with only old simmons and the
policeman on guard since her outburst in
bancrofts behalf her attitude of cold calm
had left her and she stood before me young
vital appealing warm just a troubled little
girl

   where are you going she said

  i smiled  wherever i go i want you to
feel it is in your interest miss norgall i
told her  will you do that

   yes she gave me her hand  you
are different from johnson i-oh i hale
him-but-you are a gentleman and  feel
i can trust your word i-i am just going
to think of you as working for harvey and
me until i see you again good-by

   good-by i said and turned to jim
together we left the room and found
johnson in the hall

   did she come across with anything at
all he greeted our approach

  i shook my head and he scowled

   shes a wise jane he declared  see
this door here it leads into a sorter parlor
and theres a door from that to the other
room a feller could have slipped in and
back of that screen chadbourne had setiin
in front of his wash bowl and popped th
old guy off dead easy while the girl kept
his attention centered on her

   an later stuck the gun under the body
you mean said bryce

   oh that of course johnson agreed

   what caliber was the thing i in-
quired

   thirty-two of an old model johnson
replied

   did your man find anything in his
search of the desk i next asked

  johnson grinned  maybe i dont
know i havent run it out yet but-here
you boys might as well work with us as
against us he thrust a hand into a
pocket and pulled out a written sheet

  bryce and i bent above it as johnson
straightened it out it was brief and to
the point

  henry chadbourne

    sir four years ago it was through you i
  was sent into a cell but for your interfer-
  ence i would to-day be a well-to-do man
  when you thrust yourself into my affairs i
  told i would kill you as soon as i was free
  well im free now but four years change
  a mans point of view and i find myself
  more in need of funds than your life there-
  fore t am asking you to purchase the latter
  by advancing me the amount of my four
  years salary which you can easily afford

  so its rather up to you if you are agree-
  able you can simply run the word yes
  and sign your name in the personal column
  of any daily paper inside the next week im
  not signing this because  feel sure you are
  fully aware of my name

  holy mackerel said jim where
did he dig up that

   in a drawer of chadbournes desk-the
same where he had the will according to the
girl johnson informed

  an its not very old judging by the
looks of the writin and the paper jim
went on  i wonder how old it is it
gave chadbourne a week to get action
well-say- he broke off and divided a
glance between johnson and me

  it was easy enough to complete his inter-
rupted sentence if the time had expired
say to-day and the writer of the note had
really meant his threat

    all very fine johnson growled  but
-you didnt notice either bancroft or the
girl pulling anything about anybody else
bein in that room did you they wouldnt
have overlooked a bet like that

   just the same i pointed out  this
proves chadbourne had an enemy i think
it might not be a bad notion to look over


all-story weekly

the files of the dallies for the past ten days
and see what we can find chadbourne
may have answered the note if he did
that would about take the value out of the
thing at the start

   ill have that run out yet to-night
johnson declared  an if he didnt answer
it it may mean somethin and it may not
rich folks like him arc always gcttin that
sort of stuff from mutts what think they
can make an easy touch

  there was some truth in his statement
of course and i did not argue the point
 but your man found no trace of the will
or the money i asked instead

   xo he didnt johnson snapped  and
he just about took the place to pieces too

   and there you are said bryce  the
beautiful thing about this whole works is
that it couldnt have happened but did
chadbourne shoots himself without reason
six thousand in bills disappear a will
vanishes from sight you folks take the
place to pieces and shove the furniture
around-

   oh can the chatter jim johnson cut
him short  the coroner went over the
place before we began of course

   wheres the body i cut in  at the
morgue or a private parlor

   its down at the stevenon peoples
place johnson replied   understand
doc sharp is going to do a pus mortem
this afternoon to make sure just how he
died

  he mentioned one of the city surgeons
and a rather routine performance in cases
such as this where nothing is really left to
chance until all other clues are exhausted
yet it struck me as almost needless here
everything pointed to the cause of the
millionaires death from a bullet there
seemed no good reason for any such thing
as doubt

  consequently t rather stared as i made
my next remark  what for

  and johnson grinned  well glace
were sort of curious to know just how
chadbourne died

  there was a twinkle in his eyes which
put me on my guard all at once it came
to me that the city man was withholding
something from my knowledge and some-

thing sufficiently important to justify an
autopsy on chadbournes body loo

   how he died  countered quickly
 say johnson is there any question about
that

    that is the question he replied
l and thats the way you propose to work
together is it i rejoined  now come
across or we split right here what is there
funny about this thing which youre hold-
ing out come on johnson-come clear
he sobered  all right he agreed
 xow see here if a man jumped and shot
himself like that girl says-with his own
gun-what would happen to his coat

    there would be a hole in it of course
i said quickly  and if the gun were held
close enough the cloth would most likely be
scorched

  johnson nodded  correct and the
gun would almost have to be held close
enough for a man to turn his wrist and
shoot himself in the heart wouldnt it
glace

    yes i assented  i should think it
would

  once more johnson grinned  well-as
it happens chadbournes coat had a hole
in it ail right but--it wasnt scorched
there wasnt even a smell of powder about
it or a grain of powder b its mesh

  i looked ai bryce mis face was a mask
of surprise then  looked at johnson
and while  looked  saw not only the man
but the entire horrible bearing of what he
said if true chadbourne had been shot
from a distance-and the gun had been
placed beneath him after he was dead
then-then-

  johnson was speaking again  so i
guess maybe you boys can see vhv im so
damned sure chadbourne was bumped off
by some other hand than his own and am
keepiir my grip on the only two who by
their own confession was with him at the
time

   but he was shot wasnt he stam-
mered jim  you know it and you know
somebody else did it then whats the
good of this here  post 

   simply this johnson said  doc
sharp has some sort of wise dope on th
effect of bullets strikin force what hes

i
stars of evil



after is to find the sort of slug hit the old
man and from that hell figure out just
about how far off the one who fired it stood
at the time and well know whether this
girl is lyin about somebody else bein in
that room or not

  i saw it all plainly enough and i couldnt
blame johnson really for the stand he was
taking in the matter surely if he were
right and there was no reason to doubt that
he was then there must be some flaw in
the statements of both bancroft and the
girl and more than that the weapon with
which chadbourne was alleged to have shot
himself must have been placed beneath his
dead body after it had fallen and if no
one had been in the house with chadbourne
save those two and the old servitor sim-
mons then what could the city detective du
save set a guard over the girl and take
bancroft to jail it was the reasonable
course it was the only course-the one
which in his place i must have taken my-
self

  and yet i couldnt believe it bancroft
hadnt acted to me like a man with a burden
of guilt and i couldnt bring myself to view
the girl whom i had just left in the room
where chadbourne had died as one who
had killed in cold blood she had stood
beside me i had looked down into her
widened eyes they had been dark with
trouble pleading but surely not clouded
with fear or any sense of guilt they had
met my own regard fully they hail not
narrowed nor sought to veil themselves in
the least then what i asked myself had
happened in that room down the hall

  johnson noted my pause  live- you
something to chew on eh he remarked
 glace ive a notion this is one time you
wise little guys are in bad

  his words were like a spark in powder to
jim he liked johnson as  knew yet
always when they had worked together
they had differed on many points  oh
i dont know he said now in a growl
 weve chewed a hole in moren one theory
youve advanced in the past im willin
to admit it looks a cinch for you right now-
all right but wait till the smoke clears off
things aint always the way they seem

  his words steadied me some way and

brought me back from the field of con-
jecture into which i had strayed suddenly
a- plainly as though spoken i seemed to
hear again the words i had heard over the
wire in the  dog house  at the station
 and then my friend come to me

  and suddenly i sensed that semi-dual
was calling me to him in that strange tele-
pathic way he used at times when he de-
sired mv presence and knew not where
i was and if dual was calling it was
because he was ready to enter the tangled
scheme of things surrounding the end of
chadbournes life i looked at johnson
 you staying here or going back i asked

  oh ill stick around for a while yet
i guess he told me and smiled  im
go in to chin that girl a bit about this note
we found

   all right i agreed and turned to
bryce  come jim lets get along

  he followed me out and down to the
street on the corner below the house we
caught a car jim sighed as we took a
seat  son he began  not countin my
defi to johnson as anything but sound i
aint so sure but we re in bad on this job
myself

    you think the girl killed him i said
    xo i dont he declared

  	then you think that bancroft fired the

shot

  he shook his head  i dont know what
i think he replied but if chadbournes
coat wasnt even powder-marked he never
killed himself

   well i said  since neither one of us
knows what to think the best thing is to
go to some one who may put us right i
guess he told me to come up when we
had been to the house

  jim nodded  i reckon he agreed and
said no more on the way down town

  a for myself impatience urged me more
and more with jim i entered the ltranias
doors and caught a car through to the
twentieth floor at the top i still led the
way tip the staircase to the roof and into
the garden warm under the westering sun

  and then as always when i went there
the place took hold upon me it was quiet
beautiful calm with its growing things the
scent of which struck like some subtle in-


all-story weekly

cense to my senses arci seemed to soothe
the harassment of my mind beyond me
the tower shone white in the afternoon
light the music of a tiny fountain struck
my ear a dove cooed somewhere in the
vines which covered the parapet wall a
tiny sun-dial stood beside the central path
to the tower door its circle was carved in
arabic symbols whose meaning i had been
told

   eternal justice-eternal light

  lie in the hand of god-from whom comes
     light

  light-it lay all about me pure softly
golden as i paused and drank in the scene
would the one who dwelt here who had
made this strange place for his abode be
able to let in a mental light on the dark
snarl of human tragedy with which bryce
and i and a girl and a man stood con-
fronted

  and suddenly i smiled why not i
had seen him do it before why should
i doubt him now and yet each time i
viewed the mans calm use of the higher
forces of light with a wonder which never
died i had wondered the first lime  had
seen it i had wondered ever since only
now with my wonder was blended faith
then why was i waiting here beside the
dial outside his door

  i turned and with jim still at my -heels
went toward the tower and semi-dual

chapter iv

  the sun the moon and the stars

he sat in that inner room of his i have
so often described beside his great
desk with the golden light of after-
noon pouring in through a window and
throwing his quiet features into striking re-
lief they were strong those features
they gave one a sense of latent power of
forces held in conserved control ready for
instant and purposeful use

  and the light too fell on his robes of
purple and white which he wore hy custom
when at home flashing the purple in vivid
refraction touching the white to an almost
amber glow

   before him on the desk was a veritable
 litter of paper sheets and sheets covered
 with circles with symbols with numbers-
 the things i knew he used in probing the
 mysteries of life-astrological calculations
 -the media through which he asked his
 questions of the cosmic forces and through
 which they replied odd yes odd of
 course to see a man seat himself and seek
 to learn the truth of death of murder of
 violence and crime by figures set down on
 sheets of virgin white but t had seen him
 do it before and find the answer which he
 sought and my heart leaped as he lifted
 his deep gray eyes and met my inquiring
 glance

   and then he spoke  my friends you
 have given into my hands one of the most
 complete and finished problems that has
 ever come to me in this case of a mil-
 lionaires death the horary figure alone ap-
 pears to contain all essential elements both
 of cause and effect to predicate the death
 beyond any question and to predicate as
 well-the end

   a funny little thrill ran through me at
 the words assuranrj had rung in my
 strange friends tones assurance of what
 he had said ie end could he mean-
 could he possibiy mean i ha l already while
 bryce and i were merely confused by con-
 flicting details ad objective appearance he
 had reached the actual end of the affair
 the thing passed belief and yet he had
 said  the end

   bryce took the words off duals lips as
 semi paused  th end he mouthed
  you mean th real end mr dual you
 mean you sot that far along already that
 you know how the thing will turn out
 well-ive knowed you for a long time
 hut i never knew you to pull it as strong
 as that he drew out a crumpled kerchief
 sank into a chair and began to mop his
 face  why-it aint much more than
 started yet an cordon an me aint found
 out nuthin much worth while

   dual smiled slightly as i let myself down
 in a chair at the end of the desk  that
 he replied  makes small difference to such
 a figure as i have erected since my con-
 versation over the wire with gordon this
 afternoon the figure as you surely know
stars of evil



 by now mr bryce may run far ahead of
 the actual events in those other events it
 foreshadows it is but a reasoning from
 known or given cause to preknown and cer-
 tain effect it is but after all a mathe-
 matical calculation the answer to which if
 correctly attained must past all doubt be
 right

  bryce sighed as always duals calm
announcements had shaken his nerves  i
aint no mathematician he said as semi
paused  but-ive seen you do it before
-so all right what have you found out

  semi shook his head  suppose we first
let gordon tell me what you have already
learned

  i knew well enough what he wanted
time and again before i had sat where i
sat now and talked to the keen intelligence
of this man which seized upon each fact
i named and seemed to mentally set it
aside classify it and put it away for future
reference

  i began my tale dual lay back in his
chair and closed his eyes thereby it
seemed that he shut out all external dis-
traction and focused upon the one sense of
hearing the entire perceptive powers of his
brain he did not move nor speak to in-
terrupt he lay relaxed and listened at
such times it had always seemed to me that
the physical being of the man went into
complete abeyance that for the space
through which ispoke he became in all
save his vital functions no more than a
centered mind

  concentration-the ability to shut out all
-everything else and give full attention to
one separate thought or thing no mao i
have ever known possessed the power to
the same degree as dual

  and knowing that i spoke to his wait-
ing brain i told it all the whole course of
the day our talk with bancroft our visit
to the chadbourne house our conversation
with johnson the finding of the threaten-
ing note the fact of the coming post
mortem and the object at which it was
aimed

  at the end he sat up and opened his
eyes and once more he smiled  appear-
ance- appearance he said we are
prone we mortals to go so much by that

   	a-s

 thrust a straight stick into a pool of water
 and the stick seems bent that is the
 refraction of light as any schoolboy knows
 to-day but-facts may be refracted even
 as light by the media through which they
 are seen and be bent from their true course
 and so be taken amiss and be thought other
 than they are and yet facts and light are
 both needful things in this life we lead and
 like the schoolboy we must learn to under-
 stand the reason back of any distortion of
 either which may occur

   jim sat up  i reckon you mean this
 here dont look like it is he broke out
  well i told johnson something like that
 to-day myself

    johnson said semi-dual  is viewing
 facts through the media of his understand-
 ing and experience mr bryce yet in the
 situation as narrated by glace one may find
 both facts and light

   i caught up his final words  you mean
 then that our work has been of value-that
 it fits in with your own calculations

    yes dual turned and lifted a sheet
 of paper from the desk i saw that it bore
 a circle cut into segments by intersecting
 lines and marked here and there by various
 symbols of astrological meaning such as i
 had seen him employ before

    in this figure he began  the major
 course at least of the whole affair concern-
 ing the chadbourne tragedy is shown as
 a matter of caution i shall go over it again
 and check it in every way i may to prevent
 against errors creeping in but at the same
 time this horary figure is singularly com-
 plete in it saturn and mercury appear in
 conjunction both stationary at present but
 one about to become retrograde and the
 other direct furthermore this conjunction
 occurs in partile to the longitude of the sun
 such a configuration when taken in con-
 -nection with the position of certain other
 of the planets would almost certainly show
 that two persons were jointly concerned in
 henry chadbournes death

    two  bryce almost groaned the single
 word his jaw sagged and his eyes widened
 with the sudden conception which seemed
 to have entered his brain

   nor could i blame him myself duals
 almost didactic statement had fitted so com-


all-story weekly

 pletely with the theory of the police that i
 myself was conscious of a strange pre-
 monitory thrill

   two said semi once more  saturn
is coldly planning mercury is a change-
able planet facile ready of wit but lighter
than the more positive planet with which it
shows in conjunction and hence dominated
by it during the conjunction but as both
are stationary now and about to become
either retrograde or direct both are more
or less weak and therefore dominated them-
selves by the sun in whose heart they are
the sun in this figure i feel safe in as-
suming may be used to represent the
powers of law either the law of man or that
higher and never-changing one not made
by human minds

  jim nodded his expression was one of
hopeless dejection  an bancroft is a
lawyer he complained  and you say
this saturn is a cold an calculatin guy
an mercury is a changeable person who-
ever mercury is an i guess that ought to
fit a woman all right

  dual gave him a glance  you make
your deductions quickly mr bryce he
said and once more referred to the paper in
his hand

   jupiter here is strong and swift in
motion in trine to the sun hence in trine
to saturn and mercury as well and at the
same time afflicted by their zodiacal parallel
venus next appears in conjunction with
jupiter and hence holds the same position
in regard to the sun and the other two
planets already mentioned but with her in-
fluence partaking of the nature of the
stronger planet with which she is placed
since venus too is a mutable planet taking
on the dominant force of the planet with
which she is conjoined

   venus said bryce and grinned  i
guess you was right a minute ago when you
said i made my deductions fast maybe i
made em too fast eh venus is a woman
i know that much and theres only one
skirt in this affair

semi-dual smiled as he replied  venus
is feminine in nature mr bryce but i can
hardly agree with your final statement that
only one woman is concerned in this case
 what - er - that is you mean theres

another mixed up in the thing bryce
stared

   i feel assured of that dual replied
 mars in this figure of mine is posited in
a feminine sign that would predicate a
second female agent in the matter i will
even go as far as to give you her personal
appearance if you like she will be dark-
haired a brunette with a small nose possi-
bly pointed and of a mercenary turn of
mind and as mars is in square to uranus
in square to saturn in square to mercury
and in square to the sun signifying among
other things cold-blooded calculation and
love for money keen wit used in a wrong-
ful cause or causes and friction with the
duly constituted authorities of the law we
may consider that she must enter into this
and that since mars is not a weak planet in
the figure her connection will be not direct
as an agent of chadbournes actual death
but rather that she will prove to be an ac-
cessory either before or after the fact
preferably the last

   hold on i dont get that at all jim
exclaimed  you mean some such dame is
mixed up in this of course but what do you
mean by an accessory after the fact
where does that come in

   an accessory after the fact comes in
after the primary factor mr bryce said
dual

   after chadbourne was dead then
said jim

   yes mr bryce - after chadbournes
death

   and -jim leaned forward as he spoke
- is there anything in that figure of yours
showin as chadbourne himself

   naturally semi smiled  uranus
stands i think for the dead millionaire
it is an eccentric planet ruler of sudden
and inexplicable deaths in this chart of
mine it is retrograde and in square to mars
and eclipsed by the moon at the time when
chadbourne died hence i feel sure we
may assume that it stands for the man him-
self and that its position and the manner
in which it is aspected indicates death by a
martial tool-a revolver in this case as we
know

   now in addition to all else on which
i have touched we have to consider the
stars of evil



moon and the aspects which it will form
from the moment of chadbournes death
until the culmination of the whole affair
the moon eclipsed uranus at the instant
chadbourne died it blotted chadbourne
out from that position it will pass to a
square with mars to an opposition with
saturn to an opposition with mercury of
course to an opposition with the sun and
from there to a sextile with jupiter and
venus where the case will come to an end
 you mean it will end when the moon
has gone from one to another of those posi-
tions and brings up at the last place youve
named jim inquired

   yes

   and you dope out all this you say just
from the way theseplanets are placed one
to another-th way one of them affects
another an because this uranus is blotted
out you figure him as chadbourne an you
pick out who did him up by the way theyre
hooked up with the planet you take for
him

   exactly dual inclined his head
 some positions are good and others are
bad and some may be one or the other de-
pending upon the nature of the planets
which go to make up the figure my friend
even certain planets may be good or bad
according to their position at the time the
moon and mercury are mutable partaking
of the nature of the other planets when
ruled by them and the same is true of
venus if certain conditions arise and the
sun if strong becomes a relentless task-
master-overriding all his voice rose
slightly at the last and rang with a strange
unwonted timbre  in this case he proves
so indeed and through him justice is done
 through the law

   aye said dual  through the law-
the law of eternal justice for he stands
in a good position to the symbols of good
and in evil aspect to the things which are
evil in this so shall the end be brought
about in gods good time since he it was
who set his fiery symbols in the sky

   gosh i hope so bryce averred  it
sounds all right when you say it but-
what do i and gordon do

  semi-dual turned his eyes to me they
were deep alive with a singular living light

yet his words came softly in reply  wait
-wait on the lady moon my friends while
she slips from spot to spot on the checker-
board of days and nights

   wait i said  semi-you mean ex-
actly that

   wait and learn what you may to sup-
port the message of the stars and that end-
ing they foretell when the proper time is
come for my friends as the tides are
swayed by the moon so are men and wo-
men swept irresistibly toward good or evil
by the stars which dominate their lives
then indeed i felt sure semi knew
despite anything which might transpire in
the days and nights to come before the
thing was ended he was assured of the end
but he knew mankind would not believe-
that even for bryce who had seen him do
this same thing before it was at times hard
to accept his statements in simple faith
hence tobrvce and me would fall the task
of producing those material facts which
alone mankind would accept  have you
any special course to suggest i inquired

   no dual said  in this you must
use your own instinctive leadings for the
present at least being assured that the
influences are such that barring the con-
scious outside interference of some one able
to read the preordained termination each
actor in this drama of life will move as the
stars direct should there arise a need i
shall not hesitate to suggest or direct and
so throw such conscious interference into
the scales of fate on the side of justice
bryce drew a long breath as semi paused
and once more plunged into the blind wall
before our eyes which was no wall to semi-
dual  but-see here im willin to do
what you say i know what you can do
i aint doubtin you understand and all
youve said fits in pretty well with what we
know as far as it goes the description
fits the norgall girl pretty close an that
mercenary business th love of money hits
on her havin been adopted an made chad-
bournes heir an th accessory after the
fact-might mean she was simply tryin to
cover up what bancroft did since you say
there was two of them in it an th one
mercury stands for didnt have as strong a
part as was played by this saturn guy


all-story weekly

    of course that may not be right either
you said venus was in it too an that she
might be evil provided conditions was
right but accordin to that both dames
mixed up in the deal are crooked an i cant
make out which is which now if you
know why dont you put me an gordon
wise so we can get a better notion of what
were doin before we start out

  that was one of the longest speeches i
had ever heard jim give voice to in my
life i judged from that the depths of his
disturbed emotions and i know that semi
did too since he at once replied

   your question is natural enough 
must admit i hope that my answer will
seem reasonable to you some moments
ago i declared that unless disturbed by out-
side and intelligent interference the course
of this case would move step by step to a
predetermined end intelligent interference
would of necessity be based on definite
knowledge of what that end might be

   for fate is fate insomuch only as
ignorance prevails to him who knows the
things to come to him who knowingly faces
his fate as portended yet resists there is no
longer fate a man may  grapple with his
evil star as browning says and cast its
threat aside provided that he knows the
power enwrapped in every soul to such an
end

   and since this fact is true i deem it
best although i know the end the stars fore-
tell to hold my tongue that conscious in-
terference i have named must come not
from the side of evil but if at all from
those who stand for right and that which
has been given to me-that foreknowledge
granted me in this not for myself but for
others to safeguard them-i shall keep for
the present to myself unless some need for
its use shall arise my friend do you
understand

  jim nodded i reckon he said may-
be i might get too cock-sure if i knew and
spill something to johnson or somebody
else an a leak would be enough to tip
over the beans so its just  watchful wait-
in  for gordon an me right now

   workful waiting i think said dual
with a smile

   anyway tell me this if you can jim

went on  was there anything in that
figure of yours that hinted at that will
dropping out of sight

   i was positive something of such a
nature would arise semi said  i was
not sure what until gordon gave his report
but-the cusp of the house of money-
the second house-is afflicted by mercury
first and by saturn next and the cusp of
the house which governs such things as
secret documents and wills is ruled by nep-
tune a secretive planet-a portent of hid-
ings of hidden things in secret places
hence gordons statement did not take me
by surprise

   no said jim  i reckon not i
reckon it would take a mighty sudden jolt
to give you a surprise but i can see your
way of dopin it out a little bit at least
mercury affects the house of money first
an-well we know about how correct that
is i guess she was to get all chadbourne
had then saturn gets in his work-an th
will fails to show up them two hid it i
guess thats what johnson thinks too
well i guess all we can do is get busy and
sort of help the moon deliver her punch
 exactly dual agreed  work and
work with a full assurance that in the ful-
ness of time the guilty will meet their just
deserts from the law-not perhaps the law
of man mr bryce but above that-the
law of god they will reach it through
the relentless power of the sun and their
mutual connection with this crime they
will reach it through each other  think

 through each other  broke in
dual inclined his head  planets so
posited to each other and within the heart
of the sun must destroy each other my
friend

   must  queried again with a strange
and sudden fulness in my throat

  must dual laid his paper on the
desk to me who knew him so well the
action was as final as the word

   sure jim nodded his head  after
about so long somebody is going to blow
up an crab the others game but see
here mr dual what about that note john-
sons man found this afternoon

   that is something i think will bear in-
vestigation semi declared  the result

and thrust her into a life-boat just as it
slipped from the davits

  the knowledge that jones who was
ruinously high in his fees would charge him
nothing coupled with his aversion to meet-
ing women alone had prevented holt from
seeking his advice he recalled his errand
and spoke

   i came to book you for a ride in sea-
mans quadriplane he explained  you
remember him-a soph in our time shark
on mathematics lie has perfected a sort
of superseaplane great chance for us
jones shook his head smilingly

   no use old-timer you know me a
rathskeller with a small and select party
-no women-and ill put this cerebrum
on ice and go i respect aviation in all its
forms but dont care a hoot about seeing or
doing it

  holt grunted

   what you doing with that odious mess
anyhow he pointed at the specimen on
the table

   that oh  forgot to introduce you
pardon the oversight meet the late lucius
treat who suffered from locomotor ataxia
paresis paranoia and a few other minor
afflictions and died leaving four promising
young cretins to vote for president by and
by im putting a section of his brain in
my projector to see if i can identify any
cellular lesions

   youre higher up in the clouds than
seaman will ever get why dont you do
something practical who cares a hang
whether treat has any lesions or not
whatever he had you couldnt cure him
of and hes dead why dont you accom-
plish something we can make use of-

   as what for instance

   well - er - you spend all your time
monkeying with the human intellect and its
repulsive envelope why not teach us how
to be prophets

   oh i dont know just what is a
prophet anyhow whatever he is he isnt
a long-whiskered seer peering into the vapor
of some witches caldron did you ever
stop to consider that in every great war of
the past two thousand years some one has
pointed out that the prophet daniel foretold
it in the old testament it is so to-day

also that in each event of world-wide
import there have been uttered predictions
covering every possible outcome and that
some one of these must of course guess
right thereupon we get that  i told you
so  stuff it now appears that this present
debacle was foretold over and over again
 theres something in that of course
but youre talking of jalse prophets im
speaking of the genuine article if he exists
 very good when you read a properly
constructed mystery story you find in the
last chapter a climax the necessary elements
of whose solution were all present in the
preceding pages it you had possessed the
type of mind capable of reading them
aright most editors and many observant
readers do forecast the conclusion well
life is a mystery plot all the clues are
present-nothing is wanted but a mind
capable of winnowing the chaff out and
matching up the essential fragments in
other words a prophet needs but two
things sufficient data and the logical
a priori and a posteriori intellect to utilize
it

   ve-ry simple learned healer proving
either that no such mind exists in mortal
born of woman or that the data is lacking
 proving nothing of the sort my egg-
headed legal friend such minds exist and
the data is all garnered all that is needed
is to make it available

   then why-

  dr jones silenced holt with a bony fore-
finger stained with something unpleasant
and reeking of germicide

   holt i could manufacture a prophet as
easily as i can make a new nose by the
gentle rhinoplastic art but who wants
to be a prophet

   i for one ever since i was a kid ive
dreamed of clairvoyance fortune-telling the
gift of prophecy

   youve dreamed of bunk i should
create not a supernatural attribute but a
perfectly normal and material function i
should simply make available to your excel-
lent brain the store of facts it already
possesses but cannot get at

   talk down to me doc if ive got the
dope lead me to it how do i get to bring
my powerful intellect to bear on it all

   jones seated himself opposite his visitor
brushing aside a clutter of empty vials
stubs of pencil fragmentary notes on old
envelope backs a piece of skull with a silver
plate set in it and other odds and ends to
make room for his elbows

    do you know that men are quite likely
to die of the disease they repeatedly dream
theyve contracted he asked

    nope never followed the dream-book
and mother shipton

    well it is a fact to such an extent
that we of to-day make these recurrent
dreams a part of our diagnosis reason
why there are a lot of little telltale symp-
toms too obscure to impress the conscious-
ness perhaps even to be noted by the
family physician but the subconsciousness
takes note of them all as of everything else
and in your sleep they are cast up on the
cerebral shore we have hundreds of such
dreams few of which we recall only the
vivid ones are remembered every per-
sistent dream is worthy of our attention
freud assures us and his dictum is generally
accepted by the profession

    but this is a long long way from the
gift of prophecy

   no it isnt consider that your sub-
liminal mind is a vast storehouse where
every impression however trivial is regis-
tered and filed away this includes the
myriad of seemingly irrelevant facts that
we are not aware of noting at all every bit
of color each pebble in our paths the
faintest sound the most elusive odor a frag-
ment of a dozen conversations overheard
simultaneously during the intermission at a
play the meaningless sequence of numbers
shouted by a quarterback at a football game
you saw twenty years ago as well as
the license-number of every automobile you
ever carelessly glanced at the shape of the
buttons on the coat of your great-uncle
the taste of a fruit eaten when you visited
india as a child-all this lumber besides
what you regard as important facts you
never forget anything you only think you
do if now your brain had access to this
stupendous mass of information covering
every printed word you ever read every
spoken syllable you ever heard why youd
be a sort of little god wouldnt you

    id be the original little tin god of
manhattan 

   and inasmuch as there is no such
thing as an isolated fact each item being a
link in a chain with its own past and
future and its interrelation to other facts
the logical mind could from its accumu-
lated data predict the future exactly as a
professional reader can forecast the end of
a novel thus to make you into a very
fair prophet i would have merely to put
you in touch with your own private collec-
tion of facts

   simple as that eh mere matter of
introduction mr holt meet your own
subconsciousness greetings subcon old
top delighted im sure

   jones grunted

    im not irreligious as you know i sup-
pose im more or less non-religious but
every scientific explorer comes at times to a
sort of psychic wall he recognizes as bearing
the sign  no trespassing in his rambles
he finds a tree of knowledge of whose fruit
he knows he should not eat fact holt
ive passed up a number myself dont
pretend to know why but there are a few
things too big for finite man to attempt
they belong to whomever you worship
carry too high a voltage for our brains at
their present stage of development burn
out our fuses so to speak get the idea
oh yes as a theory but id sure
admire to meet up with that subconscious-
ness of mine

   thats managed easily enough its a
shy bird-comes out at night in your sleep
or in delirium or the hypnotic state but
its playing with dynamite

   you mean to tell me it is positively
dangerous to be hypnotized

   not in the least it does not even place
one in the power of the hypnotizer as
popular superstition has it of course if
one repeatedly submits to suggestion from
another he does come in time to yield more
readily but i could not hypnotize you
against your will even if i had several times
done so at your request its not the danger
of that but of the possible ascendancy of
that subconsciousness a sort of sleeping
giant an animal without soul or sentiment
which is normally subordinate to the mind
forbidden fruit



but abnormally its tyrant as in the well
authenticated instances of multiple per-
sonality good servant poor master you
know

    well i have a pretty good will a
 copper-riveted digestion and no nerves
 worth mentioning  dont believe what
 you say anyhow but im game enough to
 take a chance if you can open up that
 mental library of mine so i can prowl about
 in it and look into a few volumes just
 enough you understand to do a few cute
 little parlor tricks of prophesying-

   for a long time dr jones stared in si-
 lence at the faintly cynical face of holt
 so long in fact that the latter stirred
 uneasily half suspecting that the physician
 was trying to hypnotize him at length
 jones shook himself and spoke

    by george youve no sort of business
 to tempt me like this if you knew how-
 many times ive wanted to try something
 of the sort and was too decent to do it-
 afraid to if you want to know if your
 family history were not so sound if i didnt
 know what a bone-headed sturdy common
 sense old chap you are id throw you
 through my window sash and all at the
 risk of ruining my crocuses planted just
 below as it is-no im damned if i do

   quitter jeered holt ive called
 your bluff

   jones laughed nervously his voice actu-
 ally trembled as he replied you win
 ill do it and well see what happens

   he rose and crossed the room to a rickety
 cupboard in which he fumbled until he
 found what he was after a little upright
 rod with a sort of a two-bladed propeller
 balanced on the top made of highly polished
 mirrors this he set down upon the table
 once more darkened the room and then in-
 means of a paper funnel focused the light
 of a single incandescent upon the mirrors

    hypnotism as you probably know is
 produced most readily by eye-strain if
 you fix your gaze upon this bright object
 and relax physically and mentally you will
 yield as soon as your retina is fatigued i
 can produce auto-hypnosis at any time
 often do it when fin alone here and havent
 time for a real sleep dont think of any-
 thing in particular or worse yet make a

 conscious effort not to think if i dont
 make the experiment now ill repent and
 youll lose your chance to be the only real
 prophet in captivity now look steadily
 he turned a switch in the standard of
 the rod and the little mirrors began to
 revolve swiftly and noiselessly

    didnt work hey laughed holt as
dr jones opened the wooden shutters a
second time to the light of day

     i didnt notice any hitch said jones
coolly  you were  out  about three
minutes

    huh well i dont feel like a prophet
complained holt rubbing his eyes which
felt a little as they always did after follow-
ing a five-reel photoplay

    much you know how a prophet feels
did you expect to begin to bawl forth dire
warnings before you leave the room

    do you really believe youve changed a
fairly good solicitor into a bum prophet just
by making him stare at a silly toy in the
dark for a few moments

    ive done this my old college chum
ive roused your subconsciousness and sug-
gested that for one week your brain shall
have free access to its storehouse one
week mind you no longer and if you
are not glad when the seven days are past
i m a chiropodist i count on your mental
fiber to stand the strain for that period

    you flatter me meanwhile as i pro-
pose to take in that photoplay prophet or
no ill toddle along thanking you for an
interesting half-hour el cetera-

   -	you dont happen to feel any premoni-
tions as to the weather for to-morrow do
you asked jones as he opened the door
for him  the reports say  continued fair
and warmer but ive a particular reason
for wishing to know definitely 

    not a premonish doc holt laughed
back over his shoulder  if im a prophet
im only a stuffed one

   the screen-thriller put entirely out of
holts mind the curious interview with his
scientific friend once or twice that eve-
ning it occurred to him but merely as a
transient thought he even forgot to men-
tion it in the family circle as he had
intended while preparing for bed he had


all-story weekly

a moment of seriousness recalling that to
dr jones anything relative to science was
almost sacred and that a pseudo-scientific
hoax was utterly foreign to his nature un-
questionably he believed what he had said

  holt switched off the lights and that
night if he dreamed at all he could not
recall having done so when he awakened
next morning xor had he thought of the
matter at all when he took his place at the
head of the breakfast-table

  it was out of a clear sky that the first
demonstration of his new power came to
him there had been the usual desultory
morning table-talk references to items in
the daily paper weather banalities grum-
blings because the toast was scorched the
give and take of a meal en jamille when
in the midst of a reply to some idle query
of his wife when his eyes were resting by
chance upon the serene face of his mother
there unrolled before him as a scroll the
coming three years of her life

   as if he were witnessing a motion-picture
he beheld her seized with convulsions while
she was knitting in her sunny chamber
saw the confusion of many distracted mem-
bers of the family running to and fro the
arrival of the doctor and the administration
of digitalis she was tenderly put to bed
the nurse came there followed weeks of
anguish and a slow breaking down of her
strength and courage until the end came
every step he followed until they had laid
her away at rest

  it seemed to him that at least fifteen
minutes must have been consumed by the
grievous portrayal and yet presently he
heard himself mechanically finishing his
reply to his wife beheld the very morsel
of omelet balanced upon his fork inter-
rupted in its brief journey by his remark
and realized by a glance at the unsuspecting
faces about the table and at the dining-
room clock that time had been annihilated
for him all that he had seen had passed
in a measureless flash

   finishing breakfast as calmly as he could
he hastened from the house the sinister
feature of the strange experience he had
undergone was this he knew that it was
truly prophetic he realized now hat while
a false prophet might be deceived as well

as deceiving a true one could never mis-
take his message he could not tell how
he knew-but it was so

   nevertheless he proceeded directly to the
office of a heart specialist well known to
him socially and requested him to accom-
pany him back home distant but a few
blocks he told him merely that he had
reason to suspect that his mother was suffer-
ing from an organic heart trouble explained
that her health had always seemed of the
best and that she must not know the real
purpose of the visit occasionally she had
complained of flatulence her color too
seemed too brilliant for one of her years
it was arranged that dr young should be
introduced as a stomach specialist and that
holt had chanced to meet him on the
corner and invited him in something had
been said about a little medicine on one
occasion when her food distressed her

   it all passed off as naturally as holt had
hoped it might there was some good-
natured bantering his mother scolded him
for fetching in a strange young man without
giving her time to put on her new silk
house-gown the examination was made with
much thoroughness and holt departed with
dr young after the latter had written out
a prescription for-digitalis

  his diagnosis confirmed holts vision in
every respect his mother suffered from an
incurable form of heart disease angira
pectoris and was doomed to be a great
sufferer

  as he stood by the entrance to youngs
home it suddenly grew dark overhead
looking up they noted that black thunder-
clouds had swept across the sun the
morning had been superb fair weather had
been indicated in the reports for the day
yet now big drops began to dot the side-
walk and distant thunder muttered holt
found to his surprise that he clutched an
umbrella he had taken from his rack
without knowing that he dicl so or why he
should he went direct to his office now
arriving in a smart downpour

  during the rest of the day nothing out
of the ordinary occurred it chanced to
be a quiet week with him he had just
won a verdict in an important case and for
the present had nothing in hand but routine
forbidden fruit



work the reading of his mail conferences
with his associates a directors meeting an
office client or so he had plenty of time
to think too much time in fact a knotty
brief would have been a godsend that
night his sleep was uneasy his dreams mon-
strous but disconnected there was nothing
in them to which he could attach the re-
motest significance

  the thought of his mother preyed upon
him in kissing her good-by as he left
the office her womanly intuition sensed an
added solicitude which he believed he had
concealed

   what is it tommy she asked hold-
ing him at arms length and scanning him
from her faded blue eyes  is anything
wrong youre not overworking dear

   fit as a fiddle munisey he replied
forcing a laugh and tore himself bruskly
from her

   it came to him his next vision as he was
boarding a trolley-car he beheld as
plainly as if he were holding the paper
before him an account of the sensational
thirty-point jump of western copper half
a column there was all told with references
to an inside ring which had kept the good
thing strictly to itself and cut a mammoth
melon

  yet when he had finished he was still
setting one foot on the car-platform which
was not yet in motion he could not esti-
mate the minute fraction of time during
which he had seen the future of western
copper unfolded

   holt did not dabble in stocks at all but
like thousands of others he read the market
reports as a matter of habit much as he
read the baseball columns without attending
the games now without the least uncer-
tainty he rode on past his office to a broker-
age concern he knew by reputation and
after telephoning his bank for his balance
figures drew a check for practically the
entire amount of his deposit and purchased
a thousand shares outright had he been
a dealer he would have bought on margin
and pyramided as it was he felt contented
with a modest thirty thousand dollars
profit

   returning to his office afoot he happened
to glance up the towering white facade of

the new obelisk building the latest sky-
scraper instantly and in one of the
mental dashes to which he was already be-
coming accustomed he beheld a bulletin
announcing its destruction by fire under
date of the forthcoming night at twelve

  holt did not know the owner nor his
representatives save by reputation he
knew nothing of the building itself save that
it was the last word in  slow burning 
construction-as the insurance people say
-and that it housed enough concerns with
their battalions of clerks to populate a
western metropolis he seemed to recall
that a number of quasi-governmental agen-
cies made it their headquarters and it was
possibly used by certain foreign interests
since the recollection of bewhiskered and
crop-headed and ornately mustached gentle-
men in frock coats and toppers hurrying
in and out of its broad portals came to him
as he paused momentarily following the
vision of the prophetic bulletin

   it seemed to holt distasteful as it was to
do so with no evidence whatever his
bounden duty to whisper a word of warning
in the ear of whomever had the buildings
welfare in custody but what on earth
should be say how introduce himself
uncertainly he crossed over and entered
asking the starter for the agents floor and
being ushered into a great bronze lift

  the pursy gentleman who received him at
once upon glancing at his card looked
much like a walrus only warmer his triple
chins formed a series of rings above a low
discouraged collar and his eyes expressed
perpetual astonishment

   thinking of taking over one of our new
suites mr holt he barked his bristly
mustache erecting and beating time to his
syllables  glad to have your concern
with us-

    its not business mr fletcher holt
nervously began seating himself and speak-
ing in a conspirators whisper  in fact

i hardly know how to explain my errand

   he glanced at the bulging eyes and brist-
ling lips and plunged desperately ahead

   you do not know me but you perhaps
know of me i am certainly not an alarmist
it has come to me that-er-that is i
chanced to everhear a word or two-i am


all-story weekly

afraid that the obelisk is in danger of fire
this very night 

  astonishment being fletchers norma
mien holt was unable to tell whether he
felt it now or not

   word what word what did you
hear

    it was merely a fragment of talk that
came to me in a crowded car lied holt
unable to bring himself to iell the truth
 i couldnt even see who uttered it we
-we were passing through a tunnel at the
time and though i listened nothing more
was said on the subject

  fletcher gazed steadily at holt

   well-of course im obliged he said
at length  but when the obelisk burns
up then cakes of ice will gei-now-spon-
taneous combustion the rate on their
building is rock bottom mostly reenforced
concrete and glass used in it no wooden
stairs or banisters or window sashes only
the doors and office furniture you might
say and i leave it to you if its easy to
kindle a mahogany desk 

   dont seem so admitted holt rising
to go  just felt it my duty to speak of
it-such a fine edifice-civic duty and ail
that sort of thing you know

   sure we appreciate it-but with our
force of watchmen and the materials used
and everything-dont lose any sleep on our
account mr holt have a cigar

  holt refused and escaped red of face
with the impression that fletcher con-
sidered him mildly insane

  nevertheless that night when making
what excuses he could he left home at
eleven-thirty and posted himself in the de-
serted cannon dominated by the obelisk
lovely in its towering whiteness as the
search-lights from the harbor picked it up
he noted the pursy figure of fletcher lurk-
ing in an office entrance across the way
and could not refrain from a grin he was
sorry that fletcher saw him and evidently
fletcher felt the same way about it as he
scuttled back into the shadows like a fat
spider

  a policeman pounded by irving the
doors a newsboy scampered through
empty handed and tailing a short cut home
a shabby nondescript crept past muttering

to himself possibly some former magnate
holt reflected haunting the battle-field of
ancient triumphs taxicabs shot through
from time to time taking advantage of the
absence of traffic

  eleven lifty-iive and so slowly did the
hands seem to move on a big illuminated
dial within holts range of vision that twice
he drew forth his watch to reassure himself
by the spinning second hand then almost
as if the dock hand had leaped over the
last three minutes midnight boomed forth
and simultaneously holt was hurled against
a granite wall by a terrific explosion when
he recovered his wits flames were bursting
from the second and third story windows of
the obelisk

  a long time he watched the firemen at
work as they magically appeared upon the
scene finallv he returned home and to
bed

  he was aroused the following morn by
a message which urgently but courteously
requested his presence at police head-
quarters

  the pop-eyed and bristling fletcher was
seated in the chiefs office when he arrived
breakfastless in a taxi the chief he knew
slightly after the customary desultory
greetings the police head spoke

   last night mr holt the obelisk was
partly wrecked by a powerful explosive
which we have reason to believe was planted
by german spies you may not be aware
that exceedingly valuable reports of their
activities are kept there now mr
fletcher the agent naturally recalled at
once your warning of yesterday i feel sure
you did not tell him all you knew you
were not obliged to of course probably
you dreaded notoriety or feared lest you
implicate some innocent party i can as-
sure you that any information however
trivial it may seem to you is necessary to
me now you shall be fully protected and
no innocent party shall suffer even em-
barrassment  have shown you my cards
will you do the same

   chief if i could i would but  have
absolutely nothing not even a suspicion to
voice 

  the chief smoked in silence for a mo-
ment while fletcher wriggled in the chair
forbidden fruit



into which he was so tightly wedged that
holt irrelevantly wondered how he had got
in or could get out a silly picture of the
pursy agent hobbling out with the chair
clamped to him caused him to laugh
nervously

   you were in the immediate vicinity
mr holt when the bomb exploded sug-
gested the chief seriously

   a sudden resolution seized holt fie de-
termined to tell the whole truth no matter
how ridiculous it made him appear-the
whole truth save only his seance with dr
jones

    im going to tell you everything chief
even though you consider me ripe for a
padded cell he gasped

   thats right approved the officer
settling back comfortably  i knew you
were the sort of citizen we could rely on
shoot

  whereupon holt did he explained that
he had of late been dreaming things which
later came out exactly as he had been
warned he told about his mother giving
the address of the attending physician he
related his purchase of western copper on
a  hunch furnishing the name of the
broker and adding that this was his first
transaction of tjie sort then had followed
the vision of the obelisk fire-there had
been no inkling of an explosion-and on
impulse he had warned fletcher and that
was all

   even as he finished a morning paper was
thrust through the slot in the office door
and rustled to the floor opening face up-
ward as it fell

   the chief glanced at it stooped over and
picked it up and after a startled look
handed it to holt it was a marked  extra
detailing the phenomenal jump of western
copper and the turmoil resulting there-
from

   when flolt after leaving headquarters
and snatching a cup of coftee had proceeded
to his own office he was greeted with the
news that it with several others had been
gutted by a fire the night past he smiled
grimly reflecting that he was a failure so
far as foreseeing that particular and rather
important event was concerned evidently

a prophet had his ups and downs his
visions were not subject to call he could
conceive that daniel himself might foretell
the fall of an empire the very end of the
world and yet never dream that he should
see a live lion

  already he heartily wished the week of
which but two days had passed were wiped
off the calendar he was nervous as a
cat slept poorly had no appetite he
dreaded the recurrence of his visions and
scarcely thought of the tidy fortune he had
made overnight in western copper

  above all his mind dwelt upon his
mother that saintly lady whose life had
been spent in doing her simple duty and
far more in bringing happiness to a wider
circle year by year taxing her strength and
her purse to ease the lot of unfortunates
she hunted up her creed was simple yet
world wide her faith absolute religion
holt clenched his hands why should god
allow that pure and faithful heart that had
beat for so many all these years to throb
out in final agony had she not at the
least earned a gentle sleep a peaceful death
in her bed-as painless as a drunkards
death in his cups ifas there a god
he sought to pul the torturing surmises out
of his mind but he found he lacked the
power

  he tried now to avoid thinking of his
loved ones save in the most casual way
he lived in torment lest as he gazed in his
wifes eyes there should suddenly unroll
before him another of the hated scrolls
whereon he should behold written in letters
of fire her doom he prayed for the blessed
boon of ignorance too late he realized
the frightful isolation of those who share
the gifts of the gods who have eaten of the
forbidden fruit

  deity alone could endure such a blight-
ing burden as omniscience and deity
possessed its anodyne--omnipotence it
could change the measured and implacable
march ol events fend destiny from tender
souls reach dowi protecting hand to the
hopeless and th suffering or-could it
such a record ot the predestined future
which god could inscribe at will could even
he change a single link in its chain disturb
its connective tissue without shattering

past and future because if he could
then no such record could be written one
was forced to deny either divine omnis-
cience or omnipotence the answer of
course was that to god there is no past
nor future eternity was not an endless
line but a circle he visioned all in a hash
even as holt had seen his own puny glimpse
of the yet-to-be

   as if his gift increased with each recur-
rence his visions multiplied to a point
where hb brain seemed to reel beneath the
awful burden on the cars passing along
the crowded streets in his club or wherever
men congregated a blinding series of horo-
scopes danced before his eyes leople in
whom he took not the slightest interest
men and women he vainly tried to recall
ever having seen before casual strangers
bared their futures to him as it seemed

  he glanced at a loutish youth leaning
against an l post a half-consumed cigarette
drooping from lips too indolent lo hold it
and instantly the figure straightened the
eyes cleared the color changed to a virile
bronze and holt beheld a lean khaki-clad
man rifle clutched in firm hand surging
over the top  from some far distant
trench

  or he nodded abstractedly to a great
financier and at once his well-fitting clothes
took on the stripes of prison and he was
doing a lock step for hypothecating the
funds of a trust he had handled for years
in the twinkling of an eye people took on
new forms new faces and assumed now a
tailored prosperity again the cerements of
death

  xor were his business hours encroached
upon his time stolen the slow tragedy of
a decade defiled past him while his heart
throbbed once he was reminded of the
strange experiences of drug-addicts who
lived through unspeakable epochs of world
transformation during the ievoiuiion of a
swiftly moving car wheel and of the
minutely detailed life-historv drowning men
were said to experience

   but in sleep troubled as were his dreams
h never received any prophetic visions
all he supposed must be based upon the
mysterious stores yielded up by his sub-
consciousness but he could not con 

how or when the facts had touched his
senses perfect strangers stood before him
their naked history unexpurgated to his in-
sight he met old friends and received not
a hint of their destiny

  his loneliness was absolute there were
none with whom he could share his burden
the few who might believe him would be
alarmed ar repelled others would con-
sider him unbalanced

  the second real shock to his spirit oc-
curred as he was watching his iittle son
romp on the lawn he was a sturdy lad of
ten neither precocious nor wayward of
a sudden holt beheld him lying in his
casket smeiied the heavy odors of flowers
saw the sun strike through the stained glass
of st-lukes heard the shuffle of little feet
as arthurs mates of the vested choir filed
past to look upon his quiet lace

  with a terrible effort of will he forced
the picture to pass away he felt fatigued
as after violent physical exertion but at
least he had evaded the precise date of the
death the true horror of prophecy was
now clear to him that night as he knelt
by his bed he prayed for the boon of
ignorance for the kindly curtain which he
had presumptuously rent asunder to fall
once more before the blinding future

  late upon a murky afternoon dr jones
packed his old clay pipe and sank into a
broken-springed easy chair with a grunt of
satisfaction he had succeeded in fertiliz-
ing a sea urchins egg in a saline solution
he did not in the least need a sea urchin
there were millions of livelier healthier ones
along the atlantic coast but he had wished
to demonstrate that he could do it- and he
hud

  he picked up his morning paper as yet
unglanced at and prepared to relax before
he had so much as run over the head-lines
his door was flung open without the pre-
liminary of knocking and a disheveled
panting figure collapsed into a chair op-
posite glaring at him from blood-shot eyes

   holt my dear fellow what on earth
is the matter let me get you a drink of
something cold and 

  his visitor stayed him with a violent
gesture
forbidden fruit



   xo i dont want a drink of anything
cold nor hot nor a shot in the arm nor
even any soothing professional twaddle
what i want is your attention 

  the physician regarded him with a
puzzled yet affectionate interest and settled
back in his chair puffing at his pipe

  you have it shoot he said tersely
thereupon holt related in detail his
amazing experiences of the past few days
jones made hurried notes on his cuff and
two or three times interrupted with a
brusk question he seemed deeply in-
terested and with the unfolding of the
story his absorption grew

  when holt paused he spoke excitedly
this is immensely important old man
i can assure you that when i have been able
to check up your facts with absolute pre-
cision the paper ill write will make us
both fam-

  fine interrupted holt gritting his
teeth  but how about me what about
my horrible situation

   oh-that you are of course in a
highly nervous state hysterical jumpy all
that sort of thing perfectly natural too
but i shall be able to point out to you that
you are not to take your subconsciousness
-or rather your conclusions from its
memories-too literally i shall explain-
 how will you explain this whispered
holt leaning forward while his hands
gripped the chair arms  i havent told
you my latest vision jones as truly as 
sit here before you i saw you at precisely
six oclock to-night hugging and-and-
kissing my wife yes damn it and she
was returning your endearments 

  a faint color hooded joness pale face
and astonishment gleamed in his eyes

   what rot he finally gasped why
i never saw her and you know about how
much of a womans man i am even if-er
-your wife gould be-ah-

   nevertheless true as all this is i am so
solemnly sure that it will come to pass ex-
actly as i have seen it and as i have fore-
seen other events fulfilled that i propose
at least to he in your company from now
on until six gel on your hat and come
home with me

  jones started convulsively

   no he protested lock me up-
lock your wife up-do anything you like
but dont bring us face to face in this pre-
posterous fashion

   jones -holts voice was quiet yet
surcharged with omen- you are a doctor
you can see the condition i am in dont
tiy to thwart me

  with one long glance into the others
eyes the physician nodded rose and took
hat and gloves from a table

   lead on he snapped

  it was already well past five when the
two boarded a car at the corner and when
without another word having been ex-
changed they were admitted to the house
the hall clock showed a quarter to the
hour

  the maid who had opened the door de-
tained her master

   that long distance call you expected
from chicago had just come as you rang
sir she said

  holt nodded

    all right ill take it jones just be
seated a moment in there and excuse me
will you the library anna

   as the caller entered the room indicated
the telephone voice of his friend came
plainly to his ears

  it was some minutes later when holt
having finished hurriedly crossed the hall
to the library glancing as he did so at the
clock which was on the very point of strik-
ing six

   three seconds later he stood as if frozen
in the doorway in the very middle of the
room jones the old faithful ascetic jones
held his gentle modest wife in a tenacious
clinch her arms were about his rather
frowsy neck-jones always needed a hair-
cut-and her smooth cheek endured nay
invited his kisses

  somewhat to the onlookers astonishment
he felt no resentment at the extraordinary
spectacle which above all others spells
tragedy pain grief despair all these
gripped him to the full but anger not at
all for he perceived that fate held them
all and moved them about like puppets
jones could no more avoid what was to be
than could he or his spotless wife there
were certain amenities to be gone through

with of course presently he would do
something shoot jones or divorce his wife
or both but not in hot blood

 the betrayer standing with his back to
 the door kolts wife pri-senth raised her-
 self atiptoe and glancing over his shoulder
 perceived her husband

 xo trace of decent shame no f-nsr could
 he descry in her eyes rather she smiled
 sweetly upon him as he stood there drag-
 ging at the portieres

  isnt it wonderful dear

 it is

  but you dont seem to realize its
 frank

  i ought to know i brought him here
 didnt i

 something in his voice arrested her atten-
 tion a little frown on her white brow she
 added- after all these years vv little

 lost baby brother who didnt go down with
 the macedonia aner all

  something gave out in holts legs he
staggered two steps and collapsed on a
divan had it been three steps distant he
would nave hit the floor

  his brain spun round like a giant top
a jumble of half memories spewed up by
his subconsciousness danced before him

  the unquestionable similarity between
their voices and the family nose he was
not aware of having ever noted these yet
he must have done so a trick of lifting
one eyebrow-a mutual hatred of the sea
-above all-

   its strange you didnt bring him here
long ago his wifes slightly querulous
voice broke in upon his thoughts  you
are so stupid you knew my maiden name

       love him hes dear

          and hes got an adorable dimple

       and combs his hair properly
          backward you know with a sweep

        hes tall and well-set

          wiih a manner delightfully simple

       but whenever i see him

          i flee to my boudoir to weep

       im crazy about him

           precisely the sort ive been seeking
        for years upon years

          and his eyes are the color  love

       but ah when he comes to me
         smiiing and eager and joyful

         t fly like a terrified bird
           to mv chambers above

        he comes at all hours

          he writes and he telephones daily

       determined to win-
         ah that look in his loverlike eyes

       but saddened and sore
         at a fate that is cruel-too cruel

preceding chapters briefly retold

ezra wood of rosebloom an elderly man rugged but toil-marked was robbed of eleven
hundred dollars at grand central station which he was bringing to the city to pay off a
mortgage on his home

    chick the young pickpocket who had secured the money was so overborne by the old mans
faith and optimism and a certain virtue that went out from him he returned the money and
met his gang the same night at  the commodore  on the bowery with the astounding news he
was going to go  straight and the way led to the country solly and phil two of his lieutenants
remained unconvinced and their chief sky blue the old man with the face and manners of a
parson and the morals of a bushman ridiculed the very suggestion

    but after helping the girl of the gang myrtle to a ticket to denver where she was to regain
her health and then her hold on the rail of the narrow path chick struck out westward and by
slow stages came to the delaware water gap country

    here he met up with  a native  who informed him  the name of that town over there since
you be asking me is st clair

chapter xii

 flowery harbor

right where st clair and the open
country merged there was a large

	old frame house in a large old gar-
den both showed signs of decay there
were gaps in the white paling fence the
fruit and decorative trees had all grown into
black and scrawny old age there was a
dry fountain - also white originally-
wherein a badly scarred infant throttled a
swan as for the house it could have
known neither paint nor carpentry for twen-
ty years at least

  yet the whole place still radiated a cer-
tain mellow dignity even a certain homely
beauty - honeysuckle running over the
fence a hundred varieties of flowering
weeds and bushes drifting perfume and
color elsewhere wrens robins and martins
this story began in the all-s

   	a-s

contributing their note of cheerfulness and
life

  and that well-known truth that any
mans home is in the nature of a portrait
of himself was amply exemplified in the
present instance when colonel evan wil-
liams appeared through the front door of
the mansion

  he always called it a mansion

  for the colonel-call him that every one
else did-likewise suggested a sort of deco-
rative decay and he was garbed in rai-
ment singularly suggestive to any one with
a grain of imagination of the same state of
affairs he and his clothes were equally
well suited to each other there was noth-
ing sordid about them-nothing that wasnt
dignified yet homelike and friendly

  the colonel had a red facc and a white
mustache-one of those antebellum mus-
taches very heavy that descend far below

the chin he had a droopy blue eye that
was at once belligerent and jovial his
whole face was jovial albeit dignified-es-
pecially his nose which was inclined to be
pendulous and was certainly more highly
colored than the rest of his countenance
he must have been a man of splendid pres-
ence in his day in fact there was still am-
ple evidence of this but now he was in-
clined to sag a little was a trifle heavy on
his feet-just like this old house of his

   he stood there at the top of the broad
stoop like an honored heirloom from an-
other generation he wore a black slouch
hat he carried a gnarled black cane

   he appeared to be waiting for something
or to have fallen into a reverie-you
couldnt have told which from his droop-
ing thoughtful immobility then with a
surprising hint of alertness he cocked his
head and listened

   from somewhere in the back of the house
there sounded forth a girls clear strong
soprano

 he has sounded forth the trumpet that shall
    never sound retreat

he is sifting out the hearts of men before his
     judgment seat

oh be swift my soul to answer him be jubi-
    lant my feet

our god is marching on

    dear child sweet child the colonel
murmured  if  could only spare you
this

   but there was an unmistakable craftiness
about his movements and of judgment ma-
tured through bitter reflection in what fol-
lowed he was sentimental but no senti-
mentality could master him

  from the tail pocket of his frayed
prince albert he brought a rectangle of
pasteboard lie had thought of every-
thing it wasnt for nothing that he had
been reckoned one of the leading young
lawyers of the south there was even a
loop of string through a hole in the paste-
board convenient for its suspension on the
old bell-pull he hung the card in place

   he did this to the rousing chorus

glory glory halleluiah

   still standing there he drew a handker-
chief also from a tail pocket-there were

two of these pockets and each appeared to
be big enough to bin a sack of meal he
wiped his eyes he blew his nose he re-
turned the handkerchief to its place and
brought out in turn something that might
have been a flask

  medicine sir-by my physicians
order-the only prescription you could in-
duce a physician himself to take

  he kept his back turned while he tilted
his head he cleared his throat he re-
turned the thing that might have been a
flask to the storage place at the rear he
straightened up he turned and marched
with becoming dignity down the decrepit
steps

  and all who would might read that here
in the mansion there was a

room to let

   it was the right and beautiful thing you
could tell it by the colonels walk digni-
fied thoughtful his coat-tails swinging
rhythmically he passed on down the garden
walk to the unhinged front gate he passed
on up the street

  it wasnt much of a street-just a sort of
country lane formalized to some extent by
other fences farther on and occasional bits
of sidewalk but such houses as there may
have been were mostly hidden by trees and
shrubbery

  a bluebird sang there was a flash of
red where a cardinal passed the whole
country roundabout and for that matter
the town itself except for two or three
church steeples was smothered in bloom of
sorts-drifts of white and pink where the
apples or the dogwoods the peaches or the
judas-trees were calling to the bees the
bees and the birds-and that as yet invisible
girl-furnished about all the sound there
was-a world therefore set to music

   in spite of all this predicated solitude the
colonels sortie and liis subsequent move-
ments had none the less been duly noticed
-duly and severely noticed

  from the hedge of osage orange on the
other side of the street a pair of eyes had
studied him with all the alert intelligence
of a squirrels and these were the eyes of
mrs meckley who lived over there-in a
if you believe it its so



little cottage as carefully concealed and you
might say as arboreal as any squirrels
house a professional widow mrs meck-
ley-perpetually lonely according to what
she herself always said yet given to close
observation and numerous calls

   room to let she cried to herself when
she made out the colonels sign  the old
reprobate the old miser

  she would have departed then to spread
the tidings only with a twinge of exquisite
excitement she saw that her news budget
was in a fair way of becoming duly am-
plified

    hes goin in

  this second comment was inspired by the
sight of a stranger-an event in itself suffi-
cient to enrich any day the straner had
come into the street from the direction of
the open country and yet there a cer-
tain citified air about him-as there usually
was about strangers after they had been
measured and weighed by local stand-
ards

  the stranger carried a dress-suit case
his clothes were rather badly worn and in
need of pressing still there was an impres-
sion of nattiness about them - from his
velour hat with the brim turned down on
one side right on to his light-tan cloth-
topped shoes

  mrs meckley saw him pause at the sag-
ging gate saw him look after the retreating
form of the colonel as if half persuaded to
run after him then drop his glance at a
faded little plank at the side of the gate
which proclaimed that this was

 flowery harbor

   by crickety whispered mrs meckley
becoming profane in her excitement  hes
goin in

  she wasnt mistaken

  moreover there was an odd suggestion
of romance not only in the strangers youth
and the fashion in which he was dressed
but also in the way he appeared to be im-
pressed by all he heard and saw

  just a vague impression that came to
mrs meckley something which hadnt es-
caped her bright and squirrel-like eyes-
her whole face and even her bodv were

squirrel-like-and yet something that she
didnt wholly comprehend

chapter xiii

as seen and overheard

 alyah morley singing as she
scrubbed the kitchen heard the door-
bell ring-which wasnt surprising in
view of the fact that the bell was mounted
on a spiral spring against the kitchen wall
and was designed to be heard throughout
the house she stopped short in the mid-
dle of a  halleluiah she sat back on her
heels and looked at the bell with the most
perfect astonishment as at a phenomenon
that had never occurred before

  iut her astonishment held her for only a
second or two

  while the bell was still jangling she
scrambled to her feet and untied the apron
that enveloped her

  she was nineteen or so slim plain rather
than pretty with straw-colored hair and not
very rich in color otherwise-still with a
measure of that beauty which always goes
with youth and flushed excitement

  she looked down at her skimpy blue cali-
co dress it was clean at any rate her black
shoes and stockings were passable they
were for this time of day when folks were
supposed to be working anyway but who
could be ringing the door-bell at this hour

  she ran over to a corner of the kitchen
where there was a towel and a small looking-
glass and other toilet accessories she jerked
some water into an enameled basin from a
half-filled bucket she rinsed her hands
and smoothed her hair all with a nervous
energy so speedy that she had completed
the operation by the time that the old bell
was just quivering back into silence

  around in front the stranger who had
rung the bell stood there at the top of the
rickety stoop and patiently waited he
knew that there was some one home there
had been the song of the girl he knew
that his ring had been heard he had
heard it himself- -and the song had stopped
and he didnt even wonder what the girl
looked like xor did he greatly care

so there was a room to let in flowery

harbor some name and that old gent
with nerve enough to take a swig on his
front door-step and still swing his coat-
tails like that would most likely be the
landlord say this old man was human

  he stood there like that with the smell
 of honeysuckle in his nose and the echo of
 the girls voice still in his ears and a propi-
 tious impression of the colonel on the sur-
 face of his brain

  he felt the first subtle creep of a hunch
 he had been waiting for

   i-i-beg your pardon

  he turned

  some instinct of caution-or some other
 instinct less easily defined-had sent alvah
 to scurrying around the side of the house
 through the garden instead of through the
 gloomy interior of the house itself she
 stood there now at the corner of the building
 -there where the mossy brick path passed
 under a tunnel more or less well defined of
 clematis syringa and lilac

   how do you do said the stranger
 he had set his suit-case down he
 jerked his right hand to his hat but he
 left the hat in place this was no lady
 standing over there this was nothing but
 a kid

   how do you do said the kid plainly
 at a loss

   is your mother in

    no sir 

   i came to see about the room maybe
 yqu can tell me about it

   what room

   say do you live here

   my home is in bangor maine

   well do you work here then i want
 to find out about this here room

   theres nobody home

  you said it no honestly aint no-
 body here

  all this was just nuts and candy for old
 mrs meckley across the way she could
 get most of the conversation by straining a
 lot and she was straining

   i the girls a flirt she passed judgment
  she ought to be switched

   only me alvah was saying

  despite the sagacious deduction of mrs
 meckley from what had already transpired
 alvah had an appearance of timidity-of

 timidity touched with doubt and not a little
 fear as if she were not quite certain but
 that she was in the presence of some one
 slightly deranged she was reassured to
 some extent however by the strangers next
 move

  he calmly seated himself on the none-too-
solid railing of the stoop

   good night he exclaimed in spite of
the manifest morning  when are you
expecting the old gent back

   he was going to the post-office he
wont be long

   birdies there with the goods this time
anyway all right birdie ill wait
greek to alvah but nothing unpleasant
about it now that the stranger wasnt
looking at her she could look at him she
discovered that he wasnt hard to look at
his face rather fascinated her he certainly
had wonderful eyes ifis voice and his lan-
guage were unmistakably american but he
looked like a foreigner

  she dared advance a step

  as she did so she saw that there was
something suspended on the bell-pull she
advanced some more

  the next time that the stranger looked
at her he saw that she was standing as if
hypnotized staring at the announcement
that here there was a room to let there
was a touch of drama in her appearance
that did not escape him-the unaffected
pose of her slight frame her hands folded
against her meager breast and he noticed
without exactly appraising them the fine
line of her cheek and chin the whiteness
and nobility of her forehead all this never-
theless with a touch of condescension on his
part-as an older and wiser person annoyed
by the persistent ignorance of a dull child
 whats the matter he asked

   that sign-it isnt so-some one put it
there for a joke

   i guess you get another think he said
without discourtesy   see the old gent
hangin it up himself not ten minutes ago
 my uncle

   gee it takes a ion time to get it across
sure the old gent that just came out of
here whats the matter

  the girl had continued to stare at the
sign with scarcely another glance for the
if you believe it its so



visitor but now she looked at him square-
ly the while a warmer coloring came into
her face and a shadowy brightness into her
hitherto rather cool gray eyes

   you are certain you saw my uncle put
that sign there

   sure thats what im tellin you-
takes it out of his pocket and hangs it up
just before he beats it up the street i
aint stringin you

   but oh he didnt mean it

  she was no longer afraid of the stranger
she ran lightly up the stoop she took the
sign from the place where it hung hid the
letters of it against her breast

   whats the idea the young man in-
quired softly with a direct invitation to
confidence  whats wrong aint he got
a right to rent a room if he wants to is
the place so overcrowded has everybody
got too much coin or dont he own the
house or what

  the questions merely bewildered the girl
at the same time it was evident that most
of them went home

   you dont understand she answered
appealingly

   you said it

   my uncles not always himself

  the confession hurt her still some sort
of explanation was in order

   you mean hes sort of hittin up the
booze

  her troubled eyes were her only answer
it was affirmation enough

   you dont want to let that worry you
mabel-

   my name is alvah-alvah morley

   glad to meet you alvah thats what
im tellin you the old gent looked all
to the good to me

   hes the finest man in the world the
girl flamed from the midst of her trouble
 only there are times like the present
when he does things that he wouldnt do-
if-only-

   look- the stranger began

  but there came a diversion the girl
with an exclamation of mingled relief and
consternation ran down the steps she was
out of the gate she had seen her uncle
coming back from the post-office

  all this was as good as a play to mrs

 meckley over there behind her screen of
 osage orange

chapter xiv

mr richard davies

the youth on the stoop had had a mo-
ment of hesitation he came down
the steps however and met the girl
and the old gentleman half-way to the gate

    ah the old gentleman exclaimed

  i see the sign i come in i ring the
 bell-

    i told him- the girl began

 sir i have the honor and the old
 gentleman removing his hat and thrusting
 his stick under his arm offered his hand

 there was a suggestion in the move that
  got to  the stranger as he himself would
 have said-got to him in a pleasant sort of
 way the stranger had also pulled his hat
 had taken the proffered hand had done this
 with a quick but not ungraceful bow

  permit me to introduce myself said
 the elder although that may not be neces-
 sary i am rather widely known perhaps
 you have heard of the williamses weve
 had a fairly active part in the history of our
 country

   sure everybodys heard about the-
williamses

  i am evan williams

  glad to meet you colonel

  ah i see that you are familiar with
 my honorary title

sure replied the young man who
didnt understand

  and may i be so bold as to ask you
 to refresh my memory it seems to me that
 we have met

  i dont believe so colonel

  your name is

 there was a perceptible pause

 my name

 they were still locking hands in the orig-
 inal grasp their eyes had met

 davies the young man answered

  a splendid name one that makes you
 doubly welcome sir i dare say the wil-
 liamses and the davies were fighting side by
 side long centuries ago

     ill take your word for it


all-sttiry weekly

   and vour christian name it i mav
ask  

   richard

   richard davies why sir - it pos-
sible you are doubtless a descendant of
that celebrated bishop richard davies-do
you recall-whom queen elizabeth called
her  second st david 

   you may be right at that

   for you are cymric pardon the per-
sonality but i could tell it by your appear-
ance even if it were not for your fine old
cambrian name

   do i get the room

   i shall be delighted iet us inspect the
premises mr davies

  uncle

  colonel williams turned to his niece with
mellow good humor

   what will the neighbors say sne de-
manded confused

   say a most stirring event a davies
become a guest in the house of a william
a celtic reunion didnt i tel you all the
time that it would be well with us if we ac-
cepted a lodger or two come in sir
well seal our acquaintance as gentlemen
should  he made a pawing movement with
his hand to assure himself that his flask wa-
in the old familiar place  tis none too
early in the morn to touch the lyre

  there was space enough in the williams
mansion for many guests

  beyond the front door there was a broad
hall high and long up two sides of which
ran a flight of steps to the second floor
four large rooms opened off the hall

   on the left the drawing-room said
the colonel while alvah morley looked on
wide-eyed shrinking yet with a touch of
rebellion in her attitude  on the right
the library back of the drawing-room our
parlor or living-room and opposite that the
dining-room i regret the absence of ser-
vants and my inability to keep the place
up

  it looks good to me breathed mr
richard davies

    as soon as i can get the e-tate settled -
the estate of my brother abner sir u
which i have devoted not unwillingly the
best years of my life i shall proceed to the
refurnishing of the house

  it look good to me the one-time
chick repeated

  he wa- glad now that he had given his
one and only true name to the old gentle-
man the hall reared its gloomy grandeur
about him there were no carpets on the
floor the paper on the wall was stained
by time and leakage for it was evident that
the roof of the mansion was no longer at its
best but there was a solemnity about this
acceptance of him in a home like this that
at once weighted upon him and lifted him
up the place not only looked good to
him it looked almost too good

   theres only one thing colonel he
broke out softly as soon as the girl had
disappeared into the cavernous shadows at
the rear of the hall  you havent said any-
thing about the price

   of what sir

   the room

   my dear sir you are my guest as long
as you care to remain i am honored

   ah say 

   xot a word sir 

  the colonel also had noticed the retire-
ment of his niece he cast a further glance
to assure himself that they were alone he
brought his flask from its hiding-place he
uncorked it elaborately wiped its gullet with
his hand

   as our ancestors did under rhodri
mawr  he invited

   xot for mine im on the wagon

   you mean

   thanks im leavin it alone

   sir i honor you but thirty years
ago my physician-it was-

   look out the younger man whispered
 theres the young lady

  the colonel cleared his throat and put the
bottle away

  it was to a bedroom on the second floor
that mr richard davies eventually carried
his suit-case-a room that was larger than
the back room of the commodore near
chatham square and there were windows
in it that gave both on the old garden and
on the far country beyond

   it looks good to me said the lodger

  looked good to him it all looked so
good that it almost hurt this was the
thing he had come out to find lonely
if you believe it its so



sure ever since he had left xew york
but he wasnt going to weaken xot yet
maybe after a while hed duck maybe
why not con himself along maybe after
a while hed just naturally get sick of trying
to make a living by selling soap or other
things and nick some rube for his roll-
for keeps this time

  and then right then from the combina-
tion of all the things that were coming to
him through the open window-sky and
earth air and bird-song-something that
recalled old ezra wood not as a rube but
as a white and shining giant who had ex-
erted a strange influence over him

  it was almost as if he could hear that
good old man speak again

    the lord have pity on us all

    every day most a hundred years i on ft each
year a imppy lifetime

    if hed stayed in the country we might have
saved him

   ah hell he said  this is fierce i
wonder what phil and solly are pullin to-
day and old sky-blue and myrtle

  way back

  say this was it way back a million
miles

  and he had become mr richard davies
he was glad that he had laid that name
aside and kept it clean-laid it aside so
many years ago that he could hardly re-
member when but he did remember indis-
tinctly the dark-eyed woman who had been
his mother and more indistinctly yet mist-
ily the gray specter who had been his
father the specter of a distinguished man
who had been mr richard davies also
then the night flame and smoke wherein
his parents disappeared they must have
been living in a poor neighborhood old
denny the wood-merchant had become his
foster-parent and that was when he was
eight years old

   mr davies 

  the girl was calling him

  he stepped over to the door so swiftly
and opened it so deftly that it frightened
her

   my uncle wants to know she recited
 if you will do us the honor of taking tea
with us

   sure much obliged

   it  be at about dark she said
 uncle likes to eat his supper by candle-
light

  tell him ill be there and much
obliged

  he stood there in his door and watched
her go away a pale shape disappearing in
the shadows toward the back of the upper
hall now that he thought of it he some-
how or other felt sorry for this kid

chapter xv

i p tik street

but also he felt sorry for himself he
couldnt help it there was something
about this very room that recalled that
vaguely remembered home of his childhood
when his parents were still alive--bare walls
with broken plaster no carpet on the floor
a somewhat caved-in bed in the corner of
the room there was even something remi-
niscent in the flowers the greenery and the
bird-song

  he guessed the truth

  there was a geranium on the window-
sill of that earlier home a neighbor had
a canary in a cage

  he pulled off his shoes he partly un-
dressed himself he cast a longing gaze
at the bed it seemed to him that he hadnt
slept since leaving the old town back there
and he always did prefer sleeping in the
daytime a dreaminess drew him he
wasnt hungry he had eaten a hearty
meal not much more than an hour ago at
a farmers house a mile or so back along
the road and the farmer had refused to
take a cent for his hospitality none the
less memory of this meal brought up a hun-
dred souvenirs of savory chinese and ital-
ian dishes in the city he had left wouldnt
it be great after all to wake up and find
a dish of chop-suey at his side

  he crawled onto the bed and let himself
go

  he slept the afternoon away and in-
stantly when he awoke there flashed into
his thought a clear and concise record of
the girl of this house and of the colonel
her uncle and of the house itself the


all-story weekly

record brought with it a little mental groan
what was he that he should thus let them
think that he was their equal that he
should take a room in this house of theirs
set himself up as the son or the grandson
or something of a bishop

  the only answer to these questions was a
pang of homesickness so poignant that he
could have wept

  then he listened to the silence and the
silence weighed upon him as the earth might
weigh upon the chcst of a man buried alive
there for a minute or so the silence was
absolute not even a bird twittered not
a wheel turned no one spoke

    i got to get back he whispered  ill
stick it out a day or so longer but i got
to get back

  he crept over to the window in his bare
feet and looked down into the garden he
saw alvah morley down there she was
picking flowers he saw that she had
changed her dress he wondered why and
he noticed that she wasnt such a kid as
he had believed her to be more like a
school-teacher she was-a white cotton
dress fresh and crinkly from the wash her
straw-colored hair drawn back in a smooth
knot and ornamented with a blue silk rib-
bon

  what if she knew the sort of life he had
led

  he wondered where her uncle was the
colonel might hit up the booze but he
was none the less the gentleman  what
am i to rub elbows with him even if 
am mr richard davies and wasnt the
colonel a prince when it came to speaking
english he was

   my uncle hasnt come home yet said
the girl as he came down-stairs after a
while  i suppose that we shall have to
wait for him-unless youre in a hurry

   me in a hurry say what do you do
around here at night

   after supper we talk-sometimes--and
sometimes  try to play the organ only its
not in very good condition sometimes i
read to uncle sometimes he read to me

  there was almost always that provisional
sometimes in all she said as she spoke
moreover she turned now with acute ex-
pectancy again with lingering patience to

look in the direction whence she expected
her uncle to appear

   wheres he gone - the post-office
again

   he cant have gone to the post-office
said the girl  for st clair only gets one
mail a day and thats the first thing in the
morning

  the sun had gone down it was getting
so dark that mrs meckley from behind her
screcn of osage orange could not make out
much any more but two dim figures ohe
of them pale and one of them dark seated
on the steps of the stoop across the way

   scandalous i call it she repeated-re-
peated it over and over always as if with
the lurking hope that the phrase would
serve as an incantation to bring something
scandalous about

  the crickets had been singing since a
long time a chirring pulsation of sound
as if it were the sound of a mill which
itself was manufacturing the material of
the night now and then a frog croaked
in and across the deepening blue where
the stars were beginning to shimmer a few
bats zigzagged reeled wavered swiftly out
of sight

   do you want me to go and find out
where he is davies asked

  the girl shook her head

   arent you afraid somethin might a
happened to him

  she sat motionless it was so dark by
this time that he could not see her expres-
sion if she had answered he had not
heard

   what are those queer little chippies
scootin around up there

  her voice reached him strangled

   those are bats

  the conversation lapsed

   say he exclaimed at iast  i dont
want you to think im fresh or trying to
butt in understand but  sort of fee that
the colonels a friend of mine see and
im going out to look for him

   will you she panted oh if i were
a man

   im a man whats the answer

  the clairvoyance of the strain she was
under helped her to understand

   theres a place-you go up this street
if you believe it its so



to the second corner and then you turn
to your left until you come to the last
building on the left im sure hes there

    ill just tell him youre sort of waiting

   he may not want to come home

   they never do but say- he
started to explain that he had been handling
booze-fighters al his life both friend and
foe but he checked himself the girl
wouldnt understand he wound up by
wondering where he had left his hat

  she brought it to him

   dont weaken he said  keep a
stiff upper lip

   i will she whispered

  but say he wondered what could it be
like when the girl was all alone and the old
gent out on a spree like this he could see
it all the colonel had begun to get his
spree properly started early in the day-
maybe the night before as it usually hap-
pened

  one thing was sure he himself was
feeling uncommonly fit apart from the
fact that he was a little hungry he hail
never felt in better shape in hi- life this
training out in the country was sure the
real thing his wind was perfect his
muscles had suppled up and hardened the
long sleep of the afternoon had ironed out
his nerves it was a pity that there wasnt
a mill on with an open challenge say
feeling like this he could just about lick
anything between welter and light-heavy

  he was so absorbed in his thought and
the general fragrant quality of the night
that he barely noticed what there was to
be seen of this town he had stumbled into
xot much to be seen anyway-a few
lighted windows dimly visible through black
bushes and trees a smelly grocery store
dimly lit by a kerosene-iamp a white church
closed and dark more houses in the midst of
yards then a barber-shop and this was the
second corner the girl had mentioned

  he turned to the left

  it was the supper-hour evidently and
every one indoors he didnt meet a soul
say if the yeggs ever did discover this burg
it would be good-night-nurse for th local
bank or anything else theyd want to crack
but the air was sure all right

  he breathed deeply he was feeling so

good that he shadow-boxed a little he
may have been welsh as the colonel had de-
clared him to be and the welsh have the
reputation of being a mystic race

  was there some divine urge in all this
spontaneous unconscious preparation and
preparation for what if not for some sort
of a combat as richard davies-his right
name-just now in his heart had hankered
for

  he had just come in sight of what must
have been the place the girl had mentioned
the last building up this street brilliantly
lighted as compared with the rest of the
town by a number of oil-lamps with reflec-
tors a road-house or hotel apparently
well-patronized with a dozen muddy autos
and farm-wagons parked along its front
but what davies particularly noticed was
that there was a row in progress at that
end of the building devoted to its bar

  he could hear the squabble of voices
and laughter he could catch a fleeting
effect of shadows on the window-shadows
that moved rapidly he felt an instant
surge of something almost like happiness
al first this was the life say this was
almost like the bowery and he started
to run

  but he was still a dozen yards from the
door of the barroom when the nature of
the thing that was happening struck him
full till stopped him and stopped his
breath

  a familiar figure was being hustled
through the door that was the colonel
they were flinging out as davies saw

  the colonel was flung out he stumbled
lie fell he rolled

  oh a quick intake of the breath
and davies felt as if he himself had been
fouled -kicked-hit below the belt

chapter xvi

against all comers

the colonels slouch hat and his cane
followed him-followed him so fast
that they were in the dirt of the road
at the colonels side even before davies him-
self got there

he was enough of the fighter both in-


all-story weekly

stinctive and trained not to lose his tem-
per anyway it wasnt anger that was
actuating him yet so much as sorrow in
that spectacle of the old man thrown into
the street he saw the wreck of a lot of
things-of pride and education and of the
affectionate hopes of that girl-that poor
little kid-who was waiting now all dressed
up in her picnic clothes back there in the
big old house

  he was at the old mans side before the
colonel himself could make a movement
of recovery

   are you hurt

  alvah

   this aint alvah this is your old
friend dick gimme your hand what
did those bums do to you

  he wasnt asking the question for in-
formation precisely he had seen well
enough what had been done to the colonel
but he had to say something while he was
getting the colonel to his feet-had to do
it to stifle his own mind if for no other
reason

  the door of the barroom was becoming
jammed by those who wanted to get the
most out of the spectacle some had been
pushed out of the door even by friends
behind who were struggling to get a better
view most of the spectators were con-
vulsed this was the funniest thing they
had seen for a long time gus sure had
landed the colonel on his ear but had
you seen the colonel try to fight back
this would be a good lesson for the old
rummy him talking about his honor -
and fighting duels some one should have
landed him on his ear before

  davies heard all this the colonel must
have heard it too the colonel was meek
and humiliated he wasnt greatly hurt in
a physical way xone the less he had be-
come the tottering old man he hadnt
been so drunk after all or perhaps the
misadventure had sobered him anyway
he cast a look of such utter chagrin shame
weakness appealing despair at this one last
friend he had left in the world that davies
felt something crack inside his heart

  he turned and walked straight over
toward the group at the barroom door he
was so calm and smooth and swift that no

one could have suspected what was up be-
sides davies wasnt looking at any one
in particular his dark eyes were off at a
slant still he could see everything

  he saw the two nearest members of the
jovial mob they were both big men as to
weight and stature both were laughing

   go on and laugh davies advised

  he swung with his right and gave a
straight-arm jolt with his left the right
landed on whiskers and a jaw the left
went  and on into the region of a solar-
plexus but finally stopped against a weight
so heavy that it was all he could do to
push it over

  at that he still had time and strength
to shove an open-handed jab into another
grinning face and jerk his elbow up under
the chin of some one else

   laugh you bunch of mails

  hes hit the commissioner kill him

   git out o my way

   grab him boys get him look out
youre walkin on mr crane

   ill learn you to rough-house yuh
stiffs

   look out ding-dcrn ye help

  but it was not until he was in the bar-
room itself that davies clearly perceived
what he had come to seek there was al-
ready a movement among those who had
lingered at the bar to join the riot at the
door davies had an eye for these he
sized them up en masse he saw that they
could have made up the average barroom
crowd almost anywhere-in new york as
much as in any village-riffraff heavy re-
spectables lightweight sports and weaklings
but it was not for these diat his attention
was predestined

  he saw the bulking form of a man dressed
in dirty white bullet-headed thick in the
neck making his way around the end of the
bar and he needed no label at all to tell him
that this was the original victor in the fight
with the colonel

  everything had been going so fast that
there had been no time as yet for readjust-
ments

  they were still jostling each other over
at the door trying to get a line on what had
happened those at the bar were only sure
of one u ig thus far and that was that the
ii vou believe it its so



colonel had been thrown out on his neck
gus had told them so and gus himself
may have thought that this fresh throb
of excitement back of him was merely some
sort of a fresh demonstration of enthusiasm
for the prowess he had shown

   then the lightning struck

   it was blinding at first-dazzling-mak-
ing it hard to see just what had happened

  but gus seemed to know rough-house
as he himself would have said was his
middle name nature had endowed him
with the thews and the constitution of a
bull yet he had passed his life in saloons
in labor-camps and mill-touns in the biack
valleys of pennsylvania along the water-
fronts of boston cleveland san francisco

    look out

   some one at the bar had that much scne

   gus ducked lie turned a little to see
that a stranger had entered the bar and
that the stranger was out for blood vhy
hadnt some one tipped him off that the
colonel had a son or something somebody
who was likely to come back the slob
had almost pasted him one while his back
was turned

  but gus was equal to the occasion-or
thought that he was he slid his bulk
back of the bar still crouching conscious
that on occasions like this somebody was
likely to shoot he hoped that the mirror
wouldnt be smashed still it was better
to have a smashed mirror than a bullet
through the neck

   while all this was glancing through his
elemental mind his big paw had neverthe-
less shot out in the direction of his bung-
starter-a slender mallet of heavy wood
and a weapon as he had been trained to

   but he didnt get the chance to use it

  that enemy of his also knew something
about barroom tactics-knew that there was
apt to be an arsenal of sorts behind the
wet counter say this was just like a gang-
fight only he would have to be the gang
all by himself

   and davies look a short cut in an effort
to reach the arsenal first tie slid right
over the bar and landed on his feet the
next moment he had his two hand locked
on the big barkeeps throat and was pushing
him back toward the open

 it was desperate work-a welterweight
 against a heavy and no room to maneuver
 about in

 gus flailed and kicked

   show you

 -	will yuh

 there was a crash of glass jangling down
 from a polished pyramid of glasses that had
 stood on the shelf back of the bar and a
 trickle of red from the side of guss face

 and there they were in the open

 they stood there face to face a couple
 of yards between them in the middle of
 the barroom-sawdust on the floor a drift
 of blue tobacco-smoke in the air a sub-
 sidence of racket and confusion about them

 in the midst of it all davies heard a
 number of voices

  rush him

  gil the marshal

  git a gun git a rope

 it was evident that he wasnt going to
 have very much time to do whatever he had
 to do a look of pain came into his face
 i le grabbed his left shoulder with his hand
 lurched a little a feint

 gus rushed him believing the stranger
 already hurt

 as he did so however davies side-
 stepped and met him with a left hook to the
 chin then he heaved all his strength and
 weight into another right swing for the
 big mans neck he landed

 something whirled past daviess head and
 smashed itself against the wall then the
 mob was invading the ring

  missed him rush him help help
 kout rr yll be hillin gus

 daviess mind hashed him a picture of
 something like this that had happened be-
 fore-a mill in a frowzy little fighting club
 and the favorite getting the worst of it and
 then the riot with himself and his seconds
 fighting against such odds as these

chapter xvii

ttie peace angel

 he did now what he did then he zig-
 zagged too shifty and quick for any-

 he didnt have far to go and he had a


all-story weekly

chair just in time to wallop it down on the
back of guss neck and shoulders and the
chair collapsed so did gus-for the mo-
ment he did-sprawled right on in the direc-
tion he had been going legs spraddling
hands out

  here is the thing that stamped itself on
daviess mind

  gus was falling just as the colonel had
fallen yea bo gus had got his

  a long way of stating-and yet the only
way to stale it-the concept of an in-
stant

  and then the crowd as much as davies
himself was aware that the collapsed chair
was a very dangerous weapon-more than
dangerous it was before it collapsed for
davies had jerked it apart

  he flung the back of it like a whirling
boomerang and before he heard the shat-
tering of the mirror-if he heard it at all-
he had jerked the solid seat of the chair
straight into the welter of shapes in front of
him what he did with the rest of the chair
he never did exactly know but there he
was at last with a leg of the thing in
his hand-and also the painful but certain
knowledge in his brain that the next step
might be fatal

  he was ready for it there are times
when no man can turn back this was one
of them

  there was a momentary truce at any
rate

   the next of youse guys he panted
 who makes a false move-gets this

  there was sufficient inspiration for a
truce especially on the part of the crowd-
this stranger standing there like a black
panther at bay gus sprawled on the floor
three or four other friends and neighbors
scattered about bruised and bleeding the
big bar-mirror splintered glasses smashed
all this as the swift sequence of a little low
comedy natural to the ejection of an unde-
sirable old customer

  but the truce couldnt possibly in the
nature of things last very long another
explosion was bound to follow and one
did

  only it wasnt the kind they had looked
for

  davies saw it first his attention had

to be everywhere the attention of the
others was concentrated on him only

  he saw old colonel evan williams com-
ing in through the outer door which was
open he saw that the colonel was not
alone-saw that he was accompanied by
alvah morley his niece-and that alvah
still in her picnic dress and without a hat
her straw-colored hair tied with a blue rib-
bon was very stiff and very white she
was just like a dead girl who had come
to life and come walking into this place
to make men feel ashamed of themselves

  she came accompanied by music so far
as davies was concerned in the tomblike
silence that wallowed over everything and
everybody like a descent of noiseless water
he could hear a fine remote phonographic
record of that song she had sung in the
morning

gory glory halleluiah

glory glory halleluiah

  she stared about her whilely she saw
davies spoke to him with all emotion re-
pressed

   i was sorry thai  let you come for my
uncle  waited a while then thought that
i had better come myself

  she was making a simple explanation
her voice was cold and clear soft yel pene-
trating

  some one bawled

 youd do better to keep him hum

  the girl gave a slow glance in the direc-
tion the voice came from and silence de-
scended again once more she turned to
davies

  go on he adjured its all right
take the colonel home ill tend to this
mob

  all the time that he spoke-and his sen-
tences came out sharp and fast-he scat-
tered his glances over the others in the room
some were looking at the girl some looked
at him there was a tremor of suspended
action peril in the air

  yellow light sawdust floor with gus
sprawled in the center of it bar in the
background a stupid bewildered crowd

  tragedy drama

  say was this the village of st clair or
the big man-eating soul-mauling city
if you belieye it its so



 whence he had fled it was a thought that
 frightened him right then and there in the
 midst of al this excitement

 the crowd scuffled and muttered

  serves m right

  o right

  gits

  the colonel

  whats happened

  whats at she says

  quit pnshin

 and then davies thinking that he saw
 a movement to crowd the girl jumped for-
 ward with his stick

  git back he grated  er il send yuhs
 all to hell 

 there was a brief stampede which gave
 him elbow room yet the crowd was grow-
 ing swelled by fresh arrivals from other
 parts of the building and the street outside

  this gentleman is my friend the col-
 onel cried

  take him out davies told the girl

 she eyed the crowd she looked at him
 all this was transpiring in lurid moments
 the girl had put out her hand to his arm
 there may have been some slight hint that
 she was losing her splendid grip on herself

  i found him outside she said  he
 was trying to get in he wouldnt go with-
 out you are you ready to leave

 davies still ready for action eyed the
 crowd

  sure

 some one else spoke up

  he dont leave here except hes lead
 er goin to jail

 again the girl turned

  you neednt hide sam bosely i sup-
 pose your folks will be glad to know you
 were here drinking again when you swore
 you wouldnt and that on your bended
 knees

  i did not snarled sam

 but there were cries of  shut up and
  get out of the way

 a number of the citizens were salving
 the fallen barkeeper in the midst of their
 efforts gus-under his own power so to
 speak-got up as far as a sitting position

  bring him some whisky

 gus let out a roar  xobody go behind
 that bar but mo

  he moaned and rocked he felt the
back of his head

  the girl was letting her cool eyes focus
n face after face some of the men she
looked at backed away and made ready to
depart

   beat it said davies  this is my
scrap  dont need any help

   this is my battle sir the colonel
broke in

  there may have been those present who
thought that this was a signal for a resump-
tion of the comedy it was about time for
a reaction and they were right in a way
but not altogether the colonel had broken
away from his niece he was completely
sobered that was evident he stood
there solidly with his feet wide apart his
gnarled cane gripped in one hand his slouch
hat in the other

  hut again the girl interposed

   i know you all she said  if you do
anything to this young man youll all be
there as witnesses-you mr snow with
your sister-in-law as a character witness
and you hank purvy expecting to marry
a woman whose husbands not dead yet
and you caspar clark after breaking your
mothers heart

   taint so

   shes got ye hank

   yere a liar

  bui the girls quiet voice dominated the
other voices

   your license goes -she was facing
gus who was still staggered but able to
stand- if it takes the rest of my life
my god bellowed gus as if i
aint got trouble enough

   close yer yip said a tough young
farmer shifting his eyes from the girl to
ius  close yer yip yuh big fat ferriner
if yuh dont-

  the girl turned coldly to her uncle and
davies

   come on she said  well go

  they went

  they left the barroom without haste and
not a word or a hand was raised to stay
them davies even lingered a moment it
was to speak a word to the tough young
farmer just one word

   thanks


all-story weekly

  but the young farmer was even too tough
for such brief amenities he looked away
and davies smiling slightly but still with
that chair-leg in his hand in case of emer-
gency followed the colonel and his niece
out into the night

chapter xyii

the touch divine

they walked in silence and they
walked slowly until they were well
beyond the zone of light and sound
that encompassed the hotel at first the
colonel was between davies and the girl
they were supporting him for he still tot-
tered he was like one who would have
collapsed and would have done so willingly
were it not for the strength they were lend-
ing him

 richard said the colonel weakly

    yes sir

   i trust that you were not hurt

   they never touched me

   they were cowards breathed the girl
with suppressed tumult

   not cowards the colonel protested
 they defied me but they were not gen-
tlemen they took me unawares

   if it hadnt been for you folks davies
declared with ebbing passion  i would
have just about croaked a couple of those
yahoos and taken my chance at the chair

   i beg pardon said the colonel he
explained im a little deaf in my right
ear richard let me walk on the other
side of you they shifted their positions
and davies was ne-t to the girl  you
behaved with the utmost gallantry the
colonel pursued  you showed your welsh
descent twas thus they fought-your an-
cestors and mine-under rhodri mawr and
owen glendower

   they were easy

   easy for one who bears the name of
richard davies blood will tei one gen-
tleman like you is always worth a score
from the mob

  davies was silent should he speak up-
tell them who he wa- and where he came
from what sort of a life he had lived
who his associates had been why not

he couldnt go on fooling a friend and
this old man was his friend it made him
feel ashamed of himself why not come
right out and tell the colonel all about it
then make a getaway

  while he was thus debating with himself
and the colonel was talking on and on in an
effort to cover up the awkwardness of the
situation and conceal his own confusion
something happened that held davies silent
cause a faint tremor to run through him-
to run through him body and soul so he
himself ouid have confessed had he been
given to that form of speech

  and yet it was nothing much this thing
that had happened

  at first it was a mere touch on his arm

   my father and mother passed out when
i was pretty young he had begun

  and then alvah had taken his arm the
light and slender curve of her palm was
about his elbow at first he thought that
this was a mere gesture of impulse then
the pressure although still light became
fixed and real

   it is a pity richard the colonel said
 they would have been proud of you

  davies could not tear his attention away
from the feel of the girls light hand she
trusted him as much as the colonel did
that was clear should he let her also know
that he had been a crook all his life one of
the most expert pickpockets-if he did say
it himself-that even new york had ever
known but right on top of this question
came some fierce assertion from his heart
that she was right in trusting him that
he was to be trusted

   it was still early but the dark village lay
somnolent about them the maple-trees
that lined the path and the vines and
bushes-rose and honeysuckle syringa and
lilac-that filled the dewy front yards trans-
formed the street into a temple dusky mys-
terious where miracles might be performed
all this impressed itself on davies some-
what like the charge of a spiritual mob
should he prove himself any less of a fighter
in the presence of this mob than he had in
the presence of that other

  he deliberately looked at the girl al-
though his glance was brief he wondered
how he could have thought of her as a
if you believe it its so



kid he couldnt even think of her as a
woman-not in the terms of womanhood
such as he had always known

   tall slender dimly white a look of pain
and grief and desire on her face all these
veiled to some extent by a dominant cour-
age

   my parents also died when i was
young she said

   and her eyes met richards only for a
second and yet for a long time after he was
lookin ahead again he could recall the
look

    ive lived a pretty hard life he said

   this time alvah did press his arm there
was no mistaking it xor was there any
mistaking of the meaning of it

    brace up was what the pressure said

   all this time the colonel was speaking
but his words had become a monologue
with himself for audience as for davies
he walked alone with this girl at his side
it was almost a- if she herself did not exist
-not as an earthly entity so far as davies
was concerned

   what if his friends and pals back in xew
york could see him now wouldnt they
laugh they would theyd wonder what
he was up to they wouldnt understand
they wouldnt understand that the touch of
this clean and decent hand on his arm was
something wonderful and strange

  perhaps the street had become a temple
where miracles could be wrought in-
wardly davies was panting it was with a
stress of emotion which he did not analyze

  as soon as he could he went up to his
room with the small brass lamp that the girl
told him would be his he closed the door
he found that there were wooden shutters
at the window still more or less effective
despite the absence of numerous slats he
closed the shutters he put the lamp 
the floor and brought out his suit-case from
where he had shoved it under the bed

  there was some spare linen and few
toilet articles in the suit-case not much
its principal contents comprised about half
a hundred cakes of soap in small and savory
packages of polished and gaily printed
paper

  this thing of being a soap-agent had
struck him as just a trifle belter than any-

thing else when he was getting avvav from
xew york a former friend had given him
the tip long ago that a soap-agents path
led to pleasure and profit should he ever
care to disappear from the big town for any
iength of time

   only the motive had been different from
those his friend had implied he had been
starting clean and soap meant cleanliness
and soap was something that he could talk
about urge folks to use it was something
that he liked and was fond of using himself

   he looked at the supply on hand

   should he take it with him or should he
leave it it was heavy word was likely
to be sent for miles around to the marshals
and constables the sheriffs and small-town
police to be on the lookout for a soap-agent
who had roughed things in st clair and
yet if he left his soap behind wouldnt he
be bidding good-by right then to this new
life of his wouldnt he and how long
would it be before he was back at the old
trade again easy money

   again in imagination he could feel the
touch of alvah morleys hand on his arm
say that was what he was running away
from nd yet he would take it with him
it would be there always

  yep

  just when he was going to gyp some-
bodys leather there would come that touch
on his arm and he would lose his nerve

chapter xix

hound hand and foot

he closed the suit-case and strapped it
he took a bill-fold from his hip-
pocket and from this extracted a five-
dollar bill he put the lamp on the de-
crepit night-tabie and the bill under the
lamp where the girl would be sure to find it
fie blew out the light he picked up his
heavy suit-case and made his way silently
out into the hall he hated to leave like
this he would have liked to say good-by
but what was the use his conscience was
c lear the five would cover everything

   he was half-way down the stairs on his
way to the front door moving with al the
caution he could master when a sound of


all-story weekly

movement and voices made him halt and
hold his breath

  the colonel and the girl were down there
he had believed them to be in their rooms
possibly asleep they hadnt even come up-
stairs at least the colonel hadnt from
the girls first words it was evident that she
had been looking for the colonel had just
found him

   you mustnt stay there in the dark
she said gently  come now jo to bed
-and sleep to-morrow you will be feeling
better

  the colonels response was an indistinct
murmur

  alvah was carrying a lamp she and the
colonel appeared from the back parlor
they paused at the foot of the opposite
flight of the double stairway they were so
close that davies did not dare to move one
way or the other at least he va in com-
parative darkness as for alvah and her
uncle they had the light of the lamp in their
eyes

   i am overwhelmed the colonel con-
fessed

  he looked it he was flabby shriveled
would be the better word ten years had
been added to his age he was a man not
yet recovered from a deadly sickness ilis
voice hail that sort of feebleness about it
that betokens a lack of breath

   you shouldnt be overwhelmed al-
vah chided as she might have spoken to a
misguided child

  alvah

   yes uncle dear

   i must tell you

   what

   i tried to keep it from you

  alvah put down her lamp on one of the
upper steps

   you mean about there being no more
money left she demanded softly she
even tried to put a playful note into the
words she put out her two hands and took
her uncles hands in hers   know 
knew it the moment i saw the sian you put
out i was merely a little slow to believe

    it is all gone

   i can work earn enough for both of
us

   the drink was my ruination

    and then alvah hurried on still with
that assumption of consoling lightness-
 and then i he sign did serve a good pur-
pose

    muddled on expecting the lightning
somehow to strike

   and didnt it alvah drew her uncle
down to a place on the steps she seated
herself at his feet she smiled up into his
face wistfully  what better good fortune
could have befallen us than to have mr
davies come when he did well put out
the sign again

  the old man awoke from his depression
 mr davies god bless the boy
davies standing on the steps across the
ha felt a little creep of goose-flesh on his
body it was as if some one had tickled
him he cursed himself -without the use
of words fsr being where he was he
virtid in -ptak but he couldnt speak it
was impossible for him to move

   could we want a better lodger

    he was a friend to me he was a son
but now hell be leaving us it is only right
that he should it is what i should advise
him to do he was a son to me and i have
driven him away

   nonsense do you think that hes the
sort who runs away

    no hes as brave as a lion

   what then

    he is a gentleman i have disgraced
him

   he knows youre sorry theres no
disgrace fight on isnt that the motto
youve been following all these years youve
been here in st clair trying to settle up
uncle abners estate havent you told
me that that was what the welsh-what the
cymry-did under rhodri mawr-and
what stonewall jackson did during the
seven days dont you suppose-dont
you suppose she demanded while her
voice fell to little more than a thrilling
whisper  that theres a higher power that
knows all about your needs who can tell
but that it was that higher power who sent
mr davies here

  davies heard all this and he had the
time to meditate it too for there was a
long silence and in this the girls words re-
echoed
if you believe it its so



  	 aye he came as one sent by the
lord to-night i stood at armageddon
and it was as if i had been among the spirits
of devils and they were gathered to the bat-
tle of god almighty his day and rich-
ard came to me alvah-came to me like one
of the seven angels bearing the vials of the
wrath of god

  the colonel was running into a mystic
mood

   he taught them a lesson said alvah
 it was a lesson they needed it was a
lesson that theyll never forget

   god moves in a mysterious way i
little thought when i saw mr davies
this morning that-no i did know it
something told me the moment that i saw
his face that here was a friend that here
was some one destined to play a part in the
lives perhaps of both of us what is that
the good book says  be not forgetful to
entertain strangers -it all comes back to
me- for thereby some have entertained
angels unawares 

  again the silence settled down again
davies found himself as in a state of sus-
pended animation he felt as a spirit might
feel when hovering over the dead body that
had belonged to it during the earthly in-
carnation

  there was one choked voice speaking
from the silence  they got me wrong
but there was another voice small and
clear  why not

  why not be the thing they were believing
him to be it was as if he stood on the
edge of a measureless gulf and contemplated
the possibility of flight

   did you notice the girl asked  how
they were all afraid to move or speak as
we went away it was a mere whisper
a question not calling for an answer  they
were afraid

  the colonel had dropped his head forward
and rested it in his hands the girl did not
disturb his reflection she sat motionless
and looked off into the shadows the lamp-
light shone down on the two of them and
made a picture that slowly burned itself into
richard daviess memory what was he
that he should be treated to a picture like
this what right had he to look at it

  he stood there flattened against the wall

   	a-s

and he was like some one or some thing that
has been annihilated

  who was this they had talked about
it couldnt be himself although they had
used his name and this no mere sobriquet
of the streets either but the name his
father had borne before him

  he looked back on his immediate past
but the one big fact that stuck out of it-
like a peak from a cloud-was the girls
hand on his arm she had shown then the
sort of faith that she had in him it wasnt
the old chick whose arm she had taken
it was the arm of some one named mr
richard davies yet who was this mr
richard davies

 me

   no it aint you

    but it will be

  for as yet he was still annihilated in
every respect except that of his fluttering
disrupted thought his mouth was open

  then the colonel straightened up he
spoke to the girl but he did not look at
her he also peered off into the shadows

   alvah you are right altogether right
but most right in keeping your faith in the
power that sent us this friend in need the
lord was watching over me even while i
was writing that card it was he who
brought mr davies to our door

  the girl put out her hand and caressed his
face as the colonel slowly turned his head
and looked at her davies coukl see the
grief and contrition in the old mans eyes
it recalled the look he had seen in the face
of old ezra wood and it summoned to his
own heart the same vague hunger-the
same white awe-thai had been there that
night in the boone house

   alvah the colonel cd  lets you and
me-get down on our knees-here and now
-and thank him for sending us such a
friend and gentleman-as mr davies

chapter xx

partners

a vies fled

  he went up the stairs taking his
suit-case with him -but he went like
a ghost making no more noise than a shad-
all-story weekly



ow perhaps he wouldnt have cared so
very much if he had made a noise there
are crises in the lives of every one when
the ordinary conventions-and even the or-
dinary decencies so called-count for noth-
ing and this was one of them

  he reached the room he had deserted
only a few minutes before me went in
he closed the door behind him i dropped
his suit-case on the floor he wilted back
against the door and stood there mentally
haggard if not physically haggard and
stared unseeingly into the gloom

  but he was not altogether bereft of vision

  only what he saw was the series of pic-
tures he had brought back with him from
the hall chiefly the last picture of all
wherein an old man and a young girl were
kneeling side by side humbly thanking god
for sending them such a friend as mr rich-
ard davies

  by and by davies recovered possession
of himself to such an extent that he picked
up his suit-case and thrust it back into the
place from which he had taken it he
relighted the lamp several times he paced
the length of the room he stepped over to
the door finally and opened it wide it
was not long before the thing happened
which he had expected

  there was a knock at the side of the door
and there was the voice of colonel wil-
liams asking him if he had not yet retired

   come in davies invited

  the colonel came in he said something
about the possible desirability of extra cov-
ers for the bed the unseasonable coolness
of the nights davies smiled upon him
thrust forward the single chair in the room
which was near the bed he held the chair
while the colonel eased his weight into it
then davies seated himself on the bed

   the covers and everything are ail right
colonel but im glad you came i was
wanting to talk to you

  for the first time since the colonel had
entered the room their eyes met and held

   richard i have come to apologize

   no apologies are needed-not from
you

   as one gentleman to another-

   wait a minute colonel

  davies was still smiling but there was a

whiteness in his smile as he himself could
feel what he could not feel perhaps was
how deeply brilliant his dark eyes burned
in the yellow twilight made by the little
lamp the colonel looking at him must
have had a vision of mystic warriors on
welsh battle-fields hut the colonel waited

   ive got to tell you something davies
went on  my parents were all right i
believe they were i know they were see
but ive spent most of my life among graft-
ers and thieves he lurched out the rest of
it hurriedly  i was one myself

  the old colonel wasnt looking at him any
longer he hadnt shifted his eyes precise-
ly it was rather a change of focus the
colonel was looking mistily through him
and beyond him his old face-misty eyes
droopy nose white and monumental mus-
tache- had become a portrait of earthly
wisdom it was a very human face humor-
ous and sad the colonel had made a slight
gesture with his hand otherwise he did
not express himself but davies was find-
ing it easier to go on than he may have
expected

   it was the easy money that made it
seem so good to me he said  easy
money even when i was a little shaver and
could swipe a tool or something from a new
building or a sidewalk where i was sup-
posed to be collecting firewood a trip to
john the junkman and there you were
and there were two or three times when i
thought that  was going straight but it
was easy money that always switched me
back-in a phony gambling-house-where
i put down a ten and saw it turn into fifty
and  left the fifty and saw it run to a
thousand but i never went back i was
always too wise for that i would never
get caught and it was like that when i
brushed up against a young swell in the
polo grounds and almost everything he
had dropped right out of his pocket into
mine easy money easy money

  the colonel nodded his head slowly sev-
eral times and at the end of a nod with
his head lowered he kept it that way and
remained motionless

    until at iasi said davies  i did take
a tumble to what it all meant and what it
was all leading to
if you believe it its so



   you never get anything for nothing
youve got to pay the price for every-
thing you get i saw it right  saw it
whole

   and if i didnt want to pay the price
like all the other thieves and grafters-or
almost all-it was me for the country
where i could work it out-something of
what i owed-or all of it even-square
myself altogether-you understand-out
here in the country where the decent peo-
ple live and you dont have to lock your
doors at night and where every other per-
son that you meet aint a grafter or a
crook

   i understand the colonel murmured
and he slowly tugged at his silvery mus-
tache as a preliminary to further expres-
sion of his own  i understand

     i wanted to tell you this davies con-
tinued his voice going smaller  i may
be sticking around here for a while you
know just to see how things turn ort but
i couldnt do it and let you folks go on
believing that i was something that i
aint

  his diminishing voice came to a rather
abrupt pause as if he had suddenly dis-
covered that he had said everything that
he had to say

  the colonel was looking at him again-
out of the top of his eyes

   i understand richard the colonel
announced  ive known all along what
you were what youve been telling me
has merely confirmed my first judgment of
you

   you knew-

  the colonel slowly reached for some-
thing that made a weight in the tail-pocket
of his coat it was something that did not
come easily it required considerable time
and effort to extract it when it did come
it revealed itself as the colonels flask
there was still a finger or so of whisky in
it the colonel held the flask up where it
would catch the light he slowly rocked
the liquor back and forth

  there for an interval davies may have
been expecting the colonel to pull the cork
invite him again to take a drink there
would have been nothing surprising about
such an action in the world davies came

from this was the usual climax to an emo-
tional passage

  but the colonel still with the flask in
his hand got thoughtfully to his feet

   -knew that you were sent he mur-
mured

  he trudged over to one of the shuttered
windows opening on the garden he
pushed a shutter open

  davies watching him saw the colonel
uncork the flask and empty its contents
into the outer darkness he saw the old
man remain there apparently absorbed in
thought for yet a moment or so longer
then toss the flask away

  a midnight funeral

  the flask fell into a bed of pansies that
alvah morley had been cultivating down
there ever since her advent in the old house
the pansies grew lush and were generous
with their flowers-purple and soft and
faintly fragrant there can be no earthly
record of what the pansies thought when
the bottle arrived among them but they
accepted it without protest received it ten-
derly-gladly one would be tempted to be-
lieve-the expiatory sacrifice of some frag-
ile human flower

  pansies for thoughts

  the colonel remained for a rather long
time at the window letting the breeze of
the night blow in upon him it stirred his
white mustache and the folds of his coat

  when he turned there was a different
look in his face his expression conveyed
an appearance of enlightenment of added
wisdom-a wisdom no less human than
was habitual to him but not quite so ter-
restrial perhaps he smiled gently at the
youth who was watching him

  he put out his hand

  wondering a little yet touched with un-
derstanding thrilled not a little with some
quiver of relief that was almost joy rich-
ard davies got up and seized the colonels
hand

  my boy said the colonel my boy-

   i was afraid-

   a man need never fear anv one but
himself

   i couldnt let you believe-

   a man is not hurt by lies sir but by
the truth and the truth wont hurt him


am-story weekly

when hes right gotl bless vou anti good
night

chapter xxl

 welcome to  k city

there may have been something in
that aphorism of the colonel  about
the truth being salutary so lung as a
man was right

  the news of what had happened at the
hotel the night before had spread this
news alone would have been enough to
make davies a person of note in st clair
-one to be considered and looked up to
especially by the ladies of the town and
far from being hurt by the inevitable un-
truths stitched onto the fabric of fact these
added details merely increased his renown

  but davies wasnt caring very much
what people said either one way or the
other  a man is injured not by lies sir
but by the truth and the truth wont
hurt him when hes right that was good
enough for him and he prepared to set
forth on his days work

  so did mrs meckley

  mrs meckley had gone to bed late and
had risen early she had done this with
a pleasant consciousness of duty some
one had to keep st clair posted as to the
doings across the street it was barely
nine oclock when she sallied forth she
had already caught a distant glimpse of her
neighbor mrs sanders troweling bulbs in
her front yard a hundred yards farther on
toward the center of town

   i just saw that young man mrs
meckley began

   who the jne that kicked up the
rumpus last night at the hotel mrs
sanders turned to the black earth and
scooped out another bulb

   what say

   thought everybody in town knew
about it by this time

   i just saw him saying good-by mrs
meckley persisted weakly

   better say good-by  reckon hes about
done his share

   you mean flirting-

 serves em right guzzlin an smokin

  mrs meckley thought she saw a lead
she dropped her voice narrowed her eyes

   there was a light in his window till
after midnight she tempted

  hut mrs sanders hadnt wasted all her
ammunition not by a jugful she gathered
up her bulbs in a small box made a strain-
ing effort and got to her feet

   im talkin about deacon crane and
county commissioner miller gettin their
faces smacked and that little squirt of an
ed hall-i should think his mother would
go out with a new silk dress on every week
-gettin his lip split not to speak of the
riffraff that usually does hang around the
saloon all gettin a tannin

   milly sanders 

  l learn em a lesson they ought to a
knowed he was the colonels adopted son

  it wasnt long before mrs meckley dis-
covered that she was in a hurry-that she
was already late in fact - on an errand
that would take her further on her way
even so she wasnt quick enough she
saw that she was behind her schedule the
moment her eyes lit on the faces of the
beverly sisters they also had the news

  only this time mrs meckley wasnt
unprepared she whispered something into
the somewhat wilted ears of the sisters

   but he hasnt ever been married said
the elder miss beverly

   thats what im telling you said mrs
meckley and she whispered again  and
i think its just scandalous the old repro-
bate aiming to marry off the girl like this
to his own son well good-by both of
you i got to be trotting along

  she trotted and the beverly sisters de-
cided that they would go out in the back
garden to see whether mrs mintner was
still at her curtain frames

    i dont see why she persists in calling
the judge a reprobate said the younger
miss beverly with a touch of malice

   xo said the elder with perfect under-
standing  shes been setting her cap for
colonel williams long enough goodness
knows 

    and he never would look at her said
the younger miss beverly pinking up

  meantime mr richard davies with that
aphorism of the colonels in mind and o i-
if you believe it its so



scious that he had come off first best in the
proceedings of the night before whatever
might be said about it started out to see
what sort of an impression he could make
on the town as a soap-agent he remem-
bered the instructions that had been handed
to him on a printed card at the soap-head-
quarters in greenwich street

work every house

if they look poor remember the poor are easy

if they look rich tell them so and theyll fall

  he had his suit-case with the half-hun-
dred cakes in it also a deck of business-
cards his first try was the house right
across the street-a little house back of a
high hedge but no one was home and he
had to leave a card

  the next house he tried was up the street
where a woman was digging bulbs

   good morning he said  harvesting
your onions

  the woman looked up from her work
recognized him as the towns latest arrival
she smiled as she said  these were early
tulips

   know you dont need it he said amia-
bly  but im introducing the new saporino
line of mexican mystery soaps the name
sounds rather bunk but they really are
good soaps use them myself

  he gave mrs sanders the help of his
hand she was old enough to compliment
him frankly

   youre a good advertisement

  any one would have been justified in say-
ing as much he was clean immaculate
even though he was a little shabby

  well you see he confessed  i love
this soap so much i feel as if i was doing
folks a favor by letting them have it-
twenty-five a cake and better than a novel
or a play

   he aint the bruiser they were makin
him out to be said mrs sanders looking
after him

  he had made the sale

  he could have cleaned out his entire stock
to the beverley sisters he knew that he
could the moment that they pounced upon
him with their eyes it was evident that
he had been well advertised the ruction
at the hotel had been a good thing after all

  the elder of the two addressed him from
the porch

   good morning mr williams

   whats that

   arent you colonel williamss-er-
  davies got a portion of her meaning

   xo relation he smiled  i wish i
was im introducing the saporino line-
and he recited his familiar patter

   isnt it rather expensive

   use ordinary soap to get the rough dirt
off although we recommend our customers
to use the saporino line exclusively ah go
on and take a dozen cakes two bits per
i could tell right away that you ladies
had been to xew york and knew all about
the saporino line-

  with mrs meckley as an advance agent
his fame was reaching into quarters where
it hadnt readied before but davies was
cautious it was almost too good to be true
this glad-hand welcome he was getting
wherever he went he scented something
in the air xor was he very long in finding
out that he was right and what the danger
was

  he had just sold his last cake of soap
when he saw a familiar figure sauntering
along the maple-shaded street it was that
tough young farmer who had threatened to
give gus a wallop on his own account the
night before

  davies was glad to see him he was tired
of talking to women he strolled up to
meet him

   hello he said

   hello and the young farmer with a
shrewd glance backed up to lean against
the fence

   come and have a cigar with me
davies invited

   dont care if i do

  there was a small cigar and candy store
across the street

   give us a couple of your best cigars
said davies to the alert but unshaven young
merchant behind the counter

   xickel straight said the merchant
taking two cigars from a box in the glass
case

  and his eyes were as keen as a hawks
until he had his dime

 here comes the bus for pleasantville


all-story wkkkly

he farmer remarked softly and casually
when they were outside again

    let her come said davies only mildly
interested  i guess this town will hold
me for a while

   the other snorted softly

    it  hold you longer n you think if
you dont watch out

   on account of what happened at the
hotel

   thats what started it hut nobody
wants nothing done about that for fear of
gettin drug into court themselves like miss
morley said but theyve got the constable
primed up to run you in for sell in without
a license

  he shot a swift glance up the street
toward the center of town his voice
speeded up a notch

   and here he comes now

chapter xxii

justice thats ail

his first instinct was to run away
without looking particularly he could
see that his chances for flight were
good the street was loosely gardened to
left and right the open country at no
place was far away-meadows flowing corn-
fields patches of wood his suit-case was
empty there would be no great loss if he
abandoned it he had always hated the
prospect of jail now with a splurge of
feeling he knew that he was hating it more
than ever-even though it should mean but
a day or two-on such a feeble charge as
peddling soap without a license

  his mind was working fast

  the constable moreover was taking his
time

  davies flashtngly reviewed his previous
life the change that had come into it-and
that change particularly which he had ex-
perienced since his arrival at flowery har-
bor

   it helped him to check his instinct to run
it helped him to check that other instinct
which was to bluff-plav the indignant as-
sume the role of injured innocence threaten
reprisals in a political way that was sol-
lys way

   what are you going to do about it
the young farmer asked

   square myself davies replied  so
long thanks 

  davies met the constable at the side of
a low fence fringing a garden beyond
the garden was a lane there was another
lane just across the way and this ran off
down a slope between other garden fences
to a willowv hollow there was still a
good chance to get away but all the
time davies was getting a better grip on
himself

  he and the man of the law surveyed each
other

  the constable was a man of middle age-
a trifle fat a trifle dirty but keen-eyed and
efficient he was chewing tobacco he
slowly masticated he spat to one side
his eyes came back to daviess eyes

    reckon he said without other pre-
liminaries  you know who i am

   youre the constable

  the other squinted down at a nickel-
plated badge on the lapel of his coat he
burnished it with his sleeve

   and youre the young feller he said
as if announcing a happy surprise  whos
been scllin inside the corporate limits with-
out a license i guess ill have to ask you
to step along with me

  im ready

   you seem to take it sort of cool

  why shouldnt i i havent been do-
ing anything wrong i didnt know  had to
have a license

   ignorance of the law aint no defense
the constable recited

   im willing to get a license

   i suppose so said the constable with a
flash of malice  now that the crime has
been committed

  the constable was still leisurely there
was an air about him of preoccupation of
not having said all that he had to say and
davies noticed this

   what do you think id better do about
it

   thats for the squire to say although
he do generally follow my recommend

   and whats that

   the lock-up he snapped out the
words  it largely depends on what i say
if you believe it its so



-and on what you might call public senti-
ment

  with no chance to get off with a
fine

  the constable slanted a meaning look at
davies he casually glanced up and down
the all but deserted street

   xow youre beginning to say some-
thin he mused

  again he shot a look at davies

   well come along he said  well
be gettin off to the lock-up

   have a cigar said davies

   dont mind if i do

   he took the cigar that the prisoner offered
and bit the end from it davies held a
match for him

   do you mean that i might get off all
right with a fine

   how much money you got

  i dont know but it ought to be
enough

  the constable lowered his voice spoke a
little more quickly than he had spoken
hitherto

    i aint one of these here officers that
wont listen to reason he averred with a
touch of nervous eagerness im broad-
minded enough if it comes to that got to
be b heck i got a family he wasnt
altogether hardened he appeared to be a
little disconcerted he ran on with a trace
of nervous laughter  some folks went
through here just the other day bustin the
speed-limits in one of these here big purple
cars and theyd been goin on like that yet
if i hadnt nabbed them and the feller who
was steerin he says to me just like that
says he be you one of these here officers
that wont listen to reason  how so
says i  why says he  if you aint says
he  mebbe youll let me pay the fine right
here and now says he

   how much was the fine davies in-
quired

    in his particular case it was a five-
dollar bill

   cant i pay my fine right here

   not right here the constable whis-
pered  unless youre mighty keerful about
it

   ill be careful

  davies was as good as his word he cast
a cautious look about him he turned his
face to the fence and deftiy drew his bill-
fold he counted out five one-dollar bills
but the constable was not so cautious at
any rate the sight of the strangers money
seemed to interest him more than any
chance of some one discovering his method
of executing the law his keen eyes counted
the five bills as davies counted them and
also took note of all the other money inthe
fold

   i reckon he breathed  that your fine
will be just twice that much

   you ought to go to some bigger town
said davies briefly after the transfer had
been made but he kept his temper  how
do i know that they wont make trouble
for me when i go to get my license even
now

  the constable was in high good humor

   i guess you neednt worry about that
he said  just let on like nothins hap-
pened keep your mouth shut and nothins

a shorty kilgour story

you didnt know that  am an actor
did you not many people know it
and among those who do the excite-
ment isnt violent at present of course i
am not engaged in treading the boards my
duties call for strict attention to about
seven square miles of alfalfa land besides
which i do a little light livery stable work
run the ranch tractors and perform miscel-
laneous erands for old man treadwell

  jim caldwell likewise is an actor some
people out here admit that he is a mighty
bad actor when he winds up on too much
of joe ilynns hand-made rum bui what i
mean is that both jim and me have quali-
fied on the dramatic stage we may never
see our names in electric lights over a thea-
ter entrance but we have both fell the thrill
of die descending curtain and the scattered
applause

  all of this happened a long time ago be-
fore pop treadwell captured us and har-
nessed us up to his rolling ranch now we
are plain unvarnished hired hands doing
our best to keep the cattle in shape but
once we were more or less famous and it
happened because jim could drive four
horses

  we had been fooling around springer
idaho waiting for a job with a medicine
outfit but something happened to the show
and it began to look like jim and me would

have to move out of our boarding house or
pay the woman one afternoon we wan-
dered disconsolately out of town and
stopped on the brow of a long hill to medi-
tate and figure on the immediate future
off in the distance we could see a cloud of
dust and when it came nearer we observed
wagons and figures

  the lead wagon had three cross seats
and on these sat eight or nine sad-looking
individuals including a gent wearing a
clean collar and a silk hat behind the
first wagon came a vehicle laden with
trunks that was the entire parade the
man driving the baggage wagon was having
trouble with his horses he had four of
them and when the caravan reached our
hill the baggage wagon slid into a gully and
a few of the trunks dropped overboard

   what would you say that is jim
asked me

   looks like a theatrical troupe i re-
turned - they have a lean and unfed look
about ihem that makes me think of actors

  and it was too it was matchs all-star
cast arriving in springer to regale the pop-
ulace with the spoken drama at least they
expected to arrive in springer if they could
get their baggage wagon out of the chuck-
hole

  mr hatch was the gent with the slightly
-oiled silk hat and about the time the

 
ox axd off



unfortunate driver spilled the trunks into
the road mr hatch hurst into as flowery a
flood of profane language as  have ever
heard there were some ladies present but
apparently they were accustomed to high-
powered words

  jim and i wandered over to the trunk
wagon and helped the big swede load up the
derailed baggage and during the operation
mr hatch took off his lid and reproached
his driver finally he turned on jim

   can you drive four horses he asked

   yes said jim

   do you want to drive them

   sure

   get up there then hatch said
 youre elected

  li what about my friend jim asked

   does he want a job hatch inquired
  jim nodded

   all right said hatch looking at me
 you dont look like a very brilliant person
maybe i can make an actor out of you

  so i climbed up beside jim and while
neither of us knew it at the moment that
began our dramatic career we then and
there joined hatchs all-star cast that
night we watched the company playing
 east lynn  in the springer opera house
sitting down in front on free seats

   well said jim at the end of the sec-
ond act  i never tried it but if thats act-
ing i can act

   me too i agreed  right now im a
better actor than half of this company and
i never tried it

  the leading man was tall and wore a
mustache the leading lady was a dame of
uncertain years named hazel hammond
and the main thing about hazel was her
diamonds she had about half a quart of
jewels and joe marmon one of the actors
told us they were real diamonds later on
another member of the company adopted
them and left on a freight train so i sup-
pose they had some value

  joe marmon was a nice quiet guy with
a bald spot he was the company genius
and had once written a play called  on the
border other members of the company
informed me that joe had stolen this work
of art from an old-time play anyhow
whether he wrote it or just rewrote it old

man hatch produced it now and then with
the full company there seemed to be a
demand for  on the border and when-
ever the call was loud and clear boss hatch
put it on

   but in the past the play had always sort
of fallen down it got so that hatch
swore he would never present it again and
the reason was that the play depended for
its big smash upon the dynamite explosion
at the end of the second act that explo-
sion had been turning out a fizzle and
hatch got tired of it he always advertised
a good explosion and the people came ex-
pecting a good explosion and they never
got it

  about ten days after jim and i joined
the all-star cast the company headed
north into the robbers roost county this
is a long fertile valley between some saw-
toothed mountains and as the railroads
dont run up there the towns inthe rob-
bers roost territory rarely get to see a show
with regular actors there is only one way
into the valley and thats the way we went
over a rocky rutty trail with jim and me
driving the baggage wagon and the rest of
the cast coming behind

   it took us two days to get to five falls
and when we arrived we found that the
town consisted of a solitary hotel and one
other building which was part livery stable
and part theatre we got into five falls
about dusk and looked about for signs of a
town

   where is the place hatch asked the
hotel owner in some astonishment

    right here said the man  this is
five falls

     dont sec any town hatch went on
grieved  ware supposed to give a show
here to-night if this is the place where
are all the people

   	oh theyll be in all right the man
answered  theyve got to tend to their
milking if i was you mister i wouldnt
begin my show till nine or ten oclock

   so hatch followed the hotel mans sug-
gestion we postponed the opening hour
until ten oclock and when the curtain went
up there were three hundred people in the
house they came from points twenty
miles off and right after supper we began to


all-story weekly

see the lanterns on the end of wagon poles
as they crept into town through the dark-
ness

  in the course of our dramatic wanderings
through a sterile and barbarous country we
came upon the town of huttersville and i
wish to state at this juncture that  will
never forget huttersville or mr hutter the
dumpy little man with the chin whisker
after whom the town was named

   huttersville is a little burg buried behind
some raw and rocky mountains and the
mail comes in once a week from the civil-
ized outside world old man hutter owns
the town it is his own private and per-
sonal village he began it reared it tenderly
and now guards it with a parents stern love
to guard it right he carries a couple of
guns on his hips and when our little theatri-
cal troupe reached town we immediately
began to hear horrendous tales about what
a rough guy old hutter was

  up to this time in our join and several
careers with the company neither jim nor i
had drawn down any money the cere-
monial of pay-day was unknown in hatchs
all-star cast it was a custom among the
actors to go wiihout salary and be content
with having their board and lodging paid
and while this struck us as a novelty still
jim and i didnt want to break any estab-
lished customs so we said nothing we
were eating pretty regularly anti had no de-
sire to trifle with our luck

  jims salary was ten dollars a week and
mine was nine dollars each seven days only
jim never got his and neither did i

  furthermore neither one of us had yet
done any real acting on the stage among
scenery and surroundings i did all my act-
ing in the barn with the horses and jim
acted with the baggage and scenes when
we complained to hatch that we were hired
to act a little he said to wait till he pro-
duced  on the border in which we would
be sure to find a couple of toothsome parts
so we waited patiently

ii

  in huttersville hatchs all-star cast
busted loose with  orphan annie  before
a full and enthusiastic audience old man

hutter inspected the performance just like
he inspected every performance standing in
front in a belligerent attitude before the
cutain went up the old coyote made a
speech to the audience advising decorum
and calm he swore profusely during this
speech but no ladies walked out on him
he threatened to climb up in the gallery
and kill a mess of small boys if they yelled
or pounded with their feet then he waved
a kaiserlike hand and told the show to go
on and it went

  hutter was a small fattish man with a
bald head and a red nose it was his cus-
tom to observe each and every performance
given in the theater from the center of the
stage at the point where the middle aisles
runs into the footlights

   i noticed this strange habit of his at once
he used to watch the performance standing
witli his elbows resting on the stage and his
chin in his palms staring up at the actors
if they said something he didnt like he
stopped the show and balled out the un-
lucky guy before everybody and if he
didnt like the drama he stopped every-
thing put out the lights and told the audi-
ence to go home he was one little auto-
crat this little hutter guy and as i said
he carried a couple of guns on his hip to
give his remarks the proper emphasis

  along about this time jim and i began
to feel that hatch wasnt going to let us act
at all we stood there in the alley back of
hutters opera house one night early that
week discussing hatch and his persecution
of us

   he aint never going to let us act and
thats plain jim said to me  were just
good enough for the rough work around
here

   he said he would give us a couple of
swell parts when he put on  on the bor-
der  i argued  why dont he put it on

   yeah why dont he demanded joe
marmon the author of the play in question
 it aint doing the right thing by me
either i wrote that play and its a bird
hes doing me an injustice and the people
all want to see  on the border too even
old man hutter asked hatch why he didnt
put it on

  -	well why dont he i demanded
ox and off

s

   because hatch says the explosion in the
old mill at the end of the second act always
turns out rotten joe explained and thats
the first jim and i knew there was an ex-
plosion in the piece  hatch says that ex-
plosion is always a fizzle and spoils the
piece

  at that moment the sole proprietor of
hatchs all-star cast came suddenly out of
the stage entrance and busted into our con-
fab

   well mr hatch demanded having
heard the final part of joes speech
 wasnt that explosion a frost the last
town we played it am  right or wrong
is there any good playing  on the border 
with an explosion that sounds like a robin
laying an egg aint that explosion the
main thing in the show thats why i
wont put the thing on in this town or any
other even if old man hutter demands it

   say mr hatch jim said suddenly
 you mean that you would put this play
on and give me and shorty a chance to act
if you only had a good explosion

   sure said hatch and then being in a
hurry he walked away

  jim watched him go down the alley and
turn into the street and then turned to me

   shorty he said  you been eager to
do a little acting and now your time has
come likewise i have yearned to get up
there and show these birds some real acting
and i am about to have my fling

   he said he wouldnt produce  on the
border  till he was sure of a first-class ex-
plosion joe marmon said glumly

   and hes going to have a first-class ex-
plosion jim returned  have you got the
manuscript sos the company can learn this
piece

  joe said he had it up in his trunk at the
hotel and jim told him to dig it out and
have copies made for all members of the
cast

   and have a couple for me and shorty
jim added  because this is our first oppor-
tunity

  when we were alone a little later on i in-
quired what all this meant

   you heard what hatch said didnt
you jim demanded

   sure that we have to have a real ex-

plosion instead of the usual fizzers whats
that got to do with it

   well jim went on with a proud and
thoughtful smile  you dont know it be-
cause we werent acquainted then but im
one of the best little explosion experts in the
world back in my home town in the old
days i used to be the fourth of july king
i got up all the home-made cannons and
mortars they used lo depend on me to
produce a lot of loud noise and i made
good what i dont know about explosions
noise and excitement aint worth knowing
so when i heard that there was nothing be-
tween us and a chance to act but a good ex-
plosion i knew our chance had come

   you mean youre going to undertake to
make the explosion  asked

   at the end of the second act of  on
the border  jim went on  there has got
to be a good loud explosion in the old mill
-one that will convince die audience and
up to this time the company has been shy
one high-class explosion expert if id only
known why hatch was backward we would
have acted long ago

   well i said somewhat pleased  i
didnt know you were a gunpowder shark
but that aint important anyhow the
main thing is that he puts on the show
and then we get our long and patiently
waited opportunity

   we do said jim  and we wont
have to wait long

  and we didnt either

  jim and joe marmon got together and
then held a consultation with boss hatch
joe probably explained that jim caldwell
was the man the company had long needed
and when hatch was assured that jim knew
all the technical details about a good bang-
up explosion he consented to have the thing
announced

  old man hutter was informed officially
that  on the border  would be performed
in new york style by the hatch all-
star organization on friday night and the
old coyote was pleased he wrote out the
announcement on the back of a playing
card which he nailed to the pole in front of
the huttersvill barber shop and the towns
folk began to talk about the thrilling melo-
drama


all-story weekly

  jim came to me with pride glowing in his
eyes and brought the news

   im to play the part of the hero he
said  and youre the villain you annoy
me all through and at the end of ihe second
act you hit me on the head with the gun and
tie me up to the burning powder keg

   it sounds reasonable i remarked
 what do i say first right after the curtain
goes up

  we didnt have all the time in ihe world
to study our respective parts of hero and
villain because friday night was approach-
ing fast but we went to work and i learned
what i had to do without any trouble

  meantime jim and joe marmon were
busy learning their own lines but what
was more important they were out rustling
a class one explosion to insert at the end of
the second act and thus make good with
manager hatch they had promised him
and they were doing their best

  i didnt know what steps jim was taking
and if i had known my own part in  on
the border  would have been different

   to begin the explosion was to take place
in the old mill the hero was called upon
to be tied up to the burning powder keg by
the scheming villain and just before the
mill blew up the beautiful heroine was to
dash in and unloose the heros bonds then
the mill went up and thats what had
always proved a failure in the past they
couldnt get the mill to go up with the
proper amount of authority the audience
simply snickered at the explosion scene id
told each other it was a cheesy exhibition
it was this that jim was attempting to over-
come using as he said his fourth of july
experience of olden days

  i have always known that jim was a
nut but i did not know joe marmon well
enough to catalogue him he was not only
a nut but he was a simple-minded cred-
ulous childish durned fool he went
along with jim caldwell while that wild-
haired hyena prepared the explosion mate-
rial and about these details i knew nothing
until later on

   the first thing they did was to buy eight
or nine pounds of very black gunpowder
which they packed into a defunct lard-can
they then prowled around huttersville

until they discovered a beer-keg it was
an old-fashioned solid oak beer-keg that
had never known a weak moment in its life
thus equipped jim and joe wandered back
to mutters opera-house with their mate-
rial they put the top on the lard-can and
made a neat hole in it then they placed
the can carefully in the bottom of the beer-
keg and began packing it in they used
pieces of wet paper bits of wood small
rocks sand gravel mud some petrified
turnips jim found back of a grocery and
various other ingredients when they got
through packing the lard-can was tightly
wedged inside the beer-keg they then ran
the fuse up through the top and nailed the
top back onto the beer-keg after which jim
announced that they were now ready for
a good thrilling explosion in the mill scene

  and they were believe me that ex-
plosion scene never had a chance of turning
out a fizzle after those two maniacs fin-
ished up their preparations

   shorty jim explained to me that fri-
day afternoon l were going to have one
peach of a blow-up old man flutter will
be surprised and hatch will be pleased
this aint going to be no fizzle and dont
you forget it

  as stated i didnt know the details of
mr caldwells preparations i only knew
that he seemed mighty sure the explosion
would thrill the huttersville audience
nothing happened until about six oclock
that evening jim passed me in a hurry
going into the dressing-room and paused

   shorty he said  i forgot to get a
fuse you rush out somewhere and buy a
good fuse we cant get along without a
fuse

  so i put on my hat and started out on
a still hunt through huttersville to find a
fuse

  i got into all the stores uiat were still
open but no fuses business had been
very quiet in the fuse line they told me
but finally  got a guy in a hardware-store
to patch up a home-made fuse and while
it wasnt a very workmanlike object still it
would burn with surprising speed he used
paper and string and powder and what
else i dont know i took the fuse back
to jim and he thanked me
on and oii



   later on i was sorry i bought that fuse

   then the people of huttersville began to
move toward the hutter opera-house to
witness the performance of that sterling
melodrama  on the border by joseph
marmon presented by lemuel hatch and
his all-star cast the town was filled with
suppressed excitement joe marmon was
trotting around in circles and every one
else was more or less fidgety i didnt know
whether i knew my lines or not

   shorty jim said to me fixing his
make-up on  this is going to be a big night
in our lives

    i believe it i said

iii

  so it came about that the house was
crowded the night jim and i began our
artistic career every seat in the gallery
was occupied by a palpitant gent all ready
to be thrilled there was not a soul in the
building that hadnt come to be there when
that old mill blew up

  old man hutter appeared toward the
start of the show and assumed his dicta-
torial manner and his impudent position
down there at the foot of the center aisle
where it runs into the footlights the
theater was heated in the good old-style
way with a pot-bellied coal-stove which
was going pretty good that night it being
a mite chilly outside it was one of the
roundest reddest and fattest stove i can
remember and it is impressed upon my
mind forever

   on the opposite side of the theater and
near the stage was a piano that opened up
the back that piano was a priceless in-
stitution and the proud boast of hutter-
viile because it was the only instrument of
harmony in town it had been hauled into
huttersville on a wagon at a tremendous
outlay of time and money and old man
hutter regarded il with great love and es-
teem it was a highly polished piano and
whenever the man wasnt playing on it
they kept it wrapped up in a mother hub-
bard which the man always threw back
with great ceremony

  the first part of on the border 
found me as nervous as a schoolgirl with

her first young man i not only forgot my
lines i forgot everything i had ever
known including my name and color but
we blundered along somehow jim was
heroing all over the place and  forgot
whether he remembered his lines or invent-
ed stuff as he went along

  joe marmon hadnt been seen during the
first act and i found out later that he had
got himself accidentally stewed toward sup-
ter-time and was therefore detained some-
where but he blew into the theater some
time during the second act he came over
and stood by me just before i hit jim with
the butt end of a gun

  the action was like this jim was the
curly-haired hero and i was trying to ggt
rid of him so i hit him with the gun
dragged his unconscious form into the old
mill tied him to the keg of dynamite and
blew him into smithereens only just be-
fore the explosion the beautiful heroine
came on the run undid him and dragged
him to safety then the piece called for
the explosion

  just before my time to dash out onto
the stage and hammer jim with the gun
joe marmon began talking to me at first
i didnt get the drift of his conversation
but gradually it dawned on me that he was
explaining what a good explosion this ought
to be lie said it ought to satisfy lemuel
hatch old man hutter and all the towns-
people because great pains had been taken
by him and jim to prepare it

   was trying to keep my mind on the
lines i would have to say in a minute so
i only half heard what joe was saying and
anyhow his breath bothered me i had a
lot of tilings to do because after i hit jim
with the gun i tied him up with a rope to
the dynamite and then strung my fuse
across the stage and lighted the far end of
it and about one second lie fore my cue
to leap out came i heard joe talking dis-
tinctly

   yeah joe was saying  they aint a
soul can find fault with this- explosion if
this dont startle them i dont want a dime
theres ten pounds in that tin can any-
how

   ten pounds of what i demanded my
mind turning to joe and his breath


all-story weekly

   gunpowder joe said solemnly
 smoky old-style gunpowder packed in
tight jim and me we hunted high and
low till we got just the can we wanted and
when i say shes going to puff hard  tell
tell the truth when you light that fuse
dont you hang around this theater shorty
the minute you touch her off you start
out through the alley door and keep on
going till its over i wont be here myself
and i know whats going to occur

  there were about nine people on the
stage and it dawned on me that maybe a
catastrophe was at hand i felt a sudden
coolness in the region of my feet and i re-
membered what a liar jim was and also
what a blundering ass

  if joe said they had ten pounds of stuff
packed in that beer-keg there was no rea-
son to doubt it but the news had come too
late

  it was my time to start out and hit jim
with the gun and i did i hit him good
he went down on the stage in a heap and
the audience hissed me then i bound jim
up to the keg and prepared to light the
fuse and if ever there was a job that
looked distasteful that was it but it had
to be done

  i lighted the fuse and then dashed
around the flies telling those not in sight
of the audience to duck out into the alley
then i ran arjund to the handle with
which we let down the curtain because i
knew that the curtain had to come down
fast i found somebodys overcoat and
wrapped it around my head and when 
looked out on the stage the fuse was sput-
tering across the dim light and jim was
struggling like a maniac with hi bonds
the poor nut had enough sense to want to
leave that keg

  before jim got his ropes loose the
heroine ran in and untied him and he
picked her up in his arms and made a wild
run for liberty and the alley door joe
marmon had ducked out and what i had
said had spread a sort of young panic back
on the stage so that nobody was there ex-
cept me and old man hutter with his chin
in his palms and ollie secord ollie was
another member of the all-star cast and in
the explosion scene he was supposed to

stand in the wings holding an armful of
barrel-staves at the right moment ollie
was instructed to toss his barrel-staves up
in the air and let them crash down on the
stage making the noise louder and more
realistic he stood right behind me and
wouldnt duck out into the alley

    youll get killed fool i whispered to
him  this is going to be a bird go on
out

   i got to stay here and throw these
staves ollie answered and im going to
do it

  but he never did because right then
the beer-keg blew up

  and believe me when i say she blew up
right

  by this time i was scared purple with
my coat-collar hiding my shrinking form
from the coming catastrophe i cuddled
against the wall holding the curtain-
handle and the last thing i noticed was
old man hutter standing with his chin in
his palms and his elbows on the stage

  xever in this world was there such an
indoor explosion nowhere in the history
of civilization can you find a record of such
a man-sized bang that barrel rose about
four feet off the floor and let go and it was
just the same as shooting a seventeen-inch
shell through a plate of butter

  ollie secord never did hurl the armful
of barrel-staves onto the stage no the
outburst caught him in the midst of his act
and lifted him into the air when he land-
ed he was blown part way through the side
wall and he was covered with broken bar-
rel-staves and denuded of some skin

  the shock knocked me down before i
could twist the curtain-handle once it
picked profane old man hutter up and
tossed him back against the red-bellied coal-
stove where he seriously burned both arms
before he could crawl off under a seat

   on the stage directly above the old mill
was a rochester oil-lamp about as large
and rotund as a vinegar-barrel the ex-
plosion hit that rochester lamp blew it up
against the ceiling and flattened it out to
the thinness of a pancake the darn lamp
stuck against the ceiling

  every board on the stage was busted and
splintered rocks sand gravel pieces of
on and of i-



tar paper and plain clay mud flew hither
and yon and that sacred piano with the
self-cocking back was a wreck they later
on picked about half a ton of debris out of
the entrails of that shining implement of
melody

  in a way it was funny and in another
way it was not in all that crowded audi-
ence not a soul was hurt except for maybe
a scratch or two the beer-keg exploded
over their heads and the gravel and stuff
was blown clear through the house above
the heads of the audience later on  per-
sonally pickcd chunks of rock as big as
an egg out of the wall at the rear of the
theater

  every window in the theater was blown
out and all the windows in the hotel next
door were shattered into fragments

  old man hutter picked himself up and
began one of the loudest and most profane
speeches in the history of the town jim
caldwell was out in the alley when the
thing blew up and he did not return to see
how good it was in fact he concealed
himself in a livery-stable all night

  there was no third act to  on the
border the audience indicated that it
had about enough of the dramatic art for
one night besides which some feared the
roof of the place was coming down

  and when the excitement died down i
was arrested thats the good part they
swore i was the guy that bought the fuse
which was true the entire town had seen
me light that fuse so there could be no
argument about it i was charged with
malicious destruction of property endan-
gering the safety and lives of an orderly
people carrying concealed weapons arson
disorderly conduct and having no visible
means of support

  furthermore the next day i was sued
on six different counts by people who said

i had damaged their property with my ex-
plosion and all this time jim caldwell
remained out of sight which was just as
well because hatch was looking for him
with blood in his eye and old man hutter
had said in public that all he wanted was
one shot at jim

  it looked like i would spend a long time
in the huttersville jail but hatch bailed
me out toward nightfall anil made arrange-
ments with the people who were demanding
my life  sneaked around in the darkness
intending to go to the hotel and see what
could be done and as  passed an alley
entrance i heard a hissing sound it was
jim hissing at me from the livery-stable

   come on out and get killed i said to
him and not any too kindly

  sneaking through the darkness he paused
 shorty he said  it looks to me like
you and i ought to move on out of this
town

   yeah i said  you have a great gift

little when you handle explosives

   they wanted a good one and i gave
it to them jim said defensively  no-
body can call that a fizzle

   no but they came near being able to
call it a funeral i rejoined  im just

  then and there jim and i ended our
dramatic careers we started through the
darkness having no ambition except to put
distance between us and huttersville next
morning a man driving a team of mules
caught up with us and thats the way we
got back to civilization

  so as i said at the start jim and i are

l buy a iiulsk

    met balliol as result of answering an
advertisement in a los angeies paper
it looked like just what i wanted
here is the ad to speak for itself

  for sale-twenty-acre ranch fine house
complete equipment ten acres walnuts eight
pears electricity water abundant income
live thousand dollars but will sell cheap for cash
near lake north of san francisco

  john balliol met me by appointment for
luncheon at a down-town hotel instantly
i saw that something was very wrong with
him

  he was a line-looking young feilow but
was terribly nervous he must have smoked
ten cigarettes with the meal that if you
happen to know is purely a city habit
then he had a way of glancing swiftly over
his shoulder as though afraid something
were about to come at him and his eyes
wandered flitted with lurking suspicion

  he was afraid of something

  but he was a gentleman a man of edu-
cation one or two things he said gave me
the idea that he was a harvard man but
he kept very close-mouthed about himself
he had a quecrly aggressive manner the
manner of one who fights yet knows that he
is licked also he wanted to sell and get
his money at once-before the following
night

   but youre not a rancher mr des-
mond he said suspicion in his eyes

	why are you interested in my property
i iaughed  largely because its a sac-
rifice for cash i replied  im no ranch-
er but a sedate artist of a sort being a
bachelor i practise interior decoration but
i paint pictures as a preferential occupa-
tion in the past year ive made so much
money through supplying really worthless
but gorgeously blended interiors to war
profiteers that my general physical condi-
tion has one llooey if you get my mean-
ing the new york medicos sent me to
california the los angeles medicos have
ordered me to get on a ranch up north
where the climate is more bracing and not
so deadly monotonous

   i get you he nodded briefly  know
anything about ranching

   i can stretch an easel between rows of
pear-trees cant i

  at that he laughed and for a moment
lost his nerve-tensed expression

   i need money he said after a bit  i
need it badly-before to-morrow night i
got the ranch several years ago ive been
improving it steadily and the house and
property are now in first-class shape and
ive spent a lot of money on it

  reason for selling i inquired

   strictly private he looked slightly
flurried but his eyes remained steady

  merely because i need the money and
need it more badly than i can tell you

the house of skulls



its a grand place up there mr desmond
deer are a nuisance you can shoot wild
hogs any time if you like fishing clear
lake has the best in the state in two or
three years after they get the boulevard
through from frisco that whole valley will
be opened up and land will be out of sight
at present its twenty miles from the rail-
road and i cant honestly brag of the
roads-

  he got out a map of lake county and
showed me the lay of the land when i
saw that the lake was thirty miles long
that his place was only a few miles from
lakeport the county-seat that it was in the
heart of the hills and within easy distance
of the big trees and of san francisco itself
i warmed up to the subject

   well i said  whats the price low-
est cash

   ten thousand cash-if i can get it be-
fore to-morrow night

  that looked queer to me ten thousand
for a place bringing in five thousand a year

   you want the money by to-morrow
i said thoughtfully  i have an old friend
in one of the banks here hell handle every-
thing for us he can make thorough in-
quiries as to the title and so forth by wire
if its as you say and if the titles clear
we can know by to-morrow noon-and ill
take it otherwise not

  he drew a long breath  im satisfied
mr desmond by the way if you put
through the deal would you consider buy-
ing a car i drove down here in mine-a
paragon four-passenger roadster ill not
need it and im already offering it for sale
if you havent a car youll find it the best
bargain on the market cost me five thou-
sand about four months ago and ill take
a thousand cash-before to-morrow night
all right  assented cautiously if
youre willing to have the paragon agency
here give her the once-over

  he was willing to have an kind of in-
vestigation made either of the ranch or of
the car inside of an hour my bank had
the ranch matter in hand and promised me
a complete report the following morning
john balliol and i went to the paragon
agency on olive street where his car was
laid up and i found no report was needed
 a-s

  the car was strictly a beauty in first-
class shape she was not exactly an eco-
nomical car but she would give good ser-
vice for years-a nifty high-class job all
around as the paragon agent described her
 liked her so well that i bought her on the
spot ranch or no ranch and ive never had
cause to regret the bargain

  that night i spent a good deal of time
wondering about my friend john balliol
he had all the earmarks of a gentleman
but for all i knew he might be a rank fraud
not a word had he said about himself other
than i have set down here

  if he had not been in a hurry and if his
ranch was as described he could have ob-
tained twenty thousand for it-easily and
his car was salable for double the price i
had paid he was obviously in the posi-
tion of one who is madly sacrificing all that
he has in order to raise quick money- be-
fore to-morrow night he had said of
course it was none of my affair aside from
the business end of it

  at ten the next morning i went to the
bank where balliol was already waiting
the cashier beckoned me into his private
office and spread several telegrams before
me

   everything looks correct mr des-
mond he stated  in fact everything is
correct the title is flawless and the land
is worth much more than is asked

   and this mr balliol himself i said
 will you satisfy yourself that hes what
and whom he says he is

  the cashier grasped this somewhat in-
volved query and nodded then he sum-
moned balliol to join us at first balliol
was inclined to be insulted then we made
him realize that to hand out ten thousand
in cash to a man without identification was
somewhat risky he immediately calmed
down and not only produced all kinds of
papers but had himself identified by one of
the largest banks in the city just around
the corner from my own bank in short
john balliol was all to the good

   you attend to the transfer i said
when balliol produced the deeds to the
property and handed them to the cashier
the latter nodded and left us alone

   now mr balliol i said when i had


all-story weekly

written the check and was waiting for it to
dry  this deal is going through in fact
it has gone through i wish as between
gentlemen that youd tell me anything you
know against the property-why youre
giving it away

   he turned a little white under his healthy
tan and fished for a cigarette

   cant do it mr desmond he re-
sponded  its-well its private abso-
lutely nothing whatever against the
property upon my word i got into a bit
of trouble however and had to have the
money thats all

  of course i asked no further questions
and the deal was concluded on that basis
i had made out the check to him personal-
ly and he did not cash it but took it away
with him he did not even ask the bank
about my standing which made me feel
rather ashamed of my insistence regarding
him but as we separated with mutual ex-
pressions of good will i saw him walk away
-and glance again over his shoulder with
fear in his eyes

  he had two checks amounting to eleven
thousand of my money and i had his ranch
and his car and that little paragon boat
believe me was a wonder it was a dis-
tinctive car with a specially built body
and the color was bright canarv-yellow-
light enough not to show dust easily the
top had plate-glass and solid curtains and
was a deep maroon in hue taken all in
all the car could be recognized several
miles away as the only one of its kind on
earth particularly as the wire wheels were
a bright pea-green the top was low and
deep of the back-curved variety which ef-
fectually hides the driver and passengers

  speaking for the new york decorator i
could not say that yorke desmond was ex-
actly wild about the color-scheme of that
car i forgot this in the beauty of her per-
formance however later on perhaps 
would have the paint changed

  according to john balliol i would have
nothing on earth to do except to sit around
while my walnuts and pears grew and rake
in the shekels when they were ripe every-
thing was bought on the hoof as it were so
i did not even have to pick the fruit this
suited me naturally of course explained

balliol the ground had to be cultivated
once or twice a year and the pear-trees had
to be sprayed in the summer but all equip-
ment was on the place such mild diver-
sions would but relieve me from the mo-
notony of having nothing to do

  as they say just off broadway it listened
good

  it was noon when the sale was consum-
mated as i have described within an
hour i had two extra cord tires reposing on
the hind end of my new car and a com-
plete outfit of maps from the automobile
club and an outfit of suit-cases on the run-
ning-board by two oclock i had packed
up my belongings shipped my artistic im-
pedimenta by express to myself at lake-
port and at two-five i was heading toward
hollywood and the coast highway north

  my mental attitude was precisely that of
a child with a new toy i wanted to drive
that paragon bus for all she was worth and
only the fear of speed cops held me down
i was wild to get up to my new ranch and
see how the walnuts and pears grew so
having nothing particular to keep me in
los angeles i got on my way without de-
lay either i had bought a wondrously
good thing or  had somehow got won-
drously stung-and the chances were that
i had not been stung

  by six oclock that evening i was safely
arrived in santa barbara for the night
ahead of me were the alternate patches of
boulevard and most abominable detouring
which constitute the state highway to san
francisco and i was supremely happy in
the way the paragon rustled along

  that canary car with the green wheels
and maroon top certainly attracted atten-
tion this was the only fly in my ointment

i am essentially a modest and retiring man
and  abominate being taken for some orna-
ment of the film industry any one who
had ever seen that car would remember it
to his dying day and i never passed a car
on the road that my rear-sight mirror did
not show me the occupants craning for-
ward for another eyeful of my beauty all
this bothered me but caused me no partic-
ular worry

  i could not forget however the pe-
culiarity of john balliols manner i felt
the house of sklils



sorry for the chap felt rather as though i
jd taken advantage of a man when he
was down elated as i was over my bar-
gain i thought to myself that if the ranch
panned out id send him an additional five
thousand later

  but i could not forget him as  had last
seen him-glancing over his shoulder as
though half expecting something to pouncc
on him

chapter ii

i meet a l-ady

it happens to be the case in california
that the los angeles newspapers circu-
late north and the san francisco papers
circulate south until they overlap and die
they circulate swiftly too i was up and
out of santa barbara before seven oclock
and had the last los angeles edition in my
pocket when  went to breakfast the
point of this digression will arrive in its
proper place

  beyond glancing over the head nes of
my paper i did not look through it but
jammed it into my overcoat-pocket for later
consumption if only i had read that pa-
per things might have happened otherwise
-or they might not alls for the best

  i got off in a drenching fog and drizzle
of rain which i was assured was the usual
southern california  high fog there
were no speed cops out at this time of day
so in half an hour i was finishing the
twenty-odd miles of boulevard north of the
city by which time the fog was breaking
and the sun streaming forth gloriously

  the worst road  ever took or ever hope
to take befell me then and there it was a
detour and there were miles of it alongside
the newly constructed but unfinished bou-
levard then  swung into a bit of pre-
sumably finished road with unfinished cul-
verts at the bottom of each hill the first
one nearly took my head off when we
struck then more miles and long miles
of plain road-about as bad as the detour
then boulevard again thank heaven that
lasted this took me until eleven in the
morning

consulting my road maps  found that

i was close to a town-the name i have for-
gotten-and should reach san luis obispo
for luncheon with fair road most of the
way being in a hurry i stopped in the
town long enough to buy gasoline and i
happened to stop at the first gasoline sign i
saw which was near the railroad station
recalling the circumstance later i remem-
bered that my car was headed north quite
obviously

  while the tank was being filled a north-
bound train passed through without a stop
and the garage man said that it was the
 flier  from los angeles it had left
there some time the previous night and
passed here  regular as clockwork nat-
urally at the moment i thought nothing
whatever of the incident

   good highway all the way to san
luis observed the man while he made
change for me no speed-cop out to-
day neither the boy got run into day
fore yesterday so burn her up if ye want
but keep your eye skinned north o san
luis partner gosh say aint this car a
real oriole though

  thanking him i climbed in and proceed-
ed lo  burn her up the bad roads of
the morning had delayed me and i was
anxious lo make time i made such good
time that i passed the limited train just be-
fore reaching san luis and finding that it
was still on the good side of noon i deter-
mined to push on to paso robles for
luncheon

  about twelve thirty i was in paso ro-
bles still untouched of any speed-cop
leaving my car before the garage in the
main street i began to skirt the block from
store-fronl to store-front in search of
luncheon now i do not want to pain the
good citizens of paso robles but i was too
ignorant to go back a block to the big ho-
tel i merely asked for a restaurant and
was directed accordingly so i had no
kick coming

  at last oh the other side of the block i
found a place settled down to a table and
to my surprise found the food really en-
durable as i ate  continued my perusal
of the morning paper it was the only los
angeles paper in those parts t imagine-
for i saw no other there or north of there


aij-story weekly

  the paper was in two sections and on
the front page of the second section was a
photograph of john balliol

   as i glimpsed that picture i felt a prem-
onition a fore-warning beneath it was his
name and nothing more but to the left
was a three-column story entitled  scion
of prominent eastern family a suicide
above this heading after the custom of
that particular paper was another hading
in very small type being the quotation
 one more unfortunate

   it was just as well that  had about fin-
ished my meal for now i was past eating
the thing stupefied me left me blankly
dazed and to think that i had carried this
paper with me all the way from santa bar-
bara

  i plunged into the story eager and hor-
rified there seemed to be no mystery at
all in the affair so far as the newspaper
was concerned except that there was no
mention of balliol having any money he
had merely plugged up his room and turned
on the gas this he had done shortly before
midnight an hour later the thing had
been discovered and the story had broken
in time for the newspaper to cover it fully
in the last edition

  friends of balliol had volunteered that
he had left a sister whose whereabouts were
totally unknown and an uncle in boston
balliols father had been a prominent bos-
ton lawyer who had died some years pre-
viously leaving his family absolutely noth-
ing balliol himself had made a little
money after leaving college and some years
before had gone on a ranch in the northern
part of the state there he had struggled
along fighting a losing game against the
lean wolf poverty and so forth in des-
peration he had come to los angeles had
tried to sell his ranch and had committed
suicide the story was played up abso-
lutely as that of a man weary of striving
against the world and had evidently been
obtained from friends of balliol

  for that very reason it left me dazed
and bewildered four months previously
john balliol had bought a five-thousand-
dollar car-a fact of which the newspaper
was ignorant that did not look like the
grim wolf stuff he had expressly told me

that the car  cost him  that amount-not
that it had been presented to him

  of course he had wanted money very
badly on those two days when i had seen
him but he had got the money so why
the deuce had he killed himself the
paper stated that his hotel bill in los an-
geles where he had been stopping five days
had been unpaid and that his personal ef-
fects amounted to nil what the deuce
had he done with my eleven thousand dol-
lars then the thing began to look queer

  investigating more thoroughly i discov-
ered that balliol had been known at the
bank which had identified him for me but
that he had no account there one of the
bank officers had known him at college
that was all nothing was known about
his having sold anything to yorke des-
mond  my checks had not been found upon
him and neither had my money by the
time this information came out the paper
would hardly consider it worth reviving the
affair balliol had killed himself the pres-
ent article made a plausible story and noth-
ing else mattered he had certainly  gone
west  of his own volition and act and mo-
tives were unimportant

  yet  knew that he had not killed him-
self because of poverty the man had
been afraid of something-that was it as
f sat there and stared at the paper i felt
absolutely convinced that if the truth were
known john balliol had killed himself to
escape from something that had made him
a nervous fear-filled wreck what had
happened last night to make him plunge
over the brink

  realizing of a sudden that i was out-
staying the noon hour and my welcome i
paid the waitress and asked to use a tele-
phone by dint of paying the fee in ad-
vance i got los angeles by long distance
and presently was speaking with the cashier
of my bank

   yorke desmond speaking i informed
him  im at faso robles and going north
to that ranch i bought just saw the paper
about balliol did he cash my checks

   no mr desmond returned the
cashier  if they are presented well take
every step to verify the indorsements of
course it seems to be quite a mystery
the house of skulls



    all right thanks address me at lake-
 port in case of need

    rang off and left the place stuffing the
 newspaper into my pockct one thing was
 certain the reporter had goti the wrong
 steer from balliols friends balliol had
 not killed himself because of poverty-not
 in the least why he had told me that he
 had furnished his ranch-house with all elec-
 tric appliances and the best furniture he
 could get in san francisco xo his grim
 struggle had been one fine little myth but
 it had satisfied the press and had evidently
 been meant to satisfy the press-why to
 keep the real truth concealed of course
 his friends were shielding him

   it was none of my business but i could
 not help checking up on my private convic-
 tions first john balliol had been afraid
 of something-either something in his past
 such as disgrace which was hounding him
 or something tangible and terrible in his
 present second this fact was known to
 those in most intimate touch with him and
 was being kept quiet

   thinking thus and bein more or less
 absorbed in my trend of thought i came
 back to the main street and my bright-hued
 car a crowd of natives were standing
 about in admiring comment which tended
 to make me want to get away from there
  jumped in and released the brake pressed
 the starter and was off regardless of
 warning signs i went through town on
 second at a pretty good clip then eased
 down into third and hit for san francisco
 at an even thirty

    damn the whole affair i said aloud
  what if those checks were stolen from
 him last night-

   as the words left my lips i heard a sub-
 dued gasp then an exclamation it came
 from the rear section of my car i flung
 one startled glance over my shoulder then
 i switched off the mag and put on the
 brakes as we came to a halt i half turned
 in my seat and stared blankly at the young
 lady and the suit-case

   she was staring at me just as blankly-
 more so in far she seemed undeniably
 frightened she had the suit-case on the
 short rear seat beside her and it was a
 very good suit-case of expensive make

   who-who-what are you doing in
this car she stammered anger creeping
into her voice

    was up against it somehow just how
i was not at all sure she seemed perfectly
sane and i liked her voice immensely i
liked her face too it was a healthy sen-
sible sort of face and it was exquisite into
the bargain she was dressed in a traveling
suit which spelled something better than
california tailoring

   who are you she demanded half
startled and half angry  answer me
what are you doing with this car

    driving it madam i answered  i
-er-i trust you dont mind

   she stared at me again i removed the
big yellow goggles pushed up my cap and
threw open my duster

   xow i said comfortably were on
an even basis sincc you wear gloves i
presume you are not a californian-proba-
bly a mere californiac i hope you wont
think me offensive when i say that this is
literally a charming surprise probably
theres been a mistake somewhere i dont
see possibly how i can have got into the
wrong car- 

    stop that nonsense she cried out and
i observed that she had very blue eyes and
remarkably pretty eyes  drive this car
back instantly

   back-where i inquired  rack-
have you stolen this car she flung
at me as if she really thought i had

   xo  said and laughed  xo
madam this car is protected from theft
by reason of its color no thief would at-
tack it the car belongs to me it really
does i went on for her appearance of
fright sobered me  if you doubt it look
at the prescribed card here by the dash
which was legally affixed before i left los
angeles it bears my name and the cars
number-

    do you dare pretend that you are john
balliol she flashed out scornfully

    heaven forbid i said gravely  bal-
liols dead t bought the car madam day
before yesterday only an hour ago i saw
in the paper an account of his death-

   i cursed the impulsive words for she
stared at me her eyes slowly widening in


all-story weekly

horror the color ebbing out of her face
then she collapsed in a dead faint

chapter iii

i receive a warn inc

i had never had a fainting lady on my
hands before except once when mrs
wanderhoof of peoria saw the fifth
avenue apartment  had decorated for her
and looked at the bill in that instance
mr wanderhoof had assumed charge but
in this instance-

  we were out of sight of paso robles and
there was not a soul nor a house in view
there was no water to throw on the girls
face-she was no more than a girl i judged
-and the radiator water was apt to be
dirty so not knowing what else to do
i swung over into the rear seat beside her
and set her slim drooping body upright
against the cushions as i did so i was
relieved to see her blue eyes flutter open

  then i remembered a flask of whisky in
the door-pocket and produced it i got the
screw-cup to her lips but at the first taste
she pushed it away

   thank you she said in a low voice
 i-i am very well now

  she seemed unable to take her eyes from
me the color slowly crept back into her
cheeks but in her eyes  read a bewildered
fear

  then she said something strange

you said-they killed jack after all

  i was puzzled jack oh she must
mean john balliol the poor girl-i must
have given her a stiff jolt

   no i said gently  no one killed
balliol madam  have the paper here
with an account of it it was suicide may
i ask if you are a friend of his

  she seemed to shudder slightly and drew
a long breath

   yes i am a-a friend she said in
a low voice and flushed i had the uneasy
conviction that she was lying to me
 your words were-a shock i saw him
only last night before my train left-or
rather yesterday afternoon

   when this car passed the train this
morning i felt that it was he i knew we

were ahead at paso robles so i left the
train and waited-and i saw the car and
got in when you came along i thought it
was jack-and meant to surprise him-and
when you spoke  discovered-

  she broke off the words failing her
that told me the whole story of course
even from the train she had not been able
to mistake this accursed car

   but i objected gently  you must
have known that balliol could not be ahead
of you if you saw him just before your train
left-

   but it was only six last night when i
saw him and my train did not leave until
nearly midnight-theres been a wreck
somewhere and the trains were all held up
it never occurred to me that he was not in
the car-

  she broke off again staring at me

   my name is yorke desmond i said
trying to make matters smooth to my
dismay i saw her eyes widen again with
that same startled expression i could
have sworn that she had heard my name
before

   i met mr balliol two days since on
business i bought a ranch from him in
fact and bought this car to boot im on
my way up to the ranch now if as i pre-
sume you were cn route to san francisco
i shall be very glad to place the car at
your disposal

  she looked away from me looked at the
horizon with a fixed despairing gaze my
dismay became acute when i perceived that
she was going to cry and she did

   oh she flung up her hands to her
face suddenly  oh-and to think that
it took place last night-right afterward
and now its too late-

  a spasm of sobbing shook her body not
knowing what else to do and feeling that i
had been a blundering ass i went for a
walk and let her cry it out all my mar-
ried friends tell me that crying it out is the
only solution

  as i paced down the roadside i found
myself extremely puzzled even suspicious
she had admitted to me that she had seen
balliol the previous evening but first
when she had not been on guard at all
she had cried out  they killed jack
the house of skulls



after all ltpon hearing that balliol was
dead she had immediately taken for grant-
ed that they had killed him things
looked rather badly

  the initials on her suit-case which i had
seen were m j b was she a balliol
no she had said that she was a friend
and had distinctly said  friend no
 relative and she had been lying about
it somehow a minute later she had lied
when she told of seeing balliol the pre-
vious night for her train had nol been
late it had left tos angeles a little be-
fore midnight on regular schedule  regu-
lar as clockwork had said the garage-
man as the train had passed us t remem-
bered that incident now

  this girl must have known balliol pretty
well she had seen him last night and he
had gone from her to his suicide and by
heaven she knew it she was lying

  well this conclusion gave me quite a
jolt to be frank that girl did not look
like an ordinary liar and she did not lie
with practised ease why should she de-
liberately set out to deceive me  could
not see any light whatever and the mys-
terious  they  whom she took to be bal-
liols murderers

  the whole affair was strictly none of my
business as i walked back to the car i
took out my pipe and filled it this girl
was in trouble and my best course was to
mind my own affairs and ask no questions

  when  had regained the car i found
that the girl had composed herself and was
now staring at the horizon again-a poor
crumpled bit of exquisite femininity i re-
moved my cap and addressed her

   madam it seems that there has been a
mistake somewhere tlease consider me at
your service in any way possible if you
want to get to frisco we can reach there
to-night  believe

  her gaze came to me for a moment and
she drew a deep breath

   thank you mr desmond she said
quietly but she did not give me her
name  jack told me of selling his ranch
to you but did not mention the car that
was how my mistake came lo be made

  her lips quivered and she looked down
then she forced herself into calm again

   if-if it would not be asking too much
will you take me on lo san francisco with
you she pursued  im very sorry in-
deed to have made this terrible blunder

   it will be entirely my pleasure mad-
am  returned rather pointedly but she
did not take the hint and obviously intend-
ed to keep her identity to herself so i
got into the car and as i did so removed
the paper from my pocket

   here is the newspaper in question i
added handing it to her

  she took it in silence and leaned back
again

  i started the car and we went on

  for the remainder of the afternoon the
two of us exchanged scarcely a word once
or iwice  attempted to divert her thoughts
by comments upon the road or the coun-
try but she discouraged my efforts quite
visibly  was too occupied with the road
which again alternated good with bad to
let my mind dwell upon the mystery of the
girl

  we made time however i took the
chance of speed-cops and let out the
iaragon on the good stretches to my
satisfaction we got into salinas a trifle
before seven oclock with fine boulevard
all the rest of the way to san francisco

   we have about a hundred and twenty
miles ahead i remarked to my compan-
ion as we rolled into salinas l we had
better get a bit to eat here for we cant
make frisco before ten or eleven oclock i
imagine you had no luncheon i added
hastily seeing a refusal in her eye  so i
must really insist that you eat something

  she had been crying again but assented
composedly to my request we located a
greek restaurant and went in together
after a cup of execrable coffee and some
alleged food we felt better

    xow for the last lap  said cheerful-
ly as we came out again to the car  i
havent much faith in the speed-cop myth
so well let her out while the goings good
all set

   yes thank you she responded set-
tling herself in the rear

   we started north and the iaragon flitted
along like a bat out of purgatory she
was a sweet boat for speed when it got


all-story weekly

gloomy i threw on the headlights and the
big spotlight which formed a part of her
equipment and we zoomed past the cali-
fornia landscape in the finest fashion
imaginable these vast stretches of coun-
try were entirely different from the driving
around new york and i liked the change
immensely it was intoxicating

  then we came to the extraterritorial
suburbs of san francisco after getting
through san jose and palo alto and safely
past the military camp  am not at all
certain where the spot was but i know
the paragon was hitting a pretty good clip
when into the zone of light beside and
ahead of us flashed a man on a motor-
cycle he passed us like a flicker then he
slowed down and extended his hand

   good night i remarked with sinking
heart  there was a basis for the myth
after all

  when we were halted the motorcycle
planted itself at my elbow and the officer
took out his pencil and pad

   know how fast you were going he
inquired

   im afraid to guess i said meekly
 your words good officer

   i made it fifty-eight he observed
 also theres a headlight-law in this state
and youve got a blaze of lights there that
would blind a shooting star and your
tail-light is on the bum thats three
counts you seem to be sober

  thank heaven  am i returned
 anything else

  he grinned and took down more infor-
mation about me than would have filled a
passport then he gave me a slip and
told me to report to a certain san francisco
judge at ten in the morning

   isnt there any way out of the delay
i queried  im trying to get north in a
hurry

   so i judged he retorted  too much
of a hurry well  must say youve took
it like a gent- tell you what run
along with me and well drop in on a jus-
tice of the peace this is a first offense
so you can give bail-and forget it see
of course were not supposed to give this
info but-

   but youre a gentleman i added

 and ill make it right with you if you
can fix that tail-light of mine id appre-
ciate it

   jolted out o contact i guess he said
a moment later go ahead

  half an hour later we were once more on
our way with full instructions as to the
proper rate of speed and i was minus fifty-
five iron men and lucky to get off that
cheaply but the whole thing had delayed
us so that it was hard on midnight when
we saw the gay white way of van ness
avenue off to our left i halted the car
and turned around

   asleep comrade no well if youll
be good enough to give me orders ill take
you wherever youre going

  m j b gave me the name of a hotel
on sutter street where she was known fa-
vorably it seemed and instructed me to
drive up van ness she appeared quite at
home in the city i followed her instruc-
tions and ten minutes later drew up before
the doorway of a quiet family hotel i
helped her out of the car with her suit-
case but she refused to let me take it inside
for her she held out her hand

   thank you mr desmond for your
kindness she said earnestly  and-ive
been trying to think over whats right to do
would you take some very serious advice
from me

   id take anything from you i said
smiling shoot

   i am not joking mr desmond she
made grave response  please please do
not go on to the ranch i cant give you
any reasons but i mean it deeply for
your own sake do not go on to the ranch
not until the end of the month at least
good-by

  she picked up her suit-case and was
gone leaving me staring after her

shock and a fainting-spell the girl would be
in pretty bad nervous condition  took
for granted that she was overwrought and
let it go at that

  as i wanted to reach lakeport the next
night and had a plenitude of bad roads
ahead i was up and off at seven the fol-
lowing morning ferrying over to sausa-
lito delayed me and before getting to san
rafael i was off on a detour which took me
around nearly to petaluma the road was
fair but outside petaluma i picked up a
tenpenny-nail held upright by a scrap of
wood and it took one of my cord tires in a
jiffy fixing that held me up a little
while

  i got to santa rosa in time for an early
luncheon and discovered that i was going
to make lakeport in the afternoon barring
accidents this was good news i also
discovered that the last place i could get
any liquid refreshment was at the famous
tavern kept by one mccray on ahead
so about one oclock i drew up before the
wide-spreading place in the shade of the
immense oaks that shade the tavern-
grounds and went in to get a long slim
drink

  in view of the after-developments of that
same day it might be well to set down that
i had one drink and one only upon re-
turning to my car i came to an abrupt
halt in some astonishment a young man
was standing by the off rear wheel and he
was not observing me at all he was well
dressed but rather swarthy in complexion
this country was full of italian french
and swiss grape specialists as i had learned
coming north so there was no stating the
antecedents of the young man what in-
terested me and seemed to be absorbing
him was the fact that he had a knife in
his hand and was industriously pecking
away at one of my rear tires

  at times i yield to impulse and this was
one of the times i reached that young man
in two jumps and banged him solidly into
the car then jerked him upright and plant-
ed my fist rudely against his nose allowing
him to sprawl in the dust

  he picked himself up and went away in
a hurry swearing as he went

  of all the infernal deviltry  ex-

claimed as he vanished among the trees
 that fellow certainly had his nerve-

    was relieved to find that he had effected
no damage beyond a hole in the casing
that had not yet reached the breaker strip
taking for granted that he had had a drop
to much i climbed into the car and de-
parted

  within no long time i had reached the
village of hopland my destination on the
highway from here a toll-road ran over
the hills to lakeport and i turned off with-
out pause in the village thankful that the
end of my trip was in sight-as i thought

  that road was a brute-thick with dust
barely wide enough for two cars to pass
and with crumbly edges and a sheer drop
at that and a steep up-grade for five solid
miles in places it was a very beautiful
road winding up between forested growths
of redwoods and giant conifers as i
nursed the paragon up that road at fifteen
miles an hour i had plenty of time for re-
flection

  back to questions again out of the
general muddle these had resolved them-
selves into certain distinct and coherent
queries and they fell under two heads

  john balliol r whom had he been
afraid of and why unknown  what
had brought him to suicide not poverty
certainly  what had he done with my
checks when they were cashed i would
know  why had he needed the money
by a certain night-the night he was to
meet m j b the night he killed himself
unknown

  m j r the fair unknown  what
was her connection with balliol mystery
 did his suicide hinge on his meeting
with her problematical  she had said
they killed him were they mi-
crobes or gunmen unknowable  why
her warning against my going to the ranch

  my answer to that final query was
 because she liked me it was a satisfac-
tory answer too it made me glow hap-
pily i had always been a sedate bachelor
but i must say that m j b was the most
attractive girl i had ever met and to find
her interested in me was to say the least
very pleasing

   my only regret was that i had left her in


all-story weekly

san francisco i thought of going back to
the city as soon as i had inspected my
ranch-

  just then i observed that my radiator
was boiling what with the grade and the
hot sun and ahead of me was a spring
beside the road with a turn-out  halted
the car at the turn-out baled cold water
into the radiator with a rusty tin can and
sat down to smoke and let my engine cool
off it was a coo and pleasant spot under
lofty pines

  i was just knocking out my pipe when
i heard voices and the creaking of a ve-
hicle around the sharp bend ahead came
a horse and buggy the latter occupied by
three men all three carried rifles and
knives and beneath the buggy trotted a
big hound they nodded to me and drove
to the spring letting the horse have a
mouthful obviously they were natives

   good afternoon i returned their
greetings  why the artillery sheriffs
posse

  they grinned and laughed

   deer season opened yesterday one of
them replied  thought youd come up
from the city for the same reason

   xot i was my answer  plenty of
deer around here

   thats what they say-but there aint
none when we want to get em most of
the folks in lakeport are out from the
chink laundryman to the sheriff

  they drove on down the trail but as
they went  could see that they were look-
ing back and making observations-proba-
bly on my car until they passed out of
sight at the next curve they were still star-
ing backward and discussing something
either me or the car i took for granted
that it was the car and it was

  the deer season did not interest me par-
ticularly because  have no taste for hunt-
ing cursing the foot-thick dust in the
road  got into the car and went on

  at last to my deep relic i i attained the
summit of the divide where the toll-gate
was located i paid my dollar fifty and
had a magnificent view of clear lake in
the distance amid the hills then started
downward the descent was steep enough
and winding but three miles of it brought

me to the floor of the valley in a region
of jackpine and brush and hogbacks

  and as  turned a quick curve there
before me in the road stood two deer-
does for the fraction of an instant they
gazed at me then they flung away like
brown streaks they went over the nearest
hill and were gone instinctively  halted
the car gazing after the graceful creatures
a moment later i shoved my foot toward
the starter but  was still staring at the
hillside instead of touching the starter my
fool touched the accelerator-and touched
it with a particular pet corn i smothered
an oath and leaned far forward to clutch
my aching toe for the stab of pain was
acute and as i leaned over thus a bullet
came exactly where i had been sitting at
about the height my head had been

  i know it was a bullet because i heard
it and because the effect was terrific it
plumped through the rear of the top on
one side it passed above me and its shrill
song was lost in a rattling smash of glass
as it took the top half of my wind-shield
into slivers then came the crack of a rifle
to prove that it was a bullet

  if i had not happened to lean over and
to lean over pretty far that bullet would
have finished me-sure

  my first instinct was to start the car and
get away then i checked the impulse and
slid out to terra firma some one not very
far off was shooting recklessly and it made
me angry

  hopping out in the road i stared around
naturally i saw nobody if any hunter
had mistaken that maroon top for a deer
he was not advertising his mistake to me

   shove fer home balliol  cried out a
rough voice  shove quick or hell give
ye a closer one

  the voice came from somewhere behind
and to the left of the car bailiol i was
being mistaken for balliol-and there was
no mistake being made

  as this astounding fact percolated to my
brain i wasted no time asking questions
but climbed into the car started her up
and rolled away from there in a hurry
balliol who in the name of goodness
was trying to assassinate john balliol

  in that rough voice from the hillside
the house of skulls



had been a deadly earnestness which had
impelled me to flight it brought home to
me in a flash that i was up against some-
thing serious under the blue sky under
the hot august sunlight the thing was ex-
tremely matter of fact i thought again
of the young man who had been jabbing
my tire and of the warning administered
by m j b the sequence was pretty
plain

  absurd as it seemed this land-cruise of
mine was actually taking me into perilous
waters

  it was the fault of the car of course
people thought that balliol was driving it
as i rattled across a bridge and entered
upon excellent dirt roads the realization
cheered me immensely balliol had admit-
ted that he had gotten into trouble up here
of a private nature well the minute his
enemies discovered that i was not john
balliol but yorke desmond i would be
left alone yet why in such case had the
girl warned me i gave it up

  with a suddenness for which i was un-
prepared lakeport jumped into my imme-
diate foreground i had anticipated a
county seat of some importance but 
found it a village struggling along the lake-
shore with a single main street and out-
lying residences the valley had been set-
tled by missourians back in the fifties-
and they were still here

  presently i descried a charming square
and court-house with a fine new carnegie
library down by the lale front except
for a couple of docks and some moored
launches and houseboats the lake front
consisted of reed-beds and was not beauti-
ful but the lake itself with the moun-
tains opposite was magnificent

  volcanic action had done its work well
in this place and it was the sweetest spot
i had seen in california once the town
was wakened from its sleepy repose it
would be a second geneva

  as the deed to my ranch had been sent
on here for recording i drove direct to the
court-house left the car and walked up to
the county recorders office on the right of
the main building there i found every-
thing in order and awaiting me i inquired
for the sheriff meaning to set him on the

trail of my near-assassin but found that he
was hunting deer so was every one else
in town who could get away even as my
hunter-informants had stated

  i walked half a block to the bank with
whom my los angeles bank had cor-
responded the bank was closed for it
was after four oclock but  telephoned
and obtained admission i presented my
credentials to the banker an extremely cor-
dial chap and asked directions to my prop-
erty he showed me exactly where my
ranch lay and outlined the road

   tell me one thing confidentially i
inquired do you know why balliol left
here do you know anything against that
property-any reason why  shouldnt have
bought it

    certainly not  he answered with evi-
dent surprise  balliol left because of his
health i believe and for no other reason
the property is absolutely good and a
give-away at the price mr desmond
you got a good thing

  he was in earnest beyond a question
but as i sought the street again i found
myself wishing that he had phrased it in
some other fashion than  because of his
health

   after my late experiences it had an omi-
nous sound

chapter v

 discover skulls

i stopped at the hotel that night and
the next morning departed to my ranch
it lay about twenty miles from town
by road as i had to get around mount
kenocti to reach it by water it would be
much closer the ranch lay at the edge
of the lake and balliol had done his
clearing with the eye of an artist the
house itself was built of rough-hewn timber
and cement and was admirably situated at
the edge of a small bluff over the water
about it stood gigantic white oaks while
the orchards ran back on the other side of
the road

  although i had half expected more ex-
citement on my trip i met with nothing
untoward


all-story weekly

  in lakeport i had loaded up with
camping supplies a bit of forethought
which came in handy as i ran down the
side road to the house and opened up the
gates i was filled with delighted anticipa-
tion with half an eye i could see that the
place was a gem of beauty the gates
open i ran the car inside then shut the
gates again i was in my own domain at
last

  fortunately i had telephoned the elec-
trical people on the previous afternoon so
that i found the electricity turned on-the
place was on the power-line which in cali-
fornia gives right to the juice whether it
be in a desert or a mountain canon

  of course one expects to get something
for ten thousand cash but as i opened up
the house and saw what things were like
i was astounded

  balliol must have laughed in his sleeve
at finding me to be an interior decorator
the place was furnished-and literally
crammcd-with things which in new
york would have been beyond price they
had come over with the missourians in
prairie schooners and balliol had bought
them at various farms for a song

  there were two rosewood pianos one an
importation from holland several ancient
clocks with original glass in running
order the chairs were fiddlebacks of
crotch-mahogany there were two satin-
wood cabinets genuine sheratons nd
the beds each of the two bedrooms was
furnished complete in walnut not the burl
walnut of late victorian days but the old
carved french walnut of the earliest pe-
riod all in all that furniture was a delight
to the heart

  on the more practical side the place was
ready for use from the bedding to the
electric stove in the kitchen by the time
i had investigated everything and opened
up the house the morning was nearly gone
and it was about eleven oclock when i
descended the short path that ran down the
bluff to the lakeside here was a boat-
house with a short dock beside it when i
had gained access to the boat-house by
means of balliols keys i found a launch
of small size but sturdy construction and
a fine morris canoe fishing-tackle strung

the walls and in one corner was a drum
half filled with gasoline

  i took out my pipe and sat down in the
launch not only was everything here
which balliol had described but more-
much more to think of what i had
dropped into astounded me it was much
too good to be true

  the acres of fruit-trees which must be
worth a good sum as income property
could no doubt be rented to neighbor ranch-
ers i resolved to see about it at once
all  wanted was this house and what was
in it-no gentlemans ranch for mine but
a gentlemans country home

  my ideas had changed since seeing the
place brought face to face with pear and
walnut trees as it were i lost enthusiasm
fishing tinkering with old furniture and
painting suited my lazy inclination a good
deal better

   ill get something to eat i said
knocking out my pipe into the water
 then ill try out the launch and visit the
neighbors and see about renting the
orchard it has a crop on right now so it
ought to be a good thing

  i trudged back up the path and when
i reachcd the house  noticed a curious
thing the foundations were of cement
and a low cement wall-foundation ran the
full length cf the front veranda there
were a number of curious projections from
that cement and when  came up to the
wall and examined them i found that they
were human skulls

  the gruesome find rather staggered me
they were real skulls set in the cement
wall so as to project three or four inches
and they were in good condition i am
not superstitious and  had no objections
to this scheme of decorations on personal
grounds but it struck me that balliol had
carried his search for novelty just a bit too
far

   its only a step from beaux arts to
bizarre i reflected  and my friend bal-
liol seems to have taken the step where
did he get em  wonder two-four-
six-an even half-dozen wonder if he
put any more inside i didnt notice
them-

  i hastened inside the house my thoughts
tiie house

of skulls



on the big hearth and chimney of cobbles
but i confess that to my relief i found it
was quite lacking in further remains all
the skulls were outside

   with that  paid little more attention to
the matter practically dismissing it from
my mind--and for excellent reasons i
passed out on the veranda meaning tu go
around to the car at the side of the house
and get my provisions but at the first step
i came to a dead halt with a cold chill at
my throat

  upon the cement floor of the veranda
were wet tracks they began at the door
and ended abruptly in the middle of the
floor

  yet the veranda was empty

  those were not the tracks of a man
something in their very appearance sent
queer horror rippling through me sent my
gaze quickly over my shoulder at the empty
house

  i had been gone not twenty minutes
these tracks were still wet and whatever
had made them must have come from the
lake while t was down there

   undeniably shaken by the mystery of it
 rushed back through the house to the back
door absolutely nothing was in sight i
ran around the house past the car and saw
nothing

   at the edge of the bluff i could see the
shore-line below-and it was deserted

  i came back to the veranda and stared
again at those tracks now fast drying
they frightened me there was something
about them vaguely unnatural and never
in my life had i seen anything like them
of course i had opened the wide veranda
windows and a bird might have walked in
then flown out and away-

  but a bird of this size a bird from
the lake there was no other water ex-
cept in the well behind the house from
which the house itself was supplied by an
electric motor

  and were those the tracks of any bird
alive i doubted it the size was im-
mense the shape was that of a small cen-
tral foot with four immense toes-and be-
yond these the marks of long claws unless i
were mistaken

  what was the thing-monster or halluci-

nation i tried to argue that i was self-
deceived and i failed miserably there
were the wet prints on the cement before
my eyes slowly drying away they could
not have been made more than a few mo-
ments before i returned from the boat-
house

  i felt suddenly prickly cold and very
uncomfortable and turned into the house
to go ahead with luncheon was for the
moment impossible i went into the
living-room and as  passed one of the
two pianos i suddenly descried a book
lying open upon it

  i paused to glance at the book to my
astonishment i saw upon the printed page
a cut of the exact print which i had seen on
the veranda beneath the illustration was
the legend

   fossil imprint of pterodactyl marsh collection
vale college

  the realization smote me like a blow as
i leaned over the book and read balliol
nad left that book open here of course
balliol had seen the same prints-or had
he seen the thing itself had he seen the
living actual pterodactyl the creature that
had become extinct when the world began
the flying dragon of myth and legend he
had seen the tracks at any rate just as i
had seen them

  this proved that i was under no delu-
sion about those prints but-was the
thing credible it was not the bowl of
this lake was an ancient volcano the whole
valley was of volcanic creation mineral
springs abounded a few miles distant were
quicksilver-mines the water in my own
well was mineralized now i had read
stories about prehistoric monsters coming
back to the world via extinct volcanoes and
bottomless lakes and so forth-stories that
is which were purely fiction had such a
thing really come about here in lake coun-
ty california upon my own ranch

   xot by a damn sight i exclaimed
throwing the book across the room  bal-
liol was frightfully nervous im not he
may have been frightened out of here by
his imagination-but im going to be
shown

  then and there i dismissed the unnatural


all-story weekly

fears which had shaken me if the creature
existed i would shoot it if the whole affair
were one of those queer mental quirks
which come to all men if the prints were
caused by some natural agency not sjhc
moment obvious to my deduction well and
good

  i went around to the car and hauled in
my provisions the electricity was on in
the house and i got the electric range
working and managed lo make myself a
fairly decent meal at times  found my-
self desirous of casting quick glances over
my shoulder at windows or doors but i
repressed it firmly i was not going to get
into balliols condition if i could help it

  lunch over i dragged a rocker lo the
veranda and enjoyed a smoke with the
beauties of the lake outspread before me
by reason of a deep inundation of the lake-
shore the bluff on which my house was
built faced almost due east opposite me
across the bight i saw the roofs of a farm-
house doubtless my nearest neighbor in
that direction

  it occurred to me that if i wanted to
talk business the noon hour would be an
excellent time lo do it

  so i went down to the boat-house again
opened up the water doors and filled the
boats tank with gas she was in good shape
and almost with the first turn of the wheel
the spark caught a moment later  was
chugging out into the lake feeling intensely
pleased with myself and i headed directly
down to my neighbors dock among the
tules or reeds

  the neighbor himself i found sitting on
his front porch he was a brawny beard-
ed man of stolidly slow speech henry
dawson by name i introduced myself as
the new owner of baliiols ranch and was
in turn introduced to mrs dawson and two
strapping dawson boys they al eyed me
with frank curiosity

  i lost no time in setting forth my busi-
ness dawson like all farmers was content
to let me talk as long as i would when i
cautiously broached the subject of renting
my land however he nodded his head in
slow assent

    ought to rent he slated as though he
thought just the opposite  maybe dont

know as folks would want the house
though

    want that myself  said  what
 want to rent is the fruit land could
you handle it

  at this direct assault he hemmed and
hawed he was a very decent chap how-
ever and when  made it clear that i was
not after extortionate rentals he came
around quickly  could see that the house
had killed the place for some reason

   just whats the matter with that
house i demanded while he was making
up his mind about rental  is it those
skulls in the front wall

    blamed if i know he rejoined slowly
 reckon its that much as anything
gives folks a creepy feelin

    why didnt balliol get along there
he gave me a slow stare  get along
why  guess lit got along all right he
was kind o queer in his ways ye might
say but he got along right well mr
desmond

    where on earth did he get those skulls
though

   dug em up right on the ground i
heard he done all the work himself on
that house except what he hired done
guess it was an old injun cemetery there
was a heap of injuns here in the old days
quite a bunch here yet they sent em to
a reservation but the poor devils got home-
sick and were lowed back right pros-
perous farmers some of em to-day well
about that orchard i reckon we can man-
age it if we settle on the right terms

  we settled then and there at terms
which were satisfactory to both of us

chaitkr vi

 iuy a gun

 sked dawson about big birds but he
 said there was nothing larger than a
buzzard around the lake and presently
 went home again the rest of the day
passed quietly and after writing a few let-
ters chiefly on business i went to bed and
slept the sleep of the just

   i was well satisfied with my new home
and for the coming six months my partner
the house

of skulls



in new york could run the decorating
business without my aid so there was noth-
ing to worry me

  the next morning i was up and ofi early
this time in the canoe and got in an hours
fishing before sunrise although it was
distinctly the wrong season for fish i
trolled down along the shore off the reed-
beds and picked up two fine bass both
over three pounds

  about sunrise i headed for home well
content with results i wanted to visit
lakeport this morning chiefly to see if
there was any news from my los angeles
bank about those checks that balliol had
struggled along in poverty on his ranch as
the newspaper account had said was quite
absurd that he had died in poverty with
eleven thousand dollars in his pocket was
entirely nonsensical

  across the little bay from my place i
paused suddenly i had already learned
from neighbor dawson that balliol had
obtained his skull-decoration from relics of
the red men so their gruesomeness was re-
moved in some measure but-that did
not explain what i now saw

  as it chanced i had found a pair of field-
glasses in a niche in the cobbled chimney
and had brought them along now i
raised and focused on my house rather on
the front wall under the veranda where the
skulls were located to my uneasy sur-
prise i found my eyesight corroborated
the eyes of those six skulls were gleaming
and flaming with a brilliant crimson

  optical delusion not a bit of it re-
flections from the rising sun on the concrete
which filled the skulls to the bone-level
not a bit of it such reflections would not
come in a scarlet flame from the eyes of
each and every skull they were reflecting
the lurid sunrise squarely at me of course
but those hollow eye-sockets were filled
with red fire

  i dropped the glasses seized the paddle
and spurted for home savagely determined
to run down the uncanny hoodoo which had
settled on this house of mine as i drew
nearer to my landing i could see those red
skull-eyes flaming more and more distinct-
ly there was no optical illusion what-
ever

  then i was in the boathouse beneath the
bluff and of course the house was shut
from view making fast the canoe i
paused to pick up a broken oar to serve as
club then ran up the path puffing i
gained the bluff in front of the house

  confound it i exclaimed blankly
 am i going off my head

  the crimson flame was gone from the
skull-eyes there was not a sign of it
in the sockets the white cement came close
to the surface and there could be no mis-
take

  i was completely taken aback by this
startling development

  of course i told myself there must be
an explanation perhaps the sand in the
cement was glassy and at certain angles
reflected the sun-that would be plausible
in a single instance but it would not do for
twelve eye-sockets whatever the explana-
tion might be it was certainly beyond my
comprehension then again the color of
those eye-sockets had been a distinct blood
hue

  as i stood there staring at the cement
wall i jumped suddenly from the kitch-
en of the house came a banging crash and
i remembered a double boiler i had set out
on the stove some one-or something-
was in the kitchen and had knocked it
over

  swearing under my breath i leaped to
the veranda and ran through the house
now i glanced at every room in my course
and i can swear that the house was abso-
lutely empty so was the kitchen when i
reached it yet by the stove whence it
had obviously been knocked by some direct
agency the double boiler lay on the floor
a pool of water surging from it and running
directly to the stove from the doorway-
but not back again--was a single line of
muddy tracks they were the tracks of the
pterodactyl

  i was staggered right enough a pre-
historic monster with a wing-spread of
twenty-five feet does not hide easily in a
bare kitchen yet i looked around as if
expecting to see the brute before me then
i rushed to the windows the yard was
absolutely empty the monster might be
somewhere in the encircling trees it might


all-story weekly

have flown out and down to the lake while
i was coming through the house but by
the gods it had been here those muddy
tracks on the floor reassured me certified
to my sanity and common sense

  hastening outside  looked around the
barn which served as garage was empty
i could discover no hole about the house
where any such beast could hide i flung
my club whirring amid the nearest trees
and- strode back into the house

  damn it i remarked as  set about
cooking my two fish  im going to get a
shotgun and settle this mystery i dont
believe in fictionists dreams coming true
and as for this flying dragon ill settle
him with buckshot if i get one crack at
him

  the red eyes of the skulls had paled
into insignificance before this mysterious
visitant and i forgot the lesser matter for
the time being that double boiler knocked
off the stove and those muddy tracks set-
tled the pterodactyl once and for ail as a
living creature and i meant to go after
him i only regretted that i must have
missed him by less than a minute

  my second day in my new home was
beginning in a way to make me realize why
balliol had come to los angeles with the
jumps riding him

  an hour after these things happened 
had closed up the house and was chugging
merrily away from the boat-house in my
launch navigation was no difficult prob-
lem here i merely had to head straight up
the lake which i did the voyage was
monotonous as are all launch trips in ordi-
nary craft and as i throbbed along the
wind-ruffled water the memory of m j b
recurred to me with a twinge of self-
irritation that i had not even her name

  why had she warned me and who was
the dark-complected chap who had cut at
my tires back at mccrays tavern and
who had fired that shot at me these
were perplexing problems but m j b
was more perplexing yet i once again
pictured her face before my mental vision
the trim sweetness of her the capable man-
ner which she wore the energetic woman-
hood that lay in her blue eyes-

   hang it i exclaimed  im getting

romantic-it wont do yorke desmond
youll never see that girl again so forget
her

  easier said than done i was still think-
ing of her as  tied up to the dock at lake-
port and walked up-town past the library
to the main street and within five min-
utes i was thinking of her again

  the telegraph-office was a dingy little
place messages being received here by
phone when i inquired for any wires
the young lady in charge handed me an en-
velope  found it to be a night-letter from
the cashier of my bank in los angeles it
read as follows

  check for ten thousand cashed yesterday first
national sun francisco returned here ihis after-
noon indorsements john balliol martha j
balliol xo further developments suicide good
luck with ranch

  the ulterior meaning of this message
gradually percolated through my brain and
i wandered forth to a bench on the court-
house square and sank to rest

  the check had been cashed the same
morning i left san francisco and it had
been cashed by martha j balliol-no other
than my m j b xo wonder she had
seemed to know my name when she must
have borne in her pocket-book that check
of mine balliol had given it to her the
previous night just before his suicide so
much was evident

  but- she had been balliols sister then
why had she not admitted her identity
perhaps she would have done so i argued
but for the news of her brothers death
after that to find herself traveling in her
brothers car with the man who had bought
that car and the ranch to boot must have
disconcerted her immensely at first and
after telling me that she was a friend of
balliol she probably had lacked the nerve
to confess her white lie and give her real
name perhaps she had merely considered
it unnecessary

  i felt relieved folly though it un-
doubtedly was i had indulged a secret con-
viction that m j b was balliols sweet-
heart now she proved to be his sister but
although this fact afforded great relief it
none the less gave me new anxiety t have
the house of skulls



always noticed that girls especially very
charming and attractive girls like martha
balliol are all too seldom free and heart-
whole somebody else always seems to get
acquainted with them first that was one
reason that i was still a bachelor

  but never had i met any one like martha
balliol the more i thought about her
the more i felt like a fool for having left
her in san francisco as  had done at
last realizing that  had bungled every-
thing very sadly and that it was now close
to noon and  was hungry i got up and
sauntered toward the bank seeking informa-
tion on the way however i passed a
hardware store and bethought me of the
pterodactyl there was an attractive dis-
play of guns in the window so  entered
and besought the proprietor to sell me a
shotgun

   want a license i spose he inquired
amiably  im the game warden here y
know i dunno why youre goin after deer
with a shotgun-

   im not  rejoined  im going after
pterodactyls and theres no closed season
on them

  he rubbed his chin and with a mystified
air agreed with me  well i reckon not
say you the man just bought the balliol
ranch

   yes desmond is my name

   starks mine glad to meet ye seen
any ghosts around there yet

   ghosts  met his eye and he
chuckled what do you mean

   well that place is built right close to
where the old injun chiefs is buried and
i hear tell theys ghosts around there at
times

   nothing doing i rejoined cheerfully
 not so far anyhow wheres the best
place to get a meal in town

   well ye might go several places but
if i was you id go up to mrs sinjons
back o the court-house

  he directed me and leaving the shotgun
until after luncheon i went to the boarding-
house back of the town square

  ghosts eh that was a new angle
had the natives played unpleasant jokes
upon john balliol because of his skull
decoration no the very notion was silly

    	a-s

grave stolid farmer folks like dawson were
not given to such trivial foolishness be-
sides balliols affrighted nerves must have
come from months and years of fear not
days or weeks and jokes do not extend
over months and years

   found the boarding-house simple and
thoroughly delightful the cooking whole-
some the company very mixed ranging
from a stage driver to an itinerant preacher

it was a warm noon and conversation
flagged i was just finishing my meal
when in the intermittent and broken-off
speech of farming men two workmen at
the other end of the table spoke

   heard young balliols sister come in
this mornin said one

   uhuh said the other and looked
toward the stage driver  good looker
mac

  the stage driver glanced up  got him
beat all hollow he observed  come in
on the morning train going up the lake

i reckon

   paid for my meal and departed feeling
a bit dizzy balliols sister what the
deuce was she doing here

  calling for my gun at the hardware store

 arranged about mail at the post-office
then went down to the dock and out on
the dockj all alone she was standing

chapter vii

  make discoveries

to see me sauntering along with a gun
under my arm seemed to cause her
some alarm and too she seemed
ve self-repressive her greeting was cold
then with a quick change of mood she
smiled

   are you going hunting like every one
else mr desmond

   i am miss balliol i responded

  an adorable flush stole into her cheeks
but her blue eyes did not falter

   i must apologize for that she said 
simply  it was abominable but at first

-i said that i was a friend-

   and you turned out to be a sister i
cut in  please miss balliol dont ex-
plain i figured it out for myself later on


all-story weekly

and i understand perfectly but if it is not
an impertinence may i ask what on earth
youre doing here this is an outlandish
place in which to meet any one-particular-
ly a person of whom one has thought so
much and often

  her gaze dwelt upon me thoughtfully
searchingly even suspiciously

   to be candid mr desmond  hadnt
the least intention of confiding in you she
stated coolly  but i cant help believing
that you are honest-

   oh who said that  wasnt

   you implied as much-by buying my
brothers property here

   thanks i murmured feeling pretty
well dazed

   i am going jo dawsons farm for a
short visit she went on  if you care
to see me there ill be very glad to ex-
plain matters fully i think the up-lake
launch is about due

  i did not know anything about the up-
lake launch but i took chances

   no i said positively  she ran on a
mud bar this morning and is stuck with a
broken propeller if you want to get to
dawsons will you let me take you in my
launch theres not another to be hired
i assure you besides it will let us talk
on the way

  i have a suspicion that she knew that i
was lying but if so she did not mind at
all events she accepted my invitation as
she had only her suit-case we were chug-
ging away from lakeport inside of ten
minutes she added to the mystery by
stating that dawsons took boarders and
that while she was totally unknown here
she had determined to pay a visit to the
lake on business  began to feel some-
what uncomfortable

    there are several things to straighten
out miss balliol i observed  first
your remarks about my honesty then if
you remember when i told you about your
brother you exclaimed that  they  had
killed him-

   she whitened a little

  please she checked me swiftly
 let me take things in order mr des-
mond i should not have made that remark
about your honesty it requires another

apology from me now let me get these
things out

  she opened her handbag and began to
look over papers meantime she went on
to give me some idea of her brothers past
life and of her own

  balliol senior who had been a wealthy
lawyer in boston had died suddenly six
years previously he had left few resources
except a family residence near boston and
two small undeveloped ranches here in
lake county martha balliol had at once
fitted herself for a position as stenographer
remaining at home with her mother john
balliol a boy nearly through harvard had
come to california and had set to work
developing the two ranches on clear lake

  he had worked like a trojan too as
the girl told me of what he had accom-
plished lone-handed i felt a pang of pity
for him two years before this present
time he had sold one of the ranches for a
handsome sum lie had sent a large part
of the money home to relieve conditions
there and pay off the mortgage on the
family home then meaning to bring his
mother and sister to clear lake he had
built his house on the twenty-acre ranch
and had built it well the work had taken
him nearly a year for he had done most
of it with his own hands

  during that time however some trouble
had developed to balance this he had
made money off his crops and had ordered
his paragon car specially built what with
one thing and another he had spent every
red cent that he could raise being con-
fident of the future

   then went on the girl  the trouble
increased what it was i dont know i
cant find out he only wrote about it
once and then he sent this photograph
it explains itself so far as i can discover
jack must have made an enemy of this
man and took his picture while they were
having an argument that was like jack
-he had no lack of nerve

   or of nerves either  added to my-
self as i took the letter and picture which
she handed me

  the picture was a kodak snapshot of a
very angry young man shaking his fist at
the camera there was no doubt about
the house of skulls



his anger a snarling venomous rage was
stamped all over him as i recognized his
face however an exclamation escaped me
for beyond all question it was the same-
swarthy young man who had tried to cut
my tires at mccrays tavern
 whats the matter broke out miss
balliol  you know him

   ive seen him i commented  tell
you about it in a minute

  beneath the picture was written  john
talkso registering rage

  taking the letter i read a marked
paragraph it dealt with the same john
talkso a name whose very queerness made
me wonder what nationality the young man
could be balliol had not explained this
but had written

  am having more trouble with the individual
whose picture i enclose however  hope to
obviate further trouble with him the whole
thing is so silly that one hesitates to write any
explanation dont worry about it

  that was finely indefinite was it not
it was

   about six months ago resumed miss
balliol  we got into terrible trouble and
 was afraid to write jack about it because
we were trying so hard not to increase his
worries mother was very ill and we had to
mortgage the houo again then a private
bank failed-a bank in which father had
left us a block of stock the stock had
never been any good and then on the failure
of the bank we had to pay a tremendous as-
sessment to secure the depositors-and that
finished everything for us mother died
suddenly when it was all over i wrote
jack what had happened then i went
back lo work

  i did not hasten her recital and she
paused for a few moments we were chug-
ging merrily down the lake and the heat of
the sun was relieved by a cool breeze which
brought stray locks of martha balliols
hair about her face in distracting fashion

   it was a hard blow lo jack of course
she went on  now what has happened
i dont know and cant discover mr des-
mond he wired me a month ago to meet
him in los angeles at once-he wrote little
or nothing in the interim  came to los

angeles and he did not turn up i could
not get into touch with him at all then
one morning he called me up on the tele-
phone and told me to catch the night train
for san francisco and to meet him at the
station an hour before the train left

    felt that something terrible was hap-
pening but he gave no explanation when
we met at the station he was a nervous
wreck and he was frightfully mysterious
about everything he told me to go on to
san fransciso and that id hear from him
cn route

   how did you recognize his car from
the train i broke in  youd never
seen it

   xo but he had sent us the colored
pictures when he had ordered it built and
he had sent photographs of it after he had
received it- its such a distinctive car that
no one could possibly mistake it

  that was true enough as i had discov-
ered

   well that night at the station she
pursued  jack gave me an envelope and
said lo open it fter the train had started
he made me promise him then he kissed
me good-by and said not to worry that he
had fixed everything all right for me
thats the last i saw of him mr desmond
later-on the train-i opened his letter
and found your check to him with this
note

  she handed me a note in balliols writ-
ing which read as follows

darkst sis

   the games up as far as im conccrned youll
hear about it soon enough they were too much
for me at the ranch they drove me out to put
it bluntly if  hadnt had too much cursed pride
i might have done otherwise but i fought them
and now theyll get me sure if i go back

   liesides this ive cot in bad with another deal
if i go through with it then youll lose every-
thing and i cant face it i guess im pretty well
broken down sis ive been a fool thats all
theres only one way to secure to you what can
be secured and ive taken it ive sold the ranch
for ten thousand which is far below its value and
enclose the check cash it immediately in san
francisco good-by dear little sis and make the
best of it	jack

  that was on the fac of it a cowardly
letter considering that an hour later balliol


all-story weekly

had killed himself but i could not help
remembering all that he must have endured
and fought for in the past years

   still we havent solved the secret of
the mysterious  they   observed  ex-
cept that john talkso whoever he is is
concerned in it this letter too speaks
of another deal-vague and mysterious as
ever miss balliol do you have any idea
why you brother did what he did in los
angeles

  she shook her head his suicide was
still a mystery to her

  i told her about my encounter with john
talkso and with the shot from the hills
she had warned me in san francisco mere-
ly on impulse for she had felt that there
was something vaguely but distinctly
hostile about that ranch also she had been
distrustful of me for she had imagined that
i might have been concerned in some con-
spiracy to beat down the value of the ranch
and get it cheap there is the contradic-
tion of woman for you

  well inside of twenty mi mites we were
on a solid footing of friend-hip i managed
to convince her as to my entire ignorance
of the trouble and i could see that the
poor girl had been driven nearly wild by
the mystery which had shrouded balliols
latter days

  as we drew up the lake i suggested to
martha balliol that she might care to stop
at the ranch and look over the house

   there may be books or other personal
belongings of your brothers that youd
like to keep i explained u really miss
balliol id feel much relieved if youd go
through his effects and take everything that
youd like to have ive felt very badly
over the deal because ive seemed to take
undue advantage of his circumstances
and i feel as though some reparation and
expiation were due you

  later i thought id add at least five
thousand to the purchase price of the ranch
but of course this was not the moment to
broach such a matter since it was early
in the afternoon miss balliol thanked me
and consented to stop in at the ranch for
dawsons lay just across the bay and we
could run over there in ten minutes

  accordingly we ran in to the dock and

on this occasion there was no red flare in
the skill-sockets xor did  say anything
to her about the skulls for the subject was
not a very pleasant one to bring before the
girls mind  was careful to steer her up
the hill and then around to the side of the
house and as we reached it i heard a bell
buzzing away

  hello i ejaculated  ordered the
telephone unplugged this morning-the in-
strument was in of course some ones
calling to see if the lines working maybe
go right in and make yourself at home
miss balliol-ill answer the call

  the telephone was in the kitchen and a
moment later i was at the instrument

  yorke desmond speaking  said
 hello

  it was my friend the banker at lakeport
speaking and what he had to say was one
little earful it certainly was what he
wanted from me was the address of john
balliol for no one in these parts seemed to
know that balliol was dead  wanted to
know why he wanted it

  being a banker he was mighty hard to
pin down and hold on the mat but at last
i mafic him cough up the information it
appeared that some time previously balliol
had gone on the note of a friendly rancher
to the tune of six thousand dollars fire
had wiped out the ranchers property-this
was over in high valley- and the man him-
self had broken both legs in an accident
and it was up to john balliol to make good
the six thousand now overdue

    what date was it due i demanded
the banker told me that note had be-
come due the day after i had bought
balliol ranch

    you listen here  said thinking fast
 ill come in to lakeport to-morrow and
see you and ill make good that sum
savvy never mind my reasons i owe
balliol that money so ill explain further
to-morrow

   rang off and dropped into the nearest
chair

  light on the subject  should say so
this was the  other deal  to which
balliol had referred and he sure had been
a fool to indorse the other mans note he
knew it also and knew that to make it
the house of skulls



good would wipe him out that was why
he had given up the fight

  he had sold out his ranch to me at a
give-away price in order to secure the ten
thousand to his sister he had given her
the money then had killed himself he
had left no estate whatever whether or
not the law could reach that ten thousand
i did not know at all events he had of
course figured that it was safe to martha
the banker had told me that balliol had
sent back one thousand from los angeles
-the thousand which i had given him for
his car of course

   this explained baliiois haste to get the
money it did not explain the enmity
which had existed between balliol and this
john talkso but of that  look little heed
at the moment instead of giving martha
balliol the extra five thousand  would
pay it over to the bank clear balliols name
and square myself with the dead man as
i looked at it martha balliol need never
know of it

   i had figured this out to my own satis-
faction as the best possible course when
from the front of the house i heard a cry
followed by a scream then  remembered
that cursed pterodactyl for the first time

chapter viii

i go hunting

art ha balliol had fallen
against the cobbled chimney of the
fireplace and lay in a crumpled
heap arms ouiflung to my horror 
thought he dead-then i saw upon the
floor the muddy tracks of the flying
dragon she stirred a little and al the
motion i leaped for the door

  the room was empty save for the girl
but i knew that the creature was some-
where close al hand-and  had left the
shotgun in the boat

   went down the path like a madman
secured the gun tore open the box of shells
and as i ran back up to the house i loaded
both chambers as i came to the doorway
i saw that martha balliol was sitting up
holding one hand to her head she stared
at me

   what-what was it she exclaimed

    thats what i want to know i turned
my back on her perhaps ungallantly to
seek some sign of movement from the yard
nothing stirred if the thing had been here
it had gone quickly it had vanished
among the trees   heard you scream-

   something-some one-came up be-
hind and pushed me martha balliol was
standing now and anger was flashing in
her blue eyes  i heard nothing at all the
surprise made me scream and  must have
fallen against the stones here-

  she suddenly saw the tracks upon the
floor and paused her eyes widened with
a swift fear as she pointed to them i
nodded carelessly then left the door and
placed a chair for her

   without exaggeration but omitting noth-
ing  told her about the skull-eyes which i
had seen only that morning and also of the
pterodactyl she listened in silence but
her incredulous gaze made me squirm a
bit

    you speak as if you believed it she
commented at last

   look at the tracks for yourself i
countered then getting her baliiols book
 showed her the illustration in question

   that shook her fine scorn of the story
she declared herself quite unhurt and re-
fused to let the matter drop but sat in
thoughtful silence for a little

    theres something queer about this
house she said at last and rose  lets
look at those skulls mr desmond i be-
lieve jack said something about them in
one of his letters but i dont remember the
cxact words-they were indian relics i
believe he did not say that he was build-
ing them into the house

   together we went outside and while she
inspected the skulls  scrutinized the
trees and shores but vainly the devilish
hing had hidden itself absolutely and i
could see no particular sense in going to
find it

    i cant honestly say that i care for
this sciieme of decoration declared martha
balliol  jack was always given to odd
notions like this however as for your
story of the red eyes-well ill pass on it
when  see them for myself now lets go


all-story weekly

up and look at the house that is is you
still care to have me do so

    do you still want to  queried sur-
prised bv her coolncss  youve had a
shock-

    ive been very silly you mean she cor-
rected me severely as we walked toward
the steps  about this prehistoric thing
mr desmond-didnt you say that the
steps always came in to the center of a
room then ended the foot-prints i
mean well that docs not look right to
me of course the creature might have
come so far then have flown away-

   you admit theres a creature then
i struck in

   i admit theres something to make
those tracks she said and laughed merrily
 i wish i had looked over my shoulder
when i felt the shove

   perhaps the confounded place is
haunted  said gloomily

  we spent half an hour going over the
house miss balliol picked out a few
pictures and other things which she would
like to have and i promised to pack them
up for her she was planning to stay for
a week or two with the dawsons

  althought she did not say it in so many
words i realized that her reason for com-
ing here had been to settle the mystery
which surrounded her brothers death and
she would settle it there was no doubt
that within a few days she would find out
about that note at the bank the other
trouble the trouble which had smashed
balliols nerves and which was somehow
concerned with john talkso whoever he
was lay in the background unsolved

   so when she had finished with the house
i told her frankly what the banker had just
telephoned to me to be more exact i
told it with some additions and evasions
for i did not think it necessary to say that
i was paying off the five thousand  got
around that by saying that the creditor had
paid up having unexpectedly gotten some
money and that the banker had phoned
to let balliol know it was ail right

   beyond question i got things a little in-
volved but martha balliol did not probe
the story to her mind her brother might
still have been living had he only learned

in time that he would not have to meet
the note it was a sad business of course
out of justice to the dead chap i felt in
honor bound to relate his reasons for sui-
cide which did his heart better credit than
his head

  yes taking it up and down it was a
sorry and a sordid and a dashed brave little
story balliol was a fool and a coward per-
haps but the thing he did was done in a
bravely silent fashion

  martha balliol cried a little and tried
to laugh a little but she finished with a
clear and sober understanding of why her
brother had killed himself then she said
that she thought i had better take her on
to dawsons by road the sun being pretty
hot on the water so i went out and got the
car ready and  kept the shotgun handy

  the road which ran down along the lake
shore was very dusty-the dust was six
inches deep in places this did not trouble
the paragon of course and we hummed
into the dawson yard in fine fettle mrs
dawson was there to receive us and under
her wing martha balliol vanished almost
at once

  i paused to help myself to a few necta-
rines from a tree near the honse then set
forth for home i drove rather fast for
the road was good and i got almost to
my own place when something happened
both front tires blew at the same instant

  fortunately the paragon was a heavy
boat or wed have gone topsyturvy as it
was i almost went into the trees of
course cord tires do not act as those had
acted without very definite reasons the
reasons were in the shape of stout nails
set in scraps of board which had been
buried in the dust i am afraid that 
said some very unscriptural things as i
drove home on the rims

  who was the miscreant the thing was
intentional those bits of board had been
planted since  had left home i cursed
some nr ire while i sat working on the
tube and then pumping up the refitted
tires sufficiently to reach lakeport and an
air hcse

  one thing was sure i had inherited john
balliols enemies of this i had no further
doubt if some one were lurking about the
the house of skulls



place it was a case of catch or get caught
and the afternoon was young or young
enough to do a good deal of catching in

   with these brilliant deductions crowding
me into action i began to use my head a
little obviously i had two sets of enemies
-human and inhuman the human type
was very possibly the man john talkso
the inhuman y the pterodactyl  was
as much concerned over one as over the
other and as i abandoned my tire labors
and glanced up at the house a sudden
scheme struck me

  i picked up my shotgun and sauntered
around to the front of the house for a
moment i stood at the lip of the bluff
watching the water and the shore planning
just what  would do then  hurried
down the path to the boat-house and be-
neath its shelter laid the gun in the canoe
and covered it with fishing tackle and some
burlap after this  shoved out and pad-
died down the shore away from dawsons

   since  kept close in to the shore i was
in five minutes beyond sight of my place
and to any one watching was off for a
fishing trip hut i jerked in to shore and
landed before  had gone fifty feet farther
pulling up the canoe  stowed it among the
bushes took my shotgun and struck direct-
ly up the steep slope

   it was a hard scramble but i made it
and in fifteen minutes  gained the road
hot and puffing i was not a mile from the
house and  went down the road at a
good walking clip certain of being unob-
served the trees to either hand effectual-
ly concealed me

  when at length the trees opened up to
the left i had an excellent view of my
house and farmyard i paused made my-
self comfortable among the trees got my
pipe going and began to watch flattering
myself that i had flanked the entire place
very neatly i was well placed to see what-
ever was going on but nothing was going
on it seemed things happened around
that place in bunches and just now was a
quiet moment

   i sat with the gun over my knees and re-
flected that this had been a crowded day
it was very nice to think that martha
balliol was just across the bay at dawsons

farm the neighborhood seemed very
agreeable to me of course the poor girl
was overcome because of her brother but
this was a grief which lay in the past she
had nothing unhappy ahead of her 
wished that  were as sure of the same for
myself-

   hen abruptly in the sunlight-flooded
clearing around my house i saw that for
which i had been watching and waiting

chapter ix

i meet john talkso

i- plain sight of me walking out across
j the open space toward my house was
a man lie carried a bucket in one
hand and a basket in the other hand
these he set down at the veranda steps
and then turned scrutinizing the lake and
shore his face showed clearly

  a low word escaped me as i watched i
recognized that face on the instant he
was no other than the enemy of john
balliol the man whom i had met at
mcgrays tavern-the man with the queer
name of john talkso an instant later
he had vanished inside the house

   xow i said to myself  heres one
mystery about to be solved in a hurry
a moment longer i waited talkso
appeared again stooped over the basket he
had been carrying and then went around
to the front of my house what he did
there i could not see he reappeared
took up both bucket and basket and went
into the house

  i started for the house with the gun
under my arm both barrels loaded

  when i got safely over the gate and into
the yard i knew that i had my man this
time there was going to be an explana-
tion to judge from his attire when i had
seen him at mcgrays tavern this talkso
had money-and he was going to settle
what he owed me chiefly in the matter of
tires what he was doing in my house was
another thing and if he had fired that
bullet at me from the hills-

  at that juncture  heard the telephone
ringing the kitchen windows were open
and i stole toward the back entrance an


all-story weekly

instant later i heard a man speaking at
the telephone talkso was answering the
call his infernal impudence made me
chuckle for at the instrument he must be
standing with his back to the door he
was playing directly into my hand

   hes not here-out fishing i heard
him say somebody obviously vas asking
for me  whos this oh hello this
you sheriff west

  there was a moment of silence during
which time i gained the back door and
paused talkso was standing at the tele-
phone right enough entirely unconscious
of my presence

   the hell you say he exclaimed sud-
denly a snarling intonation in his voice
none of your cursed business what im
doing here mr west what you come
out here if you want to-ill be gone by
then

  again he paused and again made angry
response to the sheriff

   nonsense youve nothing on me-
dont try bluffing me mr west you
cant do it that shot go ahead and tell
desmond all you want you know
damned well you cant prove anything on
me and i know it too ill have desmond
out of here inside of a week-oh i wont
eh much you know about it

  with a snarling oath he slammed the
receiver on the hook

  as he did so i pushed open the screen
door and stepped inside talkso caught
the squeak of the door and whirled about
like a cat

   i guess the sheriff was right talkso
i said cordially over the sights of my shot-
gun  hoist your hands -thank you
thats the way its always done in the films
so the sheriffs coming out here eh good
thing he can take you back with him
unless we come to terms

  talkso stood perfectly motionless his
hands slightly raised the surprise of my
appearance had confounded him but now
passionate rage convulsed his swarthy
features and in the snaky blackness of his
eyes flickered a scornful hatred the con-
tempt expressed in his eyes rendered me
uneasy

   you he uttered flinging the word at

me in almost inarticulate fury  what
d you think youre doing anyway

   i dont think i assured him  im
perfectly confidently about it my friend
by the way did you fire a shot at my car
the other day mistaking me for balliol
 i wish to hell the bullet had got you
he foamed

   youre a charitable cuss and since
then youve given me a lot of tire trouble
to say the least whats the idea any-
how whats back of the feud between
you and balliol

  he seemed to take no notice of the ques-
tion

  you poor fool he said scornfully
 i could have killed you any time in the
past day or two-

   well you didnt  chipped in
 come ahead and loosen up lets have
an explanation

  to my horror i realized that he was
coming at me he had the silky invisible
movement of a snake to blast the life
out of him with that shotgun was impos-
sible he seemed to be leaning forward
leaning toward me farther and farther-
and then he was in the air and on me

  he gripped me and the gun together
and we struggled for it i was ready
enough to drop the gun and slam into him
with my fists but i saw no use in letting
him perforate me with my own gun so i
hung on and we fought it out by arm-
power

  in the middle of it we lost balance and
went to the floor-and the shotgun went off
with a deafening explosion between us

  i realized quickly enough that i was not
hurt and rolled backward leaping to my
feet both barrels had exploded sending
both charges into the telephone which
hung wrecked and useless against the wall
talkso was not hurt either first thing i
knew he was up and coming at me with
a yell brandishing the shotgun like a club

  according to jiu-jitsu experts the easiest
thing in the world is to lay out a man
bearing down on you with a club as it
happens i am not a j-j expert

  talkso had been an easy mark in the
road by mcgravs but he was something
else now he shoved the butt of the gun
the house of skulls	

into my stomach and when i doubled up
he slammed me over the skull with the bar-
rel then he swung up the gun for a finish-
ing stroke

  by this time i was just beginning to
realize that it was me for swift action or
the count and i came out of my dream
to be candid it is only in books that two
men get into a hot mix-up and follow the
queensbury rules with meticulous chivalry
in a real scrap of real men its hit hardest
with anything that will count

  i followed the most natural rules and
being backed against the stove i went
for talkso with an iron skillet that was
handy i ducked the gun banged him over
the ear and then swung the skillet on his
wrist he dropped the gun in a hurry and
to even matters i dropped the skillet and
began to finish off his education

  he knew something about fighting and
he tried to fight but that skillet had him
groggy from the start in about two min-
utes he was trying to get through the door
so i let him out-and hopped right after
him i caught him by the pump and
laid him out finely

  when he came to himself i had him
tied wrists and ankles with dust-cloths
from the car and was wasting good
mineral water pumping over his torso in
spite of all my kindness however he would
do nothing except splutter curses at me so
finally i tired of trying

   very well then lie here and talk to
yourself i stated in disgust when
the sheriff gets here maybe well learn a
few things

  i was dead right about that too

chapter x

i blild a wall

ox the morning after my encounter
with john talkso  was working
like a beaver on the skull wall in
front of my house i had been working
there since dawn

  in front of the wall i had a solid frame-
work of staked boards edge to edge six
inches from the walls face the end
spaces were closed with other boards

from the shore i had toted barrow-loads
of sand until my palms were blistered
and from the barn behind the house i
had brought a couple of sacks of cement
which had lain there unmolested for
lack of a mixing bed i was utilizing a de-
pression in the rock at the head of the
path bolders of all sizes were handy and
with these i had partially filled the space
in front of the wall enclosed by the
boards

   mixed my concrete rapidly and after
four or five batches had been shoveled
into the gap my work was done the
former face of the wall together with the
protruding skulls was nicely buried be-
hind six inches of concrete

  i was lighting my pipe and vastly ad-
miring my handiwork when i heard a
voice

   mercy what on earth is the matter
with your telephone here ive walked
all the way over here just to see if the
pterodactyl had eaten you up-

  it was martha j balliol flushed and
laughing

  hurray  exclaimed ive been
building a wail-sure the phone is
wrecked but i have a few things to
show you important things too come
up to the veranda and sit down while i
explain

   but are you a mason

   xo i said  im a pterodactyl-
and i can prove it

  when she was sitting in one of my porch
chairs which  placed in the middle of
the veranda floor i excused myself and
got the bucket and basket which john
talkso had left behind after departing on
the previous afternoon

   xow shut your eyes miss balliol
promise not to peep

   cross my heart she returned gaily

  i slowly crossed the floor to her then
stepped away a pace or two

   open

  her wondering gaze fell upon the con-
crete floor from the door of the living
room to the side of her chair extended a
line of fresh muddy pterodactyl tracks
she almost jumped then her blue eyes
went to me


all-story weekly

  exhibit a i said holding up the
bucket of muddy water and in the other
hand the plaster-of-iaris cast which had
made the tracks  john talkso was here
yesterday so was the sheriff talkso
left these things behind-and hes not
coming back

   her face sobered

  what do you mean mr desmond

    well  explained  this talkso was
an educated chap he knew what a
pterodactyl was you see-and he knew
that other men knew then he left some
other things typical of them was a set of
of twelve pieces of round crimson glass
these placed in the eyes of those skulls
made a fine crimson effcct when seen from
the lake you get the idea

   her eyes widened

  talkso that man but what about
my brother-

   im coming to that between the
sheriff and talkso we got the whole thing
straightened out yesterday afternoon
after telling her something of what had
happened i explained

    your brother miss balliol had pecu-
liar notions of what to do with indian
relics in building this house he un-
covered the so-called graves of the former
chiefs of the indian tribe which inhabited
this valley-and which still inhabits it in
places your brother used the skulls for
decoration and once set in that concrete
the skulls could not lie removed without
destroying the foundation wall of the house
you see

   she nodded watching me with eager ab-
sorption

    well i pursued  this john talkso
found out about it he cam after your
brother in a rage and there was a fight on
the spot in which talkso got worsted
then he set to work to drive your brother
off

   he invented some very clever stage
stuff such as the pterodactyl tracks and
the red glass in the skull-sockets he also
had some other tricks in his basket and all
of them clper he had managed to make
every one believe that this house was
haunted he had once or twice attempted
your brothers life-

    but why broke in the girl astounded

 whatever made the man act so was
he mad

   xot a bit of it he was sane he
was also well educated but-mark this-
he was not a white man he was a half-
breed indian and he was the last of the
indian chiefs in this particular valley he
had all the indians sense of outrage at
seeing the skulls of his forefathers orna-
menting this house so naturally he tried
to drive out the desecraters-your brother
and me

   he did not go in for murder in cold
blood yesterday he merely entered the
room behind you and gave you a shove
for example in general he contented him-
self with such things but when  met him
at mcgrays tavern and beat him up he
lost his head he hiked over another road
fr rn mcgrays a shorter road east of the
river and got here ahead of me but the
sheriff and another man were hunting and
they saw talkso deliberately ambush my
car it was assault with intent to kill
right enough and it meant the coop for
mr talkso

    but that wall you were building ex-
claimed martha balliol

    thats the sheriffs idea our sheriff is a
bright man i returned laughing  the
skulls you note are now buried complete-
ly yet the foundation of the house is not
damaged thus the feelings of john talkso
have been smoothed over particularly as
he faced the penitentiary if they were not
smoothed over he and his family are
rich ranchers across the lake and beyond
having him bounded lo keep the peace ill
not punish him further

   then you think-

   sure everythings all right

   a little later that day martha balliol
was bidding me farewell there was noth-
ing to keep her here further she said at
least she knew of nothing nor did i un-
happily she would go back east and take
up the broken threads again

    but i proffered  will you not let
me take you a far as lakeport

   it will be very kind mr desmond
of course
the house

of skulls



   its a promise i anxiously inquired
 word of honor

   eh the blue eyes inspected me with
surpse  why of course it is 

   good i lighted my pipe and puffed
contentedly  to tell you the truth the
car is useless-i failed to fix my tires
efficiently theres no gas to run the
launch on i forgot to fill up when we left
lakeport i was so excited over your ar-

 t h c

 rival naturally we do not want to walk
 so -miss balliol we must go by canoe

 by canoe she echoed  why-
lakeport is miles and miles away and i
cant paddle a stroke wed never get
there 

  well i said inquiringly

 she met my eyes slowly a rosy glow
 crept into her cheeks then she turned-
 and passed toward the canoc

end

preceding chapters brief l y ii e told

 captain alphels briggs of the clipper-ship silver flecco of new bedford a huge
 black-bearded bucko of the worst type even for the strenuous days of the old windjammers
 having stolen a malay girl kuala lahang at batu kawan refused pointblank lo give her up
 even though he knew the natives might rise and slaughter every white man on the ship

     even when the girls mother dengan jouga a nenck kabayan witch woman came on board
 and cursed him lie refused and drove her oil the ship and when his male protested the skipper
 in drunken rage beat him the mute scurlock accompanied by a cabin-boy he had rescued
 from the bucko skippers rage went ashore and the skipper who had been somewhat held in check
 by the diplomacy of the ships surgeon dr filhiol finally fell into a drunken sleep while he
 slept the second mate wansky took the ship out of batu kawan but not being familiar with the
 unchartcd coast ran ashore on a sand-spit in motomolo strait

     there the pursuing natives in nearly a score of boats overtook them the next day a parley
 ensued in which the malays demanded the girl on penalty ol instant death to scurlock and the
 boy whom they had in the boatwith them despite the near-mutiny of his white crew liriggs
 refused and the two were decapitated briggs then turned his small cannon on the boat

      the entire licet then attacked but briggs had the stolen girl brought on deck and threatened to
 ihrow her to the sharks swarming about the vessel if they didnt haul off they continued to
 approach however and briggs made good his threat the battle which followed was a desperate
 one but in the end all the native craft were sunk the silver fleece kedged off and with a deck
 full of dead and wounded she managed to escape ultimately reaching boston willi her rich cargo

      it was the i-sth of february s when ali this look place

     and now comes a lapse of fifty years-to the th of june iqis captain briggs had in the
 mean time fallen in love married and been wholly reformed by his gentle wife whom however
 he had lost at the birth of his first child this son also had been killed tragically in early man-
 hood and the daughter-in-law he had loved as his own was also taken but one object of his
 affection remained-his grandson hal a young man now and a replica-physically-of what the
 captain had been fifty years before it was for this grandson that he was waiting as lie sat on the
 veranda of his beautiful and peaceful home snug haven on the massachusetts coast age had
 not bowed the giant his hair and beard were now snow white and time had etched deep lines in
 his rugged face but he was still a vigorous and powerful man

     in the kitchen-or galley as they called it-ezra trefethen an ex-ships cook now his only
 companion and general factotum was singing a sea chanty when an old buggy drove up to the
 door and an old man hailed the captain it was dr filliiol now old and broken physically
 but as clear sighted as ever menlallv for long the two men talked of their lives-since neither
 had seen the other since the days of the silver fleece then as the captain sighted the schooner
 that was to bring hal from boston he made his old friend comfortable and hastened down lo
 the dock to meet the ship when it tied up

     and then-up from the cabin came what seemed lo be the ghost of himself at his worst-
 drunk raging in brutal unreasoning rage

   hal hal he entreated for gods
sake-

  once more hal threw the old man off
the seconds delay rescued mclaughlin
from annihilation dazed bleeding at
mouth and nose he staggered to his feet and
with good science plunged into a clinch with
the onrushing hal

  this unexpected move upset hals tactics
of sudden smashing violence the scots
long wiry arms wrapped round him con-
stricting him hampering his fist-work
hal could do no more than drive in harm-
less random blows at the others back
they swayed here there tripped over a
hawser almost went down from the crew
and from the spectators on the wharf ragged
shouts arose some of fear and anger some
of purely malicious delight and animal ex-
citement for here indeed was battle-royal
of the finest the airedale barking madly
added to the general tumult and the sound
of feet running down the wharf told of
other contingents hastily arriving to witness
the delectable scene

   by gum  approved the helmsman for-
getting to chew his quid he had more
than once felt the full weight of mclaugh-
lins fist  by gum now but macs in fr
a good takin-down if that lad dont fist
him proper i miss my tarnal guess sic
im boy

  blaspheming hal with a supreme effort
tore mclaughlin loose flung him back low-
ered his head and charged but now the
scot had recovered a little of his wit and
skill on deck he spat blood and a broken
snag of tooth his eye gleamed murderous-
ly the very excess of hals rage insen-
sate animal betrayed the boy his guard
opened in drove a stinging left-hander to
his ear mclaughlin handed him the other
fist packed full of dynamite the boy
reeled back gulping

  come on ye college bratlin chal-
lenged the fighting scot and smeared the
blood from his mouth with one swift pass of
the hand  this here aint your ship-not
yet

   my ships any ship i happen to be on
snarled hal circling for advantage macs
lesson had already taught him to be cau-
tious old captain briggss imploring cries

fell from him unheeded  if this was
my ship id wring your neck so help me
god but as it is ill only mash you to a
jelly

  pretty bairn gibed mclaughlin
hunched into battle-pose with bony fists up
and ready  grandads pretty pet come
here to uncle till  spank ye arrrh ye
would eh as hal bored in at him

  he met the attacking rush with judgment
and cool skill true hals right went to
one eye closing it but hal felt the bite of
knuckles catapulted from his neck in a
glancing blow that had it landed square
would almost have snapped the vertebra

  hal delayed for no more jockeying bull-
like he charged by sheer weight and fury
of blows he drove mac forward of the
schooner beside the deck-house amid the
turmoil of cries shouts cheers the battle
raged the jostling crowd swift-gathered
shoved and pushed on deck and on the
wharf to see this epic war half a dozen
bets were placed even money

  mclaughlin panting half-blind his
teeth set in a grin of rage only less savage
than hals put every ounce he had left into
each blow and into attempts to parry to
guard but hals greater weight and longer
reach outclassed him

   a minute two minutes they battled furi-
ously straining sweating lashing then
something swift and terrible connected with
macs jaw-point in a jolting jar that loos-
ened the universe and set the solar system
spinning in mad vortices macs head
snapped back his arms flung up he
dropped pole-axed into the-scuppers

years of fighting clean and dirty fergus
mclaughlin had taken a knockout

four of the crew came jostling into the cir-

back through the crowd the overbold ones
drew no heart remained in them to tackle
this infuriated fighting-machine

  wild mocking laughter rose unmerci-
ful gibes were chivvied at ihe quitters hal
set both fists on his hips flung up his head
and panted

  apologize will i i a passenger on
this lousy tub ill apologize to a bunch of
down-easi roughnecks eh if theres any-
body else wants any apology come on its
my little job to clean em out im here
none caught up the gage of battle
bursting with fury that had to vent itself
on some object hal swung toward mc-
laughlin the scot had landed on a coil of
hawser in the scuppers that had somewhat
broken the impact of his fall hal reached
down gripped him with gorilla strength
hauled him up and flung him backward over
the rail twice thrice he struck him with a
fist reddened by mclaughlins blood he
wrenched at the unconscious mans arm
snarling like an animal his face distorted
eyes glazed and staring a crunching
sound told of at least one broken bone

  shouts of horror of protestation fell un-
heeded from his ears

  my gawd hes a killin on him
quavered a voice  men all o ye-we cant
stan by an see him do murder

  old briggs nerved to sudden action ran
forward

   hal for gods sake hal

  you stand back grandad hes my
meat

   hal-

  before any one could intervene hal
raised mclaughlin high above his head
with a mingling sweep of wonderful power
roaring he dashed the scotchman to the
bare planks with a horrible dull crash
then he hauled back one foot and kicked
the senseless man full in the mangled
blood-smeared face

  a kind of communal gulp and gasp of
terror rose up then men shrank and quiv-
ered stricken with a kind of almost super-
stitious fear all had seen fights aplenty
most of them had taken a hand in brawls
and scuffles of more or less violence-
usually more-but here was a new kind of
malice a strange variety of passion and

silence fell more tense more heart-search-
ing than any tumult

  hal faced the outraged throng and
laughed with deep lungs

  	theres your champion whats left of
him cried he  lie wont bullyrag any-
body for one while believe me ive tamed
him for you take him-im through with
him 

  of a sudden ihe rage seemed to die in
hal as if spent in that last orgiastic con-
vulsion of passion he turned away flung
men right and left like children forced a
path for himself through them and leaped
down ihe companion swiftly he emerged
with a suitcase to his trembling half-
fainting grandfather he strode unmindful of
the low and ominous murmur of curses and
threats directed against him

  come on grandpop he said in an-
other and more normal tone his voice did
not tremble as will the voice of almost
even- man after a storm of rage his color
was fresh and high his eyes clear his whole
ego seemed to have been vivified and fresh-
ened like a sky after tempest  come
along now ive had enough of this rotten
old tub ive given it what it needed a
good clean-up come on 

  he seized captain briggs by the elbow-
for ihe old man could hardly stand and
now was leaning weakly against the hatch-
way housing-and half guided half dragged
him over the rail to the wharf

   shame on you hal briggs exclaimed
a leather-faced old lobsterman  this
heres a bad days work youve done when
he was down you booted him we wunt
fergit it none of us wunt

   xo and he wont forget it either the
bragging bucko sneered hal uncle
silas you keep out of this

   ef thats what they tarn ye down to
college sounded another voice from some-
where on the wharf  youd a durn sight
better stay to hum we fight some on the
north shore but we fight fair anyhow 

  hal faced around with blazing eyes

  	who said that he gritted  wheres
the son of a pup that said it

  xo answer came cowed everybody held
silence xo sound was heard save the shuf-
fling feet of the men aboard the sylvia
cursed



flctcher as some of the crew lifted mc-
laughlins limp form and carried it toward
the companion just as crevay had been
carried on the silver fleece half a century
before

  come on gramp exclaimed hal
again  for two cents id dean up the
whole white-livered bunch lets go home
now before theres trouble

   -im afraid i cant walk ha qua-
vered the old man  this has knocked me
galley-west my rudders unshipped and
my canvas in rags  cant navigate at all
he was trembling as with a chill against
his grandson he leaned shaken ashen-
faced helpless   cant make snug ha-
ven now

   thats all right grampy hal assured
him  we can dig up a jitney if you can
get as far as the street come on lets
move 

  with unsteady steps clinging to hals
arm and followed by the dog old captain
briggs made his way along hadlocks
wharf the way he had come only a few
minutes of time had elapsed since he had
strode so proudly down that wharf but what
a vast difference had been wrought in the
captains soul all the glad elation of his
heart which had shone forth from his eyes
and had irradiated his whole being had now
faded and vanished more swiftly than a
tropic sunset turns to dark the old man
seemed to have shrunken collapsed fallen
in his vigor his firm strength-where
were they now fifteen little minutes
seemed to have weighted and bowed down
his shoulders with at least fifteen years

  oh hal hal he groaned as they
slowly made their way toward the street
with a little straggle of curiosity-seekers
trailing after them  oh hal my boy
how could you ha done that

   how could i after what he said how
couldnt 

   what a disgrace what a burning
terrible disgrace you hal a briggs- just
back from college-

   there there grandpop itll be all
right everybodyll be glad when they
cool off that i handed it to that bully
proper

   this will make a terrible scandal the

observer will print it and maybe itll get
into the boston papers and-

   nonsense you dont think theyd
waste ink and paper on a little mix-up
aboard a coasting-schooner do you

   this is more than a little mix-up hal
youve stove that mans hull up serious
theres more storm brewing

   what dyou mean more storm

   oh hell take this to court hell sue
for damages and get them too

   hed better not  snapped hal grimly
 just let him try it ive got more for him
where what i handed him came from if he
tries it

   hal youre-breaking my old heart

   dyou think grandpa  was going to
stand there and swallow his insults do
you think i a briggs was going to let
that slab-sided p  hand me a bunch of
that rough stuff would you have stood
for it

   i what do you mean how could i
fight at my age

   i mean when you were young when
you were at sea didnt yon ever mix it
then didnt you have guts enough to put
up your fists when you had to if you
didnt youre no grandfather of mine

   hal answered the old man still hold-
ing to his grandson as they neared the
street  what course i sailed in my youth
is nothing for you to steer by now those
were rough days and these are supposed to
be civilized that was terrible terrible
what you did to mclaughlin the way you
flung him across the rail there and then
dashed him to the deck and-kicked him
when he was down-kicked him in the
face-

    its all right i tell you hal asserted
vigorously he laughed with glad remem-
brance  when  fight a gentleman i fight
like a gentleman when i fight a ruffian i
use the same tactics thats all such cattle
understand hed have done the same to
me if hed got a chance which he didnt
then and never will my motto is to hit
first every time thats the one best bet
the second is hit hard mean business

damn good rule you there hey there
jitney

  the discussion broke oil short as they
reached the end of the wharf and hal
sighted a little car cruising slowly and with
rattling joints over the rough-pavecl cobbles

thk captain commands

the jitney turned approached and
stopped

oh hello sami that you
asked hal recognizing the driver  how
are you

  hornspoon ef it aint hal ex-
claimed the jitney-man  hack agin eh
what the devil you been up to shirt
all tore an one eye looks like youd
been-

   oh nothing ha answered while the
taggers-on stopped at a respectful distance
gazing silently  ive just been arguing a
little with mclaughlin aboard the sylvia
fletcher its nothing at all he opened
the car door helped his grandfather in and
shoved the suit-case on to the hour of the
machine then gripping the airedale by
the scruff of its neck so that it yelped with
pain he pitched it in

 it was nothing nothing at all he re-
peated  how much more than that do
you want to take us down to snug haven
 well-thatll be a dollar n a half
seein its you

   youll get one nice round little buck
sam

   git out you an the capn an the
dog an a grip why- 

  hal climbed into the car sat down and
slammed the door he leaned forward his
face close to sams the seethe of rage
seemed to have departed xow hal was all
joviality good spirits friendliness swiftly
the change had come upon him

  sam he admonished you know
perfectly well seventy-five cents would be
robbery but ill give you a dollar-or
gramp will come put her into high and
lets be moving 

the driver sniffed hals breath raised his

eyebrows and nodded acceptance who
could resist hals smile

   all right seein as its you he an-
swered he added in a whisper  aint
got nothin on yr hip have ye

   nothing but a bruise said hal
 clk-clk

  the jitney growled forward and struck
its bone-shaking gait along the curving
street of endicutt xo one spoke the old
captain spent in forces and possessed by
strange hauntings bv bitter and terrible
thoughts had sun far down in the seat
his beard made a white cascade over the
smart blue of his brass-buttoned coat his
eyes half-closed seemed to be visioning the
other far-off wicked days that he had la-
bored so long and so hard to forget iiis
aged deep-lined face was gray with suffer-
ing bem ath its tan his lips from which
issued no word had set themselves in a
grim tight line

  as for hal he filled and lighted his pipe
then leaned back and with a kind of bored
tolerance eyed the quaint old houses the
shops the gardens and trim hedges

   some burg he murmured  some
live little burg to put in a whole summer
here and at south endicutt well anyhow
 started something theyve got some-
thing to talk about for a while they
ought to hand me a medal for putting a lit-
tle ginger into this prehistoric graveyard
then he relapsed into contemplative
smoking

  in silence they rattled along presently
the town thinned out giving place to the
open road along the shore now bathed in a
thousand lovely hues as sunset died the
slowly fading beauty of the seascape
soothed and quieted what little fever still
remained in hals blood with an appre-
ciative eye he observed the harbor the
town itself might seem a dreary place but
in his soul the instinctive love and compre-
hension of the sea awoke to the fresh
charms of that master-panorama which in
all the history of its infinite existence has
never iwice shown just the same blending of
hues of motion of refluent ebb and fall

  along the dimming islands the incoming
swells were breaking into great bouquets of
foam the murmurous watery cry of the
cursed -



surf lulled hal its hollow and booming ca-
dences against the rocky girdles of the coast
seemed whispering strange alluring mys-
terious things to him in the offing a lew
faint specks of sail melting in the purple
haze beckoned come away come
away

    lord muttered hal shifting uneasily
 how mu i stick it out all summer here
with grampy when that unit is calling
me

  to captain briggs quite other thoughts
were coming than those of sky anil sea xot
now could the lure of his well-loved ocean
appeal to him for all the wonders of the
umber and dull orange west where but an
hour ago beauty had spread its miracles
across die world for him now all had
turned to drab and dun here and beyond
a few faint twinkles of light were beginning
to show in fishers cottages ami these too
saddened the old captain for they minded
him of snug havens waiting lights snug
haven where he had hoped so wonderfully
much of the home-coming but where now-
onlv mournful disillusion and foreboding
thoughts of evil remained

   the ceaseless threnody of the sea against
the shore now and then audible above the
purr of the engine and the whirring spin of
the tires seemed to the old man a requiem
over dead hopes the salt tides seemed to
mock and jibe at him with malice and out
of the pale haze that drifted upward sea-
ward from the slow-heaving waters ghosts
seemed to be beckoning wraith- and spec-
ters of the long-dead past

   all at once hal spoke hi slangy college
vernacular rudely jarring on the old cap-
tains melancholy

   that was some jolt i handed mac
wasnt it he laughed  he wont be so
careful who he picks on thatll do him a
needed a good walloping

  eh what  murmured the old man
roused from his sad m usings

   such people have to get it handed to
them once in a while the grandson con-
tinued  theres only one kind of argu
ment they understand and that- this
kind 

   he raised his right list and by the lading
light inspected it turning it this way and

    	a-s

that admiring its massive power its ada-
mantine bone and sinew

  	oh for heavens sake hal dont do
that exclaimed the captain startled
with strange eyes he peered at the young
man

  he laughed uproariously

   some fist what- he boasted  some
pacifier makes you nervous eh

  as he turned toward the old man his
breath smote the captains senses

    lord hal you havent been drinking
have you quavered briggs with tear-
stricken accents

  drinking well no maybe ive had
one or two but thats all

    one or two what hal

   siugs of rum

   rum good god

   whats the matter now whats the
harm in a drop of good stimulant you see
mac had some extra fine rum in his cabin
as a passenger i thought there was a little
coming to me lts chilly out at sea
damned chilly grandpop you know that
yourself so  asked him for a drink and
lie couldnt see it the tightwad  took it
anyhow thats what started all the rough-
house

  great heavens hal d you mean to
tell me youre drinking now

   there there gramp dont get all
stewed up over a trifle all the fellows
in my set at college lake a drop now and
then you dont want me to be a molly-
coddle do you and drink nothing stronger
than warm milk  you dont want me to
feel i can t take a nip once in a while and
not hold it like a gentleman thats all
foolishness grampy be sensible

  the old man began to shiver though not
with cold for die off-shore breeze blew
warm and llower-scented hal made a
grimace of displeasure and vexation his
grandfather answered nothing and once
more silence fell between the two it lasted
til the first scattering houses of south endi
vutt came into view in the fading light and
until the car slowing a little rattled into
tiie rock-studded street that sinuously
wound along the shore

  the driver throwing a switch sent the
beams of his headlights piercing the soft

june dusk the cones of radiance painted
the roadside grass a vivid green and made
the white-washed fences leap to view the
hedges gardens gable-ends of the old
houses all spoke of home and rest of com-
fort peace and the beatitude of snug secur-
ity somewhere the sound of childrens
shouts and laughter a- they played hide-
and-seek echoed appealingly the tinkle of
a cow-bell added its musical note and faint
in the western sky the evening star looked
down upon the darkling sea

  then came the turn in the road a little
red gleam winked in view-the port light of
the haven

   theres the old place just the same
isnt it commented hal in a softer tone
for a moment he seemed moved to gentler
thoughts but only for a moment his eye
catching a far white figure away down by
the smithy brightened with other anticipa-
tions than those of getting home again

   hello he exclaimed  thats laura
isnt it look gramp-isnt that laura
maynard

  peering ahead captain briggs recognized
the girl he understood her innocent little
subterfuge of being out for a casual stroll
just at this time when hal was coming
home his heart already lacerated con-
tracted with fresh pain

   no no hal he exclaimed  that
cant be laura that must be susan cald-
well-you know ed caldwells wife come
now dont be thinking about laura to-
night youve had a hard day of it youre
tired and ought to rest

   tired me tired say thats a good
one when was i ever tired

   well im tired anyhow the captain
insisted  and  want to cast anchor at the
haven weve got company too and i
want you to come right in it wouldnt
look polite if you went gallivanting-

   company what company de-
manded hal as the car slackened still more
drawing up toward the gate

   a very special friend of mine an-
swered the captain  a man i havent seen
in fifty years an old doctor that once
sailed with me hes waiting to see you
now

    another old pill eh growled the boy

sullenly his eyes still fixed on the girl at the
bend of the road  therell be time
enough for methuselah later just now
its me for the skirt

  the car halted at the irate captain
briggs opened the door ruddy the aire-
dale leaped out and stood expectant grin-
ning and panting as dogs do when well
pleased the captain stiffly descended forc-
ing himself to greater activity than his
weariness dictated he felt singularly spent
and old hal threw out the suit-case and
lithely leaped to earth

   dig up a bone for sam here directed
hal  xow ill be on my way to overhaul
the little dame

 hal thats not laura i tell you
you cant kid me grampy thats the
schoolmam all right id know her a mile
off shes some chicken take it from me
hal  protest against such language
about that line young woman 

   oh too rough eh sneered the boy
 now in your day  suppose you used
more refined english didnt you maybe
you called them qualified wenches or-
ilal that will do

   so will laura for me shes mine that
girl is shes plump as a young porpoise
and im going to go after her 

  the captain stood aghast at sound of
words that echoed from the very antipodes
of the world and of his own life then with
a sudden rush of anger his face reddening
formidably he exclaimed

   not another word youve been drink-
ing and youre dirty and torn youve got
rum aboard you sir-youre no fit man to-
night to haul up longside that craft 

   i tell you im going down there to say
good evening to laura anyhow hal in-
sisted sullenly dont be so buttinskv
im going

  you are not sir retorted briggs
while sam in the car grinned and nodded
with enjoyment of this verbal war that
would make choice pickings for gossip all
along the village  youre not going to hail
laura maynard to-night im ashamed of
you do you want to lose her friendship
and respect

   pifile women like a little rough stuff
now anil then i liis little kolb business is
cu rski



played out lo along in if you want to
hut im going to see iaura

   hal said the old man a new tone in
his voice  this is carrying too much can-
vas youll lose some of it in a minute if
you dont reef im captain here and youre
going to lake my orders if it comes to that
im paying your way through college sir
every bite you eat and every stitch you
wear comes from me the very strength
you boast of and misuse so brutally is ile
river from money i worked a lifetimefor ai
sea and suffered and sinned and bled and
almost died for the old mans tin- rang
out again as in the old tempestuous days
when he was master of many hard and vio-
lent men  now sir youre aboard my
craft and ini your sailing-master youre
going to obey me or overside you go this
minute and once you go youll never set
foot on my planks again pick up your
dunnage sir and into the haven with
you

   good nightejaculated hal staring
sever once before in all his life had the
old man the sou of kindly indulgence
spoken to him thus astonished though
hal was and stung to anger he recognized
a power he dared not disobey muttering
he picked up the suit-case ruddy glad to
be at home once more set up a joyful bark-
ing and leaped against him with an oath
hal swung the suit-case the airedale yelp-
ing again with pain cringed fawned and
slunk away

   into the haven with you  commanded
briggs outraged and indignant to his very
heart  go

  hal obeyed slouching through the gate
with huge shoulders hulking and drooping
in their plentitude of evil power just as the
captains had done so very long ago
alpheus briggs peered down the street a
moment at the dim white figure of the dis-
appointed girl then exes agleam and back
very straight he followed hal up the white-
sanded walk toward snug haven - the
haven which in such beatitude of spirit he
had left but an hour ago the haven to
which tilled with so many fears and evil
bodings he now was coming back again

   oh god he murmured as he went
 if this thing must come upon me thy

will be done but if it can be turned aside
spare me spare me for this is all my life
and all m hope spare me

chapter xxl

slkctkks or tiik past

hals boots clumping heavily up the
steps of the porch aroused the cap-
tain from his brief revery of prayer- -
a prayer wrung from him by excess of
anguish captain briggs despite all his
many virtues was not a pious man xeither
did he often pray his faith in a personal
iod was tenuous perhaps being more than
anything else a kind of love and reverence
for land and sky and sea for all of xatures
universal and eternal miracles yet in this
moment ol distress the age-old formula the
cry for help to some unknown and over-
brooding power framed itself upon his lips

  that cry was only momentary almost
at once the new swift stab of pain he felt
at realizing that dr filhiol must see the
grandson in this disheveled half-drunken
condition brought the old man sharply back
to earth again how bitter a humiliation
this-to have extolled the boy and praised
him in so many ways and then to have this
brutal disillusionment this sickening anti-
climax the captain stiflecf a groan fate
seemed indeed to be dealing him a blow
unreasonably hard

  a chair scraped on the porch by the
dim light through the windows of the
cabin briggs saw the bent and shriveled
form of dr filhiol arising the good doc-
tor rendered a bit nervous by the formida-
ble arsenal of weapons over the fireplace
and by the cabinet of curios which all too
clearly recalled the past had once more-
issued out upon the piazza to await the
captains return warmed by the egg-nogg
within and outwardly by a shawl that ezra
had given him- a shawl wrapped about his
lean crooked body so that to speak truth
he much resembled a wizen old woman
now he stood there waiting leaning on his
cane  smile of anticipation curved his
shaven bloodless lips his eyes blinked
eagerly behind his thick-lensed glasses

  	home again eh he piped good

so then this is hal this is the little grand-
son back from college little ha-ha
why captain hed make two like us

   this is hal answered the captain
briefly and also climbed the steps strangely
weary  yes this is my grandson

   the doctor a little surprised at briggss
curt reply put out his hand hal took it
as his grandfather spoke the doctors name

   glad to know you doctor said he in
a sullen voice and let the hand drop  ex-
cuse me please ill go in and wash up

  he turned toward the door with per-
turbation filhiol peered after him then
he glanced at the captain an awkward
silence fell it was broken by a cry of joy
from the front door

  oh master hal ejaculated ezra
 ef it aint master llal

   the faithful old servitors long leathery
face beamed with jubilation as he seized
the suit-case with one hand and with the
other clapped hal on the shoulder  jump-
in jellyfish but youre lookin fine n
stout back from yr books aint ye ah
books is grand things master hal specially
check-books pocketbooks an bank-books
did the capn tell ye he did didnt he

  hello ez answered hal still very
glum  tell me what

   bout the plum-cake an lamb asked
ezra anxiously as hal slid past him into
the house

   no

   didnt eh said he would though
the ancient mariners tone expressed keen
disappointment  but its all right any-
how i remembered what you like master
hal i been workin dog-gone hard to git
everythin jest at fc-r you

  his voice sank to a mumble and grew
inaudible as he followed hal into snug
haven the captain and the doctor left
alone gazed at each other a long eloquent
moment in the vague light neither spoke
filhiol turned hobbled back to his chair
and sat down puzzled and oppressed

  briggs drew up another chair and sank
into it wearily the sound of hal s feet
stumbling up the front stairs echoed with
torment through his soul was that the
stumbling of haste or had the boy drunk
more than he had seemed to the captain

took off his cap and let it fall to the porch-
floor not now did he take pains to hang
it meticulously on top of the rocking-chair
he wiped his forehead with his silk hand-
kerchief its gay colors now incongruous
and groaned

  the doctor with courteous delicacy of
feeling kept silence he understood that
any word of his would prove inopportune
but with pity and deep concern he studied
the face of captain briggs its lines accentu-
ated by the light that shone out through
the window of the cabin

  presently the captain sighed deep and
began

   im glad youre here on my quarter-
deck with me to-night doctor youre the
one man id have chosen to be aboard with
me things are all going wrong sir very
wrong barometers way down compass is
bedeviled and seams are opening fore and
aft its bad doctor-very very bad

    see theres something wrong of
course said filhiol with sympathy  i
couldnt help seeing that

   everythings wrong sir that grand-
son of mine-you-noticed just what was
the matter with him

   h-m its rather dark here you know
hedged filhiol unwilling to hurt the feelings
of his old-time companion

   not so dark but what you understood
said briggs grimly  its no use blinking
facts when theres a storm brewing no
good navigator thinks he can dodge it by
locking himself in his cabin and there is
a storm brewing this time a hurricane sir
or ive missed all signals

   just what do you mean captain

   violence drink women - wickedness
and sin

   eh what

   you smelled his breath didnt you
you took an observation of his face

   well yes hes been drinking a little
of course but maybe not a very great deal
these boys in college-

   hes been drinking enough sir so that
he very nigh killed the skipper of the sylvia
fletcher and therell be the devil to pay
about it it was just luck there wasnt
murder done before my very eyes hes
been drinking enough so as to wake up a
trskd



black devil in his heart enough so hes
like a roaring bull after the first pretty girl
hesights in the offing

  there there captain the doctor
tried to soothe him his thin and piping
voice making a strange contrast with the
captains booming bass  youre probably
exaggerating a little exuberance may be
pardoned in youth he tried to speak re-
assuringly but his expression belied his
words  remember captain when you
were

   	thats just whats driving me on the
rocks with grief and despair the old man
burst out gripping the arms of the rocker
his face by the light through the window
had set itself into a mask of agony god
above its just the realization of my own
youth flung back at me now diats like to
kill me chat boy doctor that boy so
help me- why hes thrown clean back fifty
years all at one dip

    xo no not that

    he has  tell you in deed and word
and thought hes jumped back half a cen-
tury h dont belong in this age of air-
planes and wireless and ail that he be-
longs back with the dipper-ships and with
the-

    thats all nonsense captain and you
know it 

    its far from nonsense doctor theres
a bad strain somewhere in my blood ive
been afraid a long time it was going to
crop out in hal but  havent said any-
thing theres always been a tradition in
my family of rough and evil doings now and
then i dont know anything certain about
it though except that my grandfather
amalfi rriggs died of bursting a blood-
vessel in his brain when he was in a fit of
rage that was all that saved him from
being a murderer he died before he could
kill the other man

   silence came silence save for the piping
whistle of some urchin far up the road that
branched to northward round croft hill
-some homeward-bound urchin tunefully
keeping up his spirits as he passed the
cemetery the ever-rising falling suspira-
tion of the sea breathed its long caress
across the land on which a vague pale
sheen of starlight was descending

  suddenly from above stairs sounded a
dull skimming sound as of a bureau-drawer
violently banged shut another slam fol-
lowed and now came a grumbling that
could lie no other than muffled profanity

   all that saved my grandfather from
being hung as a murderer said briggs
dourly  was the fact that he dropped
dead himself before he could cut down the
other man with the ship-carpenters adze he
had in his hand that was a close shave
our fainily-tree had if the old carpenter
had lived another five seconds wed have
had one branch on it anyhow labeled
murder

   yes thought the doctor  and youd
have added another if anything out east
had ever been known about you but
stifling that uncharitable thought under the
ashes of long-dead years he answered only

   indeed your grandfather so it seems
must have been rather a hard specimen

   only when he was in anger at other
times you never saw a more jovial soul
but rage made a beast of him

   haw was your father

  	xot that way in the least he was as
good as upright and consistently christian
a man as ever breathed my son-hals
father was a good man loo normal and
even-tempered xot a sign of that sort of
brutality ever showed in him

    i think youre worrying unnecessarily
judged the doctor - your grandson may-
be wild untamed and rough at times but
hes tainted with  hereditary stain

     dont know about that doctor i
wish i could believe it said the captain
earnestly  for a year or two past hes
been showing more temper now and then
than a young man should lies not been
answering the helm very well ihcresbcen
a little minor trouble about it two or
three of the village people here have already
complained to me but ive never been
really afraid till to-night xow doctor
now i am afraid- terribly deadly afraid

  the old mans voice shook under the
weight and stress of his emotion filhiol
tried to smile

    youre needlessly disturbing yourself
said he - let the dead past bury its dead
dont open the old graves to let the ghosts


all-story weekly

of other clays walk out again into the clear
sunset of your life

   god knows i dont want to the old
man exclaimed in a low trembling voice
 but doctor suppose those graves open
themselves suppose they wont stay shut
no not though all the good deeds from here
to heaven were piled atop of them to keep
them down suppose those ghosts rise up
in spite of everything that i can do and
stare me in the eyes and wont be banished
-what then

  stuff and nonsense gibed iilhiol
though his voice was far from steady
 youre not yourself captain you and
hal have been quarreling and youre both
unnerved theres nothing the matter with
that boy except high spirits and overflowing
animal passions

  no no i understand only too well
what hals in for-what im in for god
is being very hard to me  sinned and
sinned grievous in the long ago we both
understand that but ive done my very
best to pay the reckoning seems like 
havent succeeded in paying seems like
god dont forget hes paying me now
with interest

  captain you exaggerate the doctor
tried to assure him but briggs only shook
his head

   it skips that way sometimes dont it
asked he  heredity skips that way

   well-sometimes its been known to
happen but of course that doesnt prove
anything

   no it dont prove anything but what
hal did to-night docs

   youre borrow ing a lot of unnecessary
trouble captain the boy may be irascible
combative and rough i tell you he may
even drink a little a great many young
men do but-

   would a thing like that come on sud -
den that way demanded briggs paying
no heed to the doctors platitudes obviously
forced and insincere  would it that
kind of a mad hydrophobia of rage that
wont listen to any reason but wants to
break and tear and kill i mean if that
kind of thing was in the blood could it lay
hid a long time and then all of a sudden
burst out like that

   well- yes it might but why do you
assume-

   i seem to remember it was the same
with me the first time  ever had one of
those mad fils said the captain  it came
on quick it wasnt like ordinary getting
mad it was a red torrent insane delirious
and awful -something that caught me up
and carried me along on its wave-some-
thing  couldnt any more have fought
against than a dory could keep from going
ashore in the surf of an easterly hurricane
when  saw hal with his teeth grinning and
his eyes glassy and his lists red with mc-
laughlins blood oh it struck clean through
my heart

   it wasnt any fear of either of them
getting killed that harpooned me it wasnt
fear of complications and damages to pay
no no ihuiilh such will be bad enough
what struck me all of a heap what wrung
me out and drained me dry was to see my-
self my very own self that used to be if
i captain alpheus briggs had been swept
back lo t sos and set down on the deck of
the silver fleecc hal would have been my
exact double ive seen myself just as i
was then doctor and its shaken me in
every timber there i stood i myself in
hals person after five decades of weary
time i could sec the outlines of the same
black beard on the same kind of jaw-same
thick neck and bloody fists and oh doctor
the eyes of  ini his eyes 

   his eyes

   yes in them i saw my old wicked
hell-elected self saw it glaring out to
break and ravish and murder

   captain briggs 

  its true im telling you theres no
exaggeration in it and no lie ive seen a
ghost this evening a ghost-

  he peered round fearfully in the dusk
his voice low ered to a whisper

   a ghost he repeated

  filhiol could not speak something cold
prehensile terrible seemed fingering at his
heart ruddy the airedale raised his
head seemed to be listening to be seeing
something the- could not detect in the
dogs throat a low growl muttered 

   whats that said the captain every
muscle taut
cl rski



    nothing nothing the doctor answered
  the dog probably hears some one down
 there by the hedge this is all nonsense
 captain youre working yourself into a
 highly nervous state and imagining all kinds
 of things now

      i tell you i saw the ghost of my other
 self on the decks of the sylvia fletcher
 insisted briggs  theres worse kinds of
 ghosts than those that hang round grave-
 yards in white robes ive always wanted
 to see that kind and never have succeeded
 night after night ive been up there lo the
 little cemetery on croft hill and leaned
 over the wall or gone inside and sat on the
 bench in our lot just as friendly like and
 receptive as could be waiting and ready t
 see whatever ghost might come to me hut
 none ever came im not afraid of the
 ghosts of the dead its ghosts of the liviinr
 that strike a dread lo me ghosts of tin-
 past that ought to die and cant -ghosts of
 my own sins that god wont lei lie in the
 grave of forgiveness
  s--i-i exclaimed the doctor lie
 leaned forward and laid a hand on the cap-
 tains which was clutching the arm of the
 rocker with a grip of steel  i beg of you
 my friend i entreat you dont give way to
 such folly perhaps hal did drink a little
 and perhaps he did do what any high-
 spirited youth would do if he could- whip
 a man who had insulted and tormented him
 but thats as far as it goes all this talk
 about ghosts and about some hereditary
 devilish force cropping out again is pure
 rubbish

    i wish to god above ii i   the old
 man groaned  but  know its not 
 know its there doctor its there  tell
 you its still alive and in the world more
 terrible and more malignant than ever a
 living breathing thing evil and venomous
 hacked up with twice the intelligence and
 learning i ever had with a fine keen brain
 to direct it and with muscles of steel to do
 its bidding oh god i know i know

    captain briggs sir the doctor began
 this is most extraordinary language from
 a man of your common sense  really d
 not understand 

    hush  interrupted the captain raising
 his right hand on the stairway feet

 echoed descending - hush hes coming
 down

   silent tense they waited he heavy
 footfalls reached the bottom of the stair and
 paused there a moment briggs and the
 doctor heard hal grumbling something in-
 articulate to himself then he walked into
 the cabin

chaptfr xxii

lk iiihim stands hy

through the window that gave upon
the porch both men could see him
though they themselves in shadow
were hardly visible to him the cabin-lamp
over the captains table shed soft rays upon
the boy as he stood there unconscious of
being observed

   he remained motionless a moment gaz-
 ing about him as one gazes at a familiar
 place after long absence taking account of
 the room and of any little changes that had
 been wrought there in the past months at
 sight of him the old captain despite all his
 hodings of evil could not but thrill with
 pride and admiration of this clean-limbed
 powerful-shouldered grandson scion of the
 old stock last survivor of his race and hope
 of all its future existence

   hal took a step or two forward to the
 table the lithe ease and grace and power
 of his stride impressed the doctors critical
 eye

   lies all right enough captain said
 filhiol in a low tone  theres nothing the
 matter with him hes as normal as can he
 hes just as fve already told you-a case
 of overflowing animal spirits strength and
 energy iord what wouldnt  give to be
 like that what wouldnt you again

   i wouldnt stand in those boots of his
 for all the money in lloyds returned the
 captain in a hoarse whisper his left hand
 was holding hard to the arm of the chair
 his right was stroking his white beard
 sure sign of perturbation  not for all the
 money in the world sir for look you
 doctor i have lived my life and got wisdom
 my fires have burned low leaving the ashes
 of peace or so i hope but that lad there
 ah theres fires and volcanoes enough


all-story weekly

 ahead for him i warrant you maybe those
 same fires will kindle up my ashes too and
 sear my heart and soul maybe there is
 no peace for me  thought after the life-
 journey ive sailed i was entitled to heave
 anchor and lay in harbor a spell till  get
 my papers for the unknown port we dont
 any of us come back from but maybe im
 mistaken maybe thats not to be doctor
 after all

   what rubbish for a sane man to talk
retorted iilhiol still speaking very low
 look at him now will you isnt he
quiet peaceful and normal enough for any-
body see there now hes going to take a
book and sit down and read it like any
well-behaved young man

   any well-behaved young man would
come out here on the quarter-deck and talk
to his skipper that he hasnt seen for six
months and to the guest aboard the craft
declared the captain  ah well i mustnt
hope for everything if hell only furl sail
now and keep off the rocks for a while
thats about all  can expect

  hal had indeed taken a book from the
captains table and had sat down with it in
the big chair before the fireplace he did
not however open the book instead he
leaned back and gazed intently up at the
arsenal displayed against the cobblestones
he frowned nodded and then broke into a
peculiar smile his right fist clenched and
rose as if in imagination he were gripping
one of those weapons with fergus mc-
laughlin in all probability as his immediate
target

  a little silence fell once more through
which faintly penetrated the far-off nasal
minor of old ezra now as he made the
final preparations for supper engaged upon
an endless chantey recounting the life and
adventures of one  boney  - alias na-
poleon bonaparte for a minute peace
seemed to have descended upon snug
haven but only for a minute once more
it was hal who destroyed it

  for all at once with an oath of impa-
tience he flung the book crumpled to the
floor he stood up thrust both hands deep
into his trouser-pockets and fell to pacing
the floor in a temper obviously poisonous

  of a sudden he stopped wheeled toward

the captains little private locker built into
a corner of the cabin near the wall-safe and
strode to it the locker door was secured
with a brass padlock of unusual strength
hal took the padlock between thumb and
fingers and twisted it off as easily as if it
had been made of putty he flung open
the locker door peered at the shelves a
moment and then took down a bottle

  he pulled the cork seized a tumbler and
slopped it leveiful of whisky which he
gulped without a wink then he smeared
his mouth with the back of his hand and
stood there evil-eyed and growling

   puh thats rotten stuff he ejacu-
lated  crandpop certainly does keep a
punk line of stuff here back upon the
shelf he slammed the bottle and the glass
wonder where that smooth jamaicas gone
he used to have

   god above did you see that doctor
breathed the old captain gripping at the
doctors hand  he downed that like so
much water isnt that the exact way i
used to swill liquor by judas priest fll
soon put a stop to ml

  he would have risen bent on instantly
precipitating the issue with hal but filhiol
restrained him

  wait he cautioned as the two old
men leaned forward in their chairs peering
in unseen through the window  even
that sort of drinking doesnt prove the in-
nate depravity and original sin you seem
so determined to lav at the boys door hes
tired and unnerved after his fight with mc-
laughlin when  used to go through a
severe siege in the active days of my work
-after a trying operation or what not-
sometimes i ve taken some pretty stiff
drinks myself lets see what hell do next
if were going to judge him accurately
weve got to watch a while

  old briggs sank back into his chair and
with eyes of misery followed the boy idol
of all his love hope of all his dreams hals
next move was not long delayed

   ezra they heard him call in a harsh
imperative voice  you ezra come
here

  the chantey of the life and adventures
of x bonaparte came to a sudden end in
the galley a moment and ezra appeared
cursed



in the doorway leading from the cabin to
the dining-saloon

   well master hal what is it smiled
the cook beaming with affection and with
pleasurable anticipation of the treat he
was just now laying on the table for his
cherished hal ezra looked the part of sea-
cook to perfection apron cap and all
were quite correct and in one hand he held
a  copper just such as aboard the silver
fleece had heated water for the scalding of
the batu kawan folk  what dvou want
master hal

   look here ezra  said the boy ar-
rogantly  ive been trying to find the rum
that grandpop always keeps in there he
jerked a thumb at the locker  couldnt
locate it so ive been giving this whisky a
trial and-

   when whisky an young men lay long-
side one another the whisky dont want a
trial it wants lynchiiv the old cooks
tone was of stern reproval

  thatll do for you im not asking
your opinion  sneered hal

   yes but fm givin it master hal
persisted ezra advancing into the cabin
 when the devil goes fishin fer boys he
sticks a petticoat an a bottle o rum on the
hook

   get me the jamaica you wheres the
old jamaica demanded hal with growing
anger  ive got no time for your line of
bull

   lots that aint got no time for nothin
in this world will have time to burn in the
next youll get no rum from me master
hal an whats more if id ha thought
you was goin to slip your cable an run
ashore in any such dognation fool way on
a wave o booze first thing you come home
id of hid the whisky where you wouldnt
of run it down 

   youd have hidden it echoed hal his
face darkening the veins on neck and fore-
head beginning to swell  youve got the
infernal nerve to stand there-you a serv-
ant-and tell me youd hide anything away
from me in my own house

    this here craft is registered under your
grandpas name an is sailin under his
house-flag the old cook reminded him
his face was still bland and leathery as

ever but in his eyes lurked a queer little
gleam  it aint the same thing at all-
not yet

    damn your infernal lip shouted hal
advancing toward him captain briggs
quivering in every fiber half-rose from his
chair and was restrained from pegging away
into the house only by the doctors hand
 youve got the damned impudence to
stand there and-and dictate to me

    master hal retorted ezra with won-
derful with admirable self-restraint you
are goin too far young man you are sail-
in a bit too wide o your course now
theres breakers ahead sir look out

     believe youve been at the square-face
of jamaica yourself you thieving son of
satan snarled hal you and your
sniveling platitudes make me sick ill not
stand here parleying with a servant get
me that jamaica now or ill break your
damned obstinate neck

   now master hal i warn you-

    to hell with you

    with me master hal with old ezra
 with everything that stands in my
way 

   despite hals furious rage the steadfast
old sailorman still resolutely faced him
captain briggs now again hearing almost
the identical words he himself had poured
out in the cabin of the silver fleece at
batu kawan sank back into his chair with
a strange throaty gasp

    doctor  he gulped  hear that do
you hear that

    wait s-li-lt-h the doctor cautioned
leaning forward  this is very strange
it is by jove sir some extraordinary
psychological parallel some amazing coin-
cidence or-

    next thing you know hell knock ezra
down  whispered the captain staring he
seemed paralyzed incapable of movement
as though tranced by the scene now being
acted in the cabin of snug haven as on a
stage  thats what i did to the cabin-
boy or tried to when my run was wrong
remember its all coming round again
doctor its a nightmare in a circle - a
fifty-year circle remember kuala pahang
she-she died i wonder what womans
got to die this time


all-story weekly

   thats all pure poppycock the doctor
ejaculated lnu his words sounded none too
sure he was trembling in i violent nerve-
crisis with a great effort leaning heavily
on his stick he arose captain briggs loo
shook off the spell that seemed to grip him
and stood up

  hal he tried to call but his voice
failed him lie could produce no more than
a choking gasp turning he lurched to-
ward he front door

  from within sounded a cry came a
trampling noise something clattered to the
floor

  hal my god hal the captain
shouted hoarsely his voice returning under
siress of terrible emotion

  as he reached the door ezra came stag-
gering out into the hall a hand pressed to
his face

   ezra what is it choked the captain
 whats he done for heavens sake
ezra whats hal done to you

  for a moment the old man could make no
answer limply he sagged against the
newel-post a pitiful sorry picture of grief
and pain the captain reached him put
an arm about his shoulders and with burn-
ing indignation cried

   what did he do hit you

  ezra shook his head in stout negation
even through all the shock and suffering of
the blow that hal had dealt him his loyalty
remained sublimely constant

   hit me why no sir he tried to
smile though his lips were white and tremu-
lous  he wouldnt strike old ezra master
hal wouldnt theres no mutiny or war
aboard this little craft of ours two gentle-
men may disagree an all that but as fer
master hal strikin me no sir

   but i heard him say
 oh thats nothin capn the old cook
insisted still however keeping hi- cheek-
bone covered with his hand  boys will be
boys an some of em git a leetle mite sassy
now an then theyre a bit loose with their
jaw-tackle maybe but there there dont
you git all harred up captain men an
pins is jest alike that way-no good ef they
lose their heads cam down capn
master hal didnt mean nothin by what he
said xot a thing in this world sir 

  	what - thai on your face ezra

blood git on my dog-gone face anyhow
thats- h-m  

   dont you lie to me ezra im not
blind he struck you didnt he he cut

old salt persisted with brazen determina-
tion  i admit we had a bit of an argy-
ment an i slipped an kind of fell agin
the the binnacle capll now thats the
livin truth so help me i swear that 
the ships bible

   dont you stand there and perjure your
immortal soul just to shield that boy
briggs sternly reproved him loving the old
man all the more for the brave lie  don
you do it sir but  know you will any-
how what authority have i got aboard my
own ship these days when  cant even
get the truth ezra you wouldnt admit it
you wouldnt own up to it if hal took that
kris in there and cut your head off

   iiow could i then sir

   that  do pzra where is he now

    i dont know sir

  ill damn soon find out the captain
exclaimed stung to the first profanity of
years he turned from ezra and tramped
into the cabin fists clenched face terrible
with anger

    come here sir  he cried in a tone that
never before had been heard in snug
haven

  xto answer hal was not there xeither
was the bottle of whisky that too had
disappeared evidently snatched from the
locker shelf when hal had departed a
chair had been tipped over and on the
floor lay the captains most cherished pos-
session hi- wonderful chronometer face-
down and with shattered glass in the
struggle whatever it had been that precious
thing had been struck from the mast that
rose beside the captains table

  this destruction joined to the sight of
ezras innocent blood seemed to freeze the
captains narrow he stood there quite mo-
tionless a moment staring then wide-
eyed he peered round

   mutiny and bloodshed he whispered
cursed



 mutiny and blood aboard my craft god
deliver us from whats to be

  at sight of the open door leading into
the dining-saloon his bushy white brows
contracted thither hal must have re-
treated the captain terrible in wrath
strode through the open door

  hal briggs sir he called crisply
 come here

  a creaking of the back stairs constituted
the only answer into the galley the cap-
tain hurried and up those stairs as he
reached the top he heard the door of hals
room shut and the key turn

  to the door he stamped a figure of
avenging indignation

   you sir he cried knocking violently
at the panels

  only silence answered him he knocked
again a voice issued

   its no use gramp im not coming
out and youre not coming in its been
nothing but hell one way or another ever
since i struck this damn place it began
with mclaughlin picking on me and every-
body else seems to be keeping it up if it
doesnt stop im going to get mad and do
some damage round here and that goes

i dont want any of ezras lamb and plum-
cake what does he think i am anyhow a
kid regular nursery layout not for
mine thanks all  want now is to be let
alone thats all im going to say go
way and dont bother me

   hal open that door sir

  never a word came back quite unfruit-
fully the captain knocked and argued en-
treated threatened he got no reply

   at last realizing that his grandson occu-
pied the tactical advantage and that he was
only lowering his dignity and making him-
self absurd by such vain efforts the cap-
tain turned and departed his eyes glow-
ered strangely as he made his way down-
stairs into the front hall

  ezra had disappeared but the old doc-
tor was standing in the hallway under the
gleam of a ships lantern that hung there

    captain said he with timid hesitation
as he clutched his supporting cane and
peered through his glasses  captain i
fee that my presence in this house at this
particular time may add to your sense of

embarrassment therefore i think i had
best return to salem this evening if you
will kindly ask ezra to harness up my horse
in case hes able ill be obliged

  ill do nothing of the kind doctor
briggs interrupted stoutly  youre my
friend and my guest and youre not going
to be driven out by any such exhibition of
brutal bad manners as weve had here to-
night i ask you sir to stay

   you really mean that captain you
know i can manage the drive to endicutt
quite well and there of course i can get the
 southbound train

   	youll take no train and no drive to-
night sir the captain tugged excited-
ly at his beard his eyes threw fire i
havent seen you for fifty years sir and you
do no more than lay longside and then
want to hoist canvas again and beat away
xever sir here you stay to-night aboard

if you will cruise with me a week on the
ocean of memories go and leave me now

tain-

   briggs took the doctor by the hand and
looked steadily into his anxious face

    listen said he in a deep quiet tone
 im in trouble doctor deep black bit-
ter trouble you can see that you under-
stand xobody in this world but you can
help me steer a straight course now if

chapter xxiii

slxsirini

the miracle of a new days sunshine-
june sunshine golden over warm
green earth foam-collared shore and
shining sea brought in its train another


ali story wkkkiy

miracle almost as great as that which hail
transformed the somber night to radiant
morning this miracle was the complete
reversal of the situation at snug harbor
and the return of peace and happiness hut
all this cannot be told in two breaths we
must not run too far ahead of where our
story leads us

  so to go on in orderly and decent fash-
ion we must know that ezras carefully ire-
pared supper the subject of such long and
affectionate thought turned out to be a
sad a melancholy failure other it could
not be the somber dejection of the three
old men at table and then the miserable
evening of the captain and the doctor on
the piazza talking of old days with infinite
regret of the present with grief and humilia-
tion of the future with black bodings made
a sorry time of it all

   night brought but little sleep to captain
briggs the doctor worn out by a day of
unaccustomed exertions slept well enough
and ezra quite without nerves seconded
him rut the good fortune of oblivion
was not for the old captain through what
seemed a black eternity he lay in the bunk
in his cabin pondering brooding agoniz
ing listening to the murmurous restlessness
of the sea the slow tolling of hours from
the tall clock in the hallway i he cessation
of the ticking of his chronometer seemed to
leave a strange vacancy in his soul deeply
he mourned it

  after an infinite time half-sleep won
upon him troubled by ugly dreams and
visionings of batu kawan and the sluggish
fever-stricken timbago river the straits
the battle the slave-driving ivory coast
alpheus briggs seemed to behold again the
stifling huts and alleyways of the malay
town the carabaos and chattering gharri-
men the pedlers and whining musicians
the smoky torch-flares and dark slow-mov-
ing river he seemed to smell once more
the odors of spice and curry the smoke of
torches and wood fires the dank and reek-
ing mud of the marshy fever-bitten shore

  nd then the vision changed he was
at sea again he was witnessing the death of
scurlock and the boy the death of the girl
kuala pahang in the blood-tinged shark-
teeming waters came the battle with the

malays in all its horror exaggerated by
the grotesque exaggeration of a dream and
then ihe torments of the hell-ship cargoing
slaves from the ivory coast to cuba the
old captain seemed stifled b the reek anil
welter of that freight he seemed to hear
i heir groans and cries and all at once he
heard again as in a voice from infinite dis-
tances the curse of shiva flung at him by
hengan jouga witch woman of the malay
tribesmen

    i he evil spirit will pursue you even beyond
llu wind even beyond ihe silken sea vishnu
will repay you dead men shall come from their
-raves like wolves lo follow you birds of
ihe ocean foam will poison you iife will become
in you a thins more terrible than the venom of
lhi katclnihon flower ami evil seed will grow
within your hear i

    evil -ecd will urow anil flourish there dtag-
uina you down to death down to the longing for
death anil yet you cannot die and the blind
face in the sky will watch you sahib- watch you
and launh because you cannot die that is ihe
curse of vishnu on your soul

  in the captains dream the groaning and
crying of the wounded and perishing men
aboard the silver fleece men struck down
in the battle of motomolo strait all for the
captains bull-headed clinging to the girl
-eemed to blend with that of the dying
slaves nd gradually all this echoing agony
transmuted itself into a kind of sinister and
terrible mirth a horrifying ghastly laughter
far and strange ceaseless monotonous
maddening

  somewhere in a boundless sky of black
the captain seemed to behold a vast spiral
whirling ever whirling in and in and at
its center vague formless yet filled with
demoniac menace he dimly saw a blind face

  more than a blind face but it had never
had eyes -an eyeless face indeed that still
for all its blindness seemed to be watching
him and as it watched it laughed bloorl-
freezingly

  captain briggs roused to his senses lie
found himself sitting up in bed by the open
window through which drifted the solemn
roar and hissing back-wash of a rising surf
a pallid moon-crescent tangled in spun
gossamer-fabric of drifting cloud cast tenu-
ous fairy shadows across the garden star-
ing the captain rubbed his eyes

i
cursed



   judas priest he muttered  what-
where- ah dreaming eh only dream-
ing thank god for that

  then with a pang of transfixing pain
back to him surged memories of what had
happened last night for a moment he sat
there thinking then he slid out of bed
struck a match and looked at his watch
the hour was just a bit after two

  noiselessly briggs crept from his room
climbed the stairs slipped down the pas-
sageway and came to hals door awake
though the old man now was the menace
of the curse of kuala pahang still weighed
terribly upon him something of the vague
superstitions of the sea superstitions that o
man be he never so materialistic can quite
escape if he follows the great waters long
enough seemed to have infused themselves
into the captains blood shuddering he
remembered the curse that now for many
years had lain forgotten in die dusty
archives of his youth remembered even
more than he had dreamed remembered
another curse laid on him by the ncnck ka-
bayan the witch-woman-that strange yel-
low ghostlike creature which had come
upon him silently over his rum and gam-
bling in the cabin of the hell-ship

    something you love-love more than your own
life-will surely die you will die then but still
you will not die you will pray for death but
death will mock and will not come

  the old captain shivered as he stood be-
fore the door of hals room suppose the
ancient curse really had power what then
suppose it should strike hal and drag him
down-suppose hal should die what
then 

  for a moment he heard nothing within
the room and his old heart nearly stopped
altogether but almost at once he per-
ceived a sound rhythmic gentle-hals
breathing quiet and natural as that of a
child

  oh thank god the captain mur-
mured his heart and soul suddenly expand-
ing with gratitude with blest relief after
fear he remained there a little while
keeping silent vigil at the door of his well-
loved boy the very door that hal so brutal-
ly had locked in his face and refused to

open then quite satisfied that all was
well he retraced his steps got back into

bed	and so presently fell into a very deep
and peaceful slumber

  a knocking at his door awoke him to-
gether with the voice of ezra

   capn briggs sir its six bells o
the mornin watch time to turn out
the captain blinked and rubbed his eyes

   -	come in ezra bade he mustering his
wits  -m  he grunted at sight of ezras
cheek-bone now black-and-blue with an
ugly cut across it  the doctor up yet
 yes sir hes been cruisin out round
the lawn an garden an hour or some such
matter hes a real interestin old saw-
bones aint he but hes too kind o
mournful like about his nerves to set right
on my stomach kind of a pessimist like
only happy when hes miserable -mens

sigh where others would heave a brick

   will you stop your fool talk and get
down to business demanded the captain
with some heat tie sat up in bed and
peered at ezra with disapproval to his
lips he could not bring a direct question
about the boy and ezra sparring for time
was equally unwilling to introduce the sub-
ject fearing lest some word of blame might
be spoken against his idol  tell me some

i got bigger the board got till at last i up
an run away listen to me capn no mat-
ter what kind of arbitration you use dont
never drive that boy out sames i was
drove i know master hals sound an
good at heart but hes had his own head
too long now fer you to try rough tactics

   rough when was  ever rough with
hal

   	mebbe if you had of been a few times
when he was small reasonable rough y
understand- it d of been better but its
too late now fer that hes as full o life an
vigor as the sea lawyer aint let him
keep his sperrit capn let him keep all
canvas aloft but hold a hard helm on him
hold it hard

   the sound of singing somewhere down
across the road toward the shore drew the
old captains attention out the window
striding home from his morning plunge and
wim hal was returning to snug harbor
 coming up with a song from the sea

   the captain got up put on his bathrobe
and girded it about him then went to the
window and sat down there in a chair he
leaned his crossed arms on the sill and
peered out anxiously enough at hal ezra
meanwhile discreetly withdrew

   o sin seemed visible on hal of last
cursed



nights mad rage and warfare sleep and
a clean shave joined to the exhilaration
of battling with the savage surf along the
face of geyser rock had swept away all
traces of his brutality molded into his
wet bathing-suit that revealed every line
of that splendidly virile body he drew near

  all at once he caught sight of captain
briggs leaning from the window he
stopped his song there by the lantern-
flanked gateway and waved a hand of
greeting

   top o the morning to you grand-
father cried he in a strong vibrant tone
that echoed from his high-arched chest with
sonorous power there he stood a living
sculpture of young manhood overflooded
with life strength spirits his body
gleamed with glistening brine his face
lighted by a smile of boyish frankness shone
in the morning sun his thick black hair
that he had impatiently combed straight
back with his fingers dripped sea-water on
his bronzed muscular shoulders thus
there he stood at the gate looking up with
a kind of waiting anxiety at the old cap-
tain in the cabin window

 god what a man the captain
thought  that chest those arms hard
as nails and ridged with sinews hes only
twenty-one or so but hes better than ever
i was at my best

  and once again in spite of all his sor-
row and forebodings he felt his old heart
thrill beat high expand with pride and
hope-hope that through all narrow straits
beyond all towering barriers still reached
out to lay eager hold upon the future and
its dreams

   ill be ready for you in a few minutes
was the prosaic enough remark that came
to utterance from the captains lips  i
want to see you sir before breakfast

  hal grinned boyishly and nodded com-
prehension from the hedge he broke a
little twig and held it up

   heres the switch gramp said he
whimsically  youd better use it now
while ive got bare legs

  the old man had to smile he leaned
a little further from the window and with
eyes of profound affection gazed at hal
sunlight on his head and hals struck out

wonderful contrasts of snow and jet the
luminous celestial glow of a june morning
on the new england coast-a morning su-
preme in warmth and color in the per-
fumes of sea and shore of tree and vine and
flower a morning gemmed with billions of
dewdrops flashing on leaf and lawn a morn-
ing overbrooded by azure deeps of sky un-
clouded-folded the world in beauty

   a sense of completion of fulfilment of the
work of loveliness compassed everything
autumn looks back wistfully regretfully
at all that was winter shivers between
memories and hopes spring hopes indeed
more strongly still-but june fulfils com-
pletes and resting says  behold

   such was that morning and the captain
looking at his boy so deeply loved felt
something of its magic expanding soothing
calming the troubled heart within him on
the lawn of snug haven two or three robins
were busy in the traditional work of proving
how very indiscreet a worm is to be an early
worm another robin teetering high on
the plumy green-feather crest of a shadow-
ing elm was emptying its heart of melody

  for a long minute old man and young
man looked steadily at each other then
hal came along up the white-sanded walk
between the two precisely arranged rows of
polished conch-shells swinging onward
with the ease of perfect and coordinated
strength he passed the flagpole and the
brass cannon and stopped at the old mans
window

   grandfather said he in a low tone
 will you listen to me please

   what have you got to say sir de-
manded briggs and stiffened his resolution
too easily too quickly had it melted as he
had looked at this well-loved grandson in
whom all hopes were centered  well sir
what have you got to say

    listen grandfather answered hal in
a straightforward and very manly way that
harmonized with his clear blue-eyed look
and with the whole air of ingenuous and
boyish contrition that enveloped him he
crossed his bare arms over his powerful
chest looked down a moment at the sand
dug at it a little with a toe and then once
more raised his head  listen please ive
got just one thing to beg of you and that


all story wkkkly

is pleas dont lecture me and dun  in-
harsh i stand here absolutely penitent
grandfather begging to be forgiven ive
already apologized to hr filhiol and i-zra
you know-

   so i understand jmi in briggs still
striving hard to make his voice sound un-
compromising  well

   well grandfather - as for apologizing
to you thats kind of a hard proposition
it isnt that  dont want to hut you know
the relations between us have been so close
that its pretty hard to make up a regular
formal apology you and i arent on a
basis where i really could apologize as i
could to anybody else--or almost anybody
else but i can say this that i certainly
did act the part of a brute and a ruffian
on the sylvia fletcher and  was certainly
a rotter here last night there only one
other thing-

   and what is that sir demanded
hriggs -stifling the impulse he had to
stretch out his hand to hal and bid him
say no more the captain still maintained
his judicial aloofness despite all cravings
of the heart  what is that

   i-you may not believe it gramp but
its true anyhow i really dont remember
hardly anything about what happened
aboard the schooner or here i suppose 
must be one of those fellows that cant stand
even a couple of drinks it all seems vague
and hazy to me now like a kind of night-
mare or something its all indistinct and
shifting as if it werent me at all but
somebody else i feel just as if id been
landing and watching another man do the
things that i really know i myself did do

i tell myself  did them and  know  did
but some way t cant seem to make it conn-
real the real feeling is that somebody else
took my body and used it and made it do
things that i myself didnt want it to do
hut i was powerless to stop it grampy
im telling you this to get out of being
blamed im telling it because its true
true true

  he paused looking at his grandfather
with eyes of intense and tragic seriousness
old hriggs shivered slightly and drew the
bathrobe more tightly round his shoulders

   go on hal said he

    wei grandfather there isnt much
more to say answered the boy  i know
thereii be consequences and im willing to
face them im ready to stand all the gaff
thats coming if youll only let me live this
thing down and make good with you and
come back ill cut out the booze al-
together it was foolish of me to get into
it at all hut you know how it is at college

  yes i can imagine hal

    they all kidded me for not drinking
a little and so well im not trying to lay
the blame on them you understand its
my own fault right enough anyhow im
done youll forget it and forgive it wont
oil grandpa

     will i my bo  the old man answered
in a tremulous voice he blinked to keep
back the tear- thats a question you
dont have to ask you know the answer
already 

   you really mean that gramp ex-
claimed hal with boyish gladness and en-
thusiasm if i face the music whatever
it is and keep away from any encores will	

you let me by this time	g

  the captain could answer only by stretch	a

ing out his hand and gripping hals the
boy took his old wrinkled hand in a grip
heartfelt and powerful thus for a moment	

the two men old and young one on lifes	a

descending -lope the other climbing its	

first heights feit the strong pressure of
palms that cemented contrition and for-
giveness the captain was the first to
speak

   everythings all right now hal said
he so fars im concerned thats the
most important part of it whatevers
wrong oul-ide snug haven can be and
will be made right i know youve had
your lesson boy

    should say  and what a lesson

 dont need a second

   xo no youll remember this one right
enough well now least said soonest
mended it was pretty shoal water there

coast better charted now xot going to

chapter xxiv

darkening shadow-

breakfast served in the sunny
dining-saloon on a regulation ships
table with swivel-chairs screwed to
the floor and with a rack above for tumblers
and plates- made up by its good spirits and
its overflowing happiness for all the grief
and heartache of the night before hal
expansive with the well-being of the reaction
from his swim and glad in the lustration
of his grandfathers forgiveness radiated
life and high spirits the captains fore-
bodings of evil had been put quite away
had vanished in his newly-revivified hopes
dr filhiol became downright cheerful and
so far forgot his nerves as to drink a cup of
weak coffee as for ezra he seemed in his
best form taking his cue from the hoys
holiday attire of flannels that truly made
a civilized apollo of him the old cook
slipped in a variety of sly innuendos

   judgin by them ar white pants master
hal an by that ar necktie an them
shoes said he as hal breakfast done-
lighted his pipe and blew smoke up into
the sunlit air  an also rememberin the
fact that its saturday an no school keepin 

i	callate laura maynards got jest the
same chances of not takin a walk with a
young man this mornin that ruddy here
has got of learnin them heathen chinee
books o vourn well hail that craft an
speak her fair ef ye so desire it says in
the sacred bible to love vr neighbor as
yrself so you got scripture backin fer
laura

   plus the evidence of im own senses
ezra laughed the boy easily  heighol 
he stretched his powerful arms and drew
with satisfaction at his pipe his freshly
shaven well-tanned face with those now
placid blue eves of his and with that thick
grown black hair crowning the well-modeled
head seemedto have no possible relation-
ship with the mask of viciousness of animal

   	a-s

hate and rage that it had been the night
before

  liven the blow that hal had received had
left but little mark on that vigorous healthy
ilesh as he sat there smoking and observ-
ing lra with an amused twinkle in his
look he appeared no other than an ex-
traordinarily well-grown powerfully de-
veloped young man could it be after all
the captain asked his heart could it be
that in this boy this lithe well-groomed
quiet-appearing boy such seed of evil
lurked as had last night burst forth into
that wild exotic jungle of mad passion

  it ail seemed downright impossible the
captain putting aside memories of other
disquieting fits of rage entered a denial

   must have been the rum that did it
he tried to convince himself  works that
way with some people sets them crazy
plumb downright crazy they lose all
anchors canvas -ticks anil everything-go
in the rocks smash when theyve only
shipped a drink or two thats what was
at the bottomof it-rum and therell be
no more rum for hal  ies passed his word
that hes through that means he is
through because whatever else he may or
may not be hes a briggs so then thats
settled

  	heigho exclaimed hal again  now
that youve put me in mind of laura 
think i will take a walk down-street i
might just possibly happen to meet her
im glad you reminded me ezra

   i guess you aint in need o much
remindin master hal replied the old
t ook solemnly  but theres one thing i
oil remind you of an that is to sail a
steady course an not carry too much can-
vas youre too young a capn to be lookirj
for a mate on the sea o life dont give
ihat gal no great encouragement master
hal go slow you cant never tell what a
woman or a jury  do an most women
jump at a chanst quicker n what they do
at a mouse you aint out o college yet
go easy

    for an old bachelor an old pair of
scissors with only one blade you seem to
understand the cut of the feminine gender
pretty well smiled the boy

   understand females replied ezra

drawing out a corn-cob and a pouch of
shag  not me some men think they
do but then some men is dum fools all

i	say is look out fer em then you cant
git far out o the channel theyre danger-
ous women is no charted coast no lights
nothin but love-lights an that most always
turns out to be will-o-the-wisp that piles
ye up on the rocks when a man gits
stuck on a gal seems like hes like a fly
stuck on fly-paper-sure to git his leg
pulled not meanin your case now master
hal but jest as a kind o general proposi-
tion y understand

  hal laughed again got up passed a few
commonplaces with his grandfather and the
doctor and then departed with that kind
of casual celerity which any wise old head
can easily interpret when a girl is near on a
june morning ezra striking into a sea-
ditty with a monotonous chorus of  blow
the man down began gathering up the
breakfast-dishes the captain and his guest
made their way to the quarter-deck-the
piazza you understand-and settled them-
selves in rockers with the airedale close
by

  briggs had hardly more than filled and
lighted his pipe when his attention was
caught by the appearance down the road
of a slow-jogging white-canvas covered
wagon bearing on its side the letters
 r f d

   hello said the captain a shade of
anxiety crossing his face-recurrent anx-
iety for a time dispelled by the good-cheer
of the breakfast table  hello theres del
clark and the mail excuse me doctor
till i see what this day means to bring
forth

  he tried to speak with unconcern but
into his voice crept a foreboding that
matched his look as he strode down the
sanded walk filhiol peered after him and
shook a dubious head

   its a shame a sin and shame the way
hes worried now the doctor murmured
 that boys got the devil in him hell
kill the captain yet a swim a shave and
a suit of white flannels dont change a mans
heart whats bred in the bone whats
bred-

  captain briggs reached the gate of lan-

terns and came to a stand there waiting
for the mail he feared to see his nervous-
ness betrayed itself by the thick cloud of
tobacco-smoke that rose from his lips upon
the morning air leisurely the mail-wagon
drew along zigzagging from side to side of
the street as the postman slid papers and
letters into little metal boxes and hoisted
the red flags always taking good care that
no card escaped him unread

   mornin capn said del clark com-
ing to anchor by the gate  heres your
weather report an heres your  shippin
news an heres a letter from boston
from the college where hal goes to you
dont spose hes in any kind o rookus down
there huh an heres a letter from squire
bean down to the center dont callate
theres any law-doins do you

   what do you mean demanded the
captain trying to keep a brave front
though the heart within him sank like a
dipsy-lead  what could there be

   oh you know bout how hal rim-
racked mclaughlin  heered tell down-
along suthin about his goin to sue fer
swingein damages seems like hal dum
nigh killed the critter no grot put-out
ef he had i vowny but mac hes maddern
snakes in havin-time an-

   who told you demanded the captain
still holding the letters in his hand as if
paralyzed and unable to open either

   oh theyre all talkin an i see mac
myself goin inta the squires house on a
crutch an with one arm in a sling early
this mornin this here letter must of been
wrote right away after that the ink aint
hardly dry onto it yit course i hope it
aint nuthin asseverated del with that
veiled malice which the best of us inevitably
feel in any neighbors distress  but looks
to me like tis well-

  he eyed the captain expectantly hoping
the old man might open the letter and con-
fide its contents or at least by some in-
voluntary exclamation betray the news
which del could bear like the fiery cross
of the scotch highlands to all and sundry
over the whole countryside but no the
captain merely nodded thrust the letters
into the capacious breast-pocket of his
square-rigged brass-trimmed coat of blue
i

cursed



and with a non-committal  thank you
del turned and made his way back up
she walk to the piazza

  his shoulders drooped not neither did
his step betray any faltering any weakness
to the peering eyes of the r l d man
self-appointed publieitv-agent for that
whole stretch of coast xot in presence of
del clark would captain briggs betray
emotion whereat the disgruntled postman
muttered something surly clucked to his
horse and in profound disappointment
pursued his business the leisurely distribu-
tion and collection of incle sams mail and
everybodys private affairs

   t he same robin or perhaps after all it
was a different one was singing in the elm
as alpheus briggs returned to the house
down the shaded street every leaf of which
was jeweled with sun-flashing dew every
grass-plot strewn with the living moving
gold of sunlight through wind-stirred foli-
age the musical metallic rhythm of the
anvil was breaking through the contrabass
of the vexed surf but now this melody
fell on deaf ears for captain briggs
heavily he came up the steps and with an
air of weariness sank down in the big
rocker something bothered him sadly
he shook his head

    its come im afraid said he dejected-
ly  its come after all  was hoping it
wouldnt hoping mclaughlin would let
it go just as a fight that finished where it
began but that was hoping too much
hes no man to swallow a beating xo
bully is either hes got to lick or he wont
attempt to play see here now will
you

  the captain pulled out his letter from
squire bean and extended it to filhiol
the doctor read the return-card printed in
the corner of the envelope

   local attorney asked he with a look
of anxiety

   and only one answered the captain
 this letter means only one thing ba-
rometers falling again well have to take
in more canvas sir

  he tore the envelope clumsily enough
for his fingers were not only thick and old
but now were trembling a little the letter
when spread out revealed a crabbed hand-

  writing which the captains anxious eyes
deciphered thus

kndicuu massachusetts

  icjh sir captain fergus mclaughlin of the
sylvia fletcher ha- placed in my hands for set-
tlement the matter of the assault and halterv
committed upon him to  degree almost amount-
ing to manslaughter in your grandson hal
briggs captain mclaughlin is in bad shape
under a doctors care is minus a front tooth has
his right arm broke and cannot walk without a
rruu- you are legally liable for these injuries
and would be immediately summoned into court
except capt mclaughlin has regard for your
age and position in the community there is
however no doubt legal damages coming to the
capt ii you call we can discuss ami of same
otherwise let the law lake its course

resily

lis-candidate for judge of dist
ourt

  p s-it is dr stevens who is allending the
capt and he will corroborate my statements as
to the injuries done and et cetera if you wish to
see him before visiting mv office

  this letter tor all its absurdities of
style produced no smile on the lips of cap-
tain briggs instead his boding dejection
deepened as he reread it carefully then
tugging at his beard passed the letter over
to dr filhiol

   its all as i was afraid ii would be you
see said the captain  mclaughlins
not going to take the medicine hes really
been earning for long years of huckoing
the poor devils that have signed articles
with him xto doctor first time he meets
a man one that can stand up to him and
pay him back with interest he steers a
course for the law thats your bully and
your coward at heart for you thank
god for all my doings  never fought my
fights before a judge or jury it was the
best man win fist to fist or knife to knife
if it came to that but the law sir
never 

   well that doesnt matter now said
filhiol squinting at the letter  im
afraid youre in for whacking damages
captain

   dont think so really do you

it looks that way to me hals lucky


all-story weekly

as you know yourself that he wasnt a
signed-on member of the crew thered
have been mutiny for you to get him out of
and iron bars lucky again he didnt hit
just a trifle harder or in some other and
more vita spot if he had it might easily
have been murder and in this state they
send men to the chair for that yes cap-
tain youre lucky its turned out no worse

if you have only a hundred or two dollars
to pay for doctors bills and damages
youll be coming out of it most fortu-
nately

 a hundred or two dollars ejaculated
the captain judas priest you dont
think therell be any such bill as that for
repairs and demurrage on mclaughlins
hulk do you

  think that would be a very moderate
sum in view of the damage inflicted by
your grandsons fists answered filhiol

 however thats something we can hardly
speculate on now all i can say now is
this that im willing to stand back of you
captain all the way ill go into court and
examine mclaughlin myself as an expert
witness its more than possible mclaugh-
lin and squire bean here are exaggerating
matters to shake you down so far as that
goes they cant succeed because as i
say-

youll stand back of me doctor ex-
claimed the captain his face lighting up

 youll gb into court and steer me
straight

to be continued next week dont forget this magazine is issued weekly and
that you will get the continuation of this story without waiting a month

    by ail means sir

   briggs nearly crushed the doctors feeble
 hand with the all-too-powcrfu grip he gave
 it

    well and manly spoken sir said he

   its like you doctor in the old days
 you were that way you havent changed
 well all i can do is to thank you and
 accept your offer that puts a better slant
 to our sails right away i feel now that i
 may get through this storm without jettison-
 ing any more dollars than  really have to
 good sir-very very good

   his expression was quite different as he
 tort- open the other letter the letter from
 the college whence hal had just come
 perhaps after all this was only some
 routine communication but as he read
 the neat typewritten lines a look of -in-
 credulity astonishment bewildered lack of
 comprehension developed and this in turn
 gave way to a most pitiful dismay and
 grief

   the captains hands were shaking now
 so that he could hardly hold the letter his
 face had gone quite bloodless all the voice
 he could muster was a kind of whispering
 gasp dry-throated hoarse as he stretched
 out the sheet of paper to the wondering
 filhiol

    read-read that doctor the curse
 -the curse its falling on me surely
 falling on me now

it was the talk all along hear creek how
the out-of-season electric storm that
burned houses killed a horse and felled
the best timber left there an unparalleled
siege of scarlet fever the storm might
have brought about the scourge queer
things happen at any rate after it was
over fever lay red and torturing upon the
small population of the cotton-belt

  van camps son husky as a pirate
cheered by catnip tea and his grandmothers
stories of wild dogs and headless horses
pulled through magnificently but emmett
aylers little daughter just beginning to
walk and talk was not quite the same
afterward

  it takes a mother to meet trouble more
than half-way iiz ayler she that had
been liz elly-ran over to tell roxey van
camp about it xot that liz loved roxey
there was a time when emmett left liz-
making her wedding clothes- and went to
worship a girl with slim throat and wind-
meshed hair

  in the stillness of the night with her
husband breathing heavily beside her she
told herself relentlessly that in spite of
some things roxey malone was between
them-ghost of the unattainable it was
the primitive mother in liz together with a
wholesome appreciation of roxeys good
sense and generosity that winged her feet
down the orchard slope across a green
splash of alfalfa up through the plum-grove
to the bungalow on the hillside

 want you to come home with me liz

panted standing white-faced in the door-
way of the van camp living-room she
said this to the young mistress signifi-
cantly she turned her black eyes on mrs
malone busy with her embroidery caught
in one glance the handsome youngster build-
ing a castle of blocks on the hearth and the
blue and white uniformed mulatto maid
making lettuce salad at the sideboard

   alone liz added tensely

  roxey jumped up from the piano she
was startled frightened as she ran after
liz between dipping boughs and through
knee-high clover it was her belief that little
ilepsibah-the ayler baby was named for
emmetts mother-was in a fit but there
were no signs of trouble about the big
pointed house on the hill

   sit down liz invited and roxey sank
breathless into the leather chair pointed out
 ill get you some cold water liz added
she hurried out and there was heard the
creak of the windmill

  it was a gloomy place where van camps
young wife was left to wait and wonder a
carpet of unclipped brussels matched for
heaviness the greenish paper on the walls
and the windovv-shades the furniture was
of mahogany haircloth and leather aylers
a score of them long thin and ashy of
feature scowled down from their frames
with a sort of unreasonable pride roxey
shuddered she thought of the new house
fronting the white meridian road and
wondered how liz could wait to move into
it

 


all-story weekly

   the babys crib-one joyous lone in the
big living-room swayed by the north win-
dow and through airy canopy of gauze
little hepsibah could be seen gracefully
relaxed in sleep roxey had turned to this
pleasing picture when liz came in

    it is about her she nodded toward
the child pouring some water from a
sparkling pitcher into a sparkling glass she
waited for roxey to drink before selling
the tray on the reading-table her dark
face was tragedy itself as she stood silently
looking down al the baby finally she
crossed the room to a small compartment
on the right and signaled the other to follow
her roxey remembered the nook as the
bedroom where emmett had lain after he
had all but died to save her son now it
showed itself to be a childs nursery a
rose-sprigged carpet was on the iloor
shelves cabinets and hangers were heaped
and loaded with costly things-offerings
mrs van camp found from the avlers

   liz touched a tiny coat of turquoise
velvet lined with scented satin and trimmed
with swansdown  from grandfather ay-
ler she murmured turning she lifted
an ivory elephant from a mantel- aunt
sarah gave this her foot had touched a
huge doll with real hair and she called
roxeys attention to it  grandmother
ayler brought that and the whole row sit-
ting against the wall she says she never
had a doll and hepsibah shall be rich with
them

   for some time liz held her company
thus she showed necklaces rings satin
shoes and lace hoods manicure and dressing
sets silk pillows wonderful little quilts and
socks of cobweb fler expression was re-
strained until she came to an  a-b-c book 
of linen much crumpled and tattered with
baby clutchings and chewings then she
sobbed she took the book with her as
they left the room and while they sat facing
each other she caressed it on her knee with
soft strokes of her long firm fingers

    theyve never had any use for -me-
emmetts people she said bluntly  of
course ive held up but its been in my
heart all the time eating there like a cancer
emmett-weve been closer since he was
cut to pieces in that pit back of your gin

and i gave the blood out of my arm to save
him-stili  know that he knows im an
elly

  liz opened the soiled linen-book closed
it anti the vivid lines of her face trembled

	i sis people didnt intend lo have anything
to do with me but after they came back
from tennessee and saw hepsibah it was
different they worship the baby any-
thin with the blood of ayler ive found is
-crcnt

      hey ye no business to make you feel
that way roxey cried indignantly if
theyre as narrow as that i wouldnt care
hut the baby-is something wrong with
her

   i want you to see for yourself ive
been trying to fill the time till she wakes up
id rather not disturb her you dont mind

waiiing

   no said roxey

  a silence fell finally there was a sigh
from the crib a funny little gurgle and flop
hepsibah came up feet first righted herself
and called to her mother

   mu-uh

   yes darling mrs ayler answered
sweetly then she did something incom-
prehensible to roxey she leaned and
shoved a chair between herself and the
crib - come she prompted softly  right
here honey

  hepsibah put aside the netting reaching
one white-moccasined foot over the edge of
the low crib she feit for the floor and
found it carefully she planted the other
foot firmly and balanced herself like a
flower in the wind cocking her dusk little
curls sidewise she questioned quaintly

- mu-uh

  	here i am liz spoke from behind the
chair

  with wabbly wide-apart steps the baby
advanced stopped and again made the
adorable sidewise little dip of her head

  -	mu-uh

    here right here

  whitely roxey watched the child take a
fresh start and stagger into the chair she
saw hepsibah pat the chair feel her way
around it and finally come to anchor in
triumph at her mothers knee she stared
at the mother and child then away
daughter of ayler



   blind  breathed liz

  roxey could only nod when she heard
the expression

   emmett doesnt suspect i wasnt sure
of it myself until just as  went after you
you know she hasnt really walked before
and there was no way to tell what  want
is to take her away to a hospital and see
what can be done roxey van camp it is
you  am asking for help i want two
hundred dollars i dont know when it will
he paid i dont want emmett and his
people to know i dont want any one but
you to know maybe she can be cured
if not- tiz paused and did not say what
she had in mind

  roxey van camp had known trouble
danger starvation her beloved mother had
been blind even as liz uttered the request
her mind was made up   am glad you
asked me she said simply

    yes - youre that kind she lowered
her voice theres emmett it must be
dinner-time

  ayler wasnt really embarrassed before
roxey but it always seemed that he was
liz spared any awkwardness as he came
into the room  take the baby emmett
she said  and let me get mrs van camp
a cup of yeast foam

  roxey knew that liz hail spent lour
years digging her way out of the elly
dialect but it was the native wit of her that
counted in an emergency with the pungent
foam dipping from the white jar in the
cupboard she turned at the door for a nod
of understanding liz whose face showed
blanched above the snowy flare of her
collar was practically refitting the cover
on the yeast crock beyond her stood
emmett his little daughter pressed lightly
in his arms there spoke the elly courage
and the ayler pride

  mrs van camp took the downward path
briskly the sun picked gold from the
floating meshes of her light-brown hair her
little strapped sandals shone she still wore
the girlish  middy  that john called a
 jumper love contentment and rosie
sunpies cooking had rounded her beauti-
fully she looked exactly like the sort of
young person who could draw on the family
bank for two hundred dollars and no ques-

tions would be asked concerning its dispo-
sition briefly that is what happened

    liz had cherry pie fried chicken pine-
 apple salad new potatoes and little beet-
 greens the day before she told her husband
 he was going to the city for a month-
 maybe more emmett was down to his
 third cup of coffee and his second helping of
 pie it was the ayler of it that he didnt
 act surprised

     whats that for he asked quietly
 after the silence had become oppressive

     need a change and so does hepsibah
 liz said

     yuh going tuh take hepsy

    why of course silly liz laughed

    emmett finished his pie and his coffee

  guess youre joking liz

    liz gave the baby a spoonful of bread
 and milk then wiped the little bib with a
 napkin  do  joke emmett she finally
 rebuked him

    i he ayler spoke out  i dont want you
 should go

    	 must

   	why must yuh whats the matter
 here all of a sudden  take hepsy tuh
 the city and she git sick city water haint
 lot for a baby

     ill boil every bit of it emmett and-use
 lime-water besides

    ayler set down his cup me had lost his
 dash of color  mebbe i could go along
 he suggested yielding somewhat

   the house emmett- you agreed to
 shingle it yourself more than that you
 contracted didnt you

    yler had forgotten the new house  yes
 that settles it he told her triumphantly

 youll have to cook for me man shin-
 gling all day in the boiling sun hes got
 tuh eat

    	your mother will see to that she is
 coming lo-morrow with a girl to help her
 the work wont be anything-shell have

    	dont make any difference liz you

    youd look well in the city alone


all-story weekly

  ive got people there-the morgans
 i haint going tuh have my wife living
off the morgans

   i have some money of my own emmett
-enough

   yuhre going-whin  tell vuh not to
   yes

  ayler got up with such violence that the
table rocked  yuh cant go he shouted
 yuh hear me

   so do the neighbors the girls hot
temper arose  do be still emmett-you
frighten hepsy

  the baby leaned in her high-chair her
dark curls tilted backward and sidewise
liz knew that the wonderful purple pools
that were-her eyes strained between their
dusk fringes upon herself and emmett-
strained and could see nothing the tiny
pucker on the rosebud mouth stiffened the
mothers courage she stood up and faced
her husband her eyes leveled upon his

   did i ever tell you you couldnt do
anything she said reasonably

  then emmett reverted to type he
leaned as if to strike her he clutched her
arm  no-but i tell you he snarled
 that you cant take hepsy tuh the city
that settles it

  liz shrugged away  you cant keep
me from it she told him coolly  if id
suspicioned youd act this way emmett i
wouldnt have mentioned the matter

   and sneak off without letting me
know

   not sneak-just go

  the man dropped his hands in a way he
had  all right go see if i care but
dont come back you hear

   emmett

    i mean it

   ayler started around the table toward the
baby he wanted to kiss the piteous look
from her little face to feel her mite of a
nose in his neck her hands in his hair liz
looked at him questioningly he kissed
hepsibah once and turned to the door

   thats all he stated insultingly i
haint coming back till yore gone

   liz conquered her desire to say something
terrible she ran and clung to her husband
 youll be sorry emmett she sobbed
youll be sorry

  brutally he broke from her  jest sorry
i tied to an elly he sneered and was
gone

  liz watched her husbands furious stride
down the slope  next week theyll all be
here she mused bitterly  and how they
will hate me

  fortune favors the brave mrs ayler
was ready and gone within an hour after
the clash she caught a ride with a strange
family motoring along the section line a
sanitorium is a safe place for hiding taken
to the very door of the institution liz and
little hepsibah entered swiftly and were
blotted from the annals of bear creek

  behind them the house of ayler arose
with clenched list-and cursed



  emmktt aylur had been wrapped
around by the warm presence of his wife
he had been worshiped obeyed slaved for
deferred to he was even above the baby
she had borne in her affections to find
that she had any thought apart from him-
self a will of her own-he suspected evilly
a secret of her own was cruel as death

  there is no limit to the crazy things a
man of aylers type will do emmetts first
act after he had searched through the
empty spaces of the gloomy house on the
hill was to lift the cut-glass berry-dish that
had been a wedding present from the ellys
and dash it to the floor standing amid the
fragments of diamond-bright glass he shook
his fist

  curse her curse her he breathed
venomously  may god damn her and the
devil get her

  ayier shingled his house according to
contract but he did not eat a bite for three
windy blistering dust-ridden days he
wanted liz-was lost and beside himself
without her but he would not admit it
even in his inmost heart it was the baby
he hungered for his little daughter whose
presence he craved when it came out that
liz was away with a sort of selfish pride
he stated that she had taken the baby to
see lncle hi over in  tinnessee

mother ayler reproved him for the lie
daughter

of ayler



mother ayler dyed her hair and dipped
snuff but she used ilat silence instead of
words to deny it  tell the truth and
shame the devil she advised her son
 shes run off and thats all they be to it
it  have to come out some time xother
thing i want yuh tuh go tuh town and git
that young one -me and grampawll go
crazy ef yuh dont dont fool around-
take her-jest take her wont no jedge in
oklahoma give an elly nuthin

    grampaw  found immense comfort in
berating the ellys  them ellys he
rasped slamming down the trunk-lid on
toy-piano doll-house teddy-bears music-
box and a dozen and one other extrava-
gances they had brought little hepsibah
 them ellys is crooked as a dawgs hind
leg grampaw had a way of emphasizing
remarks by a twitch of his big-jointed right
thumb

    them ellys he twitched  is a low-
down ornery thievin murderin bootlaig-
in cussin outfit theyd better not tangle
up with me not ary one of em 

  emmett did not mention the number of
trips he had already made to the city he
had nut gone after liz-nothing like that
since she had lied about going to the mor-
gans it didnt matter where she was he
had told her not to come back to bear
creek and he meant it as for hepsibah
-maybe he could  jest take her and then
again maybe he couldnt as days crawled
by he remembered more and more the fight-
ing look in his wifes big black eyes there
was something strange about it strange and
baffling

   one month completed itself and lapped
over into the next one emmett went to
town grampaw went to town sometimes
after a family powwow grammaw uncle
hi from tinnessee aunt sarah from kan-
sas-and all the aunts cousin esmeralda
from colorado and all the cousins went to
whatever place it was decided upon might
have swallowed up little hepsibah it took
money all this prancing about but there
was no lack of money among the aylers
the upshot of it was-they didnt find the
baby and they couldnt find her

   then two months after her disappear-
ance the unexpected happened-little hep-

sibah came back to the big house on the
hill through heavy wind and rain a
touring-car ungainly with chains and mud
labored up the slope the family-a repre-
sentation of them - were seated in the
gloomy living-room themselves gloomy be-
yond words there might have been a ram
on the north door emmett wasnt sure a
lash of spray struck him in the face as he
opened the door and below him on the
step a strange woman clumsy in motor
things stood holding the child in her arms

  after ayler had shut the door on the
woman and the storm he stood stupidly
staring grammaw and grampaw were re-
moving hepsibahs swathings - he could
hear their rapid and senseless chatter so
liz had sent the baby liz wasnt coming
back well-he had told her not to come
he didnt want her back suddenly he
listened

   i cant git her sleeve off cause she
wont turn it loose his mother was saying
 its a letter here emmett see if shell
let you have it

  ayler leaned and looked into the bewil-
dered little face  give daddy the letter
he said gently and hepsibah yielded it up
the thick sheet cracklcd as he drew it from
the long envelope while his father and
mother sniffed audibly he studied the un-
meaning document at last his thick skull
comprehended-this was a health certificate
and belonged to the baby

  it was very plain after the first hepsibah
had been blind from scarlet fever she had
gone through a delicate operation and come
out with good eyes that was why she had
been slow about giving up the letter-she
was not sure who was who pinned to the
sheet was a narrow strip inscribed in his
wifes bold hand

  pay to the order of roxey van camp-two
hundred dollars

   what d she write asked mother
ayler when her curiosity had gotten the
better of her

    yes what d the huzzy have to say for
herself sneered the old man

  ayler did not answer he unpinned the
slip and stepping to the table set his name
to the check leaving the certificate lying

there he went into the bedroom and got
the revolver he kept loaded for marauding
rats then fumbling his hat from its nail
he walked through the dining-room out into
the rain-sodden path

  love is a law to itself- without reason
and without recompense if liz ayler could
have been certain of her husbands undi-
vided affection she would have been in
heaven that was the way liz loved to
stand well with his people was half the
battle in a way motherhood had bound
her to them-she had given the family of
ayler a healthy winsome child to perpetu-
ate the name that was as they understood
it a blind ayler-that would be different
it would be  jest like an elly to have a
blind one the fever that could have
nothing to do with it

  further the family were dead set against
hospitals they looked upon an  opera-
tion  with the horror of the ignorant liz
fought for her own the best she knew
when she took her little daughter and bor-
rowed money to go the lone trail ll ii all
proved a failure she meant to hide herself
and the baby from the reproach of the
aylers if a success-she would come home
in triumph that was as she had planned
it before emmett turned absolute cur and
insulted her

  still liz had not let her baby return
uncomforted it had been the chauffeurs
wife who handed little hepsibah in to the
aylers but liz herself held the precious
burden to her own warm breast every jolt
of the stormy way when at her bidding
the car stopped just beyond sight of the
house the important document had been
placed in the childs hand

   live this to daddy liz had said kiss-
ing the tiny lingers that clutched what was
intrusted to them  he sure-no one must
have it but daddy

daddy repeated hepsibah sweetly

   and be good dont cry-if you ran
help it

 not cry promised hepsibah bravely

    kiss mother they kissed

twenty minutes later liz knocked at the

van camp door l he fragrant breath of a
green-wood tire received her as she stepped
in and confronted the young mistress

   hepsibah can see she announced
briefly   have sent her up there to them
i am not going maybe you want to know
why

  roxe looked at the dripping figure
white-faced and unspeakably tragic  i
dont she answered firmly  at least not
now let me help you to a chair oh you
poor girl

   ill lie down in a minute liz said
hoarsely  i dont know what it is to sleep
about the money its gone every cent i
sent a check for emmett to sign  think
hell do it any way youll be paid

  liz took her eyes from roxeys and for
t moment gathered comfort from the rest
of the family one by one  i want to hide
here a few days  havent eaten much
lately and im weak i dont want any one
to know where  am

  roxev slipped an arm around the fugi-
tives wet shoulders  lean on me she
said

  in a bedroom beside the fireplace she
striped off her guests loo thin jacket and
her soaked shoes as she stooped over the
exhausted woman vler was heard to enter
the living-room dont let him suspect-
whispered liz cio she pushed roxey
from her dont let him know she re-
peated almost savagely

  van camp had opened to ayler he had
set him a chair too but ayler preferred to
stand he was gray ayler-gray like
ashes and water dripped upon the floor
from the hai that hung in his hand

   i guess you know why im here he
spoke to roxey as she came into the room

  its about the money liz borrowed of
you 

  roxey took the check he extended to
her  thank you emmett she said

   what else i got to sav he went on
 is as much for one as another it looks
queer butting into a mans house on a day
like this but  had tuh i got to say in
front of some one that may sometime see
liz what i think of myself im a hound-
worse im a murderer ive killed the liking
liz had fer me
daughter of ayler



   freeing his mind thus far emmett looked
about him he saw mrs malone swaying
gently in her sewing-chair he saw the boy
the boy who tried not to hale ayler stood
quite closc looking up and trying not to
scowl ayler looked longest at van camp

  moistening dry lips he took up the
thread of self-accusation   guess a man
thats got a streak of yellow is never shet
of it unless the lord almighty bleaches him
im yellow-you know that even animals
understand and hate me even your boy
secs through me liz was the only one-
ayler paused swallowing hard the
hand that held the hat al his side gripped
hard  us aylers has always set ourselves
up as better then the elly he resumed
with an effort  we never let liz fergit
that fer a minute thats the big-headed-
ness of us old man elly did kill a man in
a fair hand to hand squabble but i-i
caught a sheep-dawg in a wolf-trap and
beat it to death with a club elly has
bootlaiged whisky and us aylers has guz-
zled it on the sly he cusses and we break
dishes we haint got no more learning
then a mule and dont want none two of
the elly boys is over tuh the university
emmett stopped it was hard to speak
out what must be said  whin liz got that
money of you he turned to roxey and
went away the yellow devil in me struck
her it said  if you go dont ever come
back

   well-he lifted his hands and dropped
them palm out- she haint come back
she sent the baby and she-stayed i
dont blame her theys nuthing to come
back to mebbe if she could a changed
all my blood tuh hers that time things d
been different anyways i haint going back
on the hill if she cant have little hepsi-
bah i wont either ive said some things
-not half  could its mighty good of yuh
tuh listen now im going

   no use to rush off in the rain van
camp said  stav and have supper with
us

  ayler opened the door  no use he
muttered  things is as they be

   stepping out he slammed the door after
him by the porch a sudden scream of
wind snatched off the frost-bitten cotton-

wood leaves and sent them in a yellow
streamer in the desperate mans wake as if
the stain in his sou pursued him

   the boy whom his father called  swash-
buckler ran to the window and looked
alter the fleeing figure  hes going like
the very devil the swashbuckler cried
choosing his phrase with relish  and he
hasnt any more hat on than a rabbit 

    son cried roxey

  beside the fireplace the bedroom door
opened liz had dragged on her shoes and
partly buttoned them but her hat and
jacket were forgotton within the loosened
bands of her midnight hair a glorious color
flamed she crossed the room erectly at
ihe door she swung about and faced roxey

    oh cried liz lifting her palm to her
blazing eyes  isnt a woman a fool

v

  ayler left the plum-grove to westward
and plunged down the lane toward the open
road at flat rock he paused looking
dazedly at the wall of gray wind-driven
ram he had taken the gun from his
pocket holding it in clutching fingers his
arms folded he believed liz was lost to
him and he meant to take the cowards way
out of his bereavement

  his wife was close upon him before he
suspected her presence emmett she
said quietly

   ayler wheeled and stared he slipped the
weapon out of her sight still staring
dazedly he did not wonder how she came
to be there bareheaded thin sleeves cling-
ing to her beautiful arms-only if she were
there at all

   liz he muttered iiz liz is it
you

    of course it is wake up boy-its all
right  heard you-back there

   ayler took her in his arms fearfully at
first then straining her to him for the
lirst time he bruised her with a kiss

   liz he sobbed hoarsely  i haint
fitten-fer you

  the cottonwood leaves came to prison
under the shelving edge of flat rock but
on the orchard slope the two whom tragedy
had made one climbed swiftly-together

the strassblro goose- concluded

dr sleex watched toms enormous
repast with obvious satisfaction
and when it was done he produced
a deadly looking little silver-and-steel in-
strument from his case and bade tom roll
up his sleeve

 whats the matter tom asked he
was too full of good victuals to be over-
energetic

 blood test the doctor explained

  roll up your sleeve

 vince passed a box of cigars and tom
 took one and lighted it and grinned amia-
 bly at the doctor  you know doc he
 said  you please me theres a pertinacity
 about you

  exactly lr sleen agreed   am
 llattered just for that young man i will
 leave you as many of your organs as we
 can possibly manage to get along without

 dont mention it tom urged

  and now-your sleeve-

 tom rose lazily stripped off his coat
 loosed his cuff and turned it back he
 held out his arm for the doctors inspection
 dr sleen eyed it admiringly

 wry fine development young man

tom nodded  this course of treat-
ment youve given me- 

 the doctor waved his hand   cant
 claim all the credit

he jabbed toms arm with a needle

ouch tom ejaculated the doctor
soothed him  there there its all over
now and he squeezed a red drop from
the puncture and deftly sucked up this red
drop with a liny syringe tom eyed this
instrument  thats a neat contrivance
 yes isnt it the surgeon assented
 my own invention more satisfactory i
think than a smear on a slide he was
packing the syringe carefully in his case
and when this was done he turned to the
watchful vince

    expect you to see to it that this young
man eats what is set before him hereafter
he directed

   yes sir said vince

   dont leave him

   i shall be watchful sir

  the doctor bowed to tom turned to the
door and departed and when the door
was closed behind him vince gave tom a
long and baleful stare tom lounging in
a deep chair grinned up at him

   well vince he asked

   youre a troublemaker sir

  	im in trouble myself vince you
ought to be willing to share it

  vince shook his head  im a trouble-
maker myself sir when im crossed he
warned  sometimes my harsh nature
overcomes my tender heart sir

  tom shook his head sorrowfully  tha
will never do vince let me read you a
bit of my poetry it will soothe you

    i fear not sir

this story began in the all-story weekly lor jinuary 
after his own heart



   let me try it anyway

   ive stood a great deal in silence -r-

   silence vince

   comparative silence sir hue i   ui
not stand that  could iii c- r 
for the consequences if yu    utter
those jingles of yours ir

  tom sighed  im afraid you iv stifling
your l-etter nature vince

   im afraid you are sir

  well-we wont quarrel over a r -
noun

  they did not after a thru- vince an-
nounced that the hour hail conn- for -he
afternoon stroll and they wen out to-
gether into the gardens archibald a- ever
two paces to the rear

  and as always on these txcur-ion- tom
kept a vigilant outlook for any word r  un
from sally any trace of her continued
presence in the house he even ventured
to ask vince whether she had been removed
from the island but vince saii firmly

   i can say nothing about ti  matter
sir

  tom could not shake hi reouti-n but
a moment later he found the answer to his
own inquiry

  it had rained the night before a rigor-
ous downpour that beat the sand and soft
earth smooth and clean as a fresh sheet of
paper at a point where their path crossed
another tom discovered in the gravel here
and there a series of depressions some-
thing leaped within him at the sight he
dropped a match and stooped ostentatious-
ly to pick it up

  thus stooping he was able to examine
the depressions more closely and he saw
that they were the marks of two pairs of
feet feet that had passed that -vay since
the rain they were the mark- of the feet
of a man and a woman they were beyond
a doubt the footprints of sally and of
some guard who had accompanied her on
such a stroll as that which he himself was
taking

  she was then still here tom picked
up the match and passed on without con-
fiding to vince his discovery and he began
to consider ways and means by which he
might take advantage of the good luck
which had revealed sallys presence

  she had passed this way once she would
come this way again if he had a note he
might drop it where she would discover it
but what could he say she did not know
the nature of the peril which threatened
him i ml it would do no good for her to
know it would only add to her distress
he cudgeled his brain found no wheat
among the chaff there but at least he
could drop some one of his belongings
something that would tell her he was still
near her

  on the way back lo the house he dropped
his pocket-knife his initials were engraved
on it it fell softly in the grass beside the
path

  goliath touched his shoulder presented
the knife  you drop this ya-as he told
tom and tom was constrained to accept
the restitution and pass on-baffled

  but it was something to know the girl
was near

  he turned his thoughts to a reconsidera-
tion of the possibility of delaying the op-
eration starvation had failed him there
was no chance of trying that again he
might overeat and get indigestion but his
digestion was-he groaned at the recollec-
tion-cast-iron besides indigestion would
hardly save him it was his heart not his
stomach that dr sleen was after

  his heart he wondered what he could
do to hi heart lie would have been will-
ing to acquire any cardiac disorder if by so
doing he might avert the thing that was
coming he considered remembered hav-
ing heard somewhere that alcohol was bad
for the heart

   	vince  he called  i feel like a drink
of whisky

  vince was busy with the gate-legged
table it was the dinner-hour  do you
sir he inquired

   yes serve me a couple of highballs
before dinner and some-oh no thats not
right i want cocktails first and highballs
during dinner see to it vince

  vince shook his head apologetically
 mv orders are-no strong drink sir
very bad for the heart now-a little
wine perhaps

  tom persisted  oh come vince this
business is getting on my nerves im all


all-story weekly

strung up i need letting clown a good
old bat- 

   very sorry sir

    go ahead thats a good fellow you
must know how i feel vince didnt you
ever crave a good shot of
im a teetotaler sir

   iom threw up his hands  i surren-
der and he groaned inwardly his alco-
holic hope was gone xicotin there
was a chance he took it that evening
after dinner he smoked two cigars two
cigarettes told vince to bring more cigars

  and once more vince blocked him
 you have reached your daily limit sir

   my limit i never heard of that
before

   i never mentioned it sir because here
was no need you have never approached
it but you have smoked an unusual
amount to-day

   tom glared at him  you mean to say
im not allowed to smoke all i want in
why they let even a condemned man do
that

   vince shuddered  dont speak of such
things sir i should suppose you had more
delicacy- when that fate hangs over me 

    i beg your pardon vince i forgot
rut its true just the same

    so i believe sir hut-they have no
further use for a condemned mans- er
vitals sir

    and they have for mine and think
smoking will make them a trifle shop-
worn

    exactly sir

   tom felt cold he could not sit still
he stood up paced across the room back
again  by glory vince that doctor is a
cold-blooded specimen

    a doctor needs to be sir vince
too arose  hut i must not allow you to
excite yourself sir you had best go to
bed sir

  tom threw up his hands oh all
right

   when vince with a tenderness almost
maternal had tucked him in for the night
and left him tom tossed back and forth
thinking desperately heart disease heart
disease he had to have it had to have it
quick hut the thing was- how

  tobacco heart barred drunkards
heart beyond his reach what other
kinds of bad hearts were there

   lie sat up in bed with the idea athletic
heart lie had heard of that athletes
got it he was an athlete he ought to
have it but dr sleen had told him his
heart was all right xevertheless athletes
nut athletic hearts how overexertion
iom jumped out of bed and set his teeth
by glory if that was all

  he began to overexert himself it was
no easy task for tom was a husky citizen
he started with callisthenics going through
the familiar exercises at top speed over
and over till he was panting and gasping
and dripping at every pore he stood erect
and bent to touch the floor fifty limes he
stood erect and squatted down and leaped
up again a hundred times he did the
shnulder-roll he dropped on his face and
did chest and back exercises till he could
do no more he turned on his back and
did the seesaw feet up then head up until
lie was dizzy he jumped up and turned
hand-springs till his head was loose on his
shoulders-
when lie had exhausted his repertoire
he started all over again at the beginning
and when he could continue the strenuous
pace no longer he strode back and forth
across the room at top speed

   once he felt his pulse it was madden-
ingly calm he plunged into his over-
exertions with fresh vigor

   he took a chair and used it as a dumb-
bell he took two chairs and brandished
them simultaneously he tackled the bed
and lifted and lowered the foot of the heavy
piece until his back ached he tried to lift
the desk on his back at last succeeded and
marched with it up and down the room
like a baggageman with a trunk until it hit
the chandelier and fell to the floor jerking
him over and on top of it

   hitherto he had managed to keep quiet
but the fall of the desk alarmed the house
and in an instant vince came in the door
and snapped on the light and stared at
tom

   why sir he demanded what are
you doing

   eh whas that tom mumbled he
after his own heart



rubbed his eyes peered at the valet  oh
oh oh sat you vince

   why yes of course sir what is it
sir

  tom grinned foolishly  oh-guess 
had a nightmare vince thought i had
doc sleen

   get back to bed sir vince urged and
he took tom by the elbow  youre hot
sir why youre dripping youil get
pneumonia

  tom whirled pneumonia he cried
his eyes lighted joyously  pneumonia
great stuff do you think theres a chance
vince

  vince looked at him in amazement
 youll have to have a tub sir fresh
pajamas you would be sick-

   oh i say im all right

   no you must have a bath a warm
bath

   i wont

  vince look at tom warningly  do you
wish me to summon archibald sir

  tom surrendered  no no ill bathe
vince lead me to it

  when he was abed again bathed and
clad to vinces taste he grinned and wait-
ed vince had given him an idea

  he waited till the house should lie quiet
again hoping that vince might fall asleep
and in the waiting he fell asleep himself

  the first glint of daylight woke him
and he remembered his resolution pneu-
monia not a minute to be lost he
leaped out of bed careful to make no sound
that would bring vince he began those
exercises once more he continued them
until he was red-hot

  the steel shutters on toms windows were
not kept closed now the island itself was
a sufficient prison he flung up the win-
dow and looked out over the sea and let
the cold morning breeze bathe his panting
lungs pneumonia that would save him

   i hope i get it good while im getting
it he told himself  ive heard it some-
times weakens the heart maybe time im
through with it my heart will be no good
to sleen any more heres hoping-

and he shivered bravely in the breeze
he waited all that morning for a fever
to develop but none appeared he was a

discouragingly healthy specimen in the
afternoon he gave up hope of pneumonia
and dropped back to overexertion again
vince was with him and he stared in sur-
prise when tom began his callisthenics

   whats the matter sir he demanded
 are you-are you-

   im stale vince just getting in con-
dition tom informed him bending for-
ward strenuously  great stuff you ought
to-

  the door had opened and dr sleen stood
there tom grinned at him defiantly and
redoubled his efforts the doctor called
 stop tom kept on and the surgeon
with no more ceremony charged cornered
him clipped him helpless and held him
down on the bed  youre mad man he
chided  youll ruin your heart

    aim to tom told him lets see
you stop me

  the doctor frowned then he smiled
 fair enough he agreed  i see youre
a determined chap he turned and called
over his shoulder  vince get the chair
vince departed the doctor held tom
flat on his back tom writhed and then
surrendered vince returned rolling an
enormous invalid-chair of curious construc-
tion  call archibald directed dr
sleen and when goliath appeared the
doctor surrendered tom to him  put him
in the chair he told the giant and go-
liath lifted tom and deposited him in the
cushioned seat

  the doctor lifted a strap and deftly
buckled it about toms right wrist then
another at his right elbow a third about
toms shoulders under the arms the left
arm was similarly pinioned the legs were
gathered in and the doctor stepped back
and surveyed his handiwork

   i expected we might need that he re-
marked  had it made on purpose

   thanks said tom dryly

   vince will feed you hereafter youll
sleep in that thing it can be made into a
reclining chair youll stay in that-till i
need you

  tom tried to grin  just as you say
doc

   exactly dr sleen agreed  just as
i say


all-story weekly

   toms further captivity war- lacking in
incident archibald and vince fed him
forced him to eat when he was reluctant
ihe chair held him in it calm embrace
save for brief moments when with archi-
bald on one side anil dr sleen on the other
he was released and allowed to walk about
the garden the chair on such occasions
was wheeled to the elevator and taken to
the lower floor and tom was wheeled
bodily out into the open air

  he settled into a steady and concen-
trated effort to devise some escape he
thought of opening a vein bleeding himself
into a condition too weak for the operation
and he tried this that is to say he tried
to get near enough the window to break a
pane of glass and get a piece and cut him
self with it but he never succeeded even
in breaking the glass

  on the second day when his chair was
wheeled out on the veranda he took a
desperate chance and toppled it down the
front steps mis hope was that he might
be maimed bruised injured in some way
that would unfit him for the doctors uses
hut the chair perversely rolled down the
steps without touching -o much as the hair
of his head to the stones righted itself
and coasted down the graveled path to the
lawn without so much as a jolt

  even then ho did not surrender his
body was bound but his spirit was un
tamed and his grin was as broad as ever
hut fate and the passing hours were in
exorable

  came an evening when vince and archi-
bald showed symptoms of subdued excite-
ment when john t guhvorthy visited him
for the first time since his captivity had
begun and when at last dr sleen came to
examine him with new solicitude

  whats the excitement doc iom
asked him cheerfully - everybody- in a
whee to-night

   doctor sleen nodded  mr corpus has
arrived he explained seriously the tri-
umphant light of the scientist in his eye

   tom shifted uneasily in his bonds and
dr sleen bent and pressed his ear against
toms breast to listen to toms wheels go
round tom tried lo lean far enough for-
ward to bile the back of the doctors neck

 he longed lo be able to breathe fire like a
 dragon and burn the doctor to a cinder
 hut dr sleen stepped back after a mo-
 ment unscathed

    	youre in fine shape sir he ap-
 plauded

    thanks said tom  and now that
 corpus is on hand i suppose the party will
 begin id like to meet the old guy first

    the doctor smiled and shook his head

  im afraid that isnt possible any ex-
 citement his heart is in a delicate condi-
 tion iai understand-we have to keep him
 very quiet

    i see  tom assented then - do
 you think it  yelled it would do the trick
 for him ive got a strong voice

    i dont want to have to gag you young
 man for the short time that remains
 will you not be more docile

   the short time tom interrupted

 j-just how short

     the operation said dr sleen  will
 be performed to-morrow evening

    tom gulped then he took a deep breath

     in that case doc he grinned cheer-
 lully youll best be on your way i want
 some sleep

     cood night --aid dr sleen

   good night barked tom

chapter xiii

nil itiikk conk

 the day that followed was by ail odds
 the most painfully distressing of
 toms life he was gloomy and
 there was no cheering him vince tried
 every wile he knew without success and
 even goliath archibald beauregard took a
 hand he came in and told tom a funny
 -ton and laughed tremendously at his own
 jest but tom did not join in his mirth

    this was at -i oclock in the morning
 tom had not slept during the night and
 by the same token neither had vince so
 lar as iom ever discovered vince never
 slept he appeared at a moments notice
 at any hour of day or night and always
 he was fully clad neat calm and quiet
 even in the midst of the mental perturba-
 tion of that last dav tom found time to
after his own heart

wonder how vince did it and he asked the
valet for an explanation vince smiled
with pride

    it is a part of my art sir he ex-
plained

   sure i know that but how do you
work it  might want to be a valet my-
self some day

    it is perfectly simple sir vince ex-
plained  during the day  am of course
always on duty at night when  lie down
for a bit of a snooze sir when  am likely
to be called i only remove my coat sir
 have a special coat that  wear at such
times sir the white collar and tie and
shirt-front are attached to it and when i
am called i need only to slip on this coat
button it up the front and button two but-
tons that fasten the shirt inside the coat
at the left side sir he demonstrated to
toms delighted interest

   like one of those things we used to
call a  dicky  tom commented but
vince shook his head

    no indeed sir the dicky is merely
a collar and shirt-front sir very unhandy
 was forced to discard them early in my
career

   i should think your trousers would
rumple

    i have trained myself to sleep on my
side with my legs straight sir thus the
trousers fall into the natural crease as i
lie and they look better when i rise than
when i lay down in them sir

   tom lost interest he was still buckled
fast into die reclining chair and the strain
of lying for so long in one position was
tormenting him he dreaded the passing
of the hours but he welcomed the coming
of daylight and breakfast because it meant
he could sit upright again he had given
up hope this past week of cajoling vince
the thing was not possible and goliath
was too phlegmatic to be moved by any
appeal tom could contrive his only
chance he knew now lay in a break for
liberty at the last minute when every one
would be concerned with the other party
to this projected transaction

  he wondered how judah b corpus had
spent the night i hope he didnt sleep a
wink he told himself

   	a-s



  the breakfast was delicious as vinces
breakfasts always were but tom could not
eat it he wasnt hungry he preferred to
sit still and listen to the throbbing of the
pulse in his neck he had never fully ap-
preciated his heart before but now that
there appeared to be no escaping its loss
he awoke to a real affection for the plod-
ding thing  always on the job he solilo-
quized  never watching the clock never
quitting never loafing old judah b will
get a good one if he gets you

  he shuddered and felt sick the skin
on his breast crawled and shrank as though
from the very touch of dr sleens knife
iom shut his eyes and the vision of that
knife became clearer so he opened them
again and held them wide open so long as
he could see actual objects imaginary ter-
rors would not harass him he dared not
even wink for fear that vision would ap-
lear again

  toward the middle of the morning dr
sleen came to examine tom he spent
half an hour in this occupation and at
length straightened up with a smile of sat-
isfaction on his countenance

   excellent excellent young man he
applauded

  tom managed to grin think im
prime do you he inquired

  splendid sir

   hows old jude

   mr corpus

   yes is he doing his share as well as
im doing mine

  dr sleen eyed iom gravely  he is a
very great man mr duncan he declared
 and he is a brave man he is submitting
to this perilous operation-i will not con-
ceal from you the fact that it is perilous
sir-with the highest fortitude he is calm
self-contained sure of himself he has
conducted his business up till yesterday
he has put his affairs in order he is resting
quietly to-day and looking confidently for-
ward to this evening

   thats all right tom protested  but
is this going to be a fair swap is he doing
his best to deliver the goods to me in prime
hape

   well- of course his organs are im-
paired young man but i feel i can prom-


all-story weekly

ise you that with proper attention to your
health you will some day be almost as well
as ever

    you promise that do you

    barring accidents yes

  oh barring accidents what kind of
accidents

   dr sleen held up his hand  you must
understand sir that when we undertake to
divert the circulation into new channels we
take chances

    oh youre taking a terrible chance
doc i pity you dr sleen i really do
the surgeon was not a whit abashed
 thank you young man i trust how-
ever that my hand may prove as steady
and as sure as it has always been in the
past i trust so for your sake my friend
tom felt seasick but he grinned dr
sleen departed with a final bland explana-
tion  i must go now and rest he called
 i wish to be very calm and cool i shall
not see you again mr duncan until this
evening

    well i dont wish you any hard luck
doc tom called after him  but if you
choke to death on your dinner ill see tot
you get the best funeral in xew york
state

   dr sleen smiled his appreciation of this
jest waved a large hairy hand and was
gone

   after lunch vince suggested casino but
tom snarled at him vince hovered over
the captive attentively  perhaps i can
read something to you sir

    sure tom assented indifferently  go
ahead and read

   er-and-er-what shall i read sir
   anything

   vince turned to the shelves it was evi-
dent that he was not a reading man he
called over his shoulder presently  heres
a book about flowers sir

    all right tom agreed  read that
 its called  the black tulip sir
tom did not hear his thoughts had
drifted off leaving vince far behind and
he did not give the little man any further
attention until a chance phrase caught his
ear vince had come to the scene which
describes the murder of the brothers by the

 dutch mob and he was reading it with
 unction the blow the knives the hot
 flesh hawked about the streets for pen-
 nies-

  stop tom shouted and vince raised
 a startled countenance  thats not about
 flowers thats no kind of a book to read
 to a man who-to a man that-to me-
 vince was blankly apologetic  i beg
 your pardon sir i judged by the title
 and then when i began to read i was so
 engrossed that it never occurred to me-
 if i was out of this blasted chair
 tom vowed  something painful would oc-
 cur to you in half a minute what do you
 think i- vince im surprised at you
 youve failed me youve wronged me
 you are heartless vince-heartless and
 i thought you were a kindly man

  i do beg your pardon sir i really do
  i can never forgive you vince

  quite so sir but i do beg-

 tom interrupted vince

  yes sir

  youve made me unnecessarily misera-
 ble vince

  yes sir

  its only fair that you should do some-
 thing to soothe me vince to calm me
 vince hesitated  thats-thats very
 true sir

  vince-is the young lady still here

  oh my orders sir-

  is she here vince answer me or say
 nothing you are a hard man vince

  oh no sir my heart is tender and-
  is she here vince

 vince struggled visibly between duty and
 desire and at length he fell  why-yes
 sir

 tom fixed the valet with his eye  vince
 im a dying man

  oh no sir

  i am vince i know it

  i hope not sir

  vince would you refuse anything to a
 dying man

  not-not willingly sir

  then vince do this go to the young
 lady beg her to forgive me for dragging
 her into this tell her good-by for me
 and tell her vince that i shall always
 love her
aftkr his own heart



  vince was in a terrible dilemma the
perspiration stood out on his forehead he
trembled

  to do what tom asked was to violate
his orders was to invite the vengeance of
gulworthy and that vengeance led to
the chair but not to do what tom asked
was to violate every impulse of vinces own
heart anti as he had proved more than
once he was a tender-souled and senti-
mental man he loved to bear such mes-
sages as this such messages particularly
as the last sentence of this message such
words thrilled him

   he turned to tom   will do it sir
on condition that you do not betray me

  tom grinned - and groaned  dead
men tell no tales vince he said dolefully

     will do it sir vince promised he
summoned goliath to stay near tom and
himself went on his way

  half an hour later he returned he
looked mysterious and important and he
sent archibald from the room and bent
over tom tom looked up at him hungrily
 well he asked

    i told her what you said ir

  	what did she say

  	her message was brief sir hut it
was-

  what was it man what was it

    she said sir- and vince straight-
ened and repeated in a parrotlike tone
i do au rev air and  too

   tom stared    do lit revoir and
i too he repeated  what does that
mean

    you forget your message to her sir

   my message-

    there were three divisions of your mes-
sage there are three divisions of her reply
sir may i explain

  go ahead quick man

   you said  beg her to forgive me
she says  do you said  good-by
she says au revoir you said-  vince
blushed happily  ah sir have you for-
gotten the last clause of your message

   no of course not and her answer-
tom remembered her answer and his eyes
lighted eagerly  vince he commanded
 shake me by the hand

  the valet shook tom s manacled hand

warmly and torn cried  vince youre
an angel thanks immensely now-let
me be quiet and think vince

  vince fell obediently into an inconspicu-
ous and shadowy presence haunting the dis-
tant corners of the room and tom
thought over and over sallys message and
drew from it a promise that had escaped
vinces notice vince had an eye for senti-
ment a romantic word obscured all else
from his view but not so iom tom
was in love but he was also practical he
had said good-by she replied ah
revoir and tom felt instinctively that
she would not have used that hope-arous-
ing phrase without reason

  so there was still a chance he would-
he was still absorbed in these pleasant
retlecdons when vince served dinner and
he was so checred by this chance of a last-
minute reprieve that when vince and beau-
regard released him from the chair and
politely bade him don pajamas he obeyed
without dissent

  it was only when he had incased him-
self in the silken garments that he realized
their significance and then he took it cheer-
fully  these are like the black suits they
put on in the- he exclaimed but vince
shuddered and cried out

   ah sir i pray-

   i beg your pardon vince tom apolo-
gized  i forgot your sensitiveness on
such topics  

  the door into the hall slowly opened
and through this opening a man appeared
this man was dressed in a long white
cloak and white bandages enshrouded his
head and the lower part of his face he
was unrecognizable and he looked like a
ghost he walked into the room and be-
hind him came a long narrow padded
plank mounted on wheels like a cart an-
other man similarly clad pushed this con-
trivance they entered in the most pro-
found silence they were like nothing so
much in the world as a pair of executioners
and tom shuddered

  vince touched his arm  they are
ready for you sir he reminded tom

  for an instant tom hesitated  should
he right take the last slim chance-
risk it-


all-story weekly

  but archibald closed in behind him and
tom stiffened himself and grinned and
shook vinces hand  g-by vince he
said  youre a good fellow take care
of yourself

   i hope i shall take care of you during
your-er-convalescence sir

  tom shook his hand again  thats sure
some hope vince i hope so too

  he shook hands with goliath  youre
all right archie he told the giant
youre there forty ways

   ya-as said archibald and crushed
toms fingers to a pulp tom was glad to
escape from him he turned to the two
men in the white robes

  what do i do now he asked

   lie down on this said one man and
indicated the padded cartlike contrivance
tom eyed it with repulsion but he obeyed

  it was a few inches longer than he a
few inches wider when tom had stretched
himself on his back upon it the men deftly
buckled a strap about his ankles another
about his waist they caught his wrists
into buckled loops and they drew tight
another strap across his chest tom
grinned good humoredly and wondered if
his heart was going to break his ribs with
its pounding

  when he was secured vince opened the
door and the two men-one at either end of
the cart-wheeled tom into the hall they
went along the hall and then into the
elevator

  going down tom called  by-by
vince

   good-by sir vince shouted from the
door of the room

  the elevator began its descent

  the elevator sank from the third floor to
the first but one incident marked that
short journey at the moment when they
were passing the level of the second floor
tom caught the sound of voices

  they were strenuous voices and they
were upraised in a violent altercation and
one voice was the voice of sally

  these voices came from some closed room
on the second floor tom caught a word
or two

  you shant you shant do it
this from sally  ill have you arrested-

  and then the voice of a big man in a
towering rage the voice tom decided of
judah b corpus the answer

   be silent say no more i am de-
termined if you make trouble you will
regret-

  the elevator sank below the floor level
and the voices were cut off tomgrinned
cheerfully at least sally was keeping up
the fight and to the last minute he won-
dered how she had managed to see old
corpus-

  the elevator stopped the cart with
tom as burden was wheeled out into the
hall along the hall and so at last into a
room that dazzled tom

  this room was white as snow the
rubber tires of the cart rolled on a white-
tile floor the walls were of white tile and
the ceiling in the center of the ceiling a
cluster of a dozen huge incandescents shed
a blinding light down upon those in the
room there were other lights on the walls
a solid row of them

  directly below the ceiling cluster tom
by turning his head could see two white
enamel tables with glass tops they were
set side by side like twin beds and tom
grinned and thought  one for jude and
one for me there were white buckets
and basins beside these tables and there
was a set of glass shelves close at hand
on these shelves glittered an array of
nickel-plated instruments that gave tom
the creeps slender knives needles
scissors-

  they had wheeled his cart against one
wall of the room and the two men who
had brought him went out and returned
presently in new white robes stiff and
fresh besides these two there were three
other men in the room all wore the white
shrouds all were unrecognizable by reason
of gauze bandages bound across their
mouths and noses

  two of these men wheeled a little glass
table the size of a tea cart over to where
tom lay on this table there lay a large
cone-shaped contrivance with an opening
in the top of the cone filled with cotton
and gauze and beside this cone there was
a can the label turned the opposite way
from tom
after his own heart



  but he knew what that can contained
you couldnt fool tom and lu- tried to
sit up   say he protested  i dont
want any ether ive got nerve i want
to see whats happening dont try that
-tuff on me i wont stand for it

  one of the men said soothingly  there
dont worry this will just dull the
pain a little youll he able to watch the
whole thing its all right-quite all right 
they waited they seemed to await
some signal and presently it came came
in the shrilling of a bell so near where tom
lay that he almost jumped out of his bonds
the two men moved  now said one

  he set his finger on toms pulse the
other lifted the cone and pushed it firmly
down over toms face it covered eyes and
nose and mouth

  tom waited holding himself still with an
effort for a moment nothing happened
then he smelled something something
not unpleasant at the same lime he felt
a little stifled he breathed deep again
again he could not seem lo get any air
he said as much in a muffled tone

   i cant breathe he mumbled  i cant
breathe take it off a minute

  the cone was not removed that made
tom mad he writhed in his bonds and
then he realized that he was losing con-
sciousness he knew that was a mistake
they had told him so he shouted  hey
im going under im going under hey
take it off take it- take- it--

  he couldnt shout any more he couldnt
get his breath but just then the cone was
lifted for a minute tom was perfectly
conscious he couldnt see any one but
he was conscious he heard sounds

  some one lifted his eyelid and such a
simple thing as that toppled tom off the
brink of the conscious world and he fell a
million miles into feathery oblivion

chapter xiv

a jolrney in th i kk

it was twelve minutes past nine oclock
j in the evening when tom war- put under
ether

two hours and seven minutes later or

at nineteen minutes past eleven a man
came out of the corpus cottage on the is-
land and ran down through the garden
paths to the boat-house

  this man was large a momentary
glimpse of his figure as he emerged from
the lighted hall showed thick hair on the
backs of his hands showed the unmis-
takable silhouette of dr sleen

  dr sleen ran down to the boat-house
like a man who is pursued he looked
over his shoulder as he ran and he ran
swi ftly

   in the boat-house alongside the slip lay
a big power-boat dr sleen jumped into
this boat he pressed a button that lighted
an electric bulb above her engines and in
this light he began to work on the engine
making numberless adjustments he
worked in haste his usually deft hands
were clumsy bungling he dropped things
and picked them up again with difficulty
but his impatience and anxiety found no
vent in words i le worked in a feverish
silence

  three minutes after he emerged from the
cottage the mansion two other men came
out the front door and then two more
and then three

  the second pair of men pushed between
them a long narrow padded plank
mounted on two wheels like a cart

  there was a mans limp body buckled
in place upon this perambulating plank

  four of the men lifted the cart bearing
the body down to the garden path then
the two who had pushed it out of the
house turned and went back inside in
the hall they paused for an instant looking
at each other furtively said one

    i hope theres no slip

   god- me too the other agreed

  outside the group of men were trundling
the cart down the path toward the boat-
house they went slowly carefully easing
the wheels gently over every roughness in
the path when the limp body lurched
to one side or another in its bonds the men
toward whom it lurched shrank instinctively
away

   they reached at last the slip beside the
boat-house they pushed the cart out on
this slip one man in front another behind


all-story weekly

  one of the wheels slipped off the edge
it overhung the water the cart tilted that
way

  the men caught it dragged it back to
safety it was possible to hear them
breathe deep with the relief of the rescue-
one of the men wiped his forehead with his
handkerchief

  dr sleen climbed up out of the power-
boat for all the terror and excitement
under which the big man was laboring he
dominated this group of trembling men
he spoke to them in whispers clapping
them on the shoulder heartening them

   guhvorthy and archibald and i will
do it he told them  you dont need to
worry at all this is our job its up to
us to take the risk you gentlemen take
the other boat-its ready to run-and land
wherever you like

  one man stammered  where are you
going

   just as well you shouldnt know can
one of you run the other boat

  one of them said he could dr sleen
waved his hand  all right go along
the rest of you well manage now
they accepted the dismissal with obvious
relief and climbed into their craft and
chugged away dr sleen watched them go
then he turned to the two men who re-
mained with him one was john t gul-
worthy the other was archibald in the
reflected light from the little bulb above
the power-boats engines guhvorthys face
showed white and wet with a cold damp of
terror archibalds tiny countenance on
his huge body was as calm as that of a cow
to complete the simile he was chewing
something that pleased him and his ex-
pression was blissful

   brace up gulworthy dr sleen ad-
vised  you ought to have taken a drink
 i d-did gulworthy asserted

   oh i mean a real drink

   i had two t-t-tumblers of brandy
sleen stared then he laughed  its a
wonder youre not dead

  gulworthy shuddered gripped the doc-
tors arm  gods sake sleen thats
an awful word dont you-

  the surgeon laughed gulworthys ter-
ror had given him confidence he looked

at goliath  you dont look scared archi-
bald are you

   ya-as 

  scared what about why well
take care of you

   ya-as archibald admitted calmly
 ya-as i think maybe you will that
might be nice

   exactly sleen agreed  weve got
to protect you to protect ourselves

   ya-as said archibald again
guhvorthy touched the doctors arm
 c-cant we get s-s-s-s-started he begged
 im cold

   right the surgeon assented he bent
over the body on the cart then changed
his mind  archibald you unbuckle-
him ill get the boat ready you lift-
him down in

   ya-as said archibald and he bent
above the cart and fumbled with all his
thumbs for the buckles dr sleen and
gulworthy climbed down into the boat
guhvorthy prowled the length of the craft
like a dog seeking a bed and at length went
inside the tiny cabin and huddled on a
bench that ran along one side

  archibald freed the body from its buckles
and came with the limp thing in his arms
and handed it down to dr sleen the
surgeon bore it into the cabin and laid it
on the bench across from where gulworthy
sat the lawyer stared eyes wide and he
asked pitifully

   are you going to leave it-

   right there dr sleen assented
 and-if we should happen to be ques-
tioned-or anything-hes asleep drunk
understand

  gulworthy backed to the door  i-
ill stay out here he decided and he
retreated to the stern and crouched there
all the little mans dapperness was gone

  archibald was methodically casting off
the boats moorings and at last he jumped
aboard her and took a boat-hook and
pushed her free of the slip dr sleen
started the engines they churned ahead
with slowly gathering speed

  the water began to boil under her bow
they swung in a circle and headed straight
for the distant shore dr sleen was at the
wheel guhvorthy crouched in the shadows
ai ikk his own ii kart



aft archibald sal near dr sleen and
chewed like a meditative cow

   after an hours run the fast craft swung
up to a mooring in sheltered waters where
others like her doted the darkness all
around they moored her and then dr
sleen and archibald silently and with the
utmost care lifted die limp thing that lay
in the cabin and lowered it into the tender
that the motor-boat had dragged astern
archibald took the oars gulworthy sat in
the tenders bow and dr sleen astern
sheltered the body from any chance lance
in his own shadow

  gulworthy called once timorously
 suppose your cars gone doctor

   its not dr sleen assured him i
drove it here myself locked it in my own
private garage that ive had here for years
-since he bought the island it will be
there

   i-hope s-so

  it was they landed and while archi-
bald and gulworthy stayed in the boat with
the body dr sleen ran up the street to
his garage presently the car itself rolled
down to the pier and gulworthy sighed
with relief

  archibald lifted the body up till dr
sleen could catch it and carry it to the
car gulworthy climbed after it and
archibald made fast the boat and followed
chewing silently at the car gulworthy
begged  iet me drive dr sleen

  the surgeon laughed  i wouldnt let
you drive a pair of snails across a billiard-
table in die present slate of your nerves
get in

  he haif thrust gulworthy into the
tonneau the top was up and the cur-
tains were closed so that the interior of
the car was black dark gulworthy stum-
bled over a limp foot and when he sat
down he found dr sleen had propped the
body up to share the seat with him archi-
bald sat down on the other side of the thing
it lolled between them the car started
with a jerk and a roar and the head
dropped on gulworthy s shoulder he
stifled a scream

  half-way to the city they blew out a
tire and dr sleen had to replace it gul-
worthy and archibald climbed out to watch

the process and after a lime gulworthy
commented shiveringly

 a terrible end to this night dr sleen
the doctor looked up and nodded
thoughtfully   had expected this night
would make me immortal gulworthy in-
stead- 

  he shook his head and archibald said
soberly  ya-as i think so

  sleen looked at him  you think what
   oh ya-as just think about it

  the surgeon laughed  its all right
archibald dont worry yourself about it
the giant shook his head  you might
worry he suggested mildly

   i might sleen agreed  but  dont
propose to do you gulworthy

  gulworthy lifted protesting hands
 dont talk man ilurrv it will be day-
light--

  sleen screwed the last nut in place and
thumped the new tire  all right get in
im ready

  their ride began again

  by and by they entered the outermost
purlieus of brooklyn and rode cheek by
jowl with the early-flitting milkman through
the empty streets across the bridge and
swiftly up-town the first faint hint of
dawn tingeing the eastern skies and so at
last they ground to a halt

  they had halted before a boarding-
house the establishment of mrs gall
where once tom duncan had dwelt it was
still dark and chill dr sleen stepped out
of the car and tipioed up the front steps
and tried the door with a key

  it opened he left it slightly ajar and
descended to the car again

    youll go first gulworthy he directed
see that the coast is clear ill follow
with archibald to help me

  the lawyer protested feebly  theres
no need of my going i-

   were all in this dr sleen insisted
grimly  come move the house will
be awake in an hour and for heavens
sake go quietly

  gulworthy nodded

   you know the room sleen asked

   yes i helped in the original search

  	all right go on

  gulworthy falteringlv climbed the steps


all-story weekly

to the front door he pushed the door open
and looked inside he listened

  then he turned and beckoned for his
companions to follow and stepped inside
the house

  the two big men lifted the limp body
out of the car between them they gripped
it by the shoulders and bore it so as though
their burden were half-conscious with
dragging drunken feet

  they crossed the sidewalk climbed the
steps entered the hall

  gulworthy was half-way up the first
flight they followed him

  they went upward endlessly it seemed
to dr sleen he was perspiring trem-
bling desperately afraid every door they
passed was an ambush from which he ex-
pected an accuser to appear he caught
his breath each time a door was safely
passed

  they were fortunate on this upward
progress they woke no one and thus they
came at last to the door of tom duncans
room gulworthy opened the unlocked
door and entered the two followed with
the limp thing between them they laid
it gently down on the bed dr sleen bent
over it stood up at last his countenance
ghastly his foot kicked against some-
thing and he looked down and saw the
corner of a trunk and he gripped gul-
worthys arm

   some ones taken this room he whis-
pered fiercely

  gulworthy shook his head thats-
his i had it sent back as soon as we-
had him

  dr sleens strength returned to him
 oh-all right have you got the en-
velope-the letter-the-

   yes gulworthy drew something
white from his pocket turned to the dresser
propped this thing against the mirror

  the men backed toward the door eyes
fastened on the still thing on the bed they
passed out into the hall and the door closed
behind them dr sleen wiped his forehead

  they turned and went swiftly and fur-
tively down the stairs none barred their
way the car engine purring awaited
them the street was empty

  they leaped in even archibald scram-

bling with haste the car plunged they
were gone

chapter xv

the awakening

a billowy sea of black water a sea
of black water which was strangling
and stilling him and he had for-
gotten how to swim his efforts were dis-
jointed hopeless frantic they drove him
under the water again and again he
choked and coughed and sighed

  suddenly a bird began to sing he could
not see the bird but he could hear the
song it was lively gay tinkling it was
like the sound of well attuned bells ringing
in concord

  at first thi- sound was pleasant then
it grew louder it was incredibly persistent
it became a jangling tumult it was deafen-
ing him he tried to swim to escape it-
and he sank into the black waters of ob-
livion again

  but this oblivion was no longer absolute
even while he slumbered in it he heard
things they were indefinable but they
persisted and then he drifted to the sur-
face and his face came out into the open
again he breathed he heard the ljell-like
songs

  the black water solidified under him he
found it was solid earth on this earth he
ran wildly to escape the jangling bells
the land was strange he had never seen
it before there were houses but they
were unfamiliar

  the pursuing bells drove him into one
of them he burst into a strange room and
then he turned around and around and
saw a girl standing at the door of the room

  the girl was sally so tom knew it was
time he awoke and he opened his eyes

  he shut them again instantly shut them
and groaned they hurt they burned
they were like hot coals and he could see
nothing with them the pain was sicken-
ing he began to feel sick seasick he
would not have opened his eyes again for
the world

  so lying with eyes closed heaving with
billows of discomfort tom drifted back
after his own heart



to consciousness the first thing that
identified itself to his senses was the cot on
which he lay his hand hanging at one
side of the cot touched the iron bar of the
frame a tag was tied to tne bar here and
he felt the string and thus knew the cot
was his own he was lying he understood
in his own bed in his own room at mrs
galls

  therefore of course he was dead he
was sure of this without being sure why he
was sure and the certainty was soothing
so that he slipped back into a half-sleep
half-stupor once more this stupor per-
sisted for some little time and during this
interval the sun climbing higher peered in
at the window and scorched his leaden eye-
lids

  regretfully at length he approached
consciousness once more his stumbling
thoughts began where they had left off
he was in his own bed in his own room
therefore he was dead why why did
this conclusion necessarily follow he
groped for an answer to this puzzle and in
the end he found it

  they had told him that if he died they
would take him to his own room and leave
him there with a suicide note upon his
dresser

  he turned his head weakly and opened
his eyes and peered toward the dresser
he saw the white oblong of an envelope
propped against the mirror this confirmed
his first conclusion he was dead and
need trouble himself no more about the
matter

  but with the slow flooding back of his
senses this conclusion no longer satisfied
him there was a flaw in it somewhere
he could not locate this flaw at first
though he considered the situation very
painstakingly

  but in the end he remembered if he
died they were to leave him here with a
note on the dresser and a knife in his
breast

  he could feel no knife in his lungs as he
breathed the good air tasted very sweet
and clean and he felt sure that if there
were a knife blade there it would hurt him
to breathe to make assurance doubly
sure he lifted one hand weakly and passed

it across his breast it struck nothing
found the hilt of no weapon-

  he frowned with annoyance a pretty
mix-up either he was dead or he was not
dead lie had a right to know but how
was he to find out--

  there was no one he could ask he
must solve the mystery to the best of his
advantage

  how

  he decided to sleep a little while-he
was very sleepy-and investigate this other
trilling matter at a later date and so he
slept

   while he slept this time the influence of
the drug left him when he awoke only
a numb head and a dry mouth remained to
distress him he awoke lazily and opened
his eyes and saw the familiar objects
among which he had lived and abrupt-
ly he was wide awake perfectly conscious
remembering everything that had befallen
him up to the moment when some one
tweaked his evc-lid and he dropped into
oblivion

  he sat up in bed swung his feet to the
floor caught the reflection of himself in the
mirror

  and suddenly an appalling thought
struck him his heart it was gone it
must be gone else how came he here

  he struck his breast he felt no pain
there he ripped open coat and vest and
shirt and examined the smooth white skin
he went over his left side minutely refus-
ing to be convinced there was no scar no
mark of the knife no wound

  yet he could not have escaped them-
not after that ether cone closed down on
him they must have had their will of
him

  his back perhaps they had abstracted
his heart through his back he tried to
feel for a scar there but his contortions
were unsatisfactory he could not cover
the ground he must see

  he ripped off his garments baring his
torso and he strode in front of the mirror
and turned his back to it and twisted his
head to look over his shoulder into the
glass he turned his body back and forth
inspecting it minutely

  it was sound whole his back and

chest were alike innocent of knife-scars
ergo his heart was still there

  even then he could not believe he
pressed a hand to his chest and could feel
no pulsation he tried his pulse fumbling-
ly and his eyes lighted with triumph iiis
heart was still beating

  it was only then that tom fully accepted
the fact that he was alive alive free
some miracle lie had no curiosity as to
the details ii was enough that he was
free

  he threw himself on the bed and lay
there on his back gloating over fate lie
was free

  and then he sat up quickly they might
come for him again they might have
brought him back here for some purpose
of their own he was in danger so long as
they knew where he was lie must escape
elude them travel lie wished himself
in saskatchewan

  and he set about the task of getting
there with all the vigor that was in him
wriggled into his clothes discovered his
trunk and made sure it was packed stuffed
odds and ends into his bag

  it was when he gathered up comb and
brushes to drop them in the bag that he
saw tle letter he had forgotten it but
there it lay leaning against the mirror
staring up at him it was addressed to
him the address typewritten he read
this address aloud dully

thomas duncan

ow york

   now that he told himself sapiently
 that was delivered by hand the post-
office doesnt know me as well as all that
i know

  and after a moment  and as far as
that goes  must have been delivered by
hand too he grinned    bet archi-
bald had a share in that even the parcel-
post would balk at me

  he turned the envelope over saw that it
was sealed tore off the end pressed the
edges to force it oen and looked curiously
inside

  it was a large envelope and he saw now
that it was well filled with money yellow
bills his heart began to pound he

slid the contents of the envelope out upon
the top of his dresser the bills were bound
together in a sheaf he picked them up
and counted them twice

  there were forty-nine bills of the de-
nomination of a thousand dollars and there
was a careful selection of smaller denomi-
nations which brought the total to another
thousand tom made sure of his count

   fifty thousand he said huskily
 i-fifty thousand and he grinned
well-thats fair tom

  he realized then that a letter had lieen
enclosed with the money it lay unnoticed
on his dresser he picked it up and un-
folded it and read

dear mr duncan 

  this should more than compensate you for any
rouble or loss of time to which you may have
been subjected you will he wise to content
yourself

  if you go about your business with a closed
mouth you will hear no more from us if you
undertake to pursue the mailer to investigate to
prosecute you will suffer things far worse than
those you have escapcd

   i feel sure you are a wise young man

signed john x smith

  this letter as well as the signature was
typewritten and there was a postscript
which read

   if you propose o be discreet write yes on
he back of this sheet and mail it lo john x
smith general delivery grand central post-
office

  tom held up his right hand and took
oath to his image in the mirror that he was
content

   im satisfied he swore  ilum satis-
fied never again

  and he turned over the letter wrote
 yes  on the back of it slipped it in an
envelope addressed the envelope and
thrust it in his pocket to be mailed

  as he did this some one knocked heavily
on the door

  tom was paralyzed for an instant then
he acted he swept up the heap of bills
on the dresser jammed them into his pock-
et pulled the smallest chair within reach
of his hand put himself on guard and
called

   come in
after his own heart



  in the doorway appeared the form of
archibald

chapter xvi

saliy pim again

wfiex tom saw archibald in the
doorway he was profoundly glad
there was a chair within reach he
snatched it toward him swung it into the
air and brandished it above archibalds
poll

   get out he commanded  get out
ill smash you never again goliath
avaunt 

  but archibald only grinned stupidly and
moved to one side andthis movement re-
vealed close behind him sally pirn

  tom lowered the chair and gasped
sally-a very serious and sober sally-
said quietly  its  tom dont hurt
archibald

  tom grinned  he brought you here
i feel like kissing him

  she smiled a little faintly but-
tom-if you must kiss some one-

   i must  he vowed and threw the chair
across the room and did while archi-
bald watched benignly

  sallys arm was around toms neck she
patted his shoulder softly  im so glad
youre safe tom she whispered  i was
so worried-

   i was a dog to get you into it

  oh she laughed and stepped back
a little  i was never in any danger

  he shook his head you dont know
that bunch

   oh yes i do tom and besides
she turned to the giant  archibald i a
friend of mine he brought me your letter
and he was looking out for me-and for
you too he would have saved you at
the last minute in any case but i hoped
to do it in another way persuasion-

   persuasion is no good with that
crowd

  she nodded soberly  i found that out
tom

  he turned and looked at goliath and
grinned and stuck out his hand  no
hard feelings archibald

  archibald shook his head slowly

   you dont mind this young ladys-
   that might be nice said archibald
  oh-you give vour consent then

archibald
u-as

   shake

  they shook and then sally touched
goliaths arm  wont you wait down-
stairs archibald she suggested  tom
and i-

   archibald grinned ponderously lifted an
elephantine hand nodded his tiny head

  ya-as-i know he declared and so de-
parted

  when the door was closed tom caught
sallys hands he was full of his own story
and it burst from him  i havent had a
chance to tell you and youd never begin
to guess do you know why they had me
out there

  sally started to speak but tom rushed
on  they spotted me the day you gave
me the picture because i was husky and
your friend gulworthy kidnaped me and
offered me a million dollars for my heart
modern surgery all that-

   the girl touched his lips lightly with her
hand to silence him and thus provoked an
irrelevant interruption of some minutes
duration and when they returned to the
subject tom demanded can you be-
lieve that its the fact sally ilonest
i believe it she told him i-i
know it is all true

  he stared at her you know its true
how how did you get away from the
island anyway how did you find me
here

   she smiled at him softly  will you let
me tell it-my own way

  he chuckled  if you dont mind my
interrupting-

  she evidently did not mind neverthe-
less between these interruptions she told
the story

   it was mr corpus who was to have-
a bit of your artery tom she said

   i know

   oh-they told vou that

    yes

   they must have been very sure of
success


all-story weekly

  they claimed to be

 she nodded   did not know that at
 first she said u not when  came to the
 island not till i had talked with archibald

  you see tom- i-  know mr corpus
 quite well i thought he was fond of me
 and when archibald told me the thing
 they planned to do  thought i could per-
 suade him to give it up and i waited

  he would come to the island the day
 before  wanted to see him then but
 they would not let me the next day just
 before he was to go to-the operating-room

 he sent for me

  sent for you

 yes to his room on the second
floor

i heard you tam cried while
they were taking me down in the elevator
 heard you arguing with him you
little-

   did my best tom but-i failed
 he refused to give up the plan when i
 persisted he flew into a terrible rage
 he-

 some one buffeted the door ami tom
 opened it and saw goliath  i think you
 might like a nice paper  said archibald to
 sally and handed her the one he had
 brought  so i buy it

  thank you archibald

  ya-as said the giant and backed out
 again

 sally looked at the paper and tom saw
 her flush and then turn pale and she
 looked up at him

  what is it he asked  anything
 wrong

 she held out the paper to him  anger
 was-deadly for mr corpus she said

the

                 u

 softly you the rest of the story is
 there

    tom took the paper and spread it out
  before him and his heart leaped with
  surprise

    for half across the page a head-line
  read

judah b corpus dead

magnate stricken by heart disease on eve of
operation

    tom read this and stared at the girl
   thats what saved me he whispered

    she nodded  yes and after a mo-
  ment she rose and came and stood beside
  him and pointed to the paper again
   there is the rest of the story she said

    tom followed her eye and saw what he
  had not seen before in the middle of the
  page was a large photograph of the million-
  aire and below and at one side the picture
  of a girl a girl who was indubitably
  sally pim

   below this picture was printed the
 legend

miss sakaij im corpus

magnates adopted daughter and sole heir

    when this had come home to him tom
  dropped the paper and turned slowly to the
  girl and there was awe in his eyes but
  there was none in hers she cried softly
   we were never anything to each other-
  he and i im just an ordinary girl tom
  dont be afraid of me

    and a little later tom was saying  i
  swore i wouldnt sell my heart to a corpus
  but sally-i might be willing to trade

     its a bargain said sally pim

west of the solomon islands in the
south seas is the island of savo
-a three days run in a schooner
after rounding cape astrolabe savo used
to be a resort for the head-hunters of those
regions and traders and missionaries still
fight shy of it the near-by islands of
malaita and guadalcanar belonged to
great britain but savo belonged to king
channa

  king channa was a small dark islander
who wore a white flax wig and carried a
four-foot basket shield and spear he was ex-
pert with the spear also treacherous which
is probably why the pile of skulls outside
his hut numbered a round score instead of
channas skull decorating the hut of one of
his henchmen he was afraid of nothing
except his own tabu which was that he
must not touch fish all his life he had
dreaded the sight of fish

  skipper william mckechnie vouches for
this and mckechnie encountered channa
during the affair of the sweet alice and the
mongava pearl

  mckechnie was master and half owner
of the trading schooner auld alfred he
was a scotchman past copra pedler and
pearl trader who knew the by-ways of the
south seas like a book hence it was not
surprising that a few days after he heard of
the wreck of the sweet alice on savo he
headed his schooner for that place

   it was late in the afternoon that the auld
alfred beat up to the north shore of savo
and slipped cable in a convenient cove
within bowshot of the wrecked sweet alice

gordon the sandy-haired mate of the
schooner joined mckechnie on the after
deck after he had seen to the anchor and
together they scanned the wreck on the
beach in silence

  the sweet alice lay on her port side
forty yards beyond the waters edge where
she had been driven by the force of the
hurricane which had splintered her star-
board rail and snapped her foremast her
deck-house was crushed in and she bore
unmistakable signs of pillage by the savo
islanders the hurricane that had wrecked
her had taken the lives apparently of
dixon her master and ilallie her mate-
the only two white men aboard at least
such had been the report mckechnie heard

   gordon man observed the weather-
beaten scotchman at length  if ye can
ease a thought out o your sandy head con-
sider yon wreck anti tell me what is strange
about it

  the mate puffed tranquilly at a rank
pipe and closed one eye in pretended medi-
tation

    she lies high mr mckechnie he
hazarded  but the surf must have topped
the beach to the etlge of the bush during
that tempest hallie lost his life trying to
swim the surf with a life-line before she
broke up

  skipper mckechnie shook his head
sadly

   the good book says mr gordon
that there are them who have eyes and see
not ye have put your muddling finger
dead to the rights o the matter still ye see


all-story weekly

nothing strange as ye said hailie who
was a decent man was lost in the surf
dixon who was a scoundrel-having shot
more than one harmless heathen for his
amusement besides kidnaping the brother
o channa-stayed on the vessel with the
crew the report says that he was
drowned one o the crew escaped to
malaita with the tale

   well and why not demanded gor-
don

  	why not do ye ask me that xo
doubt ye think dixon drowned himself in
the watcr-cask o the cabin out o repent-
ance for liis sins when he saw the lord was
about to take him cast your eye over the
wreck yon

  mckechnie pointed a blackened fore-
finger at the hulk on the beach

    will ye notice mr gordon that the
tale goes dixon was drowned when the
vessel broke up ye will notice no doubt
she is not broken up if dixon had stuck
to his deck he would be alive this day

   me might have been washed over the
side by a comber mr mckechnie ob-
jected gordon who loved an argument
 have you the testimony on oath of st
peter that the man was not washed over
the rail which was splintered by the
crash

  mckechnic scanned the bulk of the
wreck with shrewd eyes

   oh aye he grunted  i need no
word from the saints if dixon was swept
over the side did all the crew follow him
out o love for the man that fed them
lousy tucker and strung them up by their
thumbs xo mr gordon if ye had
brains instead o ballast in your top-
hamper ye would know that if any o her
company had stuck to the sweet alice they
would have lived for she is not broken up
and dixon was no man to risk his life
when others would serve instead

   the scotchman swept his arm across the
vista of the shore

   what happened to him when he
reached the beach where is he now
gordon where is he

    a look over the bloomin tub might tell
us what you want to know mr mckech-
nie suggested gordon

  by way of answer the skipper pointed
toward the bush gordon surveyed the
shore through binoculars and saw what the
shrewd scotchman had noticed- the glint
of spear-points among the ferns and an oc-
casional dark form that slipped from one
palm to another the men of savo had
sighted the schooner

   we had best wait until the commis-
sioner sends the thor here mr jordon
said mckechnie  the gunboat is headed
this way l heard at malaita the british
navy is fast becoming curious about the
death o dixon and the unlettered heathen
o savo then we may do a wee bit in-
vestigating for ourselves the while

   the curiosity of a decrepit scotchman
is a sad thing to my way of thinking mut-
tered jordon addressing his pipe

   curiosity is it mr gordon mc-
kechnie eyed his mate hostilely  aye it
may be that but what if i tell ye dixon
had on him the mongava pearl

  gordon had heard of the pearl-a beauty
of great size and purity that the native
divers of mongava had brought to the sur-
face

   the malaita traders told me the tale
went on mckechnie  dixon bought it
from the unlettered heathen o mongava
for two pound when he had them sweating
drunk on the sweet alice man it was
robbery but it cannot be proved im
thinking the mongava pearl is worth five
hundred pound in sydney and more in lon-
don aye dixon had the pearl and we
will find him or his body on the island o
savo

  darkness closed rapidly over the cove
and the woods of savo a white line of
gentle surf marked the shore between
this line and tin bush came forms invisible
in the darkness forms that carried shields
and spears they gathered in a group by
the wrecked schooner watching the riding
lights of the auld alfred but when dawn
streaked up over the sea they were gone

barclay sat in a wicker-chair under the
awning on the after deck of h m s thor
channas tabu



and wished that he had a better cigar than
the one he was smoking also he wished
that he could penetrate the secrets hidden
behind the bush of the beautiful island of
savo

  the commander of the gunboat was a
square-shouldered man of perhaps thirty-
two years with a fresh tanned face and
mild blue eyes as he puffed at his cigar
a frown creased his brow it was late in
the afternoon and the heat had seeped in
under the awning and into every quarter
of the old gunboat the brilliant green of
the foliage that lined the beach shadowed
the clear blue of the sea a few cables
lengths away the auld alfred was tran-
quilly at anchor opposite the war-ship
the wreck lay on the shore some distance
above the water-line

  barclays eyes swept the scene which
had grown familiar idly puffing smoke-
rings at the awning overhead he ran over
in his mind the scanty fruits of his visit to
king channa

  the thor had been ordered to savo-
which the trading schooners avoided on ac-
count of the evil reputation of the place-to
learn how dixon and hallie had met their
death and if possible to recover their
bodies also to salvage whatever valuables
were on the wrecked sweet alice including
the mongava pearl which malaita traders
asserted dixon had with him barclay
under orders from the commissioner was to
settle the question like english navy men
throughout asian waters barclay was an
unlisted court of appeal against crime a
judge of the unwritten law it was his task
to see fair play

  yet barclay saw little chance of recover-
ing the pearl king channa interviewed
at his village by the englishman with a
party of marines had confirmed the story
of the survivor of the sweet alice who had
come to savo from malaita on the thor

  the sweet alice declared channa
through an interpreter had struck the
beach of savo during the climax of a hur-
ricane and the one boatman had been the
only man to win ashore the terrific wind
and the high surf had prevented the island-
ers from giving aid to the stricken ship
some bodies of the native crew had been

washed ashore later that was all noth-
ing had been seen of the two white men of
the schooner

  channa and his spearmen had been in
high good temper plainly flattered by the
visit from the war-ship they admitted
when barclay pointed out that the vessel
had been looted that they had taken the
ships furniture and fixings but there had
been no cargo as the sweet alice was in
ballast at the time homeward bound for
sydney xo one had appeared to claim the
vessel so they had helped themselves

  not content with this barclay had made
a thorough inspection of the sweet alice
followed by a search of the island which
was small-being a scant ten miles around
no trace of the white men had been found
he was forced to admit to himself that
there was little for him to do at savo he
had not even found the ships papers of the
sweet alice

  barclay knew of the evil reputation of
savo-of the head-hunting spearmen he
had seen the treasured pyramid of bleached
skulls before channas hut but the skulls
were old and the deeds of the savo men
belonged to a time before the coming of the
british

  one curious thing he had seen in talk-
ing with channa he had idly flicked a dead
fish which lay on the ground between them
toward the king with his foot instantly
channa had sprung back his eyes wide
with terror the action had alarmed the
spearmen and for an instant there were
prospects of a free-for-all fight between the
islanders and the marines barclay had
quieted the disturbance wondering at the
fear of channa for a dead fish

  the commander of the thor looked up
as he saw a boat approaching the war-ship
from the schooner the boat drew up be-
side the gunboats ladder and a few min-
utes later the stalwart form of skipper
william mckechnie strode aft

  the scotchman greeted the naval officer
calmly and appropriated a chair beside
barclay he sniffed at the smoke from the
latters cigar doubtfully and drew a cigar
from his pocket barclay eyed this and
the weather-beaten face of the bald scotch-
man curiously


all-story weekly

   thi is no so bad mr barclay mc-
kechnie extended the cigai and by the
smell o the one ye have ye might relish a
change tis a failing o my male mr
iordon to smoke ihe weeds  saw ye go
up to channas village this morning when
i was visiting the sad remains o the sweet
alice how did ye like the bonny island o
savo with its canny king

  barclay exchanged cigars readily ami
when the new one was alight ran his eye
appraisingly over the skipper

   may i ask he inquired  who you
are and what your business is at savo

   ye may ask responded mckechnie
agreeably stroking his whiskers with a
stubby hand  and welcome my name is
william mckechnie master o the auld
alfred yon my business at savo is no-
body elses business

  the officer turned his blue eyes to the
scotchman who met them frankly he
had heard of the master of the auld alfred
who bore a record for honest but crafty
dealing

   may  ask resumed mckechnie
calmly  what ye have learned from
channa about the fate o dixon and ilallie
im thinking thats why ye are here mr
barclay

   dixon and hallie were drowned
theres nothing further for me to do at
savo the sweet alice is a dead loss-
cant be salvaged 

   aye mckechnie continued to stroke
his whiskers  no doubt ye would think
that now will ye tell me mr barclay
who the native was that went with ye up
to channas village

   that was the survivor of the sweet
alice crew

   aye and did ye see the scar on
channas cheek mr barclay

   yes i did the commander of the
thor glanced at his visitor impatiently  
say is there anything more you would like
to know mckechnie

   there is the scotchman nodded
gravely  do ye see nothing strange
about the death o dixon

   i do not i shall list him as drowned
with hallie have you any suggestion to
make mckechnie

  the scotchman did not miss the mild
sarcasm of i his but his expression did not
alter

    might suggest if ye ask it that ye
consider three things mr barclay king
channa who is afraid o nothing except the
tabu o fish also the scar on his cheek and
die man ye picked up at malaita do ve
know where he is sir

  barclay sat up and ran his eye down die
deck when he had last seen the islander
the latter had been asleep in the shadow of
a gig the man was not there however

   the good book says went on mc-
kechnie  that by their acts ye shall know
them the unlettered and benighted
heathen is a canny man mr barclay and
will bear watching the fellow ye are look-
ing for saw me come aboard the thor if
ye look ashore ye will see him yon
mckechnie pointed to the beach to his
surprise the officer saw a dark form rise
from the water and run ashore the man
ran leaping in zigzag fashion as if to dodge
possible bullets barclay recognized him as
the survivor of the sweet alice

   i had a good look at the boy on deck
before he slid over the side mckechnie
explained  he wore a half-moon o pearl
shells which is a sign o caste on savo
that boy is one o the savo men and 
doubt he ever saw the deck o the sweet
alice unless he helped to loot her he saw
me watching him and he considered it was
time to slip his anchor

  i say barclay frowned then the
beggar was spoofing me

   aye no doubt he was twas a
canny move o channas to send one o his
men to malaita with the tale that all on
the schooner were drowned now ye
marked the scar on channa sir well im
thinking it was a bad day for dixon when
his vc-se drove ashore here that scar
was dixons doing the time he carried off
the kings brother to queensland tis bad
luck to speak ill o the dead but dixon was
overquii k to shoot when he was in the labor
trade- getting islanders to work in queens-
land and channa has a long memory
he remembers how dixon cut a pearl from
the mouth o his brother when the poor man
tried to hide it
channas tabu



   rot barclay shrugged his shoulders
skeptically  do you mean to say that
channa has taken to head-hunting again
and that he killed all the men on the sweet
alice

   did ye see sir mckechnies bun-
thickened with excitement  that a the
ships papers was missin from the schooner
the unlettered heathen canna read where
did the log and papers go if dixon did not
carry them ashore ye hae na dealt wi
the benighted islanders so lang as i-

   but nothing can be proved argued
barclay puzzled  ill go ashore and find
that beggar however-

   ye will not find him sir nor will ye
find the bodies o dixon and the rest
channa has taken care to put them in a
canoe filled wi stones and sunk the lot at
sea

   then whats to be done mckechnie
the scotchman stared thoughtfully at
the woods of savo which were now void of
sign of life

    if ye will wait for a day mr barclay
he observed   will go ashore and inter-
view channa the king is a verra interest-
ing man with his collection o skulls-if he
can be made to talk

  barclay shrugged agreement after all
as mckechnie said he could do nothing
except to shell the village on suspicion and
he was not willing to do that

iii

  the village of savo was a short distance
back in the bush out of sight from the
beach leaving their boat-crew on the
beach with the gig mckechnie and
gordon struck into the bush-trails on the
following day the mate was armed with
his revolver mckechnie carried a small
bundle but no weapon

  they had no difficulty in locating the
village where the savo men were gathered
all armed their appearance look the
islanders by surprise the king of savo
was sitting in front of his hut and he
sprang to his feet grasping his spear when
he saw the two white men seeing that
they were alone however he resumed his
seat

   	a-s

  the savo men clustered about them as
they made their way to king channa mc-
kechnie showed no signs of alarm he
knew that as long as the women and
children of the village were near them the
men would not annoy them

  the ruler of savo was a small man but
muscular one cheek bore a deep scar and
a shoulder-blade protruded where a spear
had wounded him in the back he wore his
tawny wig of flax and a woven ditty-bag
hung from the pearl-shell belt at his waist
his small bleared eyes watched the new-
comers closely

  mckechnie seated himself unconcerned-
ly by the pile of skulls beside channa
gordon took his stand at his back leaning
against the bamboo hut both men were
alert for trouble but for the present they
knew that the curiosity of the natives was
more powerful than any desire to attack
the white men mckechnie busied himself
in turning over various presents to channa
-tobacco knives and a pipe the eyes of
the savo chieftain glistened when he saw
his visitor draw a pair of handcuffs from
the bundle channa knew the use of the
implements having had dealings with the
queensland recruiters in his youth

    you like em this good fella asked
mckechnie holding out the handcuffs to
channa the latter assented cordially and
extended his hand for them

   you work em like this channa con-
tinued mckechnie calmly gordon backed
slowly against the hut and his hand went
to his pocket he little liked this expedi-
tion into the savo headquarters but mc-
kechnie had insisted on coming and gor-
don would not let him take the risk alone

  the natives thronged closer mckechnie
drew the key of the irons from his pocket
channa had not withdrawn his hand the
skipper clamped one of the bracelets over
his own wrist with a quick motion he
snapped the other half of the irons over the
islanders wrist

  channa started angrily but mckechnie
paid no attention to his movement the
skipper reached into his bundle a silence
fell upon the gazing spearmen-a hostile
silence in it mckechnies hand came
forth from the bundle it held a dead fish


all-story weekly

  as his eye fell on the fish channas angry
yell echoed through the village mc-
kechnie balanced the fish near the native
his eyes wide with terror the native
strained back but the handcuffs held him
to mckechnie gordon had drawn his re-
volver and now faced the ring of islanders

   listen channa mckechnie growled
at the struggling native  this fish is tabu
you touch em fish you catch em seven
devils and die like- dont move or ill
rub it on your arm tell your boys to keep
back or marster gordon will shoot em
plenty quick

  the terror that gripped channa brought
beads of sweat to his forehead he shouted
to his followers who drew farther away
watching the scene the while with rolling
eyes channa had been brought up from
childhood to dread the sight of fish which
he was convinced would send him to imme-
diate destruction he had never been so
near the object of his tabu and his fear
knew no bounds

   now resumed mckechnie  ye and i
are going to have a palaver channa
dont reach for that spear unless ye want
to touch this fish first ye can tell me
what happened to dixon if ye lie ye will
feel the fish

  channa protested that he knew nothing
of the master of the sweet alice but a near
whiff of the hated fish loosened his tongue
speedily

   marster dixon him plenty bad fella
he cried  long time him come along
savo him take my small fella brother
along queensland my small fella brother
him die along queensland marster dixon
him give me this -channa pointed to his
scarred cheek so far mckechnie knew
that he spoke the truth

   then come schooner along savo
channa hurried on his gaze fastened on the
fish as on a deadly snake  marster
dixon come along village after hurricane
him drunk like seven bells my word
him tell channa his good fella mate got
drowned along hurricane him shoot three
times at my hut my small fella sister she
catch bullet and die-

   and ye speared dixon eh queried
mckechnie

  channa assented frankly reaching
over to the pile of skulls he rolled off the
ones on top in the center of the moud
the severed head of a white man showed
scarred and bruised mckechnie recog-
nized all that remained of dixon he
shook his head sadly channa glanced
from the head of his enemy to the man who
held him prisoner something like pride
replaced the fear in his eyes iride and
anxiety lest he lose his treasured trophy

   so ye killed dixon mckechnie
mused  what about the crew o the
schooner

  channa his gaze still fastened on the
blood-stained head replied that they had
fled in a boat to guadalcanar when dixon
was killed

   i believe ye arc telling the truth
channa said the white man  especially
as ye offer proof the killing is none o my
business but ill take the big pearl ye
found on dixon-the mongava pearl
channas glance turned to mckechnie
and traveled back to the head

   marster dixon him swallow that big
fella pearl he said slowly

   but ye cut it out o him channa 
the king hesitated briefly then he put
his free hand into his ditty-bag he pulled
out a pearl large and lustrous mckechnie
took it from him silently and in spite of
channas wailing protests he took the head

  on board the thor that evening mc-
kechnie told his tale to barclay as a
climax he unwrapped the scarred head that
he had brought from savo barclay shud-
dered

   i suppose well have to shell channas
village for him mckechnie he decided
 cant let these fellows take to head-hunt-
ing again but i wont waste many shells
on him im half convinced dixon got
what was coming to him by the way did
you see anything of the mongava pearl
mckechnie held out the big pearl that
had come from channas ditty-bag

   channa gave up this he said  it
must be what ye want ill take dixons
head and give it a decent burial at sea if
ye wish

  barclay was glad enough to let the
skipper attend to this task when me-
channas tabu

kechnie and gordon reached the cabin of	slightly with a wild cry he reached two

the auld alfred the former placed his grim	lingers inside

burden on the table	the next instant he held up a round ob-

 hard luck we had to give up the pearl	ject the bewildered gordon saw that it

mr mckechnie said gordon with a wry	was a great pearl blood stained but of

are you mad	 the mongava pearl gordon cried

mckechnie was tugging at the jaw of the	mckechnie  aye channa was sorry to

by will thomas withrow

                       ijk lived about te same as most men live

                            about like other men he did his bit

                       he gave to life about what most men give

                       but never did he make a three-base hit

                      home-runs were not his forte he jogged along
                      as most men jog and merely held his place

                      so at the finish he was not among

                        those present at the winning of the race

                    he was an average man-like you and me-

                      his life summed up was neither good nor bad

                       and his concept of virtue was to be
                       content with what he was and what he had

                    and then he died-about as most men die-

leaving no footprints on the sands of time

                      and soon his tombstone lied-they always lie

                      to speak the truth of dead men twere a crime

                       here lies -so that mendacious tombstone said-

                        here lies -that much of what it said was true-

                        here lies the crumbled clay of one who led
                       in doing good to whom great praise is due

but all who knew him knew the tombstone lied

                       they knew hed led in nothing good or bad

                       that all the praise hed earned was when he died

                     and all the good hed done was to be dead

                      so you and i will soon be dead so too

                        our tombstones will set forth in kindly lies
                        our many  virtues which in fact were jew

                         theyll boost our reputation to the skies

                       a man who couldnt get a decent job

                        or credit for a ten-cent loaf of bread

                        can get a handsome six-line lyric sob

the arrest of larry conover

  in over-enthusiastic salesman in dem-
j onstrating david carrolls car had
l fervently attested to its ability to
do upwards of sixty miles an hour as car-
roll with leverage at his side headed down
highland road toward the city in answer
to jim sullivans urgent summons he very
soon learned that the salesman had exag-
gerated

  for carroll clamped down on the accele-
rator until the sides of his shoesoles ca-
ressed the floor of the car and the speed-
ometer climbed slowly to fifty then fifty-
one and gradually crept up to fifty-two
miles per hour beyond which it declined
to go

  eric leverage teeth tight shut and eyes
staring with real fear clutched desperately
at the top uprights and prayed that the mo-
tor had developed its maximum even at
the fifty-two miles at which the salesman
would have sneered as a mere snails pace
the roadster bade fair to leave the road
turn on its side and die peacefully

  it swayed drunkenly as it shot ahead as
a too hippy person walks it zipped from
one side of the road to the other and slued
breath-takingly before answering to the
firm hand on the wheel

  carroll never a speed demon at best
was driving as he had never driven before

  once a boulevard motor-cycle policeman
overhauled them after a chase which
brought delirious cheers from the children
playing on the highland road lawns and
was keenly disappointed to learn that he
had been chasing his police superiors

  the detective sat at the wheel his face
set as though graven in marble muscles
tensed to the strain eyes riveted on the
broad macadam roadway which unwound
like a great endless ribbon beneath the
whirring wheels

  on they sped with never a let-up save
at important crossings where there was
danger of meeting street-cars they whizzed
on with the motor sending its staccato roar
into the still air the special siren whistling
eerily and the wind whipping into their
faces

  it seemed as if the sky-line of berkeley
citys civic center came jumping toward
them leverage lost all sense of motion
he held grimly to his seat too terrified for
verbal protest and not until they had
reached the environs of the city proper did
carroll slow down to a respectable gait of
twenty-five miles

  leverage leaned back and drew a breath
of relief

  facing the prospect of combat with a
cornered convict with a calm matter-of-
factness he had been petrified with fear at
an exhibition of fast driving wherein he had
been deprived of even the exhilaration of

handling the wheel and as they struck
into the more crowded streets of the city
itself he mopped nervously at a face headed
with cold perspiration and accounted him-
self lucky to be able to answer  present

  they struck straight through the city
skirting to a back street that they might
not strike the midday traffic jamb and kept
going toward the banks of the muddy river
which loops in its course on one side of
berkeley city and furnishes a sluggish
source of water-power

  on the near bank of that river a noisome
tenement district had long since sprung up
and flourished like a fungus growth fran-
tic efforts of civic improvement associa-
tions chambers of commerce and city po-
lice to the contrary notwithstanding

  the slum district radiated from a partic-
ularly vile section which was known as the
 hells half acre and the half acre itself
was a mecca for crime and criminals such
as few cities of triple berkeley citys popu-
lation could boast

  in the half acre could be found the scum
of the states criminal element it was an
executive headquarters for past masters of
the under-world arts its committee meet-
ings were held in a half dozen disreputable
rooming-houses which displayed signs pro-
claiming to the world that they were
 hotels

  one of the quietest and most vicious of
these hotels was carters a three-storv red-
brick structure on a dirty saloon corner
carters had been headquarters for the
lefty lewis gang for the infamous pete
hardwick gang of train-wreckers and a
dozen other bodies of criminals who had
sought immunity from the police in organi-
zation

  carroll was not unfamiliar with the dis-
trict as he drove his car slowly between
lines of street vendors through a maze of
dirty romping children and on into the
reek of the half acre he felt that sullivans
warning that he come armed had not been
misguided

  patrolmen operate in pairs in the half
acre and as carroll parked his car a block
away from carters hotel he summoned
the two men on the post and gave them di-
rections

    chief leverage and i are going into
carters after a man i want you two men
to stroll down that way casually after we
get inside one of you keep a view of the
front and the other get around on the side
street and watch the side door if you
hear any excitement-shooting for instance
-come on the jump up to the third floor
keep your eyes peeled for a chap making
a getaway if you see him get him-pref-
erably without shooting-but get him

  they nodded and saluted one of them
saw fit to throw in a friendly word of
advice

   got your rods handy he asked

   yes

   keep em so chief thats a plumb
nasty place inside

  a crowd of the unkempt and curious had
gathered carroll raised his tone to cam-
ouflage pitch and said  and so well be
very much obliged if you officers will keep
an eye on this car then he and leverage
cut across the street and started down to-
ward carters

  the block on which they walked was a
canon of towering brick tenements scarred
on their fronts by rickety rusty fire-escapes
populated with slovenly housewives and un-
washed children the city street-cleaning
department had been laying down on the
job on this particular street although the
street-cleaning department would have of-
fered in extenuation that it could do noth-
ing the entire section needed disinfecting

  the entire street floor of the carter ho-
tel was used to house a collection of steamy
little shops and the entrance to the hotel
itself was through a door over which hung
the dilapidated sign

  entering this door carroll and leverage
their hands occasionally touching the butts
of their revolvers by way of reassurance
mounted a seemingly endless flight of un-
believably narrow oilcloth-covered stairs

  at the top they found themselves in a
boxlike square in one corner of which was
an old table two chairs and a greasy book
which evidently did duty as a register

  a slatternly woman slouched forward
and inquired their business in tones which
bristled with hostility the men were far
too respectable-looking to have business in


all-story weekly

carters hotel which could be of benefit to
that institution

  leverage flipped back the lapel of his
coat displaying the shining detectives
badge fastened to the lining the woman
flashed him a sour glance

   well whadaya want

   nothing except that you keep your
mouth shut about our being here there
are a couple of uniformed bulls down-stairs
and if anything busts loose up here theyll
come a gunning

   nothins gonna bust loose here came
the sullen answer  unless yous fly-cops
bust it

   then you just sit tight an dont rock
the boat were not going to raise any
rough-house if we can help it see but
we dont want any interference from inside
now-wheres the other fellow

   the tall thin guy

   yes

   in th hall up-stairs gum-shoein
around 

  thats where this mr and mrs car-
son are isnt it

   guess so hes had th room fr a
coupla days

   and you just took it for granted that
the girl was his wife eh

   she said she was an i aint here to
look after the morals of the people that
comes to this hotel just get that in yr
bean y aint got nothin on this joint in
that line-r any other fr that matter

   worse luck retorted leverage cheer-
fully then turned and led the way up a
second flight of steps even more viciously
narrow and dark than those leading from
the street to the pseudo lobby

  at the poorly lighted landing at the head
of the stairs they met jim sullivan and
that individual was frankly glad to see
them

   ive been scared stiff he admitted
frankly  this aint the kind of a joint
id choose for a pleasure pariv what i
dont see is how the devil a ill a decent-
looking as ellen garrison is could ever
have nerved herself to get inside this place
 conover commented carrol briefly
 theres no limit to what a woman will do
for the man she loves this for instance

    she couldnt do more agreed sullivan

   have they gotten wise to the fact that
youre here asked leverage

   sullivan shook his head

    i dont think so at least they havent
tried any funny stuff theyre talking in
there but i cant hear what theyre saying

i havent tried to start anything i was
willing to handle anything that broke but
getting under way before you got here-
that sort of stuff isnt in my line if i can
worm out of it

   you havent seen the man have you
queried carroll

   no

   so youre not sure-

    im sure of nothing chief except that
the man in that room is the man who was
with ellen garrison in the quincy house
night before last

   youve been on the job jim whats
your plan of campaign

  to get conover

   yes

   well-it struck me chief that we
ought not to get him any more excited than
we have to whether he killed old man
quincy or not being an escaped convict as
he is there isnt much hed stop at to get
away from us its a cinch that the girl
has financed him and fifty to one that hes
heeled

   i figured that if we busted into that
room by the time we got there hed be
backed in a corner with his rod handy and
ready to do business hed either pot one
or both of us or wed have to get him and
that- he shook his head  would be right
unpleasant

   very agreed carroll  and your
preventive for this

   seems like we might mosey down the
corridor and stand very silent outside of
 s sooner or later the girl will get ready
to go-sooner im thinking shell open
the door right gently and take a peep to
see that the coast is clear if we bust in
right then we can get him covered before
be can say  boo and then we can talk
turkey

   good idea approved carroll heartily
 what say you eric

   knowing what i do about this dump
the crimson alibi



grinned the plain-clothes chief  id say
that the less rookus we raised the better
off well be its open season on cops when
gunnin starts down here and while i aint
running away from it when ive got it to
do-id rather handle things tactful-like
as jim here suggests

   its a go then approved carroll
ill stand on this side of the door-frame
and you and leverage stand on the other
side keep flattened against the wall and
leave it to me to start the ball rolling

   no gun-play unless there isnt any way
to avoid it theres always the chance
you know that larry did not kill the old
man and we know that hes innocent of
ihe fairchild  co robbery for which he
was sent to the pen so we dont want to
kill him unless we have to

   innocent gasped sullivan in surprise
leverage told him briefly the story of lefty
lewiss blanket confession and when he
finished sullivan shook his head commis-
eratingly

   the poor fellow he said i if he did
kill quincy-i dont blame him

   and now said carroll softly  lets
get on the job theres no telling when
that door will open and we want to be
right on the job when it does keep your
guns out

  silently as ghosts they moved down the
carpeted hallway and took their positions
against the wall on either side of the door
marked-in chalk- then commenced
a vigil that took all the moral and physical
stamina they possessed

  inside the room they could hear the mur-
mur of voices low tense and vibrant oc-
casionally a meaningless word floated to
their ears and was lost in the dinginess of
the hallway after they had been there x
for fully three-quarters of an hour-which
seemed to them to be three hours-they
heard a choky  good-by in a mans voice

  the three men shifted tensely and took
tighter grips of their revolvers leverages
jaw was set grimly sullivan was plainly
nervous-only carrol showed no emotion
although had the light in the hall been
brighter one might have seen that his eyes
had lost their habitual blue softness and
had assumed a cold steel glint his slen-

der frame was taut in every muscle he was
poised on the balls of his feet as a runner
poises before a dash

  the good-bys within the room were long
and punctuated by the sound of a womans
sobbing carroll flashed a message to sul-
livan-flashed it by means of his eyes and
an expressive gesture which was to the ef-
fect that sullivan should take it on himself
to see that the girl did not escape or cause
the trouble which a desperate cornered
woman can easily cause

  a key grated in the lock of room no
 then there was silence carroll
eyes fixed with hawklike intensity on the
door-kncb saw it turn slowly-very slowly
finally the door swung back and a wo-
mans voice came to them plainly the voice
of ellen garrison- good-by sweetheart
the door opened slightly it opened
wider the girls shoulder appeared-
thrust cautiously out to see that there was
no one in the hall and then carroll gave
the signal

  sullivans hand was clapped tightly over
the girls mouth he held her motionless in
bis steely grip at the same instant car-
roll sprang through the open door to face
a young man who stood motionless-
stunned with surprise

  hands up carrolls voice snapped
like a whip-lash his revolver was trained
on the heart of the pasty-faced young man
who stared at him in mute horror eric
leverage ranged himself beside carroll and
the hands of the cornered man rose slowly
ceilingward carroll heard leverage say

   weve got our man chief thats larry
conover

chapter xxl

a dark prospect

the man was larry conover but even
eric leverage hardened as he was to
the pasty colorless flesh of the peni-
tentiary inmate experienced a sense of
shock he remembered larry as he had
been on the day of his trial and conviction
broad healthy alive with ruddy color ex-
uding vigor and sheer animal spirits and
now-


all-story weekly

  a tall man with white skin drawn tightly
over jutting cheek-bones eyes deep in the
sockets and staring as from a skull hair
clipped short and shoulders sagging

  ordinarily leverage would not have
been compassionate but as he looked at
what had once been a magnificent man he
was struck forcibly with the idea that it
had all been unnecessary the conviction
the prison term and the consequent red
stain of murder

  the magnificent spirit which had been
conovers four years before was gone
after the first impulsive movement toward
the window-three stories above the flagged
pavement-he turned toward them the
light of the cornered rat in his sunken eyes
he shrugged his shoulders with a pitiful
helpless almost appealing gesture

   well he questioned and paused

   weve got you at last larry

  a pitiful wail broke through the tense
silence of the room ellen garrison broke
from jim sullivans grasp and threw her-
self sobbing in the arms of the escaped
convict

   oh larry-larry boy it is all my
fault i-i-thought he was asleep-and
he wasnt

  he stroked her hair gently and un-
ashamed tears sprang to his eyes  there
there little girl you did everything you
could perhaps its just as well we would
never have known a moments peace
youve been a little wonder-woman dont
cry dear

  but she clung to him passionately
shaken with a paroxysm of sobbing

   it isnt right larry-it isnt right
you-you-dont understand theyve
come to arrest you for-for-the murder
of mr quincy

  he nodded hopelessly

   i understand that dear there isnt
any use fighting against it theyve got
me and theyll railroad me through just as
they did before-

  leverage stepped forward his voice
was very gentle

   listen to me larry conover we
came after you and we landed you because
we had to but i want you to know fhat
youve got friends in the three of us-

 yes- bitterly  swell friends
whats this a new sort of third degree
 i dont blame you for being sorry-and
im sorry as hell that you croaked old
quincy

    but i didnt with sudden vehemence
of passionate denial  before high heaven
i didnt

    id give a pretty if you could prove
that larry but the cards are all against
you-

    just as they were before

    yes-just as they were before but if
we have anything to do with it theyre
not going to get you for murder man-
slaughter maybe - something easy like
that-

    id rather theyd hang me said the
man dully  than send me back to that
pest-holc im glad old quincy is dead
but i didnt kill him any more than i
robbed the fairchild safe you were on
that case leverage you didnt believe i
was guilty

    no larry i didnt believe you were
guilty and now i know that you were
not

  i you know it what do you mean
 no longer than two hours ago a no-
torious yegg confessed that he robbed the
safe at fairchilds that cleared you-
larrys head went back his nostrils
dilated and the breath whistled through his
thin white lips the full significance of
his position flashed through his mind

   good heavens he exclaimed  when
youve got my neck in a noose you tell me
that you know i was not guilty in the first
place when youve got me dead to rights
on a murder charge you tell me im clear
of the burglary offense

    i got railroaded to the pen for a crime
i didnt know a thing about- escape to
have the freedom that belongs to me-i
happen to be in his house when hes killed
-and now im going to be sent up for life
is that just is it fair doesnt the law
ever try to make amends for its mistakes
if you knew all that why couldnt you play
hands off why couldnt you strain a
point and let me go aint there a single
heart in the whole pack of you law-hounds
 and why did you have to go tell me
the crimson alibi



this i wouldnt have minded it so terribly
much if id thought that the old conviction
was still hanging over me he faced ellen
and held her at arms length  you hear
that sweetheart they tell me they know
i never robbed the fairchild safe-they
tell me after theyve got me framed on a
murder charge a jter-not before 

   vve didnt know it ourselves till a few
minutes ago conover broke in carroll
 i pledge you my word well do what we
can to get you off murder is murder you
know

   it is to me said the man hopelessly
 it doesnt seem to matter much whether
im guilty or not

   you insist that you did not kill joshua
quincy

   if it was any use-

   did you kill him

   no i havent even seen him since the
day of my trial

   then questioned carroll  why did
you run the risk of hiding in his house day
before yesterday

   i guess maybe mr carroll if youd
been torn away from a three-weeks bride
and sent to the penitentiary-and if youd
made a getaway from there after four years
of hell-i guess maybe even you would
take a chance to be with her a little while-
wouldnt you

  carroll leaned forward he heard lev-
erage gasp  your wife

   of course

   ellen garrison is your wife carroll
was readjusting himself to this revelation
 since when

  the ex-convict nodded toward the girl
   show him dear

  from the bosom of her dress she drew
forth a folded paper which she extended to
carroll with quiet dignity it was a mar-
riage license dated three weeks before the
date of conovers arrest for the fairchild
robbery and pinned carefully to the back
of it was the certificate of their marriage
in whitfield a suburb of berkeley city
the certificate of marriage was signed by a
minister of whom carroll had heard

   why didnt we know of this he ques-
tioned of conover

   for the same reason i guess that you

didnt know about who really robbed the
fairchild  co safe answered conover
bitterly  but the fact is that ellen and
i were engaged and one evening we sud-
denly decided to get married we also de-
cided that ellen was to keep her job for a
while and so we thought wed better keep
the marriage a secret-

   why

    well-it sounds like a silly reason after
the real things ive been through for the
last four years but at that time i was
thinking that the boys at the store would
kid the life out of me if they knew my wife
was working as a house-maid it was what
i used to call pride in those days

   and then after they arrested me for
the robbery-and convicted me-i made
ellen promise that shed never tell that we
were married and with a touch of hau-
teur  i wouldnt have let her tell even yet
if it wasnt for the fact that every one will
know that there was a man in her room
yesterday and she wouldnt have a shred
of character left unless it was known that
the man there was her husband

   would you mind asked carroll
 telling us everything that happened day
before yesterday from the time you reached
her rooms until you got away

   no i guess there aint anything i can
say that will hurt me any youve got the
dope on me and while it wont help
any-

    i hope that it will said carroll
   conover looked at him peculiarly

   damned if i dont believe you do he
blurted

   we all do

   i was up there in the room all after-
noon knowing the first comfort id had in
four years i smoked-smoked real cigars
that ellen had bought for me i ate a good
dinner that she smuggled up from the
kitchen everything was fine until after
the dinner hour when the housekeeper
knocked on the door and insisted that some
one was in there

  where did you hide

   in the clothes-press ellen locked it
and hid the key

   but before you did that you put out
your cigar and threw it into the fireplace


all-story weekly

   yes and forgot it in the excitement
after that there was nothing for me to do
but lay low i fancied that mrs burrage
would be keeping an eye on that hall to
see if any one tried to get out of there
and then after we were sure that she had
gone to sleep i was afraid to try it because
ellen listening at the head of the steps
heard a quarrel between joshua quincy
and his nephew

  conovers hands were working spasmod-
ically as he talked his lingers closed
around a scrap of paper on the dresser and
he tossed it from him with his left hand
carrolls eyelids quivered slightly as con-
over continued

   i dont see how any one could have
helped quarreling with the old man i have
never seen a person so universally hated
but anyway they were quarreling bitterly
ellen said she held her post there wait-
ing for the young fellow to go out

   i guess it must have been quarter past
eleven oclock when he did go and then
she came to me and told me id better make
a try at getting out of the house unseen
we slipped down the hall and the back
stairs she led me into the butlers pantry
and turned on the light then she let me
out of the back door and turned the light
off

   i thought i was safe then the night
was very dark and i stood in the shadow
of the house trying to accustom my eyes to
the gloom all of a sudden i saw some one
come around the corner of the house and
i could see that he had seen me i made
a break for it-ran as fast as i could-
which aint so very fast after what ive
been through for four years-straight to
the back of the grounds through a clump
of bushes i vaulted the fence at the rear
ran to the next corner and hid there i
could see into the grounds and by the way
the man i had seen was looking around i
knew that hed missed me

   he looked all through the grounds and
then walked on around the other corner and
started toward the front of the house
conover stopped

   well and after that carroll prompt-
ed him

    i beat it straight down the street and

into the town and straight to this dump
where ive been hanging out under the
name of frank carson since i hit town

i	was planning to go west-ellen had
saved up and staked me-and after a while
when the excitement died down she was
going to join me but now he spread his
hands wide with a hopeless gesture  its
all off-

    listen to me said carroll gently  i
 want you to believe that i want to clear you
 of this murder-charge if you are innocent
 if you did it im going to send you up
 but if you didnt do it id like to see you
 get off will you do something for me

     what is it

    carroll produced a pad and a fountain-
 pen  sit down at that table and write a
 sentence for me

    conover shook his head in puzzlement

    i dont get you-

    just sit down at that table and write
 something for me

    what

     anything

    no one understood-least of all conover
 who suspected a trap but he instinctively
 liked carroll and finally he took the pen
 and paper seated himself at the table and
 wrote a sentence-wrote it with his left
 hand he rose

    now said carroll strangely wad
that up stand in the corner yonder and
throw it to me

    bewildered at the strange request and
 not understanding whither it led conover
 hesitated again but he did as asked took
 his place in the opposite corner and threw
 the wad of paper at carroll the throw
 was made with the left hand carroll
 caught the paper deftly and tore it to bits

  just so youll understand that it was no
 trap he explained smiling

 what was it then

  a little idea of mine thats all

    ellen turned on carroll

    cant you let him off she pleaded

 	you know he didnt kill mr quincy
 you know it  can see in your eyes that
 you know it-

 conover stopped her

  xo use sweetheart theyve got to take
 me in its better not to beg them
the crimson alibi



  thanks conover said carroll  i
 feel rotten enough about the thing now
 id hate to have to refuse her

 he turned on ellen

  i wonder if youd answer a question or
 two for me

 she glanced at her husband

  shall i

  yes

  first-this the detective quizzed
  larry says that you listened at the head
 of the steps to the quarrel between joshua
 quincy and his nephew is that correct
  yes sir i was sure that mr andrew
 would leave the house eventually and i
 knew that larry could get away then

  you heard most of the quarrel

  almost all of it

  did you see andrew when he went
 out

 yes sir

  what did he do what was bis
 manner

 she turned piteously to larry

  do i have to tell him she begged

 he nodded

  i guess wed better stick to the truth
 ellen

 she faced carroll again head back and
 conviction in every clear word

  its robbing larry of his last chance
 she said  but you heard him tell me to
 stick to the truth well-

  the truth is she drew a long breath
 then took the plunge  the truth is that
 mr andrew did not kill his uncle

  did not

 even carroll showed his surprise

  how do you know

  because just as mr andrew was going
 out the front door his uncle came through
 the library and shook his fist after him
  never set a foot in this house he said
 and then i saw mr andrew leave

chapter xxii

 fanshaw visits carroll-again

 two hours later three sober-faced
 men david carroll eric leverage
 and jim sullivan seated themselves
 before a tasty lunch in carrolls apartment

  freda bustled about the cozy little din-
ing-room afraid that some tiny detail tend-
ing toward carrolls comfort might have
been overlooked she was a bit frightened
-and considerably awed-by the graveness
of their faces

  even leverage whose chief delight in
life had seemed to be found in teasing
freda had nothing for her save a very brief
nod

  they ate in silence the fact that they
did not compliment her on the lunch did
not bother freda she could see by the
rapidity with which the food disappeared
that it appealed to their ravenous appetites
what she did not like nor understand was
the deep worry-furrow between david
carrolls eyes that and the tense set ex-
pression of his face

  it was not like carroll to show his worry
save for the sometimes steely glint in his
blue eyes he was wont to wear an expres-
sion of almost beatific placidity and so
freda worried because carroll worried and
carroll worried because things looked very
dark indeed for larry conover-and be-
cause the whole legal system which had
hounded larry unjustly and driven him to
the crime-now seemed to him to be utterly
at variance with the spirit of justice

  they had taken larry to the city jail
and ellen his wife had gone with him
there carroll had taken it upon himself to
place larry in a private cell comfortably
furnished-such a cell as that occupied by
andrew quincy-and to allow ellen to re-
main with him

  true a special guard was placed outside
the door with orders to listen for the slight-
est unusual sound from within the cell-
but at least larry and his wife were free
from prying eyes free reflected carroll
bitterly to share their utmost of misery

  carroll ate abstractedly he was swayed
by his instinct violently swayed in favor
of conovers innocence and yet joshua
quincy had been killed somebody had
murdered him who

  from the jail carroll had driven to the
quincy home and once more had gone over
the scene of the crime paying special at-
tention to the body itself the theory of
suicide he soon abandoned


all-story weekly

  he was convinced that quincy had been
murdered but by whom

  xot andrew quincy ellen herself had
cleared him

  xot by dorrington

  larry conover appeared to be the one
remaining possibility unless there was a
phase of the crime which had entirely es-
caped his notice

  he wanted to think to piece together the
loose threads which had floated to the sur-
face during the whirlwind course of his
investigation he rose from the table and
the others followed him into the study
which adjoined his dining-room they
lighted cigars and sat around like so many
bewildered owls

  suddenly carroll rose for the first time
in four hours he smiled jim sullivan knew
the signs

   got the answer chief

   i dont know-yet answered carroll
from the window without turning his head
 i dont know-not yet but- well
what do you fellows think talk it over
it  help me to get straightened out

   me said leverage heavily  im
damned sorry to say that it looks like larry
conover maybe thats because it has
looked like conover from the first but it
aint dorrington and it aint andrew
quincy-

   you believe what ellen said about
andrew that his uncle followed him
through the library as he was leaving
proving that he was alive when andrew left
the house you believe that

   as i believe that the sun will rise to-
morrow chief she certainly wouldnt lie
to save the only other man who might have
been guilty she wouldnt go around hunt-
ing for chances to put the noose around
larrys neck would she

   no-o

   surely jou dont think theres a chance
that andrew was the one

   no im convinced that it was not
andrew

   maybe you think it was dorrington
   xo i dont think that

   then in heavens name what do you
think

  im not sure larry conovers in a

tight place and im sorry for him sorry
all the way through id do anything on
earth to clear him suddenly his face
brightened

  by george  know who will help me
 out

-	who

  ever hear of roger fanshaw

  i have answered leverage instantly
  hes as good-natured a crook as ever
 walked free bucket-shop man gold-brick
 expert founder of ten dozen stock-swindling
 schemes-and clever enough to keep out of
 jail hes on the blacklist at headquarters
 but weve never landed him yet

  you ever hear of him sullivan

 yes-and unfavorably but nothing
definite

 hes been mixed up with joshua
quincy in several dirty deals hasnt he
leverage

  we think so in fact we know it-but
 quincy used him kept in the background
 himself trust a rotter like quincy to get
 some one else to do his dirty work but
 why all the fuss about fanshaw

  he knows a good deal about this case
 commented carroll  ill ask him to come
 here

 sullivan and leverage looked at each
 other and shook their heads in bewilder-
 ment as carroll lifted the receiver on his
 desk-telephone and called fanshaws num-
 ber in a few minutes a womans voice
 came to him over the wires  mrs
 burton

  yes

  this is mr fanshaws friend the one
 who was there last night remember

  yes indeed sir you wish to spealt
 with mr fanshaw

  hes there now

    yes ill call him to the phone

in a few minutes a deep voice came
booming over the wire

    this is fanshaw

  this is david carroll

  i guessed as much by what mrs bur-
 ton said where are you

  at my apartment

   anything new

 	plenty

 fanshaws voice quivered with eagerness
the crimson alibi



   got your man

   i think so i want to see you a few
minutes can you come over

  	there

   yes

    ill be there in twenty minutes

   good just ring three times when you
get here and ill let you in myself

  he put down the receiver and faced the
others

 surprises you doesnt it that im on
such intimate terms with roger fanshaw
 nothing you do surprises me com-
mented leverage  but what does it all
mean

   fanshaw was the first person to tell me
anything about the quincy case

   how does he know anything about it
 he was there announced carroll
calmly

   suppose suggested leverage  that
you spill the story thats what youre
driving at aint it

   yes

  carroll lighted another cigar and seated
himself in a big leather chair and then
he started with the arrival of fanshaw
on the previous morning and detailed to
them the mans strange story of his inten-
tion and plan to murder joshua quincy
only to find his intended victim dead by
the hand of some one else

  the two detectives listened spellbound
their eyes wide with astonishment they
fairly gasped when carroll reached the
dramatic end to bis recital

   the reason i havent told you this
finished carroll  is that i didnt want you
to be influenced by anything you might
happen to discover as a matter of fact
you found nothing against fanshaw
neither did i-except that ianshaw was
the man dorrington saw hiding in the front
of the grounds after he had chased larry
over the back fence

   that part of conovers yarn did strike
me as fishy commented sullivan  al-
though i didnt pay much attention to it
it didnt seem to matter much either way
and i never considered another person in
the case

   it was a natural oversight i doubt if
i would have paid any attention to it if it

hadnt been for the fact that i started in on
the case with fanshaws story in my mind
but as i say his alibi worked dorrington
did not see him-but it was fear that
dorrington had seen him which drove him
to come to me and ask me to get busy and
find the real murderer

   do you know carroll smiled  its a
fact that when i visited his boarding-house
last night i found his estimable landlady
ready to take an oath that she heard him
groaning from eight oclock at night until
about half past one the next morning and
now-what do you think of fanshaws
story

   me answered leverage  it seems
that every one who ever had anything to do
with the old geezer was jinxed not but
what fanshaw would have been willing to
kill the old bird its just a pity that some
guy like him whod be better off in jail
couldnt be sent up for it instead of a de-
cent guy like larry conover whose last
chance is taken away from him by the dead
man

  silence fell upon the group-a silence
broken suddenly by three whirs of the elec-
tric bell carroll left the room swiftly and
intercepted the girl

   ill answer it freda you go on back
to the kitchen he ordered

  he was smiling cordially as he opened the
door to admit fanshaw the eyelid which
drooped over fanshaws left eye quivered
slightly as he saw the three hats on the
rack but he said nothing as he followed the
chattering carroll into the study but at
sight of leverage and sullivan fanshaw
stood motionless a bit of color draining
from his cheeks in the most casual manner
in the world carroll introduced them to
fanshaw and hospitably begged his visitor
to be seated

  fanshaw perched gingerly on the edge of
a chair staring uncertainly at carroll and
the other two detectives a tenseness was
in the air which was reflected on the faces
of three of the four men only carroll
seemed unperturbed he was smiling
broadly boyishly he seemed thoroughly
happy-perfectly at ease he rose and
with hands in his pockets strolled about the
room saying nothing and thereby height-


all-story weekly

ening the uncomfortable atmosphere with
which the place was surcharged

  he strolled toward roger fanshaw he
came very close there was a leap- a
flash in the midday light-a double click
fanshaw was on his feet wrenching futilely
at the shining hand-cuffs which encircled
his wrists

  leverage was the first to speak  what
th hell he gasped

   carroll faced him and spoke quietly still
with the boyish smile playing about his
lips

   theres the man who killed joshua
quincy he announced gently

chapter xxiii

  the lie that looked like trfth

silence fell upon the group-silence
broken only by the stern ticking of the
ancient grandfathers clock in the cor-
ner silence broken by that and by the faint
roar of the city which came to them softly
subdued by the distance

  they were staring at fanshaw fanshaw
whose left eye was concealed beneath the
now closed lid fanshaw who was staring
dumbly at the shining hand-cuffs on his
wrists-trying to adjust himself to the sud-
den startling change in the aspect of things
he had left his boarding-house in an intoxi-
cation of jubilation-carrolls declaration
that he had his man had held out to him
the hope of perpetual safety

  and then-this

  a sextet of keen eyes were upon him
watching every play of color on his face
every quiver of the telltale lid of the left
eye every nervous spasmodic movement of
his big muscular hands-so helpless now in
their circlets of steel symbolizing the dread
grip of the inexorable law

  fanshaw stood quiet shaking his big
head-shaking his head and muttering dog-
gedly i didnt do it i didnt do it
gone was his wonted poise routed before
the onslaught of stark surprise surprise
and horror

    tell us about it chief begged lever-
age  because if this bird told you the
story you told me then its a marvel you

landed him it had me buffaloed right
how did you come to know that fanshaw
did it

     didnt said carroll simply  until i
was quite convinced that no one else could
have done it

   im intensely human and im afraid
a little gullible when fanshaw told me his
story i swallowed it hook line and sinker
it seemed perfectly all right to me  was as
unsuspicious as a new-born babe

   you see his psychology was sound as a
dollar it was perfectly natural that a man
in the position he claimed to have been
would be more frightened than if he had
really carried his plan through therefore i
did not question that phase of his story-
especially when it was corroborated by the
fact that-as  afterward proved-dorring-
ton really did see him in the garden

   youve heard of perfect crimes crimes
planned with a meticulous attention to de-
tail so that their perpetrator could not be
caught this was one-almost

   but fanshaw went the customary per-
fect crime one better-at the first indication
that something had gone wrong he came to
the detective whom he knew would in all
probability handle the case and put into his
hands-in a bunch-every bit of evidence
which could possibly incriminate him

   get the infernal cleverness of that i
knew that fanshaw had been there i knew
his motives and as the result of his extra-
ordinary story i went into my investigation
firmly convinced that fanshaw was in-
nocent

    after that no matter what evidence
against fanshaw i might uncover it was
discounted a hundred per cent in advance
he had disarmed me my suspicions were
killed before they were born

    and  admit frankly that his story
would have given him his liberty-would
have worked as he planned it to work-
had it not been for trifling flaws in its con-
sistency you see -carroll paused and
smiled slightly- he made the mistake of
telling me one outright lie and too much of
the truth

    he was especially clever in admitting to
me that quincy had in his possession a
check which he-fanshaw-had forged
the crimson alibi



he gave that as his motivating reason-as-
serting that quincy intended using that as
documentary evidence to send him to the
penitentiary his motive was ample

   but when i searched for that paper it
was not there at first  thought that fan-
shaw had taken it so i called on thaddeus
standish-quincys lawyer-and learned
that standish had the paper in his posses-
sion therefore knowing what i now
know i realized that after killing quincy
fanshaw carried out his original plan and
searched for that check

   he didnt find it and disarmed me fur-
ther by asserting that he hadnt even
hunted for it admitting his guilt of two
lesser crimes to conceal the greater

   i was prepared for minor discrepancies
in fanshaws story no man who had been
through what he had could be expected to
retail his yarn with a flawless fidelity to de-
tail but even at that-and i took the
trouble to interview him yesterday evening
about this point-he went too far when he
said several times that he had not entered
the room in which quincy was murdered

   if you remember the scene of the crime
you will recall that the chair is a high-
backed leather one facing the wall opposite
the door leading from the library-the door
through which fanshaw admits he entered
the study

   a person standing in that door could
not have seen the body more he could
not possibly have seen the knife even if the
body had been visible and there was no
doubt that fanshaw had seen the body
therefore it was simple to deduce the fact
that he had lied about not entering the
room

   that is item number one item num-
ber two has to do with the fact that the
shade was pulled down l is certain that
the shade to that single window was pulled
down by a man who wished to conceal what
he had done or was about to do preferably
-what he was about to do for if we pre-
sume that the murderer pulled the shade
down we must also admit that after the
commission of the murder the criminals one
thought would have been to make his get-
away

   but there again we run into fanshaws

story he went to that house prepared to
kill and then rob a man carrying through
that program would pull down the shade
first thing and ianshaw was the man who
pulled that shade down you will remem-
ber that he admitted that from his vantage
point behind the clump of lilacs near the
front gate he had watched the movements
of andrew quincy in the study he could
not have watched andrew had the shade
been down therefore it was up while fan-
shaw was in that yard before he entered the
house

   to clinch that matter let us consider
dorringtons story andrew left the house
-ianshaw tells that himself-and at that
time the shade was up fanshaw admits
that he entered shortly after andrew left
he entered through the library window
walked through the door to the study and
immediately pulled the shade down to con-
ceal his subsequent actions from the gaze of
passers-by it was after he had pulled the
shade down that dorrington returned to
make peace with joshua quincy

   flad dorrington gone immediately to
the house he would have caught andrew
but dorrington paused to wonder why that
shade was pulled down it was unusual
and speculating on it he heard a noise in
the rear of the house

   he went around to investigate he saw
larry conover and chased him he lost
conover and circled the house in time to see
ianshaw hiding under the bushes in front
all of these maneuvers of dorringtons took
quite a little time-and during that time
fanshaw had killed quincy and hurriedly
searched for the forged check

   this fact too you will notice auto-
matically frees dorrington of possible com-
plicity in the crime fanshaw himself ad-
mits that quincy was dead when he entered
the house and when fanshaw was in there
dorrington had not been in the house since
he had been discharged by joshua quincy
immediately after the dinner hour we
have the testimony of dorrington conover
and andrew to verify that

   now then-fanshaw told of seeing
andrew in the study with his uncle and of
seeing andrew leave but watching that
room as he was and with both of the doors


all-story weekly

leading into the study within plain view
from where he was hiding-fanshaw never
once mentioned seeing either conover or
dorrington in that room therefore on his
own story he exonerates both conover and
dorrington-constructively at any rate-
and narrows suspicion down to andrew

   andrew as we now know positively is
not guilty ellen told us at the time when
it incriminated her own husband--that she
saw joshua quincy follow andrew into the
hall as he was leaving and shake his fist at
him xot the reception-hall mind you but
the hall leading from the reception-hall to
the rear of quincys study therefore while
andrew was visible to fanshaw joshua
quincy was not and it is well established
that andrew did not reenter the house

   thus far the evidence in the case-put
together into a complete story now but
coming to us in distorted fragments-com-
pletely absolves dorrington and andrew
quincy the remaining suspect is conover

   now we have to consider two facts the
first is that fanshaw would have seen con-
over through the window the second is
that conover had he killed quincy-and i
confess that until i began piecing the evi-
dence together i thought he was guilty-
would have entered from the rear hall
stabbed his man and gone out by the same
door so that he would have been nowhere
near the shade and had the shade been
pulled down during the course of fanshaw
vigil in the garden he would have com-
mented on the fact

   but even that does not clear conover
not by a long shot a mere discrepancy-
thats all but you see it is a cumulation
of discrepancies in fanshaws story which
has at length convinced me

   three times  have examined the body
and you two men can of course plainly
remember the position of the knife before i
extracted it from the body you will recall
that it entered the body from the left side
having been plunged with an upward stroke
the blade found the heart

   gentlemen that blow was delivered by
a right-handed man fanshaw is right-
handed so is andrew so is dorrington
but larry conover is left-handed

   just an hour or so ago at the carter

hotel i puzzled you by asking him to write
for me and then to toss me the bit of paper
i had noticed that he used his left hand and
i wanted to establish fully that he was a
left-handed man

    i didnt keep silent about it then for
any love of theatric effect but merely be-
cause i was not ready at that time to tell
you about fanshaws story which had come
lo me in a semi-confidential way now that
 am convinced of his guilt-conditions
have changed i feel that i am justified in
using his own partial confession to piece out
a chain of convicting testimony

   conover being left-handed could not
have inflicted the blow that killed quincy
it would have been a physical impossibility
for him to have done so he would have
had to tie himself in a knot to thrust the
knife home from the left side of quincys
body provided the knife were held in his
left hand and that while not in itself suf-
ficient to clear conover-is certainly ample
in view of the other mitigating circumstan-
ces do you agree with me

  eric leverage nodded

   i hand it to you chief its a dandy
case-but-but-

   but what

theres one thing you overlooked

   which is

  leverage glanced uncertainly toward fan-
shaw who was sitting slumped down in his
chair still gazing at the handcuffs as if hyp-
notized

    shall i spill it before him

    certainly

   how do you know it wasnt suicide
fanshaws head jerked up with sudden
hope

   yes he croaked  how do you know
it wasnt suicide

   that answered carroll quietly  is
the missing link in the chain which i have
given you it is the thing which has puz-
zled me and yet i have had the evidence
from the very first although until a few
minutes ago i couldnt properly value it

   you see-my perspective was too close
circumstances and counter-circumstances
came hurtling at me in great gobs and con-
fused my view of the case as a whole it
has taken careful thought to put the puzzle
the crimson alibi



together and i havent had a chance for
really constructive thought until a few min-
utes ago i hope i may be excused for ap-
pearing a dullard in the matter im not
the transcendent sort of detective as ive
warned you more than once

  but as for the final link in the chain-
here it is 

  he walked to the mantel and took from
it the cigar humidor which he had brought
with him from quincys safe he unlocked
it and opened the top inside was the dag-
ger with which the crime had been com-
mitted

    even the veriest novice in these modern
times said carroll in a calmly conversa-
tional tone  looks for finger-prints when he
starts in on a case every detective knows
the value of finger-prints and every crook
knows their danger i was no exception to
the rule the handle of that knife is a won-
derful place for finger-prints-a beautiful
unengraved polished silver handle

    i looked for the finger-prints the minute
i saw the knife but my friends there is
something in this case far more damning
than the presence of finger-prints-and
that- he paused and gazed at them with
pardonable triumph- that gentlemen is
the fact that on the beautiful polished sil-
ver handle-there is not a single finger-
print

   what

    not one not a trace of a finger-print
had joshua quincy committed suicide the
prints of his fingers would have been
smeared all over the handle as a matter of
fact in nineteen cases out of twenty the
fingers of a man committing suicide in such
a manner would remain clutching the
handle

    as to dorrington andrew quincy and
larry conover-if any one of the three
killed quincy it was done in the heat of
passion and their finger-prints would have
been left all over the handle of this knife-
for any and all to read

    it is common to find finger-prints but
-consider this - the absence of finger-
prints in connection with a crime is proof
positive that there is a professional criminal
concerned in it

the

    it is also proof that the professional
 criminal planned his crime in advance and
 took the precaution to wear rubber gloves

    it is extremely unlikely that either
 joshua quincy his nephew dorrington or
 conover had the rubber gloves who then
 was here night before last who had a motive
 for killing joshua quincy and also was
 equipped with rubber gloves

    who had actually planned to commit
 the crimes of murder and robbery and
 what man planning such crimes would
 neglect to provide himself with so vital a
 thing as rubber gloves

   i am sure you will agree that there is
 only one answer it was not suicide and
 we have cleared andrew quincy larry
 conover and the butler dorrington it
 is simply a case of a perfect crime-made
 too perfect

    roger fanshaw is our man 

   carroll turned to fanshaw

    listen to me fanshaw he said kind-
 ly  i have a feeling of sympathy toward
 you which i know i shouldnt have but
 its there-perhaps because quincy was a
 rotter after all and because he worked you
 for years youre going to be punished for
 the crime and i believe that if you plead
 not guilty you will swing for it i dont
 want to see you hanged

    i cannot promise results but i will
 promise this if you will formally confess to
 the murder of joshua quincy i will do my
 level best to see that you get a sentence of
 life imprisonment instead of the rope how
 about it

   fanshaw raised a haggard face to carroll
 he moved his hands helplessly and the
 chains jangled

    i believe you will help me carroll he
 said in a slow tired voice  and i dont
 know that im sorry its all over if youll
 draw up the paper ill sign it

   as carroll rose to get pen and paper lev-
 erage buttonholed him

    say chief he whispered hoarsely
  let me be the first to tell larry conover
 and his wife will you i want to see the
 faces of them kids when they learn that
 theyre free

    go tell them eric said carroll

shaffles classed her as the real
article guaranteed fast colors the mo-
ment she entered the door there was
nothing individual about her dress seven-
a-vveek third floor back and bath privi-
leges was written all over the crepe de
chine shirtwaist and short black taffeta
skirt

  regardless of that in mr shaftless ex-
pert opinion queen victoria couldnt have
touched her walk with a fishing-pole more-
over when an unimpressionable check-room
employee swallows his gum upon receipt of
an imitation fox fur there is something
beyond doctors orders in the motive

  shaflles was not the only young man
aware that something unusual stood near
the ticket gate absorbed in the shifting
throng of dancers

    some clever little outfit id say regu-
lar wax-doll knock m dead three-speed
stepper you bet

  this from big olie stoll in a voice
pitched well above the dance music to an
admiring arc of satellites olies pianola
personality was almost as prominent around
linns as the orchestra if the three hun-
dred odd shop girls who danced there every
saturday night followed the habit for any
other reason than olie stoll it was a secret
to him  one of these days he often re-
marked  im gonna take up bowling and
theyll turn this place into a car-barn

   and id just like to lay good money
said olie slanting an appraisive eye toward
the ticket gate  that she can trip around
a trifle too i got a strong hunch to chance
her for the prize

   tought you an fritzi were teamin
for the cup put in one of the group
 want a mad lady on your hands

   take the siding slag im outnum-
bered couldnt please em all with as-
sistants now watch closely while i steer
alongside this birdie

  whereupon the incomparable olie gave
his orange scarf a deft fluff and crossed to
where the girl stood gently he tapped her
shoulder

   merry christmas girlie nearly missed
you in the crowd awful crush to-night
i guess this next scud is ours aint it
immediately the delicate almost imper-
ceptible manipulation of chewing gum
ceased a pair of large penciled eyes re-
garded the interlopers shoes in cold scru-
tiny lifted slowly past striped cuff and
specious tiepin and fixed on his cool grin

   say homely drawled the young lady
 whats the idea of punching people like
they was slot machines cant a goil drop
in here once in a while for a good time
without having to battle every janitor and
vulcanizer on the lot chase along and
comb your hair i aint running no danc-

shaffles picks a winner



  at such unpremeditated and pronounced
belligerency olie was prompted to retreat
but the eyes of his three friends were upon
him failure now meant an impaired repu-
tation

    stow that picnic wit he advised tak-
ing a familiar hold on one filmy sleeve and
moving toward the gate  you want to
dance with me all right we aint fully
acquainted thats all

   before the girl could reply or twist her-
self free olie bit out a groan reached
wildly for his ear and wilted to the floor
above him mr jimmy shaffles carefully
straightened a disarranged cuff and smiled
engagingly at the frightened little figure in
pink and black

   pardon me said he stepping over
olie who was giving a creditable imitation
of an arizona petrified tree and offering his
arm but i believe this is our dance

   a bit dazed the girl hesitated then she
saw people making hurriedly in their direc-
tion and understood together they passed
through the ticket gate and drifted off into
the maze of dancers

    gee mr willard cried the rescued
suddenly as shaffles skilfully circled an
awkward couple  if thanks were beer
checks youd control milwaukee  was
just planning to land on his headlight my-
self when you put over that sleeper some
shove all he needed was flowers and a
mahogany overcoat to complete the pic-
ture

  shaffles grinned modestly and bent his
energies to an intricate dip in which he was
followed unerringly by his partner

  youre new here arent you he
asked at length

   is that a slam at my footwork ex-
claimed the girl

  not at all i was only going to hint
that saturday nights at linns would be a
good habit for a kid like you not to get
this place isnt famous as a girls finishing
school i guess that little affair a minute
ago speaks for itself

    you mean right t know mr willard
replied the girl her facc dimpling with a
faint smile  but whats a frail going to
do evenings stand down on broadway
and wait for a parade to come along

  the young man considered a sound of
hand-clapping broke in on the crash of traps
and trombone

   arent there other places

   sure there is grand opera and the
palace tavern but them pale tea things
that coopay up to mrs forbes-lindsays
private auxiliaries aint troubled with weak
ankles and floorwalkers seven-fifty every
time the landlady hands out bath-towels
dont even spell movies not if you eat
regular of course now and then some wild
spender from the shoe department happens
around with tickets for central park and we
nearly collapse with the excitement linns
jazz band is a quiet nerve-cure after that
 its tough on you kids responded
shaffles earnestly sympathetic  darn
tough congress ought to take on a little
more help and look after these things
listen his voice lowered to an inspira-
tional whisper  i might as well introduce
myself jimmy shaffles of the empire
company not willard come to think
of it a million dollar trick like you ought
to get on easy we use rafts of extra girls
cant get enough decorating sofas in a
ball-room set beats checking sales at u
rummage counter steady work and human
wages besides how does it sound

   what is this empire company-a fur-
niture factory

   xo feature films  moving pictures
 gee cried the girl rapturously gee
whiz youre a star

   xot exactly shaffles hesitated and
colored painfully  office work but 
know cecil xeilan-chief stockholder and
head of the production department a word
from him goes you might even get a small
part at the start

  disappointment was so frankly indicated
on the girlis face that shaffl dove into a
gamut of popular steps to cover his con-
fusion immediately a storm of hand-
clapping set up sprinkled here and there
with piercing whistles

  then shaffles became aware of a spread-
ing void of waxed surface the great floor
was deserted save for two couples at the
farther end even as he looked a group of
men beneath the orchestra stand appeared
to consult hastily an arm gestured vio-

lently and one of the teams melted away
through an exit

  will you lamp the rink gasped the
girl

   shafiles nodded

   slipped me entirely he said  its
the prize dance now hold tight and well
hand this crowd the one complete treat of
their lives hear that noise weve got
the cup in a walk

  they were drifting close to the brass
railing spinning gliding whirling dip-
ping they skirted the solid hedge of ap-
proving faces suddenly the trim little
figure flashing along with shaffles faltered
in the midst of a dizzy pivot and crumpled
in his arms before that amazed young
man could come to a full enjoyment of the
situation spectators ducked under the rail-
ing from every corner some one bawled
repeatedly a little air you guys and
shaffles found himself feeding the girl ice
water in one of the confectionery stalls ar-
ranged for patrons just off the floor

   open your mouth a little he said
gently  thats nice drink it all

  the girl sighed and stared long at him
over the tilted glass

   mr-shaffles

    you said it

   i guess i crabbed the show all right
   dont let that worry you

   but honest my head-just went out
sometimes at the store i get a little loppy
the same way

  shaffles whose discernment had led him
to certain significant conclusions was
prompted to reply  i shouldnt doubt
that but refrained and looked at his
watch

   its getting along towards closing-
time he announced  suppose we pull
out

  they paused at the tall green draperies
at the entrance somewhat uncertainly the
girl dug in a bag at her wrist and tendered
her claim check

   you can go get my things mr
shaffles she said but i forgot to ex-
plain that guys never see me home thats
one of my rules

   why not

   my landlady put up a squeal the last

gent i couldnt shake walked off with four
milk botdes and a pet chinese porch plant
the old girl had been digging around since
the spanish war it was either promise or
find another suite

   shaffles grinned

   well miss nobody spoke for an escort
job i dont want your old doormats sec-
ond-story work for me every time my
place is to see that to-night you eat

  the girl reddened to her eves  why-
i eat

   sure so do birds nevertheless were
going to run through every chuck shop in
this village to-night from the blue grotto
to rileys cellar its all arranged

   youre a genuine full-carat kid fal-
tered the girl l i can see that but-

   hold on i know the rest-you havent
known me long enough were almost
strangers thats certain but i dont pro-
pose to let anything short of an earthquake
break up this little excursion just wait
here and ill rustle the millinery shaffles
precluded further discussion by diving off
for the check-room

  when he returned the girl had gone
wildly he banged through the glass doors
and slid across the tiled lobby

  a beautiful black car with red wire
wheels was just pulling away from the
curb through the window of the closed
tonneau shaffles caught a flashing glimpse
of his pretty friend beside her was a
large bulky man in a top hat

   some rich old duck muttered shaffles
bitterly watching the green light of the
motor fade up the street  some dried-up
capsule with three casters gone lots of
cash and rheumatism no liabilities and
hair autos servants flowers theaters
wine dinners diamonds-money what the
little yellow bills wont buy isnt worth
having even at that-

  now there are moments when a man
courts battle very readily as shaffles
turned crumpling a white fur fiercely in
one hand his line of vision came within
direct contact with four young men stand-
ing away from the glare of the lobby who
seemed covertly interested in his move-
ments it was the orange tie and damaged
ear that stamped relief and pleasure on
shaffles picks a winner



shaffless face flere was solace not to be
found in bottles and hypodermics he
sauntered over to the group

   were you gentlemen waiting for me
he inquired in the same sweet tone a wife
employs when soliciting a new hat

  some minutes later a squad of police
shouldered through the mob that blocked
the sidewalk in front of linns at the
same time a badly battered figure ducked
unnoticed from the throng scurried head-
long into a side street stumbled over a fire
plug and landed panting on the cushions of
a handsome red roadster with black wire
wheels

   some old relic mused the fugitive as
he released the clutch and the car shot
away  some feeble keepsake with young
ideas

  at about three oclock one warm after-
noon a girl leaving the entrance of a de-
partment store on broadway collided with
a young man going in he nodded politely
to her apology and continued on his way
she darted through the door and touched
his arm

   wont you speak to me mr shaffles

   it didnt strike me as necessary he
replied wearily

   i suppose youre mad because i chased
off and left you the other night

   oh no certainly not

   i think you are

   lets not talk about it

   im awful sorry  had to go honest
and you didnt show up at linns after
that so that i could explain

  i didnt mind your leaving

   then youll forgive me mr shaffles

   it was the way you went most work-
ing girls when they want to be real nice
dont run around with fuzzy dyspeptics in
twin-six sedans

  the girl caught her breath

   do they pressed shaffles heartlessly
she remained silent a little handkerchief
held to her mouth

   i asked-do they-

   no mr shaffles  guess not but
you see that old hand-me-down is the su-
perintendent and-

  what superintendent

   staceys - where i sold hairpins and
mucilage up to last week

  shaffles gazed at the girl a moment the
chill gone from his eyes

   ill bet you had to kid that old chromo
along to keep your job he exclaimed
hopefully  ill bet he wouldnt leave you
alone

   of course youre on now boiled
rice wages and lots of invitations to supper
thats what girls get at staceys i had
been standing him off for a month before
i met you that same night he lounged
around the counter with another sherry and
music bid i told him the girls were having
a big time at linns and that i was going
 guess i must have bumped him on the
same stall before he got kind of red
under his whiskers and said he wouldnt
mind calling for me i couldnt think of
anything to say just then and thats what
he did

  she paused and shaffles shifted the pack-
age he held under his arm

   after he blew me to a shrimp and
broiler layout that would have given mr
hoover jumping willies  began to feel
brave out on the sidewalk i told him
what a mean little pill he was and hit the
cement for home

   good-by job suggested shaffles

   good-by job assented the girl

  a rush of shopping traffic pushed through
the entrance shaffles leaned closer to the
girl

   i said something while we were dancing
about work at the studio remember

   i didnt forget it for a minute-but i
thought you were kidding me

   i w-asnt assured shaffles  and
there is a better chance for you to get on
now than before one of our new directors
is just starting a shopgirl comedy-drama
department store interiors and that sort of
stuff hes wild about types he wants
the real article  could meet you on the
lot to-morrow and steer the introduction
if he is particularly tickled it means a

  shaffles fumbled in a pocket and handed
her a card

   meet me on the stage promptly at nine
oclock

    ill be there with bells she said smil-
ing and holding out her hand  good-by
mr shaffles-and thanks very much for
your trouble

  the-girl threaded intothe push outside
and hurried homeward on a clattering
street corner shaffles overtook her

   i wanted to let you know he said
hesitantly  that the dont-seem-to-place-
you stunt i pulled a minute ago was all fool
-stage stuff ive been hunting through
the department stores for a week trying to
find you and return your fur he man-
aged a confused grin and held out the
bundle he had been carrying  if you
hadnt followed me i would have done the
chasing myself

  when shaffles catapulted into the studio
office of cecil neilan early the next morning
like an impetuous french    he inter-
rupted the famous producer in a self-in-
dulgent soliloquy entirely foreign to his no-
toriously modest character

   i guess im not good mused mr
neilan smiling suavely around a big cigar
and winking delightedly at an imaginary
audience

    i beg your pardon put in shaffles

    i guess im-great grievous cat tracks
sit down jimmy regular stranger how
did the type quest pan out expected you
last week got the  sentimental sally 
support lined up complete tullv foreman

we must start work by the first that
goes jimmy

hat and ebony walking stick on neilans
desk and carefully jack-knifed into a chair

   you can trot out the  wizard  and his
little camcra and begin shooting scenes to-
morrow he announced  to-day if you
like ive found the girl to play sally
the genuine article cecil the real pedi-
greed goods

   then youre serious about that ab-
origine stuff you wont consider gabrielle
roberts

   i wouldnt consider the cleverest star
on broadway in place of this kid not for
a minute shaffles leaned forward and
tapped the desk  gabrielle roberts with
all her new york prestige couldnt hold an
inch of tallow to what this little chicle-
chewing rag-time doll will do that is in
this particular character shes the shop
gamin from hairpins to high heels as
sally shell show up like general pershing
in a berlin beer garden

   have it your way sighed neilan re-
signedly  our contract places the choosing
of the star with you i rely on your judg-
ment-although god knows why an author
should claim any

  you wait warned shaffles you
wait and see shell be here in half an
hour im to meet her on the stage why
cecil in the first place as the most incon-
sequent mind you of innumerable assets
shes the prettiest-

  some one was knocking at the door

   come right in invited neilan he
put down his cigar and got to his feet
shaffles stood up also only to resume his
seat with the precipitate plunge of a depth
bomb

  it was she

  it was the little blond lady of linns
only the black taffeta skirt was gone the
cheap pink shirtwaist was gone and the
restless churning movement of cheek and
molar-that had vanished too instead
there was gold velvet heavy black fur
rings poise perfume

   mr shaffles said neilan with some-
what elaborate ceremony  i would like
you to meet miss roberts

  shaffles found his feet grabbing at the
extended slim hand a battery of dancing
dimples was trained full upon him

   im glad to please you he blurted
i mean-im pleased to-cecil

  cecil was grinning placidly

   not-not gabrielle 

  even so jimmy

weve been crooked to me its terrible to
think of the way we have exploited tender
youth and credulity overwhelming why

ploded shaffles he glanced at miss rob-
erts there was mischievous mirth in her
eyes

    but after allrambledneilan in a tone-
less voice  you were a stubborn rascal
you didnt realize the impracticability of
picking a girl without the least stage ex-
perience fair a fit as she might have been
behind a dress goods counter or wearing the
hardwood in a cheap dance hall to play the
lead in a big empire production before
the camera she would lose those winning
traits of environment her acting would be
about as natural and ingenuous as artificial
flowers your little shoplady heroine is a
difficult part miss roberts broke into
belascos payroll through her clever inter-
pretation of similar roles i wanted her to
play sally

    i believe we went over that before re-
minded shaffles uneasily

   we did and  agreed to that star-
selecting clause you had a rattling fine
play too good to pass up you see i
counted on disillusioning you of your type
bug but when you refused flatly to con-
sider the best little character actress in the
country i went ahead and got crooked i
wired miss roberts in new york to come
ahead we found out your haunts one
night we drove over to linns and she met
you there the broad pleased grin had
spread again over neilans face and he
nodded toward the actress the real
article jimmy the gen-uine pedigreed
goods

  shaffles had a sense of humor he
laughed until neilan grew apprehensive and
ducked from the office-presumably in
search of the studio surgeon

   bui the missing milk bottles pon

dered shaffles when he and the girl were
alone  the fainting that wealthy old
weasel at staceys-

    just stage stuff she replied smiling
winsomely  little white prevarications
 had to have a setting of some importance
you know

   shaffles pondered again

   youll make a wonderful sally he
ventured

    then you still wish me to take the part

-	after such duplicity

    after such a convincing rehearsal you
mean of course i want you why no
one in this world or the next could even
chew gum as cleverly as you did that night
at linns either you star in this piece
or it never goes on tll chuck it in an ash
can first

    id love the part said miss roberts
simply

   an insidious silence crept into the office
and enveloped the two shaffles became
absorbed in the reflection of the window
light on miss robertss hair it was bright
gold and curly that he remembered was
exactly what his script specified for sally
- rather small figure eyes big and ex-
pressive hair bright gold and curly

    mr-shaffles miss roberts was say-
ing hesitantly  do you remember shaking
hands with me when i came in

    why yes of course

    well-would you--did you know that
you have been holding my hand ever
since

  shaffles started then a determined
gleam struck his eye why not take a
chance it would be a little premature
perhaps and the papers said she received
a hundred mash notes a day-said she had
refused english coronets and half of pitts-
burghs steel fortunes-said she was the
most talented young - but why consider
that there was no grass growing under
his own feet at times the papers talked
about him too he leaned toward her in
an affectionate manner

   tell me gabrielle-your hand-is it
tired

    why yes she replied softly avoiding
his eyes that one is-but you know-
jimmy-i have two of them
pkilip m fisker jr

      ty young friend said the profes-
l sor condescendingly have you
  a indulged in introspective coagita-
tion as it were

   huh said i

  the professors benign smile intensified
his condescension

   ah you do not understand i thought
you would not he replied  but to sim-
plify have you not at odd moments felt
and at once fulfilled a certain odd desire to
enter into positive ratiocinative argument
with the negatives of your true inward self
ah ah-as it were

  i picked up a heavy walnut cribbage-
board from the table examined it with
great interest and even thoughtfully
weighed it in my hand i made no other
answer professor eisenkopfs apprehen-
sive eye at once contradicted the benignance
of his lips professor eisenkopf as is read-
ily seen was at least in this definite and
practical way and in spite of his conceit at
once a mind reader and logician

  his frame stiffened my heart melted

   do you mean i asked gently setting
down the board as i sat upon the edge of
the heavy library table  do you mean-
have i ever taken the trouble to worry
about my real secret self to wonder where
it is and what it might be

  professor eisenkopfs eyes sparkled and
his frame was transmuted from its oaken
stiffness of alarm back to the relief of plaint
aspen he rubbed his hands happily-and
bowed with renewed graciousness

   exactly mr hemmingway exactly

 to myself i chuckled to the lean pro-
 fessor i said abruptly

  thanks i have not

 his eyes showed positive horror

  what you never-

  never i nodded

 his eves widened with growing pity

 you-you-

  i have never had the time i explained
 to soothe his wounded soul the study of
 the  inner self  was his hobby and i knew
 it but i think i must have been born  or-
 nery and here i saw a chance to tease the
 professor and have a litle fun

  the time cried the professor raising
 his hands reproachfully

  perhaps i had better say i added
 cruelly again  the opportunity

 the professor sank into a chair

  the-

  dont take it so hard sir i may be
 wrong in both these statements after all
 it might simplv be that i lack the ah-
 the-

 yes ye yes cried my companion
 earnestly and with renewed enthusiasm

  the inclination sir i murmured
 weakly

  my god  the professor fairly sobbed
 my god he blurted out once more
 then and you call yourself a modern
 man even ultramodern professor eisen-
 kopfs voice rose high

 i nodded proudly and answered gallant-
 ly but with a certain self-effacing weakness
 which i knew would take

  your statement sir i said  is cor-
his inner self



 red in toto and your perception of my
 own inward character is wonderful wonder-
 ful what need then i added with mali-
 cious show of interest- what need of my
 tearing out my inner self and its secrets and
 subjecting them to my own personal exami-
 nation and to perhaps necessary mental cas-
 tigation when you so ably do the former
 for me

  the dear professor rose nobly to my bait
 i will help you-will start you at once
mr flemmingway i have always observed
that you were a true man of my heart-did
i not leave my studies to come up to-night
simply to see you and talk with you on
questions of the day all this time i might
have been working on my experiments-and
yet i came to you-to you and so i will
help you to seek your true inward self all
mr hemmingway your inner self-what a
field for exploration-and even exploitation
and development your inner self your se-
cret self your true self your-

    myself self to put it simply sir

  the professors hand switched at his
smooth-pointed goatee

   exactly mr hemmingway exactly

    and this self self  hinted breathless-
ly giving visual evidence of a great thirst
for knowledge as well

  your true inner consciousness he
cried enthusiastically  that part of you
that prompts you to do things which yoi
are prevented by your artificially developed
reason from really carrying out the part
that would act on whim desire impulse
the part of yourself that would control
your every act or at least would like to so
control if your reasoning and cultivated
mind did not exercise its calming power and
prevent

   you mean-if i suddenly thirst for an
egg-chocolate-malted-milk just horribly
and suffer for it real pain and am just
about to call for one when reason says

	you have just finished your fourth good
friend remember no matter how you
thirst it was the last drop that burst the
camels tummy forbear for your own
stomachs sake beware the tides of-
well thats about it isnt it sir

   exactly mr flemmingway exactly

    well i said  begin

  professor eisenkopfs jaw dropped

   begin

    precisely sir i replied eagerly

   but what shall i begin he cried

   to set me in the right track professor
to guide me in the tortuous paths of intro-
spection lest i fall by the wayside and die
in the muck of my own imagination

  the professors hands clasped in his ex-
citement then he calmed suddenly and
gazed intently at me without a sign of emo-
tion stared until i almost squirmed beneath
his scrutiny then as suddenly again he
smiled and nodded vigorously

   a man of my own heart-how ably ex-
pressed mr hemmingway  now he
settled himself comfortably in my heavy
leathered chair  to begin my first re-
quirement is this-ah the professor
paused and gazed in abstraction at the ceil-
ing

   well i hinted after a moment

   exactly he cried fixing his eyes upon
mine  your mind must be opened abso-
lutely in answering whatever questions i
ask you must be absolutely frank that is
my first condition

  my face  hope remained sober i re-
marked without hesitation that i would fol-
low his directions i would be frank-very
frank

  the second requirement i asked
gently

   my second requirement said the pro-
fessor  is this you must take a sheet of
ordinary letter paper and write upon it
some secret you have always entertained
let it be something as nearly unbiased by
propriety or custom or reason as possible
let it be simply a frank and open-minded
statement of the tiling as you see it let it
be an expression as near as you can make
it of your true inner self

  i nodded-and found the paper

   i will go into the next room i said
 for privacy and for greater secrecy in or-
der to make this examination a real test i
added  i am very desirous i assure you
professor eisenkopf of really knowing what
my inner mind is

  i stayed in the other room several min-
utes and thought then i went back and
held out the folded paper already sealed in


all-story weekly

its envelope professor eisenkopf waved
it aside

   place the envelope under yonder crib-
bage case he directed  i will not touch
it yet but i will endeavor by bringing
out your true thoughts which represent
your true inner self unhampered by reason
to lead those thoughts in such a way as to
finally come to the very one which is writ-
ten upon that paper  will show you by-
analyzing your many minor thoughts how
one may by simple process of reasoning ar-
rive at the one great absorbing thought
which is the all-inclusive expression of your
true inward self do you follow me

  he bent his hawkish features upon me as
i drew up another cushioned chair before
the fire i took the time to inhale a first
comforting breath of the long havana be-
tween my teeth  start right in profes-
sor i said to myself  youll think long
before you discover what is on that paper
 so far the way is clear sir  an-
swered aloud  you will question me re-
garding my inner self i will answer as best
i can very frankly and with no evasion of
the issue and in the end by a process of
reasoning you will discover for me the one
real absorbing thought that is my true inner
self you will name what is on the paper
there-the true expression of my real self
 exactly sir exactly the professors
black eyes snapped  first now-what is
the thought that is uppermost in your mind
at this very instant

   i must be frank i reminded him

  he nodded gravely  as to your phy-
sician sir

   at my ranch i answered slowly and
exhaled a thin stream of blue tobacco smoke
--i at my ranch is a sick cow

  professor eisenkopfs delicate brows rose
a trifle i fancied at the matter of factness
of my answer then as if a thought had
struck him as already certain and as if my
answer had been in accord with it he
nodded

   li-all lie murmured  at your
ranch there is a sick cow

  his voice was wondrous now and
dreamy poor professor-hed discover my
true inner self oh yes that papef-

   deduction number one correct  ap-

proved as i flicked my ash upon die hearth
then after a moments frowning silence on
my companions part  next

   and er-er-the cows name

   euphrosonie i promptly answered
the professors brows knitted once more
once more he thought in silence then once
more he murmured

   euphrosonie

   deduction number two correct i de-
clared  fine fine-remarkable and fol-
lowing that i am afraid i almost was
rude almost gave myself away but with-
out a word the professor sank back in
thought

  and while he thinks-let us for a mo-
ment philosophize

  reason is a queer thing a queerer thing
still is reasoning and when one reasons
falsely the superlative of queerness may be
reached-and the deduction though arrived
at by a process of reasoning and though it
seemed reasonable enough yet it is not
within reason and when one reasons
rightly the deduction will be correct and
within reason and yet queerly enough may
at the same time as we think the matter
over be unreasonable

  thus in following false logic one may
find himself reasonable but wrong and in
following correct logic one may find himself
unreasonable but right therefore the rea-
sonable is not always right nor is the unrea-
sonable always wrong yet we hear a
thing must be either right or wrong then
does it not follow-or does it-that the rea-
sonable may sometimes be the unreason-
able

   after this brief mental hiatus the curtain
rises in haste

  the professor has been thinking the
professor wishes to lead us to that all-
absorbing thought which is my inner self
he is trying to lead to the paper in that
sealed envelope under that book on my
library table wherein is-but we will see if
he scents the reasonable trail or not

   you have a ranch then i take it

    correct in first detail  replied  but
as to the second-you dont

  he stared at me thoughtfully a moment
then frowned in grim reproval

    it is a dairy ranch
his inner self



   its in the middle of the sunny san
joaquin i answered  and i have no ir-
rigation plant

   then this-this-what did you say the
name was

   euphrosonie i repeated

   ah-then this euphrosonie is the only
cow you have only a family cow as it
were

   correct again i nodded then added
 as it is

   and she is kept for her milk the pro-
fessor went on raising his fine brows once
more

   only on the side i answered  her
real purpose is architectural ah i went
on  in the delicious san joaquin twilight
with the sun a golden orange flattening fast
beneath the western valley haze and the
coolness of the river breezes sweeping up
from the bays below and the stars peeping
out in the deepening blue overhead and a
glowing glory reflected over all from the
tinted snows of the far-off sierras ah tis
then that euphrosonie does her part eu-
phrosonie adds tone to the lovely scene-as
well as milk ah professor it is wonderful
what that cow can do why she-

  professor eisenkopfs hand stopped my
flow

   thank heaven he said  that all
poets are not yet driven from this earth
then he paused

  i started the professor was really a
pretty good chap after all and this despite
his theories i reached out and humbly
touched his kness

   thank you i murmured but he
heard not-his mind was working toward
that hidden paper and the expression upon
it that would show my inner self

   good he went on  things progress
admirably you own a ranch-therefore
you love the out of doors the fact that
you keep a cow shows a tendency toward
domesticity and a longing for home and
family life that you say you keep her for
her beauty as well as her milk combined
with your so wonderfully expressed appreci-
ation of the san joaquins evening wonders
leads me to the conclusion that you are at
heart an artist

   an uncle of mine i muttered

 painted my windmill and my r f d

box

  the professor ignored my frantic boast

   and that you do not live upon the
ranch he went on  shows a love of ease
and luxury good-but eu-euphrosonie
is ill you say

  i nodded i had said that the cow was
indisposed certainly but how was this rea-
scffiing going to lead to the discovering of
my real inner self

   and that thought was uppermost in
your mind when i asked you my first ques-
tion is that not correct continued pro-
fessor eisenkopf  you were thinking of
that suffering animal far up in the san jo-
aquin-and held that thought above all
other thoughts is she very ill

   quite i answered sadly

   and is her pain great

   no sooner had i left the ranch last
week-end than her moans mingled with the
chirping music of the crickets in the stub-
ble i murmured

   ah-it is sad it is sad and you are
worried

  i nodded again-dumbly

  professor eisenkopf eyed me gravely a
moment and with his elbows on the arms
of the chair thoughtfully tapped his fingers
together

   and to-day is thursday-four days
have passed since you saw her last and yet
still the impression made by her pain is up-
permost in your mind my deduction from
this is obvious mr hemmingway you are
not only a lover of the great outdoors an
artist but also a man of sympathy

  i gravely exhaled a whirling flood of good
havana smoke

   obviously i repeated then lower
 the darn she-cattle cost me sixty-five
bucks

   and yet continued the professor his
black eyes searching mine  and yet with
all this trouble and anxiety and tempera-
ment you can sit here calmly and do your
best to aid me in teaching you how to look
into your true inner self it is wonderful-
and i am almost arrived at my goal in but
one moment more i will name that inmost
thought that is yourself-and you will un-
derstand and see at last and to think-


all-story weekly

the mention of this simple cow has brought
me to my conclusion the science of logical
reasoning is indeed wonderful wonderful
 nodded maybe it was but i doubted
it the professors reasoning was reasonable
enough-that i had to admit but then he
might be like the chicken thief who was
very careful and quiet as he entered the
roost shed and very cautious as he felt of
the chickens as they cluck-clucked in their
dreams and entirely reasonable in seizing
one which displayed a singular sleekness to
the touch but wrong in conclusion-for
the thing he seized was a fat-fed pole cat
bent upon an errand similar to his and
the professors conclusion might be just as
er-ah-bad

  the professor was very very calm now
 could see that what he had said was true-
he was approaching the climax of his logic
he would soon tell me what was on that
sheet of paper he would divulge to me my
true inner self

  i was learning rapidly-wonderfully
my true inner self the secret would be
out inwardly i helped myself to a hearty
and i must say a conceited chuckle  the
higher we soar i reminded the professor
in the depths of my silent thought  the
harder the fall poor professor but then
i was here to learn

  the professors eyes seeming all pupil
fixed themselves upon mine-and my in-
ward chuckle then threatened again to break
out but i restrained myself-and won-
dered to what conclusion professor eisen-
kopf would arrive quite suddenly he
leaned forward and tapped upon my knee
i leaned for the shock-my inner self-and
steadied my features to sphinxlike gravity

  i have it he cried enthusiastically
i i have it listen the thought that was
uppermost in your mind of this unfortu-
nate euphrosonie this cow has given it to
us listen

  i looked into his eye-and then i lis-
tened what was this the professor was
saying what-was his reasoning so truly
logical had he come really to a reason-
able conclusion was- and would the
paper in that envelope prove-

   listen you he cried

   you bought a ranch not a farm-but

to boast about you are too lazy to run it
yourself-so found a man whod take the
trouble you bought a cow because the
ma you hired to run the ranch out of debt
for you has a growing family and for that
reason only your cow is ill if she is ill at
all because you cut her rations and raised
cain about her feed when you so honored
your ranch with a visit this last week-end

   you have no poetry in your heart be-
cause in place of a heart you have a throb-
bing lump of rotten and iconoclastic cyni-
cism you made a mock of something i
would do to really draw you from your self-
dug pit of miring conceit and asininity-
and scoffed at my earnestness in my very
face and  your guest at your very
hearth

   the professor rose his eyes flashing

    and your entire self is so absorbed in
your entire self in your own complete self-
ishness and conceit that your inner self
your true self rasps through as raggedly
and as raucously as a broken tooth-saw
through a knot-holed timber you are an
egotistical nonentity a know-nothing-and
you know it not and my conclusion easily
arrived at t assure you sir is that your
true inner self is an absolute blank

   jumped for the envelope wherein lay
the folded paper but he beat me to it
he raised the cribbage board and seized
the envelope  sank down into my chair
and covered my eyes with my hands and
groaned

  the professor was very very silent after
i heard himustle that paper open then
suddenly he burst into a peal of ironic and
sneering laughter-and i trembled in my
shame and exposure

  the professor was right-and my own
act had proved it for the paper itself was
absolutely blank

  dimly  heard the professor move toward
the hall quickly  jumped to my feet and
took him by the arm and lead him back
and held out my prime havanas and siz-
zled something in a glass

   sit down  pleaded  i want to learn
-to learn how to make something out of
nothing

  and heaven be praised the professor
was the man that  was not -and sat
 romance clings to the very names of some parts of this big wonderful world
 of ours high up in the list of these blessed places is the spanish main still
 sailed by the shades of treasure ships and the craft of the buccaneers and
 pirates who preyed upon them still haunted by the ghosts of bloody-handed adven-
 turers who stands grim guard over many an ill-gotten and still unfound treasure of
 gold and silver and precious stones

      yet all the romance is not of the past mysterious schooners still sail on errands
 that will not bear the light of day blood runs hot in the veins of the people who
 inhabit the islands in these seas of high adventure-people of a dozen races and with
 the passions of the four quarters of the earth along the white beaches love and hate
 and death are swift and sudden darkness follows swift upon the heels of brilliant
 sunlight the velvet blackness of the starlit night is rent by the jagged gleam of light-
 sail graceful palms wave over peaceful coral strands which are the scenes of violent
 crime-the stage is always set for romance for love for tragedy and upon this stage
 steps-janie frete

      what reader of the all-story weekly doesnt love that little lady of many ad-
 ventures and many charms janie of the brave heart and quick wit janie the shrewd
 the daring the demure the reckless the knowing the lovable our readers know that
 a janie frete story is a good story her name raises high expectations-and they are
 all fulfilled in the four-part serial which starts in next weeks issue-

a shortage in perfumes

by raymond s spears
author of janie frete intruder the green sachem trail of the otter pelts etc

      one of janies many friends among those knights of the open road known to an
 unsympathetic world as  tropical tramps found a treasure not of gold or silver or
 gems to be sure but yet a real treasure sealed it in an iron cask and buried it on an
 uninhabited island intending of course to return for it but he didnt-death
 claimed him so he left the treasure to janie but when she heard of it it was through
 captain taulk expert and widely traveled parjumeur who had decided that he was
 the man who really needed the contents of that buried cask

      you know janie frete well enough to be sure that captain taulk had a lot of
 excitement coming to him when he started to defraud her of what was rightfully hers

      its a fast-moving colorful tale with characters who are real flesh-and-blood men
 and women-a drama staged on the worlds most romantic stage and worthy of its
 setting and one of the characters-sorilla of the turtle fleet-is worthy to take rank
 with the charming janie frete herself

 

when the stripped and bleeding victim of her bosom wide to ease his tired heart and guides

medicine for the ills to which flesh is heir from
the bruised heel of a little boy to the battered

   and swifter still to ply her healing touch for
 those who have won to an understanding of her
 moods and temper is the sea for unless a man
 is willing to partake of the sacrament of the sea
 she casts him forth as unclean and unfit for the

   our novelette for next week-

fi-fam lag

by burke jenkins

 is a story of the sea and a very entrancing story
 you will find it for here are ranged no ordinary
 seamen but men who upon the watery plain
 played for the highest stakes knowing full well
 their jealous mistress would impartially apportion
 the victory if you appreciate primitive passion
 great simplicity and an artfully told story watch
 for the docking of u ship from yillikao

	t	

   the title of max brands incisive little tale in
 next weeks all-stohv weekly- victory 
 -might lead some suspicious soul into thinking
 here is another war story nothing of the kind
 wise reader guess again brands hero left no
 record of his war impressions and opinions but it
 is a safe bet his heart was in the right place
 he never came within speaking distance of any-
 thing so concretely real as victory in the current
 meaning of the term but after all is no victory
 in any sense as much a matter of intention as
 achievement in casting up the account of j
 augustus vicars he would be a daring man indeed
 who would seek to strike the balance

   if the elegiac inspiration of one of the most
 eminent of the victorian poets could be trusted
 tears are a nobler gift than laughter but the
 spontaneous conviction of the whole american
 people cries out against this tragic judgment
 humor the most potent panacea for human in-
 firmity from penury lo peevishness is the most
 precious gift of the gods love alone has a
 longer line of clients and love is just a little un-
 comfortable not to say heroic unless sweetened
 with a soupcon of humor in proof and verifica-
 tion of the above platitudes we have only to refer
 you to one of the best samuel g camp stories
 we have ever published it is called trkat
 em rough and will be found in next weeks
 magazine

  

   few of us who work for the  other fellow 
but feel at limes the ways of promotion an- pas

nnding out the system is incomprehensible ex-
cept lo those who pull the strings if like our-
selves you have exhausted the correspondence
school short road to success or gone on the rocks
with the plausible promoter of latent talent who
improves your memory or sells you the great
trade or professional sccret at so many dollars
down and the rest in weekly instalments you
will be particularly interested in h p holts

vividly narrates the desperate chance one man

   crime and criminals lie all about us thick as
 leaves in vallambrosa but the average son of
 democracy who pays his taxes votes conscien-
 tiously and goes lo church regularly on certain
 stated occasions is somewhat at a loss to under-
 stand the depths of municipal depravity which
 arc periodically exposed when the two dominant
 political parties change places of victor and van-
 quished from which you would naturally infer
 when we go on to speak of frank blightons
 story  ace in the hole that this tale of
 mystery and crime was primarily concerned with
 political issues nothing of the kind read the

 have your reward

to the editor 

  i have been a constant reader of the all-story
weekly for several years and i think it is a
splendid magazine wc get the magazine from
the news-stand every week and after reading it
send it on to my soldier brother in france he en-
joys your magazine greatly and used to buy it
himself before enlisting  think all your stories are
fine but i especially enjoyed  koyala the beauti-
ful  white tigers  everymans land  the
texan and all of e k meanss stories by the
way why dont we ever have some more of his
stories i think they are so amusing and true to
life i see in this weeks all-story weekly
edgar rice burroughss name on the  honor
roll i had been wondering why we never had
any more of his wonderful stories my brother
and i both agree that his stories of tartan are
without an equal i am very fond of reading
but while school keeps i dont have very much
time as i am in high school all day and at night

to the editor

  enclosed you will find a post-office order for
two dollars for six months subscription for the
all-story weekly i have been a reader of it
since long before you changed the name from the
cavalier and i want you to start the magazine
with the date of november  then november
 and december  as i have missed these three

i think it the best and most interesting of all the
magazines i have read  have been getting them
in omaha but they come so irregular that i
thought best to get them from you  am an old
lady of seventy-two and have read the all-
story weekly for years some stories are cer-
tainly good for the blues in others i find
laughter and tears i hope and pray in the long
years to come you will keep the all-story
weekly in view for i want to enjoy it as i ever
have done through the years be they many or
few hoping to get the books soon i am

to the editor

  i have just finished reading miss mildred
thomass letter about mr l b bladess story

 claire i also wish to congratulate you on
securing so fine an author and hope we will hear
from him soon again it was splendid and i
think it taught some of us a lesson to think
before we speak  to people who arc less fortu-
nate than us who arc physically sound

  i have just finished  lady of the night
wind and enjoyed it as i do all stories by mr
v yanardy i like the western stories and those
of the north had a good sword story like
black wolf of picardy the argosy one
question id like to ask you to answer when you
have time-who was the author of the swami
ram stories and will we hear from him again in
the same would like to hear from g ogden
j b hendryx e k means e j rath and h
titus we have not heard from those just men-
tioned in a very long time by  we  i mean the
all-story weekly fans i read all your short
stories and find them all dandy so keep up the
good work with best wishes to you mr
editor and all your authors for a very merry
chrislmas and a happy new year

  just received yours of the nd informing me
you were unable to supply me the all-story
weekly of september  gentlemen have a
heart do you realize you are denying me a
complete novel by gregory besides generous in-
stalments of ilendryx franklin and the william-
sons again i say have a heart will you be
kind enough to publish this in heart to heart
talks and maybe some of the readers will be
willing to exchange a september s issue of the
all-story weekly for a perfectly good quarter

vember   and have not missed a single
copy since i have all the numbers on file and
when i get a complete story i start and read it
without waiting for the copies to come each week
i think the promise by james b hendryx


all - story weekly

was an exira good story also i am always
especially interested in the writing of e k
means burroughs jackson gregory isabel os-
trander and in fact nearly all of the stories in
your magazine it is the best magazine published
to-day and the other magazines arc not interest-
ing after reading the all-story weekly i have
every number of the au-story weekly since
november   to january   all packed
complete and in rotation and as i have read them
all i would sell them to any one that would
make me an offer for the two years and over of
the back numbers who wants them what
offer do you make in cash and transportation

that deserves these copies and making the offer
that they would be willing to pay thanking you
in advance i am

 enclosed find money order for two dollars for
 six months subscription to the au-story
 weekly beginning with the issue of november
  there is no other magazine that can equal the
 all-story weekly at the price i have been a
 constant reader of it for the last three years and
 usually purchase it at the news-stands but i am
 now on the farm out in the country and cannot
 get it without a lot of trouble i am in the
 theatrical business and i find quite a number of
 theatrical folks who read the all-story weekly

 i like e k means best of all your writers
 however there are a lot of real writers on your
 staff with best wishes i am

                       respectfully yours

                               sam hood

 please send me as soon as convenient to you
 the following numbers of the all-story
 weekly november   and december 
 am enclosing forty-five cents in stamps for same
  have been reading the all-story weekly for
 several years and have enjoyed every number i
 like your serials best my favorite authors are
 edgar rice burroughs george allan england j
 u giesy j b smith e k means captain
 dingle and many others hulbert footner is
 another one of my choicest the huntress
 couldnt be better  wish good luck to the
 all-story weekly as long as it lives hoping
  shall receive the copies i am

                           miss iuei weeks

 lava hot springs idaho

i have been a reader of the all-story weekly
for two years and the argosy for so long  can t
remember why cant we have a  different
story every week they are great i have no
certain author but for sea stories give me captain
dingle what year did  to the victor  appear

 in the all-stoky can  get the four numbers
 by sending for them

george hovey

    indianapolis indiana

   note - to the victor by harold titus was
 published in the all-story cavalier may  to
 june   four issues unfortunately these
 issues are now out of print but the story has
 been published in book form under the title
 - conquered by the rand-mcnally com-
 pany chicago illinois price  net you can
 probably procure it from your own book-dealer
 or from the publisher direct

    although not a regular subscriber to your all-
 story weekly i think it is the best of them all
 i buy mine at the news-stands which amounts to
 the same thing on account of changing places
 often i find it more convenient having a touch
 of cowboy blood i like all the western stories
 think the texan  immense and  stand right
 behind mr h dock of new jersey as an ad-
 mirer of  claire not only on account of her
 build but just naturally a real she-woman i
 am just itching to get hold of h r h the
 rider  it should be here on sale to-day if
 whistling dan with satan black bart and kate
 run along like they start out ive sure got a treat
 ahead the short -stories all speak for them-
 selves i only wish there were more of them
 in fact i dont find any that bore holes in me
 i read the verses too i wish there were more
 writers of verse like margaret g hays she puts
 the pep in her lines just keep tying your rope
 on all the best ones and the all-story weekly
 will have a life-long success

   just a line to let you know how i enjoy your
 magazine especially e k meanss stories when
 i read his story entitled  monkey lodge i
 loaned it to several of my friends and they
 vowed they wouldnt miss another of his stories
 for anything it is worth the price of your
 magazine just to read his stories next to e k
 means i liked the texan and i agree with
 mr pelky that we dont want to leave the poor
 fellow out in the woods with a rose in his hand
 so give us a sequel to it i dont agree with one
 of your readers who said the all-story weekly
 was the same as any other magazine but for a few
 stories in it j think no other magazine can
 come up to it the all-story weekly and the
 argosy are the only two magazines ive read since
 j got the first copy of them give us some more
 semi-dual stories and also some more by the
 author of steamboat gold george washing-
 ton ogden well ive my little say and will
 close now
