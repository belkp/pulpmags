how modest jim won

the  prize

by william lawrence

author of the awakening

es-i remember why they call the big boss

  jl modest jim  said the old timer it
started way back twenty years ago

  i was in my third apprentice year when jim
hadley came to work here--a quiet bashful boy
his father had died and he was forced to leave
grammar school and go to work

  he was never among the groups of boys dodg-
ing the boss or watching the clock nor mixed up in
anything that wasnt strictly business and he
never fooled away -his time with the bunch after
hours so we left him pretty much to himself we
called him modest jim

  one day old man adams who owned this out-
fit in those days came out into the shop and tacked
up a sign over the foremans desk

  it seemed that the old man and his designer
had run into a stone wall or what was greek to
most of us kids those days and was offering a prize
of fifty dollars to anyone who solved the problem
he must have been up against it or he never would
have asked ouc bunch for help

  about two weeks later after the rest of us
had forgotten all about it the old man rushed
out to jim and fairly pushed five crisp ten dollar
bills into his hand he had solved the problem

  when the foreman asked him how he did it
he replied oh it wasnt anything great only
a fresh brain on a stale subject thats all he
ever said about it but do you know what that
boy had been doing hed been studying with the
international correspondence schools in his spare
time no wonder he got ahead

  and he went right up and up and up until
today he is the big boss and thp rest of us are
just rbout where we started hes still modest
jim but hes earning five times as much as i am

  take my advice lad and follow along in jims
footsteps dont wait until its too late to get the
special training that is so essential to success

  employers everywhere are looking for men like
modest jim-men who want to get ahead-who
are willing to devote a par of their spare time to
training for advancement

  how much longer are you going to wait before
taking the step that is bound to bring you a better
job and more money

   isnt it better to make your start now than to
 wait a year or five years and then wish you had
 it certainly is

   no matter where you live the i c s will come
 to you no matter what your handicaps or how
 small your means we have a plan to meet your
 circumstances no matter how limited your previous
 education the simply-written wonderfully-illus-
 trated i c s lessons make it easy to learn no
 matter what career you may choose some one of
 the  i c s courses will surely suit your needs

it is fortunate for hupmobile owners
that our engineers have large manu-
facturing facilities at their exclusive
command

in the hupmobiles own plants motor
transmission clutch axles and other
essential parts are built to hupmobile
design for the exclusive use of the
hupmobile

no compromise of good designing or
fine manufacturing is ever forced upon
our engineers they are entirely free
from limitations they might meet if they
were dependent for some vital parts
on outside manufacturing sources

through years of experience they have
developed a perfect harmony among
working parts that tends to increase the

economy and efficiency of individual
units and of the entire assembly

this may explain hupmobile perform-
ance- the kind of performance that
means sailing up the average low-gear
hill on high gear and plugging
through sand and mud on high

the kind of pick-up that gets you
away and free from city-street snarls
brilliant performance not only when
the car is new but as long as it lasts
with the very minimum of tinkering
and adjusting

this may explain also economy rec-
ords that stand almost alone among
cars of higher and lower price alike
and such a length of life that it seems
a hupmobile has no wear-out point

we can reconstruct the whole of human history

ell you know how the firm of
grim ramsden  ross had its
beginnings we have had to
use all our wits to save ourselves
from being used by one government against
another rivals for political power have
tried to employ us for their own ends and
have succeeded more than once youd
need the brains of an archangel and satan
combined to see through all the proposals
that get brought to us but theres reason-
able money in it and its good fun weve
cracked a hard-boiled egg or two and spilled
some beans

strange gave grim sole charge of the
near-east end purchased narayan singhs

moses and mrs aintree copyright  by talbot mundy

discharge from the army and left the two
of them in cairo planting jeremy in
london

  strange and i went to the states where
with the aid of his old office staff we ham-
mered through the organizing and incor-
poration and while we were in the middle
of all that the first view forward came
over the wires from grim strange was in
washington

  meet john brice new york s s olympic ok
follow up grim

  i boarded the olympic along with the
pilot away outside sandy hook it was
early morning but brice was pacing the
deck with a companion and i observed
them both for several minutes after a stew-
ard had told me who they were

  brice was short with a close-clipped gray
beard wiry dried out and resolute-looking

adventure

he stepped forward gamely with a decided
limp and made way for other people ap-
parently unconsciously i guessed his age
between fifty and fifty-five

  his companion was about two inches
taller angular and lean a scot whichever
way you viewed him a fellow with one of
those noses that warn you not to waste
persuasion on him hell decide for himself
he had heavy sandy-colored eyebrows
broad shoulders and a sort of side-swing
that went with them he wore a heather-
colored highland tam-o-shanter and a small
leather bag slung over his shoulder by a
strap the steward told me his name was
allison and that he had shared brices
stateroom on the voyage

  i introduced myself and brice chose one
of those leather-upholstered corners in the
smoking-room and curled himself up cross-
legged staring at me frankly and fairly
he made no effort to disguise the fact that
he was making an inventory of my pros
and cons his companion seated next to
him did the same perhaps not quite so
sympathetically

  we met grim in cairo brice began at
last allison and i are egyptologists
weve been nineteen years in egypt on be-
half of the british museum the egyp-
tian law as regards antiquities is strict and
no kind of excavating is allowed without a
permit which is only granted to represen-
tatives of such institutions as the british
museum the metropolitan museum of
new york and so on all discoveries
have to be reported and nothing may be
removed from the spot without permission
in writing

  allison and i have specialized in the
period during which the israelites were in
egypt with particular referenceto moses
very little is known about moses histori-
cally speaking in the biblical account not
even the name is given of the egyptian
princess who is said to have discovered him
among the reeds it was our purpose if
possible to throw light on all that period
establishing as many facts as might be-

  and exploding a number of absur-r-d
traditions put in allison weve dis-
proved more than yed imagine possible

  we have established the fact definitely
that moses did exist brice continued
whether or not one man wrote the deca-
logue whether or not one individual led
that horde of israelites and established the

ten commandments and the law we have
proved that moses did exist he lived
at a time that corresponds roughly with that
of the israelitish colony in egypt our
proofs however are missing

  do you expect to find them in new
york i asked youll find moses family
is not extinct

  our quest has nothing to do with
jews brice answered the most as-
tonishing thing about the jewish race is
their indifference to the monuments of their
own past allison and i discovered a
temple in which moses undoubtedly studied
that learning of the egyptians with which
he is credited we found the symbols and in-
signia that he used in the performance of
the secret rites those have been stolen
and it might occur to you that jews would
be the logical people on whom suspicion
should rest but jews have nothing what-
ever to do with it

  we kept our discovery secret it was
so important and the finds themselves
were of such intrinsic value that it seemed
wisest to close up everything until we could
confer with the proper authorities regard-
ing the disposal of what could be easily
removed

     one of our staff was an abyssinian
fc an individual named gulad who had
been educated in america he had
served us faithfully for nine or ten years
and you know the proverb tf a comrade
in arms is what you need buy a nubian
slave if you want to grow rich buy an
abyssinian that fellow gulad was the
finest steward of resources that we ever had
nothing escaped his notice nobody-
not even a desert bedouin-could steal
from him and he was sufficiently educated
to appreciate the importance of antiquities
aside from the mere price they might bring
in the open market

  we had entered the temple through a
hole in one corner of the wall after tunneling
through sand for more than a hundred
yards shoring up the tunnel with timber
as we went most of the important finds
were in a great stone chest weighing several
tons almost the exact counterpart of the
so-called sarcophagus in the kings cham-
ber in the great pyramid only having a lid
that fits tightly in place the chest in
the great pyramid has no lid

  whatever had been found outside the
moses and mrs aintree



stone chest we placed inside it except for
one small item then with the aid of
gulad and ten men we lifted the lid back
cemented up the breach we had made in
the temple wall pulled down about a dozen
cross-pieces of timber from the roof of our
tunnel so as to let the sand fall in and close
the passage against thieves and came
away leaving gulad on the spot in charge
ye understand put in allison we
never mistrusted gulad for a minute
never for a minute brice agreed
he was as enthusiastic as ourselves he
used to sit and talk with us in the evenings
displaying an intricate knowledge of bible
history he had theories of his own on a
number of things that have puzzled anti-
quarians he could read hieroglyphics
we used to give him worn and broken
inscriptions to decipher and he had a fair
average of success with them

aye we were well taken in said alli-
son we might ha known its not in
the naturesof an honest black man to be re-
ceiving letters from all quarters of the globe
brice laughed

  it never occurred to us to ask what his
voluminous correspondence was about now
and then wed see him writing until long
after midnight in his tent by candle-light
wed see his shadow on the side of the
tent ye understand put in allison
we respected his privacy exactly as if he
were a white man like ourselves

  well brice continued we left gulad
in charge and took the train for cairo
that meant a day on camel-back before
we reached the railway and a day and a
night in the train when we reached
cairo galbraith the official we had to see
was away and we had to wait three days
for him

  when galbraith returned-he arrived
at midnight and we kept him up all that
night talking though he was tired out-
he thought our news so important that he
made up his mind to return with us and have
our find uncovered in his presence that
meant more delay one way and another
it was eleven days after our departure
before we arrived with galbraith at sunset
tired and hungry on the scene of our exca-
vations the camp had completely dis-
appeared there did not remain one trace
of it

  nothing to eat nowhere to go said
allison

  no lanterns or candles-nothing but a
box or two of matches-no servants except
the two arabs who had come with us to
look after the camels we rode-no firearms
-not a word of explanation nothing but
egyptian darkness and the black mouth of
a tunnel leading underground we slept
in the tunnel that night

  speak for yourself remarked allison
dryly

  when morning came there was a little
dim light down the tunnel for it points
due eastward and for a short while the ris-
ing sun penetrates almost to the end
we saw then that the tunnel was not as
we had left it the overhead beams had
been replaced the loose sand carried out
and then three beams had been removed
again to let sand once more block the tun-
nel in other words somebody had paid
a visit to our find

  it was three more days before we could
get together another gang and dig through
to our temple the digging took another
whole day and then we saw that whoever
had paid the visit in our absence hadnt
taken the trouble to reset the masonry
the hole yawned as wide as if wed never
blocked it up and nearly all the stones
were pushed inside the building

  i examined the cement at once said
allison the masonry had been broken
down before our backs were turned that
put outside conspir-racy out of the question
there was only one man who knew enough
and had intelligence enough to dig straight
to the spot and use crow-bars before the
cement was dry it was gulads doing
be that as it may said brice we
proceeded to examine the temple its a

wonderful temple-

  per-r-fect exclaimed allison the
pattern and inspiration of the chastity of
later greek design but well not bore
ye with technicalities proceed

  nothing in the main hall had been
touched said brice we entered the
smaller priests chamber at the rear in
which we had discovered the great stone
chest and i told you how we had replaced
the lid that lid weighed a ton it was
set leaning against a wall the stone chest
was empty absolutely emptyl

  man yed have wept said allison
there were portraits done on gold of thir-r-
ty-two initiates of the mystery with their
names inscribed and beneath each portrait


adventure

was writing of a kind never before unearthed
in an egyptian temple do ye know
sanskrit look at this this is the single
item we took with us that convinced gal-
braith hed better come back with us

  allison undid his leather satchel and
unwrapped from tissue paper a rectangular
gold plate about nine inches by six and more
than a quarter of an inch in thickness
its weight was prodigious one side was
entirely covered with writing etched into
the soft metal allison laid that side down-
ward on the table and bade me consider
the obverse

  dont touch thats moses he said
sitting back to enjoy the expression of my
face

the gold had been cut away
smoothly to leave a portrait of a
man in high relief my previous
mental picture of moses had been taken
from the cover of a school atlas i imagined
a man wth whiskers like those of the man
of liskeard in the limerick breaking in
his fury two stone tablets by the light of
lightning and kicking over a golden calf
while crowds of israelites prostrated them-
selves in terror before him

  the picture i had in mind of him was
gigantic-six or seven times as big as other
men-clothed in a thing like a purple bath-
robe and with his toes sticking out from
sandals that suggested seven-league boots

  this man had jewish features subtly
modified to pass egyptian scrutiny the
beard was trimmed and curled like those of
the statues of pharaoh and the head-
dress was the linen one of ancient egypt
including the jeweled brow-band shaped
like a snake

  yet it hadnt been done by an egyptian
artist you could easily recognize the
touch of an indian hand betrayed by the
skill with which the folds of cloth were
handled and a kind of alive compassionate
humanity that the egyptians never tried
to picture-having none

  it was a face that you could stare at by
the hour-attracting-fascinating-nothing
repellent about it-amazing it expressed
not only humor but the whole great cycle
of the virtues including wisdom not
wisdom as the egyptians represented t
static and cold wisdom that was so en-
tirely wise that it could sympathize and
laugh with instead of at ive never seen

anywhere a face like that one done in gold
in pharaohs day

  can ye read sanskrit demanded alli-
son that first line below the picture
reads-

   moses son o amram an initiate inducted to
these mysteries at the appointed time

  the lines below that and on the reverse
are the words of a hymn rather closely
resembling the rig veda but with signifi-
cant changes that suggest parts of the first
chapter of genesis its conclusive proof
that all known religion had its origin in
india as the indians have always main-
tained it proves that the man moses
was a living fact and ergo that theres at
least some truth in the legends attached
to his name

  man he exclaimed excitedly dye
realize that that sanskrit may be moses
actual handwriting that he may have
done it himself with a sharp tool after the
indian whoever he was had finished the
likeness d ye appreciate what that means
if we can get back the thirty-one others that
gulad the abyssinian stole we can recon-
struct the whole of human history

  well there we were steaming through
the narrows into new york harbor with a
yellow quarantine flag at the mast-head
staring at a portrait of moses who crossed
the red sea without half as much mechan-
ism to assist him and no steam at all we
were possibly handling a piece of gold that
moses actually touched

  its wonderful i said i hope you
succeed in catching gulad and recovering
the things he stole but i dont believe
this is a case that our firm would care to
handle you should try the regular de-
tective agencies

  wait while we tell you the rest of it
brice answered itll be hours yet before
the port authorities let us land

chapter ii

 moses miles

passengers began invading the
smoking-room but nobody interfered
with us

  it wasnt too late to preserve the
temple brice resumed galbraith sent
for a police guard after we had once more
blocked up the entrance and the three of us
moses and mrs aintree



returned to cairo to see what could be
done

  there are two ways of getting any-
where in egypt-the railway and the nile
theyre both easy to police said allison
if we had acted when we fir-r-st discovered

the theft the police might have-

  ive had dealings with gyppy police-
men i interrupted the size of the
bribe is the only question how did grim
get wind of this

  the heads of departments did their
best said brice but all the subordi-
nates are gyppies and the gyppies havent
learned anything in forty years the
police didnt lose the trail because they
never as much as pretended to pick it up
they said it was a mystery and shrugged
their shoulders

  and meanwhile said allison we had
to submit to sar-r-castic r-remar-r-ks from
men who never found more than imitation
scarabs in second-century tombs if ye
know what that means

  at last we had a talk with the high
commissioner brice resumed it was he
who suggested our seeing grim about it
yeve a genius in that man grim said
allison we found mr grims quarters
in cairo occupied by a sikh named narayan
singh who said be was grims confidential
assistant he asked us for the story and-
you know how they bring you coffee in
egypt at the least excuse well almost
before id started a servant brought in
coffee he didnt seem to know any
english when i asked him in english for
some cold water he didnt understand me
but instead of leaving the room after serving
coffee the man squatted on the mat by the
door and went into a sort of day-dream

  when id finished telling the story to
narayan singh the servant collected the
coffee cups and left the room i asked if
that was another of grims confidential
assistants

   why no the sikh answered that is
jimgrim sahib himself

  he came in presently in european
clothes and apologized explaining that we
had caught him unawares and that for the
sake of practise he habitually stood and
faced even little unimportant emergencies
as he wisely remarked big events are only
little ones projected on a larger scale

  mon the mons a genius said allison
  fortunately for us he knows the near

east like a book brice continued he
analyzed what we had given him and boiled
it down to the essential fact that gulad is
an abyssinian who was educated in the
u s a he found other abyssinians in
cairo and discovered that most of them
regarded gulad as a religious heretic or
backslider or something following that
trail grim took a quick trip to jerusalem
where there is an abyssinian church he
was gone four days and returned with a
light in his eye those abyssinians had
told grim all they knew about him
thats the beauty of releegion ex-
plained allison yeve always a thousand
coreleegionists getting ready to expose ye
at the proper time

   well it seems that after gulads return
from the united states he became a minor
official of that abyssinian church in jerusa-
lem however the seniors were jealous of
him he had studied mormonism in the
u s a with particular reference to its
success along business lines and he pointed
out that the colored people in the u s a
would prove a fertile field for propaganda
of the sort he had in mind but they
turned him down and the more he argued
of course the more points he provided them
on which to denounce him as a heretic
ye see explained allison all novelty
is heresy new ways of getting rich included
at any rate they turned him out of the
church said brice and between that
time and the day when he joined us he
made various unsuccessful efforts to become
a religious leader

  your friend grims reasoning wa mar-
velous he said to me that he considered
one point obvious if this fellow gulad
were a petty grafter he wouid have stolen
from you long ago but he didnt steal
he has had charge of your petty cash for
years and actually saved you lots of
money if he were a petty grafter he
might try to sell a goose that should lay
golden eggs being a patient schemer
hell set that goose to laying eggs instead
hell play for power you remember the
plates of gold that the mormons are said
to have that was all grim said to me
for several days

  but yell recall no doubt that i said
things to ye said allison yell remem-
ber my mentioning a per-r-fect catalogue o
new religious movements started by some
chiel possessing a relic


adventure

  brice ignored the interruption

  grim discovered in jerusalem that
gulads heresy for which the abyssinian
elders excommunicated him hinged on his
interpretation of the law of moses thats
important in the circumstances gulad has
in his possession thirty-one gold plates
covered with ancient writing each of them
bearing a portrait of a contemporary of
moses and found in a temple in which
moses officiated even if he cant read
sanskrit which is a practical certainty he
can show them to ignorant people and in-
terpret them to suit his plans

  and it becomes in consequence a verra
reasonable theory said allison that
gulad entered our service because he knew
we were sear-r-ching for evidence of moses
actual existence he persisted for about
nine years ye cant restrain a measur-r-e
of admir-r-ation for the r-rascals deliber-r-
ate per-r-tinacity

  i still dont see where grim ramsden
and ross enter into it i said

  grim saw at once youll see pres-
ently said brice just listen grim
pursued his inquiries day and night not
overlooking the important point that gulad
was educated in the u s a he made
another flying trip to jerusalem and this
time i went with him

     there was an american woman
in jerusalem about whom nobody
knew much she was posing as a
woman of wealth and making a clever
display with what small private means she
had you know how a certainsort of en-
thusiast worships the very stones of jerusa-
lem well she was that kind but she
seemed to want to own jerusalem

  grim and i called on her after making a
few inquiries the u s consul knew more
than he cared to tell for in answer to
grims questions he merely pursed his
lips and shook his head one or two
americans declared she was a rank im-
postor but that was very likely personal
pique she was apparently more of a social
climber than a politician impostor hardly
seemed the right word

  she was living in a pretty good house
outside the city walls that she had coaxed
from the administration at a low rent
she had a way of worshiping a handsome
british officer that some of them couldnt
easily resist

  forty i should say she is-forty-two-
somewhere around that age a big hand-
some woman with unusual blue eyes and
fine teeth she had quite a household-
four or five men and women from the states
-nonentities who did her bidding meekly
they seemed to consider her almost as
important as she thought herself and it was
from a very mild hen-pecked-looking man
of sixty that grim learned an important
point while we waited in the sitting room
she kept us waiting she is the kind of
person who does that

  when she came down at last grim had
pumped the hen-pecked person dry and
after a few of the usual banalities about the
weather and the zionists grim mentioned
the name of a mutual acquaintance in
cairo the personage being rather im-
portant she claimed to know him better than
she really did which suited grims purpose
exactly in that apparently purposeless
way of his he touched on the subject of her
home town somewhere in west virginia and
said untruthfully that the mutual acquaint-
ance had told him that she was the leader
of quite an important sect there accord-
ing to grim this mutual acquaintance had
said that in west virginia isobel aintree
was a name to conjure with it was the
hen-pecked person who had said that
really

  she was visibly disturbed but walked
straight into the trap he had touched her
vanity she couldnt resist showing off
she had never mentioned this sect of hers to
anybody in jerusalem but once she was
under way grim wouldnt let her stop
he pretended to find it the most interesting
subject in the world and under his fire of
questions she admitted rather vaguely that
her teaching was based on the law of
moses

  she came down finally under his per-
sistent questioning to the bald fact that her
sect has twenty-seven white adherents and
several hundred colored none of whom were
with her in jerusalem she said she felt
that her mission in life was to benefit the
colored people and she had hopes that the
sect would grow that brought up the
subject of gulad

  she admitted that she knew gulad
she had received correspondence from him
she had met him in egypt on her way to
palestine grim pinned her down again
by saying he knew gulad intimately
moses and mrs aintree



he spoke rather as if gulad were somebody
whom only discerning people knew how to
appreciate and the rather subtle flattery of
that proved too much for her discretion
she admitted that gulads correspondence
had provided the main incentive for her
journey to jerusalem she had hoped with
his assistance to make jerusalem head-
quarters of a sect that would some day in-
clude hundreds of thousands of colored
people in all quarters of the world

  there was nothing superficially vicious
about that of course scores of people have
tried the same sort of thing and a few have
succeeded most of them go to the wall
sooner or later it looked like a single
case of personal ambition masquerading as
divine fire but grim asked her quite
casually when she had seen gulad last
and her whole character lay bare that
instant

  she wanted to lie but that hen-pecked
person was watching her as if pearls of
price were pouring from her lips she
hesitated palpably flushed red tried to
laugh it off and floundered

   really mr grim id rather not an-
swer that question i must ask you to
excuse me

  from the look on his face youd have
thought grim was shocked by the very
idea of being inquisitive she hinted it was
time to go but he sat still and flattered her
a little more that woman can eat up
flattery like a furnace swallowing coal he
said that he should think she was the very
woman to make something of gulad

   the fellow needs a guiding hand he
told her they say he has  great plans
do you know anything of them

  she flushed and refused to commit her-
self grim asked her how long she ex-
pected to remain in jerusalem and she an-
swered that she felt her work in the holy
city was about done she might go at any
time then we took our leave and dis-
covered that evening by asking questions
all over the place that she was planning to
leave for the states as soon as she could get
passage

still we hadnt lfcally connected
her up with gulad we merely had
strong suspicions amounting in
grims case to intuition wed no ground
on which to accuse her and as grim re-
marked she was likely to be careful of her-

self  shes the kind of person he said
who likes to save the world by making her
followers take chances shes a kind of
spiritual politician if an idea works its
hers if it failsjts the other fellows and
shell be the first to blame him

  a great student of character is your
friend grim everything turned out the
way he said it would

 we went up to headquarters and
dropped a hint that she might be intending
to smuggle antiquities out of the coun-
try and then grim thought of another
idea

   gulad he said isnt likely to trust
that plunder to anothers keeping shes
probably much too wise to risk being caught
with the goods at present if theyre in
cahoots as he called it therell be some
slick work done

  we went back to egypt and searched the
files of permits to travel and found to our
astonishment that a passport had been is-
sued to a man named gulad described as a
french subject of abyssinian origin who
had already left from port said by a
steamer that called nowhere short of boston
there was a warrant out so we sent a cable-
gram and arranged to have gulad arrested
as soon as the ship reached port in about
seventeen days time now id have sat
down and waited after that but grim
didnt he inserted a few lines in the
newspaper and sent a marked copy to mrs
isobel aintree in jerusalem also he
tipped off all the customs officials to keep a
bright look-out and arranged by telegraph
to have word sent to us of all her plans
you see we thought shed have to engage
passage and apply for a travel permit

  but that woman is a wily one she had
obtained her permit two months before
available for six months entitling her to
travel in any direction she pleased she
sent a man down to book tickets on the
train for egypt and we got word of that
within two hours over the government wire
then if you please she shipped the bulk of
her luggage by freight to the united states
including nothing in it of course that was
objectionable and left northward for syria
in two motorcars with her household
didnt use the train at all on british terri-
tory

  the arab government had fallen and the
french had not yet secured control there
were no officials at the border to hold her up


adventure

once over the border she took train for
damascus where the french were only too
glad to put her on the train for beirut with
every facility for leaving syria at once

  the motor-cars were hired ones when
they returned from over the border the
news was out there were two separate
accounts from two drivers and copies of
both were wired to grim checking them up
he reached the conclusion that a colored
man described as her kavass who traveled
with the party might be gulad he went
to jerusalem in a hurry for the third time
and decided that the fellow certainly was
gulad so the plot began to clear decidedly
gulad was in her house when we first called
on her another man traveling in gulads
name had shipped from port said to the
united states with a french passport and
thats the point that baffled us

  you see the original warrant for gulads
arrest had been issued over the french
consuls signature when we went to the
consulate again to ask to have the french
authorities in beirut arrest that whole
party gulad included we found ourselves
in check-mate the man in charge was
a typical bureaucrat who asked whether
there were two gulads a warrant had
already been issued gulad was on his way
to boston where he would be arrested by
the united states police no man could
possibly be in beirut and on the high seas
simultaneously and therefore that he
would not issue another warrant be-
cause he did not propose to make himself
absurd

  well we tried to approach the french
in beirut more directly but the cable was
out of order it is when international
incidents are taking place the overland
wire by way of palestine had been cut-by
bedouins the french said a coincidence
that must have saved their censor a lot of
trouble the long and short of that was
that mrs aintree and her party gulad in-
cluded got clear away from beirut and
in spite of all the ridiculous passport formal-
ities at every frontier they contrived to
cross europe without our being able to
learn which route they had taken until the
information was too belated to be any use
so much for passports

  we finally traced them to london and
grim cabled to jeremy ross to pick the
trail up there he cabled back the same
day to the effect that he had got in touch

meanwhile grims assistant
the sikh narayan singh proceeded
on the assumption that gulad could
not be wholly without intimates after nine
years in egypt

  that was my idea explained allison
it appealed to my sense of the rideeculous
that any man should ignore the cir-r-cum-
stance of gulad having fr-r-equently re-
ceived veesitors in camp and the equally
impor-r-tant cir-r-cumstance that every
one o the veesitors was black they used
to spend days at a time in our camp i
was at some pains on more than one occa-
sion to discover whether they were being
enter-r-tained at our expense and was
gr-ratified as well as surpr-r-ized to ascer-
tain that they paid their own footing

  as long as he accounted in full for our
stores and petty cash it was only reasonable
to accord him the preevileges due to any
self-respecting man nevertheless the un-
precedented meticulousness of his honesty-
in such a land as egypt mind ye with
brice and me not scr-r-upling to feed our
own guests from the expeditions stores-
aroused my curiosity so i discussed the
matter with narayan singh and he and i
together ar-r-ived at certain definite con-
clusions however ye were speaking brice
continue

  well said brice narayan singh dis-
covered quite a little colony of u s darkies
more or less distributed in alexandria
port said and cairo quite a number were
sailors who had deserted under your pecu-
liar shipping law some were harder to ac-
count for on any theory of lawful activity
but they all seemed to eke out a living and a
few were prosperous they were dis-
tinctly possessed of class-consciousness
mainly evidenced by insolence toward white
men who chanced into contact with them

  among them were quite a number of
the missionary-preacher type narayan
singh found at least a dozen who were
living off the rest in fairly easy circum-
stances four or five seemed to be well
educated and at least one-a man named
moses miles-had a bank account i
want you to notice that name moses it
proved to be an important clue

  we let moses miles carefully alone at
first and made a study of the others it
would not have been the slightest use for a
white man to approach any of them but
their distrust and resentment directed at
moses and mrs aintree

ii

all white men apparently made them all the
more inclined to accept the confidence of
the sikh i dont pretend to explain it
but theres the fact they seemed to de-
spise the native african to loathe the
white man and to regard the indian as a
possible friend

  narayan singh discovered that moses
miles was preaching a new brand of religion
among those darkies his name it ap-
pears was not originally moses but
horatio augustus he changed it when he
adopted the new creed the doctrine
hinges on mosaic law and every initiate
into its mysteries has to change his first
name to moses only initiates are al-
lowed to preach other members are
known as aspirants and their chief duty
seems to be to contribute handsomely to the
support of the initiates but there is an
intricate ritual that-

  verra heathenish abominable rites
growled allison changing his position
restlessly

  - a ritual that is much too cleverly de-
vised to have been worked out by moses
miles who possesses a dominant personal-
ity and education of a kind but no really
high order of intelligence narayan singh
sought admission to the sect-people of
pisgah they call themselves he failed
but he found out this that these people of
pisgah through moses miles were mo-
mentarily awaiting instructions from the
united states on receipt of which and
accompanying funds four of their initiates
and eight aspirants were to leave for
south africa and begin an intensive all-
black campaign among the natives there-
a campaign consisting of religion mixed
with politics and the interesting point is
this that the name of the great high-
priestess whose orders they awaited is
isobel aintree

chapter iii

a p  p original charier member

	 hat liner had a clean bill of health
but did not proceed to her pier there
began to be indignation meetings wherever
there was room for twenty passengers to get
together but i noticed my friend casey
of the federal secret service

   casey regards the public as a herd of silly
sheep with goats distributed among the

herd at intervals regarded in the main he
doesnt love them but i suspect that like
a good sheep-dog he would grow old before
his time and die of sheer disgust if deprived
of his job and wherever casey strolls 
with both fists in his pockets and a look of
bland indifference on his round red face
you may safely bet there are human wolves
or goats to be fixed to rights as he de-
scribes it

  after an hour or two he strolled into the
smoking room and noticed me 

  where are you from this time he de-
manded sitting down beside us china
borneo

  i told him and came back with the obvi-
ous question

  oh nothing much said casey we
got our man wed no picture of him and
didnt know what name hed travel under
but hes locked in his stateroom now with
a bull to keep him company  well be
alongside in about an hour i hear yeve
gone into the detective business with mel-
drum strange ye look like it my boy
yell have to learn never to look interested
unless theyre clever men whore making
trouble its not interesting at all and if
they are clever ye cant afford to let em
worry ye

  judge for yourself i answered this
looks like a case for you not me youll
admit its interesting and romantic

  then it certainly isnt for me theres
no romance in my business ramsden my
boy i deal in card-indexes and photygraffs
and thumb-prints romance looks pretty
in the newspapers and the books o doctor
conan doyle but romance and crime
dont mix no more than the smell of onions
mixes with ice-cream sodies but ive an
hour and im willing to be amused which
are ye going to do-talk elephants an gold-
mines which i believe ye know about or
discuss this marvelous romantic case with
me like a hen discussing water with a duck

  i preferred the farm-yard to the zoo and
made a start by introducing brice and
allison

  now take his breath away i said
produce the gold plate

  he studied it in silence for a minute

  a picture of moses eh ive seen jews
look like him take a stroll with me and
ill point out to ye twenty or thirty men
who might have sat for that picture i
suspect yeve man-handled the thing so


adventure

that the thumb-prints are all overlaid
whats the writing all about some sort
o code have ye a key to it it dont look
to me like yiddish

  casey turned the plate over and over
holding it by the edges for he regards
thumb-prints as other men do first editions

  never mind he went on criminol-
ogically speaking moses is dead how do
ye propose to get this gold plate through
the customs have ye declared it whos
set a value on it

  we havent declared it brice answered
we have a permit authorizing us to take
it out of egypt in trust allison and i are
personally responsible for it without this
one we might find it difficult to identify
absolutely the thirty-one others that were

stolen whereas with this-

  casey whistled hes a man of habit like
the rest of us the first bars of the last line
of the chorus of a song that was beginning
to grow whiskers in the war with spain
form his invariable only war-cry-
therell be a hot time---

  have ye traced the thief over here
yed better tell me all about it here ill
slip it in me pocket and yell have no
trouble with the customs men which
hotel all right ill give it back to ye at
the waldorf this afternoon ill take good
care of it now tell me all ye know

  brice laughed it might be a tall order
to tell all he knew

  well said casey i understand yeve
come after thirty-wan plates like this wan
tis a big country where theres room to
hide such trifles

  trifles exploded allison theyre as
impor-r-tant as old testament manu-
scripts

  the -you say have ye any idee

who took them that might help

  brice mentioned gulads name

  gulad gulad let me think a minute
there was a man named gulad let me
see yes i remember we held him in
boston colored man the english would
send from aygypt for him hell be sent
back to where he came from ye can arrest
him over there in aygypt

  who cares about him snorted allison
we believe that the real gulad is over here
and that either he or a mrs isobel aintree
has the plates

  aintree aintree isobel aintree
where have i heard that name said casey

ohyes go ahead tell me some more

  his eyes had a harder keener look

  according to mr ross the representa-
tive in london of grim ramsden and ross
she returned to the united states by way of
london bringing the real gulad with her
and also presumably those gold plates said
brice

  but how did gulad get into the states
casey demanded

  it seems hes a citizen gulad applied
for in london and obtained an american
passport the witnesses who identified him
were isobell aintree and two of her followers
who all swore to having known him for a
number of years

  ah its easy when theyve been
naturalized said casey i havent a
doubt he landed safely if hed papers be-
tween you and me and that sideboard
yonder if the lincoln memorial in washing-
ton d c was missing overnight id suspect
mrs aintree as soon as any wan she has
a new religion i believe and wans enough
well were coming alongside ill say a
word to the customs superintendent thatll
save ye time

j having seen brice and allison
to the hotel i went to the office
where i found two letters on top of
the morning pile one from grim and the
other from jeremy grims was short and
to the point

   confirming my wire brice and allison are  k
in all respects re theft consult the federal police
our interest consists in unearthing a conspiracy to
control the colored races of the world head-
quarters in u s a will report egyptian develop-
ments as fast as they occur and await instructions
james schuyler grim

  jeremys on the other hand ran to ten
or eleven pages and included a humorously
accurate description of brice and allison
he wrote

   theres a sort of colored revival combining relig-
ion and politics and using a secret religious ritual
to bind all the darkies together mrs aintree is
perhaps the head of it and she and gulad are as
thick as thieves she seems to have a hold on him
or else he has on her i hardly know which i dont
know what they have done with the stolen plates

  there is a dusky bishop here-he calls himself
an initiate-who undoubtedly has seen them
calls himself moses johnson he is from balti-
more and the name on his passport is charles
abraham ulysses johnson he is preaching-since
he saw the aintree woman-about the return of
moses to lead all african peoples into a promised
moses and mrs aintree



land of their own and he says that whereas the
law was written formerly on stone tablets it is
graven on gold plates now together with portraits
of the angels-thirty-one of them he says and he
claims to know the name of every angel on the list
all the texts he uses in his sermons are from the
book of exodus and his favorite one seems to be
the part about how the israelites spoiled the egyp-
tians looting all their gold and silver before they
started for the promised land cable instructions-
jeremy

  a little before three oclock i called on
brice and allison who were discussing their
prospects rather gloomily in a bedroom
allison had made his mind up that my friend
casey was an impostor who would melt
down that gold plate and turn it into cash

  in which case he was saying as i
entered the smoke-filled room you and i
brice are discr-r-edited and ruined men
nor are we entitled to sympathy were
simpletons

  allison refused to be comforted by me
he had reached the stage of doubting every-
thing and everybody

  mon i know nothing at all about ye
he protested

  however casey came in presently well
pleased with himself and laid the gold plate
on the bed

  ive a man id like ye to meet shall
i bring him in

there appeared an undersized
wizened colored man who stood in
the door spinning a derby hat on one
finger eying us all nervously he wasnt
actually crippled but produced the effect
by shrugging himself up inside a blue serge
suit a size or two too large for him his
white collar was about four sizes too big
and he had a thin neck like a tortoises all
wrinkled horizontally as if he could lengthen
or shorten it at will what with gold-
rimmed spectacles white spats over brown
shoes and a big diamond ring he was a
strange enough apparition even for new
york

  you all wanted me he asked

  his voice was wistful the expression
of his mouth was somewhere between a
smile and the beginning of a shout for help
he was bold and yet fearful and suspicious
as one who has made up his mind to a course
but dreads the consequences

  come in stand there said casey
and the colored man obeyed tell these
gentlemen what your name is

  they calls me aloysius jackson
  where are you from demanded casey

casey demanded

  missis isobel aintree is de lods ap-
pointed leader in this heah present dispensa-
tion misto casey shes white folks
aloysius jackson folded both hands in
front of him and stood easy apparently
throwing one hip clear out of joint it
seemed that as far as he was concerned
having white folks for a leader settled
everything casey thought otherwise
where is mrs aintree he demanded
de lod knows

  so do you in new york

  aloysius jackson opened and shut his
mouth and his adams apple moved but
he said nothing

  youve seen her this morning havent

laid on not to make no mention o the move-
ments of de leader of de p o p i claims

  aloysius jacksons face underwent a
subtle change of color and then set hard
casey continued

lowed his adams apple regurgitated it

 youve heard about em maybe
 aloysius jackson swallowed his adams
 apple again and looked miserable but
 didnt answer	

 all right said casey ever hear of
 a man named gulad

 no sir

 that answer was prompt and obviously
 truthful you could see by the look of
 relief on the colored mans face that he was
 glad to be able to answer unguardedly at
 last but casey wasnt satisfied

 she was in jerusalem you know that
moses and mrs aintree 



 how many people returned in her party
 seven sah the sacred numbah
 sah

 good there were six when she left the
 states who is the seventh

 misto casey sah

 i mean where was it that you hoard him
 talk

 aloysius johnson closed his mouth tight
 and put both hands into his hip pockets
 ah dont xacly member sah

 show him that gold plate said
 casey turning suddenly to allison and
 allison unwrapped it carefully

 ever see one like it casey de-
 manded

 no sah

 he was obviously lying his eyes nearly
 popped out of his head and he fidgeted
 nervously shifting from foot to foot

 youve seen a couple o dozen or more of
 em recently now havent you

 no sah

 all right said casey thats as good
 as yes

 he opened the door and whistled a plain-
 clothes policeman appeared

 take him downstairs and keep an eye
 on him until you hear from me he ordered
 and aloysius jackson went out as he came
 in walking like a cripple

chapter iv

his name was gulad

the door had no sooner shut on aloysius
jackson than caseys air of optimism
left him

  yeve a bad case he said the plates
werent stolen from ye they were taken
from this old temple whiles yr backs were
turned and maybe thats agin the law of
agypt but ye havent proved that this man
gulad took them nor what he did with
them if mrs aintree has them how are ye
going to prove that she didnt come by
them legally possession me boy is nine
points of the law that colored man who
came to boston under the name o gulad
will be sent back for its illegal to enter the
country under a false name but the real
gulad whos a citizen didnt change his
name until after he got here and he has
a perfect right to call himself moses or
murphy if he wants to as long as his pass-
port is o k

  yeve got to prove first that the gold
plates exist at all except in somebodys
imagination then yeve got to prove that
he has no right to them and that you have
the right to charge him with the theft
then yell have to produce an extradition
warrant and on top o that yell have to
satisfy a judge that hes the identical man
and that theres evidence enough to justify
his extradition it dont look good to me
theres no law against importing bullion or
antiquities this isnt a case for me at all
ive nothing to do with romance as i told
me friend ramsden this morning but
though the son-of-a-gun looks like an iliphant
ramsden is really as romantic as a school-
girl its a clear case for him and his new
daytective company yed better hire
ramsden to look into the romantic ind of it
and ye might make use of aloysius jackson
to begin with

  how demanded brice and allison
together

  me friend jeff ramsden must consider
that its my guess that if that nigger is
brought to trial the jury will acquit him
but i can throw a scare into him and i will
ill see him prisently and send him up here
for ramsden to confabulate with and now
ill have to be leavin ye for ive work to do
me friend jeff ramsden knows how to get
in touch with me at any time
i

adventure

  brice and allison sat looking at each
other gloomily they didnt recover even
when aloysius jackson came shambling in
again

  but aloysius jackson was another who
had not recovered he was suffering from
the appleton west virginny blues-sick
at the stomach with dread of terence casey
and the law and of me in the bargain
when i shifted my bulk to answer the bed-
room phone aloysius jackson jumped

  it was casey at the phone

  yr mans amenable he advised me
and the bull downstairs had a session with
him and hell eat out o your hand from
now forward keep him scared and threat-
en him with me if he gets sassy

  casey rang off and i surveyed aloysius
jackson for a minute in addition to him i
had to impress brice and allison for a mis-
trustful client is bad and two are worse-
especially if one of the two is a normally
suspicious scotsman i didnt feel nearly
as confident as i may have looked

  nigger i said do you want to die
  no sah misto ramsden

  do you want to be all smashed up with
this

  i showed him a fist and neither of mine is
ornamental

  mr ramsden sah ah nevo done you
no harm

  youve got to do me some good

  ahs shoh willin

  where does mrs aintree stay

   partment seven roscoe house river-
side drive sah

  where are the p o p meetings held

said i and if you dont hold your tongue
you know whats coming to you

  misto ramsden sah they search that
air gallery fr strangers you-all is a
stranger

  youre the one who does the searching
then i answered no back talk your

only chance of a whole skin is to do exactly
as youre told

  yessah misto ramsden

  meet me at my office tomorrow evening
at six-thirty

he slunk out of the room look-
ing utterly despondent it was
tough to have to go back on the
white folks who had bailed him out of the
tombs ive met colored men who wouldnt
have done it however scared they might be
for being afraid has nothing to do with
being yellow the test is will you jettison
your friends to save yourself or to save
them will you swallow your gruel-scream-
ing or smiling-it doesnt really matter
which there is no other criterion aloysi-
us jackson was yellow

  that night i received carte blanche from
meldrum strange who saw in a moment
the international significance of mrs ain-
trees doings

  shes playing for power some women
take to that quicker than hop he grunted
go after her hard spare no expense
follow up without waiting to consult me
but keep me posted

  it was nine oclock when i left him
i went straight from his hotel to roscoe
house on riverside drive to call on mrs
aintree and i had the advantage of her
for she did not know me from adams
off ox

  it wasnt exactly easy to get to see her
though for her corps of followers had a sys-
tem for keeping unwelcome visitors outside
the door they seemed to regard her as a
she-pope whom it would be sacrilege to
intrude upon however the janitor down-
stairs regarded her otherwise he said he
intended to ask the agent to put her out
because all the other tenants were com-
plaining

  she rented the apartment furnished
he said came alone and asked particu-
larly whether the house was quiet didnt
want dogs children or noisy house-parties
looked good to me and i fell she moved
in with five others and theyve been uceiv-
ing colored people all day long ever since-
one after another-sometimes twos and
threes ive refused them the elevator
theyve had to walk up but they keep on
coming one comes half-a-dozen times a
day hes up there now if im not mis-
taken
moses and mrs aintree



  i was met at the apartment door by five
of the inner-guard and said that i brought
news from jerusalem for mrs aintrees
private ear they were meek but meek-
ness is a much more difficult thing to deal
with than audacity they stuck to it that
they were qualified to receive any message
for mrs aintree they insisted that she
was not at home to visitors and might
not be disturbed however i stumbled on
the combination presently

  my message is from moses in jeru-
salem i said ill tell it to nobody but
mrs aintree

  how did you discover her address
a mild man of sixty asked suspiciously

  moses of jerusalem referred me to
moses of new york said i and they let
me in

  is your name moses they asked me
but i couldnt guess the right answer to
that so said nothing

  the room i was ushered into was just the
place for a woman to sub-rent whose means
were nothing remarkable and who wanted
to make the utmost possible display there
was ten thousand dollars worth of furni-
ture in that one room-louis the lover
stuff all gilt and rosy cupids with mirrors
wherever there was room for one you
couldnt turn without seeing yourself re-
flected and you could see whoever else
was in the room from every possible angle
by the simple process of selecting the right
mirror

  mrs aintree came in presently and the
meek fraternity retired-two men and two
women all going out through the same door
without waiting to be told to the fifth mem-
ber of the household was in the kitchen for
i heard a clattering of dishes through the
open door

  there was plenty of time to look at mrs
aintree for she waited until the last of her
team had left the room and tried the door
after them to make sure it was properly
closed i saw her from every viewpoint

      she weighed considerably more
than two hundred pounds but car-
ried the weight well she would
pass for a fine big woman a low-necked
green and gold evening dress displayed her
heavy shoulders and exaggerated the for-
ward tilt of her neck producing an effect of
great power it was probably power of will

but there was somehow a suggestion of the

   

washtub and physical strength won by lean-
ing over it

  her hair was carefully curled and dressed
a shade between brown and gold she had
a fine bold forehead that could wrinkle into
angry vertical creases when she chose to be
overbearing and her big full face was al-
most manly she might have been a tom-
boy in her teens and never have lost the
yearning to compete with men

  but her most remarkable features were
her eyes and mouth the eyes were mag-
nificent large and brilliantly blue looking
frankly at you not afraid to challenge
possessed of a certain humor too that
seemed to boast of seeing through you and
being on the whole amused her lips were
perpetually parted displaying fine white
teeth a little too widely spaced the two
upper incisors touched her lower lip and
gave the key to her character-vampire
will-power drawing sustenance from living
people that woman had no use for dead
ones

  i suspected her of considerable subtlety
when put to it but she chose to open on me
with the crudest kind of hail-fellow-well-
met stuff that ever a stock-salesman prac-
tised

  mr ramsden so glad to meet you
i was a little disturbed by an unknown
caller at this hour but the first glance
reassured me we become psychologists
dont we as we gain experience id know
you instantly for a man of calm and honor-
able purpose im sure youve something
tremendously interesting to talk about

  i have said i and she looked hard
at me

  subtlety may be good but i have none
and i hate it dont want any

  ive come to talk about your p o p
society i said

  do you mean that you wish to join the
p o p she asked

  i want to know about it what is its
basis

  the mosaic law

   is it a secret society

  no she answered how can any
universal law be a secret but the mosaic
law has always been misinterpreted it
was held to apply in the first place to the
israelites in egypt and to them only but
there is nothing universal about that
every race every people must eventually
have its moses who will bad them out of
	adventure

bondage and everybody is a moses who
knows what moses knew and acts as he
did

  everything included i asked her

  how is one to make exceptions she
asked who shall draw the line and
where

  murder and spoiling the egyptians are
not objectionable i asked her

  killing isnt always murder she re-
torted nor is spoiling the egyptians
theft-if done in the right way moses
said thou shalt not steal but he spoiled
the egyptians

  and you are preaching that to ignorant
people i asked her

  everyone is ignorant who doesnt un-
derstand the law of moses she retorted
my field however is among the colored
races who need their moses as badly as
ever the israelites needed theirs

  have you thought of the consequences
i asked if they interpret literally your
teaching that killing is not murder spoiling
isnt theft can you imagine what might
take place in the united states for in-
stance

  what happened to the egyptians she
answered tyranny entrenched has no
rights that anybody need respect if people
insist on suppressing the colored races they
must take the consequences just as the
egyptians did if the british insist on
suppressing the colored races within their
borders they must also take the conse-
quences the same applies to the french
the portuguese the spaniards the brazili-
ans the italians-to every people that is
holding colored races in subjection

  and why should you be the moses for
the colored races i asked youre not
colored

  no she said neither was moses an
israelite whoever understands the law of
moses becomes a moses i accept no re-
sponsibility i teach i do not make laws
but teach the law that was propounded on
sinai centuries ago

  why do you call your sect the p o p
i asked

  people of pisgah it was from pisgah
that moses saw the promised land my
followers rise to pisgah heights and see
what lies before them they become proph-
ets in a degree that depends on indi-
vidual inspiration and zeal

  do they perform miracles i asked

casting about for questions that  might
tempt her to keep on talking

  they become able to accomplish their
purposes in ways that unenlightened people
can not understand i will give you an
instance just as the israelites were given
laws engraved on stone tablets and the
mormons have writing on gold we needed
a standard by which to test our authority
and our actions well you are familiar
with the bible mr ramsden you recol-
lect how patient moses was how he went

into the wilderness for forty years-

  yes i said he murdered an egyptian
and ran away into hiding

  he found what he needed in the wilder-
ness she answered severely an initiate
of ours did the same thing he too went
into the wilderness-the same egyptian
wilderness in considerably less than forty
years he was led to find exactly what was
needed-the law engraved on gold by the
very hand of the original moses himself
id like to see that i suggested

  mr ramsden that is presumption
among the israelites none was allowed to
enter the holy of holies you must attain
to the level of high-priesthood before it
would be even safe to show you what our
initiate found that initiate of ours was
led to find the gold plates through great
self-abnegation and sincerity and none can
get the right to see what he found in any
other way

  was his name gulad i asked her and
she looked startled but recovered in-
stantly

  yes she said his name was gulad
  mameluke gulad

  yes but he has taken the name of
moses that is the prerogative and in fact
the duty of all initiates

  id like to see him i said is he in
new york

  she paused a long time before answering
that finally she lied by innuendo

  no she said you cant see him at
present possibly

  the janitor told me that he is in your
apartment now

  that janitor she smiled but looked
hideously angry-then fell back on flattery

  mr ramsden she said at last i told
you that those who understand the law of
moses attain to more than the usual
measure of discernment it is clear to me
that you are no ordinary man whether
moses and mrs aintree



you are destined to be one of us or not i
do not know but i feel impelled to grant
your request honesty is a key that opens
doors

she pressed an electric button and
the door was opened by the meek
man of sixty who smiled like a
verger viewing a bishop at close quarters
she tossed him her order and in another
minute in came gulad the meek individual
closing the door behind him silently

  moses this is mr ramsden he has
expressed a strong desire to see you

  gulad-moses looked irritated he was
black of countenance with quite a lot of
yellow in the whites of his brown eyes
patient i dare say cynical certainly
dressed in black evening clothes with a
fair-sized diamond in his shirt-front an
upstanding lithe figure as are many abys-
sinians but with the unmistakable abys-
sinian head that doesnt provoke confidence
whichever angle you view it from

  moses-gulad looked at me failed to make
me feel uncomfortable recognized my sus-
picion of him and made no effort to seem
friendly

  why do you wish to see me he de-
manded

  he stood with that sort of sneer on his
handsome lips that can be turned into a
smile on the instant if necessary-standing
deliberately close in order to compel me to
look up at him which is a trick understood
by most bullies it was mighty tempting
to send him staggering back on his heels

  i came to see those gold plates you
brought from the near east i answered

  who told you anything about them

  if youve never heard an abyssinian try-
ing to take the upper hand of a white man
you dont know insolence mrs aintree
looked positively scared and something
that may have been tact or may have been
just foolishness impelled me to save the
situation for her

  a gentleman named brice described
them to me i answered

  gulad-moses began to betray nervous-
ness but covered it pretty well

  mr brice will have to be arrested if he
tries to interfere with me he retorted
brice heard of my discovery and has been
trying ever since to get possession of the
plates on all sorts of pretexts he and
allison are nuisances-two crooks-who

dont yet realize what kind of man they
have to deal with tell them from me that
ive stood all the nonsense im going to
im not a public messenger said i
im interested in those gold plates

  he laughed cynically and turned his
back but the mirrors served my purpose
as well as his instead of his catching the
expression of my face offguard as he in-
tended he betrayed his own it was malig-
nant alert cunning and combined with
a dislike of me and a suddenly born distrust
of mrs aintree-or so i read it he threw
one swift look sidewise at her that should
have made her blood run cold if she had
seen it then facing suddenly about again
he sneered

  i suppose you are one of those news-
paper people tell your newspaper that
for a million dollars they may see the box in
which the plates are kept and that is all
really mr ramsden they cant be
shown to any except initiates mrs ain-
tree explained in an effort to calm the
atmosphere

  gulad-moses was beginning to pace the
floor and work himself into a passion

  already too many have seen them the
black man snarled pausing in front of her
too many fools have seen them i warned
you i warned you i warned you i told
you what would happen if you talked a
man is a fool to trust a woman you ad-
mitted to this person that you had seen the
plates-you fool

  she bit her lip before she could answer
him he turned on me

  i dont care for your newspapers tell
your newspaper and tell brice and allison
that i laugh at them the police shall
arrest brice and allison if they annoy me
i am an american i have a lawyer who
will protect my interests brice and allison
are liars and crooks and that is all i have to
say

  at that he stalked out of the room and
slammed the door

  you must excuse him said mrs ain-
tree possession of those plates and the
responsibility have wrought on his nerves
he is hardly himself he is normally the
very essence of politeness but even moses
of the exodus you know used to fly into
a rage at times we who have spiritual
vision mr ramsden have more to bear
than other people and should be excused if
at times our tempers get the better of us


adventure

is he right in assuming that you represent
a newspaper

  no i said brice and allison inter-
ested me thats all

  i suppose that is the mr brice who
called on me in jerusalem along with a mr
grim i wondered at the time what their
real object was gulad tells me they have
been persecuting him for years he says
that brice managed to steal the most im-
portant of the plates did mr brice con-
fess to you that he has one of the plates in
his possession

  im not mr brices confessor i an-
swered you havent told me yet about
your plans

  you mean the agenda of the p o p
we have none in the usual meaning of the
word we will bring light to the colored
races and let the light do its own work
when you take two and multiply by two
you dont choose the result it becomes four
automatically when we teach what we
know to people who are as yet in darkness
the result is equally logical and takes care
of itself it is our business to sow the seed
the growth is sure to upset human calcula-
tions

  ive heard anarchists make statements
similar to that i said

  ah anarchists well they have the
courage of conviction but no knowledge
we have both moreover we have author-
ity in writing done thousands of years ago
by the man who gave the ten command-
ments to the israelites

  then you mean to upset the world if
you can i asked her

  do you deceive yourself that the world is
worth leaving as it is she retorted

  my impression is that you and your
friends are planning wholesale murder an-
archy rape ruin and misery simply for sake
of the power it may bring you personally
strange she said my intuition told
me you are capable of understanding-even
of being one of us but we sometimes make
mistakes youve nothing to do with the
police well mr ramsden let me give
you some advice for your own sake let
this matter drop dont try to interfere
with us you would find yourself up against
a knowledge-a power-a force that you are
incapable of understanding you will be
ground to powder and now i have im-
portant work to do and must bid you good
evening

  we shook hands and i laughed and went
but she did not laugh in the mirrors i
could see her scowling at my back

chapter v

oh you promis lanl

great men and women have great
vision but can keep their two feet on
the ground frogs who would be oxen let
their vision carry them away into realms of
sheer absurdity where all sense of propor-
tion vanishes

  i dont doubt mrs aintree had tremen-
dous vision i dont doubt she thought she
was entirely right she fondly imagined
gulad was a man of destiny sent to help
her by the powers that be whereas he was
an obvious character using her for his own
purposes the worst of it is that the
visionaries seem able to do more harm in
twenty minutes than the other fellows
can accomplish good in twenty years

  i had seen and heard enough to convince
me that mrs aintree was contemplating
not much less than revolution under the
thin veneer of religion

  so i pulled meldrum strange out of bed
at his hotel and thrashed the problem out
with him from the beginning finally
we sent for brice and allison at midnight
and they agreed to place the whole investi-
gation in our hands but allison was so
anxious over his loss of the plates that he
made me the strangest proposal i ever
listened to

  man he said yell be honest as long
as it pays deevidends i havent a doubt
of it im a poor man but ill mak it
profitable for ye to be honest in the
course o cir-r-cumstances if yeve any
skill in following clues the r-rascals whove
stolen those plates away will be offering
ye money to corrupt ye-more by a verra
great deal than i could pay ye but i
take it yere a reasonable man ye talk
like one who has a fair pride yell keep a
fair bar-r-gain so if yell turn down any
offer o cor-r-uption ill give ye the half o
my savings just to encourage ye ye
shall have an auditors cer-r-tificate and
the half of all ive got it isnt much im
warning ye but honest money will feel bet-
ter in yr pur-r-se than a lar-r-ger sum
gotten by standing in wi gulad and his
like
moses and mrs aintree



   i hardly knew whether to laugh or swear
at him and ended by doing both he
would have been far more satisfied if i
had agreed to take his money the next
thing the dour old faithful did was to hire
another detective agency to keep an
eye on me their man came to me
perfectly frankly that afternoon and to
save trouble i promised to write out a
daily report of my doings and mail it to
his firm

isiili when evening came and aloysius
jackson put in his appearance i
took a taxi to the corner of fifty-
ninth and ninth where aloysius pointed
out a narrow door in a red brick building
less than half a block away there were
stores on either side of the front entrance
but the four upper stories were all shut-
tered and there was nothing to show what
use was made of them except for the three
letters pop done roughly in white paint
on the left-hand side of the dim hallway
where one cobwebby light burned over-
head but the wooden stair-treads showed
the marks of countless heavy feet and
the recently varnished handrail was al-
ready beginning to show fresh signs of
wear

   i made aloysius go up first and followed
him as a precaution against surprize but
there was nobody up there yet the echo
of our footsteps died away as we rested
at last in front of a door on which some
former employees of a tailoring concern
had scrawled their opinion of the boss to-
gether with an alleged portrait of the
gentleman

   that air gallery is inside here misto
ramsden sah got no key sah

 he felt less afraid of me at the moment
than of the dusky brethren who might call
him to account for admitting me you
all might bus that ole door in he sug-
gested trembling

  open her up i said or-

  a look at my fist convinced him he
pulled out his clasp-knife inserted the big
blade cleverly forced back the catch and
stood aside to let me pass through on to a
narrow gallery that extended the whole
length of one end of a room about sixty
feet by thirty the walls were white-
washed the windows shuttered and the
only light came down from a dusty factory
skylight that reflected the glare from an

electric advertisement on a neighboring
roof the floor of the room below was
arranged to seat about a hundred people
on inexpensive folding chairs and at the
end opposite to the gallery was a small
platform covered with red carpet against
which along one side stood a piano that
had decidedly seen better days

  there was a pile of reserve chairs stacked
against the gallery railing near one end
so i spread those out a little cautioned
aloysius jackson and shut myself in
the only entertainment during the hour
that followed was provided by a rat whom
curiosity devoured but who stubbornly
refused to make friends because i had no
food to offer him except tobacco

  then came the sound of voices foot-
steps on the stairs below a snatch of song
and the jingle of keys followed by aloysius
jackson opening the door to search the gal-
lery for strangers the lights in the hall
were switched on suddenly and the fear
on jacksons face was something to marvel
at he shut the door behind him walked
the length of the gallery noisily to call at-
tention to the fact that he was doing his
duty cautioned me with a finger raised to
his lips and let himself out again slam-
ming the door with a noise like a thunder-
clap a minute later i heard him reporting
to somebody below that the gallery was
empty

  the hall began to fill rapidly with col-
ored men and one of them went to the
piano beginning to play all the latest
ragtime airs with that peculiar careless ease
that no white man ever seems able to imi-
tate successfully some of them pushed
chairs out of the way and began to dance
and when a dozen colored women entered
the place was in an uproar for several
minutes it was about as little like a
religious meeting as a bicycle resembles
camembert cheese

  the initiates began to arrive after a
while and sat on the platform in a row with
their backs against the wall all dressed
alike in well-tailored black suits aloysius
jackson who seemed to be acting janitor
for the day shuffled about arranging chairs
glancing up in my direction every now
and then through the interstices of the
stacked-up chairs i counted nine initiates
running the gamut of shades between black
and ivory they wpre a self-satisfied
well-fed smug-looking lot


adventure

the ragtime continued almost
until the moment when mrs ain-
ijjpj -ree walked up the aisle in evening
dress with orchids on her bosom followed
by gulad-moses then the tune changed
and everybody stood up bursting into song-

   if theres a devil and its true true true
   whod rob the devil of his due due due-

  it stopped when she reached the plat-
form there she stood facing them with
one hand raised her back to the initiates
and gulad stood half a pace behind her
the utter silence in which the congregation
waited for her to speak was fair evidence
of her hold over them they didnt even
shift their feet or glance about you could
hear the long gasp as one or another grew
tired of holding his breath

  friends she began after a full minute
and then paused she knew the full value
of keeping them waiting i am glad to
see so many of you here this evening
has the gallery been searched

  from the back of the hall aloysius
jackson answered that it had been his
voice quavering

  who is that she demanded you
aloysius you searched very well i
want to emphasize the need of always doing
that -we can not be too careful anyone
might lurk up there and overhear things
that must not be made public for the
present

  no general commanding ever addressed
his staff with more aplomb than she dis-
played her voice rang with emphasis
and her attitude was one of absolute com-
mand

  we will have only one hymn tonight
she went on and we will leave that for the
end of the meeting there have been
complaints about the noise we make and
the sooner we get our own hall where we
can follow inspiration without restraint the
better let there be more whole-hearted-
ness let me see you give more generously
-fewer dimes and quarters and many
more dollar bills show by your generosity
in giving to our cause-that your claim to
be entitled to self-determination is not
nonsense as your critics say it is let the
key-note of your loyalty be give-give
more-give magnificently

  i did not dare move to look around but
it struck me that her speech was falling
flat the initiates behind her who pre-

sumably drew salaries to pay for their fine
clothes beamed approval but i heard no
murmur from the congregation signifying
eagerness to pour cash into the coffers
she sensed the backwardness for she
changed her tone

  why am i your leader because in no
other way can you enter your promised
land and come into your god-given rights
remember the children of israel before
they were able to spoil the egyptians they
had to obey their leader and give all their
gold and silver to the common fund it
was after they had done that not before
that their leader showed them how to ap-
propriate the wealth of their taskmasters
and then led them through the wilderness
into a land flowing with milk and honey

  that suited them better there began
to be a little restlessness talk about
plunder just over the skyline was more
agreeable than demands for cash down

  perhaps you are bewildered she went
on perhaps your courage fails when you
think of the power of the people who op-
press you who grow richer every day from
your starved and unappreciated efforts
but the children of israel labored under the
whip to make bricks without straw and they
broke the yoke how by concerted
effort in obedience to their divinely chosen
leader remember that we have the
precise instructions of that identical leader
engraved on gold and buried away in the
sands of egypt until at the appointed time
your new moses rediscovered them

  at that reference to himself gulad did
not actually pat himself on the back or
make any specific gesture nor did he smile
broadly or say anything but he came out
of a mood of meditative discontent into the
broad sunshine of complacency like a but-
terfly emerging from a chrysalis and i
could almost feel his self-esteem physically
from where i crouched

  perhaps you feel discouraged by the
thought that all your promised land is
occupied by alien peoples mrs aintree
went on i answer you remember the
children of israel they were four hundred
years in bondage it was often their fate
as yours has been to be carried away into
captivity but they returned laden with
the spoils of their captors

  they applauded that part of her speech
clapping and stamping their feet the noise
increasing until one big buck in the middle
moses and mrs aintree



of the hall bawled out

  oh you promis lan oh you lil land
o milk an honey wes on our way

  she held her hand up and silence fell as
if she had touched the button that con-
trolled them

  it may seem an insuperable obstacle
to you she continued that that vast
continent of africa-your native land-
your birthright-is all staked out by
european powers whose trespass is upheld
by armed men and artillery but remem-
ber again the children of israel they
marched into a land that also was occupied
by trespassing nations whose military
power was considered overwhelming in
that day and what happened the
lord fought for the children of israel and
the trespassers were put to the sword and
driven out in confusion the lord will
fight for you if you obey your leader and
respect this new moses

the new moses preened himself
again but she did not step aside
to let him make a speech and i
began to get the hang of the situation
there was rivalry between her and gulad
he had the gold plates she had the con-
gregation and the gift of speech they
had tried to combine in partnership but
were as jealous of each other as a pair of
rival politicians i think it crossed his
mind to step forward and begin to say
something but she forestalled him with
a contralto voice that rang down the hall
magnificently

  you are known as the people of pisgah
why because you have vision because
you can rise to the heights of inspiration
and discern the destiny in store for you-
destiny that depends on strict obedience
you are more fortunate than the children
of israel-for many reasons-in many
ways

  oh you promis lan you promis lan
you milk an honey we is on our way
you have their example you have
the record of mistakes they made you
can judge how they failed and suffered when
they disobeyed but when they were
utterly obedient how they surged on to
one success after another becoming pos-
sessed because they were obedient of all
the wealth of their enemies on those
terms will you obey or not

  that got them the hall broke into

tumult they were willing to promise
anything on terms of quid pro quo and
their enthusiasm broke bounds until she
once more raised her hand this time she
had more difficulty in getting them to be
quiet and it was two or three minutes
before she could make her voice heard
then she struck the vein of promises again

  you are more fortunate than the chil-
dren of israel they had a land of milk
and honey to go to but it was a little land
with limitations surrounded on every side
by enemies you have a whole vast
continent surrounded by the sea the sea
that surrounds africa will protect you
they had a waterless desert to traverse
and it took them forty years for you
there is only a friendly sea that can be
crossed in fourteen days or less they
had to enter a land that was full from end to
end of enemies for you there waits a
continent where millions of your own race
will receive you with open arms-with
tumults of rejoicing they will make com-
mon cause with you to drive the tyrants
from your coasts

  that set pandemonium loose some of
them began singing i caught fragments
of three different hymns from opposite
ends of the room and one bull throat
drowned out all the others roaring-

oh youve got to be a lover of the lord of the
    lord

  if you want to go to heaven when you die-

  the man at the piano struck a chord
and in a moment they were on their feet
but she stilled them with a gesture of mag-
nificent command a weaker woman a
less clever one in her own way would have
let them shout themselves hoarse and sing
themselves into hysteria but she chose
to show authority and check them in the
same sort of way that a skilful driver con-
trols his horses after giving them their
heads for half-a-minute there was light-
ning in her eyes and regal power in her ges-
ture they grew still

  you are more fortunate than the chil-
dren of israel they walked they had to
content themselves with such trifles as were
considered wealth in those days they drew
on the resources of egypt in a hurry taking
what could be obtained to balance their
account with the egyptians who were
poverty-stricken compared with your op-
pressors you are in no hurry you


adventure

have the wealth of a continent to draw on
such as neither babylon or rome could
show in their palmiest days is obedience
a too great price to pay for that advantage
then came the gist of her address-the
rhubarb in the sugar-coated pill-the point
that made gulad blink and swallow taking
all the gilt off the ginger-snap of being the
new moses

  obey me she thundered and your
continent-your promised land-is yours
obey her not gulad

well they promised her they
rose like one man to their feet
and filled that hall with a din sur-
passing the dust-laden tumult of political
conventions it was no wonder that com-
plaints had been received about the noise
the pianist cut loose like one man playing
a duet but made no impression on the din
i could see his hands moving and his figure
swaying but heard no note of the music
and the dry dust rising off the floor and
swaying in clouds about the hanging
electric lights made me cough until the
tears came but i was perfectly safe up
there they were much too excited to hear
me

  it must have been fifteen minutes before
order was restored there were individ-
uals who had to be forcibly suppressed
one man upset half-a-dozen chairs and
danced until their occupants fell on him and
forced him to the floor where he lay under
the lot screaming with idiotic laughter
and through it all mrs aintree stood smiling
patronizingly every now and then turning
to say a word to gulad who sulked and
said nothing when more r less silence
fell at last i thought she was going to bring
gulad forward and let him say something
but not a bit of it

  it does my heart good she said to
see you so enthusiastic in a righteous
cause-so enjoying your clear vision of
success but dont forget that from your
pisgah height you see the promised land
without the miles that lie between there
are difficulties to be overcome that lie in
wait for you difficulties not surmountable
except by patience and persistence we
need courage pertinacity and secrecy
combined courage that will throw off
tyranny pertinacity that shall not flinch
or falter when your tyrants bring about
delay in order to keep you a while longer

in thrall to them secrecy that shall con-
found the enemy by keeping him in the
dark as to our plans dare all things
persevere in the face of delay say nothing
tell nobody these are my injunctions
to you

  she paused to let another outburst of
enthusiasm have a full two minutes lease
before continuing with the self-satisfaction
of the demagogue who feels the crowd
helpless under hand

  and why this secrecy are we afraid
not we but if you warn the egyptians
in advance your chance will be gone we
have work to do before we make our exodus
our missionaries must go out to africa
and prepare our friends yonder for what
is coming we must raise funds we
must teach our propaganda must ex-
tend to the towns and hamlets not only of
new york and west virginia but of all
the united states and canada and south
america as well

  most of you are destined to be mission-
aries as porters as hotel servants as
laborers-in all the menial capacities to
which your tyrants have reduced you-
you will go forth and sow the seed working
whenever opportunity presents itself and
since every laborer is worthy of his hire
your expenses will be paid from the contri-
butions to our cause that you yourselves
take up the half of every dollar that you
take you keep the other half you forward
to headquarters where it will be used to
swell the general fund there will be no
auditing no check on you we people of
pisgah must learn to trust one another
before we can expect to have an empire at
our feet

  that sentiment struck home neither
south sea bubble nor blue sky mining
stock ever looked better to investors than
that proposal to share and share alike in
all the voluntary contributions without
audit the few faces that i could see took
on an expression of hopeful avarice that
would have passed muster in the zoo at
mealtime and the initiates on the row of
chairs at the rear of the platform beamed
almost drunkenly

  and now she said we have made
almost noise enough in this neighborhood
for one night it is our usual course to
conclude these meetings with prayer suit-
able to the occasion but there is a stipula-
tion in the lease that we must be out of this
moses and mrs aintree



hall by ten oclock and i shall have to trust
you to say your prayers at home on this
occasion we will conclude our meeting
with your favorite hymn that i wrote spe-
cially for you and that i think most of you
know by heart during the course of the
hymn our initiates will pass among you and
take up a collection and at the conclusion
i will ask you to pass out of the hall quietly
and disperse calling as little attention to
yourselves as possible

  the man at the piano struck up they
rose to their feet excitedly and burst into
the song i had heard earlier in the evening

if theres a devil and its true true true

whod rob the devil of his due due due

in the dark the devils lurking

for our downfall ever working

but well laugh to see his finish in his own bad
     brew

let the devil wear the shackles that he forged-
     so-well

ours shall be the kernel his the emp-ty shell

for the lord the earth is ridding
of the fools who did his bidding

and theyll tumble with the devil into hell-
    hell-hell

i didnt stay to hear any more
but took my chance of opening
the gallery door unseen and slipping
out nevertheless i was seen from the
platform or at any rate the door was
seen to move four big black men
came out of the door below and inter-
cepted me demanding insolently what i
wanted

  is this where the k of p meetings are
held i asked

  caint yo read demanded one of
them dont it say pop down thah
on that wall

  what was you doin asked another
one crowding me close he may have got
his muscle heaving coal and he seemed
rather to relish the prospect of a scuffle
with a white man its fortunate that
colored men have good thick skulls or
there would have been a case for the coroner
one made the gross mistake of getting be-
tween me and the stairs to bar my way and
as his jaw was thrust out quarrelsomely i
hit that first he went over backwards
and crashed downstairs on his head and
shoulders before the other three could
razor in and i took the stairway at a run-
ning jump landing on my victim as i passed
taking out of him any wind that might

 have remained and surely delaying pursuit
 because he lay across the stairs and they had
 to feel their way over him in semi-darkness

   once outside there was no further danger
 men whom meldrum strange had sent
 came on the run the minute i showed my-
 self they were most of them colored men
 who had worked for banks and suchlike
 institutions but two were white

   i ordered the colored men to shadow
 the initiates the white mens job was to
 watch mrs aintree and her accomplice
 gulad not interfering with them but in-
 stantly reporting the first sign of any con-
 templated move

   then i phoned meldrum strange and set
 off in a hurryto find terence casey for
 i wanted his advice but hurry did not
 help me much that boast of his that i
 would know where to get in touch with him
 at any time was easy to say offhandedly
 but not demonstrable i chased him from
 pillar to post by phone messenger taxi-
 cab and on foot being sent on from one
 place to another by eecret-service men
 every one of whom had seen him that even-
 ing because he had been the rounds and
 given them instructions for what they said
 was an important case

   and i found him at last near midnight
 in a little back room over a place that had
 once been a saloon pulling off his socks
 preparatory to getting into bed with his
 shirt and trousers on there was a tele-
 phone beside the bed and i guess he used
 that place habitually

    well he said smiling as an old woman
 ushered me into the room hows the

	new case coming have ye cut yr eye-
 teeth yet

    i told you it was a case for the police
 i answered and it is

   sit ye down on the bed ramsden me
 boy and unburden the sorrows av yr
 soul tell me all about it

   i repeated to him word for word all that
 i could remember of mrs aintrees speech
 and added my own comments

   - said casey when i had finished

 go home and sleep unless ye want to
 share this bed with me thats nothing
 ye should have heard the devils talk in
 butte around the mining camps shes
 just a hot-air expert out for exercise and
 small change you go home to bed me
 boy and dream about yr fee yell get from
 brice and allison

chapter vi

no form of abstinence no fasts no saintsdays

jvteldrum strange tried to inter-
lva est the attorney generals depart-
ment but without success terence caseys
secret report on the subject was a deciding
factor he denied to me having sent in any
such report but with a smile in his eye

  yere like all amatchoor daytectives
ramsden me boy ye think that yr case
is a lallapolooser and all the departments
are banded together wi red tape to keep ye
from savin the body politic yeve been
reading sherlock holmes-good reading
too i dont blame ye but im busy go
an tend to yr case an dont worry me
when yere weary of such foolishness go
back to huntin iliphints-a game ye un-
derstand

  but we didnt have to be guided by politi-
cal considerations or by the barometric
state of someones bile in washington d c
we put our whole force on the problem
regardless of expense jeremy wrote from
london that two white missionaries and a
number of colored ones were actively
preaching similar doctrines to mrs ain-
trees in the london slums and other places
where the floating colored population could
be found and grim wrote from egypt to
much the same effect adding that the story
of the gold plates had spread southward into
the sudan and was causing the administra-
tion no small concern moses being regard-
ed as a mighty prophet by christian and
mohammedan alike the colored mission-
aries were finding no difficulty in spreading
their new doctrine which found readier
acceptance because it included the ex-
pulsion of all the white races from africa
forever grim wrote

  the thing looks bad and is growing worse the
natives are getting cockier than ever and less in-
clined to reason the story of those gold plates
has gone to their heads theyre beginning to talk
already about reversing the position and subjecting
the white races to their dark authority

  the mystery is where all the money comes from
to finance these missionaries none of them do any
work ive traced a small part of their funds to
random subscriptions taken up locally but there
seems to be a central fund that baffles discovery
the money being spent out here greatly exceeds the
receipts from donations so its obvious someone is
paying the piper these missionaries out here live
like fighting cocks and are growing arrogant

  one thing that makes their propaganda easy is
that they preach no form of abstinence no fasts
no saints days no ramadan with its forty days

of thirst and hunger the conventional moralities
are all scofied at a man according to their doc-
trine may have as many wives as he can support or
can be induced to support him they object to too
much prayer and tcach that a mans instincts are
his own best guide you can imagine how such a doc-
trine as that will draw adherents from all quarters

  theres some one in authority when a mis-
sionary gets orders to go elsewhere he goes and
another takes his place they teach absolutely
strict obedience and keep the source of the orders a
mystery but theres a man who calls himself moses
who gets cables in code from new york ive
managed to get copies of some of the cables but
cant puzzle out the code because i cant discover
what book the numbers refer to

  this is all too ably thought out and organized to
be the work of mrs aintree that woman is only
half-clever i believe jyou will find that theres
some much abler man or woman behind her who
uses her for a stalking horse to hide his or her own
identity whoever it is certainly displays a knowl-
edge of the native races far beyond the ordinary as
well as an understanding of crowd-psychology in
general

  if you examine mrs aintrees antecedents you
may discover from whom she got her ideas theyre
distinctly second-hand and my advice is the same
old stuff i was always rubbing into you when we
hunted together in arab country get close be
patient stay on the job until you force a show-
down appear to give the enemy a free hand and
stop look listen watch out you dont get
murdered mrs aintree i think would draw the
line at murder personally but not impersonally
i know her sort they preach and some fanatic does
the killing as happened in the case of lincoln and
mckinley and lots of others i could mention

  above all dont be discouraged by official cold
water and what may look like official impediments
placed in your way dont talk or consult au-
thorities root right in until youve found the
individual whos really running things and then go
for him bald-headed yours for peace without
perquisites-grim

  as a matter of fact we had already fol-
lowed in most respects the line grim recom-
mended for instance we had looked up
mrs aintrees past and nothing could af-
ford better proof of grims almost uncanny
judgment than the result of our inquiries
she had been connected with a school of
esoteric thought conducted in boston
massachusetts by an east indian named
pananda whose teachings had had con-
siderable vogue until mrs aintree who
seems to have been his favorite pupil led
a revolt against him and tried to set up a
school of her own in opposition

i made a trip to boston and
called on this man pananda he
was living in style in a house in the
fenway had a chinese butler and kept
me waiting in an extravagantly furnished
moses and mrs aintree



anteroom for three quarters of an hour as if
he were an up-to-date physician with a fash-
ionable practise i might have been more
impressed by his importance if there had 
been anybody else on the waiting list or if
i hadnt been curious enough to look about
me there was a peculiar arrangement of
mirrors in the room that brought to mind
the somewhat similar arrangement in mrs
aintrees apartment so i sat still and ex- 
amined them going about it as carefully as
if i knew i were being watched

  mirrors are mighty puzzling things un-
less you are accustomed to manipulating
them if you dont believe that just ar-
range a piece of paper so that you can see
it in a mirror and without looking at the
paper but observing its reflection in the
glass try to draw a square and then to cross
the square with diagonal lines it was quite
a long time before i had figured out that
those mirrors were so arranged that a per-
son looking into one of them from one angle
would get a full view of anyone who hap-
pened to be in the room

  it wasnt so difficult after that to discover
that the point from which the view was to
be had was in the middle of the wall above
where i was sitting so that i had my back
to the view-point and face toward the light

i chose another chair and examined that
wall there were two mirrors draped with
magnificent eastern hangings and between
them a thing shaped like a persian shield
only instead of being solid it was pierced
to form an intricate pattern anyone could
see easily through its interstices provided
there were a corresponding hole in the wall
behind it but he would have to be standing
on a support of some kind because the lower
edge of the shield was more than six feet
from the floor i returned to the first chair
and set my foot on it with the idea of ex-
amining the shield more closely and it was
exactly at that instant that the chinese
butler opened the door to announce that
swami pananda would see me he saw my
foot on the chair but made no comment

  i was ushered into a large square room
hung like the first with eastern draperies
but containing very little other furniture
a magnificent carpet covered the entire
floor and at one end of the room were a
short couch and an armchair made of teak
against the wall on my left at a point that
corresponded with the persian shield in the
anteroom was a gilded image of the bhudda

an enormous thing more than eight feet
high and the large plate-glass windows
opposite suffused it with light making it the
one outstanding object in the room the
whole effect was sumptuous yet magnifi-
cently simple and produced a far from dis-
agreeable impression

  pananda was seated on the couch and
rose to meet me he was a rather fat man
but not flabby dressed in semi-indian
clothes of yellow silk-a sort of comfortable
compromise between the easiness of india
and western notions about decorum he
wore yellow silk socks and yellow soft
morocco-leather slippers but no jewelry
whatever for the rest he was a mild-look-
ing person with remarkable brown eyes
a rather bulging broad forehead half-con-
cealed under a yellow silk turban and a
smile that was winning to say the least of it

  welcome mr ramsden pray take
that easy chair so you came to talk to
me but i shall do most of the talking if you
permit you saw through my little device
for analyzing visitors my chinese butler
interrupted your investigation its part of
his business to keep an eye on strangers
youd be interested i daresay to see how
the arrangement works the head of the
buddha swings outward on a hinge-look

  he got off the couch and showed me
pressing a very simple spring catch behind
the buddhas ear the whole head swung
forward like the leaf of a door disclosing
the rear of the persian shield through a
small hole in the wall

  you see by standing on the buddhas
lap i can observe anyone in the next room
from every angle i often have a lot of
quiet amusement watching visitors un-
known to themselves the longer i keep
them waiting the more completely they
give themselves away as a general rule
then they come in here and tell me silly
little lies about themselves and other people
i introduce themselves to themselves for
the first time usually they go away aston-
ished sometimes i charge them a big fee
sometimes not depending on the circum-
stances i shall not charge you anything
for instance

  i had no intention of paying you a fee
i answered

  i know you hadnt you came here to
investigate me my brother youre a very
easy man to read rather honest but not
nearly as honest as you think you are


adventure

a hunter-you have done a lot of killing in
your time a resolute man and a very faith-
ful friend-those are your two strong points
not quarrelsome but combative-too will-
ing to settle any argument by strength and
brute force you are one of the strongest
men physically and even in some ways men-
tally whom i have met in recent years as
for your present purpose-you came to talk
to me about mrs aintree am i right
how did you know that i demanded
oh thats very simple i notice youre
not a policeman you have none of the ear-
marks of the hired investigator and i con-
fess that puzzled me for a while but i put
two and two together you know thats my
business and im an old hand at it look
at this

i read the words isobel aintree
in a bold thick handwriting at the
foot of a letter that he pulled out of
his pocket

  isobel aintree is disturbed he ex-
plained shes beginning to be sorry that
she left my fold-i give lessons you know
she called me on long-distance and i went
to see her in that apartment she has leased
in new york she wanted advice ha-ha
they all come back to their teacher in the
end she told me something of her great
plans and begged me to tell her how to
manage an individual named gulad who
seems to be giving her a lot of trouble i
interviewed this gulad and he was very
angry with her for having summoned me
he accused her of talking too much and
gave me to understand that she had been
especially indiscreet toward a man whose
name he didnt mention but who he said
came to see her one evening that man was
obviously yourself

  he eyed me humorously as if he expected
me to see the connection and enjoy the joke
but i didnt

  i recognized you at once he said she
learned that arrangement of mirrors in a
room from me when you sat down in my
anteroom i noticed that you recognized the
same arrangement i had quite a little fun
observing how long you took to puzzle out
the sequence of reflections from mirror to
mirror gulad had described to me an in-
dividual fairly well answering your descrip-
tion i have in my pocket a letter from mrs
aintree in which she complains that some
agency in no way connected with the police

is-to use her eloquent description-camp-
ing on her trail she states that all her
former friends have been cross-questioned
and her whole past has been inquired into
and begs me to answer no questions in case
that anyone should apply to me when my
butler brought your card i added all that
together and the total amounted to mr
jeff ramsden here to ask questions about
mrs aintree not very clever was i
after all

  do you intend to answer my questions
i asked him

  certainly why not and now you
are wondering just how much credence you
can place in my answers hah my friend
if you had studied people as scientifically as
i have you would never wonder at my being
able to read your thought in that way
your emotions flit over your face one after
another like the pictures on a screen mr
ramsden well as your expression sug-
gested a moment ago i am something of a
mountebank it is true but a rather more
than usually honest one i used to be an
altruist as i- thought pure and simple but
have awakened since to consciousness of a
vein of absurdity underlying all my efforts
to improve the human race

  my diligent and more promising pupils
mostly deserted me in a half-taught condi-
tion as mrs aintree did for instance and
set up in opposition sometimes even going
so far as to denounce me as an impostor
the stupid pupils simply wouldnt learn
and what they did learn often disagreed
with them so i have been gradually dis-
continuing to teach and devote myself
nowadays more to giving advice to folk in
difficulties sometimes for a fee and some-
times gratuitously i make the rich ones
pay believe me to that extent i am a
mountebank i frequently charge for per-
forming tricks as simple as the one i played
on you just now on the other hand i be-
lieve i do no harm in the world and i know
i have frequently done good

  no harm in the world i retorted
you admit that you taught that aintree
woman and then turned her loose to-

  pardon me my friend i did not turn
her loose she left me in peculiarly irritat-
ing circumstances and not only set up an
opposition class of her own but told lies
about me she accused me of immoralities
and i dont know what else however i
bear no malice malice my friend poisons
moses and mrs aintree

 

whoever entertains it rather than the
one against whom it is supposedly directed
and one of the first lessons i teach is the
absurdity of harboring malice

  when she sent for me the other day i
went at once and i gave her some very
good advice it was so good and so dis-
agreeable that she did not offer to pay my
expenses to new york and back-not that
i would have accepted the money- but she
did not know that i would not accept
one of my first principles is never to accept
money from anyone whom i have not helped
or am unable to help there is no helping
her in her present mood she is headed
toward disaster

  you might save a lot of trouble for other
people suggested by helping to speed her
disaster before she involves too many in it
i would hardly do that he answered
good does not come out of evil although
the opposite argument looks plausible at
times the confidences of my pupils or of
people in distress who come to me for ad-
vice are absolutely sacred it must be ob-
vious that i could not conduct my activities
on any other basis i would go to prison
before i would violate a confidence but
a pupil who is disloyal and who uses my
teachings corruptly as mrs aintree for
instance does forfeits in a degree the right
to be treated in that manner in a degree
please understand me only in a degree
you said you would answer my ques-
tions about her

  i did but my answers will depend upon
the questions i did not tell you in what
way i will answer them suppose you try
me with a sample question to begin with
very well i said who is coaching
mrs aintree it isnt gulad for hes a
rather ordinary smart-aleck and the scope
is much too vast for any woman of her
caliber who is directing her from behind
the scenes

 shrewd he remarked much too
shrewd for you in fact my friend ob-
viously she is not the only one who receives
coaching someone else suggested that
question to you am i right

  yes but who is coaching mrs aintree

it is no breach of confidence to
answer that he said meditatively
bhopal gosh-a hindu-more or
less a countryman of mine

  a teacher like you

  not at all like me but a teacher never-
theless he has also been known as the
true mahatma the golden guru the
buddha redivivus-and by some of his
american reporter critics as the perfect
piece of cheesfe he has other self-con-
ferred titles too many to remember i be-
lieve that in his heart to himself in private
he candidly admits that he is the wisest man
on earth he once had the effrontery to
make to me proposals that were laughable
i am not ambitious unless to bring a little
comfort into a distressed world and i gave
him what i believe was very good advice-
in this room he was sitting in that armchair
my advice enraged him he is an immense-
ly powerful man physically i should say
he is even more muscular than you are
he has a temper like a typhoon i had my
work cut out to escape from the interview
uninjured and before he left he swore to
make me sorry i had ever met him

  well mr ramsden i am not given to
regretting experiences they are the chief
part of our education but i knew that
that man would destroy me if he could it
was for me to prove that he could not de-
troy me he commenced a campaign
against me by propaganda which was less
difficult to deal with than if it had been
more subtle at that time he too was
conducting classes in boston charging pro-
digious fees and appealing in the main to
women which made it rather easy for him
to approach my women-pupils indirectly
and win some of them away from me

  mrs aintree was the first to go and she
took several others five of whom are still
with her she has subjected those five-to
her arrogant will by making believe to pos-
sess inspired knowledge that is really far
beyond her present power of attainment
she is a great play-actor i made the mis-
take of teaching her too much psychology
before her character was ready to digest
such dangerous knowledge and bhopal
gosh who is a man without any conscience
but with a rare ability proceeded to cram
her foolish head with much more of the
same sort so that she has become a creature
who is clever and foolish by fits and starts

  she mistrusts bhopal gosh because no
one can have intimate dealings with him
without discovering his crude dishonesty of
purpose but she respects his knowledge and
his adroitness to use the least objectionable
word that seems applicable and she is


adventure

certainly afraid of him he has taken good
care that she shall be afraid of him that
is his invariable method he has excited
her ambition and fed it and now he makes
her believe that with one stroke of the wand
so to speak he can throw her in the discard
and deprive her of all chance to attain the
influence over people that she yearns for

  why should she come to you for advice
if she thinks so highly of bhopal gosh
i asked

  because he has left her in new york
with rather more responsibility than she can
manage mere ambition mr ramsden
doesnt confer ability she has what freud
might call the emperor-complex she seeks
to dominate and knows enough to take the
first steps toward her goal but the first
steps are the easiest and the most deceptive
they lead to a stage of bewilderment which
she has reached and in that peculiar stage
of mind she sent for me to give her good
advice having so far lost her sense of right
and wrong under bhopal goshs tuition
that she actually believed i would help her
to consummate his evil purposes in his
absence she said that as my former pupil
she was entitled to advice from me well
so she is i gave her some but she is very
far from taking it

  where has bhopal gosh gone i asked
him

  that might be difficult to discover he
is one of those crafty individuals who
expects his victims to tell him all their se-
crets as a point of good faith between pupil
and teacher but who keeps his own counsel
perfectly he makes his preparations a
long while ahead the mere fact that he
has started on a journey let us say west-
ward is no proof that the east is not his
real objective he has made a tremendous
amount of money because some of his pu-
pils have been successful in business and
it has been easy for him to get inside knowl-
edge of stock exchange transactions one
of his pupils who afterwards went to prison
was in the confidence of one of the larg-
est brokers in boston so he is able to pay
for what he can not obtain in other ways

  do you suppose he has gone abroad

  possibly he started for west virginia
where this p o p society of mrs aintrees
had its beginnings if he has gone abroad
from there he probably applied for his
passport and booked his steamer passage
months ago

  i stared at pananda for more than a min-
ute

  and now you are wondering he said
whether it is jealousy of bhopal gosh that
makes me talk of him in this way and just
how far my information may be trusted

i hardly blame you every human being
is dishonest-with himself if not with other
people when we overcome dishonesty we
shall cease to be humans and become some-
thing better but i am doing my best for
you and that is very likely better than you
could get elsewhere on the particular sub-
ject of which we are talking i am not
jealous of bhopal gosh it would annoy
him intensely to know that i pity him yet
that is the fact however i pity a great
deal more the unfortunates who have been
inveigled under his control you may be-
lieve implicitly every word i have told you
about him

  i daresay you could tell me a great deal
more i suggested

  possibly i could tell you a great deal
more about some of his victims if that were
permissible but you see my position i
am already half a charlatan because i
descend to such tricks as that hole in the
wall behind the buddhas head i would be
wholly a charlatan if i betrayed confidences
made to me in good faith the truth of the
whole matter is that i am a lazy man ex-
tremely willing and in many cases able to
give comfort to others but fond of my own
comforts also you would like me to enter
the lists with you against bhopal gosh and
mrs aintree that thought has been 
hovering across your mind for several
minutes i shall disappoint you im
afraid

  ive got work out of lazier men than
you i answered

  i dont doubt it but you see they
werent clever men you cant get work
out of a clever man who doesnt wish to
work i am rather clever and besides i
have no wish to avenge myself on bhopal
gosh revenge is too costly altogether
and not worth while

  arent you interested in protecting
bhopal goshs victims i demanded he
and this aintree woman are planning to
throw the world into the devil of a mess

  my interest lies only in helping those
who actually come to me for help he an-
swered you came to me i have tried to
help you but my gifts are limited i can
moses and mrs aintree



give you advice but not material assist-
ance

  have you heard anything about some
stolen gold plates i demanded

  oh yes mrs aintree told me all about
them if you wish me to talk of them you
must tell me everything that you know
about them first then i shall be able
to determine how much i can say to
you without infraction of others confi-
dences

  so i told him beginning with brices
story and ending with an account of the
meetingat fifty-ninth and ninth new
york

  very interesting pananda exclaimed
at last most deeply interesting there
is very little that i can add to your informa-
tion but i can give you some good advice
those plates are comparatively speaking
harmless in the hands of the abyssinian
gulad or of mrs aintree because they both
lack the necessary brains to use them to the
full advantage but in the hands of bhopal
gosh-they would be worse than poison-
gas and dynamite combined if you can
prevent his getting them you will be render-
ing the world a service bhopal gosh is
possessed of devilish ingenuity he- knows
perfectly well how to excite mens passions
by an appeal to their religious instincts or
their superstition those plates would
better be destroyed than in the hands of
bhopal gosh

  what is he crazy for power

  he has power he is mischievous go
after bhopal gosh but take care for your-
self for he is more dangerous than all the
other dangerous men you have ever met
all put together

chapter vii

    murdered at seven fifteen

t left panandas house with mixed feel-
ings but on the whole felt inclined to
trust his information the difficulty to my
mind was to believe that here in the united
states one man-and he a foreigner-could
have the gall to plan the world-wide outrage
that was apparently intended

  nevertheless by the time i reached new
york next morning i was inclined to believe
in spite of what i have seen in various
quarters of the world in the way of lightning-
like adoption of a new idea by widely scat-

tered colored races that the whole thing
was a mares nest that the gold plate in-
cident was a simple case of theft that the
p o p was a harmless organization that
might keep out of mischief otherwise pos-
sibly turbulent individuals and that mrs
aintree was a simply ambitious crank who
would melt presently in the heat of her own
hot air

  but meldrum strange who was waiting
for me in the office stolidly chewing one
of his dark cigars threw another light on
things he showed me the collected and
typed-out reports of our men in the field
they were from all over the united states
and described secret meetings of the
p o p followed by local strikes violence
and trouble on a small scale generally
there had been a particularly bad local out-
break at appleton west virginia

  and this is the latest he said passing
me a longhand report from one of our new
york men it was too late to get into the
morning papers

  he looked delighted he was in his ele-
ment sitting there in the middle of the net
like a strong good-natured spider feeling
the threads of events vibrate to his touch
along with his deliberate altruism there is
a schoolboy passion for intrigue it was
rapidly coming to the point where a murder
to him produced the same sort of effect that
news of a necessary operation does on a
young surgeon he was almost audibly
chuckling and murder it was according
to our mans account

   mameluke gulad was murdered at  this morn-
ing in his room at rileys hotel on ninth avenue
by an unknown colored man who entered through
the fire-escape nothing in the bedroom was dis-
turbed but gulads jaw was nearly wrenched off
by the assailant who gagged him and then stabbed
with a broad-bladed knife no knife was found
but the wound under the ribs on the left side is
several inches long death must have been nearly
instantaneous the police have charge of the body

  our man phoned in at  said
strange i happened to be down here
early and the first thing i did was ter phone
to mrs aintree and tell her all about it
shell be round here before long unless im
much mistaken

  i began to tell him about pananda and
bhopal gosh but his surmise was accurate
enough mrs aintree sent her card in
before i was half-through and the two of us
received her in stranges private office


adventure

she was dressed up to kill in a
lavender creation with a hat that
would have looked too youthful on
a maiden of seventeen and breezed into the
office with that sort of unsolicited familiarity
that annoys you by its insincerity she
marched on strange with her hand held out
are you mr ross mr ramsden i
know already and i met mr grim in
palestine

  my name is strange he answered bow-
ing slightly

  strange are you the gentleman who
telephoned to say that gulad has been
killed pardon me but how like the pic-
tures of general grant you look

  be seated madam and tell me what you
want he answered

  are you connected with the police in any
way she asked trying to ignore his
bruskness

  no maam

  what is this firm there is no descrip-
tion on the door or in the telephone book
we do an international business

  how did you learn about gulads
death she asked

  one of our men was passing the place
and saw the assassin escape

  well she said you know something
about gulad or you wouldnt have tele-
phoned to me at once

  gulad stole thirty-one ancient gold
plates from an egyptian temple and
brought them to this country with your
connivance strange answered where
are the gold plates mrs aintree

  she hesitated and strange took a long
shot-took it deliberately as if he were
firing at a mark

  you may stand accused of having that
man murdered for the possession of those
gold plates he said this firm has been
commissioned to recover those plates for
their lawful owners if you know where
they are youd better say so

  i dont know where they are she an-
swered the pity of it is i dont know
she wrung her hands and seemed in-
clined to cry

  gulad would trust nobody with them
he lived in that little back bedroom in
rileys hotel-a very third-rate place
with all kinds of undesirable characters
frequenting it constantly and we begged
him to be careful with them and not leave
them in his room

  who besides yourself was sufficiently
interested to caution him strange inter-
rupted

  she hesitated palpably again it was my
turn to take a long shot

  was his name bhopal gosh i asked
how did you know she demanded
continue maam said strange
what happened to the plates

  i dont know i wish i did if i knew
where to lay my hands on them i would
dispute their ownership with anyone ive
consulted a lawyer we were quite within
our legal rights in keeping them but now
i dont know what to do youve no notion
how much depends on the possession of
those plates who has commissioned you
why dont you take the commission from
me instead ill pay you anything in reason
to get them back if you find them and
hand them over to anybody else youll be
robbing me-us

  what do you think gulad did with
them asked strange there was noth-
ing in his bedroom when the corpse was
found the man who escaped was carrying
no package you must have some idea
what might gulad have done with them
did he rent a strong-box

  i dont know he had a little money
and opened a bank account at the up-town
branch of the cotton and woollen national
bank i went there on my way here and
they wouldnt tell me anything

i signaled strange and walked
out leaving the two of them talking
a taxi took me to the cotton and
woollen national in less than five minutes
and i was admitted at once into the
managers office

  does a man named gulad rent a strong-
box here i asked he has been mur-
dered youd better seal the box up

  he took me down into the strong-room
and showed me an entry in the day-book
the box had been opened and its contents
removed that morning exactly three min-
utes after nine oclock a colored man
apparently a negro and giving his name as
simon borrow had arrived with a letter
signed by gulad authorizing him to open
the strong-box as a photograph of simon
borrow together with his signature was
attached to the letter the bank had had no
alternative borrow had gone away five
minutes later in the same taxi that brought
moses and mrs aintree



him leaving the strong-box empty the
bank detective had fortunately noted down
the taxis number and of course the bank
had kept the letter and photograph

  i studied the picture of simon borrow
carefully and was far from being convinced
of his negro origin he looked more like
a native of bengal it was the picture of a
heavy man in the prime of life with massive
shoulders an enormously thick neck and a
big round head broad forehead heavy jaw
a rather pug nose and a smile of supreme
self-satisfaction his eyes were large
heavy-lidded and cunning and there was a
scar underneath the right one the in-
dividual features were strong and not ill-
proportioned taken together they de-
picted an immeasurable guile contempt of
other peoples intelligence and ruthlessness

  the strong-room clerk told me that the
mans physical strength was prodigious
he had put the contents of the strong-box
into a leather valise and had carried it out
with one hand with less apparent effort than
most men would seem to exert if the bag
were empty although the weight had made
the bottom of the valise sag out of shape

  - id hate to be the cop who has to tackle
him said the clerk as he affixed the banks
seal to the empty strong-box

  the next step was to track down the taxi
in which simon borrow had driven away
and that presented no difficulties but be-
fore assigning a man to that job i tele-
phoned police headquarters they prom-
ised us facilities whatever those are and
my friend casey looked in in the course of
the morning to learn how to be a day-
tective as he expressed it he grew ribald
when i showed him our condensed reports
from all over the u s a

  me boy dye think the state depart-
ment hasnt ten times that much dope i
could go to washington and lay me hands
on evry word ye have there only much
better systematized but suppose ye let
me have a copy o that just for riference

r jm he was waiting for the copy to be
mf jj typed when brice and allison came
 in each flourishing a different news-
paper giving central news accounts of
gulads death allison looked heartbroken
and brice hardly any better both had
made their minds up that the gold plates
were lost forever and allison was in favor
of returning at once to england

  were discr-r-edited disgr-r-aced and
ruined men we found the most impor-r-
tant records in the whole world and let
them be stolen from us for pitys sake
lets have the decency to retir-r-e into well
merited obleevion

  rot i answered weve a better
chance than ever you have the most
important plate

  aye yeve said the word the key to
all the others-as useless as a barren cow
without the others-as useless as the lost
ones are wiout our key man man if i
only knew that the thief were a scholar o
par-r-ts id r-rather hed stolen the key too
than know that such invaluable witnesses
o history were rendered dumb by separ-r-
ation

  where do ideas come from i suppose if
you could tell me that you could answer all
the riddles of the universe i was satisfied
that simon borrow and bhopal gosh
were one and the same person and now
allison bemoaning his disaster provided
an idea that was like a beacon on a dark
night

  weve hardly started our investigation
yet i said if i assure you that ive
confidence in being able to recover those
plates will you stay and lend a hand

  yes said brice instantly certainly
yes

  man yere daft said allison with
withering scorn yed heap a ruinous ex-
pense on what is much too bad already
well gang hame to obleevion

  i happen to be the senior member of this
commission brice retorted quietly well
stay

  allison yielded without another word
brice understood him pretty thoroughly
for the two had worked together in desert
places and there is no better way to get a
true line on your partner having made his
protest as a matter of principle allison was
only too glad to concede the point i then
propounded mine

  the man who has taken those plates
i said will be as quick as anyone to recog-
nize the value of the key to them he has
committed a murder hell have to stay
in hiding as long as the police hue and cry
lasts he wont dare try to go aboard ship
for thats the surest way of getting caught
hes a cunning devil the only way to
catch him is to let him know that the one
key-plate that completes the set and makes


adventure

translation of the whole lot possible is in
the united states hell try to get hold of
it in that way well get hold of him

  ye mean well use the one we have to
bait a mouse-trap with asked allison
something like that

  whats your plan then brice de-
manded

  the murder was committed and those
plates were stolen i said by a man
named bhopal gosh a bengali who has all
along in secret been the guiding hand be-
hind this p o p he is likely to have
half-a-dozen different alibis hes a
thoughtful rascal who leaves nothing to
chance but takes swift advantage of other
peoples carelessness weve got to appear
to be careless weve got to parade that
plate around the country in such a manner
that hell get to hear of it and the best way
we can do that i believe is tomo it in con-
nection with the p o p

  yed have a lot of black men juggling
with it allison demanded shocked

  id have a lot of black men discussing
it i answered i propose that we join
the p o p

  ye mean yed take part in their heathen-
ish abominations yed have us show our
plate and let those black men wor-r-ship it
ill lend idolatry no countenance on any
ter-r-ms at all snapped allison the
p o p is a weekid schism

  ill join anything if we can get those
plates back brice said quietly

  yell join then bang goes my last
atom o respect for yel exclaimed allison
yell join oh verra well i recognize
the adamantine nature o yr wilfulness ill
have to join along wi ye but lord whod
ha thought wed come to this

  that being settled i went into the next
office to talk the proposal over with strange
he already had particulars about the taxi
the driver reported having driven a full-
sized colored man from the cotton and
woollen national bank as far as the wash-
ington square arch where his fare got out
and mounted an up-town omnibus that
occurring to him as peculiar he had followed
he omnibus back for several blocks out of
idle curiosity and recalled its number but
that got us nowhere a passenger with a
valise can disappear from the top of an
omnibus at any point he pleased along
fifth avenue without exciting comment
later when i questioned the conductor he

didnt as much as remember having carried
him

chapter viii

he likes notes of rather large denominations

events began to follow now in swift
succession the first was a conference
at police headquarters by police request
in the course of which strange and i told
the whole story as far as we knew its de-
tails the police had grilled mrs aintree
thoroughly but got small change out of her
since seeing strange and me in the office she
had executed a complete volte face-denied
knowing much about gulad beyond that
he returned with her party from palestine-
denied ever having seen any gold plates al-
though she admitted knowing that gulad
had imported something of the sort-
had no knowledge of any one who would be
likely to murder gulad for the sake of the
gold plates but had her suspicions of a cer-
tain mr brice who gulad had said was
capable of anything and who for all she
knew might be in new york-and was
generally speaking indignant as well as
carefully vague

  she gave the police permission to search
her apartment which they promptly did
but found nothing incriminating

  the police knew nothing about bhopal
gosh until i mentioned his name and then
knew no more of him than i did how-
ever within five minutes after that we had
settled on a plan of action

  i went straight to mrs aintrees apart-
ment where in addition to one of our men
in the uniform of a hall-porter therewas a
pretty obvious plain-clothes policeman on
duty in the vestibule she sent out word
that she was indisposed but i answered
that she could choose between interviewing
me or the police and she decided to see me
alone in the room with the mirrors she
was black-angry the creases in her fore-
head resembled a devils finger-marks and
her wonderful blue eyes were alight with
what i analyzed as treachery if ever a
man or woman stood ready to throw over a
whole cause to save herself that one was
she-or so i read the situation

have you seen the police i asked her

  they have seen me i was never more
insulted in my life she answered

  they tell me that you deny ever having
seen those gold plates i answered
moses and mrs aintree



  can you prove that i have seen them
she retorted can you prove that they

exist

  youre going to prove that i answered
when did you last see bhopal gosh

  she turned white on the instant and bit
her lip

  who told you about bhopal gosh she
answered

  mrs aintree i said the police
dont know-yet-that bhopal gosh mur-
dered gulad to obtain those gold plates
but i know it and so do you the police
theory is that you were jealous of gulad
and instigated someone else to murder him
youve got one way out

  what is it she demanded

  help bring bhopal gosh to book

  she caught her breath

  i wouldnt dare she answered in a
hoarse voice i wouldnt dare

  youve got to dare i retorted my
firm is willing to protect you we regard
you as the mere tool of bhopal gosh
but youve got to be frank and tell us all
you know about him

  he is the real organizer of the p o p
she said speaking almost like a woman in a
dream he is the power behind the
throne he promised me the throne but
he was always to be the power behind it
i know all that i answered and she
looked startled

  there is nothing under heaven so effec-
tive as telling your informant that you know
what has just been told you they jump
to the inaccurate conclusion that you knew
it before they spoke

  i d-ddarent turn on him she stam-
mered if he murdered gulad what is to
stop him from murdering me

  i have promised you protection

  you dont know him he is stronger
than two men and more cunning than ten
more than cunning he is inspired

  by the devil

  probably to hear him talk you would
believe him the greatest of philosophers
mr ramsden let that man alone dont
drag me into this i swear to you i had
nothing whatever to do with gulads
murder i didnt know he had been mur-
dered-hadnt a suspicion until mr
strange telephoned this morning this
business has ruined me i shall have
to abandon my connection with the
p o p-

  why

  b-because of the plates she stam-
mered i am totally discredited

  youve made arrangements to show
those plates at secret meetings of the
p o p

  she nodded

  hadnt they been shown to anybody
yet

  gulad wouldnt show them he was
afraid of losing them he was difficult
to manage he seemed to think that he
was being jockeyed out of his proper place
at the head of the movement he had
extraordinary fits of jealousy and i sent

for bh-

  yes i said go on you sent for
bhopal gosh what for

  i had to have advice bhopal gosh was
my teacher-the most resourceful man i
ever knew he came-interviewed gulad
-told me that he would manage him for
me-and went away again leaving gulad
more unmanageable than before so i
sent for another man from boston-
pananda-a man who was my teacher
formerly but all he did was to advise me
to abandon the p o p i shall have to
abandon it i cant help myself

  pananda gave you good advice i an-
swered-but youre going to undo some of
the harm youve done before you just step
back youre going to help catch bhopal
gosh

  i cant i darent

  very well come with me to police
headquarters my firm will turn its in-
formation over to the police

  mr ramsden you dont know what
you ask

  better than you do im better able
to judge the amount of harm youve done
already all over the world

  it was bhopal gosh not i every
move we made every detail of our propa-
ganda has all been thought out and di-
rected by him in advance he had an in-
tellect that i sometimes think is godlike
and-look at gulad for instance-poor
gulad who i suppose refused to do his
bidding i tell you mr ramsden that
man bhopal gosh will get you and get me
too if he isnt let alone leave him to
the police leave me out of it

  youre in it already i answered
have you no pity or respect for woman-
hood


adventure

  i laughed at that i couldnt help it
pitiable or respectable womanhood is far
from the picture she presented

ill protect you from bhopal gosh i
answered the point is will you or wont
you help willingly my time is limited 

     i pulled my watch out and
     stood up she was still hesitating

i must consult a lawyer
theyll let you see one at police head-
quarters theres an officer down-stairs

wholl call a taxi if you-

  no no dont do that im innocent
i can prove it very well mr ramsden
ill do all i can

  i sat down again and tossed my hat on
to the floor

  have you severed your connection with
the p o p i asked

  not yet there wasnt time

several white members beside yourself
yes cant always rely on colored peo-
ple to keep the real end in view besides
whites are quite essential when it comes to
hiring halls and things like that

  admit three more white members
  who are they

  brice allison and myself

  my nomination is all that would be
necessary but what is your idea

  have you called off future arrange-
ments-canceled dates for meetings-any-
thing like that

  there hasnt been time gulad and i
were scheduled to go on tour with those
plates and show them in secret session to all
the members everywhere

  dont call that off brice and allison
have the most important of the gold
plates-the only one that wasnt stolen
you can show it and say the others are in
safe-keeping admit some more colored
members too ill give you a list of their
names when are you scheduled to go on
tour

  wednesday of next week

  give me a list of the places and dates
she took a list from her writing cabinet
and i put it in my pocket

  i suppose your word is absolute among
your followers i asked

  she nodded a bit shamefacedly it was
the first sign i had seen in her of any really
decent feeling

  contradict officially then any rumors
about those plates having been stolen

the story will be kept out of the newspa-
pers if possible if it should leak out con-
tradict it

  very well

  and report to me instantly any effort on
the part of bhopal gosh to get in touch
with you if he writes dont answer him
without consulting me will you do that

  yes but he wont try hes far too
clever

  well see answer no questions from
outsiders

  i surely wont ive enough trouble
already

  one more point until further notice
mrs aintree the power behind the throne
as you have described it of the p o p
will be grim ramsden and ross you
understand me the control has passed

  she looked daggers but said nothing
she was not in the least convinced that she
had done wrong but regarded herself as
a martyr whose failure was due to meddlers
and to circumstances over which she had
no control but she hadnt the martyrs
courage for she surrendered utterly

  i had a talk down-stairs with the man
we had posted on watch and went from
there to the office on lexington avenue
where the clerical business of the p o p
was done the police had been there
ahead of me but i was permitted to make
copies of the fists of foreign correspondents
there was no trace of any secret code
but there were letters that suggested a
secret headquarters and an unnamed indi-
vidual to whom all questions of importance
and most financial matters were referred

  i had the lists of correspondents typed
out and mailed a copy of each to grim and
jeremy together with a long letter of in-
structions

having mailed those the next
thing was to track down as many
pupils of bhopal gosh as possible
so i hurried back to boston and with some
difficulty persuaded the indian pananda to
supply me with another dozen names

  the pupils whom i interviewed turned
out to be in all sorts of professions several
were extremely well-to-do the more pros-
perous they were the more highly they
still seemed to think of bhopal gosh a
lawyer in particular was loud in his praises

  bhopal gosh is a profound philosopher
he said he understands the law of
moses and mrs aintree



sequence and consequence he is a great
logician he sees behind the trivial pre-
tenses of so-called morality and shows those
whom he teaches how to avail themselves of
universal laws in business and in other
ways

  he has made money for you i sug-
gested

my prosperity is due to his teaching
have you made any money for him
the lawyer hesitated i may say ive
had several dealings with him-eminently
satisfactory all above board and from a
financial standpoint amazing

  do you know his present whereabouts
no he has discontinued teaching
things he taught went to the heads of im-
mature individuals some of whom got into
serious trouble but that was not his fault
i havent heard from him for weeks

  i found three of the ex-pupils in the peni-
tentiary

  im a crook said one of them i
pleaded guilty but i wouldnt have been
a crook except for that man i paid him
two hundred and fifty dollars for a course of
lessons in how to be dishonest without being
found out thats all it amounted to i
was found out im glad i was - caught
before it got worse

  the other two were even more indignant
one of them stated his intention of laying
for bhopal gosh as soon as he was free
again

  the man taught what isnt so he had
two hundred and fifty dollars of my money
and i got five years hes going to get
eternity when i get out of this-you watch
the prosperous pupils were all full of his
praises the disappointed ones-and there
were several-all swore he was an arch-
impostor who taught dishonesty as other
men teach chemistry or mathematics

  and its the hardest thing in the world
to forget his teachings one of them as-
serted she was a woman by the way
he makes you believe that black is white
by calling it gray and then leading you on
by one step at a time you catch yourself
forever afterwards hesitating between right
and wrong wondering whether wrong really
is as bad as its painted

  none of them knew bhopal goshs pres-
ent whereabouts not even the prosperous
ones all of whom admitted having let their
teacher stand in with them from time to
time in some successful deal or other

  why not was their invariable com-
ment

  bhopal gosh had run no risks he had
taught a sort of hair-line course of crooked-
ness and left his pupils free to follow it
when they succeeded he fattened on their
sense of gratitude when they failed he
let them go to jail until he murdered
gulad apparently he had let others take the
whole responsibility while he shared profits
only from that time on the chase began
to assume a new phase hitherto it had
been a sort of intellectual problem but now
all my old hunters instincts came to the
surface and i set out to finish bhopal gosh
as personally keen on the job as if he had
been a man-eating tiger i made no bones
about it didnt deceive myself gold
plates or no gold plates i was out to get
my man

  that he wasnt going to be easy to

bg get became more and more evident
 as i looked over the latest reports
of the case in the new york office in-
quiries had revealed the fact for instance
that he had no passport in the name of
bhopal gosh but that for more than three
years a bengali named lajpat shuddi had
constantly renewed one and the photograph
attached to lajpat shuddis application
blank bore a striking resemblance to that of
the alleged negro simon borrow ergo
lajpat shuddi simon borrow and bhopal
gosh were one and the same individual and
likely toprove an uncommonly elusive trinity

  that he was at large and in full posses-
sion of self-confidence was made clear while
i was reading that dossier the man we
had left on duty phoned in to say that mrs
aintree had just had a long-distance call
from chicago he had been interfered
with while trying to listen in some of her
meek ones had come down-stairs and
practically driven him away from the
switchboard however he had found out
that the call came from a public pay-
station somewhere within the loop

  i hurried around mrs aintree lied stur-
dily at first-said the call was from a friend
in springfield massachusetts who was sick
and wanted to borroftr money but she
wilted when i threatened her with the
police again

  im not guessing i assured her i
know you had a call from chicago was
it bhopal gosh


adventure

  she nodded

  what did he say

  mr ramsden i wont-i darent repeat
it

 why not

  he forbade me

  very well youre helping him to es-
cape the clutches of the law ill call in the
police

  mr ramsden i am not helping him
he is not guilty he called up to tell me
about the murder he said it was unfortu-
nate that the plates had been stolen and
that the murderer was probably too smart
for the police however he said he is
confident of finding the man and meanwhile
he himself feels that it will be wisest to lie
low both because suspicion may rest on
him mistakenly at present and also because
he will stand a better chance in that way of
catching the real culprit

  did you tell him theres a warrant out
against him

  yes

  you promised me you wouldnt answer
any communication from him without
consulting me first

  i couldnt help it she answered with
rising anger you dont know that man
i do know him i have a perfect right to
tell him there is a warrant out for his arrest
perhaps he will surrender to the police
who knows

 mnye-e-es who knows did you
tell him anything about the other gold
plate

  no he asked whether the p o p
members knew that the plates had been
stolen and i told him no then he said
a little ingenuity would show me some way
out of the predicament of having no plates
to show to the members and that he might
send me a suggestion before long

  what else

  no more he rang off then

  has he ever sent you any money i
demanded

  once a sum to cover expenses

  how did he send it check-draft-
money-order-letter of credit

  in hundred-dollar bills by registered
mail

  from what postoffice

  i dont know i threw the envelope
away

  when was it that he sent you money
  about three weeks ago

  have you ever seen his check

  never all the payments i have ever
seen him make were in bills

  have you ever paid money to him
often i have turned over contribu-
tions to him

  cash or check

  cash always he likes notes of rather
large denominations

  are those transactions shown on any
book

  i dont know i suppose so he keeps
the secret books himself

  dont you know where he banks the
money

  no

  that closed another avenue of search
effectually the banks are thoroughly or-
ganized among themselves for mutual pro-
tection and more crooks are caught with
their aid than in any other way but
it was safe to say that we would have
to run down bhopal gosh without the
banks assistance

chapter ix

   and if they all ojjers me a lil sweet nin capn

town on the southern deserts of this
country there is a reptile they call the
sidewinder hes a rattlesnake by habit
history and profession and seems to like
it not having changed his habits since the
first conquistadores came his chief char-
acteristic is that he invariably heads south
when traveling west besides he carries
a rattle on his tail packs a murderous dis-
position and has all the other rattlesnake
peculiarities

  we became sidewinders we had mrs
aintree basking hardly in the sun but in
the limelight of importance she would
have been happy on the gallows if only a
fair-sized crowd were there to stare at her
we carried that gold plate along with the
idea of rattling it until every darky and
most of the white folks in the towns we
visited should be aware of it and us our
party pretty nearly filled a pullman car
which made a fine long snake of us of as-
sorted colors and we headed south while
traveling west the murderous disposition
was a poor thing but mine own and by
way of fangs we had some smith and
wessons straight from the factory in
springfield
moses and mrs aintree



  the car that we engaged and that mel-
drum strange paid for was one of those
steel composite affairs with sets of drawing-
rooms at either end and regulation pull-
man berths in the middle so there was
plenty of accommodation for mrs aintree
and her party at one end brice allison
myself and three other white men at the
other and our dusky confraternity amid-
ships so to speak

  they were about as fine a collection of
u s darkies as you could assemble any-
where some had been to college some
had worked for banks and suchlike institu-
tions some had been therounds of vaude-
ville and half a dozen of them had rustled
soft coal in the bowels of foreign-going
ships we knew all about every one of
them from the day he was born more
than they thought we knew in certain in-
stances-for example that our middle-
weight prize-fighter and cleverest corner-
man had served a term in jail-and we had
every one deeded up as a full-fledged mem- -
ber of the p o p they ranked as as-
pirants in good standing subscription
paid and knew the secret ritual by heart
in fact they invented quite a lot of new
stuff on the train for the benefit of small-
town hicks who hadnt yet received the
latest lignt

  brice turned out to be a splendid travel-
ing companion and allison a tolerable one
although allison could see no humor in
the business and was much more exercised
over the expense than meldrum strange
who had to stay in new york but was pay-
ing for it all

  man the ineequity upsets ma mind
its a blasphemous and beastly or-r-gani-
zation run by the very hoore o babylon
hersef thats bad enough but we add
the offense o squanderin dollars a if money
werent the verra blood that should be cir-
r-culating in the veins o ceevilization

  he regarded every man with us as a
religious renegade and himself as the worst
of all

  brice is a pagan- ive long had ma
doots o brice-a good brave little body
but a her-r-etic in matters o releegion

i rue the day i said id go with ye on this
expedeetion but a mans worrd is his
wor-r-d and theres no takin it back
but lord forgie us

  he was the sort of man who would have
endured the rack a couple of centuries

ago rather than yield on the interpretation
of some obscure greek particle in one of
pauls epistles-the kind of man who came
over to this continent and founded a new
nation out of guts resource and pure pig-
headedness he went in fear of hell that
whole long journey solely from a sense of
duty and determination not to be outdone
by brice he reminded us of our sins a
little too frequently but he kept us awake
by preaching when we should have been
asleep and that as it happened provided
us with the clue that solved the problem
in the end

i  one of the members of mrs ain-
ifefkj trees party-the meekest of them
yttjai all and the most obsequious in look-
ing after her-was a man named carter
according to brice he was the individual
who had told grim too much in jerusalem
and so had started our investigation rolling
he had made up for it since by the most
painstaking discretion in fact he seemed
afraid to comment on the weather without
getting mrs aintrees permission first
he was a silver-haired man somewhere
between fifty and sixty who always wore
a black morning coat and carefully creased
trousers but economized on pocket-hand-
kerchiefs

  he had a way of walking about the car
treading cat-wise making no noise and if
ever we left the door of our drawing-room
open he would trip past two or three times
glancing in smiling and saying something
pleasant if we noticed him but if we
didnt notice him only too glad to get by
without saying anything at all i wont
say he aroused our suspicions because after
the event you always think you were sus-
picious from the first thats human nature
we told one another we had suspected him
but im inclined to believe that we fooled
ourselves on that score

  allison refused to sleep in a compart-
ment by himself because he had the gold
plate in his satchel and brice being rather
tired of him in some ways begged me to
take turns sharing the responsibility so
the first night out allison and i slept to-
gether and brice alone but there was a
door between the two compartments that
we left unlocked brice having nothing
to worry about and not being a nervous
sort of man forgot to lock the other door of
his compartment leading into the corridor


adventure

brice was in compartment a in which the
three of us had sat talking all the afternoon
i had the upper berth in compartment b
and allison the lower with the satchel
under his pillow and for a long time after
we put the lights out allison lay under-
neath me quoting pessimistic verses from
the book of the lamentations of jeremiah

  now im not a miserable-minded man

  it gets my goat to have to listen too long
to a sermon on original sin i believe in
original decency-monkeys are perhaps
descended from man for instance cer-
tainly not man from monkeys-just as i
believe in original gold in the everlasting
hills the only thing i ever knew except
toothache that could make me sleepless
is just such a sermon on the baseness of
the human race as allison got off his chest
that night so i lay awake listening to
brices snoring and wishing that allison
hadnt set his suit-case so as to keep the
door from closing by about an inch but
i was too lazy to get down and move the
thing

  it was about midnight when i heard the
door of brices compartment open softly
for a moment i thought it was brice on
the prowl but he snored on and i heard
the door click shut again as if some pussy-
foot had sneaked in then allison fast
asleep started pitching about as if under-
going in imagination all the torments fore-
told by jeremiah i took advantage of
that disturbance to get down from the up-
per berth without making much noise and
instead of opening the door between the two
compartments which would only have
scared the intruder into flight i slipped
out into the corridor through the door of
compartment b closed it behind me and
walked forward to the door of compart-
ment a

  i moved the latch and let the door swing
open as if the intruder hadnt fastened it
behind him and the motion of the train
had done the rest-then stood back in the
dimly lighted corridor and looked in

  it was our white-haired acquaintance
carter black morning coat and all he
heard the door swing open but i was in
time to see him withdraw his hand from
under brices pillow he started to close
the door again and actually had his hand
on it when he caught sight of me

  now ive met with gall from maine to
shanghai all the way around the earth

and back again-all sorts all grades and
all degrees but nothing to equal his i
guess youve got to be meek before you can
think of such a thesis as he propounded

  i came to stop mr brice from snoring
he said hes annoying mrs aintree
mrs aintrees compartment was at the
front end of the car at least fifty feet away
and between ours and hers were thirty
colored men putting up among them such
a saw-mill chorus as youd never hear any-
where outside of a lumber camp or a kraal
in africa i pushed him back into brices
compartment and turned the light on
locking the door behind me

  well really he exclaimed and brice
woke up with a start

fhpflf the next thing allison came stalk-
ing through the communicating
iilslill door with an old-fashioned duel-
ing-pistol cocked in front of him in his
pajamas with that pained intense expres-
sion on his face and his long nose following
the pistols aim he looked like one of those
cartoons of a frenchman hunting sparrows
that they used to print in england when
fashoda was the main topic of discussion
i asked him to put the pistol away for ive
seen accidents happen with thosq things
but he wouldnt listen to me

  well really remarked the silver-haired
intruder for the second time

  yell know its real when yeve a bullet
in ye answered allison disar-r-m the
man one of ye

  you might as well have talked about
disarming an old woman if he had had a
weapon-and he had none-it would have
been perfectly safe to leave him in posses-
sion of it he wasnt exactly frightened
he was more like daniel in the lions den
obedient to what he considered first prin-
ciples and confident that some way of es-
cape would open out-a much more diffi-
cult kind of man to deal with than the
blustering sort who always throw their
hands up when weapons fail

  sit down in that corner i said and
tell us what you were looking for under
brices pillow i saw your hand under it
the chiel was sear-r-ching for the gold
plate put in allison contemptuously
that answers too obvious to need confir-
r-mation

  let me go please said our unwilling
guest i am a member of this party with
moses and mrs aintree



a perfectly legal right to come and go in
the car as i please i came in here to stop
this gentleman from snoring let me go
please

  allison swore under his breath brice
looked at me whimsically

  did mrs aintree send you on this
errand i demanded

  she couldnt sleep she asked me to
do what i could about it

  an idea occurred to me that instant
if you call it intuition that doesnt explain
what intuition is any more than calling
the differential calculus a method of fluxions
brings you closer to an understanding of it

  youd better get out of here i said
knock next time youve any message to
deliver 

  he walked out without comment and i
slammed the door behind him opening it
again instantly and stepping out into the
corridor to watch he never once looked
back the impression i got was that he
was hurrying to reach his own end of the
car before he should be seen by someone
else if that was so he didnt make it

  as he passed midway down the car the
curtain of a lower berth drew back and a
kinky dusky head appeared it- wasnt
curiosity that drew that head out but con-
spiracy the difference in expression of
those two emotions is far too wide to permit
of a mistake carter appeared disconcerted
-really disconcerted for the first time--
whispered something hurriedly and passed
on the kinky head grinned and retired
inside the curtains but only for a minute
for as soon as carter had regained his own
compartment i went and pulled those cur-
tains aside again

  thah

  he had two false front teeth which he
removed at night and couldnt speak at
that hour without lisping

  follow me down to compartment a
he struggled into his overcoat looking
more like a chimpanzee than a human
although owning a good-natured grin that
offset certain other peculiarities his pug
nose resembled a dark piece of india-rubber
and looked as if you could punch it steadily
for an hour or two without causing its owner
much inconvenience he had a retreating
jaw that must have been hard to hit in the
prize-ring and one cauliflower ear never-
theless iiis bright little eyes gleamed with

unusual intelligence as i backed him up
against the door of our compartment

an he look tho dithappointed i come mighty
near laffin in his face

it sounded true sam carson
had fallen foul of the mann act
which like many other laws unavoid-
ably lends itself to blackmail and occa-
sional injustice vhen strange investigated
sams references and discovered that he
had been in jail even the deputy prose-
cuting attorney who had secured sams
conviction admitted that there might
have been a miscarriage of justice he
had eloped into another state with mrs
aintrees colored maid at a time when he
had a fairly large cash forfeit posted for a
match against one of the most notorious
ring-sharpers in the game and the combina-
tion of circumstances had been too strong
for him the woman was persuaded to
accuse him partly by mrs aintree who
resented the inconvenience of losing her
personal maid and partly by the men who
stood to keep sams forfeit money if he
should fail to appear at the ring-side
sam may have told the truth when he
pleaded not guilty at his trial and i was
pretty nearly certain that he was telling
the exact truth to me that night

  all right sam i said take anything
they give you if they give you a telegram
get off the train and send it

   f you thay tho capn

  dyou think you could make a copy of
it first

  ah aint no writin expert capn fight-
ins ma peculiarity he answered with a grin
can you read

  yeth thah ah can read good

  have you a good memory

  ah can member mos evrythin ever
happened

  if they were to give you a telegram and
you were to read it over twenty or thirty
times dyou think you could memorize
the whole of it

  ahs a fus-class memorizer ah mem-
bers the zac wodin o the telegram at
jack johnson send to his ole mother time
he knock the stuffin out o misto jeff at

reno ah members-

  thatll do the most interesting part
of their telegram will be the name and
address of the party its sent to get
that into your head so youll remember it
a thousand years if you live that long
then remember as much of the rest as pos-
sible dyou get me

  ahll do ma bes capn anything to
blige

  thats all except hold your tongue
dont say a word to a soul about your
talk in here with me tonight

  an if they all offers me a lil sweetnin
capn

  take it but no blackmail mind
youre not to ask them for a cent if they
give you nothing go ahead and send the
telegram just the same there are no
side-pickings on this trip unless you get
hurt in a scrap later on and in that case
well take care of you are you all clear
on that

  all cleah capn goo night thah goo
night gents

  he went off looking like a scarecrow in
an overcoat with sleeves much too short
for his long arms delight in being on
the inside of conspiracy made him do a sort
of double-shuffle down between the berths
and huge hands flapping at the ends of
loose arms heightened the illusion but
he made good on the memory test

  they left us on a side-track at a wayside
junction in virginia in the early morning
and we had to stay there until nearly noon
before a local mixed rolled in and they
hitched us to its rear end en route for ap-
pleton our gang piled out to invade the
short-order places that stood three in a row
within fifty yards of the depot and that
gave mrs aintree a perfect opportunity
none of her party left the car but brice
allison and i watched sam go lolloping
off toward the western union office and
presently he came back toward us mut-
tering to himself

  we let him keep on muttering it
wasnt in the game to let the aintree party
moses and mrs aintree



know that we suspected them of using sam
to upset our calculations he looked well-
paid and satisfied and sat in the car with
his feet on the seat in front of him moving
his lips like a monk at prayer until a crap
game started at the aintree end and what
with one disturbance and another it looked
safe enough to send for him to our compart-
ment

  he stood with his back to the door his
enormous feet together and his hands be-
hind his back displaying two removable
gold teeth in a grin like a souvenir of hallo-
ween and rattled off his piece as though
he went by clockwork and had been over-
wound or something

  what name and address were on the
bottom of the telegram i asked him

  caroline watts nine west twentythird
streetnew yorkcity thah 

  well with the aid of a pencil and paper
and by dint of making sam repeat the mes-
sage over and over it took about twenty
minutes to make sense of it all he couldnt
remember it unless he said it quickly and
when he said it quickly it was totally im-
possible to understand him to him it
seemed to have no meaning anyhow except
that he had been told to keep the change
out of a twenty-dollar bill however
we got the hang of it finally and let him go
forward well-pleased with himself

  nor was sam the only person who was
pleased if the telegram meant anything
at all it was that bhopal goshs alibi and
present address were now in my possession

i had never heard of lakelock but knew
that sparks is in nevada so it was fair
to presume that lakelock was somewhere
near

  caroline watts was clearly the nom de
plume of mrs aintree antonio vittori
was equally certainly bhopal gosh if i
could once catch sight of the brute i didnt
doubt i could corner him so i decided to
make appleton and after that to cancel
all the rest of the schedule and head straight
for sparks nevada

chapter x

res egaliter omnibus

it was nearly dark when we arrived
at appleton among bleak hills that had
been stripped of trees there were a few
truck gardens the inevitable roped cows
unthrifty-looking goats by the dozen and
of course pigs but nothing that resembled
farming it looked like one of those places
that import everything in tin cans milk
included and the empty cans made up most
of the scenery

  yet it wasnt such a small place it had
evidently spread during the war and had
begun to dwindle subsequently all the
straggling outlying parts of the town con-
sisted of mere shacks no longer painted and
inhabited exclusively by colored folk who
had come there for wartime wages and re-
mained because it was the easiest thing to
do there were rows and rows of empty
cottages and the white folks houses on a
hill at one end of the town wore a deserted
look as did most of the mines although the
pit-head gear in places appeared to be in
working order

  take it on the whole appleton was as
perfect a place as you could find for brew-
ing discontent you could hardly be happy
there if you tried what with falling wages
falling population falling houses trade
ambition everything mrs aintree
pointed out her home-a large frame house
on a hill-top standing in considerable
grounds but empty and i didnt wonder
that she lacked desire to live in it she said
that her late husband had controlled half
the mines in the place but the coal was low-
grade stuff and hardly paid for mining any
longer

  mrs aintree had engaged the town hall
ten days in advance and the place was


adventure

placarded with notices of a p  p revival
meeting that evening for members and
their friends but i turned our gang loose
through the town to do a little word-of-
mouth advertisement and having sat idle
in the train so long they were eating their
heads off for mischief the advance an-
nouncements of noahs flood probably
sounded somthing like the news they spread
through appleton

  mrs aintree seized opportunity to mail
a letter she said it was to her friend in
springfield but she wore her dark look as
she spoke and i knew she was lying the
postmistress wouldnt give me any informa-
tion so i wrote a short letter myself to
meldrum strange and registered it while
the postmistress copied the address into her
book i got a look at the previous entry and
as i expected it bore the name of antonio
vittori lakelock california

  that was perfectly satisfactory how-
ever quickly we might get away from apple-
ton it was a certainty that mail would reach
the border of california ahead of us for
our car would be hitched on to local trains
and dandled to a dead march across the
continent the more time antonio vittori-
bhopal gosh should have to mature his
plans the more likely he would be to fall
into our trap mrs aintree had served the
purpose so far perfectly it would be time
for her to send another telegram a day or so
before our premature arrival on the scene
so i didnt tell her anything about our
change of schedule until after we left apple-
ton next morning and sam received private
instructions in the mean time when she
did give him a telegram he kept it in his
pocket until i gave the word to send it off

  the p o p was a platform for her self-
esteem and no more she cared nothing
for the disappointment of her dupes only
her own predicament disturbed her seri-
ously and she believed that her only port in
the storm was partnership with bhopal
gosh the man who had supplied the brains
from the beginning she realized as well
as i did that the one gold plate we had with
us would be an irresistible temptation to the
man who had the other thirty-one

  bhopal gosh probably knew sanskrit
if so he could appreciate and probably had
told her that the stolen thirty-one plates
were unintelligible without the thirty-sec-
ond the kgy plate he probably told her
in imaginative oriental phrases how stupen-

dously important the complete set would
be and as a matter of plain fact he could
hardly have exaggerated the original law
of moses engraved on gold could be used
to produce a more effective world upheaval
than any scrap of paper signed at versailles
consider what the mormons did and are
doing what mahommed did and there
are others

  mrs aintree had- faith in bhopal gosh
and his adroit intellect she trusted him to
contrive some means of stealing it her
one remaining chance of wielding the world-
influence she craved was to help bhopal
gosh and then if necessary blackmail him
otherwise her folly in consenting to make
the journey with us in that car would be
inexplicable

  money did not appeal to her much except
as a means to a definite end the end that
she never lost sight of was self-importance
she yearned to be looked up to-admired-
reverenced she was willing to go through
anything to compromise to any extent to
condone any wickedness with specious argu-
ment provided only that her own sense of
importance should be bolstered in the end
and bhopal gosh who knew that side of
human nature being built of justsuch stuff
himself understood and laughed at her
as the sequel proved

  of course this is ex-post-facto analysis
it is extremely easy to deceive yourself
when looking backward and imagine you
were wise about it all from the beginning
the truth is that i had some uncommonly
discouraged moments and for instance
while we were waiting for our evening enter-
tainment i went and interviewed the chief
of the appleton police i took him quite a
long way into confidence

it was a hectic evening from the
start for darktown turned out and
filled the hall long before we got
there according to the chief of police there
had been nearly a score of free-lance
agitators in the town during the past few
weeks every one of whom had left a stand-
ing grouch behind him

  so they were ready to be preached to
they wanted to be told that heaven lay
just beyond the hill and could be reached
by revolution we had our own men scat-
tered about the hall before it filled and one
or two of them made alleged impromptu
speeches before the opening ceremony with
moses and mrs aintree



the idea of keeping good humor as near the
surface as possible for it was a risky game
we were going to play-the sort of game that
follows better on a joke or two than on
solemnity 

  our fellows had the ritual down fine and
had even improved on it it had mostly
been designed by mrs aintree with a view
to the superstitious appeal and in order to
lend solemnity to her ridiculous pretensions
for instance after a dreamy hymn there
was a solemn parade around the hall in
indian file each man doing the lock-step
with his hands on the shoulders of him in
front that was supposed to represent the
wanderings of israelites in the wilderness
for forty years and it might have gone right
well on this occasion if our men hadnt
interjected sotto voce jokes reminiscent of
the a e f one laugh led to another and
they drowned out the piano finally by sing-
ing the old songs that some of them had
howled in france

  so by the time mrs aintree entered
pompous as a peacock with her staff around
her they were ready for pretty nearly any-
thing except serious business we had ten
trumpeters who represented the israelitish
heralds sounding the blast that blew down
the walls of jericho five trumpeters stood
on each side of the door as she entered
surrounded by meek white minions and fol-
lowed at a decent distance by brice and
allison carrying the gold plate framed up-
right on a tea-tray i came last and received
an ovation although i did not know why
until sam informed me afterwards that he
had advertised me as the champeen heavy-
weight long-distance african golfer of the
whole wide world

  at the sound of the first blast they all got
to their feet there were five more blasts
while mrs aintree strode up the aisle
magnificently at each of which they were
supposed to shout glory hallelujah the
kingdom is at hand by the seventh blast
mrs aintree had reached the platform and
they all sat down throwing one leg
over the other to signify that the walls
had fallen and that all they had to do
now was to enjoy the feasting and the
loot

  there was quite an obvious difference
between members and their friends mem-
bers knew which leg to throw over which
for instance-a very important point they
also knew the responses and were all the

  more readily tickled into ribald laughter by
the new ones interjected by our men

  mrs aintree came to the front of the
platform and stood there holding up a hand
for silence but silence was a long time
coming circumstances were against her
the tattered old crimson canvas drop-cur-
tain had not been raised to the full distance
and she stood exactly underneath the
daubed recumbent undraped figure of a
fat and silly-looking bacchus engaged in
pouring a stream of yellow wine out of a
blue cornucopia he was leering down at
her it was only a matter of seconds ap-
parently before the stream of wine would
splash on her head the audience refused
to stop laughing until somebody went be-
hind and raised the curtain to its full height
then-

  what is the sacred number she de-
manded in ringing tones

  seven they answered

  come eleven shouted one of our men
and a roar of laughter greeted that which
she did her best to ignore

   oh you little lucky lovely rollin bones
said someone with a bass voice like a bulls
and that pretty nearly brought the house
down however she continued- 

  how many are thf tenets of the
p o p

  seven they answered

  what are they she went on instantly
giving nobody a chance to interpose a joke

  the reply sounded like a sunday-school
class reciting the catechism in quick time
brotherly love for all black races
brotherly blacks in portant places
wilderness once crossed is over

  tired ones have a right to clover
  handsome is as handsome does
  whatever is good is good for us

  res egaliter omnibus

  even dog-latin you see to give it a
properly scholarly flavor

  ahs agwine ride in dat omnibus some-
one shouted from the rear of the hall no
moah flat-footin them ole deserts ahs
hit them ties too offen hee-hee ahs
agwine ride

  giddap yelled someone else

  no chillun this heahs a motor-bus
aint agwine be no mewls this trip

  honk-honk ting-a-ling pah-pah
who aint paid his fare

mrs aintree tried to laugh it off good-
naturedly but her anger was rising her


adventure

frown betrayed her and the audience
realized that perfectly they set them-
selves deliberately to annoy her and suc-
ceeded beyond their wildest expectations

  she tried to make a speech but they
interrupted with cornerman remarksf the
more she tried to brow-beat them with
eloquence the worse they got out of hand
egged on by our conspirators strategically
posted to produce the most effect

  my friends she began i have
brought you a surprize from new york-
or rather from beneath the sands of ancient
egypt

  ah trembles wid antiquity oh hold
ma hand

  you were promised the privilege of
feasting your eyes on the thirty-one

plates-

  wi turkey on um an sweets an
gra-avy- oh you tha-a-nksgivin show
me them eats

  -but we have a greater privilege in
store for you tonight instead of bringing
the thirty-one plates that were promised
and which would have been a cumbersome

and difficult thing to do-

  not nuff room in dat ole omnibus
plates no use anyhaow widout knives an
forks yah-hah mebbe gyptians didnt
use no knives an forks fingers plenty
good nough for them gyptians

  -we have brought you the most won-
derful thing in the world-the veritable key
plate drafted by the hand of moses him-
self-the original moses-think of it-and
bearing a portrait of moses done by an
artist of his day engraved on the original
solid gold plate on which in sanskrit an
ancient tongue are inscribed the key words
by which with proper understanding the
secret mystic marvelous writings on the
other thirty-one may be interpreted

graggfj she paused for breath and they
were really silent for the first time
that was quite a bomb to spring on
any audience and there was quite a number
of them in the hall who had been sufficiently
filled beforehand with a sense of the serious-
ness of what they called their pisgah vision
to have won the rest over had she known
enough to keep their attention fixed on the
treasure instead of redirecting it toward
herself but she was so constituted that
she couldnt help herself being quite capable
of being jealous of an inanimate object if

that should detract for half-a-minute from
her own importance

  since i ceased to live among you she
resumed being called elsewhere to higher

duties-

  leaky ole roof needs mendin-wouldnt
spen nuff dollars on de ole roof thats
what

  tenant hes gone too he said -

ole house not fit for man to live in he
va-a-moose an pay no rent

  somes been dug all the taters out o
tater patch yeah no more taters
winows all bus in house begins look
like hes hanted

  rats in dat ole house biggern possums
o-o-oh

  -i have always had a kindly feeling-
more a passion in my heart for apple-
ton-

  doggone ole slag-heap aint got no pas-
sion lef kiss muh honey appleton an
say goobye ahs gwine follow whar lady
luck done up an went-shes mah beau
i -and therefore it is you from out of all
the hosts of lodges of the p o p who are
the first to set your eyes on this priceless
heirloom of the centuries

  oooh our eyes ache lookin at yuh
honey boy moses yo sho resembles lady
lucks genlemn frien ooey you is good
to see

  dawgonnit dat stuffs yaller go-o-old
you-all done hear dat niggahs

  i patted my hip-pocket which was bulg-
ing rather ostentatiously as i stood at the
end of the line next to brice and allison who
were holding the tray between them alli-
son nudged me and moved his lips as if i
were responsible for the safety of his only
child and for a moment i feared he intended
to snatch up the plate and decamp with it
which would have started a riot almost cer-
tainly but in the pause that followed the
last negros remark mrs aintree swept into
her stride once more she was full of cour-
age of a kind that woman and not minded
to be laughed out of countenance

  but you seem to be in an impudent mood
tonight she went on some spirit of un-
rest has made you forget your manners
you seem inclined to overlook the fact that
i have come all the way from new york
at tremendous cost and inconvenience to
show you what many other men-and white
folks too-would almost give their eyes to
see i find you in no mood of reverence
moses and mrs aintree



the years i spent among you teaching must
have had effect but tonight you forget your-
selves i bear no malice but i see no humor
in your stupid jests and you certainly cant
expect me to stand here and talk to you un-
less my words fall on properly attentive ears 
wes lisnin honey wes de lisninest
folks what is

  yah-hoo mali haids stuff up wiv
lisnin an i aint heard miffin yet

  silence order niggah shut yo mouf
and so i think it better for tonight that
one of your own people should address you
perhaps youll give him a more attentive
hearing perhaps when you realize how
deeply one of your own people is impressed
by the sacredness and vast importance of
this relic that you are being privileged to
see-perhaps then you will listen to him
more respectfully and try to show your
appreciation of the unheard-of good fortune
that is yours tonight

  she stepped back a pace or two and one
of my men at the back of the stage produced
a chair for her allison and brice took chairs
as well but i didnt care to sit down for i
knew what was coming more or less and
the others didnt-least of all mrs aintree
who supposed i had provided a speaker capa-
ble of undoing the p o p with faint praise

  but my man stepped forward from the
rear with a grin on his face that might
have disillusioned her if she hadnt been
paying so much attention to the set of her
skirts he was a big stout darky-a college
graduate-who had spent most of his time
trying to force his way on to the legitimate
stage earning his living meanwhile in small-
town vaudeville with occasional side-ex-
cursions as a member of a quartette and
now and then when times were bad a spell
of ballyhooing for a one-ring circus he had
a magnificent barytone voice and was not
only dressed in evening clothes which
suited his ambition finely but was drawing
the best pay he had ever come in contact
with outside dreamland-tom tulliver by
name as decent and as clean-living a colored
man as i want to have any dealings with
and an expert in the psychology of his own
race as well as a bom actor

folks he began and if he had
been a white man with burned cork
on he could have held any audience
after that first word i wuz agwine to call
you jokes but you-all aint funny enough

for that you aint got nuff nthusiasm
to crank a car with you aint aware o all

  im agwine discuss wiv you tonight
about moses he killed a gyptian plice-
man-did it easy cause the plice in those
days didnt have no shootin irons an
moses was that indignunt what wiv the
cops fresh line o talk an one thing and
another that he smit him good an hard
he nonplused that gyptian lef his carcase
lyin there an beat it the gyptians
sicked their bloodhounds after him but


adventure

 the dogs in those days hadnt no more nose
 than jackrabbits an moses giv em the
 ha-ha tendin sheep sos to have somethin
 in the envelope when pay-day come aroun

    he tended sheep for forty years out on a
 ranch somewheres till the statute o limita-
 tions run out an his pictchah in the rogues
 gallery wuz all faded-an him so changed
 what with the mean livin on the ranch and
 him growin a beard an gettin older an
 gettin a new suit o cloes-till them
 gyptians couldnt recognize him no more
 then he come back cause the ranchin
 werent the fondest thing that he wuz of
 by no means he was plum fed up with it
 but he knew moren he once did theres
 wasnt nothing you could tell him bout
 sheep

   well he come back an he found the
 ol house up on the hill where he used to
 live all failin to rack an ruin-winows
 busted in-no more taters in the tater-
 patch-rats runnin roun big as possums-
 place looked as if it wuz hanted an moses
  looks aroun an sees a lot o sheep on two
 laigs workin for the gyptians that
 started him off thinkin

   he went an sat up on top o the big
 pyramid an figured it all out watchin
 them chillun of isrel workin so hard for
 the gyptians down below there an finally
 he came to a conclusion them bein things
 at any feller comes to when he makes his
 ol bean work furious an moses he wuz
 plum furious all through he didnt want
 to go back an live in that ole rack-an-ruin
 shack of a place full o rats an hants an
 no tater-patch nor anything so he come
 to a conclusion moses did an him knowing
 what he did about sheep he mighty soon

ies to keep the money circulatin i aint
foolin yo an thats all gwine come about
jes cause o this heah pictchah on a gole
plate what white folks had fetched fm egyp

  by that time he had to keep pausing
between sentences to let the howls of
laughter die before he could get another
word in the whole hall seemed to be
rocking to and fro with mirth and about
the only two people in the place who werent
grinning from ear to ear were allison and
mrs aintree allison could see no humor
in it

  are they all dementit is the body
makin jokes he asked me behind uplifted
hand

  and mrs aintree could see nothing in it
all but gross indignity inflicted on herself
nor could i blame her especially as she
floundered straight into the mud-puddle
that i half-feared she would see in time
she went in with a splash-all two hundred
pounds of her and the noise of it gave birth
to silence for about ten seconds

  stop she thundered with both fists
raised ill not have another word of this
its bad enough to have to sit here breathing
this atmosphere without being insulted as
well ill summon the police and have the
hall cleared if i hear another word of
sacrilege and treason

    that turned the trick the
twenty or thirty initiates and
aspirants who had seen their way
clear to an easy living on the strength of
her unusual doctrines and who even yet
had hopes perhaps based on money un-
accounted for began to take mrs aintrees
part noisily about fifty men got to their
feet allison whipped the plate off the tray
and stowed it in his satchel

  take that precious plate out of here
bawled mrs aintree take it away from
their profane eyes

  she was half-crazy with wounded vanity
but if she had been wholly mad she couldnt
have made a worse break from her own
stand-point or a better one from mine

  its our gole plate its the p o p
gole plate somebody bellowed and there
began a rush for it as sudden as those gusts
of wind that pick up a dust-whorl in the
desert it was exactly simultaneous with
a rush by our own men who reached the
platform first and just about sixty seconds
in advance of an invasion by the appleton
police who kicked the locked door open and
wasted no time on preliminaries

  its no use telling me there wont be
fights in heaven twouldnt be heaven if
that were so valhalla we had to wade
in that crowd had had its laugh and the
laugh had kept it good-humored but
youll find it safer to take a beef-bone from
a wolf-hounds jaws than to disillusion any
swarm of men colored or otherwise the
more they have laughed while the disillu-
sioning went on the swifter and the fiercer
the reaction afterwards half those fellows
realized that they had been made fools of
from the first by mrs aintree others
didnt know what to think but decided to
get the gold plate anyhow the mob-
spirit accounts for the remainder they
all came on the run some of them hurling
chairs at us over the heads of the men in
front

  it was one of the toughest jobs i ever
faced to get that gold plate and mrs aintree
out of appleton town hall without injury to
either sam was a wonder he took the
corner of the stage where the flight of steps
led up from the floor and none who saw
him or who met the calculated swift
ferocity of his attack could ever more won-
der why he wasnt wanted in the ring that
time when they pocketed his forfeit money
and railroaded him to jail instead but
there were too many of them even for him
he got an ugly slash with a razor and i
had to leave mrs aintree to the gangs
protection and go to his aid since they
had drawn razors i had no compunction
about using chair-legs and i bucked the
swarm brandishing one after the style of
samson when he slew those thousand
philistines with the jawbone of an ass
only no ass jaw nor chair-leg could break




adventure

a black mans skull swat you never so
emphatically -

  the surprizing part was that nobody pulled
a gun on us i had a pistol in my pocket
but didnt propose to use it against our own
invited guests except perhaps as an abso-
lutely last recourse and there was never a
moments real doubt of the outcome with
the police working their way toward the
stage with the aid of night-sticks going
through their mob-drill like automatons
and turning suddenly at intervals to drive
the rear of the mob out into the street i
daresay the whole business was over in five
minutes but it was a jewel of a fracas while
it lasted a jewel of a speech too that the
chief of police made from the front steps
of the hall to the disgruntled remnants who
remained to rub their heads and hear him

  an thats the last of this p o p
foolishnes well have in this town if yez
have any sinse at all wan more word
about it an ill p o p pop the lot of yez
into the coop ah what with foines an jail-
sintences yell wish yed never heard o
moses let alone seen his photograph get
along home now all of yez an step smart
and as for you maam he went on turn-
ing on mrs aintree im sorry to say im
ashamed of ye ye ought to know better
for yeve lived here long enough i knew
yr old dad an your husband or id say
more good night maam

  he turned to me last accepted a cigar
cocked it upward at the stars between his
teeth and grinned

  well have peace here for a while he

said but - thats a wonderful pair o

fists ye have where the diwle did yez
learn to use em

chapter xi

man the plates gonel

i wont go so far as to pretend that
relations as between mrs aintree and
myself had been exactly cordial hitherto
they had not but up to the point of that
lodge meeting in appleton we had been able
to observe the amenities we had presented
to the world at large a reasonably amicable
front she detested and despised me and
while i did not overestimate her charms or
her integrity i was rather sorry for her so
we had managed to exist on the same
pullman car without exploding

  but to be made ridiculous was too much
i had committed the unforgivable offense
she hadnt a forgiving disposition at the
best of times but i had passed the rubicon
she could no longer look at me without glar-
ing could not even see me without mutter-
ing  could not frame polite words in answer
to the customary social salutations and on
top of all that she was imbecile enough to
suppose that i wasnt alert for her ven-
geance

  it is only the secret enemy who is dan-
gerous the man or woman who makes
faces at you or defies you openly is as easy
as a rattler to contend with for you have
had notice her lust for revenge was as
venomous as concentrated snake-juice but
she seemed to think herself possessed of
a fairy-book cloak that rendered her hatred
invisible

  a half-witted man would have realized
the absurdity of her continuing another
mile with us unless she were planning to
upset my calculations

  when i canceled all arrangements next
morning and had to send sheaves of tele-
grams to shorten our itinerary and provide
connections that would take us by the short-
est route to sparks nevada it must have
been obvious to her that i had some other
motive than to break up a p o p lodge
meeting the p o p was done for ridi-
cule would finish it sparks according to
our reports was the center where the move-
ment had made less progress than anywhere
else but such people as mrs aintree-
and there are lots of them--are more fatal-
istic than the moslem and ascribe every
unexpected move to a calculating destiny

  she wanted to get to sparks i had
changed all plans and decided to go to
sparks at once therefore obviously
destiny was playing her game and in due
course would deliver me to destruction
ably and vindictively assisted by herself
if you look around youll find any number of
people who habitually argue with them-
selves in some such way as that

  there began to be a sort of surreptitious
glee observable in mrs aintrees manner---
a confident cocksureness blended with the
hate that would have forewarned an ostrich
with its head stuck in the sand she began
to make an awful fuss over sam dressing
his wound about three times as often as was
necessary and flattering him with honied
words for having fought so nobly as she
moses and mrs aintree



expressed it in defence of womanhood
sam liked it there never was a darky who
didnt enjoy that kind of treatment but
when she gave him a telegram to send to
sparks he brought it to me immediately
and i let him keep it in his pocket for several
days before dispatching it

  antonio vittori lakelock california all
arrangements suddenly changed expect whole
party at sparks evening of thirteenth confident
in your ability to devise and arrange solution
count implicitly on me to carry out instructions
but would like them as soon as possible your
pupil

from the morning of our leaving
appleton until the thirteenth the
railway people treated us to the
losers end of every gamble on connections
but we reached sparks at last after an
almost endless crawl across sage-brush
desert that lies waiting for nothing but
pumps and persistence to make a new gar-
den of eden of it and almost before the
train rolled to a standstill half-an-hour after
sunset our game began again in earnest
they cut our car off and bunted it in the
direction of the engine sheds-then trun-
dled it back into a bit of rusty siding where
we could stay until sparks became para-
dise if we happened to feel that way about
it and for all that anybody cared

  a fellow with a neck like raw beefsteak
crossrabbeted into furrows allowed that
that would do and turned his back to
superintend the moonrise and there we
were-plus the local sheriff two italians-
one of whom looked like a bootlegger and
the other like dante come to life again-
and marvel of all marvels terence casey
stepping forward out of semi-darkness like
a ghost in an old-time play

  yes me boy the-its me an a fine

fools errand yeve brought me on not
send for me i know ye didnt did ye
write to meldrum strange though did
he sind five-an-twinty telegrams to wash-
ington until they transferred me to this job
or did he not and did i take the overland
an arrive here a day ahead av ye i sure

did and of all the -s own places to

have to waste time in this is the devils
choice or my names moses same as so
many o your friends ill introduce ye
now to mr arthur brandon county sheriff
maybe ye dont know a man any longer
when ye meet wan this is him sheriff
this is mr jeff ramsden ex-iliphant-

hunter and now lunatic at large watch out
fr his grip hes hefty

  i looked straight into the eyes of the real
west the quiet all-observing eyes that
are used to vastness and afraid of nothing
he was as big as i am standing with two
fingers of his left hand hitched into his
trousers pocket his right came forward
slowly for me to shake and i liked him
warts freckles wrinkles old gray flannel
shirt and all

  forty years old or a little more with eyes
of twenty-five skin like leather a ready
smile and a way of standing that pretended
nothing asserted nothing except his own
faith in the universe and his permission to
all concerned to share it with him if they
chose

  after the manner of his kind he said
nothing conceding the first deal or shot if
you like to the stranger

  im watching those two whaps i said
it may be one or other of them has a mes-
sage for some one in the car so if i want to
know it

  casey took that hint and drew apart to
observe both car-ends from a point ox
vantage

  i hope casey has saved time by telling
you most of the details of this business i
said and he nodded

  casey and i had a talk last night mr
ramsden he doesnt seem to think much
of your alarm

  are you willing to look into it with me
  you bet

  do you know a man named antonio
vittori a dago living just over the border
at lakelock

  he nodded again

  yes quiet man great studyer eye-
talian not a dago they say hes all right
hes the man im after

  --- supposed to have murdered a
colored man isnt he do you figure that
killing is always a crime mr ramsden
i guess you and i would agree on most
points if we had time to discuss them i
answered antonio vittori is an indian
is that so

  im here to convince you how far does
your authority extend

  no further than the borders of this
county but therell be no difficulty about
getting the california bunch to help us out
you expect this antonio vittori here
tonight


adventure

  maybe i suspect those two italians
are you sure hes not in sparks this min-
ute

  we can find out does he figure on
killing a few more coons i notice youve
brought along a lot of live-bait

  weve a gold plate with us that hes nuts
on he killed that colored man to get the
rest of the set-but the sets worth not
much more to him than bullion without the
one weve got and he knows where it is
i believe hell try to get it

  new york state warrant in order
sure federal warrant too i believe
ask casey about that

  well take him and see whats in this
well casey what dyou make of it
ramsdens right that whap with a
face like montezuma passed a letter to mrs
aintree shes writing hes on the plat-
form waiting for an answer the other
whap beat it i guess hes gone to tell some
one that the letter was delivered

  well soon see

  the sheriff turned to one of his assistant
deputies who was leaning against the side
of the car chewing tobacco and listening
alertly without asserting himself in any way

  shorty i think its up to you to follow
that italian who was here a minute ago
dyou know where he went

  shore i cn see him now

  see where he goes and bring me word
ill be here awhile yet

  the deputy walked off without comment
rolling himself a cigaret as he went re-
sembling by no means a salaried proponent
of the written law he looked more like
a dry-goods clerk on his vacation except for
a certain measured litheness in his walk

  just a minute said the sheriff
theres one thing i can do right now

he walked to the end of the
car-the end that he had been
watching across my shoulder-and
reached it at the same moment that the
italian with the dantesque face began com-
ing down the steps

  what are you doing he demanded
been stealing a ride no what have
you got there

  allrighta boss i jus taka letter thass-
all

 you-liar youve been stealing

  no boss honest to god strika me
dead i taka da letter

  cut the talk prove it

  the italian pulled an envelope out of his
hip pocket the sheriff snatched it out of
his hand glanced at it showed it to me and
gave it back it was addressed in a womans
hand in pencil to mr a v

  all right you get by this time

  the italian hurried off

  have you got time to follow that man
casey asked the sheriff and casey
strolled away with both hands in his
pockets

  what did you figure on doing with this -
minstrel troupe youve brought along the
sheriff asked me and i countered with
another question--

  have you had any trouble in sparks
with a colored society called the p o p
not what wed call trouble in this part
of the world theres quite a number in the
railway sheds they hired an iron shack
on the edge of town and the talk in there
went to their heads a bit they got to
pushing white men off the sidewalk that
was as far as it went they dont use that
shed no longer

  where do they meet now i asked
they dont they were in that shed
when we started to haul the uprights out
from under it theres a donkey-engine in
the next lot and we had a chain passed
round the drum with a hook at the other
end made fast to a couple of four-by-fours
they came out like black bats flitting out of
- and since then they been kind of su-
perstitious about holding meetings why
do you ask

  my plan was supposing you agree to
turn my outfit loose and let them get in
touch with these p o ps i hope to dis-
cover whether antonio vittori has been
mixed up with the p o p in this town
if so well have another line on him
and-

  - the sheriff interrupted be-
tween you and casey weve got lines
enough well pop over into california in
my car get a search warrant and a couple
of deputies from over there and look him
up if youve got the evidence well fix
him

  mrs aintree-she who wrote that note
just now and sent it by the italian-is an
accomplice of vittori-bhopal gosh i an-
swered she has been sending him tele-
grams he expects us here he knows
weve brought along a gold plate that he
moses and mrs aintree



wants hell make a desperate attempt to
get it and he has almost certainly made
arrangements for getting away directly

afterwards hes a-clever rascal and

the last person in the world to find cooped
up at home at a time like this

  whats your idea anyway he an-
swered scratching the back of his head
to set some kind of trap for him

  id hate to get bhopal gosh without the
gold plates and he may have hidden them
ill give you any help i can

  this colored gang of mine is hand-
picked i answered let them circulate
and if they can find one of their race here in
touch with bhopal gosh theyll send word
that theyre loyal p o ps and can
steal that remaining plate and get it to
him he wants it badly enough to take a
chance

  hm sounds rather like trapping a
bear with sealing wax but maybe i dont
quite get the value of that plate-to him
i mean as you say if hes half-clever wed
hardly find him at home all right turn
your gang loose youd better caution
them weve been cleaning up this town
some of the boys might conclude to make
a fresh start

  our colored crew were interested in one
subject only at the moment-supper natur-
ally they were standing around us close
enough to call attention to themselves and
no pack of hounds at a days end could have
looked more wistfully anxious

  brice and allison were packing up me-
thodical men both they always arranged
their compartment as if they expected visit-
ors allison liked to have his spare shoes
and slippers at the bottom of the bag with
the things on top laid neatly so the business
of tidying up took time i wanted to cei
them out and introduce them and had
turned to do it when something occurred to
put that for the moment out of mind

e there came a herd of colored
men from the direction of the sta-
tion platform mostly in overalls
lurching along and laughing obviously of
one mind-a big hefty-looking lot and
maybe forty of them they approached our
crew and began making the idiotic p o p
signs in less than a minute there was a
regular reunion taking place with the
sheriff and myself more or less in the midst
of it

  things seem to be working out to suit
you said the sheriff

  i was looking about for sam he being the
one who usually caught on to a notion
quickest and had just spotted him on the
outside of the crqwd when mrs aintree
came hurrying heavily down the car steps
and pushed her way toward me shoving the
darkies away to right and left as if they
were so many ninepins she was m one of
her towering passions-full of what she
imagined was divine fire-so wrathy with
self-righteousness that nothing but her own
ideas and her own convenience had any
weight as far as she was concerned

  you wicked devil she began marching
right up to me i suppose you are planning
to stage another sacrilegious farce who is
this man

  the men of the west have manners
the sheriff drew back until he was obscured
in shadow and began to take apparently
intense interest in the conversation of the
darkies

  you will pay for all your doings mrs
aintree went on you think youre very
smart i know your thoughts you think
the money and the praise youll get for this
is recompense enough for all the harm youre
doing youre being well paid for it and
you simply ooze self-satisfaction youre
a disgusting sight mr ramsden let me
tell you that

  ill give you permission to tell me that if
thats whats troubling you i said

  troubling me i am far from troubled
she retorted i am simply trying to stop
you before you destroy yourself with your
own wickedness you could do good if you
chose but you choose evil the way of the
transgressor is hard mr ramsden you
are laying up hell for yourself and i would
save you from it if i could

  she meant every word of it although by
holding my attention she was also forward-
ing an almost perfect piece of cunning
i believe she was obeying orders she caught
her breath for another outburst but there
came an interruption from the other end of
the car-behind me in the dark

  help help

  it was allisons voice i went to the
rescue but im a trifle slow at starting and
the sheriff reached the steps ahead of me
swung himself up by the hand-rail and was
first into the car i brought up short be-
hind him the doors of compartments


adventure

a and b were fastened together handle to
handle by a piece of stout wire twisted as if
someone had used pliers for the purpose it
took time to unfasten them for the wire
was too thick to cut with an ordinary clasp-
knife and all the while allison kept wrench-
ing at the door from the inside taking up
the slack and making our work more diffi-
cult however we got both doors open at
last and allison came stumbling out with
blood all over his face brice was lying
unconscious on the sofa bleeding too

  have ye got him allison demanded

  got whom asked the sheriff

  ye mean yeve let him get away ye
mean- my god dye know whats
happened did ye not see where he went
are ye stricken daft oh this expedeetion
i knew from the verra first it was for-r-e-
doomed

  sit down and tell us said the sheriff
quietly pushing him by the shoulders while
i gave a hand to brice who seemed to be
recovering consciousness

  man the plates gone there cam
a dark-faced loon through yon door wi a
girt stick in his han and wiout sayin one
wor-r-d he struck at brice an me as if we
were cattle an he a flesher wi a pole-ax
i held up ma han to save brice for the
fir-r-st blow was aimed at him an there-
look-theres where the blow landed on ma
for-r-earm then he str-r-uck me in the
face wi his other fist an grabbed ma
satchel the strap broke then he struck
brice who was up an cornin for him then
he struck me again an we were baith un-
conscious for i dinna ken how long-an
then i tried to get out an ca for help an
the door was fastened an so the plates
gone-the only one we had left-gone for
good and a an poor brice dead--a good
little man a good little frien was brice
ill not forgie masef

  your plans dont seem to be going quite
so good do they said the sheriff eyeing
me with a dry smile

chapter xii

feller you were right just nowl

a llison whose arm had really re-
 ceived the worst damage insisted on
having brice taken to the hospital and
mourned over him like a lost child maybe
in that way the edge of his grief over the

stolen plate was softened in some degree
which was as well for only antiquarians can
guess what pangs he suffered

  however neither the sheriff nor terence
casey showed more inclination than i did
to take the theft for what diplomatists call
a fait accompli casey and the sheriffs
deputy returned together and casey was
the first to get the hang of the situation

  those two whaps just walked about
town he said they knew they were be-
ing followed they were decoys i asked
your deputy to lock both av em up and
theyre in the coop now there was noth-
ing in the letter that wan av em carried
pie knew it it was blank paper

  i get you said the sheriff and
these coons i guess were sent down here
to keep the other coons from standing in
the way inside the car

  then mrs aintree came and bawled me
out said i to hold our attention while
the trick was being worked bhopal gosh
sneaked up to the car from the far side got a
word in her ear and-it all fits

  fits foine said casey just a min-
ute

  mrs aintree had shut herself into her
compartment casey mounted the steps
and rapped on her door one or two of her
meek minions tried to prevent him but he
kept on hammering until she called out
come

  youre under arrest-you and the lot
av ye he informed her through the open
door wheres that letter ye received just
now by the dago

  he came out swearing and laughing al-
ternately and showed us a handful of
ashes

  she burned it he said and darn her
ft e broke up all the ashes in the spittoon
ye can photograph whole ashes but not
broken wans

  well theres no place in our coop for a
lady said the sheriff well leave her
in the car and ill set some one to keep
watch weve about one chance to take
vittori or gosh or whatever his name is
nevadas kind of big if he once gets into
the mountains hell be difficult to catch-
have to send a posse after him and comb the
woods homes the likeliest place where
hed cache the new york loot sos to have
it handy for a get-away hell figure on
beating back home-had his car parked
somewheres close at hand hell aim to
moses and mrs aintree



  pick up the loot he cached at home and head
  for california thats my guess any o
  you good at guessing

    anyone you can phone to in lakelock
 i suggested

   wires been down since yesterday
 trees are always falling across the wires
 not much of a job to fix but devils own
 time to get there specially when the gangs
  are busy if gosh has a high-powered car
 and his nerve-and it looks as if he had-
 hes going to be hard to overtake my
 cars ready

   taking one thing with another bhopal
 gosh had twenty minutes start of us in-
 cluding five at a cafeteria where we threw
 some food into the car then we went like
 the fire chief to an all turn out alarm with
 casey and one deputy on the rear seat
 and there was some  scuse it please
 driving as we slipped out through the home-
 going cars of the railway hands and their
 families most of them driven by women
 and followed the trolley-line by way of
 reno

 fjg-q we left the interurban standing
 -csflpj still and whooped through reno
 out on	concrete pike without

 having killed anybody so far then the
 sheriff opened her out and we really took
 a chance or two past steamboat springs
 where the vapor from the caldrons under-
 ground hung like great ghosts over the
 landscapes the only casualty as far as
 carson was a cat that ought to have known
 better it was a black cat and casey
 swore seriously

    if it had been a white wan now that
would have been the same as killing bad
luck but yeve killed the good luck
t divvle take it

   however at carson we got news and
 knew we were on the right trail the
 sheriff drew up at a hotel where they once
 used to lay out the victims of shootings
 on the pool table but now sell meals to
 ranchers wives there were half-a-dozen
 loungers in the bar busy bewailing the old
 days

   got anything to drink the sheriff
 asked

   nothing worth while said the bar-
 keep

   serve us some o that anybody know
 antonio vittori-lakelock way

   sure two men knew him he

passed through carson in his car twenty
minutes back

  what sort of car what make
didnt notice - hes no auto-
thief he dont need to steal nothin
big car or little one

   twerent a ford-hup-overland-
reo-some such make-nothing a guy like
him would help himself to hes got
money im telling you

  well get him come on night you

fellers did he go by truckee or-

  no not truckee up to the right-
nearest way home i reckon

  we piled in and the sheriff let her go
again

  that hills going to slow him to a walk
lets hope the gangs fixed the road for
winter no small car can clear the ridges
without slowing for them and if thats so
well nab him inside washoe county
up she goes feel this brute purr-never
knew a son-of-a-gun like this for eating
hills

  the conversation grew disjointed for the
sheriff set his teeth and drove to suit jehu
son of nimshi the fellows behind were
clinging to the seat for the road-gang had
put the ridges in and every fifty or a hun-
dred yards the car would kick like a cow
pony just off grass

  the moon shone clearly enough to show
the precipices on our left hand-sheer
goshrizzly things that fell away from under
us for hundreds of feet with never a yard of
clearance if another car should want to
pass and our lights showed hair-pin curves
ahead such as made the reputations of the
old stage-drivers i kept my hair on by
remembering that the sheriff would hardly
use all that speed unless he knew the road
intimately but the little he said was
scarcely reassuring

  thats where the stage went over last
june with eleven passengers he said
once werent missed till next morning
boys found em all dead but one and hes
still in hospital this next curve were

coming tos a - hold tight there

didnt i tell you therell be something
happen there one o these days they
ought to set that ridge about a rod this
side of where theyve got it tell those
men behind to take a look at their guns
this indian friend of yours may try con-
clusions darned good places hereabouts
for a man to stand you up-that clump of
adventure

trees ahead for instance a few shots
through youj radiator sit tight here
now

  we swept around a curve with a yawning
cliff six inches from the near wheels and
saw the whole of the finest valley in nevada
stretched in moonlight a couple of thousand
feet below ahead the road curved to the
left at last and we could see it snaking
along nearly milk-white for a mile or two

  there he is see his lights hes in
trouble no hes off again changed a
tire i guess well weve got him now

 unless he takes to the woods i
suggested

  if the sucker does that weve got him
sure said the sheriff holding a line
through these woods is quite a trick wed
have him inside fifteen minutes sit tight
all im going to step on her

it came pretty close to being his
last act in this world-close to being
the curtain on the four of us we
were still mounting but the grade was not
so stiff and the speed indicator touched
forty-five then nearly fifty as we slid into
the shadow of tall sugar-pines that loomed
above the road on our right hand then
neatly as the picture on a screen slips off
and gives place to another one we swerved
aside and went headlong over a steep bank
there was lots of time to think it was
like riding in an aeroplane with air that
moonlit valley smiling up at us

  the sheriff leaned forward and switched
off the spark as the car took a sidewise tilt
in mid-air and we crashed into splintering
tree-tops the car remained up there with
one front wheel spinning on apparently
forever in the calm moonlight dumping
cushions tools and us on to a ledge below
that provided foothold for the friendly
trees i remember i thought it an awful
shame that the trees should break our fall
at such immense cost to themselves but a
fellow has strange thoughts sometimes
in a crisis

 that was a -- of a way we came
said the sheriffs voice from somewhere in
the dark beside me look at where we
left the track-way back there we
coasted through the air forever pretty near
my foots busted anybody else hurt
worth mentioning

  im killed said caseys voice theres
nothing holding me but i cant movel

  the other man didnt answer and i
moved about trying to find him when i
stumbled on him he was breathing and i
lugged him and casey to the sheriffs side
so that the two of us could feel them over
but you couldnt make sure in the dark
how did it happen i asked the sheriff

  - i caught sight of it too late you

remember we thought hed changed a tire
all hed done was fasten thick wire at an
angle across the track just high enough to
ditch us smart ill say suppose you
climb up and unhitch the wire before some
one else comes along and gets hurt

  i climbed up the wire was of the same
thick gage that had been used to fasten
the door-handles in the pullman and was
wound three times around a tree-trunk led
across the road and then made fast to a
rock if we had hit it straight we might
have jumped or broken it but the angle
was such that you couldnt have hit it
straight even going at slow speed it
would have turned us outward over the
side of the cliff and it was nothing but the
speed we were using that landed us among
the trees instead of on the rocks this side of
them i let the wire down the cliff-side for
a hold-fast and clambered down to hoist
those three men one at a time to the road
the sheriff came easiest his ankle was very
badly sprained but he could help with two
hands and the other foot the other two
had to be carried and it took i daresay
half-an-hour casey said he was in no
pain but felt numb all over and the other
fellow was obviously suffering from con-
cussion

  dyou suppose youd be all right if i
leave the three of you here i asked the
sheriff

  sure going back for help therell
be some one along in the early morning
well get picked up all right still if

youd rather-

  will you be all right i asked him
  sure whats eating you

  then ill go on give me directions

how to reach that -house ill go get

him or have a durned good try

  feller you were right just now the
sheriff answered you and i would agree
on most things i guess ill swear you in
as deputy hold up your right hand
so well call you sworn casey youre
witness remember if you get him the
california side of the line youve no
moses and mrs aintree



jurisdiction in that case plug him and do
the arguing about it afterwards if you catch
him this side plug him and there wont be
no argument have you got a good gun
take mine

  this ones an old friend

  now remember he may go slow now
figuring on having ditched us good i
guess he saw our lights as we went over
i hate to lose that good car listen five
miles up the road on the right-hand side
theres a shack belonging to a man named
norcross if his phones working call up
every police station within a radius of
thirty miles and get a crowd started on the
way to meet you at your mans house
maybe old norcross  lend you a rig but
hes moody youll be taking a chance if you
borrow his rig without asking

  ill take another chance or two i said
good boy now theres this bhopal
gosh may have his plans all laid for crossing
lake tahoe by boat

  how bigs the lake i asked

  thirty miles by sixteen and more than
a mile deep where theyve found bottom--
coldest water anywhere-drowns you quick
and never gives up its dead if hes got a
boat you try to get a car--take his maybe-
and get around the lake to head him off
youll be able to see his boat all the way
across in this moonlight stop wherever
theres a phone and keep the gangs wised
up whatever you do dont follow him
alone across the water hell spill you and
you wont stand a chance besides a bit
of a wind across that lake  upset any but a
stout craft and the best are none too safe
howll i find his house

  cant mistake it follow this road
about nine miles as straight as shell take
you the side-tracks to the right all go to
million-dollar huts where the californians
lead the simple life in summertime you
keep straight on his house is on the left
facing the lake theres a garage in line
with it big enough to hold four cars and
the house is a brown shingle affair with a
-of a big roof pitched steep like a hill-
side it stands by a clump of sugar-
pines and whether hes got servants or
any one to help him put up a fight i cant
say get to a phone like i told you and th en
watch the place and wait for help to reach
you good luck its usually luckiest to
shoot first remember that

  ye owld amachoor daytective ill

bet ye the drinks yell never get him
murmured casey by way of farewell

       i very nearly overtook my man at
the end of about two miles for he
really did have tire trouble and a
hard job changing shoes i came on the
discarded shoe with a loaded revolver near
it that he had let fall in the dust when he
took his coat off and saw his tail-light dis-
appearing around a turn not three hundred
yards ahead of me he was not going fast
either his engine was badly overheated or
else he was sure of having killed us and
overconfident but no matter how fast
you walk a car going at only fifteen or
twenty miles an hour is going to leave you
pretty nearly standing still and i didnt
catch sight of his tail-light again

  in ordinary circumstances i would have
reveled in that walk instead of cursing
every bend in the road that only showed
another bend as soon as you rounded it-
and that again another bend beyond
some six or seven thousand feet above
sea-level the air was perfect and the
scenery as wild as any man could wish i
even saw a bear lolloping across the road
in front of me and hove a rock at him out of
sheer envy because he might enjoy the
solitude whereas i must hurry on

   i made what i took to be norcross shack
well within the hour but there was nobody
home i made noise enough to wake any-
one a mile away and tried to break the
door to get to the phone but failed how-
ever there was a gray horse standing in the
shed and a spider-wheel rig that would
just about hold together as long as the
horse refrained from coughing so i wrote
a note on a leaf from my note-boolc saying
that the rig had been taken by a deput y-
sheriff and would be returned next morning
and drove away at a slow trot-the best
that nag could offer he had only three
gaits anyhow the second was a walk and
the third was to sit down on his rump be-
tween the shafts and think a while so i
let him trot five miles an hour or maybe
six

  and try how i would i could find no
telephone  all the places except one that
i tried were unoccupied in that place
there was a chinaman who grinned and
said no can do he proved it too by
letting me try the phone it was as dead
as gulad the abyssinian


adventure

    so i drove and it began to feel lonely
  under those huge trees with nothing to
  disturb the silence except an occasional
  wind-moan and the clop-clop-clop of that
  disreputable horse

    as far as my experience goes its untrue
  that a fellow reviews his whole career in a
  - moment of time when death looks him
  straight in the face but this i have found
  true-that when youre going forward to
  what you expect will be a crisis all the
  circumstances that led up to it review
  themselves whether you will or not until
  you are sick at heart from recognizing
  half-a-million mistakes you made and two
  or three opportunities you overlooked
  after i left the norcross shack i daresay i
  thought of thirty better ways to bring
  bhopal gosh to account

    nevertheless strangely enough and un-
  expectedly enough i didnt experience the
  slightest fear until the old horse trotted
  around one last turn between sepulchral
  pines and cedars and on my left hand in a
  clearing loomed the house that must be
  that of bhopal gosh if the sheriffs de-
  scription of it was correct

    then fear struck me like a cold breath
  there were no lights visible there seemed
  to be nobody about but i could hear an
  engine purring in the darkness by the front-
  door and the horse threw up his head and
  neighed

chapter xiii

lake tahoe dont give up her dead

 t t occurred to me to go at once and
 put that car out of commission i might
 possibly need it for pursuit but setting off
 one possible contingency against another it
 seemed wisest to dish the car so i tied my
 borrowed rosinante to a tree walked up
 the drive and tore out the wires leading
 through the dashboard to the switch that
 was decidedly enough to delay mr bhopal
 gosh if he had not gone already

    however as it turned out i made a mis-
  take i could have caught him handily by
  leaving that car purring away peacefully
  with its lights full on but the minute i
  tore out that handful of wires the circular
  glow of white light cast by the lamps on the
  front of the house vanished simultaneously
  it didnt occur to me until then that bhopal
  gosh would not have left the house in dark-
  ness with all that illumination on the outer

wall unless there was something to be
gained by it

  its not easy to puzzle out the other fel-
lows motives at a time when the least false
move is likely to lose you the game a
crook thinks crookedly if youve spent
your waking moments for thirty or forty
years endeavoring to think straight youre
out of harmony with a villains reasoning

  all that i accomplished by extinguishing
the light was to give bhopal gosh notice
that someone was close on his trail that
glare on the house wall had been visible
from the lake shore a quarter of a mile
away and i now saw somebody come carry-
ing a lantern from the lake toward the
house he was coming in a hurry-didnt
notice that the lights had gone out until he
nearly reached the road still well out of
pistol range perhaps two hundred yards
from where i waited then he saw my gray
horse for the moon had dispersed the
shadow in which i left him standing

  i tried to figure out what i would do if the
positions were reversed but gave it up
i didnt know why he was returning to the
house i remembered one of terence
caseys sayings that crooks me boy
always overlook something for thats the
natur of a crook ye catch em because
they blow their noses on a dead mans
handkerchief or some such idiotic stunt as
that

  that didnt help much bhopal gosh
wasnt blowing his nose in fact i couldnt
see him i could only see the lantern
i watched the lantern steadily for several
minutes until it dawned on me that it was
hanging from a twig and its owner had gone
elsewhere

  the odds were now that he was hunting
me as he knew the ground and i didnt
those odds were a hundred to one in his
favor i elected to stay where i was for
the moment between the car and the front
door listening for a footfall that would give
me a hint of his whereabouts i heard two
sounds-first the pop from the exhaust of
a motor-boat engine down by the lake
shore but he hadnt had time to reach the
boat i decided that the boat was moored
with its engine running ready to get under
way the moment its owner should come

  the next sound came from the direction
of my rig i heard the shafts fall to the
ground-a smart slap as somebody hit the
horse-and then the click of hooves as the
moses and mrs aintree



beast started off homeward at an easy trot
it was like a game of freeze-out-funny if
id been in a mood to laugh i had put out
of action a car that he possibly didnt want
and had demobilized myself as far as possi-
ble pursuit went he had discovered that
not more than two men were on his trail for
that rig would have broken down under the
weight of more than two and he had cut
off my retreat

  what puzzled me most was why he didnt
make straight for the motor-boat i heard
his heavy footstpes over to my right be-
hind a row of trees and he was walking as if
he weighed a ton breaking twigs and crash-
ing through the undergrowth like an ele-
phant at feeding-time i elected not to
walk into that trap time was all in my
favor

if i had been sure that he hadnt
another car waiting at the rear of
the house i would have headed for
the boat at once and put that out of com-
mission but it was possible he was calcu-
lating on my doing just that and did have
a car in reserve so i waited not so much
reasoning really as acting from intuition and
habit developed in hunting days - it was
that refusal to come out in the open and be
seen that forced his hand he had to try to
unmask my batteries somehow and took
a rather silly way of doing it

  he began to scream like a beast in agony
pausing to wait for a reply and then scream-
ing louder as that had no result he yelled
in english that he was caught by the leg
in a bear-trap if it was true i was glad
to hear it he might stay in the trap i was
certainly not going to be such a fool as to go
and investigate and what was more he had
done me the favor of demonstrating that he
was all alone for obviously any one within
hail would have gone to his assistance but
nobody did go he left off yelling after a
few minutes as a man at all prone to yelling
would hardly do with his leg caught in the
iron jaws of a bear-trap those things hurt

  continuing to puzzle away at the prob-
lem i decided that he had gone down to the
motor-boat to get the engine started and
had then come back to the house for his
treasure perhaps there had been some
doubt in his mind whether he could start
the engine and he had preferred to make
sure before committing himself to that
means of escape if those heavy gold plates

were in the house yet it was hardly likely
that both he and they would escape me
before morning

  but he had grown suspiciously quiet
again and i listened intently wishing that
contact with cities and railroads hadnt
dulled my hunting ear i could hear the
motor-boat popping away steadily but not
one sound from bhopal gosh the lantern
swaying gently on its twig still burned
brightly where he had left it

  his next move took me utterly by sur-
prise the porch light was switched on sud-
denly from inside the house and i stood
exposed between the door and the car at
pointblank pistol range i ducked around
behind the car astonished that i wasnt
fired at and from that position peering
under the top i caught sight of his face
looking through a window to the right of the
front door i pulled the wrong pistol from
my pocket-his that i had picked up in the
road beside the abandoned tire-took a
snap shot at him and missed but he didnt
shoot back it dawned on me that i had his
only firearm true to terence caseys dic-
tum the arch-crook had overlooked one
simple necessary point

  that settled it i smashed in the win-
dow with the pistol-butt and scrambled in
cutting my hand but as luck would have it
not badly enough to make it useless the
door at the end of that room slammed in my
face and i heard the key turn on the out-
side but i took a heavy chair and swung it
ax-fashion breaking the door down in less
than a minute that let me through into
the hall he had switched the light off and
was doing something in a devil of a hurry
for i could hear his heavy breathing not far
off then i caught the metallic hum of a
safe opening and the rattle of the handle of
the inner sheet-iron door as he fumbled
with it in the dark by the sound i judged
he was at the end of the hall so i fired the
same pistol i had used before to try and
catch sight of him by the flash-or hit him
if i happened to be lucky

  what i did see was the wall-button that
controlled the electric current i heard
another door slam and by the time i had
switched the light on bhopal gosh was
gone but he had not removed the plunder
although he did get away with the key to
the inner door of the safe

  the safe stood under the main stairway
and was an inexpensive affair with a
o

adventure

combination lock on the outer door which
he had left unfastened in his hurry i dare
say i could have forced that inner door with-
out much trouble if given time but it
seemed wiser in the circumstances to leave
the treasure in there and return when i had
reckoned with the man he wasnt likely
to be doing nothing while i fooled with the
safe

  so i went back for another chair and
smashed the door on the right-hand side 
the safe that he had disappeared through
it was a good heavy office chair with an
iron revolving screw in it and iron-braced
legs so the door went down in short order
but at that i wasnt in time there was a
cellar below-stairs piled high with old dry
cord-wood and ms the door crashed out-
ward a stinging cloud of white smoke met
me with the crackling of blazing bark and
splinters

  i charged through with the idea of catch-
ing him before he could take advantage of
the smoke to give me the slip altogether
i was holding his pistol in my right hand
having shoved it in my hip pocket while i
used the chair for a battering-ram making
two pistols in one pocket and as i rushed
through i grabbed the first one that my
fingers closed on bhopal gosh was waiting
for me just inside the door and seized me
by both arms from behind

       it needed no expert in intuition
vtg- to guess what his game was then
--- he meant to hurl me down into the
blaze below and return for the contents of
the safe and it was a new experience to
discover myself almost helpless in the arms
of a stronger man all up and down the
world i have only met three amateurs who
could beat me with their fists or on the mat
and they had to work for their laurels but
this fellow twisted the revolver out of my
right hand with the ease of a gorilla and
flung it down the cellar stairs into the gal-
loping holocaust below us

  yah-ah-ah he laughed

  but it was an expensive little joke for
as he let go my right hand to hurl the
weapon away i swung sharp round to face
him and crashed my fist into his mouth
cutting it a second time on his magnificent
teeth but giving him far the worst of the
exchange however he had me by the wrist
again before i could reach for my own re-
volver and luckily-so swift he was-before

he even guessed that that was my intention

  the heat was already terrific once or
twice when a draft caught them the
flames licked over the top of the cellar
stairs and he started to force me backward
toward that hell grinning in my face ma-
levolently as he stepped forward like a great
fat dancing-master-only it was muscle that
made him bulk so big it was the first time
i ever felt really helpless in the grasp of a
stronger mantnd after the first strain that
warned me of his enormous power i wasted
no more energy on trying that issue with
him

  i relaxed my muscles suddenly by the
light that roared behind me i could see the
triumphant malice in his face but he was in
no hurry he was enjoying the foretaste of
victory-grinning like a great ape you
could see how he had been so easily mistaken
for italian by men who were not suspicious
of an alias yet his face grew more mon-
golian as you examined it and he took
care that i should examine it thrusting it
close to mine in order to peer into my eyes

  you feel the fire behind he sneered
the brute wasnt even out of breath

  you are going down into it backwards
but we will wait just a minute or two and let
the flames take hold because there is a door
leading from that cellar to the garden and
you seem to have a gift for breaking doors

  he thrust his great dark face still closer
to mine so that his enormous shoulders
rose higher than his neck i guessed him at
fifty inches around the chest with every
other detail in proportion but he may have
been bigger than that

  i am curious about you he went on
you are not of the police are youone of
those poor fools who discovered a treasure
that they could not keep you are too un-
wise for providence-i suppose you would
call it providence-to leave it in your
hands you would not know how to use it
i do i shall use it i shall leave you
roasting here and take it away with me
youre not talkative its your last chance
to talk you know until you come into the
world reincarnated as a beetle or a rat
you dont like the prospect of being burned
to death it terrifies you too bad you
would prefer the butt of malmsey wine
selected by the duke of clarence

  even the least astute of us become one-
horse philosophers as we grow older when
any man starts boasting in my face i take
moses and mrs aintree



courage boasting is the inevitable prelude
of disaster im convinced of that and an
ounce of conviction is worth a ton of any-
bodys argument i knew that minute that
he might hurl me down into the fire but if
so he was coming with me and i guessed i
could face those flames as well as he
could

  maybe he read the determination in my
face he started there and then to force
me backward and i tried to throw him
with a trick of the heel he saved him-
self from that but lost his balance and i got
my left fist free gaining a good two yards
away from the flames and sending my left
home three times once into his wind and
twice into the region of his jaw he had to
let go my right wrist to protect himself and
i got my right home into his left eye before
he closed

  then gripping like a bear he began to
force me backward once more lifting me
as my ribs cracked under his pressure he
had me under the arms which left both
fists free and i rained blows on his mouth
and eyes that would have taken some of the
fight out of a spanish bull i guess i blinded
him for the moment i could feel the sicken-
ing scorch of the flames behind me as the
floor-beams and door-posts caught but
i caught him by the neck and swung clear
and if i hadnt been in too much of a hurry
he would have gone down into the cellar
instead of me for i drove for the region of
his ear with my right fist and the blow
went wild

  then i thought of my own revolver in my
right hip-pocket and he thought of all out-
doors the smoke and flame were blinding
the back of my jacket was smoldering and
i think his coat was too at any rate with
his eyes half-shut and with the floor-beams
beginning to crack under our combined
weight he lowered his head and charged me
like a bull instead of meeting him with my
knee as i should have done i stepped aside
took a shot at him and missed missed
him at fifteen inches so much for smoke
in the face

  swe  both went out of the house
like rabbits running from a grass-
fire he straight by way of that nod-
ding lantern for the motor-boat and i after
him with the flames behind us lighting up
all the windows now as they caught the
draft from the open front door it was only

a matter of seconds before the whole house
was a raging furnace

  i was out of breath for he had crushed my
ribs in badly and on top of that i had swal-
lowed a lungful of acrid smoke what was
worse i am built rather for heavy work than
running races and for a man of his prodig-
ious weight and strength he was fleet-
footed but he ran with his hands to his
eyes i had done him harm enough to
equalize the odds

  moreover he wasted energy his short-
est course to the motor-boat was not by
way of the lantern in order to take the
lantern en route he had to cover two sides
of a broad-based triangle giving him at
least an extra hundred yards to run yet
he did that and i took the shorter route to
cut him off wondering what strange frenzy
possessed him and supposing that his eyes
might be so badly hurt that he was running
half-blindly for whatever he could see

  yet he didnt pick up the lantern he
paused there for half-a-second tugging at
something else that shook the lantern to the
ground as it came loose from the tree and
carried whatever it was away with him he
was still in the lead by a dozen yards and i
tried a shot as i ran with no result except
apparently to increase his speed and of
course i had to slow down for a second in
order to take aim which gave him a few
more yards of advantage

  i had now four shots left and no spare
cartridges on the other hand in spite of
the pace i was beginning to feel better as
the smoke got pumped out of my lungs
moreover the fire by now was enough to
alarm the countryside they would turn out
to save the forest trees if nothing else and it
was likely i would have help any minute
yet he was gaining on me-careering like a
hippopotamus for his own element cover-
ing an ell to my yard as he crashed through
and over everything i never saw any man
take such enormous strides as he did and
all the way with his hands before his face as
if i had done his eyes real damage

  he was easily fifty yards ahead when he
reached the waters edge and hesitated be-
fore jumping to the beach below  in that
uncertain moonlight and with my hand no
doubt trembling from the run it seemed
like a fools chance to take another shot
yet i took it-stopped dead aimed care-
fully and fired i hit him he dropped
something that was hanging from his arm


adventure

clapped his hand to his side and toppled
sidewise over the bank

  i did that last fifty yards in record time-
my record at all events i figured on jump-
ing on him from the top of the bank and
finishing the business but when i reached
the bank he was clambering off a short
plank pier into the boat and snatching
feverishly at the lines to cast loose he had
made the boat fast in two places which was
in my favor but he got both lines free and
the instant he had thrown the clutch into
gear and opened up the gas he crouched
below the boats side

  i remembered then that there is such a
thing under heaven as horse sense i could
have easily wasted my three remaining
shots in an effort to plug him but the boat
was a considerably larger target i fired all
three deliberately plunk into the boat and
one of them damaged the engine

  it doesnt take much to stop one of those
single-cylinder affairs i hadnt done much
harm to the engine for he got it going again
in less than a minute but during that min-
ute the water must have made headway
through two bullet-holes and by the time he
began to pay attention to it the water was
swishing all over the bottom what with
the state of his eyes and the darkness he
couldnt find the trouble for a minute or
two after that he seemed to be lifting off the
seat-covers and looking for a pump but
there was none for he began bailing with
a small tin can then the engine gave a
final cough and quit for good

  i lit a cigar im willing to take oath
that if there had been a boat within reach i
would have put off and tried to save him
for the hangman but there wasnt any
boat i daresay he had taken care there
shouldnt be and as for swimming-he
might swim in that nearly ice-cold water if
so minded i tested it with my hand and
knew that i for one couldnt stay afloat in
it for two minutes

  one of my bullets must have done much
more than bore a hole in the hull for he
could have bailed against two or even
against three bullet-holes but though he
worked like fury the water gained on him
and i could see the hull submerging inch by
inch

  fie lost his courage in the end completely
the chill of that rising water around his
legs gave him too definite a foretaste of
what was coming he began to scream for

help and to call on some deity i never heard
of i tore two planks off the pier and hurled
them as far as i could out into the lake but
he was a quarter of a mile away and i doubt
even if he saw me throw them he could
never have reached them anyhow

  he went down screaming and the cold
calm water closed over him with a ring of
ripples that danced in the moonlight until
the last ever-widening circle nearly reached
the shore then i turned to examine what-
ever it was that he had dropped when my
bullet touched him and clambering up the
bank discovered nothing less than allisons
leather satchel

youll be right if you- suppose
that i unbuckled the flap with
trembling fingers maybe i shouted
--i dont know-when i discovered the gold
plate safe inside but it was badly dam-
aged my bullet had struck it near one
corner ploughed through the soft gold for
several inches itself expanding as it went
and finally had gone clear through to expand
its last momentum on the ribs of bhopal
gosh the plate had been further damaged
when he dropped it for it was bent out of
shape and i think he must have stepped
on it because a good deal of the scripture
was obliterated nevertheless it was the
plate and i had at least something to re-
turn to poor old allison

  there was no more chance of recovering
the other plates than of gleaning snow on
the plains in midsummer we had left the
outer safe-door open and the whole house
was a roaring furnace it might be possible
when the ashes should cool off to recover a
shapeless mass of nearly pure gold but it
was far more likely that the safe had tilted
forward as the beams gave way underneath
it and the stuff as it melted had run out and
got lost so thoroughly that its recovery
would cost more than the game was worth

  i tried to get some of the fellows who
came racing to the fire to help find a boat
and look for bhopal gosh but when i told
them sufficient of the circumstances they
laughed at the idea

  never dragged a corpse out o that lake
yet unless in the shallows inshore the
cold sets them solid the body dont form
no gas and they stay down there a mile
deep no lake tahoe dont give up her
dead and never will till judgment day

  so i borrowed a big car instead and got
moses and mrs aintree



two of them to come back along the road
and help me with the sheriff terence casey
and the deputy less than an hour later
as we drove dead-slow around a bend i
heard the sheriffs voice-

  i notice you got your man he called
out

  now i dont know how he knew that nor
would he tell me how he knew but he swore
that he knew it from the moment that our
headlights came in sight around the corner
i asked the deputy about it who was not
much the worse for his experience by that
time and he laughed

 shore he knew he answered he
werent guessing he told us two that youd
got your man fore ever he spoke to you at
all didnt he casev

  he did that said casey it all comes
o running over that black cat any man
in his senses knew that somebody was going
to get the gate tonight well lord be
praised it wasnt me im due for me pen-
sion hey steady lift me easy-easy
you im not the inimy ramsden yere
after pulling me to bits

fcsks so if you should have the good
luck to visit london one of these
days and should have the sound
horse sense and taste to pass a portion
of your time in the british museum turn
first into the egyptian gallery and if you
see there in a glass case by itself a battered
gold plate with a great trough plowed
across it so as to obliterate the head and
shoulders of what was once the portrait of
a man youll understand how it came there
they have marked it very ancient prob-
ably period of israelitish occupation mostly
illegible purpose unknown for they are
cautious men who conduct that institu-
tion

  but theres a middle-aged scotsman at-
tached with no ver definite duties to that
department they say he is rather a mental
wreck and has been more or less pensioned

in that way hell tell you the whole story
of that gold plate and better by far than i
have done but better not mention my
name to him for he vows and will vow to
his dying day that i know quite well where
the rest of the plates are and that i mean to
unbury them some day and offer them for
sale when i suppose the game is safe

  but just ye watch hell tell you in
case you should mention me ill balk
him ill expose the chiel ill bring him to
his downfall yet

  brice on the other hand is still digging
for antiquities in egypt and he and i are
great friends

  and if you should happen to meet terence
casey-hell be guarding a president or
tracking down a forger or some such childs
play--you might remember me to him and
if he says to you as he surely will the minute
that you mention me-

  my friend ramsden is a well-meanin
man ill have ye know and a good man of

his inches he knows a -of a lot about

ilyphints and if he had his rights hed be
with a circus or curatin at the bronx
park zoo but hes gone into the amachoor
daytective business and thats not a fit
subjec for conversation-not with prohi-
bition running wild

  if he says that to you as he will you
might remind him that he owes me a round
of drinks-a point that he unaccountably
forgot when he came out of hospital and
you might add that as good drinks are hard
to come by these days id be grateful if hed
come across

  and as for what became of mrs aintree
and of the foreign entanglements of the
p o p most of which we had to straighten
out before our job was done let me remind
you all once more of those indian story-
tellers who invariably pause and pass the
hat when it would seem that their audience
has had its moneys worth

author of the odyssey of chander roy

onroy should have been con-
tent to derive his information
from books and explain his
mission in life to well-chosen
friends in his clubs smoking-room then
he would have acquired a reputation and
his monographs on the advancement of civil-
ization among native races would have
been accepted without reservation

  as matters stand now however conroy
snarls when the word native is mentioned
in his presence afld in his more impassioned
moments he recommends the use of poison
or other foul means to rid the earth of his
erstwhile dark skinned brethren

  it all happened because some ten years
ago when he was inspecting cattle stations
on the fringe of the great australian desert
he was invited to witness the aruntas totem
dance thereafter he ceased to be merely
one of new south wales farseeing finan-
ciers as the sydney papers called him and
acquired a mission in life on the strength
of his one close contact with aborigines he
decided that they were unfortunate people
downtrodden by the brutal white races and
he brought a good deal of influence to bear
to have their conditions improved

 such was his enthusiasm that he read
spencer and gillens australian abor-
igines and looked at the wood cuts in
codringtons melanesians people took
him seriously because he had much money
and controlled far more live-stock than any

  the naked truth copyright  by j d newsom



man should really be allowed to handle
he even wrote a couple of articles for a daily
paper urging the abolishment of marriage
by capture among the cape york tribes and
the establishment of compulsory education
because he nearly succeeded his mission in
life became an obsession

  he talked folk-lore at directors meetings
until somebody suggested that he visit
some of the pacific islands and make a com-
parative study of existing conditions as he
had just cleaned up half a million pounds by
selling out some western sheep-ranches just
before the big drought he decided to act on
the suggestion

  ill make things hot for the colonists out
there if i find any slavery or oppression he
told one of his acquaintances just before
sailing ill raise the roof people know
me ill expose em

  going to new caledonia asked the
acquaintance

  yes worse luck got to go to noumea
and transfer there to a schooner for tanna
in the new hebrides

  why not stop off for a few weeks and
look over the island queried the acquaint-
ance we have a cattle-station out there
at a place called nakitalo mclaird our
manager tells us the interior is full of tribes
who have never seen a white man he
could put you up ill give you a letter of
introduction

  splendid boomed conroy
the naked truth



  he was a large man with a heavy red face
barred by a fierce upcurling moustache
and he affected a broad smile which never
quite reached his round prominent eyes

  splendid he repeated

  and if you think the place looks promis-
ing and i assure you it is added his friend
we could talk things over when you come
back

  ill think about it thanks for the
introduction answered conroy who never
allowed his mission to run away with his
business sense

  so he went to new caledonia and jour-
neyed up to nakitalo in a disgustingly dirty
little boat which lurched and staggered in
the slightest swell for three days he was
too miserable to admire the scenery and the
smell of food appalled him the ever-
changing panorama of jagged yellow hills
sharply outlined against the blue sky and
the narrow green valleys where the graceful
coconut trees stood guard at the waters
edge failed to excite his interest

  once ashore at nakitalo however with
a fellow-australian to talk to he became as
self-assertive as ever mclaird impressed
him not at all for he was a little bald man
with very blue eyes set in a clean-shaven
weather-beaten face and his voice was low
and gentle in fact conroy tended to
assume command of the homestead and
hinted at a change of ownership

  well thatll be nice for you murmured
mclaird when he heard the news for the
first time

  nice-its a drop in the bucket my good
fellow retorted conroy a mere drop
youve probably worked on some of my
ranches around kalgoorie

  he named an imposing list of stations
extending over an area of some thousands
of miles

  your memory is still good sighed his
host without so much as a ghost of a smile in
his blue eyes

  those eyes at tirftes really annoyed con-
roy for they were unwavering and not in the
least abashed 

  otherwise everything went admirably
well mclaird provided him with a half-
caste boy from mare to act as interpreter
and turned him loose among the coastal
tribes who knew the value of money and
were quick to sense what the fat red man
wanted to know they told him beautiful
tales of oppression and cringed when they
mentioned the gendarme who administered
the district or mclaird who gave them em-
ployment they were sophisticated people
with a craving for contraband rum and
they retained few of their original customs
living in miserable hovels patterned after
the gendarmes fort-like house at the end of
the valley but conroy thought that it was
all magnificently primitive

  he filled several large note-books with
comments on native life and customs and
devoted a lot of space to the tribes economic
life as he paid the villagers five francs
an hour to talk to him of their grievances
they never failed to cluster about him when
he walked down the village street and took
his seat in the shade of a great banyan tree

  news spreads fast in the islands and be-
fore long in twos and threes men began to
drift down from the more remote villages
in the foot-hills to acquire some of the
fabulous wealth which was being poured
out by this red-faced man the newcomers
attracted conroys attention for they were
not dressed in the conventional blue loin-
cloth and open mesh singlet of the coastal
natives but wore strips of bark cloth
wound about their waists and carried queer
weapons

  the local people seemed to resent these
intrusions but always gave way in fright-
ened dismay when the hill-men appeared
at last they went to the hated gendarme
and begged for protection

  master they wailed the men of
vohlu are out again and we walk in terror


adventure

lest evil befall us our war-clubs are gones
and you are our father and mother

  and the gendarme who knew the treacher-
ous ways of the vohlus rudely broke up one
of conroys friendly meetings and marched
the visitors out of the village with orders to
leave their weapons at home next when they
visited nakitalo

  then the gendarme sought cut mclaird
who was busy breaking in a new saddle
horse for the next seasons round-up and
explained in explosive french that conroy
must not under any circumstances stir up
trouble between the villages it appeared
that he had given the people of nakitalo
less money than he had offered to the hill-
folk and things were not as quiet as they
might well be there was more drunken-
ness than was absolutely necessary and the
vohlu avere restless

  the gendarme wanted peace and quiet
in his district so did mclaird for the sake of
his bullocks but neither of them had taken
conroys mission into consideration he
was beside himself with indignation and bel-
lowed at the gendarme until the latter
bellowed back and the air rang with the
oaths of marseilles and the curses of unre-
generate kalgoorie mclaird sat on the
paddock fence and smoked cigarets until
the noise gradually subsided

  say he called to conroy in the same
dispassionate voice he used for all occasions
say mr conroy you dont own this place
yet i got to keep on friendly terms with
the gendarme so just cool off a little hes
quite right too i cant get any labor at all
since you started throwing money at the
natives talk to em all you like but dont
be so darned generous i need labor

  all right he added in halting french
for the benefit of the enraged gendarme
i will guard him tranquil comprenez
no more de le noise tres bien mon ami
oui

  the officer grinned good-naturedly as he
turned to go and waved his hands to express
hopeless disgust

  but conroy felt that his great mission
was being trampled upon he was being
forbidden free access to the natives by a
glorified policeman and a herder of cattle
who called sydney the big smoke and
couldnt lay claim to a bank-account
these ignorant men were afraid of him his
power his reputation

  no he shouted at mclaird i will not

be quiet i am going to finish my investi-
gation and i refuse ab-so-lu-te-iy refuse to
be deterred or coerced by you

 mclaird lighted another cigaret and
smiled his sunburned face creased and
wrinkled into a thousand little lines his
small teeth gleamed and his blue eyes
danced with merriment no man ever
before had dared to grin at conroy in a
temper

 laugh at me he spluttered laugh
at me-how dare you ill tell you what i
am going to do

  he was still explaining as the shadows
grew long and the sun slipped down the side
of a purple hill into the sea

  he was appalled at mclairds callous-
ness he declared he had seen enough to
convince him that everything had been
done or left undone to wreck the natives
standards and reduce them to slavery on
the morrow he would go up to the vohlu
territory and see for himself exactly how
these hill-people fared no doubt but con-
ditions were quite as bad up there

  he went to great lengths repeating him-
self several times to assure mclaird that
he might as well begin looking around for
a new job

  as a drover perhaps youll be a success
he snarled but youre incapable absolute-
ly incapable of holding such a responsible
position as this where the future of a race
lies in your hands

  mclaird finally broke his long silence

 come in to dinner food must be
getting cold he suggested as he jumped off
the fence and walked away with an indiffer-
ence which quite upset conroys calcula-
tions

 he followed dumbly choked by the
thousand things he still had to say

  after coffee had been served he launched
another -attack he leaned back in his chair
and eyed his host malevolently through
half-closed lids

  your silence leads me to believe- he
began

 thats enough snapped mclaird a
change had come over him his blue eyes
were cold and merciless and his mouth was
set in a thin hard line  ive put up with
you for a week as i said once before you
dont own this place yet remember that

  ive nursed you because youre out of
your depth as soon as you step off an as-
phalt pavement i wont bother to tell you
the naked truth



how wrong you are because its waste of
time but get this straight-you are not
going up-country tomorrow youd have
to have a permit from the gendarme he
wont give one to a maniac like you youre
dangerous youd either get killed or start
a rebellion thats not needed and i
wont let you have that interpreter or lend
you horses the sooner you pack up and
get out the better hospitality is wasted on
you go back to sydney and get control of
this place -before you come back theres
a launch going down tomorrow to mbopari
youll be able to shift for yourself there
conroy was amazed this little man
trying to bully him he smiled tolerantly
and blew a ring of cigar smoke toward the
ceiling no interpreter no horses-that
could easily be fixed the gendarmes
permit what did he care for that had
he not talked to some official at noumea
who had assured him that he could go any-
where he liked about the island

  without a word he left the table and
went out to the stockmens quarters where
he found the mare boy squatting at ease by
the door

  they whispered together for some min-
utes and a wad of notes changed hands
silencing the boys objections then he
went back to his room and slept soundly
he dreamed a little of his coming journey
through the hills and thought of the space
he would devote to it in his book

  at dawn carrying a heavy kit-bag he
tip-toed out of the house down through the
mist to the ford where he found the boy
awaiting him with two horses they lost
several precious minutes strapping the bag
in place and conroy cuffed his guide in his
hurry to be away he didnt want to be
stopped now at the very outset of his real
work at last when all was ready he swung
heavily into the saddle and cried out good-
naturedly-

  lead on apatwa my boy now we shall f
find our way to the truth

  he raised his riding-crop and pointed
ahead with a commanding gesture

   yassah dubiously answered the boy

 when we get back-

  conroy got no further for mclaird at a
run loomed out of the mist in his hand he
carried a murderous looking colt which he
leveled at the speaker

  come on conroy he ordered get
off that horse

  conroy hesitated and he came closer
come on he repeated get down
but for once in his life he was caught off
his guard conroy bending forward as if to
dismount suddenly brought down the butt
end of his heavy crop like a flail it glanced
off mclairds head and crashed on to his
shoulder he fell to the ground and rolled
over

  that muttered conroy will keep you
quiet for a while and he urged his horse
forward across the crumpled body

kassui chief of all the tiukas
owner of twelve wives squatted on
the sacred stone seat before the
mens sleeping-house and listened with wick-
ed eyes to the reports of his spies

  o chief said ngoroto a lean warrior
with hair bleached yellow after the fashion
of the lifou people-a proof that he had
traveled greatly i come from vohlu
they have grown fat and lazy once again
their men are weak and their women many
their pigs would gorge our ovens the
way lies open before us to the very heart of
their huts we ieed heads for the

shrine-

  go ari i know snapped kassui tugging
at his gray beard my sons new house
will need its attendant spirit and my fathers
soul calls for another slave

  for among the tiuka a dead man should
go in state to his heaven with an escort of
prisoners souls to wait on him and no house
is complete unless the skull of an enemy be
stuck upon the ridge-pole to ward off evil

  is that all you saw asked kassui after
a pause  the vohlu are close to the valley
and the white men lend them their magic
i am told

  ngroto laughed and spat scornfully
wah i watched for a week in the
shadow of their skull shrine on the hill they
no longer honor their dead and their magic

is harmless do i not know see-

  from his loin-cloth he produced a handful
of human teeth which he threw on the
ground before the chief

  the assembly swayed and shuddered
who knew what might not befall all were
not as strong as ngoroto to withstand evil
but an old man laughed shrilly and slapped
his shriveled thigh in derision

  o chief he cackled ngoroto is
strong already he has slain as many men
as i have toes on my feet he has much


adventure

honor among us-but he has no cunning

  the crowd shrank back as ngoroto arose
grasping his war-club but the old man still
squatted on the ground and nodded at
kassui he was ngorotos great-great-
uncle by marriage and no stripling may
strike such an one without losing his soul

  what is your tale old man grunted
kassui

  this- he answered while ngoroto
lurked by the deserted shrine i went down
into the village as one who comes in peace
have i not a woman of the vohlu in my
hut

   wahl yelled the assembly and the men
stamped their feet in approval here in-
deed was temerity worthy of a man of
tiuka

  and when i found my kin went on the
old man  i saw a very fat white man sitting
by their cooking-house i made inquiries
he is neither a bearer of magic nor a spy
but a fool who pays in the money of the
french to be told lies they sit about him
all day and receive notes for their talk
it is said these notes will buy many things
such as tobacco and cloth and rum-but
who knows the truth when a vohlu speaks

  how did he come among them asked
kassui

  he is said to love the vohlu he sought
them out alone for his guide fled when they
reached the first little hills  he says he is
the vohlus brother but they will surely kill
him when they need a sacrifice

  his head suddenly exclaimed kassui
shall go on my sons house and we shall
feast as we did of old

  he stepped from the sacred seat and hur-
ried out of the village up into the bush on
the steep hillside

  he has gone to talk to our fathers
whispered ngoroto

  war shrilly cackled the old man and
the assembly clapped and chanted while the
young men three deep around the throbbing
drums danced the eragi war-dance which
is dedicated to the ghosts of the ancestors
who have died in battle

  the call was heard from afar it was an-
swered from remote hillsides and from lost
villages there came warriors with their
clubs and spears elders with the hideous
masks of the secret lodges keepers of sacred
places naked and daubed with red ocher
all through the night and- all the following
day they drifted in gathering family by

family group by group until the tale was
complete and not a man missing

  there followed a great feast while the
elders took ghostly council at the shrine
beneath the banyan-tree and the drums
boomed incessantly then the elders re-
turned to the round-house and the tribes-
men in a hushed silence waited expectant-
ly just before dawn when the tree-tops
began to take shape kassui appeared in the
doorway in his hand he held aloft a
bundle-a wild taro to which had been
bound a tuft of the red wooly hair of the
flying fox and the broken shaft of a spear-
the sign of war shout upon shout filled
the air and the drums spoke with a new
voice as the young men stamped and swayed
to the measure which called all men to the
killing

  but war even among the hill-tribes of
new caledonia is a matter of preparation
spies must make sure that the path lies
clear ancestors must be propitiated and
omens be observed the spears the clubs
and the throwing stones must all be placed
for a second upon a certain carved rock
that the spirit of the original founder of
the tribe may enter into the weapons and
guide them swiftly on their way

  all went well with the tiuka the yam
harvest on the terraced hillsides was abun-
dant the warriors grew sleek and smooth-
skinned and the comer posts of kassuis
sons house were put in the ground the day
after his marriage for no woman needs a
home until her first child is born

  the young men grow restless an elder
at last told kassui all things are ready
we wait for a sign-

  aie answered the chief it has come

  and he sprinkled water over the fire in
the mens house the steam dissolved and
vanished before it reached the thatch proof
that the ancestors had accepted the liba-
tion and the old men began to chant until
the drums drowned their clamor

  that night the men of tiuka swarmed out
of their valley and dropped swiftly down
the rocky slope beyond dark bodies
gleamed here and there in the moonlight
occasionally a dislodged stone rattled from
ledge to ledge or a spear rasped against a
tree-trunk

 before the cool dawn wind rustled
through the palm leaves they reached the
outskirts of the vohlu village there fol-
lowed a rush and a yell and a scream
the naked truth



flames suddenly licked up the walls of a
hut a shower of sparks flew wide and
roof after roof caught fire by the red
glare the warriors swept through the
village and the vohlu died squealing for
mercy

  long before the morning mists left the
valley the village was reduced to ashes
where here and there a headless body
sprawled in the open and mr albert con-
roy the farseeing financier was being prod-
ded none too gently up and up and up the
mountain side through thorny bushes and
over sharp rocks in a hysterical voice he
cursed his captors for he was clad in red
morocco slippers and pink pa jamas which
were rapidly shredding and disappearing
as he clambered up the slope and he was
suffering acutely to make matters worse
he was herded with a score of vohlu pris-
oners and as many of their lamenting
women folk

  he fainted when the blazing sun beat
down on his unprotected neck and two other
captives were given the task of bearing him
throughout the day when he recovered he
lay face down in the dust before the sacred
stone where sat kassui some one had
thrown water over him and his hair hung
damply in his eyes

 wah grumbled the chief never
have i seen such fat on any man

  conroy sat up slowly gathering together
odd strips of pink cloth which had clung to
him to his journeys end in a wide circle
about him stood or squatted a crowd of
men blood-stained wild-eyed with great
head-dresses of cowrie shells and feathers
on the fringe of the crowd women hovered
watching him beyond the cluster of huts
he saw the towering forest-covered hills
penning him in

  a vohlu man with his arms bound tightly
behind him was thrust forward into the circle
and cringed before kassui

   what is this fat mans magic demanded
the chief

  great one i speak the truth seeking
mercy came the stammered answer his
magic is great he rules men of his own
kind by virtue of tokens which he gives to
those who serve him white men pay him
homage and one who lives near the coast at
nakitalo a powerful man indeed is said to
be his slave

  where are these tokens queried kassui
anxiously

  in his haste to seek favor the vohlu man
fell into the trap

  the tokens were burnt when his hut
was set on fire he answered

  can he create more

 who knows he had many with him
when he reached us

  then tell him that unless he produce two
fists full of such tokens he shall die and his
soul go to keep my sons house

  and shall i live

  tell him thundered kassui and the
circle of warriors narrowed in

  so the-prisoner made shift to explain the
order to conroy who understood not at all

  notes-or we die money french
money-or we die the captive repeated
again and again

  light dawned at last in conroys mind
and a great weight lifted from his heart
these people were not as dangerous as he
had been led to believe they dared not
kill him they were holding him for ran-
som

  money why my good fellow where
am i to get it if they will send a messen-
ger to nakitalo they will be given a thou-
sand francs also explain that unless i am
released forthwith i shall see that these
people are punished severely punished

i cannot imagine how-

  what does he say sharply queried
kassui is it a spell

  no spell great one but he cannot pro-
duce the tokens answered the vohlu man
if you send to nakitalo he says you will
be given tokens in handfuls for his release
for he is needed by his people more i
cannot understand

  make clear that unless the tokens appear
now he shall die when my sons house is
ready retorted kassui

  gradually conroy began to understand
he must produce money or die fear icy-
fingered clutched at his throat and he tried
to bluster and bully while kassui gnawed
at his beard and watched him with blood-
shot eyes

  he has no magic miserably repeated
the vohlu man may i be spared o
great one

  for answer the chief raised hisleft hand
and a half-dozen spears struck down the
shrieking captive as the warriors closed in
to the kill

  now conroy for all his vast experience
had never seen death violent death at such


adventure

close quarters street accidents he knew
and understood for he had seen an old man
knocked down and killed by an automobile
in the busiest district of sydney but he
could not face this ghastly horror with dis-
tended eyes and drooping jaw he watched
a warrior chop off the fallen mans head with
one blow of a bamboo knife saw them pick
up the body and bear it away heard the
clamor of the other captives and then
fainted dead away for the second time that
day

  thus he mercifully missed the great feast
which took place that night when the tiuka
ceremonially ate their victims to acquire
their soul substance and afterward danced
to the sound of the drums stopping fre-
quently that each man might recount his
deeds of bravery

tiie ensuing days however be-
came one long nightmare another
prisoner had been spared for a fu-
ture sacrifice and through him conroy dis-
covered how and when he was to die the
surviving captive had a gift for graphic
description and conroy was tortured by
visions of his own bleaching skull adorning
the new hut he vividly pictured the last
rite when he would be led out to his death
surrounded by frenzied tribesmen

  to his surprize he was not harshly
treated true he was kept under guard but
the tiukas even kassui provided him with
food and conversed with him through the
vohlu man when he spoke of his great
power in his distant home they grinned and
chuckled

  the man of vohlu at once resigned and
contented worked in the fields with his cap-
tors and took up a definite place in their
social system he was given a wife and a
hut of his own and lived apparently on the
best of terms with his neighbors

  his days were long before him he told
conroy for his soul would only be needed
when the taro season came around mean-
while he was happy he had food and shel-
ter and a woman death came to all men
to each his appointed hour

  conroy merely shuddered and glanced
fearfully at the hut which his soul was to
guard the whole tribe worked spasmodic-
ally at its construction for days it stood
untouched then a score of men would work
at it singing lustily while they lashed and
pounded and chopped conroy grew de-

pressed and frightened the remnants of
his pajamas and his slippers had long since
vanished and he went about clad in a strip
of bark cloth which a native woman
laughingly had thrown to him

  gone was his mission and his love for
primitive people gone his desire to help and
improve them in his mind he evolved
drastic disciplinary systems to curb and
check their barbarous ways the sword
and the bullet were mild when compared
to the methods he would advocate above
all things his soul revolted at their lack of
cleanliness and decency once he wit-
nessed an initiation ceremony which left
him gasping in horror

  when the crossbeams were put in place
on the fateful house he tried to escape only
to be caught as he stumbled heavily in the
darkness between the huts he incurred no
punishment for this offence except that
kassui spat at him and the women laughed
him to scorn at last however when the
singing workers began to thatch the hut and
the women were collecting fruit and food
for the coming feast conroy roused himself
from his dejected torpor he would not be
killed like a scared rabbit he told himself
he would make one last dash for freedom

  i cant die like this he repeated again
and again as he lay in the dark and listened
to the heavy breathing of his jailer

  late at night he became hysterical and
sobbed in great gulps the native stirred
restlessly in his sleep and conroy trembling
edged toward the dimly outlined doorway
his groping hand found the tiukas club
and his fingers closed around the smooth
handle

  crouching on his knees he raised the
weapon above his head but he had no
control over his muscles now his arms
refused to act he was shaking with terror

  i cant do it he whimpered i cant
do it oh god the last of my manhood has
gone the very last of my manhood

  tears streamed down his dirty cheeks as
he looked at the dark body barring his way

  still murmuring the last of my man-
hood he suddenly stiffened and brought
the club down on the sleepers head

  somehow he crept out of the village and
up through the bush as the dawn broke
he reached the crest and paused for breath
he was torn and bleeding and still sobbed as
he lashed the low bushes about him with
the blood-stained club
the naked truth

i

  away below him he heard faint cries
which reached him softened and mellowed
through the still morning air the man-
hunt had begun the clamor increased in
volume he caught sight of a dark body
leaping from rock to rock they were after
him already

  and ahead lay the sea placid and blue
and still he stumbled forward and began
to toil down the hillside falling and rolling
among the rocks crying aloud for help

mclaird sat with his feet cocked
up on the window-sill reading a
month-old copy of the sydney
bulletin the cigaret between his lips
glowed at regular intervals and unhurried
puffs of blue smoke emerged from his
nostrils curling slowly up into the hot still
air

  behind him at the table sat two heated
gentlemen in faultless white clothes who
glared at the back of his bald head and
fidgeted uncomfortably

  this is ridiculous one of them declared
mr shelburn and i demand your atten-
tion be kind enough to listen to me
mr thorpe is quite right assented his
companion you cannot refuse to answer
our questions

   well drawled mclaird its this
way you two have been here for a week
telling me about conroy and how much
money you lose if he dies ive been think-
ing about him too and what an almighty
beating up hell get if i ever meet him
now now admonished mr shelburn
no threats please the whole affair looks
bad enough as it is

  so youve said a good many times
pointed out mclaird  conroy disappears
im found with a dislocated collar-bone and
a bruised head so i must have murdered
him thats the idea isnt it

  im no lawyer answered mr shelburn

but on the face of it-

  rot snapped mclaird youre as
crazy as that nut conroy just hang about
here for a few hours until the gendarme
turns up and he will give you all the latest
news this business pleases him an awful
lot i should imagine having to run around
after a wild australian when he could be
writing nice reports or nursing his goats
dyou know he lets a whole bunch of em
stray into my fattening paddocks graft
thats what it is but hes not a bad lad

  mr thorpe helped himself to warm
brandy and set the bottle down on the table
with a crash

  i am not concerned with your absurd
troubles he exclaimed angrily mr con-
roy is urgently needed to complete the
plans for the australasian livestock cor-
poration he must be found if hes alive
we are losing hundreds of thousands
through this delay

   ive heard that before mclaird gently
reminded him my people in melbourne
told me to give you every assistance ive
tried to ive been doing nothing else ever
since i got out of bed and i want friend
conroy just as much as you do now leave
me alone until the gendarme gets here

  but- began mr shelburn

  mclaird turned and leveled his discon-
certing blue eyes at the speaker

  keep quiet he ordered and mr shel-
burn sat back limply with a dismayed look
on his face

  the gendarme arrived in the middle of
the afternoon tired and disgusted but he
had some information

  he had been up to the most remote vohlu
village which he had found burnt to the
ground he had not been told about it
earlier because the tribesmen wanted to hit
back at their enemies the attackers were
little-known people living beyond the pre-
cipitous slopes of mount ndoki they had
captured conroy and taken him away alive
so a survivor had told him

  this man should be put in prison if he
still lives grumbled the officer no per-
mit did he have from me no permission to
visit these people he should do twelve
months in noumea

  oui oki assented mclaird then he
translated the conversation for the benefit
of his guests

  an expedition- suggested mr shel-
burn

  and i shall have to ask for a squad of
soldiers went on the gendarme it will
ruin my districts reputation if i catch
this imbecile it will go hard with him

  here mclaird took command of the
situation

   im going up-country tomorrow hunting
for strayed cows ill have a look around
for conroy while im about it he told the
official and that worthy nodded his head
vigorously

  if his friend monsieur mclaird was fit


adventure

enough to undertake such a journey well
then he would accompany him perhaps
they could locate this crapule without out-
side help

  hes probably dead sighed mclaird
but well find out something definite
id have gone before but i couldnt move
my shoulder was too bad

  the gendarme was delighted here was a
chance of maintaining his districts good
standing on the morrow then at five
oclock he would call for mclaird to-
gether they would scour the country he
saluted and withdrew before either of con-
roys friends understood quite what was
happening when matters were explained
to them however they grew frantic de-
manding punitive expeditions reprisals and
detectives

  i protest against such methods cried
shelburn i want to register a most em-
phatic protest the proper authorities the
competent authorities should deal at once
with this matter

  it will take another three weeks before
any outside help can reach nakitalo an-
swered mclaird conroy was probably
killed the very day they caught him its
a certainty he wont be alive in another
month this is about our last chance and
its a mighty poor one

  then i insist that we accompany you on
this expedition said thorpe i want to
get to the bottom of this affair

  you want to come along grinned mc-
laird thats fine it will do you good
ill order a couple of horses for you at
once

neither thorpe nor shelburn
would have undertaken the next
days journey had they realized the
dangers they were called upon to face at
first they were rather pleased with the nov-
elty of the ride ahead in single file along
the shaded track all bordered with palms
and pines and silver-barked niaouli trees
went four native stockmen bareback on lean
australian cattle ponies then came shel-
burn on a high-stepping dun-colored mare
and thorpe fumbling at the bit of a rangy
seventeen-hand horse with a wicked under- 
lip behind rode mclaird and the gen-
darme wrangling as usual about the latters
pasture rights

  this quoth shelburn as they wound
along following the river bed is entrancing-

ly tropical the color of those hills-splen-
did

  he waved a well-kept hand at the tum-
bled mountains turned to gold by the rising
sun

  quite answered thorpe looking at his
horses ears which had a nasty habit of lying
flat back against his head as no good horses
should

  after lunch they reached the foot-hills
and left the narrowing valley for a
path which carried them up straight up
until shelburn looking downward called
back-

  i say thorpe this is trick riding

  thorpes answer was brief and incisive
but he kept his eyes straight ahead of him
and held his reins bunched in his left hand
for his horse exhibited a growing fondness
for grisly pas-seids neatly performed on
crumbling ledges overhanging dangerous
heights

  the next day when they attacked the real
mountains the track grew worse

  like riding over waves in a high sea
thought thorpe sawing at his horses now
bleeding mouth

  at last they reached the charred and de-
serted ruins of the vohlu village and camped
among the wind-blown ashes

  tomorrow said mclaird when they
had dined off corned beef and stale
bread well push along across that
crest

  he pointed to the frowning height just
ahead of them

  the gendarme thinks the raiders came
down that way theres said to be a big
tribe in the next valley but nobody knows
much about them

  are we in sufficient numbers asked
thorpe we might meet with opposi-
tion

  if we do just keep out of the way an-
swered mclaird we dont want any
more deaths in the family

  when they went forward the following
morning there was no track to follow on
foot leading their horses they clambered
up through dense undergrowth and around
boulders shelburns white riding-breeches
ripped open at the knee and he left a per-
fectly good leather legging hanging in some
particularly thorny bushes thorpe who
had come to fear his horse jerked savagely
at the bit when he found himself being left
behind his steed flattening back his ears
the naked truth



began to practise an intricate jig on what
seemed to be the worlds overhanging cor-
nice

  the others at last reached a rocky pla-
teau half-way up the mountain-side and
rode slowly forward beneath the pitiless
sun and thorpe cursed with a fluency and
directness which would have astonished his
more fortunate colleagues of the australian
livestock corporation sweating panting
and infuriated he reached level ground and
swung into the saddle after his horse had
danced and circled around for several min-
utes in his exasperation he did a very rash
thing-he used both his long nickel-plated
heavily roweled spurs and his horse bolted
headlong at right angles to the party taking
boulders and bushes in his sudden mad
rush

  by some miraculous intervention which
had nothing to do with good horsemanship
thorpe kept his seat and his wild cries
reached mclaird just before he was carried
out of sight behind a high clump of
bushes the party wheeled and followed
as best they could while shelburn closing
the cavalcade at a dignified trot kept
crying

  stop him oh stop him

the tiukas recaptured conroy
without trouble they found him
sprawling and exhausted at the foot
of a giant pine in fact at the moment he
was past caring what his fate might be he
wanted to lie flat on the ground and sleep
and rest so they bound and trussed him
hand and foot offered a prayer to the spirits
of the giant pine for having arrested the
captives flight and squatted down in the
shade for a while before bearing such a
weight back across the hills

  why not finish him here suggested a
young warrior who had only killed his first
man in the raid on the vohlus and had but
scant respect for traditions

  kah be still grunted one of his com-
panions he must be alive and whole for
the sacrifice strong and healthy otherwise
his soul would be weak and useless

  and i say it is better to kill while the
blood is hot retorted the young man
that is indeed a sacrifice but if kassui

wants this fat man-

  he arose and stood looking out toward the
distant sea thinking of the wives he would
have now that he had reached mans estate

  suddenly there came a thunder of hoofs
and cries

  look he yelled they come to his

rescue

  and all at once they saw heading straight
at them a group of charging horsemen led
by a demon who yelled with a wide open
mouth

  the young warrior paused to hurl a spear
a bullet caught him neatly in the chest as he
lunged forward and he went in state to the
land of his fathers dying with honor in the
heat of battle but his companions who
knew the ways of white men fled fled and
were engulfed beneath the thick under-
growth on the hillside

  the hurtling spear struck thorpes horse
full in the neck it halted reared and
crashed to the ground throwing its rider
into a tangle of low shrubs mclaird with
a smoking revolver in his hand helped him
to his feet	

  what a horse spluttered thorpe a
devil

  well youve got a long walk ahead of
you answered mclaird but what about
this black boy

  gendarme he added as the latter
rode up  what do you make of those
people

  tiukas replied the officer very much
out of breath many of them it is
strange let us go and see

  they found conroy shortly afterwards
quite naked very pink of body and very
red of face lying on his back on a bed of
pine-needles

  somebody gasped with astonishment
somebody chuckled somebody else mur-
mured-

  my lord what a beau-tiful baby and
they broke down and roared and laughed
until tears streamed from their eyes when
a pause came shelburn cackled

  hes so pink the dear boy and they
laughed again until they grew weak and
sore

  then they cut his thongs and listened to
his opinions of mankind while they gulped
and wiped their eyes

  there is little more to tell along george
street sydney where the financiers hold
court conroy is called the pink baby
but not to his face and he is apt to resent
any references to his tour of inspection of
the pacific islands which began and ended
in new caledonia he takes no interest


adventure

in people of ruder culture and has given nakitalo station where mclaird still lives
away his two books on native customs and raises fat bullocks what time he argues
moreover he has not bought up the with his friend the gendarme about goats

          was a day of peace and quiet
iy ckjj of beautiful sunshine and in-
q g tense heat wherefore the crew
f number one piece shot craps
in the shade of the gun-hield for matches
cigarets and their next month pay they
were not allowed to leave their gun per
order and they had been fighting the war
in the same manner for a week that is to
say they rolled bones all day and slept until
one oclock each morning when they would
all awake answer here and go back to
sleep again number four piece which
was off in the woods somewhere did all the
shooting for the battery about ten rounds a
night

  the gunner having made three passes
lighted one of his winnings and allowed
that it was a great war

  i will bet you said he my second
mess-kit of slum that there are no jerries
on the other side of the marne nor any-
where else in this sector here have we
sat and worn out our uniforms at the seat
for some seven or eight days and there is
a pile of tin cans back of the kitchen that

you can see in berlin and not a-shot

have we heard and not so much as seen a
balloon no wonder this war has gone on
for four years

  now there was one within hearing who
was shining the eye-pieces of his gas-mask
and cleaning a pistol and burning the end
of a piece of cork and he looked up at this

  look you now sheehan for the con-
nemara bog-trotter that you are i will
bet you a bottle of vin rooge which i gave
a frog my slicker for this very morning
against your syrup ration for the week
that there are huns across that river and
that i will bring one back for you to send
home to your girl more by token that the
old man has detailed me to go patrol this
very night with a wild crazy looey from the
doughboys a curse on him and all his and
i must go and prowl about in the wheat
with no hat on moreover and beyond i
must blacken my face with this cork so
that when i am dead no man will
know me and i shall fill an unknown
grave to the glory of some mail-order
officer

  with that he applied himself to the cork
once more

  you observers said sheehan lead a
hard life what with your meals brought to
you and every two nights in bed all night
and no rocket-guard to stand and i will
bet you my allowance of karo for the week
and if we have none then i will get a bottle
the patrol



of white mule for my extra pair of shoes and
bet that but i am not very like to lose

now when it began to grow dark
the observer gathered his pistol and
a short and husky knife to him and
walked out through the wheat field and
along a path to the road there was a sign
here that said gas alert and the observer
knew that it was just four hundred yards
from that sign to the machine-guns that
guarded the batteries flank which was the
reason for the signs being so then he went
on up the road and passed a cross-roads
where the signs said brownsville and dragon
fly and home run they being the names
of regimental or battalion headquarters
that were in that direction

  the observer looked off at the german
lines that were across the river and won-
dered whether any one was watching him
and thought that the sunset was gorgeous
and that the valley of the marne was quite
the most beautiful place that he had ever
seen he went on down a road bordered
by elms ancient and immemorial down into
a little town where every house had blanket-
ed windows and after following a line of
arrows went down into a cellar and reported
to the officer that he found there

  this one turned him over to a sergeant
who led him by a nice trench back of some
houses and through some gardens to a place
just under the railroad track where he
found some seven men hatless and each
with his face blackened and a look of dis-
quiet upon it like a child seeing the castor-
oil appear or a man on horseback who is
not quite sure of his seat

  i suppose said the observer seeing no
sign of any shoulder-bars that the officer
is still eating his supper perhaps the steak
was done a trifle too much or the potatoes
cold so shall we sit here and wait and the
american army suspend operations until
sears roebuck lias smoked his cigar

  we are waiting until it is dark said a
voice that seemed to come across miles of
snowy fields and glittering ice and the
observer looked and saw that he who spoke
had on a heavy gold ring of peculiar design
and then he knew that there was the officer
and that he was a real one and that it was
like to be a wild night

  now that the artillery is here give ear
to our plan said the icy voice we are
directed to cross this river and to bring back

a prisoner if we have to go to germany to
get him now we will cross in a boat which
has been provided and go straightway up
the bank in single file i will be in the lead
and each man shall hold the ankle of the
man in front of him as we crawl along
should i kick twice the signal will be passed
along the line and we will all execute right
into line each man with his bombs in his
hand and when i say now then let each
rush forward for the rest let every man
do as the man in front of him does any
questions

  i have no bombs said the observer

  it will be your duty said the officer
to locate machine-gun nests strong points
and trenches by the system of cartesian
coordinates and not to be throwing high
explosives around with an unpractised
hand this is once when the artillery will
not shoot up its own troops

  when it was dark the patrol crept over
the railroad track and down through the
wheat to the rivers edge it was damp and
cold and the observer was stricken with
chills and his teeth chattered and his body
shook like a leaf when they were getting
into the boat he nearly capsized it and had
he done so they were all dead for the other
bank was german and was but ten feet
away

  they lay under the shelter of the bank for
some time and then up and across a narrow
path into the wheat the artillery man
clinging for his life to a thick ankle now
this ankle belonged to a large rough man
by name gopher a tar heel and he was
a good man to cling to

  so they went on and ever and anon
stopped to listen and loud was the pounding
of their hearts the wind whistled through
the wheat and the observer wondered how
they would ever get back across the river
and the tears ran down the bridge of his
nose and tickled it so that he was hard put
to keep from sneezing

  now some one with few brains and much
curiosity found a rocket on the american
side and touched it off to see what would
happen at once every man with a very
pistol discharged it so that the bank on
both sides of the river was as bright as day

  the patrol lay without breathing but
cursing inwardly for they knew that they
must have worked either east or west and
were in front of troops that had not been
warned that there was a patrol out and by
 

adventure

the fact that the lights were almost over
them they knew they were not far from the
bank for all their crawling

  moreover the americans were having a
merry time with their machine-guns and
although the bullets were all going high
still it was not pleasant to hear the pounding
and see the wheat falling and dropping
around ones ears

  it came like a thunderbolt gopher
kicked the observer suddenly in the face
and he rushed forward without further
parley falling headlong into a shell-hole
there was a startled grunt and he saw
some one running off trailing a blanket
out pistol and a bullet away to the moon
the lieutenant kicking him vigorously and
cursing him to a fare-you-well and a free
fight going on under his nose the light
went out and darkness came that you could
taste much straining and cursing then a
thud and silence two husky whispers
proclaimed-

   ive got one of the illegitimates
   startled mutterings and-

  why i thought you was one of them
from two throats at once

  hot dog said a voice you got teeth
on you like a shark

  oh blessed day said the lieutenant
that ever i joined the army what an
aggregation of wooden heads and tipsy
soldiers you naughty naughty boys not
to know enough to be able to tell one another
apart from the enemy for the double-
cross compound triple-expansion nameless
brainless descendants of horrible ancestry
that you are blight me and strike me all
colors of the rimrocked rainbow if i ever
saw anything like it before and wild
west artillery here shooting off his pistol
right in front of the whole german army
by this and by that you ought to write the
kaiser a letter that you are going to call
now look at that- as a rocket curved up
behind them green and blue- fritz will
reap and sow and harrow this field with
artillery and machine-gun until the prince of
all evil himself wouldnt have it and after
all this commotion which was as much as
would be made by a division with trains
y m c a and all we have got no prisoner
and are like to be made some ourselves
not so said gopher for we have one
on whose head i now sit and i know that
he is a german for i can smell him

  now this prisoner was for the moment

quite still as gopher had felt him wiggle
and had wound the barrel of his pistol about
the germans head just over the ears in
his limp state then he was confided to the
care of gopher and another man called the
squarehead because no one knew his
real name the patrol coming from all over
the regiment

  if i find upon returning home that you
have lost my prisoner then shall you come
softly back and get another one and no
mistake now let us begone from this
shell-hole

so then they started the return
crawling single file as before with
gopher and the squarehead in the
middle with the prisoner and the rest with
their hearts in their throats there was no
artillery fire and few lights which meant
that the enemy had out patrols looking for
them and their hearts sank in consequence

  it was growing colder as the night ad-
vanced and the way back to the river
seemed overlong they hadbeen crawling
since the world began thought the artillery-
man and then he tried to think how long
it had taken them to come from the river
and it seemed to him that they were some-
what overlong on the homeward way

  the wheat stopped they were on the
edge of a road two cautious kicks and
the patrol rushed to the front at once they
were all among flower pots and crashing
glass lights going up everywhere machine-
guns pounding men rising up under foot
a dark shape jabbing at the artilleryman
with a bayonet a house with windows that
leered in the ghastly light from the flares
the lightning thought that the patrol was
lost and that it had crawled into chartreves
or jaulgonne

  the observer fled headlong into the wheat
for the infantry the task of fighting hand
to hand with angry huns two jumps
and he swan-dived in gorgeous style into
a shell-hole among a number of soft things

  you- said a soft whisper and the

artillerymans wind was at once shut off
with a hand of steel the while something
hard was slammed against his ribs

  let him up quoth another voice it
is one of our guys

  the three men dismounted from the
fourth ones head leaving him to gasp and
choke as best he might

  now said one resuming a conversation
the patrol



that had been interrupted get gone
and see that you lose not my prisoner
give me a gun and a couple of eggs and i
will see if i can not hold jerry in play a
while

  now all this time there was great thrash-
ing-about in the wheat and much muttering
in an unknown tongue so that it appeared
that the patrol would have scant chance to
get back to the river howbeit they eased
out by inches the observer the squarehead
and gopher going first with the precious
prisoner who was still in the land of nod
and the lieutenant bringing up the rear

  a long hiss and a faint plop the patrol
hugged the ground until the light would die
out six inches from the observers face
was a german looking at him with slack
jaw and goggling eyes both recoiled with
speed a cry a tearing grunt

  run like - and the artilleryman

sped toward the river toward the american
lines and toward spain and the african
coast

  had his wind lasted he would have been
on the edge of the sahara by daybreak
the flare still burned the officer was
standing up and was taking them as they
came until both guns were empty so died
a very gallant gentleman

  so long as one has his face toward the
enemy terror keeps at a distance let him
once turn let him feel that safety lies before
and that a bloodthirsty foe presses on his
heels that all is lost save his own neck
and a mans own fright will drive him on
when all danger of the enemy has long since
ceased

  the artilleryman ran at the top of his
speed he fell into shell-holes ancl scram-
bled out of them his breath came in sobs
he threw away his pistol belt and gas-
mask he wept he cared not the slightest
whether he was seen or not he took no
heed to the fact that all this banging and
yelling would arouse the whole sector and
that the americans would gaily shoot up
that wheat field until a mouse was not safe
in it so the providence that watches over
fools brought him safely to the river again

  there was a little path along the river
where aforetime youths and maidens were
wont to walk of an evening the observer
lay on his stomach on the far side of the
path trying to regain some of his wind and
to quiet the roaring in his ears the pound-
ing of his heart shook him like a leaf if

he tried to cross the path and swim the river
most likely the americans would lay down
a rain of steel and throw bombs and have
a most delightful time killing him

  if he called out that he was a friend jerry
would make a colander out of him from the
near side of the bank while he debated
with himself he heard a stealthy creeping
along the path and when he was like to die
from fear and horror he heard words and at
once knew that the creepers were americans
for they were both cursing a third to their
hearts content there is no more heart-
breaking thing than to have to swear at
some one in whispers

  gopher it was and the squarehead and
the prisoner who still slept

  he began to take on and squeak a while
back said gopher but i hung one on his
chin and he has held his peace the while
we dragged him around in the weeds by the
slack of his neck

  it seemed that gopher knew where there
was a machine-gun whose crew knew him
and it was his mind to crawl along until
they were opposite and then hurl his gas-
mask which had his name on it across the
river leaving the little book on which one
was supposed to write each time he used the
mask hanging outside on the book he
would write-

  throw us a rope and shoot like -

when you want us to come over

  this then was done the note was written
as best it could be in the dark and the three
started down-river dragging the jerry with
them they stayed in the wheat but not
so far in as to get themselves lost and well
it was that they did for they passed several
dark humpy things that they knew were
machine-guns with their crews lying along-
side in a hole

  anon they paused and gopher crept
down to the edge of the bank and gave a
mighty heave to his gas-mask they heard
it land

  shortly thereafter a length of rope
whistled through the air

  a flare went up at this and much banging
ensued it died down only to have the
whole american line leap into a long con-
tinuous pounding

  lets go and they were in the water
and scrambling through the reeds on the
other side

  eager hands dragged them under a little
foot bridge others pulled right lustily


adventure

on the rope which gopher had tied around
the prisoner and brought him over a little
damp but not spoiled a group of officers
arrived bringing a doctor excitement
hurried whispering cigarets hand-shaking
clapping on the back feeling of great pride
by the patrol visions of the d s c

  when said the doctor who was kneel-
ing over the prisoner was this man shot
he was not shot said gopher i
smote him as to the jaw

  not so said the medico and he
pointed to the blouse which he had
taken off all soaked with blood and

then to a small hole just over the prisoners
collar-bone

  it is in my mind that this hun was shot
earlier in the evening and laid aside to cool
for his wound has been dressed by unskilful
hands now whether that long ridge-run-
ning tar heel really heard him squeak or
thought he did is not material for it is very
certain that he has been plugged through
the lungs and has been dead some time for
he is quite cold

  whereat the survivors of the patrol being
but children of a larger growth after all
wept bitterly

the men who wouldnt be led

                      by wm l mallabar

             charlie got his in a barroom scrap
             somewhere north of the line

              tom was doped on the barbary coast

               jack was crushed in a mine

               there isnt one of the old gang left
               but me-and im nearly dead

               the last of the crew-the crowd i knew

              the men who wouldnt be led

               were not so bad when you figure us out

              we played the game pretty square

              we always shared the good-and the bad

               and treated the worst of them fair

               it was just a kink in our brains i guess

             that made us hate home and a bed

              we had to get out and travel about

              the men who wouldnt be led

               we have left our bones on the desert plains
               and up on the yukon trail

              we have faced big odds laughed at men and gods

               but you never saw one of us quail

               to us a flag is only a rag

               but we fought for the hand that fed

              for the game-won or lost no count of the cost

              the men who wouldnt be led

               up on a trestle or down in a mine

               on the veld-in the hills-through the snow

                we have followed our choosings a will-o-wisp fire

              all we knew was-it forced us to go

              and now i am going-that last shot was straight

             no name-unidentified dead

               oh the tales that well tell when we gather in hell-

   an un com pi im en tary empha-
sis distinguished the use of the
personal pronoun ed elsware
the speaker was a huge deep-chested man
of the pioneer type whose muscles bulged
conspicuously beneath his dirty khaki
clothes the queries he addressed to the
newcomers were short and pointed he was
looking over their physical qualifications
prior to assigning them to their jobs

  new york replied bob kingdon whose
apparel though now soiled and travel-
stained bespoke the man of culture

  n yawk hey commented elsware
with an unenthusiastic grunt i hed
some n yawk fellers on th job oncet or
twicet but they didnt stay long i never
yit seed one of em thet was willin t shake
hans wi hard work

   ill do the best i can was the reassuring
reply of kingdon who nevertheless had a
guilty consciousness that his acquaintance-
ship with hard work was likewise likely to
prove both short and uncongenial

   put this feller down fur th rock cut
directed elsware sourly to the camp clerk
well try im out thar

  kingdon and hard work soon became
acquainted high above him the jaws of a
deep rock-cut opened wide toward the
scorching sky below and about him
stretched piles of blasted rock newly torn by
an explosion from the face of a granite hill

snyawk and exsware copyright  by max bonier 

through which the men were cutting
around him two-score sweating bodies
strained at their toil they broke up the
huge pieces of blasted rock with heavy
sledges and loaded the fragments upon
dump cars preparatory to being drawn
away and dumped into the fill

  at intervals upon hearing the sharp
warning fire fire the workers would
leap for shelter behind jutting ledges of rock
while the dynamiter bulldozed a big
boulder this having been split into sec-
tions by the charge would be pounced upon
by the returning workmen and smashed
by the sledges into pieces small enough to
handle the hot air was filled with eter-
nally-circling black flies the steady clink of
hand-drills biting their way slowly through
hard granite and the ring of steel on steel as
the husky drillmen drove home their heavy
blows sweat was running into kingdons
eyes black flies were persistently lodging
in his eyes and nose and ears his soft hands
were cut and blistered from handling jagged
pieces of rock his back was aching alto-
gether he felt in no mood for manual toil

  i wonder how dante came to overlook
this he muttered this must be the
latest style in hells

  the new yorkers musings were swept
suddenly and rudely out of his mind how-
ever by the burly foreman of the rock cut
who thrust a ten-pound hammer into his
reluctant hands
o

adventure

  hi young feller he bawled threaten-
ingly take this sledge an git busy

 kingdon shamelessly spat upon his
blistered palms and began trying to wield
the heavy tool each time the hammer
struck its hard target a fresh shock was
registered on his tortured spine whenever
he would pause in his efforts and seek to
straighten the kinks out of his aching back
he seemed to see the foremans keen glance
fastened ominously on him when the
gang knocked off work kingdon walked
dejectedly to the bunk-house trying to de-
cide whether he was a hero martyr or
plain fool 

  night and repose brought a stiffening
of the muscles morning found him
scarcely more competent than a cripple
nevertheless he went unfalteringly to the
cut picked up the heavy hammer and began
a second days torture between the grim
rock walls the minutes crawled like
snails across the long day the inexorable
sun from a cloudless stronghold threw
vertical mid-summer shafts upon the toiling
forms beneath superheating the still air
that was filled with black flies and rock-dust
and the fumes of frequent blasts kingdon
strove manfully to perform the unaccus-
tomed labor but he could not help realizing
that toward him continually the suspicious
gaze of the foreman was being cast at
nightfall after he had eaten hissupper he
was suddenly confronted by the huge bulk of
the walking boss

  n yawk demanded the latter dis-
gustedly yu haint never worked on a
railroad-hev yu

  no to tell you the truth i havent
was the new yorkers ready and candid
response

  wal continued elsware sarcastically
th foreman tells me yu aint got no guts
fer th rock-termorrer yure a-goin in
th sand-cut

  morning found kingdon shoveling sand
with the sand-gang the job which con-
sisted of digging through a hill and loading
the sand upon dump-cars proved to be
somewhat easier than the slavery of the
rock-cut unfortunately however no
blasting went on in the sand cut conse-
quently there were no pauses in the labor
the shoveling was continuous ten hours
a day the routine was stoop and shovel
swat black flies stoop and shovel the
monotony was intolerable

  us blokes as got a - good boss

yank confided a fellow shoveler to
kingdon  e dont sy nothink hat all
that this was very true the new yorker
soon discovered but while the foreman of
the sand cut didnt say anything never-
theless his eyes proved to be even busier
than those of the rock foreman had been
all day long he maintained an attitude of
silent surveillance literally looking down
the mens collars and never even consider-
ately walking away for a minute to give
them a chance to straighten their backs

  all day kingdon stooped and shoveled
swatted black flies stooped and shoveled
he feared that he was beginning to contract
curvature of the spine all day long the
foremans eyes seemed to be drilling holes
in his shirt collar so he kept on stooping
and swatting and shoveling gradually
also there grew upon him an unaccountable
tendency to scratch he had heard some of
the men complaining of sand-fleas in their
blankets and therefore concluded that a
few of these pests had wormed their way
beneath his clothes nevertheless-to sat-
isfy himself upon this point which op-
pressed him with an increasing uneasiness-
after working hours he went to a secluded
spot in the forest and examined his under-
clothing

  fleas he muttered in amazement
if these be fleas where are their wings
suddenly the full horror of his plight
burst upon him with a shudder he ran
to the office and had his account charged
with new underclothes these he took
together with soap and towel to a tiny
lake that lay within gunshot of the camp

  good -- he groaned yale alum-
nus member of the exclusive yorkville
club and-getting lousy on a railroad job

  lightning flashed from the eyes
rlm of the big walking boss when he
sought kingdon after supper on the
following day

  blast yu n yawk he bellowed
th sand foreman tells me yure a-makin
trouble in his gang

  why mr elsware-

  thar haint no misters on this job
young feller yu haint in n yawk now
the new yorker dropped formality still
attempting to explain matters

    es torkin roight boss chimed in one
of the shovelmen standing near th

                  
n yawk and elsware



swede is mykin gyme of yank ere an

elsware glared the voluble cockney into
silence

 it jist happens this foreman is a swede
 hisself-thet lets yu in bad furtherso-
 more he tells me yu aint got much guts

job i kin give yu to see ef thars one-

thing yu onderstand about buildin a
railroad yu kin take out a hoss in th
mornin ef yu haint got nuff sense t

drive a hoss-

the walking boss glared at kingdon with
unutterable contempt and then swung
abruptly on his heel and strode away

what does he mean by take out a
horse inquired the new yorker curiously
of the cockney

stroike me pink if you avent it it
sorft yank exclaimed the shovelman
enviously nothink to do orl dy but
droive a-- orse

drive a dump car you mean

roight o mytey

 well to tell you the truth cockney ive
 never driven a horse in my life im game
 to try it though cant be much about it
 to learn ive often seen cabbies and coach-
 men do it

 bli me yank if you harent a funny un
 cawnt you do nothink hat all

lord no cockney grinned kingdon
ive just come out of a blasted college
the londoner stared scratching his
head almost incredulous

-ow did you appen to come hup to
this blinkin place yank	

got broke in montreal i wired the
dad for money to get back but he turned
me down served me right now ive
got to earn money to get back

on the following morning kingdon went
early to the stable and stepped gingerly
between the rows of breakfasting and
stamping beasts until he located the
stableman

 elsware told me to take out a horse he
 announced briefly

 wal yull hev t take ol dinnymite
 thar-hes th only hoss thet aint a-workin

dynamite echoed the new yorker
curiously what a name

 thet name jist suits im young feller

hes lybel t go off any time yu got t
handle im wi care

  ill be kind to him promised kingdon
hastily

  the stableman choking a queer sound
back into his throat well-nigh swallowed his
cud  of tobacco after dynamite had
broken his fast the harness was thrown upon
his back and he was led forth the animal
proved to be coal-black excepting his eyes
which glowed with a strange red fire

  giddap commanded kingdon firmly
after the manner of the city hack drivers
at the same time gently slapping the horses
flanks with the reins dynamite giddaped
at the same time pulling his driver after
him at headlong speed he giddapped
all the way to the rock-cut kingdon
with the reins wound firmly about his hands
served merely as a sort of rudder to steer
the speedy beast whose broad flanks for-
tunately for the man behind them broke
down or swept aside the impeding forest
undergrowths

  well hes obedient anyway gasped
kingdon trying to regain his breath and
picking the thorns and brambles out of his
clothes the fiery steed had paused at the
mouth of the cut-head held proudly high
and ruby eyes flashing-awaiting further
orders

  hook yur hoss on t this here kyar
young feller directed the foreman sharply
then go git yur load

  kingdon began maneuvering with dyna-
mites steering-gear in an effort to haul
his stern tackle to within hooking distance
of the dump car dynamites hoofs stac-
catoed nervously on the tow-path

  be keerful o thet hoss now warned
the foreman harshly hes been a-standin
in th stable too long

  giddap dynamite said kingdon cau-
tiously

  a hundred yards down the track was a
crossover this evidently did not enter
into the calculations of dynamite whose
private ideas on railroading seemed to
counsel him to proceed via the most direct
routes and ahead of schedule time

  hang on t thet hoss yelled the fore-
man frantically

  that was precisely what kingdon was
doing but his one hundred and seventy
pounds weight made little difference to
dynamite who utterly ignored the new
yorkers frantic signals to starboard his


adventure

helm and continued his fleet course un-
swervingly along the tow-path the car
left the rails at the crossover and landed
across the ties bringing the plunging horse
suddenly back upon his haunches

  yu blasted ijit didnt i tell yu t
hang on t th hoss shouted the foreman
wrathfully now my mens got t lose
time a-gittin yur kyar back on th rails
agin -- yu

  kingdons eyes flashed a slow rage
was fermenting in his bosom but he held
his peace half a dozen workmen straggled
leisurely over to the crossover and hoisted
the dump-car back upon the rails

  now give this feller a load directed

the foreman angrily give im a-big

load too-a load thetll take some o th
hellry outen thet black devil dinnymite

  dynamites sable hide however har-
bored much more hellry than the fore-
man was aware of the stout collar
strained against his broad chest as he
bowed his neck and tugged obediently at
the burden the heavy load of rock began
to move along the rails with gradually in-
creasing speed the rails led directly out
to the crest of the advancing wall of crushed
rock that was being thrown across the
neighboring valley this crest was called
the dump the terminating rails pro-
jected a few inches beyond the edge of the
dump and across their ends was bolted a
piece of heavy timber called the bumper
the modus opercmdi was as follows

  a dump-car was driven at a moderate
rate of speed to within a few yards of this
bumper the horse would then be pulled
sharply about automatically unhooking the
whiffletree chain from the car the car
would then proceed at its own momentum
until it struck the bumper the force of
such impact operating the mechanism
that dumped the load the horse would
then be rehooked to the dumped car and
the process repeated

  dynamite was quite familiar with the
details of this operation-much more so
in fact than was his driver whether the
powerful black had it in mind to show off
his capabilities before his new attendant or
whether his act was inspired by a pure love
of deviltry was a matter of individual
opinion at any rate notwithstanding
kingdons desperate attempts at control
the horse assumed complete charge of the
proceedings he pulled the heavily loaded

car toward the dump at full speed the
dismayed new yorker could hear the fore-
mans voice filling the air with shouts and
curses behind him but all the power of his
arms could not swerve dynamite from his
self-willed course ten yards from the
dump the horse turned sharply about and
unhooked himself with practised ease

  the speeding car struck hard against the
bumper and instantly dumped its contents
then with its momentum still urging it on
it turned completely over the obstacle and
crashed down the side of the hill of rock in a
series of somersaults until it landed bottom
up in the valley a hundred feet below
kingdon stood holding the reins with pal-
sied hands until dynamite scenting his
drivers confusion and helplessness took
advantage of the situation by galloping
away to freedom the whiffletree still
attached to the traces caught against a
stump and snapped in twain as the powerful
beast crashed his way through the forest

  kingdons ruin was complete the gang
from the rock cut came running excitedly
out to the dump curses and epithets
popped from the foremans mouth like
sparks from an anvil the new yorkers
face paled and his hands clenched as he
faced the foremans opprobrious attack

  even a worm will do it he muttered

  -yu wat yu drivin at howled

the foreman failing to understand the
danger signal

  you

 the new yorker struck a moment
later his persecutor was lying on his back on
the tow-path blood was flowing from his
nose the grimy crowd of workmen stood
silent gaping at the strange man from the
big city who had actually had the audacity
to strike a railroad gang foreman

  kingdon quickly left the amazed knot
of laborers clustering about their fallen
slave-driver he made his way angrily
back to the bunk-house it was there an
hour later that elsware found him

  git outen th camp yu- bellowed

the walking boss thar haint no money
a-comint yu git back t n yawk whar
th likes o yu belongs ef we counted 
fellers like yu t build this here railroad
wed never git it done in a million years

  elswares surly visage contracted into a
glare of mingled ferocity and contempt
he towered above the new yorker moun-
tainous and threatening kingdon knew
n yawk and elsware



that even one clumsy hug from this big
hulk of a man would have been almost as
deadly as- that of a grizzly bear but some-
how the new yorker was not afraid

  you great big ignoramus he roared
desperately you dont know one thing
in this world but rough stuff you might
be king out in these jungles and know it
all-but if i only had you in new
york-

  half an hour afterward kingdon was
striding swiftly along the trail toward the
south between him and the end of the
steel lay sixty miles of forest and granite
hills and muskeg from the end of the
steel it was still seven hundred miles to
new york he hadnt so much as a cent
in his pocket

  sent adrift into the wilderness he
muttered grimly because i dont know
how to build a blasted railroad 

j

the drowsy aftermath of carouse
was written unmistakably over this
mans gigantic person he was
standing in the center of a throng-standing
stock still as if anchored to the pavement
the massive head had sagged down into the
shirt collar the great shoulders were
canted sidewise like a listed ship it seemed
almost as if the giant were trying to person-
ate the leaning tower of pisa the awe-
struck spectators had ringed themselves
in a wide circle about the unusual spectacle
-wide because they evidently feared that
at any moment the tower-like legs might
give way

  teched

  the monosyllable rumbled suddenly and
sleepily out of the big mans mouth like a
distant growl from a sleeping volcano a
set of massive calloused fingers began list-
lessly and apparently half-consciously stray-
ing in and out of his various pockets

  hes been robbed came in hoarsely
whispered accents of understanding from
several of the bystanders

  a vigilant policeman hove in sight
drawing the legal bludgeon from it leathern
scabbard an imperative flourish of this
weapon opened a lane through the fast-
collecting crowd expectantly the on-
lookers looked from the center of attraction
to the officer he however scratched his
head in pardonable perplexity the job of
salvaging such a huge derelict bade fair to
be an unenviable one moreover he was

not exactly disturbing the peace in fact
he seemed on the other hand to be the
injured party in some shady transaction
this officer who liked an occasional tot
himself was loath to add to the big mans
misfortunes by making him a target of
legal discipline however he was un-
deniably obstructing traffic some sort of
action therefore became immediately neces-
sary

  whats your name where do you
live came out of the policeman in a
friendly growl

  teched grunted the stricken giant
dismally

  the policeman repeated the query which
elicited merely a dolorous repetition of the
barbarous word a strong liquory aura
invested the victims person

  huh charged up to the neck dont
even know your own name eh sum-
marized the law disgustedly dont any-
body know who this human elephant is

  he looked appealingly about the circle
of grinning countenances-sailors lumber-
jacks trappers railroad laborers-because
craig street at that time was asort of little
bowery where the rough-and-ready tribes
were accustomed to disport themselves
while in montreal it was shortly after
eleven oclock at night montreals curfew
for the bibulous rings at that hour pre-
cisely then the saloons doors are slammed
and locked the faucets are turned off and
the disciples of bacchus with such cargo
aboard as they have been able to acquire
find themselves in the cold and unin-
spiring street this was undoubtedly the
reason for the tipsy big mans appearance on
craig street some saloon lounger had
got his money-he had subsequently been
thrust into the street too bad the
law sighed he would have the job of
his life to haul such a monster to the nearest
call box

  just at that moment when the officer
was about to take a grip on his hesitation
and act in accordance with the letter of the
law-a young man pushed his way smil-
ingly forward

  sh he whispered its elsware the
big railroader i know him hes con-
siderably under the weather eh

  human nature is often a sheepy thing
the officer had never heard of elsware but
the well-bred-looking young mans cautious
implication generated the idea that here was


adventure

a big man of affairs whose foibles must
occasionally be winked at the policeman
smiled knowingly

  ill take him home volunteered the
stranger wait till i call a cab

  cab grinned the officer skeptically
why not a truck

  eventually however they stowed els-
wares ponderous frame away in a hack-
the task being accomplished through the
combined efforts of the law the affable
young stranger and the hack driver the
curious crowd began disappointedly dwind-
ling into the night the officer heaving a
sigh of relief sheathed his bludgeon and
continued his interrupted saunter through
montreals tenderloin the young stranger
climbed to the box and sat beside the
driver after which the hack proceeded east
through craig street elsware sat behind
in solitary and maudlin majesty his chin
drooping indolently upon his breast
teched he rumbled faintly

in and about the labyrinth of the
great grand central terminal from
lower level to upper level from upper
level back to lower level into the subways
mouth that growled constant subten-anean
thunders back through the interminable
network of corridors and into the vast
waiting-room-slowly dazedly dejectedly
a conspicuous figure of a man was making
his way he was a colossal specimen of
manhood standing easily six feet four
inches in his heavy shoes his eyes how-
ever held such a look of dismay as accorded
ill with his formidable mold at intervals
his hands fumbled nervously in his pockets
as if loath to abandon a search for some-
thing no longer there his demeanor was
so completely indicative of bewilderment
that at last he was accosted by a lynx-
eyed little man who had been observing
him for some time

  pardon me have you lost something
sir

  the giant turned sad and anxious eyes
upon the questioner

  reckon i hev young feller-reckon im
all lost-me an evrythin i got

  hows that dont you even know
where you are

  i dunno nuthin bout m self whar am
i at

  youre in the grand central station
replied the plain-clothes man beginning to

suspect that he had located a case of am-
nesia

  i knowed i wuz in a station all right
cuz some fellers put me offen a train this
mornin was the naive reply but
wat d yu call this here place

 the name of the city you mean
why new york of course

 n yawk

  the words shot out of the big fellows
mouth like the bang of a siege gun a new
terror leaped into his haggard eyes

 how furs it t muntreeyawl he
gasped

  between four and five hundred miles

  something like the last sigh of the dying
cyclops came out of the lost mans mouth

  who are you and where do you come
from persisted the detective

  im frum th north-names ed els-
war-i come t muntreeyawl fer a couple o
days good time yistiddy-leastaways i
think it wuz yistiddy-i hed two hundred
dollars wi me as furs i kin mind wat
happened some fellers teched me while i
wuz a-tryin t git hum i dont mind
nuthin arter thet till i got put offen th
train this mornin an now here i be--in
n yawk

  the plain clothes man smiled under-
standingly he had already lost interest
in the case which had turned out to be
nothing more exciting than the common or
barleycorn variety of amnesia

  i guess youd better get the air he
said meaningly

  jist wat im a-tryin t do mister
groaned elsware but durn me ef i kin git
outen this tarnation place nohow

  the sleuth laughingly piloted the big
man to the main entrance and at last saw
him swallowed up in the swirl of traffic on
forty-second street

  some hick he muttered

  elsware breasted the human billows as
far as fifth avenue pausing in consterna-
tion at the moving wall of vehicles that
barred his further progress the traffic
policeman suddenly lifted his hand and
presto a lane was miraculously provided
through which the ponderous railroader
nervously thrust his way at times square
he stopped in astonishment gaping at
great buildings that thrust themselves
fearlessly skyward looking in awe at the
tens of thousands of people who streamed
heedlessly along in six directions trembling
n yawk and elsware



at the frequent underground roarings that
poured upward through the subway grat-
ings beneath his feet as he wandered
aimlessly about the city he saw railroads
in every direction there were railroads
through the thoroughfares railroads in the
air over his head and railroads under his
feet

  elsware walked along the gayest prome-
nade in the world without receiving a sign
of recognition or a glance of friendliness
from a single one of all the thousands that
passed him by curious looks there were
aplenty drawn naturally in his direction
by his unusual size but alas he en-
countered never a welcoming grin or a
cheery bon jour or a howdy

  when night at last overtook him-the
weird metropolitan night with its hundreds
of thousands of lights stabbing the darkness
-elsware was sitting in herald square
listening dejectedly to the thunder of the
subways watching with awed eyes the
racing l express trains and marveling
at the never-ceasing clang and hum of the
trolleys

  dang me he sighed ef they haint
more railroads in this here n yawk than
they is in th hull dang province of quee-
bec

  the rugged railroad pioneer felt like an
ant with a sudden conception of the uni-
verse out in his own wilderness he was
king but here in this bedlam of sound and
scene and motion where they built up to
the sky and down for all he knew to the
infernal places where all his northern im-
portance and cocksureness seemed somehow
to have been cast by the board-why he
was nothing more than a drifting hulk of a
man headed irresistably for the rocks
where would he sleep his huge organ-
ism was already clamoring for food how
could he eat his brain was still hazy
from debauch and practical ideas for his
relief offered themselves very slowly how
could he get back to the job he hadnt
even the price of a telegram to his em-
ployers so that he migh ask for a loan of
money how did men go about these

things when they had neither money nor
friends and were adrift in the great wilder-
ness of new york

  elsware groaned at that moment a
well-dressed young man nonchalantly puf-
fing a cigaret after the manner of his kind
seated himself upon the bench beside the
despondent derelict

  elsware he said evenly about four
months ago you chased me out of your
camp-without a nickel-because i didnt
know anything about building a railroad
how i ever got back to the steel is a night-
mare- dont remember half what i suf-
fered on the way at last when i was
nearly all in i landed a job in the chief
constructing engineers office at the end of
the steel saved six hundred dollars in four
months so you see elsware i know some-
thing about building a railroad after all

  i was on my way to new york when i
saw you last night on craig street ill say
you needed a friend i took you away
from a cop finally got you to the station
hired a porter and the cabby to help me
hoist you into the smoker shoved a ticket
into your hat-band and let you snooze
ive been tagging you around all day en-
joying myself

  n yawk exclaimed the unfortunate
railroader with a glance of piteous appeal
from his haggard eyes yu be nt a-goin
t git even wi me now fer wat i done t

the first part of the story briefly retold in story form

n the banks of the benin river in the niger
delta were sprawled the buildings of marsden
 cos trading-factory across the way stood the
decrepit establishment of the only rival in the
vicinity which belonged to bart jardine and his
daughter a distance down-stream rotted what was
left of a concern once known as grandisons and it
was to this latter beach that charteris a man with
silvery hair and the face of a youth came appearing
no one knew why or whence

  at the same time hugh morrison owner of mars-
den  co arrived in his yacht with his daughters
and servants to look over his agency and investigate
the circumstances surrounding a disturbing quarrel
between two important native traders agwala and
abado his visit had not lasted more than a few
days when one pitchy night as he paced the deck
of his boat mr morrison was done to death by a
mysterious assailant and immediately the neigh-
borhood of whites and blacks was thrown into an
uproar every effort was made to determine the
murderer and during the proceedings of inquiry
suspicion fell upon every one from the puzzling
stranger charteris to noni margaret jardines
negro maid and next abado-who had incontinently
vanished during the confusion but even mor-
risons youngest daughter elsie was subjected toa
grilling and it was her nervousness and bewilder-

onsidering how disagreeably
distant and reticent he had
been all day the great dane
astonished catherine not a little
by inveigling her into the semi-privacy of
the library apparently he had something
secret and important to say to her and she
had all the sensations of walking on tiptoe
as she accepted his invitation

  im afraid ive got to be unpleasant

   the cray charteris copyright  by robert simpson

ment that created a new air of suspicion and served
to complicate the whole affair all the more

the examination continued but little light was
thrown on the situation gradually however
there grew up a feeling that the gray man knew
more than he cared to tell and it increased when
mysterious goings-on at grandisons beach were
reported word was brought that charteris was
sheltering abado there-a fact which naturally
pointed to a double implication in the recent
murder

  mr parker the government commissioner and
all those associated with marsden  co concen-
trated their efforts toward verifying the rumor and
then apprehending abado they solicited the help
of agwala who was only too pleased to comply
charteris however having other plans in mind
managed to keep them all guessing thereupon
mr parker decided to use force as a last resort and
set about preparations for an armed visit to
grandisons

  meanwhile the trade at marsden  co com-
menced falling off on the other hand there was
a sudden flurry of trade at bart jardines across
the way and this phenomenon was strange
enough to appear importantly connected with the
already unpleasant tangle of events

he said when they had made themselves
comfortable

  any more so than you have been since
you arrived this morning

 much

  parker liked catherines fighting face
it was good to order a woman like that
around

  you see there isnt any valid reason
why you should stay here and- 


the gray charteris



  im not going i wont go until this
whole business is cleaned up

  things like this take time and moping
around on these rivers isnt a bit healthful
fiddlesticks if margaret jardine has
lived on the hulk for over a year elsie and
fran and i can surely live on the bonny for
a month or two besides it mustnt take
that long why dont you do something
instead of just looking terribly wise
parker laughed

  then well have to move you down to
forcados its cooler down there

  you wont do anything of the sort you
can move the yacht if you want to but ill
go and live at sandy macgregors

  cant do that its against the law
catherine paused searched parkers face
for a hint of humor and found none

  you are not really serious about this
are you

  very

  immediately

  in a day or so

 why

  i think you would all be much better off
at forcados

  you dont mean that at all catherine
accused if we can stay at forcados we
can stay here unless- what is it you
are really afraid of

  simply that benin river is a bit upset
and may become a trifle more so
fighting

  there was an eagerness in catherines
voice that for a sabbath evening was sacri-
legious

  no i think not parker prevaricated
guiltily

  again catherine hesitated biting her lips
reflectively it was one thing to be defiant
and quite another to make good her de-
fiance

  parker waited a minute or so asked if he
might smoke lighted a cigaret and then
allowed a warri policeman to scuff past
one of the library doors before he spoke
again

  and in the interval catherines mood
changed

  i wish you would let me advise you in
this parker began in a friendly voice and
suddenly became uncomfortably aware of
catherines eyes

  she smiled quietly and tolerantly and he
felt somewhat foolish

  please dont mince matters she said

and her voice pleaded a little im not
afraid of any kind of truth provided its
true youre just tired of us

  no-i assure you-i have enjoyed-

  you have not softly we cramp
your freedom of action-get in your way-
ask stupid questions-make you say dash
when you want to say damn and all that
tommyrot youre not comfortable and
youve either made a terrible mistake in us
or youre simply and bluntly fed up
parker rose crunched his cigaret in an
ash receiver and catherine had no difficulty
in observing that the operation was a vi-
cious one she calmly retained her seat
however and while he fumbled about for
something to say she added with a gentle
note of disappointment

  i shouldnt blame you a bit if you would
say so and be done with it but i do most
heartily object to a man pretending to be
considering my welfare when hes really
thinking of his own

  parkers jaws snapped and bulged and
for a moment or two catherine detected
the man beneath she liked that man part-
ly because she was afraid of him but greatly
because he did not attempt to apologize or
argue or meet the situation above a con-
versational level

  while she clothed her anxiety in an
assumption of gentle resignation and did
not for a moment allow parker to escape
the discomfiting attention of her eyes he
said simply-

  in that case there does not seem to be
anything more to say

  no i suppose not except to decide
our sailing date

  you can discuss that with captain
walton

  yes but when

  at your own discretion he said and
catherine admitted that his self-control
was worth watching however i should
advise you to get under way by the first of
the month

  catherine hastily consulted the small
desk calendar the first of the month was
eleven days off much could happen in
eleven days including the possibility that
she would be able to induce the great dane
to change his mind again

  all right thanks im sorry weve
bothered you and-and ill try not to ask
any more questions

  that will help parker said with all


adventure

the agreeable effect of a straight right be-
tween the eyes please ask malkett to
come in-no dont bother ill-

  its all right catherine interposed
sweetly im only too glad to help even
if its simply as an office girl

 oh-

  catherine halted with her fingers on the
knob of the screen door

  thank you she said gratefully that
assures me that you think im almost grown
up then softly good night commis-
sioner

  catherine went out leaving parker to dis-
color the atmosphere in the library as
savagely as he pleased and with a doubtful
smile of triumph hugging the corners of
her mouth she searched for malkett

  captain walton and he had joined
hogmanay and margaret but fran was
standing beside the rail looking up-river
catherine did not see her at first but hav-
ing delivered the great danes message to
malkett she looked about then moved
across the deck

  frans arm now lay along the rail and her
forehead rested upon it apparently she
did not hear catherines step until she came
very near to her then she lifted her head
sharply and spun about in startled inquiry
there was also a haunting guilt in her eyes
that catherine did not see clearly enough to
enable her to detect it

  whats up fran demanded impa-
tiently

  nothing quietly got a headache

  one of the buzzing kind fran returned
and suddenly decided to be pleasant about
it bees and bees and bees itll be gone
in the morning what did parker have to

say to you ponderous words of eternal
devotion i suppose in the guise of official
business

  no sourly were to get out by the
first

  and hes been making sneaky goo-goo
eyes at you all day

  has he i hadnt noticed dont you
think youd better toddle to bed

  and catherine took a gentle but firm hold
of frans wrist

  rot fran snatched her wrist out
of catherines grasp with a sharp jerk
youre not going to make an interesting
pathological study out of me go over there
and take macgregors temperature if he
had a clinical thermometer under his tongue
this minute the picture would be complete
catherine looked and smiled warmly
fran laughed and the sound struck a new
note in her life a note even catherine did
not suspect or understand also fran did
not have a headache nor just then was
she giving a great deal of thought to her eyes

  are you really going to leave on the
first she asked and seemed a little anxious
not if i can help it

  then theres nothing to worry about
fran declared confidently and drew a long
silent breath of relief

next morning catherine received
another cable from her mother
and cable-like it did not squander
words therefore catherines anxiety for
the sort of action that was wholly visible
and understandable increased feverishly
with every hour

  she met the great danes morning-after
tendency to be pleasant with a saccharine
humility that was somewhat thin and
ragged in spots and when parker or mal-
kett were not looking she became suddenly
attentive to arthur garriman bark

  obviously bark did not like the questions
she asked he appeared to be afraid of
them and in the evening when catherine
told him blandly that she expected char-
teris to visit the yacht in an hour or so
arthurs confusion became most manifest
shortly after nine oclock he disappeared

  in the interval catherine held a long and
persuasive conversation with andy gra-
ham the chief engineer andy said no
and shook his head most of the time but
finally he nodded in a slow cautious way
that did not commit him too much
the gray charteris



  and shortly before ten oclock catherine
announced that she was going over to
hogmanays to talk over and have him
send the reply to her mothers cable

  oddly enough she did not ask fran to
accompany her and andy graham was in
charge of the bonnys launch when she
reached the foot of the companion ladder

  the launch started off in the direction
of marsden cos wharf then about half-
way swerved sharply in the pitch black
dark and shot up-river

chapter xvii

abduction

in the flickering light of a small kerosene
lamp charteris squatted upon his little
pile of blankets in his corner of grandisons
erstwhile office and smoked and talked
sonorously to abado who paced up and
down in impatient restlessness hurling an
occasional staccato curse at agwalas an-
cestry

  abados state of mind was chaotic not
because for the time being he was not
perfectly safe simply that charteris put
an awkward and galling restraint upon his
impulse to do rather than to wait

  in the bush round about were many eyes
that watched every moment of the day and
night they belonged to abados sons or
his hirelings and at the first hint of danger
the sobo slithered to cover by the simple
process of vanishing into the bush

  when the danger departed he returned
to the shelter of the gray mans protection
which was as complete as it was beneficent
neither the government nor agwala seemed
at all eager to interfere with him

  nevertheless abado was not happy
despite the promises charteris was at that
moment making and when ogulo suddenly
projected himself into the room with the
rather tiresome announcement - gov-
ment come--abado whined like a child
whose patience with authority is on the
verge of exhaustion

  go to back beach bush charteris
ordered sharply we go dowadda when
govment go way

  abado muttered under his breath but
obediently vanished like a wraith and ogulo
followed him down the galley stairs

  charteris did not leave his corner
quickly dropping his mosquito curtain and

composing himself as comfortably as possi-
ble behind it he gave every appearance of
having gone off to sleep

  his position furnished him the advantage
of seeing without being seen and when foot-
steps sounded on the stairs he knew that
malkett or parker or whoever it was had
not come alone

  and then charteris smiled a wisp-like
smile that almost became a laugh

  anybuddy at home andy graham
queried doubtfully from the doorway

  catherine was directly behind him look-
ing inquiringly over his shoulder and her
expression was that of one who is trying to
be just politely interested in waiting for the
performance to begin she was thankful
however that she wore skirts otherwise
her tell-tale knees might have told a more
nervous story

  charteris yawned audibly

  whats that whos there

  and then before any one could answer he
thrust back the mosquito curtains and
looked out

 oh that you graham and miss
morrison

  he scrambled to his feet rubbing his eyes
i must have dozed off this is splendid
of you a most unexpected pleasure if
i had known it was coming off i should cer-
tainly have become possessed of a chair
may i however invite you to squat
those blankets-but perhaps you would
rather stand

  catherine laughed at the queer look of
horror on andy grahams face

  no ill squat she decided and
promptly became enthroned in charteris
corner but what are you going to do if i
use up all of the blankets

  squat lower and look worshipful
whats wrong graham where are you
going

  ill go and sit on the stairs andy ad-
vised moving toward the door yell find
me there if ye want me

  charteris looked pointedly at catherine
as andy went out then seated himself on
the floor

  he didnt think of that all by himself
did he he asked mildly

  no-not altogether

  then this isnt a social call

  ladies do not pay social calls after ten
oclock at night not even on the benin
river


adventure

  quite true they dont er-if i may
smoke theres a tin of cigarets almost at
your elbow will you be so good as to cb uck
them over to me please also the matches
but be careful you dont cut yourself on
that knife

  the hausa dagger etaji had unwillingly
left behind him was some distance from the
cigarets catherine probably would not
have noticed it if charteris had not made
known its existence

  whether he knew this or not or whether
he was simply taking a roundabout method
to put a weapon into bter hand if she
thought even vaguely that she needed the
comforting assurance of a ready defense
catherine did not know her color height-
ened just a little however as she chucked
the cigarets and matches at her host then
she picked up the knife

  its an ugly thing she commented
horribly business like

  it wasnt made for sharpening pencils
charteris admitted contentedly exhaling
cigaret smoke you may have it as a me-
mento of this frankly improper call im
sure its former owner would be glad to
think it was in your possession

  thanks i think id like to have it
who did you take it from some one who
tried to use it properly

  charteris glanced toward the door and
beyond it into the fire-fly-dotted blackness
toward the river he did not seem to think
that catherines question required an
answer

  what did you come to see me about
he asked suddenly but catherine was in no
wise flustered by it

  because ive become conviced that you
know a great deal more about my fathers
death than you pretend to she said with
unfaltering directness

  i

  bark is afraid of you catherine went
on steadily and when agwala came to the
yacht the other day he told mr parker in
my presence that you were interfering or
likely to interfere with justice

  great scott

  catherine studied his astonishment try-
ing to find a flaw in it then quietly
deliberately measuring each word she
added-

  he said in short that you were-shel-
tering abado

  charteris threw his head back and

laughed even his eyes joined in appar-
ently the accusation was too funny for
words then when he found himself able
to be serious again he asked

  sure you are not mixing me up with
some one else

  catherine had a sinking feeling even
though she heard andy graham cough
every now and then she felt terribly alone-
futile-circling about an impenetrable wall
with a hair-pin for a battering-ram

   you are the gray man arent you she
asked as if there might be some doubt
about it

  im gray enough if that constitutes
identification

  then agwala meant you also when
bark came up here the other evening and
reported you absent im sure he knew you
were not here or else he would not have
come up

   charteris smiled unbelievingly

  what on earth makes you think that
it isnt my thought exactly fran-
miss goddard you know-put it into my
head said she had had an ocular demon-
stration of barks fear of you so to-day
i watched him quizzed him frankly both-
ered him about you and became convinced
that fran was right the man actually
jumped when i told him that i expected you
to call this evening and he at once left the
bonny for an unknown destination

  again charteris laughed

  that wasnt quite fair what might i
ask did parker say when agwala accused
me of throwing a monkey wrench into the
laws machinery

  oh he just told him he was talking
rubbish or something to that effect but
i dont altogether believe it so im
here

   i see quietly and flipping his cigaret
through the open door frankly i did not
expect to see you occupying that corner
i appreciate the honor keenly graham
a trusted confidant of yours

  catherines heightened color was per-
ceptible this time she glanced quickly
down at the knife in her lap gingerly fin-
gered the edge of it then put it aside with
an involuntary shudder

  ive known andy for years and ive
never known him to betray a confidence
dad trusted him implicitly and dad knew
men

  charteris nodded
the gray charteris



  no one other than graham knows you
are here tonight

catherine looked just a little startled
why do you ask that she questioned
cautiously and felt for the first time that
she was farther away from the yacht than
she had any right to be

  charteris picked up the cigaret tin and
the matches and rose his movements
were leisurely but deliberate

  then youd better get back before any
one finds it out he said simply be-
cause of course there is really nothing i can
do for you

  catherine stared her cheeks flamed
she felt like a very little girl who was being
sent home because her conduct had not been
good her eyes lighted up angrily

  im not a child she began not at all
aware of the impulsiveness of her speech
and i didnt go to all the bother of induc-
ing andy graham to bring me up here sim-
ply to go away again without coming to
some sort of understanding about your po-
sition in this terrible affair malkett of
the police agrees with mr parker that
agwala was talking nonsense but i
dont

  no

  no i dont the government officials-
and sandy macgregor too for that
matter-know too much about this country
to believe that a white man would shield
a black one in a case of this sort i dont
know anything about it so i am not allow-
ing prejudice to interfere with my ideas
about things

  there is something in that charteris
admitted pleasantly and im afraid i
shall have to talk to agwala in plain
language for trying to ruin my spotless
reputation but before you further im-
peril yours i shall have to send you home
youre altogether too desirable to be wan-
defing around in the dark like this

  catherines expression declared that she
did not know whether to be angry or sur-
prized or suspicious or all three at once
so she compromised by laughing softly and
rising lightly to her feet

thats just make believe she decided
you want to get rid of me and are trying
to scare me off i didnt come here alone
no but there is a back door as well as
a front door to this establishment

  catherine paused the stillness that
gripped the place had a smothering effect

there was a queer hint of stifled laughter
in the air she loitered a few steps nearer
to the door

  i wish you would be frank with me
she said simply as though his veiled threats
were not worthy of any consideration i
have been brutally frank with you because
i think you can help me to-to discover the
man who did it and i wont leave the
country till i do i had another cable from
mother this morning too

  what does miss goddard think about
it

  fran oh she- catherine stopped
why is that important you know per-
fectly well you irritate her simply because
she cant hurt you

  charteris glanced along the veranda to
where the shadowy outline of andy graham
was wrapped in a furious cloud of pipe
smoke then he moved out of the doorway
into the room again giving catherine an
opportunity to run if she wanted to

  you forgot the knife shall i get it for
you or would you prefer to get it your-
self

  nothing could have been plainer to cath-
erine than that the way to the door was
clear and he gave her permission to possess
herself of the ugly hausa dagger to make
sure that the way remained clear her
color drifted and her mouth became a severe
line there was something of hugh morri-
son in her face then

  she walked suddenly toward charteris
and there was not the slightest sign of fear
in her eyes when she halted he could have
touched her with his outstretched hand

  ive come up here because i believed-
and still believe-that you really know more
about the inner workings of native intrigue
than malkett and macgregor and parker
and all the rest of them put together
thank you

  and i thought you would be man enough
to help a white woman when she needed
help very badly you see i dont believe in
playing with words or facts nor have i any
intention of getting down on my knees
no dont do that

  and im not going to be frightened or
driven out of the river one minute sooner
than i want to go

  i hope not i like to see the bonny
lying out in midstream when the sun comes
up reminds me of lots of things-includ-
ing cream puffs and white icing cakes


adventure

  his hands reached out quickly and caught
catherines wrists she gasped drew back
a step stopped because she had to-but did
not scream charteris knew she was trem-
bling but her eyes did not show it

  the sound of andy graham coughing had
no effect upon the situation except to relieve
the outer darkness a trifle a moment later
it was blacker and more silent than ever
catherine asked with just the suggestion of
a sneer-

  this is my cue to yell i suppose

  not unless you want to frankly i
dont believe you do want to

  his hands slipped up her arms to her
elbows and catherine pulled her head back
sharply

  dont this is just cheap dramatics
or more trifling please let me go

  charteris shoulders ceased to lean
against the wall he drew her a little nearer

  you know theres a whole lot to be said
in favor of taking advantage of ones oppor-
tunities and if you refuse to use the voice
the lord gave you whats a mere man to
think you arent even restless

catherine tried to draw away from him
rubbish she exclaimed disparagingly
but her voice sounded weak and uncon-
vincing this is all bosh please let me
go dont

  charteris hands had reached-her shoul-
ders in a twinkling and she found in another
moment that she was being held very
firmly in his arms his face a scant few
inches above her own yet she did not
scream she was in -point of fact afraid
and ashamed to admit to andy graham
that her secret adventure had been a mis-
take

  youre hurting me she said quietly
trying with all her might not to look
frightened while she shrank from the queer
cold laughing blue of his eyes

  im sorry softly but i understand
that even the nicest ladies like to be knocked
about a bit in fact i think they prefer to
be carted off bodily

  his left hand curled about her neck and
slipped over her mouth without a seconds
warning stifling her involuntary cry of fear
so that it was nothing more than a choking
gurgle in her throat

  before she fully realized that it was possi-
ble that such a thing could happen to her
charteris was half way down the rickety
galley stairs and she was being carted off

bodily as if she were no more trouble than
an infant

  the arms that held her captive were sure
and strong and without mercy the hand
that was clapped across her mouth was by
no means gentle she could not use even
her teeth to bite her voices way to free-
dom

  so that the experience hurt as well as
outraged and going down the galley stairs
catherine had a moment  two in which to
realize her predicament because it was
dangerous to struggle then

  at the foot however she leaped in char-
teris arms like a wild thing leaped and
kicked and tried to tear her head out of the
clamping grip of his left hand the result
was simply a tightening of that grip-a
crushing sense of helplessness-a groping
in the dark of unbelief as she gathered her-
self together for another strenuous bid for
freedom

  she could not see very well where they
were going but presently she heard char-
teris say softly

  this is really exciting wonder what
poor old graham will say when he finds it
out hope he doesnt take it too much to
hert and shoot himself or something like
that

  again and more furiously this time cath-
erine twisted and lunged and tried to tear
his hand from her mouth then she struck
at him but her blows fell short and broke
their strength upon his shoulder hurting
her knuckles more than they did his shoul-
der-blade

  presently out of the storm came char-
teris voice smoothly

  a perfect conclusion to a wonderful
evening what a pity it isnt real

  and then he suddenly stood her upon her
feet saw that she preserved her equilibrium
and stood off a pace blandly watching her
amazement

  she was standing on the gig-wharf

chapter xviii

the bulge in the screen

t told you there was a back door
charteris said pleasantly then after
a short and heavy pause shall i call
graham or would you prefer to make your
own explanations

  catherine leaned against the wharf rail
the gray charteris



in absolute silence her mouth hurt her
breath came hardly and she was trembling
in the grip of a reaction that was almost as
terrifying as the imprisonment of charteriss
arms

  speech was beyond her but she felt so
inconsequent and so utterly foolish that
nothing at all mattered very much had
charteris laughed at her perhaps she would
have liked it better but he was so irritat-
ingly pleasant and sympathetic that even
the incessant hum of mosquitoes about her
ears did not disturb her

  she looked down into the bonnys launch
that was tied up to the wharf smothered
a somewhat hysterical sob of anger that
was mixed with an odd kind of disappoint-
ment then with a tremendous effort her
aching body straightened and she said in
a voice that though it hesitated a little for
want of breath was almost normal-

  i suppose that was your way of proving
to me that it isnt wise to be too sure of any-
thing or any one

  perhaps but ill admit you were a
violent burden elsie-thats your sisters
name isnt it-would be lighter and more
tractable than you i imagine

  catherine swallowed once or twice and
then decided to ignore his reference to elsie

  it was also your way of saying definitely
that you wont take sides with me that
you would rather id go away and not
bother you

  good lord no im glad you came and
i hope youll come back some evening and
stay longer

  and though catherine gave vent to an
exclamation of impatient unbelief he actu-
ally meant that then in quiet warning he
added

  better not lean too heavily on that rail
it may collapse

  catherine left the rail without a sound
looked down into the launch again and
stepped on board denying herself the prof-
fer of any assistance

  please ask andy to come down she
said in a low toneless voice

  certainly what shall i say to him
nothing ill tell my own lies
charteris excused himself politely then
walked up the path leaving her to her own
somber reflections

  her mouth and her throat were dry and
in a moment or two whether she would or
not angry tears sprang into her eyes she

jabbed at them with a handkerchief
clenched her hands and bit upon her already
aching lips with astonishing intensity for
a woman of her accustomed poise and
calm

  it was not often that catherine morrison
had occasion to feel cheap and in these few
minutes she did not bless the impulse that
had encouraged her to trifle so carelessly
with edged tools her anger however was
not directed against charteris repeatedly
and without stint shrinking from the shad-
ows of canoes that whispered and crooned
as they passed her by she called herself
a fool

  the night that had wrapped her in
a cloak on the way up was now pitted with
eyes that peered and laughed not because
she had come there and had been ridiculed
for her pains but because she was going
away again so unimportantly and so pain-
fully little desired

  therefore catherine writhed and con-
tinued to denounce herself as an impression-
able idiot who was so mentally unbalanced
as to become maudlinly sentimental over
a man who was little better than a tramp

  presently charteris appeared again chat-
ting most unconcernedly with andy gra-
ham who was obviously suspicious of the
hausa dagger charteris carried so openly
in his hand

  you forgot this charteris said to
catherine bending over to put the weapon
carefully into her grasp

  oh-thanks she acknowledged weakly
when she realized what it was i-im
sure elsie will be glad to add it to her col-
lection

  later when the silent andy graham had
steered the bonnys launch away from the
little wharf and was heading thankfully
down-stream catherine could almost have
enjoyed cutting her tongue out for that
final remark it sounded so small and weak
afterward

  charteris however did not stop to think
about it he hurried to the bush at the
back of the beach passing the galley
stairs he whispered to ogulo the dwarf to
go up and blow out the lamp then went on
to join abado who was fuming impatiently
at the entrance to the narrow bush path
that led to the village of dowadda

  whas matter the sobo complained in
a disgruntled voice i wait long time
what govment man do


adventure

  shut up charteris ordered in an impo-
lite whisper and then added in belittling
pidgin abado talk all same mosquito
mm - mm - mm - mm - mm - all
time soon agwala shut him hands-so-
charteris brought the palms of his hands
sharply together to illustrate-and abado
shut up plenty too quick sofly sofly
wan

  without any further talk he dived into
the bush path and thereafter brushed his
way through the eery bat- and moth-
haunted darkness with no more concern
than he would have shown in the strand
he had evidently traveled the path often
enough to be able to dispense with a lan-
tern

  abado followed in silence the sulky
quiet of a disciplined child he did not
understand the queer gray mans queerer
methods and did not pretend to and now
that his rage against agwala had roused him
completely from his suicidal lethargy he
was beginning to think for himself and to
hunger for action of his own devising

  as in the case of the murder of morrison
that action would be subtle only in the
soundlessness of its execution simply a
question of striking swiftly in the dark be-
fore his enemy had any opportunity to do
likewise to him

  and in truth abado was frankly out for
blood every nerve and sinew of him cried
out for the kind of vengeance that his hands
could feel and his eyes could gloat over

  there was nothing fine about his vision
his mercy would be the mercy of a wounded
bush cat and if it were possible that he
could see agwalas fat body die slowly inch
by inch or pound by pound he would con-
sider that all of life had been well worth the
trouble just for the reward of that single
evening

  the village of dowadda did not promise
anything to him its chief was a small oil-
trader named roku who from abados
viewpoint would sell himself to the highest
bidder

  why charteris put faith in men whose
canoes and wives were few abado could not
understand it would not have startled the
sobo if in the interval since the sun had
gone down the village of dowadda had
become a death trap bought and paid for
by agwala

  suddenly abado heard the light scuff of
cgulos feet behind him but save for a

half-turn of the head he ignored the dwarf
altogether keeping his eyes fixed upon
the middle of the gray mans back he
plodded on in an unenthusiastic jog-trot
that expressed his mental attitude more
eloquently than speech

  the night voices of the bush rustled and
whimpered and coughed and shrilled and
though it was not at all impossible that
among the unseen friendly shadows of
near-naked men who saw them go past
there might be others who would risk their
lives to serve agwala charteris did not
change his gait or hesitate even for a mo-
ment

  roku the chief of dowadda met them
just as they emerged from the path and
headed for the village evidently char-
teris visit had been prearranged

  roku was a stout but well-conditioned
jakri who had migrated from the warri
district some years before which was one
reason why abado did not trust him jakri
men from warri were in abados opinion
as smooth and treacherous as their women
were expensive

  govment come roku informed char-
teris in a mumbling voice mas malkett
he go way i tink so be all ri agwala
man come talk oil palaver five puncheon

i laugh inside my head

  then taking belated notice of abado he
said doh as a matter of course but other-
wise exhibited neither surprize nor fear nor
any emotion save a desire to serve the gray
man far beyond agwalas proffered bribe of
five puncheons of oil

  as he turned toward the village char-
teris laid the tips of his fingers retainingly
on his arm

  wait agwala live benin river all
time little time pass gray man go way
savez

  he kept his fingers on rokus arm but v
the jakri did not tremble he laughed and
his laughter was so spontaneous that even
ogulo who hung in the background
thought the sound mocked agwala too
loudly then roku said in jakri

  agwala is great he is the voice of
many but i am roku chief of dowadda

i am my own tongue and the gray man is my
friend

  abado sneered silently and charteris
paused a moment or two

  all right we go he said at last and
allowed roku to lead the way into the small
the gray charteris



mud-built village which being the home of
a jakri of warri was cleaner less evil
smelling and less of a hodge-podge enter-
prise than the majority of the villages in the
benin country

  just then it was in complete darkness
and save for the spasmodic wailing of a
wakeful infant or two it was also sound
asleep	

  roku was wholly unattended and the
stark and sprawling forms of those who
chose to sleep upon mats outside their huts
stirred but slightly as the little company
made its cautious way to the door of rokus
mud-and-thatch establishment

  it was of course a larger hut than any
of the others situated at the head of a semi-
circular lane that formed one half of a dou-
ble circle the compound being in the center

  they went no farther than the first room
of rokus house however and ogulo be-
cause of the curse that was upon him did
not go even as far as that he composed
himself in the dust outside the door while
roku seated his guests upon trading-beach
camp chairs around a roughly made table
constructed of unplaned deal boards roku
liked to give the impression that he lived
like a gentleman white man fashion

  in the dark and silent rooms that lay
beyond a screen of fiber mats the mysteries
of rokus household in spite of trading-
beach furnishings were as rampant as ever

  a white man might go through the rooms
from the hall of the gods to the burial
chamber and look those mysteries full in the
face and be entirely unaware of their mean-
ing and even of their presence

  some of them would remain unsolved
even at rokus death because if his gods
were good and no ill of the flesh or spirit
befell him he would die and be buried in
that house

 for such was the honor due to a chief such
as he had every intention of being-with the
gray mans beneficent assistance

  and to prove that he was worthy he
lighted a small kerosene lamp dropped the
mat screens over door and window and
from a hole in the mud wall that was con-
cealed behind another colorful mat he pro-
duced a bottle of perfectly good scotch and
another of english gin

  glasses followed and for the honor of
rokus house charteris drank two fingers
of scotch abado with a surly grunt took
gin roku himself took a little of both

  and immediately according to his own ver-
sion of it became a blood brother to the
sobo and the thumb-nail on the gray mans
right hand

  charteris smiled glanced from one to the
other of his companions and said simply-

  maybe so i want eight-paddle canoe

  roku nodded that was easy enough

  i think i go agwalla-town-now-one
time

  the whites of rokus eyes showed sharply
for a second then vanished

  cha

  the exclamation was abados and he
leaped to his feet glaring wildly about him
roku having composed his features again
merely nodded gravely and did not appar-
ently observe the big sobos excitement

  charteris gave no heed to either of them

  he was casually studying a nervous-
appearing bulge in the fiber mat screen
which separated the room from the others
this screen was divided into two equal
parts the one overlapping the other and
the bulge might have been caused by a slight
breeze it began however at a spot that
was about the height of a mans shoulder

  squat he ordered abado quietly and
the sobo sat down again as if his camp chair
were charged with electricity

  then before he had an opportunity to feel
half-way comfortable charteris declared-

  you go back to materri sofly sofly

  again abado stood upright expressing
more amazement than before

  materri was his own village and he knew
it would be the height of folly to go there

  roku smiled and shrugged his glistening
shoulders and the bulge in the fiber mat
screen shifted charteris leaned across the
table just a little and began trifling with the
bottle of scotch

  you fit to give him canoe he asked
roku as if abados protests were of no con-
sequence

  roku admitted that he could provide
abado also with a canoe

  all right two canoe one time we
talk doridi palaver tomorrow time

  roku nodded he knew doridi was the
confidant of agwala who had generously
told noni and abado so much about the
morrison-agwala interview at forcados
no one had seen or heard much about him
since that time

when the chief of dowadda departed to
do the gray mans bidding abados protests


adventure

broke out anew in a jabbering crescendo
he came and stood beside charteris chair
in an effort to impress him with the sin-
cerity and wisdom of his contentions

  if he went back to materri he argued it
would be equal to walking into the govern-
ment barracks at warri or sapeli the
village of materri was surely being watched
night and day both by the government and
by agwala and abado thought it would be
more simple to cut his own throat then and
there than to do anything so foolhardy as to
paddle his way into agwalas hands like that

  charteris did not attempt to suppress
him instead he allowed him to go on talk-
ing and rising from his chair argued
convincingly with him too all the while
twining his fingers about the neck of the
bottle of scotch

  the bulge in the mat screen leaped for-
ward suddenly

  abados back was toward it one mo-
ment he felt the grip of charteris powerful
left hand upon his arm the next he was
spinning across the room to the startling
accompaniment of the crash of breaking
glass a sudden darkness that swirled and
smothered and the sound of a revolver shot
that made his ear-drums ring

  then out of the dark there came the
unmistakable threshing of struggling bodies
a sharp squeal of pain that died in an un-
canny grunt and finally a low feeble moan
that chilled

  abado who was not unused to fights in
the dark crouched against the farthest wall
and shuddered

chapter xix

a partial explanation

ogul was many yards from the door
by that time rokus household was
awake rubbing its eyes the lifeless figures
who slept outside their huts were no longer
lifeless and roku himself down at the edge
of dowadda creek making ready the canoes
at the gray mans bidding turned his head
sharply at the sound of the shot and prompt-
ly became the color of dirty ashes

  muttering whispers that grew louder and
louder passed up and down the village from
end to end and back again the jabbering
of the women and the staccato grunting of
the men the frightened cries of many chil-
dren and the bleating and stampeding of

  equally frightened goats and sheep the
scurrying of excited naked feet and the
querulous inquiries of the very old-these
demonstrations rose and fell in waves and
died down again like the sucking rumble of
receding waters

  roku did not stir neither did he inquire
he was afraid he knew so afraid that he
cursed the white mans government and
still more fluently cursed agwala his
dream of greatness burst like a bubble in
a moment and if that were so there was
nothing to be gained by flight

  abado still cowered against the wall in
rokus hut once he heard a sound like
the rattle of a belt buckle but it meant
nothing to him when he finally did move
it was because he felt the approach of char-
teris rather than saw or heard him why
he knew it was the gray man he could not
have told because while there was a tu-
mult outside within that room there was
a silence that made breathing as difficult as
it seemed thunderous

  then charteris was at his elbow whisper-
ing in his ear

  abado was frightened there was no
doubt about that but that which char-
teris whispered made a slow evil grin ex-
pand from ear to ear he obeyed the touch
of the gray mans hand without so much as
an instants hesitation drew his overcloth
up over his head to conceal his face and
followed charteris out into the welcome
open still grinning

  a gasp of astonishment and fear went up
when they made their appearance it died
into a whispering awe as they proceeded to
the waterfront where roku waited there
was something unreal in the manner in
which every mouth was stopped and ev-
ery arm hung in listless inaction as they
passed by

  charteris ignored roku and gave all of
his attention to abado he saw to it that
the sobo entered the small canoe provided
for him and when abado again whimper-
ingly protested his return to materri char-
teris cursed him roundly in his own jargon
and told him impatiently to be off

  like a child venturing into the dark
alone abado paddled slowly and reluc-
tantly up stream so reluctantly at first
that charteris picked up a handy piece of
mangrove stick and hurled it after him with
such good aim that abado uttered a fright-
ened cry and paddled furiously out of range
the gray charteris



his grin however was broader and more
evil than ever

  then charteris turned to roku and said
simply

 come we go

  and he led the way back to rokus hut

  the jakri followed quaking he had not
failed to observe that there was a revolver
sticking in the gray mans belt-a revolver
that had not been there before

  and he knew to whom the weapon be-
longed

  fight under the circumstances was even
more useless than flight roku never even
thought of it his skin was still whole and
he passionately wished it to remain so as
long as possible

  bring lamp charteris ordered when
they reached the door of the hut again
tell all man go sleep no make talk
sofly sofly

  roku gulped quaveringly he issued an
order to his excited villagers to cease their
chattering and resume their disturbed slum-
bers then scurried nervously in search of
another lamp

  his dignity for the moment at least was
gone he might recover it again if the gray
man did not put an everlasting blight upon
him but until he was sure about this he
would feel like a paddle boy whose back
was raw after a flogging

  charteris entered the hut and went direct-
ly in the direction of the right hand corner
of the first room

  some one was wriggling like an eel in that
corner and giving vent to an occasional
moan of pain or fear when charteris told
the wriggler to save his energies quiet fell
instantly

  presently roku returned with a lamp
placed it on the table and then looked fur-
tively at the trussed figure of arthur
garriman bark roku seemed afraid to
assimilate too much of the truth all at
once

  and unquestionably arthur was a pa-
thetic spectacle his arms were strapped
behind him with his service belt and his
ankles were bound with the belt that ordi-
narily supported his trousers he was dirty
and disheveled and his head ached from the
effect of the quieting crack charteris had
given him with the butt of the revolver

  his morale therefore was at a very low
ebb charteris had the revolver abado
had escaped and malkett did not know he

   

was there many things could happen to
him long before malkett found it out

  sorry i missed you when you called at
grandisons the other evening charteris
said blandly would have saved all this
trouble if i hadnt was malkett foolish
enough to post you in there

  arthur did not answer he was afraid
to lie and more afraid to tell the truth and
he was not at all sure that roku was well
enough paid to go on lying indefinitely
so he kept his peace

  why were you so confoundedly anxious
to put a bullet into abado that you couldnt
wait until i was out of the way

  arthur did not answer that either but his
expression at once betrayed the fact that
charteriss surmise was unfailingly correct

  remember what i told you on the bonny
the other day

  arthur remembered and looked as if
he would like to forget

  and yet you took a cold-blooded pot
shot like that at him a thoughtful pause
i suppose that was why you visited
grandisons in my absence thought you
might spot him and do the trick without
having to take so desperate a chance as this
you used to be such a nice voung man too
what is it agwala or wonfen or both
bark writhed he hoped roku did not
understand much of what charteris was
saying

  as i see it charteris informed him
gratuitously you were going to take your
man as dead as you could make him and
turn him over to malkett as a good servant
of the crown should in other words-
come here

  the command was addressed to roku
who was edging toward the bottle of gin
all he wanted however was a drink to
steady his trembling legs but charteris
ordered him to stand against jthe opposite
wall and await his pleasure then he turned
to bark again

  in other words he went on as if no
interruption had occurred you were will-
ing to take that chance with me in the room

and if a careless shot had gone wild-

  no the negative was as hoarse as it
was desperate my chief gave me orders

to secure abado dead or alive-

  and agwala prefers him dead

 i know nothing of chief agwalas
desires

  you were so nervous about it too you


adventure

could not keep your shoulder out of the
picture

  arthur looked down his nose because
there was nowhere else to look with any
comfort and he was visibly relieved when
charteris switchedtiis attention to roku
whose knees sagged the moment the gray
man turned in his direction

  outside quiet had fallen again prob-
ably there were whispering speculations
being indulged in within the darkened walls
of every hut in dowadda but they were
only whisperings and did not reach rokus
ears even ogulo the dwarf had returned
and resumed his place jn the dust outside
the door

  charteris spoke in a low voice in rokus
own tongue

  speak truth small snake whose oil
paid for-this

  he touched bark contemptuously with
the toe of his boot

  roku looked all about him in a shivering
terror and his fear of the gray man was not
merely physical several times he began to
speak and each time the words died in his
throat

  finally being between the devil and the
deep sea-almost as fearful of agwalas
far-reaching vengeance as he was of the
powers of darkness attributed to the gray
man-he flung himself in the stereotyped
native fashion at charteris feet mumbling
the equally hackneyed admission that he
was a poor jakri man whose village was
small whose wives and goats and puncheons
were few and--

  charteris put his right foot down hard on
the groveling neck and his left dug sharply
into rokus ribs

get up	 

  a squeak of pain answered him and the
jakri threw himself bodily out of reach of
further punishment he huddled on the
floor about a yard away from bark and
quakingly awaited the gray mans next
move

  all right charteris said as if he were
perfectly satisfied we go agwala-town
wahl

  instantly roku began to whine in real
earnest while bark staring up at charteris
in petrified unbelief made queer sounds in
his throat as if he were choking for breath
neither of them seemed to be at all
anxious to visit agwala-town under these
conditions

  i wont go arthur sputtered at last
its preposterous i stfn a servant of his
majesty  i wear his uniform this sort
of thing may be all perfectly well for com-
mon natives but i am an officer of the con-
stabulary and though i am at present-
pro tem that is-at a physical disadvantage

it is simply pro tem and the sooner-

  charteris went quietly to the door of the
hut saw ogulo squatting there and called
him in

  ogulo backed away

  i no fit he whimpered knowing that
because he was accursed he would defile
rokus house if he entered it and thereby
unnecessarily incur the displeasure of the
chief

  apparently charteris understood ogulos
hesitation

  the house of roku is the house of a
very small lizard he said simply smaller
even than you come

  ogulo obeyed this time but gingerly
and when roku saw ogmo-of-the-long-
arms put his foot across the threshold he
immediately set up a wail that threatened
to rouse the house and the village again
he covered his head with his cloth and
rocked back and forth calling the shades
of his fathers to witness that the blight that
had fallen upon his house was not of his
devising

  charteris ordered him to be silent and
with a gesture to the amazed ogulo told 
the dwarf to release barks ankles then
sliding over to roku he seized him by the
scruff of the neck and yanked him most
ungently to his feet he held him there
voiceless and unmoving until bark stood
reluctantly upright his arms still strapped
behind him his trousers belt returned to its
proper sphere of influence

  all the while arthurhad been protesting
in more or less grandiloquent english
against the indignity he was suffering and
finally since charteris gave no heed to his
eloquence asked thickly and hopelessly-
you are going to take me to agwala-
town like this

  exactly why not

  arthur made several attempts before he
was able to say

  bu-bu-but you have the revolver
isnt that security enough

  charteris laughed tonelessly

  its the moral effect im driving at he
explained youre a yellow dog you know
the gray charteris

 

and i want to be sure you feel the part
barks chin had the decency to sink
lower and lower until it rested on the first
button of his tunic he had nothing more
to say

  whereupon charteris gave roku most
explicit instructions as to his conduct on
the way down to the creek side and indi-
cated with a prod of barks revolver muz-
zle what was likely to transpire first and
foremost if there was any trouble of his
making

  then telling ogulo to see to it that bark
behaved properly they filed out of the hut
and started off in the direction of the
waterfront

  there were eyes that saw them go past
vague whispering voices that questioned
their going but there was no demonstration
of hostility charteris said to roku in a
low voice as they neared the creek

  five puncheons you laugh inside your
head member charteris chuckled
while the jakri squirmed whats matter
agwala man no here

  rokus step lagged purposely

  agwala no savez this palaver he
mumbled agwala no pay be bark pay
i no savez bark go make shoot palaver

  i see barks own idea entirely eh
then dropping into pidgin again  mem-
ber them time you laugh when i say
agwala live  benin river all time

  roku remembered that too as his sheep-
ish expression indicated

  you laughed plenty too much char-
teris informed him for his future guidance
when jakri man on benin river laugh at
agwala all same roku laugh then-he lie
he lie in his belly and in his head savez
roku felt as if he were shrinking his
feet became like heavy weights to be
dragged along the ground

  agwala no pay he repeated thickly and
desperately be bark pay i no savez
he go make shoot palaver

  charteris did not dispute the point he
prodded roku into a faster gait presently
they arrived at the creek side where an
eight-paddle canoe with its complement of
paddle boys awaited them and he said to
ogulo the dwarf sharply

  go for my canoe bring it agwala-
town creek make plenty quick

  ogulo had no relish for the assignment
the farther he kept away from agwala-
town creek the better pleased he would be

but he hesitated only a moment or two then
with an acknowledging grunt trotted in his
ungainly way toward the bush path leading
to grandisons beach

  a few minutes later in spite of barks
eloquent indignation and rokus sniveling
appeals to be left behind charteris and his
guests were squatting under the grass
awning that sheltered the small matted
deck of the eight-paddle canoe

  as the sleepy paddle boys shoved off and
turned the canoes nose down stream char-
teris said to arthur garriman bark pleas-
antly

  i had a notion earlier in the evening
that i might be compelled to visit your fat
friend but i didnt anticipate quite so
much company

chapter xx

the popularity oe agwala

hogmanay sandy macgregor

had not stuck a revolver in his belt
since chief motu of segwanga had made his
justly famous last stand this had been
several years before

  consequently the circumstance that he
was oiling no less than two regulation army
revolvers-his beach clerks and his own-
when he heard catherine morrisons step
on the stairs late that evening was more
remarkable than catherine might have
thought had she been permitted to see the
weapons

  they were out of sight in a drawer of
macgregors desk when she entered his
office and hogmanay called to her from his
bedroom while he washed his hands

  sit right down catherine ill be with
you in a minute

  all right dont hurry

  macgregor had not expected catherine
so soon and she for her part was calling
upon him only because she had said she
would before she left the yacht she did
not anticipate that hogmanay would have
anything to say to her she did not already
know and took it for granted that he had
seen her come up the beach from the launch
and that he was probably struggling into
a collar and tie most of which his beard
would conceal in any case

  it was apparent-or would have been to
fran goddard for instance-thdl catherine
was torn loose from the solid foundations
ioo

adventure

she had been so careful to build under her

feet

  she did not sit down while she waited
hogmanays appearance pacing the floor
f his office she was still acutely conscious
of the pressure of charteris arm and she
knew it would be impossible to forget the
awful stifling feel of his hand across her
mouth

  the experience had been far from playful
while it lasted she had been entirely at
charteris mercy and as is common wih
adventures of the sort their real significance
becomes more apparent afterward

  catherine was just beginning to realize
what had happened to her and how simply
it had happened later when her perspec-
tive improved she would understand it
even better while she was trying to bring
some semblance of order out of the chaos
of her uprooted emotions hogmanay
came in

  yere worried about something he
asked at once quietly who brought ye
over

  andy catherine answered shaking
hands hes waiting in the launch i just
came over because- oh malkett doesnt
seem to be getting anywhere and i had
another cable from mother this morn-
ing

  aye so ye would shell be anxious
about ye will ye not sit down

  catherine accepted the chair macgregor
offered looked out toward the lights of the
bonny and the farther dim lights of the
hulk then asked-

  do you think abado really did it
hogmanay thought that over in truth
he was far from sure about it and having
given his conversation with charteris due
consideration the things he had learned in
the past few days had been sufficiently in-
teresting to induce him to borrow a revolver
to augment his own

  ive not decided yet he returned
cannily as the shuffling foot of a sleepy
steward scuffed its way through the dining-
room galleyward what makes ye think
he didnt

  i didnt say i thought that

  no but yere doubtin an apparently
established fact and that means yere no so
sure about it why

  oh dont quibble catherine rose so
quickly and her displeasure was so evident
that hogmanays eyebrows lifted sharply

im in no mood to bother with-fine defini-
tions what i want is action

  macgregor nodded placidly

  aye i dont doubt it a bit i feel that
way mysep sometimes when im waitin
for other folks to do a bit o work for me
tell me about it

  tell you about what catherine ex-
ploded

  about whats makin ye snap at me
like that

 oh-i-i-

  no dont say youre sorry didnt
he tell you whether abado did it or no
catherine laughed a little off key and
looked quickly out toward the river again
he-who-what do you mean

  ill admit andy graham makes a good
chaperon macgregor said dryly and
smiled

  then because catherine continued to
look steadily out into the blackness toward
the river wishing it would swallow her he
added in a low gentle voice

  there are a lot o things happenin out
there that you dont see like malkett
some o the rest o us seem to be just sittin
down and waitin for things to come off
but were not as much asleep as yed
think a moments pause garland-
hes my shop clerk-saw ye goin up to
grandisons beach the night about an
hour ago

 how-

  he was goin to the bonny in my gig
wi a message and saw ye cornin down the
companion ladder-or rather he wasnt
sure it was you then but the launch
headed straight up-river he told me and-
well youre here now so its all right
he didnt have to tattle to you about it
did he she asked impulsively

  who garland yere wrong there
garland doesnt know ye went up to gran-
disons beach that is he didnt say so to
me ye see the message i sent him with
was for you and ye werent there they
told him you had come here and that he
must have missed ye in the dark

  catherine breathed deeply she saw a
beach watch boy standing on the main
wharf gently swinging a hurricane lamp
the light danced irritatingly and she wished
the boy would hold it still

  how do you know i went to grandisons
beach

  oh-i just guessed it theres not
the gray charteris



much else up that way and-hes a fasci-
natin man

  catherines mouth still tender tightened
into a line

  yes quite but niggardly with infor-
mation her fine eyes suddenly met hog-
manays without a flicker he refused to
be in the least helpful

  wouldnt tell you whether abado was
up there or no

  not a thing what was the message
you sent me

  hunh hes a queer stick hogmanay
stroked his beard thoughtfully i was
thinkin that maybe if you and me paid
a certain fat man an informal visit we
might clear the atmosphere a bit

agwala now at this time of night
yere not afraid o the dark are ye
afraid good heavens no cant we
take the launch it would be ever so much
quicker

  hogmanay grinned

  youre hugh morrisons bairn he
conceded and in his opinion that was the
highest compliment he could pay her and
thats just what i want agwala to get into
his thick head theres a lot o his trade
thats playin tricks these days that are not
accordin to hoyle

  tricks

  just that his trade is wanderin about
-here there and everywhere-and were
not gettin the half of it even jardine over
there has done nearly as much business as
i have in the past two r three days

  catherine regarded hogmanays unusual
indignation with a slight smile

  you dont mind that very much do
you

  mind and why not then observ-
ing catherines scepticism more closely
oh ye mean margaret he shook his
head slowly thats neither here nor
there but since yeve brought up the sub-
ject can i ask you a favor

  surely

  will ye try to kidnap her or something
and take her wi ye when you go home
catherine laughed

  fran suggested that this morning she
said simply and i hope we can persuade
her to come

  thats fine

  hogmanay paused a moment or two then
got back to business with an abruptness
that jarred apparently he was in no mood

to let sentiment interfere with his responsi-
bility to the firm

  agwala is not livin up to the promises
he made your father at forcados he rum-
bled when i sent for him to come up
here tonight he put me off wi an excuse
so im goin to him

  and where do i come in catherine
asked expectantly

  well ye see youre a morrison mac-
gregor ansveered with solemn conviction
and agwala knows the difference between
a member o the family and a servant im
just a servant you will be something he
never expected to happen and ill warrant
if we land in on him at this hour hell be
a whole lot more afraid o you than you will
be of him are ye sure ye want to go now
of course i wouldnt miss it for worlds
and im just crazy to do something to
help

  aye i thought ye would be itll be
a sort o business meetin with you as chair-
man o the board ill do the talkin and
youll nod like a judge and make him as un-
happy as ye can by sayin as little as possi-
ble the charteris man didnt happen to
mention trade did he

  catherines smile faded with a sharpness
that was startling

  nothing i told him what agwala said
about the shielding of abado and he
laughed at me

  um-well ye shouldnt have told him
that macgregor said cannily as the
back beach watch boy solemnly struck six
bells on the old ships bell that hung
inside the oil yard fence but its no
matter he probably knew it already
that watch boys a bit slow its nearer
twelve than eleven just a minute till i
call garland

  is he coming too

  aye im thinkin hed better hes
a handy man to have about ye in a native
village

  gracious that sounds exciting

  no--just a bit o caution in the matter of
where to put yodr feet hogmanay said
halting a moment in the doorway native
villages are not overparticular under foot
and ye wouldnt be fit to live with if you
were laid up with a sprained ankle now
catherine laughed she was tingling all
over in the hope that the visit to agwala-
town was not going to be as mild as hog-
manav promised macgregor went along


adventure

to garlands room praying that he was not
making a mistake in taking her there

  garland was waiting for him

  all right the shop clerk announced
im full of artillery can you see any
of it

  hogmanay looked him over critically

  just a suspicious looking lump under
your left arm pull it forard a bit and itll
be all right

  garlands hand disappeared under his
shirt and pulled the lump forward a little

  fine hogmanay approved but
im hopin we dont have to murder any-
body come along and take miss morrison
down to the launch while i get ready

  in another minute hogmanay was ex-
plaining to catherine that he had one or
two little things to attend to and that if she
would go to the launch and advise andy
graham where they were going he would
join her in a jiffy

  catherine accepted garlands escort with
a smile that put him immediately at his
ease the moment they were gone hog-
manay promptly retrieved the revolvers
from his desk

  he loaded them carefully and like gar-
land slung one under each armpit inside his
shirt it was a trick he had learned from
a poetic gentleman known from sierra
leone to duke town calabar by the vio-
lent pseudonym of knife-edge harring-
ton the gentleman by the way who was
responsible for the aforementioned last
stand of chief motu of segwanga

  hogmanay recalled the affair and the
man with a reminiscent grin then making
sure that there was nothing but the measure
of his own speed to hinder the draw he
solemnly gave instructions to a sleepy
steward not to blow out the lamp and went
slowly and meditatively down stairs

  there was not the smallest danger to
catherine in the little midnight adventure
agwala-town under macgregors guidance
would be safer than west kensington not
because hogmanays mighty right arm was
a source of terror simply that he was a
trader

  a uniform has frequently been a mans
death warrant in the delta while a gray
flannel shirt and a pair of oil-smeared white
drills have gone blandly through many a
seething caldron of rebellion

  and macgregor believed that this was
still the case in spite of the murder of hugh

morrison morrison had died because
blinded by the strong sunlight on the
heights he had thought himself immune
from the penalty of taking sides in a black
mans quarrel

  so that hogmanay with two revolvers
under his shirt was not worrying to any
extent about what would happen to cath-
erine he was troubled however because
of the demonstration he would probably
have to make to induce agwala to keep his
promises

  and he knew that the ponderous chief of
agwala-town was desperately afraid of
guns

      elsie and fran goddard lay in
mosquito-curtained camp beds on
j the bonnys after deck partially
surrounded by canvas screens and entirely
free from the annoyance of mosquitoes and
sandflies it was much more pleasant to
lie there than to sit on deck under the light
and be eaten alive and simply because one
went to bed it was not necessary to sleep

  where in the world could she have
gone elsie asked for the fiftieth time as
the bonnys bosun struck seven bells its
hours and hours since garland was here
oh shes probably listening to mac
playing the fiddle tommy dillingworth
said assuringly from the other side of the
canvas screen where he sat in a deck chair
and smoked incessantly i see his light
is still burning

  fiddle fiddlesticks fran interjected
go home now tommy and let us get to
sleep	-

  sleep elsie was horrified do you
think i could sleep before i was sure cath
was all right

  tum-te-tum-te-tum fran ridiculed
run along tommy you have no busi-
ness to be hanging around a ladys dormi-
tory any way and this one hasnt any
door or a roof go away

  elsie snickered but tommy lingered a
minute or two hoping she would ask him to
stay because she needed the assurance of
his presence but elsie was silent she
had begun to count the beat of her pulse
wondering when she was going to have
malaria

  so tommy murmuring a reluctant good
night strolled forward altogether disgusted
with life in general and fran goddard in
particular
the gray charteris



 he hung over the rail near the companion-
ladder till captain walton joined him
then because there was nothing else to dv
he accepted the captains invitation to pro-
ceed to the smoking-room where they played
cribbage and drank long drinks

  presently the bosun intruded with a pen-
cil-scribbled note which he said had been
delivered by a kroo-boy from marsdens
beach it was directed to captain walton
and read

captain walton-

  i am going down-river with mr macgregor and
andy dont let the girls wait up for me

catherine

  tommy read it too and at once departed
for the after deck and the ladies dormitory
waltons just had a note from cather-
ine he announced it says-

  sh fran goddard cautioned sharply
elsies asleep

  therefore tommy whispered the rest of
it and walked heavily away

  fran listened to his lagging step for a
little while as if it annoyed her then re-
sumed the business of biting nervously upon
her underlip

  her eyes were curiously wide-dilated-
great black pools that were sullenly dis-
turbed all at once they stormed she
turned suddenly upon her face and beat the
pillow savagely with her clenched hands

  -- you i want to sleep

  the whispering voice of the bush echoed
it mockingly

chapter xxi

guns

catherine had but a misty realiza-
tion of the journey between marsden
 cos beach and agwala-town

  when the launch had turned from the
main stream into agwala-town creek
there came a blacker dark that made the
walls of mangrove still more forbidding

  canoes slipped past like ghosts giving
forth no sound save the swish of the pad-
dles which was not unlike the rustle of a
shroud others that dawdled close in to
the bush whispered a little more excitedly
than usual as the launch passed by but it
was all vague and indefinite to catherine
who had a desire to turn a searchlight upon
it to discover what it was all about

  wont agwala be annoyed at us for
waking him up she asked garland while
hogmanay was occupied showing andy
where to go

  hell be annoyed whether we have to
wake him up or not garland declared with
a grin but id be willing to wager he
hasnt gone to bed yet hes a grand old
night owl is agwala his own people say
he never sleeps

  from what i saw of him i should have
said he was asleep most of the time are
we nearly there

  in a few minutes just around the next
bend

  he doesnt expect us does he

  no but we wont surprize him very
much he has too many watch boys
catherine was visibly disappointed the
little adventure had a dark midnight
flavor it was true but it lacked the spice of
uncertainty keeping the mosquitoes away
seemed to form the most active part of it

  the next bend was accomplished without
difficulty and in another minute the launch
had scraped alongside agwalas little wharf
and hogmanay was saying to the shadow-
like figure of the watch boy thereon

  tell agwala i bring missy capn
morrison make quick

  the watch boy startled by the announce-
ment shot up the path to the town with
hardly a seconds delay and he had barely
disappeared when another also carrying
a bobbing hurricane lantern came forward
suddenly from a by-path to the right and
took his place

  evidently the second watch boy when
he saw hogmanay garland and catherine
climb on to the wharf did not consider him-
self and his solitary lantern sufficient for so
large a visitation of white people

  so he made a thick unintelligible noise
in his throat and two more watch boys ap-
peared out of the bush with a suddenness
that made catherine jump she realized
that garland had spoken the truth when he
had stated that agwala had too many watch
boys

  garland took a firm grip upon her arm
with his left hand his right under caver
of a broad flowing four-in-hand tie rested
idly on his chest

  macgregors beard made a better screen
than garlands tie and as he grunted an
order to the watch boys to go ahead his
expression indicated that agwala was going


adventure

to keep the promises he had made at for-
cados or else have reason to regret he had
ever made them

  andy remained in the launch and smoked
the mosquitoes from about his ears with-
out expressing any opinion on the matter he
condemned the whole business utterly

  passing along a broad well-worn bush-
path and around a single turn then past
a straggling group of mud-and-wattle huts
that became less scattered and developed
into a large and fairly compact circle
catherine was aware of only a blurred con-
fusion of shadows and unclean smells and
of indeterminate things that lay around like
animals asleep

  then something huge rose up out of the
dark something with a light in it and she
stood before the house agwala had built

  it was a white mans house and chief
agwala was secretly annoyed by the cir-
cumstance that he was not the first native
chief who had built one but it was bigger
than that of any competitor and when
catherine saw it she wondered if she were
not actually standing before one of marsden
 cos house-and-shop constructions

  as a matter of fact she was agwala had
built his house after the pattern of mars-
dens at warri even the lower of the two
floors in imitation of the customary shop
was used as a store-room and like the
general warehouse of the trading-factory
contained all things necessary to man

  agwala lived on top in one corner of
the house there were lamps burning and
as catherine climbed the stairs she realized
that she had been climbing just such stairs
on factory after factory all the way up from
old calabar

  from the top of the stairs however she
could see that agwala-town itself was much
as it had ever been it spread out all
around agwalas house fawning in slavish
squalor at the feet of opulence sordid
dank and sinister and but vaguely in-
definite of population and purpose it was
still but a meager shelter of a groveling
people huddling together in the heart of a
sun-scorched mangrove swamp

  so that agwalas house was all the more
incongruous it had no place in catherines
picture particularly at that time of night

  his reception room-the equivalent to
a trading-agents office-was furnished in
wicker from madeira and lavishly strewn
with native mats more colorful than jo-

sephs coat here and there were enlight-
ening evidences of upper niger handcraft
and needlework

  but the extravagant number of lusty
colored cushions that occupied the wicker
divan and the chairs and overflowed as it
were on to the floor suggested at once to
the initiated that agwala had become pos-
sessed by a fad and had indulged in it to
his hearts content

  he met macgregor in the doorway lead-
ing on to the veranda and even in his suave
and oily moments-and this was one of
them-he was simply a little less neutral
than usual

  doh he greeted macgregor jakri
fashion i glad missy capn morrison
come look me he made a heavily
stilted courtesy to catherine you sit
down i hab boy bring drink one time

  hogmanay waved the offer of drinks aside
in a manner that sent agwala back to his
cushioned divan with an inquiring look in
his eyes

  no drink hogmanay said shortly
and evidently intended to waste no time
with the finer points of diplomacy missy
capn morrison came talk trade palaver
savez

  agwala nodded apparently he thought
the prospect both new and interesting he
made no audible comment however simply
settled himself among his cushions and
waited for the discussion to begin

 you member you talk with missy
capn morrisons father at forcados
macgregor asked as garland casually took
up a position behind catherines chair

  i member i sorry he done die sorry
too much

  you member you talk trade palaver
macgregor continued

  i member

  then whats matter you no do them
thing you promise to missy capn morrison
father

  agwala thought that over he looked at
hogmanay with his head a little on one side
and then slowly shifted his glance to cath-
erine

  i no savez he said simply-which is
the delta natives invariable answer to
anything he does not care to understand

  thick guttural whisperings from the vil-
lage lifted themselves into the short silence
that followed a restless sound like that of 
some large animal moving uneasily and
the gray charteris



grunting in its sleep hogmanay permit-
ted thte silence to hold for fully a minute
while he looked the bulky chief over from
head to foot

  huh it was not often that mac-
gregor sneered his contempt for agwala
seemed to radiate from him in sparks
you no savez eh youre a small-boy
eh no get sense in your head he
reached his feet suddenly you he
savez you lie like bushman you trade
in siluko in koratown and at jardine
hulk and in lagos you think i be
fool

   agwalas eyes flattened just a little then
he shrugged his shoulders so that they al-
most touched his ears

  you say i lie be all righ you be big
man pass me

  and his glance traveled to catherine and
garland as if to inquire whether they did
not agree with him that macgregor was
a bigger and more powerful man than he

  hogmanay sat down again and tried
another tack

  you trade in siluko

  lil bit agwala admitted with oily
simplicity

  koratown

  lil bit my boys go dere i no savez
you lie you savez all right you sent
them there but them time you talk with
missy capn morrisons father at forcados
you talked different mouth no be so
another expressive shrug of the shoulders
was the most of agwalas answer to which
he added that if macgregor was so con-
vinced that he was a liar there was not
much to be gained by him saying anything
at all about it

  hogmanays right hand slipped under his
beard and garlands sought the cover of his
four-in-hand tie

  catherine simply sat and watched ag-
walas fat shiny and imperturbable coun-
tenance with the fascination of one who was
afraid to speak in case it might spoil the
performance even the bat that whirled
eerily past the door in its circling flight over
the stertorously slumbering village did not
distract her attention

  when white man make promise hog-
manay said slowly white man do what he
say when he no do what he say big pala-
ver live savez

  agwala understood that and admitted it
so hogmanay asked-

 you make promise to missy capn
morrisons father at forcados

  i make lil bit promise missy capn
morrisons father make promise to me
but he done die he no fit nowto do um
promise palaver set

  hogmanay did not agree with agwalas
sophism his hand came slowly from be-
neath his beard and descended without
any fuss or demonstration of hostility to his
knee garlands hand also appeared from
under his tie and came to rest leisurely on
the back of catherines chair

 char

  it was then just as she felt garlands
free hand grasp her shoulder warningly that
catherine saw agwalas expression change
as if the craven fear that lurked behind its
smug and self-satisfied shelter of fat were
suddenly uncertain of its security a massive
sort of restlessness shook him from head to
foot he sat bolt upright and the whites of
his eyes showed for the first time

  catherine stole a sidelong glance at mac-
gregor and discovered a large blue-barreled
revolver resting quietly-but only too sig-
nificantly-on his knee and following
agwalas fear-filled look behind her she
caught the glint of another revolver barrel
that rested almost indifferently on the back
of her chair

  garlands grip on her shoulder tightened
a little and she exhaled a deep breath sound-
lessly then smiled this she admitted
with another glimpse at agwalas graying
countenance was most interesting

  the shrill whistling of the crickets in the
bush seemed to grow louder and louder and
the low drone of voices somewhere not far
distant made the possibilities of the situa-
tion assume an explosive quality that was
exciting

  now we go talk macgregor said
quietly and we go talk true talk
savez

  e-yaw chal

  all right keep your seat this gun
he nice quiet gun when man talk true
but when man talk lie-

  hogmanay left the rest of it to agwalas
imagination the chief knew at once that
whatever protection he might be able to
afford himself later he was just then in
a hopeless position

  i--i no savez whats the matter he
whined and looking toward catherine
tried to be friendly and indignant at the
io

adventure

same time i no do nothing i be your
friend all same i be your father friend
long time i savez your father he be
proper man them time me and him talk
we talk sofly sofly all same proper man
talk gun palaver no good i fear all
man fear gun palaver trade go way them
time gun palaver come i talk true missy
capn for sure i talk true agwala no fit
to lie

  catherine listened attentively enough
then appreciating what was expected of
her and being conscious of an acute desire
to take a hand in the game she turned to
macgregor with an assumption of imperi-
ousness that disturbed agwala in no small
measure

  tell him he must keep the promises he
made to my father and that if he doesnt
well find a way to make him were not
compelled to tolerate any shuffling on his
part are we

  hogmanay nodded respectfully and gar-
land had considerable difficulty in conceal-
ing a grin then hogmanay interpreted
catherines dictum and added a few re-
marks on his own account

  the effect upon agwala was most marked
he looked from hogmanay to catherine in
a bewildered fashion and it was evident
that he did not know what to make of missy
capn morrison there was a quality in the
steadiness of her gray eyes that bothered
him considerably and of course there
were the guns that made his fat quiver and
upset his powers of thought completely

  suddenly catherine had an idea of her
own perhaps it was a dangerous idea but
the moment  it came to her she was
compelled to give voice  to it she
spoke so sharply that even hogmanay was
startled

  tell him on second thought i may
change my mind about the promises that
were made at forcados if he has forgotten
his responsibilities in the matter we can
forget ours too tell him also that if he
is looking for a fight with guns or without
them marsden  co will give him one
that will make him the sorriest jakri in
benin river

  garland wanted to cheer but hogmanay
canny as usual and having some difficulty
in concealing his surprize at catherines
sudden vehemence hesitated

  go on tell him who the dickens is
he that we should have to come here at this

time of night to argue fine distinctions
with him

  agwala saw the fire in catherines eyes
quite plainly and as hogmanay had
said he knew the difference between a mem-
ber of the family and a servant macgreg-
ors attitude increased the difference and
garland standing behind catherines chair in
so protecting a position heightened the effect

  what-whats matter agwala asked
catherine respectfully you no savez i
be your friend

  catherine dismissed the plea with a ges-
ture that left no doubt in agwalas mind at
least of her position in the matter she
turned quickly to hogmanay and said
just a little impatiently

  oh go on tell him what i said you
could also tell him just for effect that
abado isnt dead yet im sure he wouldnt
like to be reminded of that

  macgregors eyes brightened for a sec-
ond he nodded slowly and thoughtfully
and finally began where catherine left off

  he asked agwala to remember that
abado was still very much alive also until
the sobo was proved guilty of morrisons
murder he was innocent in the sight of the
white mans law and his trade in its sub-
stance at least was just as purchasable as
that of any other trader

  therefore since agwala had not kept his
promises marsden  co did not feel under
any obligation to keep theirs they could
not trust agwala again and did not care to
make a new agreement if they wished to
trade with abados boys they would do so

  such macgregor concluded for the sake
of emphasis was the decision of missy
capn morrison

  agwala gasped his fat hands orna-
mented with diamonds that splashed rather
than sparkled pawed the air then in an
effort to make himself understood cather-
ine was plainly as hogmanay had pre-
dicted an element he had not considered for

a moment and the guns-

  but-but abado he kill your father
he stammered at last while a cold trickle
coursed slowly down his spine you go

trade-

  we go trade with all man hogmanay
answered and rose to indicate that the dis-
cussion was ended and catherine immedi-
ately followed suit if abados boys bring
oil if all man bring oil and kernels-all be
same palaver set
the gray charteris



  agwala sank among his cushions as un-
moving as he had been but a minute before
a mass of excited gesticulation even the
guns seemed to be forgotten

 he was not looking at hogmanay or
garland his attention was entirely de-
voted to catherine who he was sure was
altogether responsible for the complete re-
versal of the terms of his agreement with
her father

  catherine returned his rather blank stare
with an ill-concealed contempt for some
reason or other as she expressed it to her-
self she hated the beast

  palaver set agwala questioned as
though he wanted to be sure that her de-
cision was final

  palaver set catherine repeated calmly
and turned toward hogmanay and the door

  the scuff of a naked foot sounded on the
veranda it was followed by that of some
one who wore boots

  agwala turned his head sharply so did
hogmanay and garland who slipped their
revolvers out of sight in a trice

  first into the lamp light came roku
chief of dowadda after him with his
arms dramatically strapped behind him
came arthur garriman bark

  then charteris with barks revolver
sticking in his belt

chapter xxii

and this

agwala seems to be popular this eve-

-	ning

  charteris regarded the little tableau as
though it earned his unqualified approval
apparently it did not surprize him in the
least whether he had managed to escape
the vigilance of agwalas numerous watch
boys altogether or had simply by virtue
of his personality and the queer company he
kept walked roughshod over them was
a little problem no one thought much about
just then

  for many heavy seconds there was a flat
and breathless silence everybody looked
at roku and bark-particularly bark-
and then rather blankly at charteris again

  agwalas face sagged and he sank deeper
among his cushions his dull little eyes
narrowed and he waited more in fear than
in caution for some one else to speak first

catherine drew a little nearer to hog-

manay and garland kept his position at her
elbow when he touched her arm to assure
her of his protecting presence he discovered
that she was trembling and she drew away
from him as though she did not want to be
found out

  i dont seem to be very welcome
charteris said breaking the pause

  oh yere welcome enough hogmanay
declared studying the unique-situation as
cannily as possible but what have ye
got him tied up like that for

  its an outrage arthur broke out
vehemently lilting his head with dramatic
emphasis as if the sound of macgregors
voice had suddenly awakened him from a
brow-beaten lethargy he has brought me
here by force of arms and i appeal to you
mr macgregor to assist me i am an offi-
cer of the crown i wear the kings uni-
form and-

  aye thats so but its no the uniform
im botherin about and then to charteris
in a friendly tone that was not without sus-
picion whats he been doin and how
did ye manage to dodge agwalas watch
boys

  we didnt my friend arthur has a lot
of influence among watch boys and i per-
suaded him to use some of it

  its untrue a gross prevarication
when he ordered them to remain at the
wharf and told them that it was not neces-
sary to accompany us or announce our ar-
rival they stood around like sheep like
sheep

  hogmanay glanced puzzlingly at char-
teris then at roku and finally at bark
again the shadow of a slow grin was his
answer to arthurs indignation

  ye mean they let him bring you up
here and didnt help you a bit-as ye ex-
pected they might yere no a bonny sight
arthur what were ye doin to get yourself
into a mess like this

  thats what ive brought him here to
find out charteris broke in easily just a
moment id like to ask agwala about it
he went toward agwala suddenly and
with obvious purpose and stood over him
looking quietly but fixedly down into his
face startled at first the chief burrowed
nervously away and when for his dignitys
sake he did try to get a grip upon himself
and was on the point of uttering a blustering
protest charteris calmly struck him hard
across the mouth with the back of his hand
io

adventure

  here man here what are ye doin
hogmanay bellowed and started forward
while agwala cursed volubly in jakri
every one else gasped in astonishment

  charteris paid no more attention to mac-
gregor than he did to catherine or garland
who hung bewildered in the background

  you look him he asked agwala and
indicated arthur garriman bark

  cha you flog me agwala screamed
you make me small-boy fool

  come here bark

  th-th-this is preposterous i will
appeal-

  come here

  as bark visibly trembling at the knees
went haltingly forward hogmanay drew
back a step and watched there was more
in this than the naked eye could see and
macgregor was not the man to act too
hastily at any time

  catherine wide-eyed and queerly cold
fumbled blindly for garlands arm she
could not see charteris face but agwalas
wrath was shrinking rapidly into a mumble
and barks expression was a study in sub-
mission she did not like to look upon al-
though he was ready enough to speak in his
own defense there was no rebellion in him
when charteris chose to insist upon it

  roku

  the chief of dowadda lurched to barks
side almost without demur in the presence
of agwala and so many white people of
importance he was more abject than a
paddle boy

  when charteris spoke again it was in
jakri

  agwala is the son and the father of
dogs he informed bark and roku com-
placently and you lick his feet he is
like a great fly that feeds on offal and you
lift up your hands to kill when you hear
the buzz of his wings his power is less than
the hours that were yesterdayv and when
abado the elephant stamps upon your bel-
lies and on his the laughter of the gray man
will be heard among the people of the ekoi
whose country is in the shadow of the
kameroons

  agwala started back just as if charteris
had struck him again and in truth
charteris could not have used a hippo hide
on the fat chiefs shoulders with more sting-
ing effect

  bark was so confused that he began to
mutter to himself in his mother tongue and

to look everywhere but into the face of
agwalas awful wrath roku pitifully in-
significant in his present surroundings
jabbered excitedly without uttering a sound

  what was that ye said macgregor
asked chatteris sharply while catherine
and garland looked blankly from face to
face in search of an explanation then
since charteris continued to give all of his
attention to agwala maybe id better
get miss morrison out o this before ye say
any more

  you should never have brought her into
this reeking pest-hole in the first place
charteris informed him blandly without
turning his head

  dropping into jakri again he continued

  agwala the father and the son of dogs
has barked at abado in the presence of the
gray man this- and he indicated roku
and arthur-is the gray mans answer
and thisi

  before hogmanay had any sort of oppor-
tunity to intervene before agwala who
squealed a jakri oath and flung his fat
beringed hands up before his face guessed
his insulters purpose charteris leaned
quickly forward and his snake like right
hand darted under agwalas guard

  with a twisting wrench he tore the heavy
coral necklace and the sacred and all-
powerful amulet from about the fat chiefs
neck and tossed them out on to the veranda

  the shriek agwala gave then was more
the cry of a wounded beast than that of a
man an ear-splitting yell that broadened
into a roar and then died out slowly and
terribly in a whine that dimmed into a
breath-taking quiet

  below the squalid village seemed to
shudder and shrink from that sound as from
a knell of doom the blackness beyond the
lamps rocked and swayed and when the
ever listening ears of the bush heard it
the ever whispering tongues were stifled

  even catherine realized the appalling
sacrilege charteris had committed noth-
ing could have degraded agwala more or
cast a more ugly smear upon his ancestry

  stop macgregors voice was like
a miniature thunderclap up wi your
hands

  apparently on the point of turning to
face hogmanay and the others as the
hurried patter and scuff of many naked feet
came to every ear charteris stopped short
he could see one of hogmanays revolvers
the gray charteris



the other was on a direct line with the
middle of his back his hands in simple
obedience went slowly above his head

  garland take that weapon oot o his
belt

  hogmanays scotch was broadening in
the excitement and garland who knew the
big trader better than he knew himself left
catherines side instantly

  faces that were all eyes and mouth ap-
peared in the veranda doorway to remain
there whispering in awe bark filled with
a speechless indignation backed as far out
of the limelight as he could and roku
sheep-like followed him

  agwala was leaning forward among his
cushions wiping a speck of blood from his
lips his eyes were glazed with passion and
when without even turning his head he
gave voice to a string of harsh jakri guttur-
als the faces in the veranda doorway melted
away in a soundless obedience that was
scarcely human

 mind how ye step hogmanay cau-
tioned garland gruffly and gave no hint of
the fact that he understood the gist of what
agwala had said hes a slippery cus-
tomer

  but sandy catherine involuntarily
protested almost as much astonished by the
suddenness of hogmanays action as by
charteris demoralizing performance of
a minute before surely you dont mean

  keep out o this catherine macgreg-
or warned heavily no garland not that
side go round the other way aye thats
better fine

  charteris face as garland plucked the
revolver from his belt indicated nothing
more than an indifferent submission to the
dictates of hogmanays thoroughly well-
supported authority

  all done he asked and began to lower
his hands

  no keep them where they are theyre
too busy anywhere else what have ye got
to say for yourself carryin on like that
are ye daft

  charteris laughed

  you sound like an elder of the kirk
macgregor and i hadnt half finished with
agwala when you interrupted me

  no do you know that hes just or-
dered his watch boys to be flogged on your
account

  certainly he is a nasty beast always

takes it out on the under dog and always
makes them do his dirty work our friend
arthur for instance

  it-its a lie

  sh hogmanay cautioned not so
loud then to charteris whats he
been up to maybe yell answer that now
attempted murder charteris declared
so frankly that catherine gave vent to an
involuntary ejaculation he tried to pot
me tonight with that gun garland just
took away from me

  its a lie i was-

  he tried to murder ye ye say hog-
manay said ignoring bark altogether

  he was trying to murder abado and in-
cluded me in the preformance charteris
admitted with still more astonishing frank-
ness and i simply wanted agwala to
know that he had missed and that it isnt
proper for him to induce his hirelings to take
pot shots at me i was telling agwala this
when you interrupted me

  even catherine smiled garland laughed
outright the brazen impertinence of the
man was something that mere words could
not encompass

  i see hogmanay said dryly youre
so honest youre most likely makin it up
what were ye and abado doin -when it
happened

  having a drink

  hunh and then principally for the
benefit of catherine and garland just
as if malkett wasnt sweatin himself to a
shadow looking for abado

  if malkett will persist in chasing the

wrong man-

  how do ye know abados the wrong
man

  perhaps its because bark is so anxious
to kill him before he catches him perhaps
its because agwala is such a fat and inde-
cent liar- oh half a dozen reasons
and perhaps its because ye know the
right man

  perhaps may i lower my hands now
im getting rather sick of this

  just a minute hogmanay said heavily
i think ill take bark with me and you
too just to make sure o things in official
circles parker im sure would like to
see ye

not tonight i am much too busy
again catherine smiled this though
she knew as well as any one in the room that
agwala squatting like a great black toad
no

adventure

upon silk was measuring the manner of his
revenge upon charteris as surely and as
callously as he would measure out a cup of
salt

   aye yere busy enough i dont doubt
 hogmanay agreed but i think your
 business can wait a while

  not tonight macgregor the sudden
edge on charteriss voice was most marked
i have stood here with my arms in the air
answering your questions and satisfying
your curiosity in the presence of a lady
simply to save a lot of shooting and the
possibility of you killing somebody

  eh

   hogmanay gaped ludicrously while cath-
erine and garland looked as if they were not
sure they had heard aright

  and i wont be disagreeable unless-
look out

   charteris voice lifting suddenly in a
shrill shout of warning was startling
enough then as far as catherine could
see he disappeared his uplifted arms and
silver gray head went out of sight beyond
hogmanays bulk as if he had been standing
on a trap door

   something less than a second later mac-
 gregor found two steel wire arms wrapped
 about his legs below the knees and he top-
 pled backward with unpleasant suddenness

	and force into a small wicker table his
arms were thrashing the air like flails in an
instinctive effort to preserve his balance as
the table and he crashed down together

   one of the revolvers spun along the floor
 to catherines feet the other in hog-
 manays right hand had the wicker table on
 top of it

   a lightning fast streak of silver gray
leaped for the veranda doorway and
flashed through it just as garland fired

   the shop clerk was faster and cooler than
 the majority of men would have been under
 the circumstances but the bullet whistled
 wide of its mark and buried itself viciously
 in one of the veranda uprights

   good night again miss morrison

   the voice floated back to catherine like
 a derisive echo of the shot and while
 agwala shrieked wildly in jakri while mac-
 gregor struggled in massive fury to his feet
 while garland sprang forward in useless pur-
 suit and bark and roku muttered nervous-
 ly to themselves catherine drew a long
 deep breath and slowly stooped to retrieve
 hogmanays fallen revolver

  she took her time about it not because
one revolver more or less would have made
any difference then but she was afraid
hogmanay would have been even angrier
than he was if he caught her smiling

some time later when all of his
unwelcome visitors had gone ag-
wala squatted among his beloved
silken cushions holding a broken coral
necklace and a cloth-wrapped amulet in his
plump hands

  he was quite alone the village below
was almost still again a quaking quiet that
had an uneasy dread of the dawn

  agwalas unctuous bulk was shaking
with alternate rage and fear and it would
have been difficult to determine which
emotion controlled him most

  his hatred was of the sort that strips the
flesh from an enemys bones strip by strip
while the victims eyes-

  but to his old and ever growing fear of
abado was added a still deeper terror of a
force he did not understand

  abado was just a man trade was largely
a matter of price but the gray man who
never hurried the old old man with the
face of a boy-there was no explaining the
why or the wherefore of him

  agwala had witnessed the amazing sub-
jection of bark he had seen the still more
astounding downfall of macgregor and he
had no difficulty in remembering how char-
teris had struck him-him agwala-just
as if he were nothing more than the least of
his inofficial slaves

  also he remembered distinctly what
charteris had said about the son and the
father of dogs

  he could neither read nor write the
jakri tongue knew nothing of letters or hiero-
glyphics but the writing on the wall can
always be read by the man who sees it there

  agwala nursed his broken coral necklace
and the sacred and all powerful cloth-
wrapped amulet in his trembling hands and
spelled out the letters one by one

chapter xxiii

the lament

t-t ogmanay was not in a conversa-
a - tional mood on the way back to the
yacht and marsdens beach aside from
the circumstance that his feelings as well as
the gray charteris

hi

his body had been severely jolted by char-
teris unethical conduct the manner in
which agwala had been ruthlessly man-
handled in his own house gave mac-
gregor so much to reflect upon that there
was little room in his thoughts for anything
else

  it suggested to him above all things
that he had probably made a grievous mis-
take in taking catherine to agwala-town
and also because charteris amazing
treatment of agwala encouraged him to add
two and two together and arrive at a fairly
conclusive four the events of the evening
left no doubt in his mind about abado being
guiltless of any complicity in the murder of
hugh morrison

  naturally conclusions of this sort occa-
sioned a considerable mental upheaval and
as he moodily released bark from his bon-
dage he said shortly

  ye can tell malkett or the provincial
commissioner whatever ye have a mind to
ill have a talk wi them in the morning
whereupon arthur expressed his grati-
tude in terms so elaborate that hogmanay
growled testily

  tush man ye dont need a dictionary
to say thank ye 

  in respect for macgregors feelings
catherine and garland preserved a discreet
silence on the subject of charteris escape
and barks version of the story apparently
satisfied his superiors inasmuch as nothing
that was official came of it

  and the following morning after a night
that was troubled and sleepless hogmanay
had a long and private conversation with
the great dane who from macgregors
standpoint was not nearly as grave as he
should have been

  as a matter of fact however hogmanays
story and his comments thereon made
parker do a great deal of thinking in a short
space of time but the audible expression
of his opinion when macgregor had finished
was as startling and facetious as it was
cryptic

  possibly the right thing to have done
he suggested soothingly would have been
to have held the guns over agwala while
charteris punched him

  hunh without a sign of a smile and
rising restlessly maybe yere right
a heavy pause im just afraid ye are
aye just that

  hogmanays bulk seemed to spread itself

devastatingly over the little library his
eyes smoldered and his great hairy hands
clenched with an eagerness that was most
suggestive

  dont get excited mac parker cau-
tioned quietly we havent nailed-

  excited im no excited a bit not a
bit and ye needna be afraid ill do any-
thing rash no me but ye canna expec
me to just sit when i ken deep down into
the marrow o me that its true

  no of course not agreeably but
were only guessing and until we find
doiidi- well that im afraid is going to
be as difficult as establishing proof even
when we do succeed in finding him also
charteris etcetera are no longer residents
at grandisons

 no

  not for the time being hell come
back of course but his stuff is gone so
i imagine he means to remain away quite a
while this time

  macgregor subsided slowly but he did
not sit down

 dod what a blind bat i was he
exclaimed suddenly

  not any blinder than the rest of us-
if it happens to work out that way
parker said placatingly i think we all
made the mistake of thinking abado the
cleverer of the two

  hes a better trader

  is he the great dane asked inno-
cently

  hogmanay glowered and thought a mo-
ment or two

  goin back on your promises isnt good
trading he declared in rumbling disagree-
ment

  no i suppose not nevertheless the
fat gentleman fooled hugh morrison and
im sure you will admit that was a con-
siderable achievement

  aye

  hogmanays eyes lighted up again but
only for a little while the sound of elsies
laughter came from the deck as tommy
dillingworth shot pat the library door in
obedient pursuit of a hard-hit tennis ball

  elsie has a bonny laugh hogmanay
said reflectively after a while too bonny
for this part o the world dont ye think
in view of whats what it would sound
better at forcados or thereaboot

  the great danes smile was a trifle
obscure


adventure

  all right if you can get them out of
here by the first of the month or before it
ill make you a present of a bit of the rope
we use

  thank ye but yere the man wi the
authority why dont ye exercise it

  parker got to his feet abruptly

  lets have a drink im as dry as a
barrel of lime

  hogmanay was agreeable enough but
before they passed out of the library he
had another thought

  youre kind o rash with your promises
o bits o rope arent ye

 why

  well cannily im just thinkin hed
be an awfu hard man to hang

catherines restless desire for
action was not so pronounced that
morning she looked just a little
subdued and if charteris name were men-
tioned she either ignored it altogether or
calmly changed the subject

  she allowed hogmanay to code her an-
swer to her mothers cable but no more
than that

  when mother begins to get our letters
im sure shell stop cabling and worrying
she said in defense of her determination to
remain and she will approve of every-
thing ive done shed do the same thing
in my place and probably not be nearly
so patient about it either

  macgregor smiled and did not dispute
the point mrs morrison was a calm
level-headed woman there was no question
about that but as she had married the
late hugh morrison without sacrificing an
atom of her natural assertiveness hog-
manay was conscious of no regret that she
had had the good sense to remain at home

  so that the bonny continued to rock
gently in midstream while the raw but
soundless intrigue of the bush crawled
creeper-like and with lightning speed
throughout the length and breadth of the
benin country silently reached out and up
into the land of the ibo even into the
street of nri and dipped down into the
villages of the chiefs of brass

  in the few succeeding days-days of
broiling heat and the weariness of a cramped
environment--a sullen heaviness seemed to
descend upon the face of the rumpled
waters

  and the natives who plied up and down

the river assumed an expression that
suggested they were  listening-always lis-
tening

  there was nothing imaginary about this
the sinister whispering voice of vengeance
that haunted the gloomy network of creeks
or ran breathlessly along the narrow bush
paths in the blackness of the night was
growing louder and louder

  in these few days where the creeks were
darkest men died suddenly and without
warning and their bodies slid gently into
mother nigers lap where the gurgling
rattle of complaint in their throats was
swiftly soothed into silence	

  whereupon their women donned their
oldest raiment and their brothers or sons
became avengers of their blood

  so that it was necessary for every man to
look behind him at frequent intervals and
canoes that had formerly traveled close
in to the bush sought the greater safety of
midstream

  by these signs was it known that at last
agwala had moved and like the great
black toad catherine had compared him
with he had wallowed from his cushions
of silk and the words he whispered into the
ears of men were immediately translated
into machete bladesmuzzle-loaders and
here and there an occasional rifle purloined
from the white man

  none of this was visible on the yacht
however even hogmanay and the great
dane had no proof of its actual existence
they knew simply of an unrest a-faintly
perceptible rustle and stir that would ul-
timately express itself in certain quarters
in a red trickle of blood

  merely as a precaution the watch on the
yacht was quietly doubled on the hulk
ancj marsdens beach the kroo headmen
were given monotoned orders to assign four
boys to night duty instead of the customary
one or two but aside from this indication
of possible strife the river was to all ap-
pearances quieter and more sober than at
any time since the bonny had arrived there

  in these few days too the cluster of
canoes about the hulk diminished almost
hourly

  as bart jardines stock of goods sank
lower and lower as he scurried frantically
about the hold in search of a possible bale or
case that might have been forgotten the
nondescript native traders who had poured
the wealth of the oil palm into his long lean
the gray charteris



hands drifted away from him to crowd
hogmanays breakwater or to proceed to
the business of emptying the warehouses
and shops of the siluko and koratown
independents

  up at grandisons beach ogulo-of-the-
long-arms slept by day and prowled more
cautiously than ever by night he was in
sole possession of the place and from a
governmental standpoint was not sup-
posed to be there at all

  therefore on an evening four days after
the disappearance of charteris when a pale
moon lurked intermittently behind scat-
tered banks of clouds and three indetermi-
nate shadows slipped in upon ogulo from
behind there was no one to whom the un-
gainly dwarf might have called for assis-
tance nothing between him and death save
the quickness of his ear the swiftness of his
foot and the ape-like length of his arms

  from right from left and from behind
the shadows leaped out of the weed-grown
clearing almost at ogulos feet and struck
with scarcely the sound of an indrawn
breath for warning

  with a low guttural of surprize ogulo
heard and sprang forward two of the
machete blades missed his head by a hair
the third gashed his shoulder but did not
halt him long enough for a second blow to
be struck he had no means of knowing
whether his assailants were three or thirty
and scurrying out of reach of those nearest
to him with astonishing rapidity he bolted
straight for the waterfront and plunged into
the swift running river

  his pursuers followed but only for a
little while swimming as in the jakri
country only ogulo-of-the-long-arms could
swim the dwarf speedily left the satellites
of agwala far behind and headed directly
for hogmanays breakwater

  arrived there he cautiously became pos-
sessed of a canoe that belonged to marsden
 co and without any compunction or
apologies he paddled out into mid-stream
and then headed straight up river

it was the following morning that
agwalas forty-paddle canoe swung
alongside marsden  cos gig-
wharf and hogmanay did not think it
surprizing that the paddle boys were silent

  neither was he in any way astonished by

the circumstance of the fat chiefs visit

but he was glad that tommy dillingworth -
  s

who had come over from the yacht with
elsie to play a game of billiards was on the
veranda at the time

  elsie was in the shop below just then
looking for a new pair of mosquito boots
small enough to fit her she did not really
need the boots but she thought she needed
the diversion of garlands service and ad-
miration and seated on a low pile of
gray flannel trousers at the far end of the
shop trying on mosquito boots elsie was
unquestionably a diversion worthy of any
shop clerks most devoted attention re-
gardless of how disillusioned and unsenti-
mental he might be

  afterward she was going over to the
kernel store to try to make the tall rather
dramatic-looking kernel clerk become confi-
dential from what she had seen of him
he looked as if he were struggling valiantly
with a secret sorrow and elsie liked to listen
and try to be helpful in cases of the kind

  agwala waddled up from the gig-wharf
and along hogmanays veranda with a
bloated look of injury on his face  when
he turned the corner so that he came into
full view macgregor put his hand on tom-
my dillingworths arm and said quietly
no keep your seat hell not stay
long

  hogmanay also remained seated and
there were no social or even amiable pre-
liminaries the expression on the big
scotch traders face was as dull and dead as
a barn door and he stroked his beard as if
he had no interest in the proceeding

  he did not offer agwala a chair and the
fat chief did not appear to want to sit
down he glanced questioningly at tommy
dillingworth leaned against a veranda up-
right and said heavily-

  whats matter you  pay proper price
for my oil

  your price too high macgregor
answered briefly

cha be same price you pay all time
too high hogmanay repeated simply
i no fit to sell oil for little bit price
agwala declared in the nature of an ultima-
tum

  and i no fit to buy it for big price
palaver set

  e-yaw

  the exclamation meant nothing it
simply gave expression to agwalas sur-
charged emotions as he was invited to look
the whole truth in the face
h

adventure

  you no want buy my oil he asked
smoothly after a while

 i want to buy all man oil-at my
price

  agwalas smile was sickly but there
was no manner of knowing what was actu-
ally passing in his mind he glanced at
tommy again merely as an excuse to take
his attention from hogmanay and then he
looked out toward the bonny and the
jardine hulk

  i go trade for hulk he said sullenly

  all right plenty canoe trade for
hulk

  agwala winced and drew away from the
rail macgregors sarcasm did not miss its
mark just at that moment the number of
canoes about the hulk was something less
than half a dozen consequently there
was no balm in that direction agwala
might sell for high prices on credit if he
cared to but he knew there was no cloth
or gin or salt or rice to be found anywhere--
except in the shops and warehouses of
marsden  co and the trading-companies
affiliated with it

  for a minute perhaps he stood flat-
footed facing hogmanay his great bulk
rocking slowly with a rage that was but
faintly expressed in the flatness of his eyes

 then suddenly macgregor rose and
tommy made a quick grab for his arm

  mac

  get off my beach

  careful mac youll kill him if you
hit him now

  macgregor paused and stiffened and
agwala backed slowly away muttering to
himself tommys hold on hogmanays
right arm tightened

  och why should i haud my hands

  it was almost a lament there was a
look in hogmanays normally twinkling
eyes that tommy had never seen before
agwala took his departure as hastily as
possible and waddled down to the gig-
wharf again macgregor stood between
two of the veranda uprights a large hand
wrapped about each of them and watched
every scuffling step the fat chief took

 he continued to watch as agwalas
canoe drew away from the gig-wharf and
headed as hogmanay thought for the
yacht but agwalas destination proved
to be the hulk and when macgregor was
sure of that he let his hands fall to his
sides and observedif or the first time in several
minutes that tommy was still at his elbow

  dod i hope hell no tempt me like
that again

to be concluded
n a certain day in the long ago
five gunmen descended from
surrounding hillsides and closed
in on henry madrigal cowman
who had assumed squatters rights in the
san andres mountains before government
surveyors had parceled out the country for
purposes of homesteading and purchase
madrigal fought a valorous but losing
battle drilling two of his assailants into
eternal silence before the combat reached
the hand-to-hand stage then he clubbed
his long-barreled six-shooter and rendered
two more temporarily helpless before a bul-
let nicked his valiant old heart

 madrigal lived long enough to demand
that some one look after his children-
a little boy and girl presumably waifs who
were known to be living with him they
had disappeared and the supposition was
that the killers had included them in their
slaughter but disposed of the bodies
ashamed of their inhumanity

  madrigal also during the last hours of
his life told sam barnhill owner of the
fying y in lurid and specific detail what
he thought of him

  then he died a martyr to the cause of
range freedom in traditions of the south-
west he still lives as a criterion of courage

  two of the gunmen of course required
nothing but burial for their services the
other pair apparently received what they
thought they were worth and left for parts
unknown

  zeigline the one killer who remained

on his feet when madrigal fell squatted on
the location until uncle sams engineers
platted plotted and surveyed the san
andres shortly thereafter title to the
madrigal place passed to barnhill-as
madrigal in his last moments had prophe-
sied it would zeigline received his pieces
of silver in live stock bearing a box x
brand-which analyzed was nothing more
or less than the madrigal m amplified
and doctored by the branding-iron

  even at that time barnhill was con-
trolling range factor his five thousand
head of cattle dotted the flats that spread
like a canopy at the eastern base of the san
andres madrigal had nested several
miles back in the mountains with a small
bunch of live stock this had made
madrigals western range boundary identi-
cal with the eastern limits of flying y
which was intolerable to barnhill who saw
in it a design to usurp his empire and steal
his cattle

  he had dealt with it accordingly vigor-
ously and expensively

  the old madrigal place thus became
one of the numerous flying y camps
later it was known as madrigal place
today it is referred to as madrigal

  after this experience barnhill looked to
his defenses determined never again to be
afflicted by nesters like many great
generals however he overlooked one strate-
gic position the hackberry hills bit a
right-angled chasm into the southwestern
extremity of the flats and constituted a

ji
ii

adventure

no mans land into which flying y
cattle seldom ventured because of its
remoteness from water

  barnhill never bothered to acquire title
in the hackberry hills because everyone
took it for granted that his control
included them

gf thus for almost three decades
vi sam barnhill dominated the range
unmolested by nesters then louis
bern returned to new mexico from the
nowhere and everywhere of cattle ranges in
canada chile mexico and points con-
tingent thereto and remote therefrom

  berns appearance was not hailed as a
return he had departed the country
unknown and returned equally so he took
nothing for granted but looked up land
office records and discovered that hack-
berry hills were open territory

  he entered into a partnership with the
youthful ebullient and wholly efficient
thad wyman and developed a ranch con-
sisting of two-room bunk-house corral
wagon-shed well and several hundred
head of cattle which fattened in the grama-
grassed hills and valleys

  among other things bern brought back
with him forty years of ripe experience
the muscularity of youth and a keen desire
to plant his wandering foot where it would
take root

  the tradition that a rolling stone gathers
no moss held true with bern likewise the
axiom that an itinerant pebble acquires a
polish more desirable than any lichenic
growth the physical burnishing was man-
ifested in the smooth bronze of his always
clean-shaved face where character lines
were etched lightly due to the firm flesh
underneath preventing deeper inroads the
mental refinement was reflected in his
speech due probably to a painstaking study
of pure castilian-a sure guide to perfect
english-and an ability to quote shakespere
with ease and accuracy

  bern had drunk of the rio grande years
before and had responded to another tra-
dition that when you drink of the rio
grande you must return before you die
bern was far from dead but he answered to
the lure of the muddy waters nevertheless
he returned not to die but to live to
be sure the rio grande flowed ten miles
west of the hackberry hills-but tradition
is allowed that much latitude

  a bond of affection admiration and re-
spect linked bern and his youthful partner
quite aside from their business relationship
friends characterized them as tiger and
cub each was all to the other and they
reveled in their plans work and play

  only one place in the world id rather
own than this bern was wont to comment
luxuriously after a hard day in the saddle
when he and thad were enjoying their
after-supper smokes and thats madrigal
place theres the last word in cow
ranches-big mountains living springs
pine-trees and range almost unlimited
a real place for a home and barnhill
doesnt appreciate it to him its just
one of the camps

  and thad as regularly unfolded his
secret

  barnhill only thinks he owns madrigal
the forty acres he holds patent to are lo-
cated nearly a quarter-mile from the
springs accordin to the way land office
records tally out with a secret survey i had
made why dont we grab it

  either the boss chainman miscounted
his chain lengths while runnin his line
from the township comer-stake-which is
plum easy t do-or else the transitman
trusted to his memory stead o his note-
book mebbe some land office clerk thought
he knowed better how t describe the land
than barnhill did-an put it down south-
west quarter stead o southeast quarter
range section township so-an-so half the
patents in this country are held on faulty de-
scriptions-you know that louis-only
neighbors dont genrally bother each other
because theyre friendly an trust each
other barnhill he dont trust any one-
an id sure admire t hang his hide on the
barn-door i dont care whose barn it
is so longs the hides ol sams

 what has barnhill done to you
bern would counter

  nothin but you know how he come
into possession of it-hirin gunmen to kill
off old henry madrigal an then buyin a
relinquishment from zeigline with hanks
own cattle weve got as much right to it
as he has

  if i could be certain that barnhill was

behind the murder of madrigal-

  bern never finished his soliloquy because
thad was at him immediately with proof
evidence legend and hearsay
s barnhill unintentionally furnished the
uncle henry would enjoy this



partners with an important part of their
amusement he hired a cattle detective
on the assumption that they were stealing
his live stock goren the detective ear-
nestly endeavored to catch bern or wyman
in the act of rustling but had indifferent
luck because no thievery took place
furthermore the partners developed a dis-
concerting habit of doubling on their
trails and coming up in his fear to rebuke
his suspicious nature the bewildered ex-
pression on gorens face at such times pro-
vided them with merriment for days after-
ward

  one day however bern tired of this
pastime and advised goren that his presence
was no longer and never had been desired
on b w range in an official capacity
thereafter they saw no sign of him until
the september afternoon when bern cut the
trail of gorens horse leading from flying

y	plains country into the rocky inception of
b w range

  interesting and undoubtedly true
bern mused studying the tracks carefully-
he knew the hoof imprint of every horse in
goren string of mounts 

  the trail led through a pass in the red
rimrocks and then angled south where it
was joined by another

  thads bern chuckled he must
have seen goren coming they both
stopped their horses and evidently had a
chat wonder what it was about

  wonderment increased to anxiety when
bern noticed that thad had reined along-
side goren and accompanied him on the
southerly course

  he looked full at the sinking sun medita-
tively

  its time that boy was back at the
ranch he decided but judging from the
freshness of the tracks and the direction
they take he wont get there for some time
the ranch lay to the northwest goren
must have gotten him interested in some-
thing to lead him down here at this time
of day

  another half-mile south the tracks of the
two horses led into a rocky canon so desti-
tute of grass that cattle rarely strayed
into it

  strange place to go bern muttered
never was here but once before myself
and i dont think thad ever rode this
canon

  he spurred his mount a magnificent

blood-bay to a fast trot daylight would
soon fade and he felt the necessity of follow-
ing the trail to its logical conclusion this
was the most isolated part of b w range
and bern was reasonably curious to know
the reason for the pilgrimage

  he rounded a sharp jut in the canon and
solved the problem all in the same instant

  gruya thads mount stood riderless
nickering into a yawning prospect-hole
which had been abandoned many years
before by the discouraged miner who dug it

  berns mental eye beheld the scene of
tragedy as it must have been enacted he
reconstructed the-events leading up to it
goren had lured thad into the desolate
canon on some plausible pretext and then
catching his victim off guard the cattle de-
tective had either pushed or knocked him
into the pit boot tracks of both men
offered eloquent testimony and bern over-
looked nothing

  bern hurled himself from the saddle
his copper-hued face faded to a subdued
pink and bellied his way to the crumbling
brink of the shaft

  thad he shouted into the darkness-
and the name rose up from the depths in
echo to mock him

  thad again he called-and the re-
bound of his voice ascended with a force
that seemed to smother him

  bern had to summon all his reserve
courage to make his third attempt to rouse
thad-

  if you are alive thad in the name of
god answer me

  from the confused jumble of noise re-
bounding from the bottom and sides of the
abyss came the last three words clear as if
shot from a sounding board-

  god answer me

  bern snapped to a sitting position and
clapped hands to ears the ghastly reper-
cussion unnerved him

  action served as a sedative

  knotting the rope which he took from
gruyas saddle he tied it to his own a
heavy rock secured to the sixty foot length
dangled in midair

  tense despair gripped bern

   god answer me  he quoted the re-
sounding words that had leered at him
from the open grave what shall i do
thad is gone dead and i cant even
get his body

  for a moment bern stood motionless
	adventure

his active brain grappling with the situa-
tion the last glow of sunlight illumined
his features into a semblance of some heroic-
sized bronze medallion the same glint of
light caught dazzlingly at the smooth
inner surface of his leather chaps where they
had been worn shiny by his knee-grip on
the saddle

  then decision animated his muscles

  a flying leap carried him to redmans
back and spurs roweled the big bay to a
frenzied speed up the hillside where led the
tracks of a lone rider-the rider who had
been with thad up to the time they had
approached the prospect-hole

sweat blackened redmans neck
as he held the terrific pace re-
sponding to berns commands of
voice and steel bern knew that he must
sight goren before dark otherwise the
chase would be indefinitely prolonged
goren might even escape

  the trail led down into the next caiion
and showed that goren was traveling easily
apparently without fear of pursuit the
isolated position of granite canon-where
the crime was committed-with the meager
possibility that any one would invade it
for months gave goren a sense of security

  the chase led diagonally through hack-
berry hills toward the flats and redman
quickly closed the intervening distance
when dusk faded bern decided that goren
could not be more than a mile ahead and
guided his horse up a little pinnacle that
commanded a view of the next canon

  the sight of a lazily moving horseman in
the hazy depths below inspired bern to a
gutteral exclamation of joy-choked back
barely in time to save him from discovery
as it was goren turned in his saddle-
listening for a sound that he thought he
heard bern thought for an instant that
goren saw him but continued to freeze
in his place of semiconcealment behind the
scraggly limbs of a scrub cedar until the
man disappeared around a turn in the
canon	

  bern played a one-sided game of hide and
seek for the next half-hour he rode the
ridges with utmost caution stopping every
few minutes to listen as darkness shrouded
the hills he followed goren by sound al-
ways he rode a little faster than the man he
was following and gradually he widened
the circle until finally he was in the lead

  then he left redman and taking his
saddle-rope with him crept silently down
the hillside where he stationed himself in
protecting shadow of a giant clump of
mesquite	

  gorens first knowledge that he was not
alone came when a swish of rope warned
him-too late a noose settled and tight-
ened about his neck he loosed the bridle
reins to grapple with the strangling hemp
and was jerked unceremoniously from the
saddle he hit the ground heavily and
before he could recover bern was upon
him with the ferocity of a jungle beast and
the science of a wrestler

  face down in the shale rock and sand
the cattle detective fought viciously against
a paralyzing leg-hold bern shifted to a
sitting position in the middle of gorens
back always drawing the tortured leg to-
ward him until the struggles ceased and
agonized profanity began then he used
one hand to snatch gorens gun from its
holster

  pardon my seeming roughness bern
panted throwing a double half-hitch around
gorens ankles with the loose end of the
rope but im in a hurry and cant stop
to argue

  he hastily dallied the lariats remain-
ing slack around his own leg and increased
the tension to maintain the leverage on
gorens limbs drawing a hogging-string
from his belt with which he-trussed gorens
wrists

  bern made short work of freeing himself
from the rope retrieving gorens mount-
which had stopped to graze outside the
danger zone-and cutting from the saddle
the leather thongs that under happier
circumstances were used for packing pur-
poses from these he fashioned another
tie-rope and used it to replace that portion
of the lariat binding gorens ankles he
also removed the noose from the detectives
neck and delivered a few succinct remarks
while coiling up the rope

  this may seem a trifle unnecessary to
you but just now im in need of an extra
length of rope for the purpose of getting my
partners body from that prospect hole
also i want to be sure youll be here when i
get back see you in about an hour and a
half and then-ill settle with you

  bern started to leave then hesitated
he came back and observed gorens
tumble-bug efforts to free himself
uncle henry would enjoy this



   ill just fix you so ill be fairly sure to
find you when i return he remarked

  he unsaddled the horse carried goren to
a scrub cedar and cinched the saddle
around both man and tree-trunk

  goren protested luridly

  anything you say may be used against
you bern warned with a sort of deadly
playfulness better save it youll need
everything you have when i get back

the autumn chill inspired goren
to efforts at escape he knew that
the double-half hitches knotted be-
hind him at ankles and wrists held him se-
cure the saddle held him immovably in
place but wriggling and squirming kept his
blood more actively in circulation then
the sudden thought that bern in retrieving
the body of his partner would learn defi-
nitely how he came to his death twisted
gorens swarthy mustachioed face into a
grimace of fear and he set to work in earnest
to free himself from bondage

  he leaned back on the fleece-lined inner
surface of the saddle and pressed down it
slipped a trifle as the circingles stretched
he repeated the operation again and again
sweating copiously with the labor an hour
passed and the saddle was midway past
his hips

  goren paused for rest and reflection
if he could free himself of the saddle it
wouldnt be much of a trick to hop to a
sharp-edged rock and saw his wrist mana-
cles apart time was all he needed he
calculated how long bern would be gone
it would take him at least twenty minutes to
ride the five mountainous miles to granite
canon

  then-how long would it take for two
horses pulling at a ninety-foot length of
saddle rope to drag bern and his inanimate
burden from the shaft goren pondered
it couldnt be done the dead weight of a
yearling on the end of a thirty-foot rope
was all the average cow-pony could move
more than double that weight on even a
sixty-foot rope would either stall two horses
or break the rope

  ninety feet of it would be impossible
bern would discover this only after experi-
ment that might be disastrous at least
it would delay him while he figured out
some other plan then he would have to
dispose of the body would he take it to
the b w ranch probably the county

coroner would be called in to determine
officially the cause of death and he would
find-

  goren had enjoyed meditation on the
time element but a forecast of the coroners
findings with bern to assist spurred him to
further activity he had to escape or bern
would kill him if bern didnt the law
would

  the saddle slipped gratifyingly after
another fifteen minutes of writhing and
pushing it fell to the ground and the leather
skirts pinioned his spurs he kicked them
free bent over to find a fairly soft place on
the hillside where he could rest his head-
and then somersaulted from his saddle
prison

  a jagged rock freed his hands after
several minutes of awkward sawing and his
pocket-knife cut the ankle-thongs all he
had to do now was to catch his horse saddle
him and leave promptly in a southerly di-
rection he started to unfasten the cinch-
buckles from around the cedar wondering
where bern might be and what doing-
when he heard the clattering hoof-beats of a
galloping horse on the ridge to the north

  he knew then that bern had upset the
time calculation in some manner and had
returned a full five minutes too soon
goren abandoned the saddle and rushed
toward his horse-which shied at his hasty
approach goren cursed and made a futile
grab at the trailing bridle-reins as redman
came slithering down the slant with bern
swaying easily in the saddle uttering
ironical comment and advice

  speed up goren youre slow as a drag
cows tail do i note by the dim starlight
that you were about to leave bare-back

  bern hurled himself from redmans
back six-shooter in hand goren dashed
behind a boulder

  come out of there bern snapped
you cant hole up like a ground-hog
come out this way and i wont shoot
start in any other direction and ill fill you
full of lead

  goren appeared hands elevated

  now bern told him put your hands
down i know youre not heeled you
need killing but i can use you alive to bet-
ter advantage youre going with me to
my ranch and there with all the comforts of
home at your disposal write a confession
about how you killed thad wyman-and
why


adventure

    a remonstrance surged as high as gorens
  larynx-and died there to the click of
  berns gun he thought about his knife
  buried snug and useless in the trousers
  pocket under his chaps

    roughly bern rambled on it will run
  something like this you met wyman at the
  b w range-border and roused his curiosity
  about the shaft which hed never seen be-
  cause none of our cattle ever go into
  granite canon and consequently he hadnt
  been there the two of you dismounted
  and wyman was looking into the hole when
  you hit him on the back of the head with a
  rock he fell in and the rock went with
  him i found it beside him any re-
  marks to make

    youre so wise goren sneered edging
  closer maybe you know that flyin y
  cows sometimes stray there

   you ought to know you rode b w
 range for months before i ordered you off
 perhaps a dozen a year stray into granite
 canon i saw one there tonight

   this was interesting information to

-	goren he hadnt seen any he wanted
 to know about it but other things were
 more vital

 an what makes you think i clouted
 wyman with the dornic you found by his
 body wasnt there any others near him
 yes but none others with hair and
 blood

   goren had maneuvered within striking
 distance and sprang his nose collided
 violently with berns left fist

    i hoped youd do something like that
  bern told him tossing the pistol into a bed
  of gravel my hands itch for the feel of
  you your guns in one of redmans
  saddle-pockets mine is where you see it-
  behind me get them if you think you can
  wade through me

    this was a chance goren hadnt antici-
  pated bare fists against a man twenty
  pounds lighter than himself who insanely
  threw away his advantage catch-as-catch
  can-grapple-kick goren knew the
  rough-and-tumble game let him once

 get his arms around bern-

   he rushed bern drove an accurate
 one-two into the detectives midriff and
 followed with a hurricane of staggering
 blows to the face goren shook blood from
 his eyes and waded in for more crowding
 bern back toward the faint glint of the
 blued colt his arms flailed the air with a

windmill motion and he felt he was making
progress in spite of the fearful punishment
he was taking

  bern retreated before the onslaught of
superior weight until his boot-heel rested
on the butt of the six-shooter then he
planted himself and shot his fist with the
full power of shoulder and body behind it
to a point slightly below gorens left ear
the detectives feet cleared the ground and
he lay unconscious where he fell while
bern picked up the gun

  he was still prostrate after bern had
caught and saddled the flying y pony it
required the cold steel of a gun-barrel at the
back of his neck to revive him

  any further remarks before you write
the confession bern inquired

  not none

  goren mounted tears of agony crept
from his battered eyes and scalded his
abraised cheeks his nose had been
wrecked and faultily repaired at some for-
mer date its condition was now hopeless

   cept id like to know how you got
wyman out o that shaft so quick saddle
ponies never drug you out

  of course not bern laughed as he rode
beside his unfettered prisoner with a pecu-
liar exultation that puzzled goren i
didnt even try to use the horses didnt
it occur to you that i might anchor one
end of the rope to a boulder and climb out
hand-over-hand with wyman lashed to
my back

  nuh-uh was gorens ambiguous reply
he looked at bern in the faulty light with
a new appreciation he tested his jaw
by moving it clockwise on its hinges and
shook his head to determine whether his
brains were still in place he understood
now why berns hitting powers had the
qualities of a mules kick prodigious
brawn was required to pull a weight of over
three hundred pounds seventy-five feet
straight up with nothing but an occasional
toe-hold to assist

pf the darkest part of the moonless
night was upon flying y head-
quarters when goren rode behind
the high adobe wall that formed the east
side of the corral he spoke harshly to a
companion rider who responded

  be quiet nobody must wake up ex-
cept barnhill take off your spurs-take
mine off too
uncle henry would enjoy this



  goren complied in utter silence

  the men tiptoed to barnhills quarters
in the north end of the long adobe building
that also housed the flying y cowboys at
the southern extremity

  goren tapped on the window while his
associate partially hid behind the north wall

  barnhill was evidently a light sleeper for
he responded without delay opening the
window

  come outside goren whispered after
a hasty glance convinced him that the
other man was still on the job and keenly
alive to his every movement

  barnhill grunted

  guess id better mrs barnhills asleep
in the next room an might hear us

  ffteen seconds perhaps intervened be-
tween acquiescence and appearance barn-
hill shirtless and carpet-slippered stepped
through the aperture and sat down on the
ground shivering beside his employe his
back to the east wall of the house

i got wyman goren announced sourly
good the cattleman growled through
the bushy mustache that completely ob-
scured his mouth even in daylight did
you finlly catch him stealin stock

  nope i dont think hes ever rustled
a hoof off you

  youre a fool barnhill grunted why
elsed him an bern locate where they did-
right alongside my range

  good grass in those hills goren sug-
gested likely place to build up a herd
sure-build it up at my expense im
satisfied theyve been robbin me blind-
same as ol henry madrigal use to do before
he got his thats why i hired you-an
youd a caught both of em cold if youd
been onto your job

  silence from goren he answered only
after his employer inquired testily-
how did you work it to get wyman
then

  i led him down a canon in the hack-
berries an hit him on the head with a dornic
while he was peerin down a seventy-five
foot prospect-hole

  the detective spoke without pride almost
it seemed with reluctance

  serves him right the - thief

barnhill commended wish his pardner
was there too but suppose some one
finds the body

  no one hardly ever goes into that
canon goren replied peevishly an

what if they do itll look like he fell in
the falls enough t kill him even if i
hadnt cracked him with a rock i left
his horse standin there sos itd look plum
natural if any one should happen along
in case they dont the horsell wander home
after a while an the countrys that rough
he couldnt be back-trailed

  sounds reasonable barnhill applauded
in guarded tones then cautiously
howre you goint keep folks from talkin
about you gettin in so late the handsll
all know what time you slip into the bunk-
house

  im leavin the coimtry tonight goren
announced an want my pay its three
hundred an twenty-five bucks

  how come barnhill inquired in the
manner of one who knows the answer to his
own question

  i got twenty-five cornin for the last two
weeks ridin an three hundred which you
promised if i got either bern or wyman
he spoke with some animation glancing at
the north wall of the adobe well-i got
wyman

  barnhill demurred

  how do i know except by your say-so
that youve earnt the bonus besides
what makes you think ive got that much
money on me

  youve got it less you lied goren
answered the last question you told me
this mornin-or yestday mornin-before
i left here that the cash was in the safe in
your office you said further that itd
stay there ten days less i claimed it sooner
on account o breakin up th b w com-
bination if i didnt qualify for it in that
time i was to get th gate three hundred
for either pardner-seven-fifty for both-
was the agreement

  ones all i care t collect on you go
get the money an ill furnish proof that
wymans dead

  barnhill climbed into the window and
goren found time for a snatch of conversa-
tion with the man in hiding

  faint signs of dawn streaked the east
when the cattleman emerged from the
room his hands were full of greenbacks
and his eyes naturally protuberant were
filled with amazement as he stared at his
employe

  howd your face get that-a-way he
demanded it looks like the last act in a
barbecue


adventure

  i had a fall goren explained
lookin this way is one reason im in a
hurry to leave here

   horse fall with you

   no i fell off him gorens temper was
 wearing to a thin edge and his reply was
 acid say do i have to wait here till
 noon or do i get that money before its
 -good daylight

   soons i get proof that wymans been
 accounted for barnhill reluctantly talked
 business though still fascinated by the
 bruised and gory appearance of the detec-
 tives features show me somethin be-
 longin t wyman-

   goren interrupted wearily and rudely 
  somethin belongin to wyman all
 right howll bern do step out

   he called to the man around the corner
 barnhills startled vision followed the
 direction of gorens last two words and his
 angular frame almost collapsed at sight of
 bern advancing from his place of conceal-
 ment	

   bern approached leisurely his  caliber
 six-shooter preceeding him with sinister
 smoothness

   if the avenging angel with flaming sword
 had made its appearance at that moment
 the effect on the flying y owner might have
 been slightly more enervating-though that
 is doubtful enervation was sufficiently
 complete to enable goren to pluck the blood
 money from his employers nerveless hands
 -convincing evidence that mr barnhill
 was not his normal tight-fisted self or
 perhaps he was satisfied with gorens proof
 of fidelity to orders

   goren left without troubling to count the
 currency

   bern spoke first the flash from his blue
 eyes-now visible in the semi-light adding a
 certain meaning to his softly spoken words
 mr goren neglected to mention i be-
 lieve that he was overtaken by the surviv-
 ing member of the b w outfit that will
 explain perhaps the condition of his
 none-too-grecian features but modesty
 forbids me to give the painful details
 perhaps i was a trifle testy knowing as i
 did that hed sent my partner to the bottom
 of a seventy-five-foot shaft

   barnhills comment indicated an entire
 lack of sympathy for either partner-

   ive been double-crossed by that-

   -cross between a barbed-wire fence and
 a skunk bern supplied amiably

  however he didnt double-cross you
voluntarily surely he wouldnt abuse the
confidence of so splendid a gentleman as
yourself

  the silken irony caused barnhill real
discomfort he choked back an oath and
bit a perceptible chunk from his mustache
bern continued amiably

  passing lightly over unessentials mr
goren became sufficiently penitent to ac-
company me to b w ranch where he
penned a complete confession youwill be
interested to learn that this confession of a
not-too-penitent soul contained your name
no less than twenty-one times and would
seem to incidate that he had embarked on
his career of crime to save his job

  why did yu let him get away
barnhill snarled regaining his natural
poise dont devil me with his doins
ill be perfectly frank with you bern
pursued genially modulating his voice as he
heard voices in the bunk-room i let
goren escape because i promised to do so
your recent transaction with him shows the
sacredness with which you regard a prom-
ise so i know you will understand why i
kept mine-when i explain

  goren bought his chance to escape by
writing the confession and by leading me to
this place where i could hear you express
yourself with such a charming lack of self-
restraint i might add that goren knew
that a gun was trained on him during all the
time he was making his report to you and
that it would never have been completed if
he had warned you that there was a witness
if he had failed me i would have killed him
without more ado-and slightly less regret
go ahead an kill him barnhill sug-
gested helpfully he can still be over-
taken an youve give him his chance
you have followed my recital with dili-
gent care bern reproved him but you
never seem to get ahead of me wouldnt it
be an act of rare discretion on your part
to offer me hush money somewhat on the
order of your arrangement with zeigline
after he and his companions killed henry

madrigal-

  bern had expected an outburst at this
suggestion instead barnhill snatched
eagerly at it-

  howd five hundred dollars do

  bern controlled his emotions but a new
quality crept into his voice-

  come around to the north side of the
uncle henry would enjoy this



 house where we wont be seen when the
 boys come out of the bunk-room

    barnhill obeyed uneasily wondering what
  counter-proposition he would have to deal
  with but relieved when bern sheathed
  his gun

   when i came back to new mexico i
 heard-and only half-believed-the story
 about henry madrigals being killed at your
 orders the fact that -zeigline apparently
 got nothing but the madrigal m cattle-
 changed to a box x-for his relinquish-
 ment to the place gave it some semblance of
 foundation i know that you rode up to
 the madrigal place a very few minutes
 after the old man was killed too and were
 apparently on friendly terms with the
 gunmen-but that didnt prove anything
 my impression was that the dirty cowards
 who hire assassins for their work lived only
 in fiction however the business of this
 night conduces me that at least one is alive
 if that wasnt enough your remark of a few
 minutes ago would be plenty

    barnhill snarled again

   were dealin with the present the
 past is dead an buried

    in one sense only is it dead and buried
  the present links itself with the past rather
  importantly bern retorted youll re-
  member the two children orphans who
  were living with henry madrigal at the
  time your men killed him well-im one
  of them the other was my sister cudgel
  your memory a bit and see if you cant
  remember that the childrens names were
  -louis and louise

    it was evident from barnhills ghastly
 pallor that he did

    sis and i were back in the hills gathering
  wild raspberries when the shooting began
  she ran i after her and we got back in time
  to see uncle henry-yes he was my
  mothers brother-lying apparently dead
  and strangers in possession of the place
  we didnt know exactly what it all meant
  but we decided that men who would kill
  lovable old uncle henry would do the
  same to us so we didnt give them the
  chance we tramped to roswell-and it
  was a hideous trip for us kids sis was nearly
  dead when we arrived i got a job as er-
  rand boy in a grocery store later i worked
  as a horse-wrangler and sent louise to new
  england where we had some distant rela-
  tives then i started out to see the world
  ive seen it now and came back here to

settle down because i love the country-it
contains the only memories of a home that
i can remember-uncle henry had moth-
ered louise and me since we were babies
henry madrigals nephew barnhill
found his voice after exercising his adams
apple for several minutes

  yes bern answered levelly and
youve sent your killers against the two
men who have been the best friends ive
ever known one substituted for my
mother-and did as good a job of it as any
man could do the other my pal-you
probably dont know what the word means
in its glorified sense-the sort that id
liked to have had as a son if id ever mar-
ried you even cost me the privilege of
growing up with my sister-she died ten
years ago-by destroying our home

  in view of these things im going to sell
the b w ranch to you-at my price
my reasons are i suppose obvious to you-
i dont want it because of the associated
memories ill sell the whole layout lock
stock and barrel reserving only the saddle-
horses for twenty thousand dollars
barnhill stared glassily at the northern
horizon

  do i understand that wymans disap-
pearance will always remain one o the mys-
teries of this country in case i buy at your
price he asked biting another section
from the overhanging brush on his upper
lip thats a full five thousand moren
the outfits worth its a hold-up

  it may be bern snapped in a tone
that roused barnhill to the need for more
guarded utterance but its not murder
i need twenty thousand to carry out a plan
that thad would approve hes often
mentioned it but theres always been an
obstacle in the way and im willing for the
sake of accomplishing this thing to keep
quiet about gorens confession

  id suggest therefore he concluded
briskly that you make out your check for
the amount named and we will then proceed
to marona-the county seat-in your high-
powered flivver where the cashier will do
some certifying where it will do the most
good also we can complete the transaction
while were there and b w will belong to
you before the day is over

  but how can you give title to the place
without certifyin to wymans death
barnhill inquired

  quitclaim thads idea bern replied


adventure

tersely when we found that youd put
a detective on our trail he insisted that
we each quitclaim to the other in case of
accidents i thought it was useless-but i
see now that he knew your caliber

  wheres yur horse demanded barn-
hill with sudden animation

  behind the corral bern told him
promptly sensing and sympathizing with
barnhills desire for secrecy

  get im quick lead im around here
unsaddle throw your kak inside this door
an ride bareback into the horse pasture
while i jockey my car out o the wagonshed
ill pick you up in about five minutes
snappy now before any o the hands
tumble out o the bunk-house an see you
bern was on his way he knew that
redman sweat-stained and leg-weary
would betray his nocturnal visit to the
horse-wrangler who would be on the job
within fifteen minutes-but that was some-
thing for barnhill to worry about specu-
lation would be rampant among the flying

y	cowboys immediately upon discovery of
berns horse in flying y pasture-and
barnhill could think of his own explana-
tions

barnhills sense of business
acumen was outraged by the price
he was called upon to pay for a two
by twice cattle outfit the same inner
prompting however told him that while
the monetary consideration was far above
the market value it bought a protection
worth infinitely more-if bern wouldkeep
his promise to remain silent

  he decided that the next time he re-
quired the private and violent services of a
cattle detective he would hire someone who
knew the value of a clean getaway

  a lurking suspicion that he was being
victimized found expression as he was
piloting his runabout along the sandy road
to marona

  say he jerked out we dont do any
business till i see that confession you say
goren wrote

  bern who had been soliloquizing on the
softness of saddles as compared with the
once springy seat he now shared with
barnhill smiled easily

  im surprized you didnt think of that
before while youre busy with that steer-
ing wheel ill just spread it out for your
inspection it would seem though he

rebuked his companion that you might
be willing to take the word of a trusted
employe who reported the work done thus
showing great fidelity to your interests
barnhills jaw muscles moved as if his
tongue had been inspired to voice a fitting
rejoinder-then relaxed bern reached into
his inside vest pocket-he wore no coat-
and produced the document which he held
where barnhill could read it

  the contents evidently made unpleasant
reading matter

  he lies was the only comment

  your soft impeachment would sound a
trifle more chummy if i hadnt been an ear-
and eye-witness to your cheerful conver-
sation with goren bern remarked return-
ing the paper to his pocket perhaps as
additional proof youd like to inspect the
shaft in granite canon i could let you
down with a rope

  barnhills rugged features registered irri-
tation at the first part of berns comment
and a violent distaste at the latter he
was sufficiently in berns power now without
submitting to being tied to one end of a
rope over which bern had complete control

  the gasoline sand-boat did most of the
talking for the remainder of the fifty-five
mile trip to marona and conversation in
that bustling county seat was confined
strictly to the business of purchase and sale
of b w ranch and cattle	m

  bern thanked barnhill cordially for the
offer-which was not made-of a ride back
to flying y headquarters and requested
that his horse be kept in pasture until
called for

  im headed south on the evening train
bern confided and you probably wont
see me for some time 

  mr barnhills mobile features again
registered a sentiment which bern inter-
preted to mean that if the flying y owner
never saw him again that would be soon
enough

       the following week provided in-
ijjsgp terest for all persons who knew
thad wyman louis bern or goren
the purchase of b w by barnhill would
have caused little comment had it not been
accompanied by the disappearance of both
partners and the flying y rider rumor
from marona had it that bern alone repre-
sented b ws interests at the sale and
that he used a quitclaim to complete legal
uncle henry would enjoy this



formalities it became known too that
berns mount remained at flying y while
gruya wymans favorite pony had been
at the home ranch when barnhills cowboys
tallied out the newly purchased live stock

  barnhill for reasons of personal policy
kept his own counsel with regard to bern
and wyman and explained the departure
of goren on the grounds of an urgent mes-
sage from home folks in texas

  another phase of barnhills personal
policy induced him to drive into tedler-
shipping-point post-office and merchan-
dising center of that territory eleven miles
north of the ranch-to ask hal currie the
deputy sheriff whether anything had been
heard about bern or wyman he was
anxious tp learn whether any foul play
was suspected or discussed

  curries mouth being too full for polite
utterance at the moment he emptied it of
liquid content before replying then he
said he reckoned bern and wyman knew
what they were doing and would show up
when they got good and ready

  the trip to town was not however with-
out thrills for barnhill

  a letter postmarked el paso sent him
flying to the hotel telephone after being
connected with a marona number he gave
excited directions and waited perspiringly
for a return call when it came after a
half-hour interval he swore venomously into
the transmitter and ordered that a sur-
veying crew be shipped to tedler on the
afternoon train

  emerging sweatily from the phone booth
he drew the letter from his pocket and re-
read it to assure himself that he hadnt
excited himself unduly

  he had not the letter read

el paso sept 

dear mr barnhill

  this will introduce the t l cattle company
which respectfully requests the immediate removal
of all flying y cattle from the water known as
madrigal

  this land we are informed has long been con-
sidered flying y property but a survey made pre-
liminary to our purchase of same from the govern-
ment proves otherwise your holdings some forty
acres secured by patent are located about four
hundred yards south of the ground you claim

  our leases in addition to what we have acquired
by purchase fully protect our interest in the range
while of course your cattle have a perfect right to
graze on the forty acres you own the range will i
think prove too limited and dry for either comfort
to them or profit to you

   i will take this opportunity to make an appoint-
ment with you at the tedler hotel for the morning of
october  i will arrive on number four which is
due at  better make it about the time of my
arrival as a trainload of t l cattle will land in
tedler shortly after the passenger the stock will
be driven to madrigal immediately as the four-
hour ride from el paso will not necessitate their
being held for rest in the stock pens

yours very truly

louis bern manager

  citizens of tedler contend that barnhill
frothed at the mouth that last day of sep-
tember and cursed lawyers surveyors and
louis bern with equal and animated feroc-
ity he talked mostly to himself but hal
currie overtook him on the board sidewalk
in front of elliotts store after hearing the
name of bern mentioned hotly

  do i gather that you heard from
louis bern currie inquired sociably
lighting a long crooked stogie

  blah-or words to that effect-an-
swered the harassed cattleman

  does he say where hes been or what
hes doin the plump deputy pursued the
subject apparently absorbed in the sput-
tering end of his smoke

  he looked up expecting a reply then in
utter surprize he craned his neck owl-like
and saw barnhill stumping angrily in the
direction whence he had come

    j barnhills operations during the
next forty-eight hours subsequent to
the receipt of berns letter were
guided largely by three important con-
siderations first the surveyors hired by
him verified berns statement that madrigal
was not flying y property second bern
was possessed of information and proof that
would ruin him and third barnhill though
an oppressor and a bully felt a very personal
and physical fear of the bronzed cowman
who spoke with sardonic gentleness while
his eyes glittered with a menace of sudden
death

  the cattleman seated on the tedler hotel
gallery waiting for the arrival of number
four reflected moodily on the scurvy trick
played by the rio grande in reaching out
to the ends of the world and bringing back
the man who as a child had drunk of its
turgid waters

  this circumstance was no less incredible-
and no less true-than the fate that had
caused him to cross the trail of louis bern
the nephew of henry madrigal twenty-nine


adventure

years after the old pioneer had laid down
his life for the same underlying cause that
brought about the original conflict

  most unbelievable of all was that bern
of the madrigal blood should come into
possession of the hills and valleys his uncle
lost-after fighting and dying for them

  number four steamed into the station
where most of tedlers population-some
three hundred when they were all at home-
was gathered

  amazement and joy held them speechless
as louis bern descended the day coach
steps then

  thought youd left us for keeps

  how come

  welcome to our fond embrace greeted
him

  hand clasps and slaps on the back-also
a trampling of his toes which were clad in
a pair of new elegantly stitched riding-
boots-followed berns weathered face
relaxed into smile-lines and crows feet as
he shook sinewy paws two at a time

  i didnt think any oned miss me he
declared happily only been gone a little
over a week

  some one asked wheres thad and
bern pretended not to hear he whisked
off his gray undented wide-brimmed hat-
also new-and cleared a path for himself

  see you all later and talk till im out of
breath he promised them but i cant
stop now got an appointment to meet mr
barnhill at the hotel

  a half-dozen cowboys and citizens were
still at his sides and heels when he ap-
proached barnhill

  the rancher without offering to shake
hands suggested that they retire to his room
on the second floor

  more privacy he recommended sig-
nificantly eying berns retinue of followers

  the lone chair in barnhills room induced
bern to park himself on the bed

  i judge you got my letter bern opened
fire smilingly

  a wry twist of the cattlemans mouth
answered he was looking out of the
window

  is there anything further for us to mill
over bern inquired

  yes there is barnhill stormed sud-
denly jumping to his feet ive got all
possible o my cattle moved from madrigal
but theres still five thousand dollars worth
of improvements there an you neednt

think yu can steal that along with th
range ill fight yu to a finish less i get
paid for it

  tut tut bern chided him i have
stolen nothing im merely collecting in
part for thirty years use of madrigal place
-my rightful inheritance and uncle
henry paid a thousand times over-with
his life-for any improvements youve
made for all that my partner and i are

willing to-

  so barnhill sneered you cash in on
the death o your friend wyman an then
gather yourself another pardner in lessn
two weeks what kind of a man do yu
call yurself that boy- he waxed sen-
timental-still layin in a cold hole in the
ground an you galiivantin round on the
proceeds o his death

  a blue blaze leaped into berns eyes

  it will probably ease your tortured soul
to learn that i saw to the reclaiming of
wymans body the historic night when

goren at your orders-

  where did yu bury him barnhill cut
in breathlessly wont some one be ap
to find the grave

  thats for you to worry about bern
shot at him all i promised to do was
keep quiet about the confession

  a cattle-train snorted past the station
and both men watched it back on to the
switch and move to the railroad stock pens
bern reached for his hat

  come along with me to the pens and ill
tell you something for the good of your
soul he said

  barnhill concurred grumpily he must
learn where wymans grave was located
and make certain that it wouldnt be dis-
covered

  you remember i told you that i needed
twenty thousand dollars to carry out a plan
of thads bern recalled as they clattered
down the hotel stairs well-he wanted
to take madrigal place away from you he
knew about the defective title long before i
came into the country and i couldnt
think of any more fitting way to avenge
him than by making good on his favorite
idea and using your money to do it poetic
justice id call it particularly as it brings
madrigal place back into the family-
where it belongs

  barnhill bristled like an angry dog
he didnt enjoy being ridiculed-particu-
larly by a man who had stripped him of
uncle henry would enjoy this



thousands in money and the cream of his
range the fact that he had laid himself
wide open to the attacks and deserved the
penalty didnt ease the agony

  bern grinned

  it will interest you to know that my
present partner was taking a gang of sur-
veyors out to madrigal place the same day
i sold b w to you i waited for him in
marona till he got back with the description
of the land and we made our purchase before
the land office closed his name didnt
appear on the papers so your attorney put
all the blame on me as a matter of fact
though ive given him an undivided half-
interest in madrigal

  barnhill snorted-

  dickerin with an outsider while you
an wyman were still pardners-or else
you throwed in with this other party before
thad was cold in death

  the caboose of the cattle-train was less
than ten yards up the track and three cow-
boys filed out of the door clambering from
the steps as the brakeman signaled the
engineer the train crunched to a jarring
jangling stop cattle bellowed

  is one o those waddies your pardner
barnhill asked looking at the strangers

  no bern puzzled i thought hed
be the first one out-oh there he comes now
take a slant at the crippled waddie in the
doorway

  barnhill took a slant-and continued
at it stupefied and spineless

  thats my partner-the t part of the
t l brand bern informed him dryly
smart boy fell down a seventy-five-foot
prospect-hole after being hit on the head
with a rock and had the sense to land on the
carcass of a flying y cow only broke his
collar-bone and had a bad headache
from the back platform thad wyman
kissed his fingers coquettishly at barnhill
and paved the way for friendly gossip
next time you write to goren just
mention my name an tell him that i ap-
prove his confession in all respects-even
though he did overrate himself as a thorough
workman i was in the bunk-room rubbin
horse liniment on my head while he an
bern were millin things over in the kitchen
at b w remember it took five gunmen
workin overtime to clean up on henry
madrigal an while i know i aint in his

class still i think you insulted me by sehdin

only one-

  meanin just what demanded hal
currie who headed the gathering crowd
that swarmed near the caboose steps to bid
thad welcome home

  the question stung barnhills somnolent
powers of locomotion into vigorous activity
the defunct b w partner now present
and too much alive was bound by no pledge
of secrecy and the deputys query would he
astutely surmised bring disclosures in no
wise calculated to increase his popularity
he pawed into the throng-there being no
other way to escape-with an eye to the two
hundred yards of clear space separating the
hotel from the stock pens

  meanin thad grinned cheerfully as he
saw balmy summers of the army r m
e outfit blandly step on barnhills instep
thus impeding progress that barnhill
hired goren t kill either bern or me
goren chose me as bein the easiest t
handle an clouted me with a rock while i
was admirin the depths of a shaft in
granite canon-an i come so close to th
pearly gates that i could hear harp music-
or mebbe it was the well known bells o

 yy

  gallopin swordfish tiny slat akers
uttered his favorite war-cry

  git im yelled currie the jails
full o croakees but theres room for a
louse

  barnhill gained the clear and was two
jumps in the lead when thads audience
grasped the full import of what he said

  some one howled tar to which there
was a response a roar of feathers
then a rail and the bedlam of shouts that
characterizes a mob in hot pursuit of its
victim

  bern leaped to the platform beside thad
watched hal currie with an amazing burst
of speed outstrip the crowd and hurl his
portly bulk at barnhill they crashed to
earth above the noise and clamor rose
curries voice shrill with authority and
excitement

  lay off im hes my prisoner an ill
see that he gits all thats cornin to im
and bern answered the swelling tide of
emotion and memory within him by the
simple soliloquy-

  uncle henry would enjoy this
author of the camp robber

v ejinter descended over night
  and laid its cold grasp upon
tanana in the morning when
saarss the drowsy sour doughs rolled
out from their bear-skin robes they saw
the yukon lying silent and rigid invisible
fingers had stilled the push and grind of
passing ice cakes building a winding jagged
causeway a thousand miles to the bering
another nine months of isolation would pass
before the river would tear loose itsre-
straining ice fetters

  from the chill barrens to the north
shrieking winds came scurrying with bur-
dens of driving snow among the black
spruce thickets the narrow trails showed
white crawling tortuously through pass and
over summit men shivered and began to
repair their dog harnesses and snowshoes

  but up the river two miles above the
little string of cabins that comprises tanana
and just below where the tanana river
throws its gritty flood into the yukon the
frost king had been foiled through some
prank of the current which at this point
foams against the upper end of bull island
the ice cakes jostling each other on their
way to the sea had been swirled aside and
when the grinding procession had halted a
large stretch remained open skirting the
island and extending out a considerable dis-
tance from shore it was directly across
the river from the village of that supersti-
tious tribe the tananas

    oksook the old medicine-man peered
  out over the river at the distant dark
  stretch shook his matted head ominously
  and muttered of bad signs

    but the young bucks laughed who be-
  lieved oksook his medicine had lost its
  power the medicine-man of the kan-
  tishnas had cast a spell over oksook he
  had better go off and die

    the old man chewed his toothless gums
  angrily and crept into his dirty little hovel
  how things had changed oksook was not
  an indian his was a parentage of a burly
  russian soldier and an eskimo squaw he
  had spent his fatherless youth and early
  manhood on the desolate salt marshes of the
  yukon delta what a terrible struggle for
  existence it had been searching the bliz-
  zard-swept floes for seal and walrus and
  crouching through the long winters in
  stinking igloos the hardships had forged
  him into a powerful sinewy hunter who
  threw a harpoon with accuracy and force

    then had come the gold-strike up the
  yukon at dawson thousands of white
  men came hurrying north to the island of
  st michael great river-boats were built
  to carry the passengers and freight up-river

     it was on one of these boats that oksook
  got a job as pilot and came to leave the dis-
  mal wastes by the bering there were no
  eyes keener than oksooks to detect snags
  and sand-bars beneath the roily waters
  time brought him far up the yukon to
  
oksook



the tananas disease and whisky had not
yet contaminated this sturdy tribe and
oksook found the lithe slender squaws
much to his liking they were not like the
fat greasy eskimo women on the coast

  with his new manners and air of bravado
picked up from the boisterous boat crews he
soon ingratiated himself into the favor of
the tribe cunning and patience inherited
from his slav father gained him fame and
prestige he came to be known among the
various tribes on the yukon and tanana
rivers as oksook the great medicine-man

  month after month year after year he sat
in his little cabin among his pots and bags
of herbs brewing muttering and sleeping
while the hunters brought him the fattest
salmon and sweetest moose livers in re-
turn for these favors oksook made charms
so that when the countless hordes of caribou
migrated north to their winter feeding-
grounds in the koyokuk they always crossed
the yukon near the village of the tananas
always it was his medicine that filled the
caches with fish therefore as he grew old
and fat oksook smiled and was happy

 but there came a summer when the
salmon changed the course of their run and
avoided the squeaking fish-wheels of the
tananas farther up the river the drying
racks of the kantishna tribe swayed under
their heavy loads of oily fish soon oksooks
tribesmen began to murmur and criticise
day after day he stewed and concocted
strong medicines but the dipping baskets
of the wheels splashed idly and brought up
nothing-a few small whitefish and gray-
ling when fall came the caribou followed
a new ridge north and crossed the river far
above the tananas

  the kantishnas laughed gleefully and
boasted of strong medicine as they traded
their fish and meat to the tananas for fox
and beaver-skins now came also a noisy
little missionary who told them that
oksooks medicine was fraud and oksook
was ruined

  thus it was that the old native became
the joke of the village and an object at
which the boys threw sticks and the squaws
scolded when he begged for bits of meat and
cast-off moccasins each year as he
starved and became more wretched the old
man grew more bitter and morose he had
long since ceased making medicine but
every morning left the village with its vici-
ous urchins and went down the trail to

tanana where he loitered about the saloons
and stores often he met white men who
had known him when he had been famous
and sometimes they gave him money and
whisky

  but this winter promised to be long and
hard and the old medicine-man felt uneasy
when at night he heard the malemiuts
mourn with their pointed noses toward the
green sky

j all day it had been snowing
vtgk heavily and with the darkness had
come a bitter wind that sobbed down
the chimneys and frightened little puffs of
smoke out through the stove cracks the
big round stove in mickeys place glowed
in furious competition with the fiery
whisky that burned the throats of mickeys
customers

  this night the talk had taken a strange
turn

  nugget bill a squaw-man was speaking
to the men who clustered about him in deep
interest

  yep he was saying that bunch o
siwashes up at the village are scared to
death they heered a noise three different
times last night before the storm started
across the river on the island by the air hole
but they cant make out what it was they
said it sounded like a bull moose snortin
about twenty times as loud and jest once
only at a time a couple of young bucks
went over this mornin but she was snowin
so hard that the tracks must been all cov-
ered over they wont any of them go over
any more cause theyve got that old hunch
about spirits and that stuff

  the men all laughed boisterously in-
dian superstition was always a topic of
much debate and ridicule

  why dont they get old oksook on the
job laughed a big trapper they all
used to hand it to him before the salmon
wept back on him

  -by the way interrupted one of them
where is the old boy i havent seen him
today theyre gettin to treat him pretty
bad up there something ought to be done
he wasnt a bad old fellow before his
medicine gave out hes gave many a
fellow a square

  i seed him with the scurvy kid today
replied bill scurvys got a stake he
and oksook used to be pretty good friends
i guess hes gettin him drunk


adventure

  wal the old boy used to pull some pretty
good stuff at that he had em all cornin
his way for a while

 but oksook was not drunk he was
crouching over the battered stove in his
miserable cabin up at the village a
twenty dollar gold-piece given him by
scurvy still fested in his pocket he was
absorbed in gloomy reflections

  today an old indian had come chattering
with fear to tell him of the dreadful noises
that had been heard on bull island the
tale had puzzled oksook but with devilish
cunning he had painted to the superstitious
old buck an evil picture no doubt it was
the great magoona which had come to the
water-hole to drink the native knew the
magoona to be a terrible creature mas-
todons the white men called them

  only a few miles down the river was a
high sandy bluff known by the sour doughs
as the bone-yard from which protruded
scores of gigantic bones often as the
natives hurried by this ill-omened spot in
their canoes they wondered what must
have been the awful ferocity of these pon-
derous brutes a magoona was no animal
to trifle with

  from a mind inflamed with bitter re-
sentment and years of morbid reflection
old oksook portrayed to the shivering in-
dian a frightful vision of gruesome monsters
stalking down from the vast unknown bar-
rens to the north to visit disaster and death
upon villages over which the protecting
influence of a medicine-man was not ex-
tended

  the old buck had slunk from- the cabin
to tell his fellows of this grisly thing hidden
in the dense thickets across the river with
the coming of darkness the frightened vil-
lagers huddled together to spend a sleepless
night

  left alone in the hut oksook had found
it difficult to shake off the mood into which
he had worked himself what could that
noise have been he regretted that he had
not heard it perhaps it really was some
terrible creature wandered down from the
wastes above the arctic rim no man knew
what the inhospitable stretches of this un-
explored region contained if only the
blizzard would raise its concealing curtain
of snow and cease its confusing din

  he thought longingly of the reviving
whisky to be had down at mickeys place
but on opening the door a whirling cloud

of powdery snow enveloped him and he
hastily shut it again it was no weather for
an old man to be on the trail

  not alone the siwashes however were
destined to be frightened by the mysterious
noise this night

  steadily the scream of the winds increased
as they filled the air with hissing snow
down on the unbroken stretch of the yukon
an inferno of flying ice streamed and roared
between the high bluffs little life stirred
abroad even the woolly malemiut curled
his bushy tail over his nose and forgot to
howl

  but there was one man on the trail who
fled before the frosty hurricane and prayed
that he might soon reach shelter he was
pat riley the mail-driver from fairbanks

to tanana he was late the trail had
been soft with drifting snow and both he
and the dogs were fagged it was with
gladness that he sensed the steep sloping of
the trail where it began its plunge down on
to the yukon two miles more and he
would be at the little store which also served
as tananas post-office

  he paused to get his bearings before mak-
ing the dash across the howling confusion
below when he had gone up to fairbanks
just after freeze-up he had seen the open
stretch of water near the trail tonight he
would have to be careful because the ter-
rific wind would tend to crowd the dogs to-
ward the opening

  ice had formed on his eyelashes and he
drew his hands from his warm mittens to
thaw it loose once on the river it would be
a grim struggle till the other bank was
reached
oksook



  mush kitty

  the little malemiut straightened out the
tow-line and led the team down the steep
descent to the river as the dogs and man
emerged from the sheltering willow thicket
that lined the beach the storm caught them
and drove its stinging blasts of sharp
crystals under clothing and into fur shriek-
ing forces tore and buffeted them threaten-
ing every moment to fling them helpless
along the wild course the winds came not
with a steady violence but seemed to crouch
to hesitate and then hurled themselves for-
ward with redoubled fury during these
intervals only could riley see the bushy
tail of his wheel dog twice he stopped the
team went forward and peered into the
whirling blackness ahead but the flying
snow had obliterated the trail and struggling
low against the hurricane to regain the
sleigh he cursed the fates that had left the
river open

  it was kitty who gave warning of the
hole the little leader stopped and whirled
snapping upon the dog behind her a few
feet ahead was an engulfing flood into which
the drifting snow sank and disappeared

  riley staggered forward to where the
black waters gushed out from beneath the
heavy ice

  he stooped and patted the dog

  good girl kitty good girl

  a slight lull had come as if the storm foiled
in its design was contemplating new mis-
chief from across the rushing stream the
moan of the storm in the spruce-trees
swelled up against the wind

  then just before the wind-sirens renewed
their frenzied screaming riley heard a
noise that sent tiny electrical shocks
shooting up his spine into the roots of his
hair he seemed almost to feel it a
ghastly surging sob through the quivering
darkness from the direction of the island

  the man threw up his forearm and shrank
back as if lashed at with a blacksnake he
stumbled among the malemiuts who
snapped viciously from where they cowered
shivering and whining

  riley was irish and had guts but he also
had superstitions in all his years on the
trail he had never before heard a sound like
that it was a sound of furious anguish an
unnatural sound a terrifying sound

 haw-kitty haw i ell yuh he
screamed

  a stinging lash ripped time and time

again into the faces of the groveling dogs
kitty scurried frantically in a half-circle
and the heavy sleigh whirled and swayed
out over the jagged ridges of ice away from
that place away from that sound

  it was near closing time in the saloon and
the boisterous talk had subsided to brief
monosyllables while the men shuffled and
dealt the cards

  only one or two noticed rileys silent
entry and it was not until the mail-driver
had raised a shaking glass to his lips that
one of the players nudged his neighbor and
said in an undertone-

  thought pat didnt hit the hooch any
more

  as the man twisted his head to look the
remainder of the men turned their eyes
toward the bar

  have a tough trip riley one of them
inquired

  yeh replied riley shortly as he
reached once more for the bottle

  the men sensed a change in his manner
but did not inquire further resuming the
game somewhat reluctantly

  soon the mail-driver came over and stood
watching the game silently

  they had paused for a new deal when
riley asked very casually-

  any you fellows been up past the island
lately

  the men glanced at one another queerly
but no one spoke until at last nugget bill
retorted seemingly for the entire group

 no why

  oh-nothing thought i heard a queer
noise as i went by tonight but i guess it
must have been the storm

  there was only the irregular clicking of
fingers playing with poker-chips until bill
again spoke

  my wife was tellin me today that the
indians heered a noise up there las night
but they cant figure out what it was

  it must have been the same thing i
heard returned riley quickly men ive
been in this country twenty years but im
tellin you this was a new one  me even
the dogs laid down on me and wouldnt
budge till id beat half the hide off em she
got my goat for a while

  couldnt been a moose could it pat
inquired one of the men seriously after a
moment of deep silence

  no no im tellin yuh it was dif-
ferent than anything i ever heard before


adventure

it didnt sound right somehow kind of
creepy like but i cant describe it exactly
cause the wind picked up right after it
started

  a few moments of puzzled silence again
absorbed the group no one doubted the
solemn irishman when a teetotaler takes
to drink something had disturbed him
tremendously

  with an ever-watchful eye for oppor-
tunities mickey the bartender called them
up to the bar where the seriousness of the
topic was manifested by a businesslike
clatter of glasses

early morning came and with a
vast consumption of stimulants the
origin of the disturbing noise ever
increased in fantasy and supernaturalism
nothing definite could be decided on it
was finally resolved that when the blizzard
ceased an expedition should go through the
thick brush on the island and endeavor to
learn the cause of this perplexing mystery
thus the matter stood when a last round of
drinks was consumed before the men shuf-
fled off to their cabins

  strange to say one or two wood-choppers
who lived across the river decided to stay
overnight at the little hotel

  shell be too cold to cut wood in the
mornin they explained sheepishly

  but with daylight the storm grew worse
even old french joe who upon any occa-
sion could always remember a past situation
of double the intensity sat silent and awed
by this terrific display of weather forces
excursions to outlying wood-piles assumed
the hardships of polar exploration never
had such a blizzard been seen on the yukon

  however in spite of the mountainous
heaps of shifting snow and blinding flurries
that whipped over exposed portions of the
trail early forenoon saw oksook wallowing
on his ancient snowshoes down to tanana
the burning possession of a twenty dollar
gold-piece and a morbid night of superstiti-
ous wakefulness had driven him out of his
gloomy cabin to seek companionship

  upon his arrival at the little cluster of
half-buried buildings he lost no time in
spending part of his money for a generous
bottle of bootleg whisky neither indians
nor half-breeds could buy liquor over the
bar in tanana but a detour to the back
door always resulted in a flaskful of a mur-
derous concoction prepared only for natives

  the news of the fearful noises coming
from bull island and their terrorizing effect
on the indians in the village had spread
quickly among tananas few inhabitants
thus because of his once having been medi-
cine-man oksook found himself the object
of continual banter and some ridicule

  at first he took it good-naturedly smiling
sagely to himself but as the day wore on
and he drank more and more of his flask
his good humor changed to irritation and
anger which did not decrease the sport but
served rather to aggravate it to mockery
this continued more or less throughout the
day until evening came with its more boister-
ous gathering in the saloons he retorted
to his tormentors with snarls of wounded
vanity until at last unable to withstand any
longer the continuous attack he staggered
from a chair in the barroom where he had
been sitting and shouted frantically to his
revilers

  me show you me show you oksook
he make strong medicine he stop beeg
noise on bull island

  with this he stumbled out into the night
followed by a great hubbub of drunken jeers
and laughter outside the door he swal-
lowed the remainder of his liquor and
crashed the bottle against the heavy logs
of the building

  even in his passion-befuddled mind he
realized that he had made a fool of himself
now because of his insane boast he would
be jeered and laughed at also among the
white men with the fumes of the poison-
ous whisky lashing him to a frenzy of des-
pair and anguish he bowed his head into
the storm and followed a heedless direction
which led him not up the trail to the village
but down on to the wind-scourged surface
of the river

  no one but a drunken eskimo could have
beaten his way up against that freezing
storm he followed no straightway course
but buffeted from side to side by the blasts
slipped and floundered among the troughs of
powdery crystals between the clean-swept
ice-ridges the worn webbing on his old
snow shoes soon parted leaving the useless
frames dangling unheeded about his knees
he did not feel the bitter winds nor suffer
from the stinging particles his mind para-
lyzed from the liquor served but one pur-
pose to impel him forward and forward

  but the tremendous heart action induced
by the stimulant began to fail the old man
oksook



gradually his limbs commenced to shake
and his pounding brain to cool as his
deadened faculties came back to conscious-
ness he became aware of a sinister blackness
close to his right it was the open water
by bull island with the immunity of a
sleep-walker he had been staggering along
its jagged edge

  for a time he stood peering vacantly out
over the murky expanse no recollection
of the terrifying mystery disturbed his
half-conscious study the waters seemed
strangely soft and inviting he felt an
overpowering desire to sink into their
soothing depths out of the biting winds
therb was something hypnotic about the
white flakes that silently sought the dark
surface to sink gently out of view

  lurching forward he stood swaying uncer-
tainly over the very rim as he watched
the river appeared suddenly to rise before
him out of the depths was emerging a
black glistening body from which a pair of
luminous eyes stared malevolently

  before he could draw back a gushing roar
shook the air beating into his ears an old
familiar sound of his youth a sound that
oksook knew and loved

  his shout of joy was drowned in a shower
of freezing water

  ot-si-kee he yelled in eskimo she
blows she blows

  it was the old rallying cry of the whale-
hunt

  then for a moment he stood silent watch-
ing the black body as it skirted the rim
disappearing at length in the darkness in
spite of the intense cold a warm feeling of joy
diffused his benumbed frame once more
he would be oksook the great man a man
to be respected a man to be deferred to
he must capture the great fish this very
night before the secret be discovered by
any one else

  how the whale happened to be so far
from its natural habitat did not perplex
him his years as pilot on the lower river
told him that so preoccupied was he with
his plans that on his way back across the
river he did not feel the biting wind nor
mind the rough going in fact the storm
seemed to be diminishing in violence

  once in his cabin he hastily sought an
old bundle brought with him when he first
came among the tananas from it he drew
a wicked looking harpoon head to which
was attached a long heavy native whale-

line it was still in good condition as he
fitted a shaft into the barbed steel he
hummed a weird old hunting-chant of his
youth the days when he had been the best
harpooner of the tribe several times he
flourished the dangerous weapon at imagi-
nary objects and was surprized to find his
arm still retained its former skill then
arming himself with his rifle and ax he
started back to the opening

  the furious winds had dwindled to a few
spent whispers when oksook again reached
the place where he had seen the whale
overhead above the scudding clouds a flat
moon disk glanced palely through ragged
fringes a dim light was diffused over the
water but the whale was nowhere to be
seen

  without waiting however for it to ap-
pear oksook began to prepare for its cap-
ture about midway between the ex-
tremities of the opening he selected near
the edge a large ice chunk which he hewed
down to the semblance of a stump around
this he wound his line leaving enough free
that he might throw his harpoon a con-
siderable distance this done he laid his
rifle and ax near and awaited his oppor-
tunity long years of hunting on the ice
floes in the bering stood him in good stead
with eskimo patience he waited hour after
hour for the great creature to appear once
it rose with a high spout but it was far over
near the island and as it sank once more
oksook wondered how long it would be
before morning would bring the indians
and white men to share in the capture and
thus deprive him of the sole honor

  the malemiuts in the village had begun
their morning chorus when oksook again
noted the swirl in the water that betrayed
the presence of his prey it was rising near
the rim and on its way up-stream would
pass directly by closer and closer the
glistening back came gliding swiftly and
easily it would be an easy throw if his
arm did not fail him

  his first nervousness was passing off he
drew back his arm tensely leaned forward
and then hurled the harpoon into the black
form as it surged past the instantaneous
whip of the heavy line almost upset him but
he retained a hold on the snub end a
terrific splashing and floundering turned the
whole morning into confusion great waves
of bloody spray came lashing up on to the
ice he did not dare to let the line out


adventure

because he knew he could not pull the broad
hulk up against the swift current

  had thewhale been in the prime of its
strength the line would never have held
but weakened by the lack of food and the
effects of fresh water the beast could not
exert its normal power and therefore soon
tired

  watching his chance oksook secured the
line and held his rifle ready to shoot when
the spray should clear gradually the
mighty lashings grew feebler and feebler
until the waves subsiding he saw the black
hide awash as the loud reports of the
heavy caliber rifle echoed and re-echoed
between the bluffs a fresh commotion shook
the water but this time it was shorter
again the enormous body grew still and
drifted over against the rim of ice to in-
sure his catch oksook took his ax and sank
it deep into the back severing the giant
vertebrae

  a distant shout from the village drew his
attention down on to the white surface
of the river was streaming in a black line
the entire tanana tribe

  oksook oksook what is it he heard
them cry

  the old man cackled grimly he knew
none of them had ever seen a fish larger than

the king salmon which blundered into their
fish-wheels

  look he said calmly can the kan-
tishnas catch fish like oksook

  murmurs of awe and astonishment rose
from squaws and bucks alike when they saw
the ferocious-looking creature that oksook
had conquered they eyed with shudders
the blood where the great tail had lashed the
gory water up on the ice truly oksook
was a mighty man

  go commanded oksook authoritively
and get lines to pull the fish up on the ice
i will prepare medicine for a great potlach
he added and turned his back upon the awe-
stricken natives

  soon came also the white men to look
and wonder many were the speculations
as to how the whale should come to be a
thousand miles up the river but it was
oksook who told his old friend the scurvy
kid

  long time ago he said me pilot beeg
boat on lower river when tide he back up
into river whale he come up to play and
sometimes he get in front of boat many
times we chase him long way but when
boat stop for wood he turn back dis fell
boats he start to burn oil no stop for wood
whale he come all way up

ne by one the officers of the
mechanics school at donovan
field straggled over to the mess
hall some of them in fact
struggled over a few like slim evans
seemed disgustingly bright-eyed and greet-
ed the mom blithely slim who was six
feet four of loosely jointed skin and bones
sang in an enthusiastic bass voice a song re-
garding a merry monarch of the olden times

  the song in a manner of speaking was of
a vulgar nature as slim frequently admit-
ted other men like little a johnson
greeted the flooding sunlight of a new texas
day with eyes yet dull with slumber plus
the effects of a large night

  hashaway lewis chocolate-colored cook
extraordinary kept a wary eye on the
officers quarters whenever one of the
flyers hove into sight around the corner
hashaway took careful aim at a frying-pan
with two eggs and fired without delay

  his assistant the totally black and enter-
tainingly useless taylor hustled grape-
fruit toast and coffee on the table under
hashaways prodding before the prospec-
tive consumer thereof had entered the door
taylors claim to fame rested on the habit
he had acquired of rolling a continuous row
of sevens in the crap games down at the
corral

  nearly all the bachelor officers had pro-
gressed somewhat with their breakfasts
when sleepy spears staggered in arrayed

hastily in a bath-robe that was a veteran
among negligees his square good-na-
tured face needed shaving and his thick
brown hair was in a tall and uncombed con-
dition but his eyes showed bright and
clear beneath the drooping lids

  the sun is shining-its a wonder you
even bothered to get up sleepy remarked
evans attacking his bacon and eggs with
gusto

  spears whose perpetual lack of energy
during daylight hours was proverbial
dropped into a chair and the slow wide
grin that was the spears trademark spread
over his face

  had a hard night last night he said
gently

  ill say you did corroborated a
johnson who didnt look as if his own had
been so peaceful

   spears looked hard at his grapefruit
taylor you ethiopian reptile youve
let half the core in this thing he stated
without heat

  taylor flashed a dumfounding double
row of ivory and carried the grapefruit
back to the kitchen chuckling delightedly
he always chuckled at spears

  what were you doing-studying some
of those correspondence-school courscs
queried jack carruthers who was head of
the motor department

  no replied spears leaning a wearied
head on his elbow




adventure

  in his fits of ambition which overcame
him periodically he had invested in many
pounds of books on subjects covering a very
wide range at least two of the boxes had
never been opened

  i was wooing the fair goddess pursued
spears critically examining the improved
grapefruit that taylor set before him

 which one that blonde i saw-

  no the goddess of chance grinned
spears

  the table digested this for a moment

  over at field two asked slim finally

  spears nodded

  started out as a poker game in bill
blacks quarters the bunch got a little
chunk and pretty soon they were playing
seven-card stud with deuces and fours wild
and that stuff ask al he knows

  johnson who was so small that he seemed
like a manikin grinned ruefully

  either of you do any good inquired
dick cartmell who was charged with the
duty of supervising flying at the mechanics
school

  i got done good al reported

  i quit even spears said eating his
grapefruit listlessly the game got pretty
wild-siddell and that crowd were in it--
and i was eighteen hundred ahead one time
but i lost it

  spe-e-a-ars telephone bawled shot-
ten from the quarters a hundred yards
away

  taylor tell em im not at home
commanded spears

  the grinning darky who possibly recog-
nized in spears the only man in the world
lazier than himself went to the side of the
mess hall which was nothing but screening
when the hinged sides of the small building
were drawn up and put his hands to his
mouth

  he say he aint yeah he bawled trail-
ing off into a chuckle

  aint here- bellowed the disgusted

shotten its long distance

  its long distance loo-o-otinint re-
ported taylor he pronounced the first
syllable with long-drawn-out unction the
others as if out of breath from his previous
exertions

  spears arose languidly and strolled down
the board-walk to the quarters his bath-
robe flapping loosely around his slippered

feet

  he isnt exactly full of pep is he

laughed beale a new student officer who
had just arrived to take the engineer officers
course at the school

  just barely gets around all day but at
night youd be surprized remarked car-
ruthers a handsome curly-haired chap
who had been a new england intercol-
legiate sprint champion the year before he
joined the army

  seems to me that gambling must have
been a little-er-steep said beale

  not for sleepy contradicted evans
or some of those other hombrcs like siddell
theyve got money-spears has guts
hed gather every cent he had in the world
and bet you the sun would shine tomorrow
or it wouldnt what happened al

  the little engineer officer shook his sleek
black head sadly

  the game got wild as -- and i
dropped broke sleepy cleaned em up at
seven-toed pete or any other thing they
mentioned he mustve been all of eight-
een hundred ahead about four this morn-
ing he was the only winner finally
sleepy suggested to siddell that siddell put
up his new marmor roadster against
spears winnings and that they pee wee for
the dice if spears gets em he has to roll
three times and hold the dice that is
throw a natural or make his point all three
times if siddell gets em he only has to
throw once and either make his point or a
natural of course the car is worth double
the eighteen hundred but that gives sid-
dell the edge

  sleepy got the dice and he sure woke
up threw a seven first and then a six
so help me he rolled twenty-three times
without a six or a crap he prayed to em
sang to em pled with em and swore at
em and finally they sevened

   oh - says sleepy played all

night and quit even 

  taylors hee hee hee could be heard
above the laughter of everybody else he
stopped filling evans cup with coffee and
slapped his thigh in delighted glee

  man oh man dats whut ah calls
gamblinl he chortled

  beale whistled

  oh youll get to know sleepy if you
stay here long enough grinned peck an-
other student officer who was just finishing
his course i dont suppose youve heard
about what happened to him out at may
field in california have you
riding herd-modern style



  beale shook his head

  you other fellows have but ill tell it
again anyhow they had a hangar out
there that was so old it was no good it
was empty and the doors were always open
sleepy used to fly a scout ship right through
the darn thing every once in a while one
day the doors at one end were shut and he
didnt notice it he flew in the open end

going like- smashed through the doors

and picked himself out of the worst cracked-
up ship that ever was salvaged how he
got out alive nobody knows

  he looked at the splinters and the hole
in the hangar doors

   i knew theyd do that some day he
says and limps off

  once again the dusky taylor was com-
pelled to cease all operations to give full
vent to his mirth

  he hasnt got enough life to even get a
kick once in a while eh grinned beale

  funny bird-the queerest specimen and
the best fellow you ever met was evans
contribution to the discussion he does
less work than anybody on the post and yet
the airplane department which he runs is
the most efficient section of the school he
looks as though an oyster could beat him in
a hundred-yard dash but ive never yet
seen him fail to match a job or a situation

  sleepys ideal of a job may be deliver-
ing mail to the statue of liberty but i saw
him wake up once stated a johnson his
black eyes sparkling at the recollection

  you mean that kannville affair
asked carruthers leaning back restfully and
lighting a cigaret

  a nodded

  he wasnt the one that made that night
parachute jump and-

  the very man nodded johnson

  beale appeared to have received a body
blow

  we heard about that down on the
border but i never connected up the name

just what was it he had a-of a fight

didnt he

  ill say he did he and i went down
there in two ships to give an exhibition at
the annual fair old sergeant correll who
went along as mechanic got in a scrap with
some of the town bums and that night they
kidnaped him and carried him off to a shack
twenty-five miles away with the intention
of tarring and feathering him

  we heard about it too late to overtake

em in a car so we took off in a ship sleepy
with a parachute on his back when we
got to the place sleepy jumped lit in a field
near the cabin and sneaked up on the
bunch before the tar got good and sticky
i was flying and wasnt supposed to land
but finally i got worried and risked landing
in a strange field at night when i reached
the cabin sleepy had four men just about
licked and had never pulled his gun

  oh can it al came spears voice from
outside and in a moment his stocky form
appeared in front of the screen door

  oh beale wanted to know what a rough-
neck you really are grinned al who was
spears room-mate

  sleepy yawned and poured himself an-
other cup of coffee apparently he had lost
interest in any further remonstrance the
other flyers leaned back for an after-break-
fast cigaret before going to work

  i wonder whether the majord let me
take the lepere cross-country spears
inquired of the table in general

  youre rather late-as usual-planning
a trip ambitious cartmell advised him
this is saturday morning

  sleepy who habitually caught the bus to
san antonio every evening in a half-clad
condition finishing his toilet en route
looked reproachfully at the officer in charge
of flying

  i couldnt prophesy a telephone call
could i

  oh thats it where to

  gonsara theyre having one of those
catch-as-catch-can free-for-all barbecues
down there today gib saunders who was
in the air service during the war just heard

i	was here and called me up to come down
any of you know him

  little red-headed runt asked morris
the adjutant of the school

  uh-huh

  you never had life enough to follow him
around did you

  oh if somebodyll set the pace i can
follow returned spears his already gen-
erous mouth widening slowly into an irre-
sistible grin

  his rather thick-set broad-shouldered
body was a study in complete relaxation

  well ill do what i can to persuade the
major to o k it if you want to take that
ball-the-jack baby morris offered gen-
erously you must plan to give the na-
tives a thrill dont you


adventure

  oh i thought theyd had enough jennys
land down there and besides it takes too
long to get there in a slow ship

  slim evans uncoiled his lathe-like form
and stuck his big stetson on the back of his
head

  they should have had the barbecue here
in the front yard and saved you the trip
he remarked as he strolled toward the door

  the others arose slowly and prepared to
sally forth into the sun already hot and
blinding the roar of motors warming on
the line came to their ears in a deep far-
away drone that was like the humming of
some monstrous bee

now that we are left in peace
taylor ill pee wee for the dice with
you and then shoot you to see
whether you shine my boots before i
dress for nothing or double price said
sleepy

  yes sah grinned taylor

  he put down his coffee-cup and dropped a
half-eaten piece of toast which nutriment
he had been absorbing in the kitchen and
dived for his dice he came up clicking
them like an angry rattler

  spears still resting an elbow on the
table his head cradled in his hand accepted
the dice and threw a five taylor grinning
hugely negotiated an eight

  mah dice loo-o-o-tinint he said spit-
ting on his hands in preparation for the
roll

  spears arose negligently and drew his
faded robe closer about him

  you get double price for the shine
taylor he announced plaintively and
strolled slowly toward the door

  why i aint rolled yit sah said the
puzzled taylor

  you know as well as i do that you could
throw a pair of dice down a flight of steps
and show a seven the boots are over in
my quarters hop to it

  the side-splitting hilarity of the dusky
taylor followed him out of the door he
stuck one hand in his bath-robe pocket as he
strolled toward the quarters and felt some-
thing soft and folded he pulled it out and
spread it it was a ten-dollar bill he had
no idea in the world how it had found its
way into his pocket but it was there and
he was not one to look a gift horse in the
mouth he had a habit of finding money
in every pocket

  he made his way to the bath-house and
shaved leisurely the drone of the air-
planes overhead reverberated inside the
building as the business of donovan field
proceeded without the aid of one lieutenant
john spears

  the feel of the lukewarm water on him
as he stepped under the shower impelled
him to sing as it always did in a totally
tuneless voice he burst forth into a verse of
one of the few songs that he knew

i used to loop and spin with all my m-i-g-h-t

i thought id be a flying star and s-t-u-n-t

oh once i yearned to knock em dead-my good
  ship and m-e

though i was wild thank god this child was
  s-a-v-e-d

  he ceased for a moment to add a little
more cold water to the mixture he al-
ways eased himself into a cold shower by
degrees the insistent tinny drumming of
the phone reached his ears he had an
idea it was probably for him but as the
water grew colder he burst forth discordant-
ly though with enthusiasm into the chorus

oh g-l-o-r-y my friends i was s-a-v-e-d

i never hit the ground too hard in my good s-h-i-p
id rather have white whiskers than die y-o-u-n-g
give other guys the glory-im still a-l-i-v-e

  he turned the warm water completely off
and began to dance briskly under a cold
stinging flood during the brisk rub-down
that followed with a big rough towel
marked with the name of a prominent san
antonio hotel he gave tongue to the song
of the border-patrol flyers who daily cover
the wildest section of the country from the
gulf of mexico to its sister gulf on the
western rim

     ten thousand dollars going to the folks

    ten thousand dollars-

  again he became aware of the telephone
and stopped singing to devote attention
strictly to business once again clad in the
tattered bath-robe he made a leisurely
progress toward the veranda and answered
the insistent ringing

  lieutenant spears talking he an-
nounced leaning restfully against the wall

  sergeant correll lieutenant the major
was just trying to get you on the phone
and i told him youd just stepped out
thanks ill be up in a few minutes
howd you like to fly to gonzara this after-
noon
riding herd-modern style



  suits me fine lieutenant

  well start at noon if we can get a ship
have bitwell write a request for the lepere
will you and say well be back monday
morning purpose of the trip practise
cross-country

  yes sir

  spears hung up and strolled into his
littered quarters the temporary signs of
life he had shown under the shower had
disappeared as he cast aside his bath-
robe the long stringy muscles beneath the
white skin rippled in cat-like smoothness
he lighted a cigaret taking frequent puffs
between the various maneuvers connected
with arraying himself for the morning

  his room was a mass of conglomerate
junk not yet ordered by the skilful hands of
taylor and his high-yellow wife who acted
as chambermaid her husband supervising
in one corner covered by a brown blanket
to make the bulge in the room slightly more
esthetic were two huge boxes unopened
which held complete correspondence courses
on banking and mechanical engineering
respectively the shelf above the table
held two vividly red volumes authored by
boccaccio and rabelais a couple of
technical works on airplanes two represen-
tatives of robert w chambers the medita-
tions of marcus aurelius and a whole set of
o henry

  on the table a pile of magazines had lost
equilibrium and flooded over all available
space a police gazette having reached the
floor the beaver-board walls were cov-
ered with pictures hung without particular
method between two of frederic rem-
ingtons nestled a framed reproduction from
la vie parisienne and some beautiful
cloud pictures photographed from the air
disputed an entire wall with a revealing row
of stage beauties

  spears was finally ready to sally forth
he ambled slowly up the road that ran
along the line of hangars stretching for a
half-mile along the rim of field one from
the bachelor quarters to the row of build-
ings on the northern edge which included
headquarters and the enlisted mens
barracks

  a fifteen-dollar made-to-order shirt that
he wore was slightly wrinkled as a result of
lying in a corner for several hours his
twenty-dollar stetson was tilted over his
eyes dented individualistically according
to a plan that suited sleepy although com-

plying in no detail with the uniform regu-
lations made and provided the black
cravat was loosely knotted and there was a
considerable interval between it and the
shirt collar

  sleepy walked along as if every step would
be his last the wide shoulders sloped as if
burdened with unutterable weariness and
his arms swung loosely at his sides it
took a very close observer to notice that
there was a certain effortless smoothness
about that seemingly tired walk-one move-
ment merged into the next with a panther-
like effect of sinewy rippling strength

  to his left westward stretched the flat
gray two-mile square that was donovan
field field one domicile of the school that
trained air service rookies to be trained
airplane riggers motor mechancis para-
chute experts and what not was a half-mile
long and half as wide the eastern edge a
solid line of hangars

  separated from it by a line of unused
barracks and the rio road field two lay
huge and level merging into mesquite on
its western and southern sides the north-
ern edge was a mile and a half of big white
hangars paralleled by equally trim lines of
barracks machine-shops store-houses and
officers quarters

   above the field the darting little scouts of
the pursuit group dodged in and out among
the lazily floating billows of snowy mist
that were growing ever larger as the heat
increased a thundering formation of
liberty-motored de havilands from the
bombardment group roared its majestic
way above the field its unvarying regu-
larity testifying to the flying ability of the
pilots handling a ton-and-a-half ship and
keeping it twenty-five feet no more and no
less from the ship ahead and in precise
position in three dimensions is no task for an
amateur

  spears slowly passed the flying-depart-
ment hangars a dozen ships of different
types were lined up on the edge of the field
ranging from the tiny sopwith camel up to
a big twin-motored bomber the me-
chanics dressed uniformly in coveralls
were busily wiping down the ships in prep-
aration for the half-holiday dick cart-
mell waved and jeered as sleepy made his
leisurely way past the bench and beale
who was in helmet and goggles for a flight
grinned at him cheerfully

  the next group of hangars housed the


adventure

airplane department where riggers were
manufactured from raw youngsters who
sought to learn the technique of a still new
profession sleepy straightened his hat as
he entered the first big structure and looked
around him keenly as he walked the length
of it all around were groups of students
each under an instructor who were doing
everything from doping linen to putting the
final touches on a big de haviland which
that particular class had assembled and
rigged

  sleepy grinned in reminiscent compla-
cency at the memory of the hard days of
toil he had put in shaping the department
so that it was self-running the task of
stealing hard-boiled old sergeant correll
from the engineering department to act as
personal representative disciplinary non-
com and general energizer had been ex-
hausting in itself

  the sergeants huge portly figure was
ensconced comfortably in its wonted chair
in the office as spears entered

  heres that request for cross-country
lieutenant he said and shoved the type-
written missive over to spears uncluttered
desk

  spears signed it without reading it two
typewriters clicked busily under the flying
fingers of uniformed young men who were
ever mindful of the near presence of correll

  all the reports out queried spears
without particular interest

  signed and gone i put my initials
under your name inasmuch as you werent
here returned correll

  good say better take this request up
to headquarters yourself give it to lieu-
tenant morris and when its approved go
down to the flying department with it and
see that the le pere is ready to go at twelve
will you

  the sergeant snapped his finger

  get my hat out there on the rack he
commanded the orderly and stick by the
phone this morning while im gone i may
need you

  sleepy relaxed in his swivel chair one foot
on the desk his eyes followed the ser-
geant through the window as he strode up
the road toward headquarters ever since
that night when he had made a night para-
chute jump and with al johnsons help at
the end prevented a tar-and-feather party
at the sergeants expense correll had been
his right-hand man for any and all purposes

the fight had been very bothersome and
had spoiled his evening in kannville with a
certain creamy blonde reflected sleepy but
on the whole it was well worth it

  he lit a cigaret and pushed his weirdly
dented hat back on his head he leaned
forward and grasped the telephone leaning
back again as far as the chair would go
he must call up major stratton and tell
him he had just stepped back in again and
then hed catch up on a little slumber be-
fore the trip to gonzara

n	

the wicked-looking low-hung le
pere was the only ship left on the
line at noon with sturdy wheel-
blocks under the wheels a mechanic on
each wing and another on the tail correll
was warming up the big twelve-cylinder
liberty motor

  sleepy waited until the soft hum of idling
grew into the drumming roar which an-
nounced that it was running wide open on
the final warm-up and then left his quarters
to walk the few hundred yards to the line
correll had already been down after his
suit-case and he noted that the bag was
wired on the wing close to the fuselage
everything was in readiness

  correll slowly eased the throttle back
until the propeller was turning slowly be-
fore he climbed out of the front cockpit
sleepy adjusted his goggles-he wore no
helmet-and stuffed cotton in his ears it
was not necessary to ask whether the motor
was o k-corrells silent transfer of seats
told the story

  the pilot surveyed the crowded instru-
ment-board casually as he adjusted the
buckle of the wide canvas belt oil pres-
sure thirty air pressure three tempera-
ture  centigrade and voltmeter charg-
ing-all was as it should be he nodded to
the mechanics and they jerked away the
wheel-blocks

  all ready sergeant he yelled

  correll waved assent and sleepy taxied
up the field the trip was a hundred and
forty miles he figured they would get
there in an hour which would be one oclock
and just the time that gib saunders would
be expecting them

  he turned around and slowly fed the
throttle the le pere gathered speed
rapidly and in a sdcond was speeding across
riding herd-

the ground like a bullet slow pressure on
the stick brought the tail up and almost
before he knew it they were in the air he
held the ship close to the ground for a
minute and then lifted it upward in a beau-
tiful m that brought them to three
hundred feet the air was very bumpy
and even the heavy solid le pere was
bounced around in the air currents as it
circled the field three times getting altitude

  at two thousand feet spears flew over
san antonio carefully picking out the
railroads leading eastward he verified
the one leading to gonzara by means of a
small stream which his map showed running
parallel to it five miles farther on a fork
in the tracks the southern branch leading to
the gulf of mexico was additional veri-
fication that he was right so he settled back
comfortably in his seat

  usually flying was merely mechanical
with him there was no particular pleas-
ure in it-just sitting there until he got
where he wanted to go today however
here was a certain satisfaction in it that
vas unusual the swift rush of the air past
him was cool and comfortable in contrast
to the baking land below and as the le
pere hurled itself through the misty lower
edges of cloud after cloud the feel of the cool
moisture was the acme of physical delight

  the le pere was the pride of the school-
one of the only two of the type on donovan
field it was immeasurably faster than
any other ship on the field-it could fly
circles around a d h and left fokkers
s e s and even the powerful little 
spad hopelessly out of the running

  like a majority of the american flyers
it was a distinct event for sleepy to get his
hands on a real ship he had not flown
anything but frail clumsy de havilands or
rebuilt british and german scout planes for
so long that flying renewed its joy for him
as he surveyed the trim strong wings
without dihedral or overhang and the solid
laminated fuselage so different from what
he had been accustomed to since leaving
france

  obeying a sudden impulse born of his
whole-souled flyers delight in flying an
honest-to-goodness ship for once he throttled
the motor and nosed down the strongly
built ship would stand it almost as well as a
spad so he allowed the air-speed meter to
go up to a hundred and eighty miles an
hour the while he carefully handled the

modern style	

throttle until despite their terrific speed
the  horse-power liberty was only turn-
ing fifteen hundred revolutions

  like a meteor the big black-and-white
ship shot toward the sundrenched earth
two thousand feet below it was a smiling
country of alternate flat cotton-fields and
small patches of mesquite splotched with
shadow as the snowy cumulus clouds drifted
across the sun

  correll in the black cockpit leaned over
anxiously and treated the instrument-
board which he could see from his seat to a
careful inspection there was nothing
wrong there and the motor was certainly
firing evenly and without missing so the
portly mechanic leaned back again and
devoted all his attention to blowing out his
ears to keep the change in pressure from
deafening him every few seconds he
grasped his nose firmly kept his mouth
closed and blew hard spears following his
example as they sped ever nearer the
ground

  they were diving parallel with the rail-
road and at two hundred feet sleepy grad-
ually came out of the dive easing the
throttle on slowly as he came level at
fifty feet directly over the railroad the
ship was flying in normal position the motor
turning 

  spears leaned forward and opened the
shutters which he had closed for the dive
to keep the motor from cooling too fast
then he settled down to fly the railroad-
every curve of it

  at a hundred and forty miles an hour a
few feet above the wires the le pere roared
its way down the railroad the sensation
of speed almost indiscernible a thousand
feet or more high was now paramount

  the little town of carston heard the ever
increasing roar of the motor and stirred
from its midday lethargy to sweep the sky
with languid interest it grew into as-
tonished wonder as a black-and-white
meteor shot across the housetops the tiny
railroad station and on down the railroad so
swiftly here she comes followed by
there she goes were about the only com-
ments a reasonably intelligent and quick-
witted person could encompass before the
le pere was gone

  sleepy his attitude still relaxed as he
guided the mighty machine beneath him
was smiling slightly and the lazy gray eyes
were glowing softly it was the kind of


adventure

flying that has killed many a pilot for
chances of a crack-up in case of motor failure
were very promising however it was the
expression of a spirit without which there
would never have been a conquest of the
air scientists may experiment but some
one must take a chance

  ten minutes of flashing progress along
the shining steel rails left the motor at o
centigrade-not too hot a stretch of big
level cotton-flelds on his right tempted
sleepy to bank away from the railroad
he dropped down to five and skimmed the
tops of the cotton plants

  when he reached a fence a tiny zoom took
him over it a cluster of houses loomed
ahead and with a world of excess speed he
lifted the le pere in a smooth curving zoom
that cleared the houses by a hundred feet
he dropped down again for a wild rush
across a straight half-mile of waving corn

a big level stretch of closely
cropped grass showed ahead
thirty or more horses and mules
were grazing in it sleepy obeyed a sudden
impulse and dived along the eastern edge of
the field close to the fence a dozen of the
animals who were occupying that section
kicked up their heels and departed hastily
zooming up at the other end of the field
sleepy noted that one mule had not re-
treated far enough so he shot down and
herded the recalcitrant beast into the main
bunch along the western boundary

  this accomplished he circled back of the
field a few hundred yards slowly cut the
throttle and stalled over the fence landing
smoothly on three points with a few
quick thrusts of gas he turned around
taxied back to the fence and pointed the
nose down the field in preparation for the
take-off

  whats the trouble lieutenant in-
quired correll anxiously

  just wanted a smoke returned his
chief stretching mightily as he reached the
ground

  the sergeant took a full minute to digest
this information he grinned as he looked
at spears now puffing contentedly as he
lay on the ground

  must be-er-feeling pretty good to-
day lieutenant he ventured

  oh not so bad not so good replied
spears airily light up-we havent got
much time

  the ship was idling softly the airmen
lay restfully on the ground undergoing the
severe inspection of the horses and mules
who had retired to the farthermost limits
of the big field

  spears moved a trifle to get in the breeze
generated by the propeller and then moved
back again with a grunt of disgust as he
noted that he would lose his cigaret if he
remained there he lay motionless his
arm over his eyes to keep out the blinding
radiance of the noon-high sun

  when he had inhaled the last possible
supply of smoke from his diminutive cigaret-
stub he sat up yawned and put on his
goggles correll threw away his smoke
and climbed in the rear in a moment
they were roaring across the field taking the
air before its length was half-covered

  they flew straight down the railroad
climbing gradually until once again they
felt the cool air under the clouds against
their faces spears shook the stick and
correll leaned forward spears cut the
motor for a moment as he yelled-

  you fly it

  correll nodded with much satisfaction
he could keep a ship level in the air all
right and took great delight in an oppor-
tunity to demonstrate his ability spears
passed his map back to the mechanic and
with his finger indicated their precise posi-
tion correll nodded his comprehension

  spears settled deeply into his seat so far
behind the wind-shield that he scarcely felt
any of the terrific air pressure compounded
of their speed and the propellers blast
the motor was running well within its pos-
sibilities at fifteen hundred revolutions
his arms rested limply on the cowling and
his eyes gazed calmly on the clouds drifting
just above them the roar of the motor
with its hypnotic monotony lulled him into
drowsiness and in a moment sleep

  for a wonder he awakened just before
they arrived alt gonzara sergeant correll
was just deciding that it was time to lean
over and shake the pilot when spears stirred
and looked around as they came over the
fairly large town he saw a railroad crossing
and recognized gonzara his wrist-watch
showed 

  he was familiar with the landing-field
and quickly picked it up the wide-
spreading grove next to it-the location for
the barbecue-was swarming with tiny ant-
like specks and the smoke of the barbecue
riding herd-modern style



fires rising almost straight in the air
provided a good wind-vane evidently
there was practically no wind on the ground
such as there was being from the south
the field itself ran north and south which
made it as convenient as could be wished
for landing

  correll had climbed to five thousand feet
on the way spears took the stick and
pulled it back as far as it would go applying
left rudder at the same time the nose
came up until the ship was almost per-
pendicular in the air and then fell off to the
left in a whirling dive spears cut the
motor half-way-he did not throttle fully
because that would foul the spark-plugs
and it was very possible that he would need
a good motor before making his landing

  the heavy le pere with a thousand-
pound motor in its nose running half-open
screwed downward in a terrific vertical tail-
spin four hundred feet a turn and the
turns came so fast it was almost impossible
to count them

  sleepy watched the ground calmly oc-
casionally blowing out his ears for com-
forts sake he kept an eye on the alti-
meter which was wabbling crazily in an
effort to keep up with the rushing loss of
altitude

  every wire was screaming with the speed
and correll experienced passenger though
he was was dizzy and sick as the big
flashily painted ship corkscrewed through
the last thousand feet sleepy grinned
slowly as he caught kaleidoscopic views of
the crowd below now motionless

  some of em are getting the roofs of
their mouths sunburnt- he reflected as he
jammed on right rudder and pushed the
stick forward

  a turn more and the le pere straight-
ened out in a vertical dive it took four
hundred feet before the nose started coming
up as sleepy eased the stick back slowly
it was not so easy to do against the force of
the wind on the elevators

  three hundred feet above the ground the
ship was level and the motor came full on
as spears circled the long narrow landing-
field eying it closely for possible ditches or
crack-brained onlookers who might be in
the way satisfied that gib saunders or
some one equally wise was warning the
crowd to keep away he made a wide circle
and approached the field in a slow dive from

the north

   

  slow in a le pere means around ninety
miles an hour the throttle crawled back
by degrees until it was idling as the ship
sped over the trees and dropped down until
it was two feet above the ground know-
ing the gliding propensities of his ship
sleepy kicked the rudder and sent the plane
into a skid that helped kill their speed
they were less than fifty yards from the end
of the field when they stopped rolling

  as he taxied toward the western edge of
the field which was packed with people
who had temporarily deserted the barbecue
the pilot spied a dancing figure in the fore-
ground that he recognized readily even
at that distance there was no mistaking
the red hair and somewhat portly form of
ex-lieutenant gib saunders

  sleepy taxied toward saunders stopping
a few feet in front of the crowd that poured
out behind the one-time pilot

  burn out the motor will you correll
requested spears

  correll climbed into the front seat and
turned off one of the gas pet-cocks as sleepy
tumbled off the wing into the flailing arms
of saunders

  not so vigorous gib not so vigorous
spears cautioned with his widest grin as his
freckle-faced bright-eyed comrade of over-
seas days seemed bent on knocking the life
out of him with tremendous thumps on the
back these folks dont know whether
this is a fight or merely an exhibition you
red-headed firebrand

  nor is it any of their business re-
turned saunders i could see by the way
you got out o that ship-which is a beauty
by the way-that you havent got any more
life in you than you used to have

  not in texas anyhow of all the

stewing fly-bitten deserted-

  dont say another word i hate to
beat up a guest warned gib whose
monologs anent his beloved state were well
remembered by spears

  saunders led him through the curious
ever-growing crowd that had already sur-
rounded the ship

  sure that big mechanic can tend to
everything queried the irishman as they
threaded their way through

  anything he cant tend to would be far
beyond me grinned sleepy

  in that case well hop into the car here
and get dad he had to be at the bank this
morning marys around here somewhere


adventure

 but you can meet her later what about
 your suit-case

   oh we can bring that in later i refuse
 to wear a blouse until evening

   good ive got a guard for your ship
 so your mechanic will be free hop in and
 well jazz down-town and right back

   the big touring-car left a cloud qf dust as
 saunders sped townward his tongue going

	nearly as fast as his car while he tried to
 cover two years in ten minutes

ill

 at  pm mr daniel saun-
 ders genial cashier of the gonzara
 bank let himself into his house to
 prepare for a descent on the festivities of the
 afternoon the house was deserted every
 other member of the family having left for
 the fair-grounds long before

   mr saunders had barely applied himself
 to the lunch left for him on the kitchen
 table when the door bell rang

   come in roared the banker

   gonzara was a small and easy-going
 town every inhabitant of which was per-
 sonally known to him

   a tall well-dressed stranger let himself
 in and walked down the hall which led to
 the kitchen the open door of the kitchen
 allowed mr saunders to observe the prog-
 ress of his guest and he arose with an
 apology

   i thought it must be some of the neigh-
 bors he said with an unembarrassed smile

   the smile faded as he looked into the
 business end of a colt 

   listen and listen close said the stran-
 ger whose face was minus the tan of the
 native texan youre going with me to
 the bank ill have you covered every
 minute from my pocket when we get there
 youll open the vault get your coat on
 his words were staccato and strictly
 business-like and the impression he made
 was undramatic however there was a
 certain strength of purpose and cold re-
 solve apparent that caused the amazed
 cashier to put on his coat without a word
 temporarily he was incapable of connected
 thinking

   the tall stranger who looked to be about
 thirty-five followed saunders out of the
 door a big black touring-car holding two
 men besides the driver was drawn vup in
 front of the house the men were all

smoking and their attitudes were easy and
untroubled the chauffeur started the
motor as they appeared at the door

  if we meet anybody that speaks to you
answer them naturally do you under-
stand said the stranger in conversational
tones as they walked down to the car

  his right hand was in his coat pocket

  mr saunders nodded mechanically a
quick look up and down the quiet shaded
street showed only three or four people
all of them some distance away

  he and his captor took seats in the ton-
neau the man who shared it with them
was stout and cold eyed and was smoking
a big cigar all of them were inconspicu-
ously dressed and all had a young-old look
their faces showing deep lines around the
mouth and hard eyes

  as the car drove toward the bank at
moderate speed mr saunders was ever
conscious of the pressure of a gun at his side

  act natural and keep your eyes open
for anybody you ought to speak to ordered
the tall man once more as they approached
the town square

  any trouble srfaring him joe inquired
the man who shared the front seat with the
driver

  not a bit caught him with his mouth
full

  mr saunders had had a wild hope that
perhaps on the lrive through the square it
might be possible to arouse some ones sus-
picions but the robbers took a roundabout
route that brought them up to the bank
without going through the main part of
town the bank was located only a few
steps from the square on a side street lead-
ing from it

  the car drew up in front of the small
brick structure and the chauffeur calmly
stopped the motor the thing was satan-
ically audacious and yet well planned
reflected the unhappy cashier despairingly
ninety per cent of gonzaras population
were out at the fair-grounds for the big
annual jubilee commemorating the found-
ing of the town and there were so many
visitors from other towns that strangers
aroused no comment

  hop out and dont waste a minute
if wp meet anybody im mr smith an old
friend of yours this other fellow is a
friend of mine and dont kid yourself
that well hesitate to pump you full of holes
if you squeal
riding herd-modern style



  the stout man accompanied his accom-
plice and the cashier into the bank mr
saunders unlocked the front door in a daze
and let them in

  pull up the window and door curtains
commanded the tall man whom the others
addressed as joe

  his stout comrade in crime took up his
station by the door leaning easily against
the wall and peering through a crack in the
curtain the men in the car smoked calm-
ly although their hard eyes unobtrusively
watched the infrequent stragglers that
passed across the street a few steps ahead
where it led into the square

  open that vault quick we know the
lay of the land so dont stall said joe
briskly his gun out of his pocket once
more

x the gonzara bank was small and it had
not reached the point yet where compli-
cated time-locks and other safety features
had been incorporated into its equipment
with a heavy heart the cashier silently set
to work he watched helplessly while
more than twenty thousand dollars went
into the traveling-bag that the stout man
carried

  it was doubly unfortunate that the bank
should have an unusual amount of cash on
hand it was ginning-season and the gon-
zara cotton-growers had deposited a lot of
money during the last few days

  close everything up and then let down
the curtains said the tall man as the other
thief strolled nonchalantly down the steps
and into the car

  mr calvin burton a gentleman of color
who was accustomed to do odd jobs for mr
saunders passed by the bank as the cashier
was letting down the shades to their accus-
tomed position when the bank was closed
passers-by had free view of the interior when
it was closed but the big shades were
raised to keep out the sun when the bank
was open mr burton was on his way to
the barbecue and yelled a cheerful after-
noon sah as he passed

  answer came in a deadly whisper from
joe who was playing a light conversational
part for the benefit of passers-by

  one would have thought that he and the
cashier were close friends indulging in
cheerful small-talk

  mr saunders forced a wave and a smile
apparently calvin did not think it peculiar
that the cashier should be at the bank so

  late for he passed on whistling cheerily
vouchsafing the car and its occupants a
glance of only perfunctory interest

  now youre going to take a little ride
with us stated joe as his captive silently
locked the door

  he could scarcely grasp the situation
even then-it seemed like a dream some-
how that he should be forced to help rob
the bank he simply could not compre-
hend it at joes last words he came to
life with a snap

  where to

  just out in the country a little ways
where youll be safely out of the way till
monday

  i might just as well let you shoot me as
be suspected of conniving at this outrage
blazed mr saunders

  they had stopped at the door of the car

  climb in you - fool snarled the

chauffeur a thin-faced man wearing a linen
duster

  we can club you over the head and make
you go snapped joe if itll comfort
you any youll be tied up tight with
plenty of food and water to last till youre
found

  mr saunders took a last despairing look
up toward the square the irony of it en-
tered his soul as he saw george hardwick
who owned a drug-store drive his car past
the street on his way to the barbecue

  even if the bluff hardwick had turned
around however he could have done noth-
ing but wave for joes gun could be felt
through the pocket as the tall impressively
cool crook pressed close to him he silently
climbed into the car which turned around
in a leisurely way and rolled off down the
street well within the speed laws

iv

thats funny the house is un-
locked but where is dad

  saunders had shouted for his
father without result spears dropped into
a chair

  maybe he caught a ride out to the cele-
bration he suggested

  he wouldnt have left the house un-
locked objected gib maybe he forgot
it though well wait around a while and
see whether he went over to some of the
neighbors for something his lunch was
only half-eaten




adventure

  the two friends sat and smoked while
gib tried to draw out spears as to what had
happened to him during the last two years
sleepy had been assigned to the border
patrol for a while around calexico and
yuma working mainly out of san diego
saunders eyes glistened as he listened to
the very few things that spears could be
prevailed on to tell about the doings of the
air service

  i sure wish i was back sometimes he
said wistfully his good-humored face re-
gretful but it looked like too good a
chance to miss here at the mill of course

im making money but-

  ambition is the curse of young men
stated sleepy why grub until youre
fifty for a hundred thousand that youve
forgotten how to enjoy

gib grinned and glanced at his watch
good lord its two oclock i guess
dad must have gone to the barbecue with
somebody and forgotten to lock the door
lets go

   out at the grove inquiries failed to locate
mr saunders the puzzled gib finally
spotted mr calvin burton arrayed like the
lilies of the field and escorting a dusky
belle with much eclat

  oh cal you havent seen dad around
here have you

  nossah i seed him down to the bank
bout a hour ago

  at the bank for the love of-

  yessah they was a man in there with
im and a car was sittin out front yessah
jack thats kind of funny stated saun-
ders lets hunt up mr sears maybe
he can tell us- by gorry when we asked
him whether hed seen dad he didnt say
anything about his being at the bank late
for any special reason did he

  no he didnt agreed sleepy

  they rushed around through the milling
crowd until they espied the tall thin
weather-bitten old-timer who looked less
like a bank president than a cowboy as
a matter of fact in his younger days he had
been a rider not so many miles from gon-
zara either

  mr sears do you know why dad was
at the bank so late today cal said he saw
him there about one oclock he was to
wait for me at the house but i cant find
him anywhere

  why no son i dont drawled the
banker who was taking it easv under the

  trees in the company of some cronies
what did he appear to be doin

  i dont know cal said there was a
man in the bank with him and a couple
more out in front in a car

  a small bright-eyed man whose store-
clothes did not quite hide his bowed legs
had been listening casually at gibs last
words he looked up quickly

  who were the men did cal say

  he didnt know em returned gib an
uneasy premonition of wrong sweeping
over him

  any bank-robberies being pulled around
here inquired sleepy suddenly

  the quiet question acted like an electric
shock on the little gathering

  gib get that cal nigger and bring him
here pronto ordered the bright-eyed little
man who was county sheriff

  young saunders departed rapidly on his
hunt

  tom you dont mean to tell me you
think the bank has been-

  sears you know what happened over to
caryville last week dont you it pays to
be sure

  the tanned somewhat stooped banker
wiped his face with a huge handkerchief

  im goin to see right now he declared
rising to his feet

  lets wait a couple o minutes for cal
ill go with you then the nigger may be
able to tell us some more

  in a moment cal appeared in saunders
company he was unable to add any more
to the story he had not noticed the men
especially but was sure he did not know any
of them his description of the car was
vague all he knew was that it was fairly
big and that there were two men in it and
another one very tall in the bank with the
cashier

  the sheriff and mr sears set off in the
bankers car to investigate the rumor
had spread and a continuous stream of
men approached gib and spears asking
eagerly for information in a few minutes
a considerable crowd of gonzara citizens
were standing around with saunders wait-
ing for the return of the sheriff and sears

  they did not have long to wait in
fifteen minutes the big car came booming
down the road at a speed so far in excess of
mr sears customary conservative driving
that gibs heart sank

  every nickel of cash gone from the
riding herd-modern style	

vault yelled the sheriff as the car skidded

to a halt every-one o you fellows

are sworn in right now

  the little man raised his hand for silence
as a storm of questions assailed him

  ive got to send off a bunch o wires right
away i want every available car to get
filled up and start out all the roads after

em if-

  maybe some one here saw which way
the car went suggested sears who was
pulling nervously at his scraggly mustache

  anybody here just arrive if so did
they notice a black five-passenger car leav-
in town with four-or mebbe five if they

kidnaped saunders-

  the fiery little sheriff stopped for a mo-
ment and then smote his opened hand with
his fist

  by the mighty thats what they done
they carried off saunders to prevent an
alarm see it they get three or four
hours start anyway before saunders is
missed mebbe more then its longer yet
mebbe till monday before the robbery is
known just the accident o gib here goin

home after the old man-

  i believe youre right declared sears
excitedly and a buzz arose from the packed
crowd that surrounded the group of men

  anybody here see a car leavin town
demanded sheriff metcalfe

  a big raw-boned sombreroed fellow
spoke up from the rear

  i passed one full o men on the san an-
tone road he drawled didnt notice
em special though

  probably them declared metcalfe
whose puckered gray eyes were flashing
fire

  gib saunders face was very serious as he
listened the thought of his father in the
hands of the thieves and what might hap-
pen to him had suddenly changed the merry
young gib into a flaming-eyed thin-lipped
texan who would be a distinct factor in
anything that might come up sleepy
looked at him sympathetically and then his
gaze returned to the sheriff who was talking
rapidly

  theres just three roads theyd be liable
to take specially figurin on havin a lot o
time for the getaway that san antone
road is one of em that splits thirty miles
up at torbard-no tellin which one theyd

take -

  how far apart do the roads run i mean

when that road splits do the two forks run
within twenty miles or so of each other for
a while

  it was sleepys voice with a subtle change
in the timbre of it that caught gibs atten-
tion the crowd looked curiously at the
aviator

  why yes they dont get furthern
twenty miles apart for a good piece not till
the south road bends due south to corpus
but-

  heres what i was thinking proceeded
sleepy calmly i can take my plane up
and overtake that car in an hour at the most
covering both roads if somebody has
some field-glasses i can do it in less because
by flying between them we can nearly see
both roads at once when i spot which
road theyre -i can make pretty certain
by diving low and looking them over-i can
fly back to the automobiles with the posse
and signal them which road theyre on
then i can fly back over them and go on
to the next town if theres a field i can
land in i can maybe get a bunch of men out
to stop em anyway-

 by-

  the little sheriff slapped his leg in exul-
tation an excited murmur came from the
crowd which now included hundreds of
people as the possibilities of the scheme
were realized

  and ill go along with a rifle in the back
seat-im used to flying gib cut in his
eyes flashing with eager hope

  the sheriff set to work immediately in
less time than it takes to tell it cars were
dispatched to town after high-test gas for
the plane field-glasses from mr sears
house and a supply of rifles and revolvers
from divers homes the roar of the air-
plane motor which correll was warming up
before the advent of the gas to save time
was a constant and exciting reminder to the
crowd of what was to come

  the only calm human being at the bar-
becue was lieutenant john spears who
was in semi-hiding behind an isolated tree
in gibs company to avoid being bothered
with questions the pair did not appear
publicly so to speak until the cars had re-
turned from town with the needed supplies
as they left their quiet retreat and ap-
proached the surging mob around the ship
now silent as correl quickly filled it with
gas sleepy looked at his red-headed friend
with a slow grin


adventure

  im sure your dad is all right gib-just
in hiding so to speak or on the way to be
hid for a couple o days so lets enjoy
ourselves eh

  somehow his quiet confidence was in-
fectious

  youve said it declared gib

v

three thousand feet high the big
le pere boomed along the san an-
tonio road it was three-thirty
and according to cals story the robbers
had almost three hours start probably
about ninety miles reflected spears unless
something had happened saunders knew
every foot of the country and had said that
there were no side roads that the thieves
would be likely to take

  they came to the fork in the road and
sleepy guided the plane squarely down the
middle line between the two for fifteen
miles ahead the roads were not more than
ten miles apart the gap between them grad-
ually widening

  they had sighted only two cars driving
along the way they were traveling both
very small ones they had played safe
and dropped earthward for a close look
the country was not thickly settled and
such traffic as there was which was small
was toward gonzara and not away from it

  saunders was watching the right-hand
road and spears the left they had trav-
ersed about fifteen miles on a line between
the two when gib reached over and shook
the pilot he pointed down to a tiny speck
traveling along the road toward san
antonio

  sleepy nodded and nosed down he
did not believe it was their car he figured
that to be several miles ahead what he
did not figure on was the stop the desper-
adoes had made on a side road to chain mr
saunders securely in a deserted shack
where they had left him with sufficient food
and water to last three days

  they were a thousand feet high when they
caught the car and as he circled over it
sleepy noted that it was large and black
and traveling fast the country under-
neath was mostly mesquite although iso-
lated cleared spots could be seen

  the le pere under his handling was
skimming the tops of the trees several hun-
dred yards back of the car sleepy flew

parallel to the road as low as possible and
throttled the motor slightly as they shot
past there were several men in the car
that was certain

  gib a long-barreled rifle in his hand
leaned over the rear cockpit as far as he
could stretch trying his utmost to identify
some one in the car they flashed by so
fast however that they could come to no
conclusion

  spears turned the throttle full on and
circled back once more he could scarcely
believe that was the car and yet it might
be certainly the passengers had craned
their necks to the utmost to watch them
but that would be only natural for anybody
to do in view of the low flying he was doing

  on the next trip past the car the thieves
gave themselves away probably it was
the sight of gibs rifle and the fact that the
circling of the plane denoted suspicion as
the two flyers shot by their heads turned
as they strained their eyes toward the car
they saw two revolvers spit flame at them

  gibs face was alight with exultation
and his eyes flashed fire through the big
goggles the shots did not bother them
particularly-a fast moving plane is about
as difficult a target as there is extant

  sleepy pointed backward and gib nod-
ded the map showed that the road
was without cross-cuts for twenty miles-
by the time the car covered that they could
be back again after signaling the posse
coming behind

  with motor turning eighteen hundred
and speedmeter showing a hundred and
forty miles an hour the le pere sped back
over the trail it took less than fifteen
minutes to reach the three speeding auto-
mobiles that held the sheriff and his
deputies the le pere turned around
flew straight for a moment and then banked
steeply to the right it was the agreed-
upon signal to indicate which road the
bandits had taken

  the flyers wasted no time but went swift-
ly back on their way they found the car
speeding along the road plainly making
every effort to get where they were going as
fast as might be practicable the le pere
passed it five hundred feet high and flew
on ahead the next town was fifteen miles
up the road and was only a hamlet

  they were perhaps five miles ahead of the
car when they struck a very large cleared
spot extending at least three hundred
riding herd-

yards on each side of the road it was
a corn-stubble field mowed closely and
what looked to be a partially broken-down
shack was in one corner

  gib shook sleepy energetically and
pointed down he motioned to it with his
rifle sleepy nodded his eyes glowing
beneath the drooping lids and his face all
a-grin at what he conceived to be gibs idea
he dipped over the field ascertaining that
the furrows were shallow and that the
stubble was very short and then circled
back a few hundred yards for his landing

  there was plenty of room but he stalled
down across the mesquite and landed leav-
ing space enough for a take-off from where
the plane stopped gib had unfastened his
belt before the plane stopped and was out
in a flash

  i can get up there behind a tree or some-
thing and pop their front tires he said
quickly his freckled face ablaze with ex-
citement

  can you shoot that well enquired
sleepy doubtfully

  born and brought up in texas boy
stated saunders you take off and keep
in touch with the posse i could get every
one of them from behind my tree if they
started to rush me when i put their car out
of commission if you stay here the plane
will warn them before they get near enough
for me they could scatter in the mes-
quite then and make the deal a lot more
difficult

  sleepy nodded his acquiescence and
shoved on the throttle without delay
there was plenty of room and he cleared
the mesquite on the other side without
trouble below him he watched gibs
somewhat stout form scurry across the
field and dive into the woods at the farther
end

  he kept the le pere circling above the
field at about five hundred feet waiting to
see what would happen he took time to
look over his instruments closely the oil
pressure had dropped to twenty-two-the
oil had not been renewed since leaving
donovan however that was all right
for sleepy knew the liberty was good for
another two hours of flying on the oil sup-
ply air pressure was correct at three and
the tachometer showed the motor turning
a good fifteen-fifty centigrade tempera-
ture was  -too hot due to the low flying
sleepy throttled the motor to fourteen

modern style	

hundred-as low as would keep the le pere
level-and opened the motor shutters the
final notch

  in a moment he saw the car approaching
going like mad he tilted up his ship in a
shallow bank his eyes on the ground below
him the car was a quarter of the way
across the big clearing when he saw it lurch
suddenly a hundred yards more and it
stopped on the edge of the ditch

  sleepy grinned slowly apparently gib
was strictly on the job he saw flashes of
flame as the bandits returned the fire but
there was no answering shot from the woods
as far as he could see undoubtedly gib
was holding his fire for fear of hitting his
father

  four men clustered behind the car
evidently mr saunders was not there
he wondered where the banker was pos-
sibly they had bound and gagged him in
some nook of his own house he reflected

  suddenly his eyes narrowed and the wide
mouth tightened the four men were
making a break for the woods on the op-
posite side of the clearing from where
saunders was hiding

  in a flash he saw the fatal mistake he and
gib had made by running on a course
that was a continuation of an imaginary
line made by saunders and the car they
could use the car as a partial screen all the
way when they reached the woods they
could circle around using the trees as pro-
tection and shoot gib from the rear he
would be totally helpless against four men
spread out in the woods behind him their
only chance for escape and that a slim one
was to change their tires without being
under fire in all probability they were
desperate enough to take any chance that
offered even the slimmest of opportunities
to escape

almost before these thoughts had
raced through sleepys head he had
nosed his ship down in a straight
dive motor wide open the bandits were
less than fifty yards from the car as he
came roaring across the field not a foot
above the ground and headed straight for
them

  the le pere was a thing of terrible power
as it hurled itself across the ground and the
bandits turned and ran back toward the
car the purpose of the pilot was very
evident to them


adventure

  with a grin sleepy thanked his stars that
they did not know how fatal it would be to
him if he really hit them it would assuredly
break his propeller and pile him up against
the trees at the edge of the clearing

  no sooner had he gone past them than he
lifted his ship in a beautiful climbing turn
that was almost a wing-turn the ship
was practically stalled at the peak of it but
headed back the way it had just come it
settled earthward picking up speed as it
dropped until it was once more speeding
across the ground nearer the car this time
the bandits had stopped when it went past
but as it returned they scurried the rest of
the way back to the car

  once again sleepy performed the same
maneuver if there was any flyer at
donovan field who doubted spears flying-
ability a grand-stand seat that day would
have settled his doubts wing-turning a
le pere from a foot off the ground is a ma-
neuver that leaves the pilot only a few feet
between himself and a bad crash stalling
the slightest bit too much at the top of his
climbing turn would mean a straight drop
to the ground for there was not altitude
enough to gain flying speed after it was once
completely lost at best it was necessary
almost to pick the ship off the ground as it
settled after the turn

  twice more they tried to make a run for
it the second time one man flopped face
down to the ground like a flash sleepy
nosed down a bit more trying to hit him
with the wheels in all probability it would
not hurt him badly but it would certainly
scare him effectually his idea was simply
to bounce his wheels off the mans back

  he did not succeed but with a grin he
reflected that he had not come far away for
the mans body had disappeared beneath
the wing the man started to get up as
sleepy passed to be knocked down by the
propeller blast he dived for the car with-
out delay and for ten minutes there was no
further attempt at making the woods it
looked very peaceful down there-the field
stretching big and smooth in the sunlight
four men clustered quietly around the car
and the mesquite giving no sign of the dead-
ly rifleman within its cool-looking green
shelter

  one of the bandits showed himself in-
cautiously beside the car as sleepy
watchfully patrolled low over the mesquite
he saw the man grab his arm and leap back

behind the shelter of the auto a thin wisp
of smoke arose from the mesquite it was
lucky that the bandits apparently had only
revolvers as weapons thought the pilot

  suddenly he nosed down at full throttle
all four men were making another attempt
to cross the clearing for a moment he lost
sight of them as the top wing hid them in
the steepness of the dive as he roared
across the ground they retreated near the
car and flashes of fire from four revolvers
could be seen plainly they shot continu-
ously

  as he passed them he felt a shattering 
impact in his shoulder the plane wabbled
for a moment and veered perilously as the
pilot felt the searing pain of the bullet
with an effort that left him faint he
straightened the ship as the wing-skid
dragged the ground and held it level for a
moment he lifted it over the trees and
banked around

  the lucky shot had left his right arm al-
most paralyzed every bump that hit the
ship caused him excruciating pain he
had only one hand to handle both stick and
throttle the blood was slowly staining
through his shirt and he could feel it trick-
ling down his body

  three times more at intervals of a few
moments the men below tried to outwit
him each time the roaring le pere speed-
ing toward them as they started sent them
back apparently they had no doubt of the
pilots intention to hit them with his face
white under the tan and his body weaken-
ing rapidly as the slowly gushing blood
drained it of strength sleepy fought to re-
tain consciousness

  of all the tragedies that happen in flying
ninety per cent start within ten feet of the
ground an errot in leveling off-hitting
an obstruction in landing-slipping into the
ground trying to bank too close to it-those
are the things that kill pilots spears
forcing himself to keep clear-headed and
conscious by main force of will time and
time again wing-turned off the ground to
rush back across the field before his prey
could escape

  never a time did that terrific dive last a
split-second too long and send the le pere
head-on into the earth nor did it falter and
drop as it climbed and turned together to
be ready for the next dive twice he de-
liberately tried to move his right arm so
that the agony of it would help him fight
riding herd-modern style



off the faintness that threatened to master
him

  he had no conception of the passage of
time the motor was running wide open-
he was too close to the ground to risk taking
his one good hand from the stick to cut it

  a seductively dangerous languor came
over him it seemed useless to keep watch-
ing the men below-they had not made an
attempt to break for the woods in some
time it was so silly and futile to go to all
this trouble

  he banked mechanically for a moment
his hand dropped from the stick limply and
the ship nosed up hovered on the verge of
a spin a terrific bump that sent agonies
of pain shooting through his right side
cleared his head and he caught the ship
just in time	

  the field danced crazily before his eyes
he knew he must go down or in a little
while he would cease to fight off the de-
licious drowsiness that seemed like paradise
as he thought of yielding to it just to let
himself go-

  he kicked the ship around and took his
hand from the stick he jerked the throttle
back and quickly grabbed the control again
he felt a shock as the undercarriage swept
through the top of a tree as if he were
watching some one else do it he uncon-
sciously leveled off five feet off the ground
the nose dropped and the wheels hit and
bounced for just a second the pain
cleared his head-he knew he was eight feet
off the ground but he did not care

  he fainted as the ship bounced again the
low undercarriage saving the ship from a
nose-on crash sleepy was crumpled in the
front cockpit as the le pere rolled almost
to the edge of the woods and a red-headed
figure came bounding toward it rifle in
hand

vi

spears opened his eyes and looked
up into a genial round face belong-
ing to a bald-headed gentleman of
middle age he was in bed and evidently
in a private house an electric fan buzzed
from the wall and the setting sun sent a few
beams of light beneath the lowered cur-
tains a gray-headed man was smoking a
cigaret as he sat on the edge of a table

  thats the boy grinned the bald-
headed man ruffling the thin fringe of red
hair that he possessed

  where might i be inquired spears
calmly

  he felt the bandages on his arm and was
conscious of utter weakness that was not
unpleasant

  my name is saunders and this is dr
white youre in my house son

  oh yes

  a wide grin came into being slowly as he
looked into the bright eyes above him

 how did they rescue you from the
boys he asked

gib came tiptoeing in a tall girl with red-
gold hair behind him as he met sleepys
gaze he  leaped for the bed and shook the
left hand of the pilot enthusiastically
came to did you he grinned boy

wasnt that a-

  meet my daughter mary interrupted
mr saunders and sleepy smiled up into
the face of the girl

  he noticed with approval the creamy
skin and gray eyes fringed with sinfully
long black lashes

  youre not an applicant as nurse are
you grinned sleepy

  not an applicant-ive got the posi-
tion she returned with a mischievous
light in the gray eyes

  good how did things come out gib
you rolled right up to me almost and i
taxied the ship close to the trees to have a
sort of two-way barricade i popped one
of em when they broke for the woods and i
previously had winged another one in the
arm they stopped to carry the fellow i
nearly killed-he was a fat chap-and be-
fore they made the woods the posse got
there when did they shoot you

  second or third time i went across
im some cowboy eh

  the people in the room looked at each
other meaningly as the realization smote
them that sleepy had been flying for a half-
hour or more with that wound

  it was a horribly lucky shot they made
sleepy remarked

  mustnt let you talk too much in-
terrupted the doctor who had been listen-
ing quietly youve lost a bucket of
blood and youve got a nasty shoulder
tell me a couple of more things before
i shut up begged sleepy where did
you come from mr saunders and how is
the ship did i crack up- no i
couldnt have if you taxied it gib didnt
they shoot at you


adventure

  yes but with revolvers they told us
dad was chained in an old cabin out here
he couldnt have gotten away but they did
leave him enough to eat and drink the
ship is all right-correll is out there now
and well arrange a guard for it weve
wired donovan field that youll be here
three weeks

  nothing to do but lay around eh in-
quired sleepy

  he yawned as he spoke and excused himself

delicious drowsiness was overcoming him

thats all-eat and sleep and let that
shoulder heal said the doctor replacing
things in his bag

 sleepys eyes roved to the luscious vision
 of miss mary saunders

nothing to do but lay around and be an
invalid i think im going to like it here
he murmured

 they all tiptoed out to avoid disturbing
 him

omething was standing in the
trellised moonlight beneath the
pine trees something half re-
vealed half shadow half seen
half guessed and it had not been there
a few seconds before being in england the
land of pheasant worship and the grouse
cult the shadow ought to have been a dog
or a fox-but it was not it looked like
neither of these there was something differ-
ent about it a suggestion of greater wild-
ness it was a little larger than a fox a little
smaller than a wolf and when it turned its
eyes shone green then it stepped into the
full light and became a coyote-a prairie
wolf

  the reason for so fierce a presence in so
tame a land came about as follows four
months before this coyote had struck a trap
in america-on the south fork of the stink-
ing water river to be exact one month

before he was touring england as part of a
traveling menagerie upon this night of
nights he had been fed by his keeper-who
was beautifully and unashamedly drunk

  they found the man asleep in the cage
next morning the key of the cage they
found on the floor but the coyote they
never found so much of this animals
history is known so much is public prop-
erty the rest that which follows is here
revealed for the first time it was told to
me by the wild folk and it is not given to all
to understand the language of the wild folk

  a thin high scream cut aslant the cathe-
dral silence of the pinewood a scream al-
most startlingly like that of a child and the
coyote froze he sank upon the grass
and was still eyes gleaming ears pressed
close back thin lean upper lip lifted a little
to display the cruel glistening fangs only
his flanks moved still heaving to the
the outcast



exertions of his ten mile removal from the
menagerie then quite suddenly came the
scream again and the coyote slid away on
his stomach

   he knew that cry the last protest against
fate of a terrified rabbit he came to a
hedge and peered through he saw a shad-
owy beast with a big bush-tail-something
like his own-dragging a kicking rabbit
toward the hedge red fox the coyote
noted to himself-and waited by which it
may be seen that he knew all about foxes

  reynard came on-knowing nothing in
his turn of coyotes-and slid into the hedge-
ditch with his struggling prey he preferred
to kill it here than in the open where its
pestilential squeal might attract any horror
-a keeper for instance

   g-r-r-r said the coyote a yard above
him in the tangle of hedge-roots and the fox
stiffened from head to foot he was fright-
ened that fox frightened no end for he
had never heard a growl like that before in
all his marauding life and a stoat that
was enviously watching the fox fell back-
ward down the bank of the ditch and fled
while a dry rustling flutter oerhead told
that the roosting birds had heard that
growl also and were afraid

   a head-almost wolf-like in its evil fierce-
ness almost fox-like in its leering cunning-
was thrust suddenly from out the matted
tangle and the fox visibly quailed then
behind the head came the coyote not
slowly but like a brown streak the fox
was aware of a burning pain in his near
shoulder and he pivoted cringing back
among the damp dead leaves of the ditch-
forgetting the rabbit the rabbit had not
forgotten him however it forgot nothing

   it went or rather to be more exact it was
gone for noie had seen the going of it in
the wild it is as well to grab your chance
while you can you may not get another
the rabbit must have known but if that
rabbit thought-do rabbits think-he had
check-mated his foes he counted without
the coyote check it may have been but
mate was not yet

  in a second the fox-badly bitten as he
was-had picked up himself and also the
rabbits trail whereupon he went with-
out comment into the moonlit haze and
soon as he galloped the rabbit danced
before him he could see it a fleeing
shadow a bunched up ball and a stretched
out streak alternately

  bunny had no illusions the drumming
of the four-footed death on the short grass
behind left no room for any he wanted to
get back to the warren which was not far
away very badly indeed he would have
got thereif a strange thing had not hap-
pened-a thing neither hunter nor hunted
expected

   the fox was first of all aware of it a long
lean silent gray shadow which shot-it
almost seemed to fly so quick was it-past
close to him- it had eyes aflame that
thing and he shied at sight of it as a fright-
ened horse shies in a flash it was ahead
the rabbit may have heard it coming but
it is doubtful if he knew what killed him
followed a glint of fangs as the apparition
shot up alongside the luckless bunny a snap
but no pause at full gallop this ghostly
specter had killed and picked up the quarry
swung round in a wide circle and vanished
away still going like the wind into the
night then at last the fox must have
realised that this was his new enemy of the
ditch the coyote that strange giant foxy
apparition which had come out of nowhere
at him and gone again as a whirlwind
might into nowhere for aught he knew

  having dined the coyote set off across
country at the long tireless wolf gallop
that will run down almost any four-footed
thing in the end he had no idea how far
that menagerie might pursue him and he
was taking no chances a wild creature
never willingly takes chances

  once-that was when he bee-lined over
a bare blunt-nosed hill-a line of hurdles
leaped up in front of him he took them
in his stride and fell among ewes many and
loud voiced ewes who rose up as one sheep
and ran about complaining in a full throated
chorus seeing that the poor outcasts one
notion at that time-possibly at all times-
was self-effacement this action on the ewes
part was unkind for one thing it caused
him to fly the opposite line of hurdles like
a bird and for another it awoke a long low
blue beast from nowhere special which fell
in dumbly at the coyotes heels the shep-
herd called it a bob-tailed sheep-dog but
it looked more like a silent devil in the light
of the cynical moon it took the coyote
half an hour to shake that speechless horror
off his track

  once also-that was when he was gingerly
rounding the corner of a cattle-muddied
gateway-he fell on to and over a warm
i

adventure

feathery live thing which got up and snored
away into the night on vast flapping wings
more uncannily than any ghost the next
five hundred yards he must have covered in
record time for he was scared almost into
rabies the thing was an owl a white owl
and a big one at that though what it was
doing in the mud of a gateway no one
knows perhaps some rat could have told
rats are generally intimately-too inti-
mately for their liking-connected withthe
doings of owls

  and once-that was the worst fright of
all-he barged head over heels into some-
thing that he could not see stretched across
a gap and it clung he fought madly for
a space rolling about snapping and tear-
ing like a thing possessed for this nightmare
held on all round him followed a curse
from the shadows and after the curse a
man and after the man a dog-a thin lean
dog this time the coyote did not like the
appearance of that dog it looked under-
hand and even a mole could see that it was
built for speed

  this may explain perhaps why he bit
the man on the hand-his teeth met i am
told-and went away into the night with half
the unseen terror which clung wildly flap-
ping from his hind quarters the man
swore strange oaths and went away in a
hurry which seemed strange as a matter
of fact however the coyote had run into
a poachers net stretched across a gap-way
for the entertainment of certain hares and
the poacher was about as scared as the
prairie-wolf over the meeting

  an hour later came the dawn-cold un-
pitying matter-of-fact dawn--and it dis-
covered this coyote in the middle of a gorse-
and-bog-patched moor he went into re-
tirement for the day in a foxs earth which
he sought and found in a great hurry the
stench of the place-for there are few
fouler abodes among the wild folk than the
den of the little red rascal-made him very
literally and shamelessly ill he knew
however that anything-even the most
appalling effluvium-is better than for one
of the night prowlers the outlaws to be
found abroad when the sun is up

when evening fell and the shad-
ows hunted the raw red sun home
to his lair the coyote thrust out an
inquiring muzzle and thrust it back again
in a hurry a man was coming through the

gorse-a jet black shadow carved out as it
were against the crimson sky came he to
the foxs earth and dropped a rabbit by the
entrance he gave no reason for so strange
an action but the reason-seven of them-
had been found killed in his fowl-house
three nights before-and the rabbit was
poisoned evidently this tit-bit this gift
gratis was intended for the entertainment
of the rightful owner of that den and he
happened to be away upon a blood raid
in the opposite direction

  the coyote waited ten minutes after the
man had gone then he wriggled out to the
rabbit he gave one sniff only one then
he went away also straight as a die and
very swiftly with every hair along his back
sitting up all bristly you see he was ac-
quainted with poison he had cause to be
for he had once on a time watched his
mother die beside a poisoned carcass and
the terror of the taint which had hung in the
air round that carcass lived with him ever
after it had been a nightmare and the
mere whiff of poison a hundred yards to
leeward had the effect of terrifying him for
hours

  like a hunted cat this wolfish beast that
was not a wolf panicked across the face of
the sullen moor then he caught sight of
his own shadow cast by the dying sun-
a blue figure against blood red grass-danc-
ing along at his side he never waited to
think but shot away ten yards in three
bounds-and stopped

  there was no question about the stop-
ping one moment he was racing at i dare
not say what speed the next he just-wasnt
moving and the suddenness of it nearly
wrenched him to pieces he had simply
bounded full into one of those quagmires
one of those abominations which pock-mark
so many moors but no flies settled on this
beast he did not wait even so long as
one second if he had he would have been
a very dead coyote and he knew it

  how the miracle was accomplished how
without appearing to pause or think or hesi-
tate he was able to rebound again exactly
as if he had landed upon a spring-board in-
stead of a quaking shaking sucking death-
trap is beyond mere human knowledge
from this bound he reached a tuft of deer-
grass at least one presumes he reached it for
he barely touched it rebounding for the
second time and on to firm ground at last
being somewhat scared he ran on for a few
the outcast



yards along the edge of the bog before he
discovered that he was exhausted some-
what and sat down

  it was the hour of brooding calm when the
suns last rays lingering charmed the pur-
ple heather into a deeper tone in the pine-
wood behind him-such was the silence-
the coyote could hear the hollow purr of the
air in the upper branches like the humming
in a shell and the tiny tumult of an ant
city the indescribable slithering undersound
which can only be detected in very still
places night was stalking westward swiftly
over the purple lakes of heather

  a jay screeched gratingly somewhere
way back in the wood the last woodpecker
had fled laughing into the shadows the last
family of titmice had trailed by twittering
and twee-jeeing to each other through this
hall of a thousand columns presently came
a long-drawn sigh echoing down the pillared
aisles and after the sigh a big brown bird
flapping like some gigantic moth that was
a long-horned owl and it flew without sound
as an owl should

  suddenly the coyote turned his head
something-some swift moving shadow-
was coming across the bog how any beast
heavier than a mouse could cross that quak-
ing abomination was past understanding
but the shadow proceeded leisurely and un-
flustered enough and it did not sink in-
stantly the coyote the outcast slid to a
heather patch on his belly and lay there
crouched his green glazed eyes fixed and
staring at the shadow

  the apparition came on bounding lightly
from tussock to tussock of deer-grass half
insolently half playfully it seemed toying
with the suffocating death that it only es-
caped by a hairs breadth at each fairy-like
bound

  the coyotes lips dripped as he watched
his eyes took on a crueler glow the thing
was a deer he knew the breed the slender
legs the arched hind-quarters the graceful
step as if the beast were walking on air
as a matter of fact she-it was a she-was
a roe-deer but this he did not know he
took her for a prong-horn antelope perhaps
or a white-tail deer-but no matter his
tactics would be the same

  she passed him-he had taken care to lie
well to leeward-quite close so close that
as she vanished like some spirit of the wood
beneath the trees he saw the transient
gleam of her white rump quite plainly for

a minute he waited-time enough for her to
penetrate the wood well out of sight

  then he dropped his head and with tail
slightly lifted settled into the long easy
wolf-gallop on her trail he must have
known by the scent how close he was-or
how far-for never once did he sight her or
blunder on to her heels in the pine gloom
nor was she once startled or aware of her
tracker thus nicely did he judge his pace

  as the trail broke from the wood and led
straight now as a die over the open moor the
pace increased the lone night wind whis-
pered in his ears and the night-hawks and
bats did their own small hunting above him
but he never lifted his head his eyes were
glued on the way ahead only his restless
ears took note of that which went on around

  once a fox halted in the middle of trailing
a rabbit to stare at this big wolfish beast
loping by with gleaming eyes and once
something which was not a fox-though it
was as big-stood in his path chattering
obscenely forcing him to go round that
must have been a badger

  finally-this after an exhibition of clever
windings twists and turns-the trail led
toa spruce firwood black as a well and
still as a well or death here was needed
great caution and the coyote slid belly flat
the whorls of the trees came down and
brushed the needle-carpeted ground diffi-
cult to avoid hard even to creep through
hard that is when even the faint sound of
brushed back branches would have ruined
all in that desert-like silence

  suddenly as if some cold hand had seized
him the coyote sank where he stood sank
and was still like one that is stricken sud-
denly by death in front was a clearing
no more than a gap shadowed as to its
center by one lone big spruce fir and
beneath that lonely shade stood the doe
and she had business with something that
was there she was anxious that deer
anxious and happy making odd little noises
in her throat-and beside her were two
more shadows

  then she stood out before the moon and
there followed her two fawns their great
beautiful eyes shining like stars dainty
spirits of the shades-sleek shining satin-
eared velvet-nosed dappled and light as
thistle-down upon legs slender as hazel
wands

  how long the coyote lay and watched that
wonder is not known some hours perhaps
adventure

he might have been a figurecarved out of
dark and light oak for all the signs of life
he gave only his eyes lived those green
orbs with the strange coldness of cruelty-
cruelty is assuredly a cold passion-ap-
parent in their depths

  at last a badger-clumsy shuffling
furtive and morose-passed in the gloom
he was in a hurry that beast and when a
badger is taken that way dawn is not far off
this the doe knew-or seemed to know
she vanished with her double charge slowly
under the pall-like shade of the giant and
isolated spruce and when she came out
again she was alone

  as a smoke puff fades so faded this elfin
like haunter of the woods the flash as of
a faintly gleaming lamp caused by her light
rump as she whisked away was all the indi-
cation a watcher would have had of her
departure

  the coyote followed a slinking evil form
in the gloom followed her to the edge of
the wood far enough to see the roe-deer
safely on her way-but no farther he had
other work on hand

  in five minutes he was back again by the
miniature clearing crouching motionless as
before watching always the gloom beneath
the spruce that stood aloof and the sky
paled to gray even as he crouched so in-
tently were his cruel eyes fixed upon this
spot that he never saw a shadow-surely it
was no more than a shadow-which drifted
up from nowhere special behind him-
drifted and stopped

  the minutes dragged on painfully almost
as if the dead silence the stagnant air was
waiting for something to happen

a fox passed slinking and car-
mine tinted about the jaws a
pine-marten rippling in faultless
curves the incarnation of living moving
grace went by in the dawn and his jaws
also bore the blood stain the badge of out-
lawry a squirrel slid down perkily from
some tree near at hand and slid up again
in a hurry when it saw the couched coyote
the fox was red the pine-marten was red
the squirrel was red the watching waiting
shadow behind was red all of them red
against a background of reddish tree-trunks
and pine-needles lighted up all together
and suddenly by the fiery red of dawn that
wonderful dawn which comes after the gray
and is followed again by a day of gray rain

  suddenly the coyote moved sat up and
the shadow-the shadow was gone only
a gleam as of twin stars a flash as of a low
burning lamp hastily extinguished marked
its disappearance and made one half suspi-
cious as to whether it had really been a
shadow after all and half doubtful as to its
ever having been there at all this also
the coyote did not see

  then the wolfish beast moved forward-
almost flat he proceeded--and his caution
was evident at every careful creeping stride
there was still darkness under the great
spruce and for a moment he stood con-
fusedly then in a soft place just the
least noticeable spot exactly where they
would be most difficult to get at he saw the
fawns they were lying down but not
asleep they were looking not at him but
past him behind him at something that
was there-the shadow had come back
again

  a gleam of white fangs scintillated in the
growing light but there was no sound as the
coyote half rose and dived forward headlong
upon the helpless fawns they tumbled to
their feet they could run fairly well fast
enough to avoid a man but not a coyote
and they fled

  then without any kind of warning at all
the shadow took unto itself life it hurled
itself forward head down preceded by short
but rapier-sharp horns at the speed of a
powerfully shot arrow and its mark its
goal appeared to be the coyote it was a
full-grown roe-buck and of all the cloven-
hoofed ones the roe-buck is the least
troubled with fear and flurry

  the coyote was behind one of the fawns-
just about to deliver one of his quick chop-
ping bites on the flank in fact-when he
became aware of a small-sized whirlwind
hurtling down upon him from behind

  he realized his danger and pivoted upon
himself presenting a fanged and snarling
front in one and the same second so it
seemed being specially designed to do so
but in the next second he was removed quite
twelve feet by the sharpest pair of horns and
the most impetuous buck he had ever run
up against when he regained his feet-
which was practically the same moment as
he touched the ground-he was furious
for this buck was only small-no larger than
a pronghorn antelope and the wound in his
shoulder pained abominably but he had
made one blunder he had not reckoned
the outcast



upon the peculiar character of the roe-buck
-there are deer and deer and the roe-deer
is unique

  next moment the whirlwind was upon
him again the fury of the charge was ex-
traordinary and amazed the half-recovered
coyote he did not-being only an outcast
wolfling-stand up to it but skipped to one
side and delivered one of his chopping flank
bites a whirl of pine-needles followed for
the roe-buck can turn as can no other deer
and the coyote fell backward as the quick-
est way to avoid a hissiiig slash of those
terrible forked little horns

  thereafter things happened and hap-
pened quickly the coyote was no amateur
in the matter of keeping a whole skin by
agility and agility alone but the deer he
knew were not like unto this little fury he
leaped and side-leaped and sprung back-
ward pivoted on his tracks spun like a top
rolled from under the flying hoofs raced like
a greyhound and generally performed on an
average thirty acrobatic feats a minute
his foe however plunged and stabbed
jabbed and hacked stamped and tore and
raged and fumed and bucked and backed
and thrust and cut and slashed and
foamed like unto some four-footed fiend
the coyote might have been a magnet and
the buck a piece of steel so close did they
follow one another

  now a coyote unharried and unpressed
is many kinds of a coward but a coyote
cornered and hanging on to his life by his
whiskers is just any sort of a devil you like
to name this may be why at the end of
five minutes of this death dance there were
triangular gaps on the roe-buck-chiefly
about the flanks-where the flesh had been

removed in chunks on the other hand the
coyote was striped much as is a tiger only
the stripes were red not black

  followed a collision i dont know how it
happened one of the combatants must
have made a mistake somewhere any-
way they met it was a bundle that is all
you could say a huddle and it was not nice
to behold the needles flew all whither
and the earth followed suit which beast
was where it was impossible to say save
for the horrible low and continuous snarling
of the coyote there was no sound but one
knew that death hovered round that jumble
of legs and bodies

  then with startling suddenness it
ceased-the fight was over the roe-buck
was standing rocking in his tracks as a tree
rocks in a gale the coyote lay on his back
ten yards away and both were unpleasant
to behold were unclean to the sight

  slowly the coyote heaved on to his feet
and stood staring stupidly-himself rocking
to and fro-at his enemy then like a
broken thing-reminding one in a singular
way of some half-killed insect-he dragged
himself away into the red eye of the rising
sun a shocking nightmare of a beast a blot
on the beauty of the dawn and even as he
went the roe-buck toppled forward on his
nose and lay still-for ever

  as for the coyote he blundered drunkenly
half blinded and half choked straight
ahead to the open moor and its scattered
bogs and into a bog and under it for ever
and all time

  and that is why the dozens and dozens
of people who scoured the country for that
lost and outcast coyote never found him-
and never will

r tudgay second mate of
the ship yattaroi stood at the
shore gangway gazing irritably
along the stretch of wharf at
dunedin his ship was a big handful for
the crew at his disposal and getting ready
for sea was too big a job five apprentices
two of them first-trippers constituted the
entire available gang of the ships com-
pany sailing in the yauaroi from lon-
don only these and the captain were left
and captain kirk was even now scouring
dunedin for a crew of any sort to carry his
ship to sea for he feared he might yet lose
his boys who knew little and cared less of
the legal tangle of words which demanded
a cash forfeit from the parent of each ap-
prentice defaulting his indentures there
was a lure for healthy lads in new zealand
the land of pink terraces and tattoed ma-
oris as for the rest of the defaulting hands
-crew cook steward and the first mate
himself-they had only followed countless
examples and struck off to seek fortune in
their own way

  blessed good mind to hop it myself
grumbled mr tudgay

 he caught sight of the youngest ap-
prentice grinning as if he had overheard the
shameful confession and was tempted to
turn loose his wrath in physical visitations
on the youngsters curly head the sight
of a cart approaching the ship laden with
boxes and bottles of the skippers private

i

stores swung his mind from an unhealthy
subject to a more wholesome one he
aroused the boys with a resounding deep-
sea roar and sent them scampering down
the gangway

  bear a hand and put those stores in the
captains stateroom and watch yourself if
either of ye broaches anything he ordered
and turned away as a decent mate should
to hide a grin for the boys almost before
the cart had stopped had filled each a grimy
fist from a basket of peaches with the devil-
ish skill and uncanny instinct possessed by
all sailing-ship boys since the first wreck on
ararat

  the chief thing was that the boys were
employed and would be for half an hour
which gave mr tudgay a legitimate excuse
for standing idly gazing up the wharf in
case the captain arrived the uttered
decks were not so littered as they appeared
for most of the rubbish was broken dunnage
and useless bits of discarded staging which
were to be put into the cooks bunker or
hove overboard as soon as they were beyond
the harbor and the hawsers were ready
the topsails and courses jibs and spanker
were bent-sufficient canvas to carry the
vessel to sea-and the staysails and tgal-
lantsls royals and gaff-topsail could be
sent up and bent while under way providing
the captain had managed to scare up a crew
with two arms and legs apiece

  the second mates cogitations were broken
the cook of the yallaroi



off suddenly by the heaving into sight of
an imposing procession led by captain
kirk in person looking a bit out of place
with his dignified air and gait-the more so
by contrast with his following and the
straggling line was flanked by two hand
trucks containing a collection of nondescript
sea-going gear that would have disgraced
a rummage sale a little way apart but
still with the crowd a big darkly handsome
man strode along carrying a bright new
portmanteau in his capable hand as if it
were a ladys handbag instead of a man-size
piece of luggage weighing sixty pounds or so

  shake a leg down below boys yelled
mr tudgay through the saloon skylight
on deck wi ye and bear a hand oh
corks theres a full crew for us lads and
a bloomin don juan packing his own dun-
nage that looks the spit of a liner mate
mr tudgay this is the mate mr-

mr-

  galway the new mate supplied smil-
ing brilliantly and making the second mate
squirm with the grip he gave him hope
well get along all right mr tudgay
yed better grunted captain kirk
darkly get a move on wi yer sea gear
mr galway and well off to sea the tugs
due now an weve lost plenty time
crew signed on sir asked tudgay as
the new mate vanished to change into more
suitable attire for working the ship out

  yes snapped the skipper impatiently
then saw the reason for the query

  the men were slouching about the gang-
way as if none of them had the least notion
what part of the ship they belonged to
of them all only two showed intelligence
the cook went directly to his galley and
already the rattle of pots could be heard
one seaman had gone direct to the fore-
castle and now appeared dressed for work

  get forard you the skipper roared to
the rest are ye thinkin to make it a
pleasure trip get changed and tur-rn to
cant ye put life into them mr tudgay
are ye second mate or am i here you
parson-looking son of a waterspout aft wi
ye and start yerwor-rk are ye a steward
or are ye not

  a weedy round-shouldered pale-faced
biped who looked as much like a washed-
out parson as anything else shambled aft
and followed th skipper into the cabin with
eyes upturned in shocked amazement at the
manner of his greeting his lips muttered

soundlessly and his fingers writhed as if he
were passing a benediction upon a crew of
cannibals the moment before he was in-
troduced to their cook-pot

  the new mate came to time smartly
whatever his appearance might indicate
and tudgay fell into line easily after mr
galway had been on the deck of his new
ship two minutes he was certainly a full-
rigged chief mate if he did look rather more
suitable for the high bridge of a shiny liner

  the old mans picked us out a ripe
bunch sir grinned tudgay as he fell to
work on his half of the gang and started
singling up the shorefasts

  overripe mr tudgay very much over-
ripe did you take a slant at the cook
only man in the crowd who seems to
know which end of a ship goes first grunt-
ed the second mate

  aye but take a good quiz at his hand
some dial man

  the mate plunged into his own duties
and speedily made a working gang out of
the indifferent material at hand the cook
was already peeling potatoes seated on the
bitts abreast of his galley door tudgay
scrutinized him keenly after the first
real look he could scarcely take his eyes
away the mans face looked as if the two
ugliest human faces extant had been twisted
up together as two wet dishcloths might be
then wrung out flattened and prodded
into shape roughly with the prongs of a tor-
mentor until something like a face was
evolved the mouth was a slash the eyes
were set in two slits-but the eyes them-
selves held the fire of the tigers one ear
was half-gone upon the forehead was a livid
scar the uncouth head was set however
upon a neck like a tree which in turn rose
out of shoulders and a chest that would not
have shamed an eight-foot hercules and the
arms hands legs and hips were in harmony

  whats your name cook asked tud-
gay curiously regarding the man

  peters sir joseph peters

  youre a regular he-man aint you
you ought to be in the focsle instead o
peeling little spuds youd make a top-
hole bosun

  i dont like the forecastle sir the men
are so rough replied the amazing cook in
a voice which would have reverberated over
the harbor if given range but which sound-
ed muffled and dumb as if through sheer
apprehension
io

adventure

  the second mate was to experience a big-
ger surprize yet when the ship was bow-
ing to the great ocean swell just before let-
ting go her towline he was at the monkey-
rail overseeing the placing of the booby-
hatch and the new steward emerged from
the main-deck saloon door bearing a dish of
ingredients for the cabin dessert tripping
slightly over the high door-sill the parson-
like steward gave vent to what sounded
suspiciously like a real ripping back-o-
beyond curse and then abruptly resumed
his solemn aspect and gait and proceeded to
the galley but the surprize came when the
cook the big herculean cook got up from
his own door-sill with amazing alacrity at
a sharply flung word from the steward and
took the dish from him with the air of a
subdued underling

  at the moment the chief mate having
seen the tugs line let-go was passing to
superintend the making of more sail when
the steward turned aft again and almost
collided with him there was a very sub-
dued exchange of words even the second
mate could detect that since he was
watching keenly then the mate loudly
warned the steward to look where he was
going in future and they separated each to
his job then the cooks grotesque visage
was thrust out of the door and for five
seconds he regarded the pair of receding
backs with a gaze of such bitter intensity
that mr tudgay involuntarily turned away
with a shiver

  the incident might have suggested a
mystery to any one except a buoyant
youthful second mate scarcely out of his
time to whom the world was a round ball
made in such fashion that good square-
rigger sailors might be developed on out-
and-home voyages to the colonies which
constituted a circumnavigation of the globe
every time as it was tudgay was far
more concerned in thinking what the luck
of watch-picking would bring him out of the
frightful mob of incompetents struggling
with uncertain hands and feet at the
appalling task of putting sail on a full
clipper

one of captain kirks good habits
was the holding of deck church
every sunday forenoon and per-
haps it was all the better as a habit inas-
much as his ship always carried a number
of boys out of decent homes with sunday

arriving and his ship stretching away on a
composite great-circle track for the horn
with his hulking scowling incapable crew
at least hammered into some sort of shape
and ships business going on with more or
less smoothness through sheer capacity of
himself and mates captain kirk set the
boys to work laying out reading-desk and
books on the poop and cast speculative
eyes upon the parson-like steward

  skeets ye look as if some time ye had
taught sunday-school he said can ye
conduct a sairvice for me

  i could have done a while ago sir re-
plied the steward in a voice simply soaked
with humility but im a backslider sir
a sinner and a renegade sir and j can not
make a mockery before those young inno-
cent lads please excuse me sir

  mr tudgay turned away with a face
convulsed

  innocent boys he choked i wonder
how much o the cabin delicacies the inno-
cent boys ha robbed him of already

  he might also have wondered what such
a smug-looking steward such a model of
humility had said to that tough-looking
cook on the first day aboard to send him in-
side his galley so hurriedly but since there
was no substitute captain kirk would not
permit service to be delayed the skipper
took up his place at the desk himself at the
break of the poop where all hands could
hear and bade the mate muster the men
aft

  the men came dubiously only half an
hour before they had all been turned out
on a sunday morning top to brace up the
yards a trifle and were sullen about it for
there were enough among them who had
made at least one voyage who knew that
immemorial custom at sea gave sunday to
the crew and but for crass stupidity they
would have enjoyed the rest too except
for standing wheel in turn for the
weather was fine even if the wind had not
yet settled down true they came and
stood beside the mizzen hatch sullen and
muttering while the captain opened his
book and began to read service

  midway to the end the wind came ahead
again and without stopping longer than to
give the order the skipper sent both mates
with half the men-those whose regular
watch on deck it was-to trace the yards
sharp up even while mr tudgay howled
hauling chanteys in the waist to encourage
the cook of the yallaroi



the men the service droned along its inevit-
able course and never once did captain
kirk seem to take his eyes from his prayer-
book but he was the shipmaster even
while he played parson and the end of the
service was more than a little broken in con-
tinuity

  as it was in the beginning- thatll do
th foreyard- is now and ever shall be-
vast hauling that- world without end-
well th mainyard mr tudgay- amen
-turn to ye useless lumps and coil up the
gear

  the skipper finished flung his book down
and stamped the poop cursing to high
heaven the fate which had sent him such
a double-left-legged lot of sons of blind
tailors for crew and audibly wondering
what sort of mates he had inherited that
they could not lick a crew into shape in
three days at sea perhaps the crux of the
matter was overheard by the second mate
at the pantry skylight after he had resumed
charge of the deck and captain and mate had
gone below to prepare for the noon observa-
tion under the little square of barred
glass the steward stood in his tiny pantry
handing out to the mate a cup of cold black
coffee left over from breakfast

  ever see anything like it skeets de-
manded mr galway with a queer chuckle

  never the old fool ought to be easy
returned the sometime meek and lowly
steward in tones not at all like those he
habitually used

  mr tudgay walked away he scarcely
noticed the change in the stewards tone
but he did notice the lack of respect in the
stewards attitude and wondered no longer
why his own watch were already far ahead
of the port watch in ability

bounty islands and antip-
odes islands both the merest
groups of specks in a waste of blank
chart lay on either side of the yallarovs
legitimate course both groups are desolate
both have government food and clothing
caches there being in those old clipper days
ample need for such to succor not infrequent
sailing-ship castaway crews on some
groups a boat is left in some secure crevice
on the auckland group two boats were al-
ways available on the antipodes it was
harder to keep such valuable aids and the
single boat alloted to the group had been
stolen more than once by passing whalers

   

though to do those splendid seamen justice
they nearly always left an addition to stores
to pay for the boat only the exigencies of 
whaling and the stem necessities for sound
boats of the capable type used on those
island stations tempted an occasional
whaler to accept the gift of the gods and
sail away with a new boat

  mr galway seemed well versed in all such
matters he would talk for an hour to the
second mate about the time when he was in
one of the government vessels depositing
those stores he even went so far as to talk
for an hour with some of the unseamanlike
crew about the islands once so the ugly-
visaged cook asserted he had shown a chart
of the ships track to two of the seamen and
chatted to them about it in a manner very
unlike that of a good chief mate

  the cook told the steward about it and
the steward spoke to the skipper bring-
ing the inevitable result the old man sent
for the cook and raved at him from the
head of the poop ladder mr tudgay and
two of the boys stood a little aft and
could not avoid hearing the rave

  the old man was peeved wasnt he
tudgay asked of the mate with a grin when
watches were changed later

  he ought to be retorted mr galway
with a fine air of indignation you want
to watch that plug-ugly cook mr tudgay
if im any judge of men hes cooking trouble
as well as poor grub

   i thought it was about chatting with the
men that the old man ragged-

  well it wasnt and ill thank you to
mind your own business the captain
called the cook down because he carried
yarns about me the chief officer and said
i was hobnobbing with focsle hands forard
o the galley you know as well as any-
body that i was trying as always to teach
em a bit o sailorizing

  mr tudgay ought to have known better
of course he should certainly have known
better than to carry his indiscretions so far
as he did after supper when he was alone
for a moment with the skipper on the poop
he was rash enough to disclose to captain
kirk his suspicions that mr galway-the
immaculate mate of such wonderful hand-
someness as the steward had been heard to
call him-and some of the least seamanlike
of the crew were too thick for the welfare
of any sailing-ship bound home horn ward
the skipper glared at him for a full thirty
adventure

seconds puffing up like a woman on the
verge of hysterics then he opened out

  mis-ter tudgay i ha seen traces o
insubordination in ye and the boys since
leaving dunedin and ill not have it ill
ha ye to know that mr galway is as fine
a fir-rst mate as i ever had and a sight
better than yell ever make yere talking
the same guff as yonder criminal-lookin
cook and i war-m ye an ye can pass it
along to yer ugly friend that if i want to
know o aught amiss being prepa-ared
against the ship i shall seek for t in th
galley and among galley friends rather than
among the loyal par-rt o the after-guard
ha no more o it ma man

  all the same sir id watch that steward
if i had command the second mate per-
sisted rashly

  he really ought to have known better
he was not a first tripper

  go to yer room roared the skipper
prancing go to yer room for twenty-
four hours and if i see no sign o yer
retur-min sanity then ill disrate ye

-me a-boy would ha more sense

  youre right-than a blasted thick fool
of an old man muttered tudgay and
ducked below for a full round of watches of
sleep and meals scarcely hoping that his
punishment would be carried out but de-
termined to endure it in real comfort

  at a quarter of an hour before middle
watch that night one of the apprentices
tapped at tudgays porthole and found a
wide-awake listener to his report

  the helmsman he said was that
quiet-looking chap that talks to the cook
hes the only one as does sir he heard
all the old man said to you and when i
went forard to rouse up lamps for the
binnacle lights i saw em both very deedy
in chat the cook caught me by the arm
and dragged me inside and told me to come
along for a dish o collops-here it is sir-
passing a covered dish of savory steamy
viands through the porthole-and told me
if i blabbed a blessed word to anybody else
hed scrag me and clap me into the copper
whats up sir isnt trouble is there
trouble repeated tudgay sniffing
hard at his favorite dish and setting the
food carefully into a snug corner of his

locker-top dont talk so - silly

see what i get for mentioning trouble
yes sir i know but that quiet a b
that was in the galley he pinched my arm

till i nearly hollered and told me in a voice
like a blessed snakes that hed skin me and
eat me raw after the cook got finished with
me if i said a yap either about your grub or
about the old mans outbust and he
aint one to chatter without doing either
mr tudgay

  i never saw him do anything grumbled
tudgay eager for his meat but more
eager for news

  well nobody else did till tonight
chuckled the boy full of his subject

  he was standing within the covering
shelter of the half-deck speaking through
a port hidden and inaudible to all except
an intending eavesdropper and that he had
apparently guarded against

  but the apprentice continued i saw
him take on that big whale of a murderer-
lookin cross-jack-eyed sailor in the port
watch and hammer seven bells out of him
sir and-

  what burst forth tudgay lick that
tough youre as mad as-

  its a fact insisted the boy excitedly
same tough as mr galway and the
steward have been so thick with cookie
was referee because all hands o the watch
wanted to chip in on the side of the plug-
ugly you betcher sir the cook said about
two words to em and they stood back
hide the dish when its empty sir here
comes somebody

  the boy vanished into the shadows of the
main-course like a bit of itself and left mr
tudgay to his reflections which were none
of the clearest youthful as he was yet his
sea time had been spent during a period
when it was nothing unusual for a sailing-
ship to change crews three or four times in
a round voyage and in australia new zea-
land or the west coast there wer strange
characters always ready to take the places
of deserting crews and that with the sole
idea of getting as far and as fast away from
their shipping port as possible

  runaway convicts weary of chain-gangs
and breakwater slavery unfrocked priests
beyond shame at their fall deserting sol-
diers defaulting smug crooks from places
of trust and sheer crooks-all these went
to make up crews of those glorious old clip-
pers that gave all the romance and spirit
to the glorious old sea mr tudgay had
seen every type and though he had never
experienced any deeper trouble from such
crews than apprehension he was still young
the cook of the yallaroi

enough to retain a sacred belief that one day
big trouble must burst right under his nose

  now he was certain that the trouble-
laden voyage had come he disliked many
of the crew he distrusted the parsonlike
steward and through him the too friendly
chief mate he wasnt sure about the alarm-
ingly ugly cook but had been inclined to
like the man especially so since receiving
that steaming dish of scotch collops the
spoon of which he was even now licking
but since devouring the savory mess he had
begun to think deeply and now he recalled
the amazing subsidence of the powerful
cook at a single word from the sharply
different steward he recalled with growing
astonishment the boys report of that gor-
geous forecastle fight in which the quiet
slightly built seaman who was a friend of
the cooks had whipped the toughest-looking
bully in the gang

  the threat of the cook to scrag the boy
and make stew of him was lost in the newer
puzzle of the skipper captain kirk had
never failed to show a subtle power in deal-
ing with refractory crews before but here
was the one time when he apparently fell
down hard for tudgay could attribute his
own temporary disgrace to no other source
than the mental aberration of the old man

  he lighted a pipe turned into his bunk and
prepared to thresh out the whole matter in
the peaceful solitude of his snug prison he
found his tobacco unaccountably difficult to
keep alight he lighted the pipe a half-dozen
times then concluded that there was some-
thing amiss more than damp weed for his
pipe was cold the last time he put match to
it though he was convinced that the five
minutes strenuous drawing at it following
the previous ignition must have made the
bowl hot- then the poop bell struck four
bells

  me sleeping like that he growled and
slung his legs over the lee-board rubbing his
eyes foolishly and trying to remember any-
thing queer in the taste of those collops

  nothing that any man could have said to
him at that moment could have altered his
opinion that he had been drugged that
sheer sleepiness could make him fall asleep
was absurd to him he was still puzzling
when a yell pealed up on deck that brought
him to the floor and at the cabin door in a
flash

  fire arose the yell fire

  almost immediately the key was turned

im his lock and the door opened wide he
burst through into the warding arms of the
skipper himself rubbing his eyes and mak-
ing for the companionway in his pajamas

  on deck wi ye mr tudgay and see
whats amiss the old man cried i
canna let ye bur-run though i believe yeve
been the cause o this wi yer insubordina-
tion up wi ye man

  tudgay went choking back the hot re-
tort that rose to his lips and found the ships
company milling in a strange sort of frenzy
about the poop ladders while the mate with
two sleepy boys beside him bore himself
more like a liner captain at a fake fire-drill
on a swagger passenger steamer than the
mate of a prosaic old butter-and-mutton
wagon caught on fire in the wastes of the
extreme south pacific

  captain kirk went past the chartroom on
his way to take charge and glanced at the
ships last position as pricked off the run
since previous noon brought her within reach
of the bounty group of islands and rocks
he joined the mate at the poop rail

  what haye done what are ye doing
he demanded have ye ascertained the
source of the fire where is it man

  mr tudgay is seeking it now sir re-
turned the mate with exquisite calm he
has two a bs and a boy but ive seen
these fires before sir and if i might make
a suggestion i would say we had better run
for the islands in case of disaster

  i ha never yet pairmitted slack mates to
lose me a ship mr galway and if the
lor-rds willing i shall not pairmit such
now retorted captain kirk with a hard
glance at the debonair mate

  get ye down yon wi mr tudgay and
bring me yer repor-rt shar-rp	-

  the smoke reek smelled like nothing
recognizable though captain kirk sniffed
with all the sagacity of a forty-year sea-
mellowed nose for a moment he lost sight
and sound of the crew failed to catch the
ominous note in their deep mutterings and
strove with all his faculties to put a name to
the amazing aroma carried by the swirling
smoke tinned mutton and tub butter
alone make a cargo hard to set fire to the
butter might make a blazing inferno of the
fire when started but neither it nor the
canned meat would be likely to catch fire
without strong inducement from outside
besides that puzzling reek was more remi-
niscent of very boyish days than of a grave


adventure

marine disaster he was still puzzled when
the mate rejoined him shrugging his shapely
shoulders

  afraid the ships doomed sir mr gal-
way reported the butter is melting and
soon itll catch the ship will be like a pow-
der-mill then sir i would suggest we make
for the bounty islands while the ship floats
then if we have to take to the boats safety
isnt very far away

  in the lantern light at the main-hatch the
crews faces were turned aft expectantly
expressions ranged from brutal indifference
to sullen ferocity like a hideous mask the
ugly face of the cook appeared among them
and as he faced the poop his features were
awork with some undecipherable hope long-
ing or fear

  he caught the captains eye just at the
moment when together the mate finished
speaking and that strange reek explained
itself as glance met glance the cook dis-
appeared through the hatch and the mut-
tered growl of the crew rose fiercely

  by christmas i have it roared the
skipper thrusting past the mate and leap-
ing down the ladder mr tudgay do
ye keep the poop and hold the course ill

see fr masep-

  better let me go sir the mate called
out and started to follow

  the skipper flashed back

 stay where ye are i sent ye to seek and
ye smelled a trouble i believe is not here
he reached the hatch and the mutter-
ing ceased through sheer wonder at his ex-
pression

 touchwood punk rags he mum-
bled as he flung his leg over the coaming

  in another instant his eyes were water-
ing and his lungs labored in a thick blanket
of pungent smoke through which his smart-
ing eyes made out a red glow against which
an uncouth monster shape silently toiled
at some devilish task

  he recognized the cook and in a fury of
blind resentment for the trouble on hand
hurled himself forward with hands groping
for the mans throat he gasped sharply
when his own strong hands were seized in
a grip like a vice yet as gently as might be
and thrust aside from the cooks crooked
lips came the soft warning

  easy sir easy dont be hasty im
helping you i knew what was the matter
but the crew would have murdered me if i
made any move to let you know i took

a chance when i saw you coming and ive
nearly got it out now here sir see the
trick

  the mans eyes glittered and his entire
face writhed in horrible mirth captain
kirk stared at him dubiously and bade him
stand aside then he flung himself upon
the smoldering pan of smoke-making ma-
terials and killed the last red spark before
ordering the cook to precede him on deck
a grimace of still intenser subtlety con-
vulsed the cooks face and he seemed to
hesitate then with a shrug he obeyed and
ran up the bulkhead ladder like a great cat
leaping on deck with a crouch and with guard-
ing arms as if expecting a vicious assault

  nothing happened and the skipper came
up to find the entire crew following the
mate around the ship pulling on a brace or
sheet here turning up a coil there growling
the while like a cageful of surly bears the
cook halted as the skipper reached the deck
waited as if to hear some comment on his
own case then at a brief nod turned and
slipped into his galley and shut the door
silently

  captain kirk stared after the man with
open mouth then shook his puzzled head
and joined the- second mate on the poop
the helmsman was the same quiet seaman
who had whipped the forecastle tough and
the faint light from the binnacle played on
his face as he raised his eyes to the star he
was holding course by his lips moved as if
he too were muttering and a spasm of rage
swept through the skipper from toes to
fingers

  the fires out mr tudgay he snapped
 it was a dir-rty trick played for some hid-
den pur-rpose which i shall seek and find
yet will ye keep close watch on yon ugly
devil of a cook i ha doubts o his pair-rt
in this queer business

  the cooks all right hes about the
only one as is burst from the helmsman
and the skipper regarded him blankly
amazedly

  the man reddened and fixed his eyes on
his star again shifting uneasily on his bare
feet conscious that he had permitted his
tongue to carry him into the unforgivable
offense--forcing way into a conversation of
his officers without warrant as if aware of
the gravity of his fault and in desperation
determined to be hanged if at all for a
sheep rather than a lamb he blurted out
again-
the cook of the yallaroi

  tts the mate you want to watch

  captain kirk peered into the second
mates face suspicious that a sound he had
caught was too much like a chuckle for
respect tudgays face was wooden but he
could not hide the gleam in his eyes and
the skippers mouth was opened to demand
attention to duty which would include
punishment of the presumptuous helms-
man when the mate ascended the poop
ladder and briskly approached the skipper
with a smile that might have meant any-
thing from congratulation to amusement
captain kirk stepped forward to tell him
what the helmsman had said but tudgay
reached out touched his sleeve and said
quietly but penetratingly

  dont tell him yet sir i can tell you
something thatll give reason for the mans
charge

  mystery on mystery growled the
skipper angrily but he merely received the
mates report with a nod and so far ac-
ceded to tudgays request as to refrain
from telling mr galway what the seaman
had exclaimed

  but he was reminded of tudgays recent
confinement to his cabin and permitted
himself at least one safety valve

  yell be able to carry on now mr
galway he snapped mr tudgay
retur-rn to yer room ill ha chat wi ye in
the mor-rning

  tudgay dipped through the companion-
way doors like a flash too well pleased to
think of anything but unbroken slumber for
the rest of the night he had no idea what
the theatrical fire meant but placed small
importance upon it since it had been dis-
covered and smothered the thing might
even have been a monkey trick of some of
the boys perhaps to gain access to the but-
ter in the hold for apprentices got no butter
in the yallaroi anyhow it could be nothing
serious

  hi decision was shocked back upon his
mind in the next instant entering the
saloon to go to his room he came upon the
steward working feverishly to bundle food
and blankets anywhere out of sight as he
stood watching the man in wonder the
skipper entered and uttered a gasp of aston-
ishment as genuine as tudgays

  what in the wor-rld are ye doing
steward

  i heard the cry of fire sir and consid-
ered it my duty to prepare stores and blank-

ets against a boat venture sir replied the
man with a greasy smile on his pallid face

  tudgay passed on to his room unwilling
again to risk the skippers displeasure
a glance at the dour scotch face showed him
that anger and irritation were very near the
surface

  and why are ye not retur-rnin the
stores and blankets to their proper places
now that theres no need for them

  i have been laboring under stress sir
i believed it would not matter if i simply
put the things out of the way tonight and
asked for some of the boys to help me in the
morning

  well maybe maybe grunted the skip-
per go t yer bed then i doubt yere
a poor body o a man anyhow get awa
wi ye

  growling deep in his honest breast
captain kirk crossed over to his stateroom
and scowled fiercely as he passed the second
mates cabin at finding the door a little open
and hearing tudgays voice accosting him

  i told ye to tur-rn in mr tudgay he
snapped and turned the key in the lock
again

  the irrepressible tudgay popped his
head through the fanlight over the door

  i tell you sir you must listen he said
i have to tell you something youll be sorry
if you miss it concerns the safety of the
ship and all hands-

  the skipper had passed the door but the
words arrested him he stood still for a
moment fingering his stubborn chin then
he stepped back unlocked the second mates
door and entered closing the door softly
behind him

  well be shar-rp wi yer croaking
i ha small patience left for ye

 tudgay went to the porthole which
looked out upon the recess of the half-deck
wing and peered out the port opened in-
wards and was hooked open to an iron de-
pending from a beam a stout iron cover for
bad weather was fastened to the bulkhead
outside

  come on wi yer yarn snapped the
skipper impatiently

  tudgay turned to him with a queer look

  i thought i caught sight of somebody
listening outside sir he said

  as he spoke the skippers head jerked
around toward the door he leaped to it
with something like belief and as his hand
touched the handle the key outside was
adventure

turned in the lock at the same moment
the iron cover to the port fell with a heavy
clang and the turning of the big screws
could be heard plainly

  there sir cried tudgay excitedly

i told you-

  silence man retorted the skipper
furiously why did ye not mak me hear
ye instead o blatherin by little bits about
mysterious troubles here clap yer shoul-
der to the door

  one assault they made and a voice from
the saloon cried

  dont try it cappen next time y bang
on the door ill put a brace o lead slugs
through the panel

   what dye mean roared kirk

  keep civil and maybe no harm will
come to you returned the voice

  then came the sound of conflict some-
where forward the report of shots the clash
of weapons the curses of savage men

  the skipper and tudgay stared at each
other in speechless awe but gradually into
the juniors eyes there crept the inevitable
i-told-you-so gleam which even the des-
peration of the moment could not prevent
the skipper detecting what he might have
said about it was halted by a violent im-
pact of bodies against thehalf-deck bulk-
head the shrill cry of a boy in pain and the
roaring chorus of men in pursuit farther
away a seaman swore bitterly a shot rang
out then came the sound of running feet
and the ghastly suggestive crunch that an
ax makes when biting into flesh and bone

  oh man groaned captain kirk in
horror why did ye no mak me listen
whats to be done poor galway

poor- 

  poor swine retorted tudgay savagely
i told you to watch him sir hes at the
root of this ill bet my life-if i save it
he hurriedly related that little conversa-
tion at the pantry door when the steward
confided to the mate that the old man
ought to be easy captain kirks keen eyes
glittered coldly and his face grew hard and
stern as he listened

  outside the cabin all seemed quiet but
forward far in the bows sounds were not
wanting to indicate that at least some of the
crew were loyal to the ship and were putting
up a fight

  and dye say yon parson-faced steward
thats so thick wi the mate frightened the
cook into silence wi a wor-rd cried the

skipper bewildered i thought the cook

  i know sir and i told you he was all
right so did the sailor tom peters now
were in a boiling stew whatll they do
with us

  well know soon ma poor chappie
replied the skipper with unwonted quiet-
ness the noise is finished and i doubt
theres no more o oor friends on deck
poor poor laddies look yon

  he pointed out through the small round
port-glass in the ships side the stars
were sweeping past in a line of glittering
splendor

  theyre swingin her north a
a knock came at the door and a rattle of
the handle

  take yon fire-ax ordered the skipper
fiercely

  then he crouched beside the door of
which the key was outside and yelled in
answer to the knock

  we ha an ax the first man to show
his head loses it

  the silence was suddenly intense it
seemed to tudgays strained hearing as he
stood on his toes with every muscle tensed
to bring down the murderous blade as if
a sibilant murmur as of quietest whispering
ran through that awful quiet of the saloon
then the knock was repeated and a piti-
fully small voice the voice of a boy called
quaveringly	 

  its only me sir let me in

  whos wi ye boy demanded the
skipper suspiciously

  the key was outside and there seemed
to be no reason to ask admittance

  only me sir

  the assurance lost its value by reason of
a sob wrung from a tortured body at the
end

  theyre all here captain the lad

screamed dont-

  a savage curse accompanied a heavy
chopping blow and the boys shriek rose
and fell into the silence of death

  by - tudgay burst the door

roared the skipper and hurled himself at
the panel

  the stout oak stood with a quiver

  gi me the ax then oh the devils
the filthy devils

  dont sir pleaded the second mate
in a whisper if they want to get in and
can not somebody has taken the key since
the cook of the tallaroi

we were locked in theyll murder us both
if we burst out before we can pick ourselves
up and we cant save the lad sir we may
save the ship with cunning

  the argument barely reached the furious
skipper but it told and he fell back con-
tenting himself with a final warning howled
through the fanlight

  if a man shows his head ill pit th ax
to it shar-rp let the mate come doon and
talk ta me ye murderin scum

  a savage voice swore and a head arm
and gun were thrust in through the opening
above the door

  drop that ax the man growled and
swung the gun upon tudgay

  brain him wi it yelled the skipper
and with the words leaped like a cat at the
protruded gun-hand and forced it down-
ward

  tudgay struck with the back of the ax-
head and the gun clattered to the floor in-
side the cabin the man fell back among his
fellows with a hollow grunt leaving the
white paint of the door streaked with crim-
son

  capn youd better submit came the
mates silky voice with a suspicion of a
harsher fiber woven in the silk now the
key is lost tudgay must have a spare one
inside throw it out and ill see if i can
make terms for you if youre stubborn
well starve you first then burst through
and handle you

  captain kirk sputtered with anger the
hot retort hovered on his tongue when
tudgay seized his arm put a finger to his
lips and pointed to the side porthole a
soft tapping sounded on the glass and the
face of brooks the oldest apprentice
frightened but still plucky appeared in the
circle the tapping came from a door-key
in the boys hand

  with a gasp of startled gratification at the
knowledge that at least one of his lads was
safe the skipper motioned tudgay to open
the port while he himself answered the
mate  through the fanlight the tone he
used efficiently drowned the small noise of
opening the port

  i have no key tudgay has no key-
his canny scotch conscience urged him to
mutter yet under his breath-and if we
had all the keys in the ship id make no
ter-rms wi a dir-rty mutineer i ha a gun
and an ax and a detairmination to see ye
all hanged for gallus-crows as ye are do

yer wair-rst ye ruddy pirate and be -

to ye

  youll starve

  we can do that-but i doubt we wont

  the men are desperate theyll-

  they may do their-est

  weve two more of the boys well
let you listen to them squealing outside
here

  kirk wavered at this he cast a poignant
glance at tudgay the port was open fresh
air came in and the second mate held up
a door-key the boy who was hanging
precariously over the ships side with one
hand to the poop gunwale shook his head
vigorously and whispered sobbingly

  im the only one nigh and they aint
got me yet and they wont

  the boy stopped abruptly clapped his
free hand alongside the other and wriggled
upward out of sight as if he had caught a
warning sound on deck skipper gazed at
second mate and both saw in the other a
resolve to fight

  ill hear one squeal fair-rst he replied
to the threat

  a deep rumble of voices seemed to fill the
saloon but galway made no retort and
silence fell again leaving the captives in
a quandary as to its meaning

  maybe this is the only gun sir sug-
gested tudgay

  likely but i widna believe any man
fool enough to try to carry a ship o this
size wi one weapon whats yon screech-
ing

  both listened then tudgay darted to the
window that opened on to the half-deck
recess which the mutineers had bolted
outside the screws of the iron cover were
turning tudgay shut the port gave the in-
side butterfly nuts an extra twist flung the
thick red curtains over the glass and pinned
them then stood aside motioning the skip-
per to the other side and both waited for
the new assault

  well soon know about the guns mut-
tered kirk his eyes aglitter as he watched
the saloon fanlight against surprize from
that direction

  soon the outer cover was raised and
hooked and a hearty volley of deep-sea
oaths followed the discovery of the blinding
curtain over the inner glass a port glass is
a thing of marvelous toughness and yields
to nothing less than terrific force so far as
forcing it unless with gunfire or blows of a
adventure

maul the outer iron cover might almost as
well have been on a few futile blows with
the port-key followed then galways voice
sounded in peremptory command the
voices outside receded and soon the greater
angle of the ships list told of freshening
wind and work on deck

  pairhaps theyll leave us alone a while
now remarked kirk

  he was peering in every corner of the
little cabin and his gaze darkened every
moment while the little circle of the side
port grew lighter with dawn

 ha ye no outlet-no hatch to yer
room he growled

  tudgay raised the square of faded carpet

  there was the hatch into the old sail-
locker sir but when you built the sail-
room on deck you had the carpenter calk
this up the removal of the carpet re-
vealed a square hatch flush with the floor
and the line of pitch around it was hard and
shiny with age and the chafing of the carpet

  and whats beneath now

  a wing of the store-room sir spuds
and flour mainly i believe

  har-rd stuff to shift wi such small
scope mused the old man with a shake of
the head but man we must do some-
thing gi me the ax and do ye get busy wi
yer knife tak oot the calking mak no
noise and keep yer eyes peeled at yon fan-
light they fell to work as a yell echoed
through the ship from the direction of the
foremast

as the horizon silvered with the
first light of day three dark figures
huddled in the foretop silently
helped a fourth on to the platform beside
them

  i got the key to them cook the new-
comer brooks said gleefully panting and
bright-eyed from his perils encountered in
passing the key through tudgays port-
hole his subsequent indian-like avoidance
of enemies and his climb aloft

  good boy muttered the ugly cook
clapping the lad on the shoulder softly

  the other larger figure resolved itself into
the quiet sailor who had so manfully pro-
claimed the cooks honesty to the skipper
while at the wheel besides these and the
boy just welcomed another boy crouched
there wide-eyed with fright but quiet and
willing to share whatever might come

  the lightening decks beneath them were

deserted apparently except for a small hud-
dle of men right aft by the wheel but here
and there about the galley and forecastle
dark splotches lay on the clean planks which
looked queerly like sleeping men yet sug-
gested more than sleep

  the cook laughed bitterly as he scanned
the ship and his laugh was a thing of horri-
ble mirth for his head was roughly ban-
daged in bloody canvas and one powerful
arm still dripped blood from a hastily tied
handkerchief at the bend of the elbow the
seaman tom was in no better case for his
blue check shirt was a ghastly plaster of red
and his hair needed no pomatum to slick it
to his forehead the smaller of the boys
quivered with the pain of a long shallow
flesh cut down his face and of them all only
brooks appeared unhurt still the cook
could laugh

  well lads he said cautiously stretch-
ing a cramped foot over the edge of the top
somethings got to be done right now
heres daylight and theyll see us in a little
while then we shall be targets for their
guns whenever we try to move theyll
shoot us if we go down and starve us if we
stay up here-unless the captain and mr
tudgay bust loose and surprize em which
i dont exactly count on

  the old man and tudgayd be mutton
by now if it wasnt for johnny brooks here
as pinched the key out o the seconds door
remarked tom i dont understand what
its all about they never took me into
their conflabs

  they did me though at first grinned
the cook looked more like one of them-
selves than you maybe didnt you see
how they waited on me coming out o
the hold when i showed up the fake
fire

  but what is their notion piped brooks
he shivered in the cold dawn and his
companion a first-voyage boy cowered
between the men fearful of what daylight
might bring to add to the horrors of the
night

  theyll be copped sooner or later the
boy went on and murders been done
theyll all stretch rope wont they

  aye surely meanwhile theyre in
charge of a fine ship well found full o grub
apart from the stores and heading noth
far away from any shipping track toward
the littlest known part of the pacific

  the cook hesitated with a keen sidelong
the cook of the yallaroi

glance at the sailor who met his glance and
held it an instant then nodded

  might as well out wi it joe he said
 t wont make no difference that i can
see if we get clear youve done your bit
enough to square yourself anyhow if we
dont-

  the interrupted sentence was more ex-
pressive than many words the cook
glanced down upon the still silent deck and
went on

  short and sweet then every man-jack
o this fine ships crew from mate and stew-
ard down to me-thats exceptin tom and
you lads and the skipper andecond o
course-is a wanted bushranger and sheep-
thief yes me as well sonny he grinned
in answer to a look of incredulity on the
face of the younger boy

  only difference is that they all cut and
run and got away while i got jailed but was
let out by the front door never mind why
now galway and the steward was the two
bosses of a gang o cattle-lifters and i knew
em all years ago but quit em when i got
pinched while out on business for the gang
theyd just reached dunedin in a stolen
boat when the old man found me and
shipped me for cook tom already had a
job here and steered me to him in five
minutes galway steps up asks for a chance
and gets the skipper jumpin for joy by
offerin him a full crew steward and all
complete

  soon as they see me they thought to
rope me in along with them and told me
their scheme they was to take the ship
though they didnt say how at first sail her
nigh to bounty islands and shove the skip-
per and boys and second mate ashore there
where they neednt starve because of the
government stores and where the visiting
ship would be sure to call in a few months
tom here they figured on either taking in
along with them after he knew the plan or
slipping him over the side if he refused

  soon as i see that fire i knew it was the
first trick and when galway proposed
standing up for the islands i was certain of
it this mutiny is the final bid and bloods
been shed

  there wont be any landing on well-
stocked islands for the old man now
theyll kill us all starve us or shoot us
unless we get top dog pretty quick they
wont stop for nothing with the wide sea
before them and a stout ship to carry em

to some place where nobody knows em and
shipping men aint overparticular about real
ownership when a fine vessels offered for
sale at a foolish price

  you ought to have told the captain at
first cried brooks

  i tried to replied the cook simply
didnt ye see how i never moved a peg on
deck wiout somebody dogging me did
ye not see how the steward always brought
or sent the galley stores along for me so
that i never went aft laddie i was worth
more to you and the rest alive than dead
thats no lie neither growled tom bal-
ancing his sheath-knife on his palm and
glaring hungrily down upon galway who
was just emerging from the saloon com-
panionway

  at the same moment galway glancing
aloft in the way all good sailors have on
coming on deck whether they are good or
bad men or only indifferent caught sight
of the huddled figures in the top now in
growing light clearly distinguishable from
the bulk of the masthead and the main-
topgallant-staysail tied up there a ripping
oath escaped him and he cursed his helms-
man and the men on the poop luridly for
failing to detect and account for the
refugees before pointing to them he or-
dered them brought down

  aye come get us roared tom and
his knife flashed in a deadly streak straight
at galway

  only the swaying out from the mainmast
of a main-buntline-the mainsail was furled
-deflected the knife and sent it quivering
into the planks two feet wide of its aim

  now youve spilled the soup growled
the cook angrily

  two men started forward and climbed on
to the rail at the fore-rigging but in the
nearer crisis the cook appeared to see some
cheering factor for he chuckled

  tom blast me if you aint swapped that
knife to some purpose he said now we
know they aint got any more guns or
them men wouldnt dare try to get us that
way look

  at the other rail two other men started to
climb and four seamen together approached
the futtock rigging with knives in their
clenched teeth while below aft galway
flogged them on with vicious oaths the
cook produced his cleaver suspiciously dark
as to blade and spat on his hands but his
face grew stony as he noticed that his was


adventure

the only weapon the sight of it however
protruded over every edge of the top in
turn caused the four climbers to be wary
before setting foot on those overhanging
futtock-ratlines

  go on roared galway savagely he
can only get one o you

  come up yerself then an let him play
wi you yelled back a dubious mutineer

  at the same moment he made a deter-
mined upward dash grabbed at the top
then swung downward again as the cleaver
sang and bit deep into the structure of the
top but the men on the other side had
seized the opening one darted upward
reached over and grabbed one of the boys
by the leg wringing a cry of terror from the
lad like a big ape the cook twisted around
flung himself full length across the plat-
form and brought down the cleaver upon
the outstretched arm hand and forearm
parted from the rest at the elbow and the
man fell headlong to the deck below show-
ering those in the top with spurting drops

  galway roared but the mans shriek
drowned his roar on the other side again
two men made an infuriated rush and now
the cook saw the hopelessness of it all

  up tom he gritted darting from side
to side with chopping blows up with
you by the main-t-gallant-stay up boys
after him can ye climb sonny he asked
pausing a second to place his hand gently
upon the bowed head of the younger boy
sure ye can laddie up wi you all now
and if ye make it we have them

  one by one the boys swarmed aloft on the
stay tom taking last place instead of first
and immediately under the trembling boy
in case he needed a cheering word or a help-
ing hand the cook kept the top inviolate
through sheer animal tirelessness and agili-
ty until the attackers drew back for breath
no man can hang indefinitely to futtock
rigging and fight with one hand glancing
aloft the cook saw tom reach the topgallant
masthead and make the boys secure then
peering over the edge of the top to be sure
of his distance he slung his cleaver to his
neck with a rope-yarn stop cut from a coil of
small rigging and swarmed up the stay
after his fellows

  now if they follow up the stay i can
chop down a bloomin army panted the
cook unslinging his fearsome weapon

  but galway was watching and as soon
as the first man crossed the foretop and

gripped the stay to swarm to the mainmast
his voice rose in a savage bellow

  come down you blasted lunatic all of
you come down and get after em by the
main rigging

  one man remained on deck by the fore
shrouds to guard against swift descent
another stood by the main and galway
himself watched the mizzen then every
available mutineer swarmed aloft on the
main determined to overwhelm that little
bunch of clinging figures high up on the
slender topgallantmast and a new influ-
ence entered into the game the parson-like
steward skeets emerged from the cabin
door glanced over the ship and spoke in
a sharp tone to galway who glared fiercely
but made no retort

  come down all but two of you yelled
the steward who had apparently assumed
command

  the men climbing almost under the
main-top paused in the breathing-space
the cook seeing the precariousness of his
position on so frail a hold slithered down
a backstay and gained the main-top where
he might still do stout service against his
attackers the boys were safer farther aloft

  come down and work the ship cried
the steward leave em up there theyll
come down when they get hungry or
thirsty

  the men hesitated some descending
others seeming to hang upon galways
orders the steward flung his arms about
in rage and cursed the mate

  leave em up there and whos to stop
them spotting a ship and signaling her be-
fore we can yelled galway

  shoot em down then

  aye i might if you hadnt sent the old
man a present of the gun bawled galway
thrusting his convulsed face close to the
pallid visage of the steward

up aloft the cook and his companions
begn to take keen interest in the row the
hesitating seamen in the rigging began
slowly to follow their descending mates j
tom at the maintopmasthead with the
boysicalled down softlyland the cook heard-j
joe theres smoke to the suthard
up to the truck wi ye then and bend
yer shirt to the royal-pole for a signal o dis-
tress returned the cook

  then sure that it would be done he
turned his attention to the little scene on
the poop
the cook of the yallaroi



  it swiftly reached a climax when the
steward having lost completely all vestige
of his godly aspect brought up his fist in
a lightning-like uppercut to galways chin
that knocked him clear off the poop into
the arms of the first hurrying men in two
jumps the steward was upon his foe again
but now the men took a hand some hauling
galway clear others rallying around the
cock-a-whoop steward and with galway
on his feet again pale with rage coldly mur-
derous of eye the fight closed in grim
silence not three blows had been exchanged
before all hands closed in a milling savage
melee

  it was one of the boys who first caught
sight of a cautiously protruding head at the
lazaret-hatch abreast of the wheel the wheel
that swung as the ship plunged along un-
attended since galway who had taken it to
send every available man after the fugi-
tives had left it in turn to beard the
steward

  tom joe theres the old man the
lad cried scarcely lowering his voice from
its piercing treble

  had he shouted the news none of the furi-
ous mob on deck would have heard it for
blood was flowing now knives and belaying-
pins hammered and cut while galway and
skeets were locked in a death grapple
thumbs at eyes or fingers sinking into
throats

  aloft at the main truck flew a blue check
shirt bravely proclaiming to all who saw it
in the ancient language of the wind-driven
navy that a seaman wished to quit his ship
tom slid down and as he passed the lads
he bade them follow him for the cook was
calling them softly and all the while he was
striving to attract the attention of that
peering head aft

  huddled in the main-top they saw cap-
tain kirk hoist himself swiftly through the
hatch and turn to give a hand to tudgay
when both stood free plastered from head
to foot with flour like millers armed with ax
and revolver one of the boys excitedly cast
to the winds all caution and threw his
leather-vizored cap at them it pitched fair
at the skippers feet and in a moment com-
munication was established by arm sema-
phore

  sure of the situation now the skipper
and second mate advanced to the poop rail
each snatching up an iron pin from the
mizzen rigging as he passed in case of need

and stood gazing down upon their foes
battling for them the brutal fight had
reached a point where no outside interfer-
ence could break the intense application of
the combatants to the business in hand
the mate and steward swayed and stum-
bled blindly among the others knees tot-
tering breath wheezing through red froth
at the bps galways handsomeness had
departed like a summer cloud under the red
disfigurement of an empty eye-socket the
stewards lips were drawn tightly back from
grinning teeth but his pale face had grown
purple

  come on tom gritted the cook
lads stay here you can do no good
the things amost over anyhow now
tom

  this time he gripped the cleaver in his
teeth as he swarmed dowft by a backstay
closely followed by the seaman as they
reached the deck the cook darted into his
galley and emerged wielding the tor-
mentors-a fearful weapon that huge salt-
meat fork in capable hands

  take the cleaver tom he said grip-
ping the great two-pronged fork and lets
clean this thing up

  they rushed aft and reached the edge of
the fight without notice the deck was lit-
tered with groaning ruffians and stained in
great dark patches the skipper and tud-
gay leaped down the ladder to join their
allies as the two chief combatants pitched
headlong and brought down others in their
fall

  tap em lads gi em a bit wallop ta
quiet em sang out the old man and
suited the action to the words by knocking
all the fight out of a cursing scrapper with
a blow of his iron club

  so far had the fight gone that there was no
call for cleaver or fork ax or pistol in less
than half a minute the two belaying-pins
had scattered all the remaining wits of the
mutineers and then the lads were called
down to fetch rope to bind up the fallen

  put the ship on her proper course mr
tudgay till we ascertain damages said
the skipper coolly turning over the mate
with his foot

  galway breathed stertorously his limbs
twitching the steward breathed too but
faintly

  tom sighted a steamer making twards
us sir said the cook we flew a signal
to her


adventure

  he pointed aloft where the shirt fluttered
brightly against a clear sky

  i doubt if any steamerll want to relieve
us o such cattle muttered the old man
shaking his head sorrowfully as he remarked
the state of his ship and thought of round-
ing the horn with such a crew even if he
got them in hand again

  if so be as its a government steamer
sir as is by any chance looking for us shell
be only too glad to take care of em said
the cook simply

 why what do ye know mon

  tom chipped in and told the skipper
briefly the history of the crew and gradu-
ally captain kirks eyes were opened wide

  he said nothing until he had taken the
binoculars aloft and regarded the distant
steamer intently for several minutes then
he too used tre backstay for speedier
descent and sent brooks to take the wheel
while tudgay looked up the code-book and
deciphered the several signals repeated to
him

  what d they say

  new zealand naval steamer sir telling
us to heave-to until she looks over our
crew

  then ye were r-right cook cried kirk
with emotion i ha been blind well
ha ta go back now for a crew i doubt un-
less yon steamer can spare us men bring
her by the wind lads we ha no men to
heave her to ill hoist a signal masel to
tell him so

  but cook i dinna want ye ta be taken
wi these gallus crows ye say ye were wi
em once see mon if ye hide awa below
ill tell em ye were killed and chucked

owerboard awa wi ye yonder comes the

steamer

  joe dont have to hide sir tom blurted
out

  let the mon speak fr hissel

  he wont im his brother and i speak
for him joes done his bit in chokee but
he aint wanted he got his pardon same
time as he got his face all chopped up like it
is wi the shovels of mutineerin convicts as
was trying to murder the warders get yer
parchment joe in case tis wanted

  the cook now that the emergency had
passed resumed his air of unobtrusiveness
that had marked him since joining the ship
he went to his sea-chest and returned aft
clutching a folded paper with much the same
expression as a boy wears when presented
with a certificate for good conduct in front
of his mates the look sat queerly upon
his marred face but he broke into a quiet
grin as the steamer swept around and
lowered boats and the dour scotch skipper
remarked

  ill ha ma eyes owerhauled before i sail
a ship ta sea again i thought yon steward
skeets looked like a pure-white woolly
lamb and ye looked to be a shaggy wolf
cook i asked the mon ta read a sairr-vice
the fairst sabbath oot dye mind

  a-ah weel tis the frailty o us poor
humans i doubt yere all wool cook all
white fleecy wool fr all yr har-rd mug
and- the steamers boats were alongside

   our camp-fire came into being may   with our june issue and since then
its fire has never died down many have gathered about it and they are of all classes
and degrees high and low rich and poor adventurers and stay-at-homes and from all
parts of the earth some whose voices we used to know have taken the long trail
and are heard no more but they are still memories among us and new voices are
heard and welcomed

   we are drawn together by a common liking for the strong clean things of out-of-
doors for word from the earths far places for man in action instead of caged by cir-
cumstance the spiritof adventure lives in all men the rest is chance

   but something besides a common interest holds us together somehow a real com-
radeship has grown up among us men can not thus meet and talk together without
growing into friendlier relations many a time does one of us come to the rest for facts
and guidance many a close personal friendship has our camp-fire built up between
two men who had never met often has it proved an open sesame between strangers
in a far land

   perhaps our camp-fire is even a little more perhaps it is a bit of leaven working
gently among those of different station toward the fuller and more human understand-
ing and sympathy that will some day bring to man the real democracy and brotherhood
he seeks few indeed are the agencies that bring together on a friendly footing so many
and such great extremes as here and we are numbered by the hundred thousand now

    if you are come to our camp-fire for the first time and find you like the things we
like join us and find yourself very welcome there is no obligation except ordinary
manliness no forms or ceremonies no dues no officers no anything except men and
women gathered for interest and friendliness your desire to join makes you a member

a word from j d newsom in connec-
tion with his story in this issue

new york city

  the custom of allowing captives to live a fairly
free and independent life until their heads are
needed may sound queer but it is an actual fact
such men are allowed to marry into the tribe and
usually go to their deaths quite cheerfully when the
time comes their children however belong to the
mothers clan group or moiety and are allowed to
grow up under the tutelage of their maternal uncle
it is a rather quaint custom-j d newsom

to my relief and surprize my explana-
tion to camp-fire of our magazines
use of dashes instead of cusswords was
strongly backed up by nearly all the letters
that came in and there have been a lot of
these letters im glad i cant see my
way to any other course in the case of this
particular magazine and on the other hand

i dont like to follow any course to which
the majority of you are opposed

  but i forgot to cover one point two of
you raise this point vehemently in letters
to me and they are i think quite right
dashes for cusswords yes but when it
comes to dashes for god hell devil
etc used not as cusswords but in a per-
fectly legitimate way theres no need of
dashes yet our magazine has on various
occasions used them in such cases that
use of the dash is as offensive to me as it is
to any of the rest of you im agin  it
and always have been but there are seven
of us on the staff and while most of us have
been here for years there are changes now
and then as there are a few thousand
other things to watch out for this distinc-
tion in the use of dashes isnt always fol-
lowed or even clearly seen




adventure

  for that matter its often hard to draw
the line those of you who have read proof
know that style and consistency are often
hard to maintain on one side the line
youll get a series of cases each case lead-
ing logically on to the next demanding for
it the same treatment and all of a sudden
youll find youve crossed the line-and
done it logically too or stated the other
way youll put one case on one side the fine
later put a second case on the other side
and then find theres no logical distinction
between the two

  we have lots of arguments on the staff
over cussword cases when is a cussword
a cussword sounds easy to answer but
sometimes we dont find it so also as
stated already sometimes we just make
mistakes

  our intention is to use the word itself
whenever it is not plainly a cussword as
used in that particular instance some-
times well make mistakes or at least our
judgment will differ from yours just be
easy on us and credit us with good inten-
tions

  another thing in poetry well let em
ride even as cusswords unless they get too
dog-goned bad that isnt quite logical
perhaps but when the word is essential to
the rhyme it is pretty violent stuff to stick
in a dash

an interesting report from one of
 our comrades of the gentler sex regard-
ing daniel boones brother and his family
in general

  the name and fame of daniel boone are insepar-
ably connected with the history of kentucky the
old pioneer has been honored in many ways and at
the present time a fine statue of him clad in hunt-
ing garb coon-skin cap rifle in hand stands in
cherokee one of the most beautiful parks about
louisville

yf any of the descendants of daniel and his broth-
ers still live in the state the old boone home-
stead being located at boones landing about thirty
miles below the city on the ohio river and not far
distant is the site of an old mill built by the boones
at a place caeed booneport the descendants of
hiram boone a brother of daniel live at boones
landing and a member of the family the late
grandison boone used to relate that when a small
boy he saw daniel boone who stopped there on his
way to missouri to bid his kinsmen good-by
grandison boone had but a childish recollection of
the old trapper but his description of him tallies
exactly with that of others who saw him at that time
boone had blue or gray eyes and brown hair and at

the present time many of his lineal descendants have
the same while the collaterals are brunettes their
dark hair and eyes probably inherited from boones
wife who was a bryan

t have been present at many of the family

  gatherings of the boones which country-bred
folks would call dinings early in the day the
members of the various families would begin to ar-
rive men women and children horses mules and
hound dogs the squawking of chickens would be
heard huge baskets of vegetables would be borne in
from the garden long rows of cakes were outspread
in the summer kitchen while in the inner kitchen
where the chefs of the household were on duty the
most luscious odors would fill the air city folks
would stand aghast at the generous supplies of food
prepared and its infinite variety

  meanwhile the men sat under the trees discussing
crops and politics over tall glasses of cold mint
juleps some chewed tobacco some smoked reeky
pipes while the horses and mules taken out of the
traces browsed contentedly close by the hounds
tumbled in the grass with the youngsters or loafed
about the kitchen door slobbering in delicious an-
ticipation of the feast

  when dinner was served all the guests sat about
a long table loaded to the guards with eatables
fried chicken rosy old country-cured ham chicken
and dumplings corn pudding field beans and bacon
bacon and greens tomatoes raw and cooked butter
beans spoon com bread rhubarb heaps of snowy
mashed potatoes buttermilk and hot coffee pie
cake preserves of all kinds pickles all the riches of
field garden and orchard were outspread while the
women of the immediate household waited on the
table and purged their guests to help themselves
bountifully-uncle hiram you must take some
more cake cousin squire i want you to sample
my cornbread and aunt becky i made this
lemon pie after your own recipe

jphe conversation was boone from post to finish
all the happenings in the family births mar-
riages and deaths old stories were revived par-
ticularly one to the effect that when the state of
kentucky brought the remains of daniel boone and
his wife back from missouri the real bodies were
never given up but weights placed in the caskets
so that the coffins buried with so much pomp at
frankfort hold no honored dust but as most of the
kentuckians know no better they are perfectly
satisfied another story revived and retold was
that of daniels brother squire boone who it is
stated by historians was killed by the indians

  the family indignantly disclaim this statement and
declare that he settled in indiana on the ohio near
boone township and there raised his family there
was a small cave near his home and on the walls of
this cave squire carved religious and worldly-wise
sentences one of the former ran i sit and sing
my souls salvation one of the latter was to the
effect beware of intentions for fear of preven-
tions possibly intimating that it was foolish to tell
what you intended doing last some one frustrate
your plans

  when old squire felt his end was near he got his
coffin and selected the cave for a place of burial
he made his three sons promise solemnly to place
his remains there sit up with them for three days
and nights then close up the entrance forever
the camp-fire



this they did and for many years the old man re-
mained unmolested in his rocky sepulchre

qome time in the s--purchased a farm

  on the kentucky side of the river below louis-
ville and it was there that he died on a black storm-

swept night his son-- a thoughtless

rollicking young man spent some time on this farm
having for his companion a member of one of the
oldest and most aristocratic families in the state
one day these two accompanied by a negro servant
and their hunting dogs crossed the river in a skiff
and went hunting in the indiana woods during
the trip they imbibed freely from their hunting-
flasks and after wandering over a big stretch of
country finally stumbled on the boone cave

  i have never heard whether they knew the story
of this cave or not anyhow in a spirit of reckless-
ness they broke open the rude entrance dragged
the skeleton of old squire from its resting place and
scattered the bones about everywhere it is whis-
pered to-day that a distinguished member of the
boone family now living has one of the leg-bones
of old squire though he can never be persuaded
to admit the fact even to his own household

  -and his gay companion finally withdrew to

their boat and the negro rowed them back to the
kentucky shore fully convinced in his superstitious
mind that the party was damned forever it is
certainly true that -- had persistent bad luck
after this escapade and died a violent death while
the boones regarded his taking off in the light of a
retributive justice

  the waters of the ohio still glide peacefully past
the cave the forests have disappeared and prosper-
ous settlements sprung up close by but the memory
of old squire boone lives immortal in the traditions
of his descendants and those of his brothers one
and all they snap their fingers at the historians and
their story that the squire was killed by indians
and declare that he died peacefully in his bed wear-
ing his scalp to the last-elvira millie slaugh-

  so now i am come to take a place at the camp-
fire to meet with other read dr s adventurers and
authors the first i have ever been the second
some little time and the third have but now be-
come hence this standing up and this bow and this
present writing for all that i am of tender years
i have been with the most of those about this fire
what time they were in the far places of the world
upon their different occasions he that went down
to the sea and reefed topsails in the gale and passed
the weather earing i have been with him albeit i
stayed in on the yard in the bunt and clung to the
jack-stay with both hands for which i was beaten
about the ears by the second mate he that hath
been to the spanish main and on the beach thereof
i have been with him and have been cast out of the
american consulate whither i had gone for food
on my ear and gone to the british and been be-
trayed by my accent and then sought a missionary
and been given the grubstake that my own govern-

ment had denied me what so cheap in the central
americas as the life of a yankee

  those among you that know the feel of a squee-
gee and a marines boot and the joy of smuggled
cigarets in the brig and no tables down for days
and a tompion lost in a seaway with the north at-
lantic coming in through the breech-block like a
shower-bath i have been with you and have pol-
ished brightwork and seen the world through a port-
hole and strained shellac through bread for the alco-
hol therein like the saltiest shell-back among you

  and last i was with those who went to war hos-
pital huit chevaux replacement camp mps ship-
wreck vin ordinaire submarines i knew them all
from mezy to montfaucon i went i and my com-
rades of the rock of the marne with our battle cry
of when do we eat on our lips two bites of the
dust i took one at mont st pere and one in the
argonne which last was near to being the death of
me and then at last i was cast away on fire island
with the northern pacific and beat a watery grave
by a pigs whisper

  so much for the past i have hung up my sword
and made my old tin derby into a flower-pot and
given myself in marriage and will henceforth live
in peace and so to my grave to which i expect to
go in a hearse and without boots it is in my mind
that this can not be fulfilled for it hath been said of
me that i was bom to be hanged

  now then greeting to my new comrades of the
camp-fire and to the many gallant gentlemen
and true adventurers that i have met upon the
road to whom these words may come greeting
may they read my efforts with a kindly and not too
critical an eye how-leonard h nason

comrade marino forgot to give his
own address so i couldnt get in touch
with his friend if the latter sees this will
he please tell me in just what way this
magazine is printing british propaganda
or will any one else who has discovered
british propaganda in our magazine write
me the details generalities on the subject
mean nothing except probably some one
with eyes larger than his brains or else some
one whos busily engaged himself in propa-
ganda on the other side give me concrete
detailed facts or dont bother to talk at all
also kindly give me your word that you
yourself are not a propagandist for either
side

  those who accuse us of anti-british prop-
aganda are given the same invitation im
very eager to find out whether this magazine
is pro or anti in this question so far i dont
know

  while were at it lets everybody send in
detailed charges as to the magazines being
pro or anti on all the other foreign nations
might put it to a general vote and then
well know just which nations were rooting
for or against the next step after that is
to get the secret service to work finding out

just how many millions of dollars are being
paid to subsidize us and then make us stop
taking money from both sides

	seriously ill venture that an appreciable
percentage of these propaganda-hounds on
various subjects are getting real money for
writing these letters of protest still seri-
ously ill plead guilty without hesitation
to friendliness toward our canadian neigh-
bors to the north if our country and the
british empire ever do go to war i-and
this magazine if im in charge-will do our
little best against them i hope there
never is such a war-nor a war between us
and any other nation and meanwhile i can
see no earthly reason for not being friendly
to the canadians with whom weve lived in
peace for over a hundred years

  yes in the magazine ive stood against
attempts to breed ill feeling between cana-
dians and us why not you who try to
breed trouble are the ones to justify your-
selves were at peace with canada why
should any one do other than wish to pre-
serve that peace

  as to the british empire in general its
done a lot of splendid things and a lot of
rotten things has splendid points and rotten
points so have most other countries in-
cluding ourselves i have no brief for or
against it lets judge other nations chiefly
by what they do and are from now on

  as to these people with their heads full of
charges of propaganda against our maga-
zine they make me sick if theyre such

- good americans theyd better put in

their time doing things for america instead
of talking against other countries if
theyre not good americans they are prop-
agandists for some other country and have
no business talking to americans at all

  if any misguided fanatics do send in
charges as facetiously urged above no such
generalities as such and-such a story is
anti-this or pro-that will get any consider-
ation get down to cold hard detailed
facts or dont talk if this magazine is being
made the unconscious tool of any propa-
ganda pll be might glad to learn about it
if its the conscious tool i dont know
about it if im a liar produce the facts

incidentally since this friend of
comrade marinos charges us with
british propaganda he wont object not
to charges but to questions about himself
he and his father are  americans

was his mother  american was his
father mother or any of his four grand-
parents born irish or german or
austrian or what is he himself an
irish sympathizer german sympathizer
or sympathizer with any other foreign
nation is he employed in or engaged in
any kind of anti-british propaganda if so
is he paid for it by whom how much
interested in any other kind of propaganda
religion what service rendered to ameri-
ca by his father by any other relation
if war service state whether through draft

  understand im making no charges
merely asking for facts in other words
what right has any one to slander and libel
this magazine with an untrue charge that is
damaging to it and for which he can be
haled into a court of law oh no im not
going to hale him into any court but im
tired of loose talk also is there any reason
why he should call me up on the carpet and
not come up on it himself

  propaganda-this country is rotten with
it all kinds im very little worried over
these unfounded charges against the maga-
zine but-how much propaganda is being
spread by those who bring the charges

  heres the letter be sure i have no irri-
tation against comrade marino he talked
facts talked straight-heard a charge of
propaganda and went frankly after the
truth thats good americanism i hope
he has also asked his friend for detailed
concrete support of his charges

new york city

   i tried to make a friend of mine interested in your
magazine some time ago and he told me that while
your stories may be very good he never became
a subscriber because your stories for the greater
part were nothing but thinly veiled british propa-
ganda he is  american as was his father
before him and he insists that should war break out
with great britain your magazine would be one of
the first to be suppressed

   i told him i would write you about it and he said
yes and suggested that i give you his address i am
not enclosing it but if you request it you can have

    the lay of the tropical tramp

weve tramped round the earth from twenty north
to twenty or more degrees south-

 weve lived in the gilded lobster halls

and weve lived from hand to mouth-

weve struck old london when flush with coin

and roamed through new yorks streets-

but weve always hit the tropical trail

when we find our bank rolls cease

weve drunk all drinks from pommery sec
to pulque and white label-

we have smoked dried grass and poros vile

or perfectos fine when able-

weve borne mosquitoes chigoes and fleas

screw worms have claimed attention-

malaria ague and yellow jack

and diseases that need no mention

but even though we parch and bake

theres joys to balance the scale-

a pair of dark eyes at every place

and good men along the trail

men with stories wild and strange

yarns that beat creation-

sweet-scented liars from every clime

drifts from every nation

tropical tramps tropical bums

tropical sour-doughs all-

we hit the pike on the tropical hike

 and expect to til we fall

through chapparal mesquite bamboo and palm
til the sunset of life doth fade-

well tramp till were lost neath the southern
cross

and get put to bed with a spade

of you have written him and i know that
he has so far as able answered every one
of you-no small piece of work and i dont
know how he gets time for it

i must begin by apologizing for the delay in an-
swering the scores of fellows who have taken such

 

a surprising interest in the whereabouts of the ark
of the covenant and the whole mystery connected
with it

  even now im writing at a disadvantage being
three thousand miles or so distant from my library
which is in storage so i cant even send a friend
very well to write down the titles and authors
names of the score or so of books that i have on the
subject

the names of three books that i can remember
are the coronation stone judahs sceptre
and josephs birthright the ten lost tribes
the name of the author of the second one is bishop
allen and  f the third is willis but there are a
great many more and they are all kept in stock by
my young friend a a beauchamp publisher 
boylston street boston mass who has been young
for half a century or so because he dares do what
delights him he even runs a magazine on the sub-
ject i guarantee him to be dead white and i dont
doubt he will send a list of everything on the subject
that he has for sale if requested to do so what he
knows about it compared to what i know is as in-
finity to a small dog barking however ill set
down as much as i remember without notes and
trust any of you who know any more about the
subject to correct misstatements

hphe english coronation stone in westminster
abbey is the stone on which jacob laid his head
at bethel when he had that famous dream which
some thinkers say explains the whole metaphysical
foundation of the universe and others say was
probably produced by dope myself like disraeli
am on the side of the angels

  in that stone there are still the iron rings which
moses caused to be fixed in it so that the men who
carried the ark and the other temple paraphernalia
could pass rods through the rings and handle it
easily it also has a crack in it which is asserted
not plausibly i think to confirm the story of one of
moses miracles

  i believe that the ark of the covenant is certainly
in ireland and that it will one day be found there at
or near mount tara i know the name of the man
who brought it along with jeremiah and the ark of
the covenant and the princess who was zedekiahs
oldest daughter to ireland by way of egypt from
jerusalem after jerusalem had been destroyed

hthese arc dangerous days in which to say how
much you believe and why its so easy to be
accused of opinions exactly opposite to your real
ones and anyhow this seems hardly the right place
for a metaphysical discussion science and super-
stition seem to be almost as confused as they ever
were what you kqow however is what you can
prove neither more nor less no mans opinion
or say-so is really proof of anything so in answer-
ing the question as to whether the ark of the cov-
enant if rediscovered would kill whoever touched it
i must be understood to be stating my own opinion
and nothing more

  i believe that it did kill any unauthorized person
who touched it in those days i believe it would
not kill anybody now although it could be made to
kill instantly if there were any one around who knew
as much as moses did for instance or as much as
the israelitish priests knew who inherited the
knowledge of moses and gradually let it dwindle
i

adventure

into superstition until it finally became mere legend
i suspect that men like edison and tesla hundreds
of others too of course have approached attain-
ment of a similar knowledge although they have
gone about it in a different way

  but i am a heretic no orthodox person agrees
with me turning on the light by pressing a button
looks like a miracle to me so does an oak growing
out of an acorn i have never ceased thinking
since a sikh once asked me if the creator is omni-
present where are you and if he knows every-
thing how much do you know to my mind
everything is miraculous or nothing is i really
dont care which end of the stick you hold to hit
back i know high tension wires will kill if touched
for ive seen it proved so im able to believe that
the ark of the covenant would kill if touched with-
out gloves and if any one had turned the juice on

there is a book in two volumes called the
great initiates written by a very intelligent
frenchman and ably translated into english which
is sold by brentano of fifth avenue new york
and throws more light on ancient miracles and the
men who made them than anything else i have
found it is rather an expensive book-six or more
dollars i think-but an awfully good moneys
worth i brought my copies west with me and lent
them to a pullman porter who seems to have con-
sidered them worth adopting and who is probably
the high priest of a new religion now

  as difficult a task as any i can think of is to keep
to one phase angle issue or point of this prodigious
subject for its as big as the bible as broad as the
universe lets try another look at it

a jew is an israelite but an israelite is not neces-
sarily a jew abraham was neither jew nor
israelite the jews are descendants of the tribe of
judah who was jacobs that is to say israels
fourth son the english-speaking nations together
with the scandinavian saxon bavarian and certain
others are descendants of the other so-called lost
ten tribes who were carried away into captivity
about  b c and settled in a country that came
to be known as scythia

  those ten tribes never did get along well vtli the
jews or judah-ites whom they despised and were
often at war with the ten tribes included the tribe
of dan the tribe of dan had several character-
istics one of which was that they were sea-farers
another that they liked to leave their name wher-
ever they went and a third that they were rather
more prone to piracy and raiding in general than
even any of the other rascals were who mrde up that
amazing group of mother-nations descended from
jacobs sons

hphe tribe of dan had established colonies in the
isles of the seas long before the invasion of
canaan by the assyrians the isles of the seas
were great britain and ireland they are repeat-
edly referred to in old testament writings the
tribe of dans long ships used to sail there regu-
larly so did the ships of the philistines who
established rival colonies worshiping baal and
naming such places as ballyshannon which is baal-
shannon after their horrible deity

  heremon is a hebrew-root word the heremon
who became king of ireland and married zedekiahs
daughter thus providing for the continuance of the

royal line of david in accordance with prophecy
was undoubtedly either an israelite or descended
from an israelite who emigrated in one of those long
ships

  when the assyrians carried off the ten tribes into
captivity they did not find them so easy to keep as
to capture they refused to stay put their route
across europe was blazed and has continued blazed
by that enterprising tribe of dan who left their
tribe name all over the place there are scores of
instances the rivers don dan daniester
daneever danube-denmark which is dan-
mark or the country of the danes or dans--place-
names such as danebrog they are easy to find on
the map taken in the aggregate and studied in the
light of the old testament they constitute evidence
which nothing much less turgid than pig-headed
scholasticism can obscure

the tribes of course intermingled but certain
of their characteristics have continued in
certain countries together with the most astonish-
ing coincidences such for exampleas the fact that
the arms of the united states are exactly those of the
tribe of manasseh england is the tribe of ephraim
the armof the king of england who is descended
from king david and who therefore actually is by
heritage a jew include the lion of the tribe of
judah and the harp of david they say the word
saxon means isaacson

  throughout the old testament the prophecy is
made repeatedly that the throne shall remain in
judah-that is to say in the keeping of the jews
it was also prophesied that there should never cease
to be a descendant of david on the throne of david
that leaves those who take the bible literally in an
awkward predicament unless they accept the
explanation that the stone under the coronation
chair in westminster abbey is the same on which
david was anointed king it is a fact that in every
generation since any sort of history was written
a king has been crowned on it it also is a fact that
the kings of england are anointed although doubt-
le s less oil is used nowadays than formerly

tut hang it i have only touched on the subject

    if youre interested in the fulfilment of prophecy
there are scores of books including reddings the
three churches which is very scarce and the same
authors mysteries unveiled

 as i said beauchamp conducts a magazine
devoted to that subject exclusively he calls it
the watchman of israel and the subscription price
is only a dollar a year or so there are authorities
who link up the great pyramid with all this and who
claim to interpret the peculiar pyramid marks as
corroborative of the old testament and the inside
history of the english-speaking people

to write the whole story in one volume would
be a task as great as wells history and at that
would leave the job just plowed up ready for the
next man

  i	would like nothing better than to handle it as
fiction and construct a story out of it but where
should a fellow begin and how go on and
wheres the end of it besides how many are there
who really care enough for adventure in the realm
of fact to stomach the ancient names and all the
bible references that would be essential

  to me the old testament is a library of gorgeous
the camp-fire



entertainment but i would hate to inflict my
views on it on an adventure audience without per-
mission and even if i had permission i rather
doubt that i possess the energy and skill required to
make an entertaining tale of that four-thousand-year-
long and ten-nations odyssey-talbotmundy

  a letter bearing on the death-dealing
powers of the ark of the covenant

new york city

  yesterday i met a hebrew scholar bom in
palestine and but one year in this country i related
the gist of mr mundys adventure letter to him and
he informed me that he had heard the same story
before leaving palestine he was inclined to
believe it

  i found the following in rev robert taylors
the devils pulpit

  we are told that the magnetic needle the
mariners compass was first discovered by the
venetian marco polo in the year  but the
priests of jupiter ammon carried the magnet with
them in a compass box as the ark of the covenant
of their god which it was death for the unsanctified
to look into-leon rains

  another letter advancing the theory that
history is exactly fulfilling the ancient
prophecies

omaha nebraska

  the enclosed is based on history and prophecy
and may interest camp-fire cut out any part
you do not like

  i notice they are filling the gaps in the pan-
american r r some  miles southeastward from
salvador were opened for business a few days ago
which ought to carry it as far as lake nicaragua or
thereabouts some  people were present at
the opening several years ago nicaragua wanted
to build south from managua to the costa rica
boundary but i dont know what if anything they
have done this would carry the southern terminal
to port limon c r about  miles west of colon
it is hard work to arouse our people to appreciate
the necessity of completing the line to buenos aires
andrio de janeiro-east of the andes at once or as
soon as possible to do so

i	was much interested in reading mr talbot

  mundys comment concerning the anglo-saxon

people he says somewhere about  b c the
ten tribes were carried off into captivity by tig-
lath-pileser king of assyria from whence they
migrated northward and spread all over europe
ushers chronology gives this date as  b c and

ii	kings xvii th says in the ninth year of
hoshea the king of assyria took samaria aiid
carried israel away into assyria and placed them in
halah and in babor by the river of gozan and in
the cities of the medes this was in the region
south of the caspian sea and east of the tigris
river northeast of babylon and northwest of the
persian gulf in the land of cuth or cuthah they
were replaced in samaria by men from babylon
hanath sepharraim avah and cuthah these
places are in some cases easily found on the ancient
maps

  the cuthah were the descendants of ham
through cush the father of nimrod the mighty

hunter the beginning of whose kingdom was
babel babylon erech aecad and calneh in the
land of shinar at a later date they evidently
migrated through southern arabia to africa and
settled in ethiopia abyssinia along the red sea
on the south of the other hamite colony of mizraim
in egypt in the reign of david they were known
as cushites and the cush was one of the mes-
sengers to the king announcing the deatli of
absalom the meaning of cush is black or
blacka-moor hence by striking off the prefix
blacka we may be able to identify them as the
modern moors in the land of morocco hence it is
easy to believe in the existence of an israelitish
colony among others in the british isles-england
scotland wales and ireland with travel and traffic
communications with phenicia egypt philistia and
israel by sea

as to the captivity of the ten tribes one of the
books of esdras says they left the land of their
captivity moving through arzareth or ararat-
armenia through the passes of the mountains
into a land where they were free to worship god
where they remained in large numbers in russia
and the caucasus as russia is or was known as
the land of the north and the land of the great
prince both jeremiah and zechariah predict they
are to return to the land of their fathers from the
land of the north daniel  speaks of michael
the great prince who announced himself as the
friend of the israelites and predicts their release
from captivity at the end of the great tribulation
now prevailing in russia the land of the north and
the land of the great prince under the empire
these people were designated as israelites and all of
them were registered or as daniel  says at
that time thy people shall be delivered from their
oppressions every one that shall be found written
in the book

  as to the return of the children of israel hosea
says they shall abide many days without a king and
without a prince and without a sacrifice and without
an image and without an aphod and without
teraphim and in the latter days shall seek the lord
their god and david their king and they shall be
gathered together and appoint themselves one head
-for great shall be the day of jezreel in the valley
of megiddo-modernized as armageddon

  in the sixth chapter the prophet states when the
restoration of israel is to be thus after two days
will he revive us in the third day he will raise us
up and we shall live in his sight taking the
biblical day as a thousand years this period will
cover three thousand years these years being
scriptural with  days to the year and 
years from some notable event in the history of
israel we find according to one chronologer that
david became king of israel and judah as one
kingdom in  b c deducting  years from
 leaves  scriptural years reduce this
to our calendar of j days per year we have-
x days days -  years

	months and some days or say about novem-
ber  a d when israel will begin as an or-
ganized government

another way to interpret this prophecy is to
consider  of the  years as past from
which deduct  b c the date of hosheas sur-
render leaves  scriptural years reduced as
io

adventure

follows x days days -f- 
 years-when the work of restoration began
according to the prophecy of our savior as to
the end of the times of the gentiles-when on
december   allenby entered jerusalem and
put an end to the oppressions of the turks the
times of the gentiles were symbolized by the seven
times jacob bowed down before esau gen 
a time consisting of the prophetic year of  years-
making x years these times were to
continue with israel subject to the gentiles they
began about  b c our time or about  b c
scriptural time when the king of egypt dethroned
the king of judah and carried him captive to
egypt and judah lost its independence making the
term of the times of the gentiles thus -
 a d this is verified by the  days
dan  which are  mohammedan years
reduced to our time the period is  years a
month and  days the mohammedan year 
expired october   leaving an overplus of
 days in november and  days in december to
complete the period of  days the moham-
medan era began in  a d to which add 
years one month and  days and the resulting
date is december   a d these three
prophecies are especially important as to the restor-
ation of israel

j n ben hur lew wallace refers to the ark
of the covenant as being shut up in a cave in
mount nebo and the entrance closed so none could
find it in one of the books of the maccabees
apocryphal the story is told at length with
jerenuah informed that the ark is to remain in its
hiding-place until israel is restored i am inclined
to believe mr mundy is in error when he speaks of
the extinction of the male line of david by the
murder of the sons of zedekiah david had a num-
ber of sons other than solomon among whom was
nathan the next oldest brother to solomon
nathan was not of the reigning line but his
descendants were of more than passing importance
when zechariah says    the family of the
house of david shall be set apart and the family of
the house of nathan shall be set apart as we
turn to the genealogy of our savior as given by
luke we find he was of the house of nathan the
son of david and jointly through zorobabel the
son of salathiel of the line of solomon as written
by matthew

as for the rulers of great britain descending
through the marriage of the daughter of zede-
kiah to king heremon of ireland through the
influence of jeremiah tradition says jeremiah died
in ireland but history says he was carried to egypt
by the jews after the destruction of jerusalem
where he was put to death as to the british being
the people of the covenant there is good ground
for such a belief in the parable of the wicked hus-
bandmen when our savior as he was teaching in
the temple said to the pharisees the chief priests
and the elders of the people the kingdom of god
shall be taken from you and given to a nation bring-
ing forth the fruits thereof

hphe mission of israel was to lead the world the
kingdom was given to them to place them above
all the nations of the earth they rejected it ulti-
mately it was given to the british empire whose

long career in spreading christianity and civilization
justifies this belief it shared this honor with the
united states when our great president uttered the
sublime precept the world must be made safe for
democracy which finally made three empires bite
the dust and pass into oblivion as accursed while
the devils of imperialism caesarism and fanaticism
were driven from the earth by the triumphant hosts
of republican liberty

  israel in its blindness rushed to calvary and was
ruined but in the regeneration math 
so near at hand this blindness will be removed and
as a nation it will rise again with a king or prince of
the house of david governing his people while the
son of man sitting in the throne of his glory at
jerusalem shall rule the world in liberty peace and
justice

   for out of zion shall come forth the laws and the
word of the lord from jerusalem-e f test

  i have a few pieces of kindling for the old but

of panama the chepo river in and around agua
dulce r de p the greatest adventure i ever had
was drowning in the panama canal and being pulled
out by a mr spillman of cheyenne wyoming my

to find out of any of its members can tell me billy

	i he rope trick a word from one of our
writers brigade on this interesting
stunt

san francisco

  ive justfinished the june th adventure which
contains mr w e bessons inquiry regardingethe
famous rope trick of the indian jugglers if a bit
of dope drawn from memory and not capable of sub-
stantiation at this time is admissable ill unburden
my chest of the account of my own encounter with
this yarn

come ten years ago i got hold of a book of travel
-one of mayne reids i think-in which was
a description of the trick as follows

  a fakir and a boy appeared in the streets of cal-
cutta  carrying a large covered basket when a
crowd had gathered the fakir produced from the
basket a rope and a big knife the rope he coiled
and heaved upward and one end went out of sight
and stayed while he held the bitter end in his
hand

  the boy at a signal from his master climbed the
rope hand-over-hand and disappeared a few mo-
ments later the fakir called for the boy to come
down but received no answer he called several
times and at last apparently irritated by the boys
silence placed the knife between his teeth and him-
self ascended the rope disappeared from above
the camp-fire	

came a blood-curdling yell then in rapid sequence
the severed arms legs head of the boy hurtled to
the ground followed finally by the hacked trunk
the fakir descended rapidly his knife dripping
blood he gathered together the pieces of the body
and placed them in the basket covering it again
after a mumbled incantation he opened the basket
and out stepped the boy unhurtl

  hats the account i read-and wondered over

    but a little later-in the same year-i came
upon a description of the trick in some magazine
it purported to be an expose of the trick

  an englishman who had heard of the feat who
was a dabbler in mesmerism and hypnotism waited
for a fakir to appear one came and the theater
was a street lined with blank walls-so that none
but the immediate assembly which was to a man
under the fakirs influence might see-and the
englishman with a camera found a hole in the wall
behind the fakir he took picture after picture and
when the fakir had finished and gone questioned
as many of the spectators as possible without ex-
ception these described the performance much as it
is described above but the pictures covering
every moment of the performance revealed only
the crowd gaping fixedly upward while the fakir
and his boy-assistant stood quietly by the basket on
the ground

  mesmerism of the spectators en masse was the
explanation advanced by the englishman he was
not susceptible to mesmeric influence he stated and
so was the only person to witness the performance
who saw just what he saw and not what the fakir
made him believe he saw

t wish i had the names of the book and maga-
zine from which the above are taken but
there was no reason at time of reading to think of this
point and i made no notes but id be willing to
take oath that ive given here the essence of the two
accounts they made a marked impression upon me
and my memory im told is inconveniently long

  whether or not the expose of the trick was au-
thentic i would like to learn perhaps both ac-
counts are mere travelers tales on a par with herod-
otus account of the crocodiles tears squien sabe
at any rate i know that some where in the books is
mention of this particular trick and what i saw
surely others of camp-fire saw also some of the
experts on mesmerism might also be able to say
whether or not such group-mesmerism is possible-

youll remember i asked you for
opinions as to the blurbs following
titles on our contents pages and in trail
ahead when we began cutting out even
more of the ballyhoo than formerly
quite a number of you responded and we
went over the vote carefully the
majority favored having the blurbs re-
stricted as now to a brief suggestion of
the general nature of the story but there
were many opinions all the way from the
majority opinion to a frank liking for para-
graphs of ballyhoo as to what good and

interesting stories they are the majority
too were for a bit of ballyhoo in trail
ahead through against it on the contents
pages all in all we believe weve now got
the form for both places that most of you
prefer any time you want it otherwise a
majority of opinion will get what you want

our camp-fire stations are spreading
steadily over the map but plenty of
room exists for more help make them grow

a station may be in any shop horrte or
other reputable place tne only require-
ments are that a station shall display the
regular station sign provide a box or drawer
for mail to be called for and preserve the
register book

  no responsibility for mai is assumed by anybody the
station merely uses ordinary care entries in register to be
confined to name or serial number route destination
permanent address and such other brief notes or remarks as
desired each station can impose its own limit on space to
be used registers become permanent property of station
signs remain property of this magazine so that if there is
due cause of complaint from members a station can be
discontinued by withdrawing sign

  a station bulletin board is strongly to be recommended
as almost necessary on it travelers can leave tips as to
conditions of trails etc resident members can post their
names and addresses such hospitality as they care to offer
calls for any travelers who are familiar with countries these
residents once knew calls for particular men if they happen
that way etc notices or tips about lecal facilities and con-
ditions letters to resident members can be posted on this
bulietin-board

  any one who wishes is a member of camp-fire and
therefore entitled to the above station privileges subject to
the keepers discretion those offering hospitality of any
kind do so on their own responsibility and at their own risk
and can therefore make any discriminations they see fit
traveling members will naturally be expected to remember
that they are merely guests and act accordingly

  keepers answer letters only if they wish for local
information write ask adventure 

   a station may offer only the required register and mail
facilities or enlarge its scope to any degree it pleases its
possibilities as headquarters for a local club or resident
camp-fire members are excellent

   the only connection between a station and this magazine
is that stated above and a keeper is in no other way re-
sponsible to this magazine nor representative of it

two-bladed knives

a wicked addition to anybodys arma-
ment looks like

  question-i note in ask adventure that you
kindly offer to give information in regard to antique
edged weapons and i am presuming to impose
upon your good nature

  i have a double-bladed weapon which was willed
to me by a friend i did not know that he owned it
and i have no idea where he got it

  it is  inches long the blades are  inch wide
at the broadest place both blades are thin and
sharp on both edges

  both sides of both blades are covered with in-
scriptions which are raised above the surface
evidently from the appearance of the metal the
background was etched away




adventure

  the surface of the steel was rusted when the
weapon came to me and from its appearance i do
not think it was ever highly polished

  the handle between the two blades is of a green-
ish-white bone the like of which i have never seen
before it is carefully finished but not highly
polished on each side of the handle is engraved
a row of circles with a dot in the center about one-
fourth of an inch in diameter

  the sheaths are evidently of rawhide of some
sort covered with what looks like cheetah skin-
tawny yellow fur with small black spots this
fur though evidently very old and much worn
has never been attacked by moths

  the blades look very old and are of primitive
workmanship though the lette-ng is bold and
free and drawn by no uncertain hand if you will
examine the black-lead tracing which i am enclosing
you will see that the inscription is the repetition of
one word over and over again i do not know the
language though it looks something like turkish
or possibly jagatai or even persian

  the surfacing of the blades is much like that of
a turkish boarding-cutlas now in my possession
which was presented to my father by gen grant

  i would much like tojknow your opinion on the
nationality of this weapon and the probable limiting
dates of its manufacture also the kind of fighting
it was used in and against what sort of weapon it
was used in defense

  ancient weapons interest me much if i know
something of their history and method of use in
offense and defense collecting them is a fine avoca-
tion in which i understand you are an adept

  i have a straight double-edged sword on one side
of which is engraved in fifteenth-century spanish
draw me not without cause and on the other
side sheath me not without honor do you
know if the engraving of mottoes was common on
spanish arms of that period have you ever seen
the above mottoes on a sword-blade and if so of
what country and period

  thank you much for any information you can
give on the above matters

  drop in and see me whenever you have nothing
better to do my office is near south station

  stamped self-addressed envelop enclosed-
allan v garratt boston mass

  answer by mr barker-as to the double-
bladed weapon you speak of i think it is in all
probability persian and its date may be any time
probably prior to  as to what kind of fighting
it was used in that is impossible for me to say with
any certainty

  demmin does not mention or give anillustration
of such a weapon nor do the illustrations of the
meyrick collection contain one one was sold at
auction in new york in  for  a sketch of
which i enclose no 

 it was there described as a two-bladed
reverse curved dagger with bone handle
in center one side engraved with hebrew characters
the other with arabian blades curved outward in
opposite directions each  inches long triangular
in shape scabbards of leather length  inches

  blades and scabbards seem to differ from yours

  the engraving of mottoes was common on span-
ish arms i have seen a spanish officers saber the
blade being solingen made by schimelbush 
foest on which is engraved in spanish-

draw me not without a reason nor sheath me
with dishonor

 i am enclosing a sketch no  of a short heavy
 spanish sword bearing date of  on the double-
 edged blade of which is in spanish-

 draw me not without reason nor sheath me
 with dishonor

see text for descriptions

  also a sketch no  of a very ancient spanish
sword with a very curious hilt made of solid silver
with places to fit the fingers it has a very broad
blade grooved on both sides on one side of which is
in spanish-

  draw me not without reason nor sheath me with
dishonor

  i shall certainly do myself the pleasure of dropping
in and seeing you and arrange to have you come out
to my house and see my few pieces

 ment editors and the exact field cov-
 ered by each section are given in

just floatin

wish i could slough this magazine
     job for six months and go along

  question-i want information on the following
points

  it is understood that the following questions
apply to boats without propelling force other than
oars or sweeps

  is the middle of september too late to leave
pittsburgh and float down to new orleans

  if so would it be advisable to start from st
louis

  what is the approximate time to float from pitts-
burgh to cairo floating days only

  same from st louis to new orleans

  is it safe to float nights with lights but with no
watch

  will current boards keep a floating boat in the
channel-edward french m d boston
mass

  answer by mr spears-you could leave pitts-
burgh in september and make the gulf by tripping
the ohio but id have my doubts about the ohio
river without a little power-an outboard motor
say there are long pools above the ohio river
dams and youd have to lock through about forty
of the dams which enable steamers to run in low-
water periods st louis would be better for then
ask adventure



you have the river current all the way down four
to seven miles an hour

  a days float would be about forty miles you
would be able to drop down about four days a week
on the average working down comfortably say
new orleans in about seven or eight weeks you
could jam through in less time i took all winter-
seven months-to make this trip down but i just
sauntered along went over to st francis river
for  miles and down chaffelli

  i shouldnt advise night floating without a watch
it is done by old river-men on a falling stage of the
river which keeps the boat in mid-stream a rising
stage throwing the boat to the bank you might
meet a fleet of tow barges and be rolled under them
which happens i floated nights when the day-
winds prevailed but kept watch its an eery
experience

  never heard of any one using current boards or
sea-anchors except that in winds shanty-boaters
in a hurry run into the drift and make fast and are
towed down this is dangerous if the driftwood is
swirling and the boat is caught in a squeeze

  im enclosing a slip thatll help you a little
come again if im needed

  if you dont want an answer enough to
enclose full return postage to carry it
you dont -want it

        stock-raising in australia
pine opportunities there still

  question-having seen your address in ask
adventure columns of adventure magazine as one
who answers queries regarding australia and its
resources i am taking the privilege of writing you

  i am interested in the stock industry in australia
have had ten years experience in ranch life in
north dakota and montana u s a i would like
to get in touch with some of the leading stockmen
of your country can furnish reference of any kind
regarding character and ability-john w pat-
terson fort mills philippine islands

  answer by mr goldie-stock-raising land in
australia is usually divided into first second and
third class grades as in all other new countries the
richer soil was the first to be occupied and worked to
advantage in many districts it proved that only
the first class would pay under the then existing cir-
cumstances but as conditions impuved second-
class country became as desirable as the first-class
hadoriginally been then the third-class came into
occupation and in turn proved profitable because it
was secured at low values and had been brought
within easy communication with markets

  in the most closely settled states such as victoria
and tasmania the greater extent of the land is held
under freehold and the newcomer who desires to
secure property will find it best to buy an improved
place or better still to purchase some good grazing-
land which is still subjectto considerable improve-
ment if he has moderate means the buyer can
make a fair profit on his capital while he continues
to increase the value of his holding

  well-fenced and watered sheep or cattle country
provided with a homestead may be bought in these
states at from  to  pounds per acre according to

its carrying capacity while properties in first-class
order and capable of grazing two sheep to the acre
cost considerably more usually these are compara-
tively small and a good deal of cultivation is carried
on by the holders it is on such places as these
however that a skilful stock-breeder may make
money and accumulate property

  like all good things the best of the grazing-
estates in tasmania and victoria must be paid for
but once established and with the right class f
stock in the paddocks the enterprising breeder from
the old country soon makes good on his purchase

  what can be accomplished on small sheep-
holdings has been demonstrated by the merino
sheep-breeders of midland tasmania here many
of the old famihes have carried on flocks of the
finest merino for many years they raise thousands
of stud sheep and send them to the mainland for sale

  the tasmanian sheep were introduced into hun-
dreds of the largest flocks in the other states and
sheep-breeding in australia owes much to the group
of accomplished breeders in the little island flocks
of one thousand to two thousand sheep kept up to
a high standard have been sufficient to maintain
their owners in the position of small pastoral kings
in other parts of the island splendid herds of cattle
have been reared and maintained on small holdings
and have kept prosperous families on the land

   in victoria there is still some leased country and
there are thousands of acres of grazing-land that
offer opportunities to the buyer who has pastoral
instincts and prefers stock-keeping to the more
arduous agricultural operations

  north from victoria on the murray river into
the southern pastoral districts of new south wales
a great extent of sheep country stretches away west
and east into the mountains which stand back from
the coast throughout this wonderful stretch of
pasturage there are great productive grazing-
properties which carry from one sheep to an acre to
three sheep to two acres the newcomer in his
search for land will find large estates varying in
value from  to  pounds per acre

  provided that he is in a position to finance the
purchase of land and stock he can not fail with good
management to make any of these properties pay
very handsomely there are also chances of secur-
ing land on lease from the government and others
of acquiring a partly improved portion of a large
run which is being cut up by the owners or subdi-
vided after resumption by the state

  the stock-breeder from older countries finds con-
ditions in australia almost completely the reverse
of those to which he has been accustomed all
animals live in the open air in this wonderful climate
the year round with the exception of certain stock
such as special studs working horses and perhaps
the house cows all the animals feed solely on the
sweet pastures of the country

  the newcomer wonders at what he considers to be
the insufficient steading about the country homes in
australia it is soon explained to him that no build-
ings are needed for housing animals in the winter
and this mainly accounts for the difference in the
size of a live-stock establishment in australia and
one in a cold country

   as a matter of course the working conditions also
differ to a considerable extent much less labor is
required to work the same number of cattle or sheep
and most of the work is in the open paddocks
a direct consequence of this is that one man can
i

adventure

attendto a large number of animals there are
yearly operations such as lamb-marking and shear-
ing and cattle-mustering and branding while in
between the animals are worked from paddock to
paddock according to the condition of the pas-
tures

  fats come on much more irregularly than in
a country where hand feeding is universal but stock
fatten very quickly on the rapid flushes of grass and
herbage which come in good seasons the animals
make amazing progress from birth to maturity
unless they get a very severe check the system is
thus almost as simple as that on the cattle ranches
of texas and the argentine

  most stock-owners in australia stock lightly be-
cause of the variations in the seasons as a rule
when the pastures are very good the broad acres
could carry many more animals than are grazed
upon them but the long-headed stockmen are
satisfied to keep them in good condition and con-
serve the grass for recurring periods of dry weather

  on his tours of inspection which are usually
necessary before he can settle down the land-seeker
acquires a great deal of knowledge of the country
which is essential to his career as a pastoralist he
soon learns to distinguish sheep from cattle country
and picks up many wrinkles on the management of
all classes of stock in australia information on the
value of water conservation is impressed upon him

  except in western australia where on extensive
pastoral areas scrub and small timber are necessary
to augment the carrying capacity of the country he
sees the advantage gained by killing the exhausting
green timber and cleaning up the surface of the land
as the dry timber falls the experienced australian
pastoralist will take him in hand on train and
motorcar journeys and freely impart to him the
tips he has gained in years of pioneering in the
country

  having at last made his selection and secured his
property which may be  or  acres in
extent according to his means his ambitions and
the class of country he prefers his first year will be
almost solely devoted to making decisions as to the
best means of working his place and of following such
operations as he can compass if he has purchased
an improved property he will learn how to use the
paddocks water supply and other improvements on
the best scheme for keeping his stock in condition
as a general rule he will discover that to make the
best of his holding he needs to complete theimprove-
ments

  starting on an improved place however the new
owner has a great advantage in being able to work his
stock to immediate profit he can devote most of
his time and his resources to the actual management
of his sheep or cattle and the place begins to produce
for him from the jump

  on the other hand if he begins on partially im-
proved property the principal improvement is likely
to be the killing of most of the timber and the erec-
tion of part of a ring fence he may secure a tank
or a well or two but on the other hand the place
may at first be-waterless so the new settler must
hustle into fencing tank or well sinking and the
erection of a house and some steading the princi-
pal advantage he has in this country over the man
who takes up virgin acres is that the native grass
and herbage are well established because the timber
has been killed in part and these respond to a mod-
erate rainfall with a lively growth of healthy feed

  therefore the place can be stocked up immedi-
ately and alambing and a clip of wool may be
expected in the first year of occupation

  the operations in making a home in subdividing
the holding securing a water supply breaking up
a paddock with a plow and raising wheat or oats or
hay and grain for his horses establishing a small
herd of milkers for the family supply of milk and
butter will be simple enough to an experienced
stockman coming from the old country as the
most urgent jobs are completed a vegetable garden
and a small orchard are added to the supplying
areas when the new man in australia reaches this
stage he is beginning to settle down to the comfort-
able life of a landed proprietor

  among the leading stock agents of this country
are dalgety  co ltd sydney the cooperative
wool and produce co ltd sydney the new
zealand loan and mercantile agency co ltd
with head offices in new zealand and branches all
over australia chisholm  co sydney cramsey

you require regarding your chances in this industry

     a hotel built on a gold-mine
 also some tips about bear-huhting and
 placer mining

  question-a couple of friends recently asked me
to write you for some information on hunting and
placer mining in western montana

  i spent a few weeks in the old virginia creek
diggings but know nothing of any place that seemed
to suit them what they want is to find out best
time for bear and also a good bear country-they
figure on usinga car to within fifty miles of hunting-
ground if possible and pack in from car can you
give any information as to such a place and de-
scription of country surrounding

  as to the place they want to know if you know
of any place in western montana where the country
hasnt been worked over too much enough so they
could work without feeling that older hands had
been in and got disgusted and quit any informa-
tion you can give on either subject will be appreci-
ated if this goes to adventure dont publish name
or address

  p s-both of these men are able to rough it to
the limit

  answer by mr davis-its a pretty hard propo-
sition to combine a bear-hunt with a placer-mining
proposition i am afraid the time is past when the
combination that will be productive of results is to
be found in the state

 the region between flathead lake and the
continental divide is reported to be a first-class bear
country a good way to reach it is to go to ovando
in powell county outfit there and hit the trail
northeasterly fifty or sixty-five miles

  bear are now coming out of winter quarters

  this was written april  
ask adventure



how do you contemplate hunting them some
trappers use bait and then trap them others use
dogs to find them and then take a chance with
a rifle if you are going to use neither dogs nor
bait the chance of bringing home the bear is consid-
erably reduced the bear may be around but you
are just as apt not to run on to them

  if you want the names of reliable guides write

c	a jakways state fish and game warden
helena montana horses can be rented at ovando

  i dont know of any place in western montana
where thet placer ground has not been worked over
i do not believe you will find any such place in the
u s you write enough so they could work
without feeling that older hands had been in and
got disgusted and quit the mere fact that older
hands have worked placer ground does not
necessarily indicate that all the gold has been
taken

  eight years ago a new hotel was constructed in
helena on main street which occupies the site of
last chance gulch where the placer miners worked
in the sixties and extracted something like -
 the contractor who excavated for the founda-
tion hauled the ground away washed it in sluice-
boxes and made a tidy sum of money it happened
that the old-time placer miners didnt work the
ground thoroughly there are large areas of so
called placer ground in various parts of western
montana which contain gold and which according
to report might be profitable if dredged on a large
scale

  years ago there was placer mining on nevada
creek powell county a few miles south of ovando
within recent years there have been some dredge
and hydraulic placer mining done on cedar creek
south of superior which is in sanders county
there is also some placer mining at the head of the
st joe river in idaho across the range from super-
ior there is conisderable placer mining ground
near libby lincoln county the most recent
placer proposition of which the writer has heard is
in park county near the yellowstone park

     more about the napo country
tts on the eastern slope of the andes in
ecuador one thing mr young omitted
to mention in his answer by the way is
that this territory or a good big chunk of it
is in dispute ecuador has it now but
suppose it is awarded to colombia or peru
then will the settlers titles be any good

  question-i read with interest a letter of yours
in a recent issue of adventure which fell into my
hands in moji japan in fact my interest was so
great that i wrote at once to the mr felton you
speak of at napo oriente ecuador requesting in-
formation

  i at present hold a masters certificate tonnage
and oceans unlimited and stand a small chance of
getting command in the near future

  but the sea game has been getting on my nerves
for the past few years and i have looked for a chance
to settle down and try to make a stake if the pros-
spects are as good in ecuador as they appear i
should like to go

  i have sufficient funds to take me south and to
provide a working capital upon arrival

   i have a fair knowledge of the spanish language
as it is spoken picked up on the coast of chile
i seem to be understood

   i have some knowledge of farming a relic of my
youth before the lure of the bounding main etc
snared me

  now my question is what are the prospects
as you see them if i did go what would i be able
to buy south what should i carry along to tell
you the truth what i want is a complete little book of
information if you can write it

   before i close i would say i am writing for inform-
ation i do not know if i shall leave the sea i may
but i am not certain perhaps if things look good
enough-who knows

   if this letter should be published i would request
that my name and address be withheld

  answer by mr young-i have read your letter
with interest quife a number of folks were inter-
ested in that ecuador country and i have received
letters from all parts of the u s and canada from
men who wish to try it a whirl capt helms
former president of the ajax tire co has already
gone and others have either gone or will go it looks
as if that counrty will soon be opened up unless
something happens

  the reason the chances have been so good is
the fact that there was a small empire over there
which was given over to primitive nature and a few
red men and a couple of white men these indians
are as tame as rabbits although several hundred
miles due south there are some bad indians jiveros
who are the other extreme there is some mighty
fine country over there and after a man once gets
across the mountains and down them a couple of
days he can sit and float for a matter of six hundred
miles in a canoe at the rate of a hundred miles per
day what stuff that is taken out of the country
usually goes in this manner and the indians pole
and paddle back up in about two weeks

   i have heard that there is a launch line or two
running up as far as napo from iquitos now with
one of these light-draft boats that has the propeller
housed up inside of the boat and draws the water up
by a vacuum created by a stand-pipe from which
the air has been pumped a man could go right on up
above napo with a good-sized boat i think the
name of the company making these boats is the
shallow draft boat corpn you can get their name
from the board of trade of the u s at washington

d	c they make a canal-boat that only draws
eight inches of water and at the motor show they
had a small launch running on a half-inch of water
two of their boats have been shipped to brazil for
use on shallow rivers the napo and cururay are
big rivers after you get down them for a day or two
but are not very large above napo and a similar
height on the cururay

  i dont know what effect it will have on the
indian labor if a number of americans should go
down there and make the demand more than the
supply these indians come in from the forest and
take up with white men and hang around for their
board and a tot of rum once a day darned queer
place over there and darned queer people hu-
mility is a part of their custom and they ask to be
whipped once a year with a switch for some wrong
they have committed civilization may spoil them
as it does every one else

   the average planter over there feels as if he isnt


adventure

doing much unless he has a few score of them around
him for my part i would be satisfied with a less
number and a few modern machines and a hydro-
electric plant in one of the streams

  there isnt much to tell about the country you
go to guayaquil and then to quito over the g  q
r r and ride a mule one day to papallacta from
there she is shanks mare stuff for about fifty-six

miles but she is a-winder of a trail and will take

you four or five days to make it the indians travel
slow and pack about a hundred pounds all the way
for  and board themselves

  their women follow them for the first day and
carry their coca grub for them

  after you get to the top of the mountain at bajeza
shes down-hill in a gradual slope for six hundred
miles and where the napo enters the amazon it is
only about nine hundred feet above sea-level
shes barren at the top and going down vegetation
gets thicker and thicker until she is typical tropical
jungle plus in the lowlands

  they dont have any winter only rain and im
here to tell the world that i prefer a tropical rainy
season to one of these new york winters with the
temperature changing every day the worst thing
about trying to go over there during the rainy sea-
son is that the trail is bad and the indians dont like
to pack over it but they do pack the mail at all
seasons

  near napo there is an american and down the
river there are a frenchman and a few white span-
ish settlers up to the present they have had this
vast country to themselves

   the g  q r r is figuring onjjbuilding a railroad
over there from riobamba and if capt helms has
his way he will put a trolley line across the mount-
ains for them i had lunch with him before he left
and he sure felt the call of the primitive he had on
a diamond ring with a stone in it the size of a
cherry but he was longing for overalls and a months
growth of beard on his face if you do go down
there and run across him tell him how for me

fishing stocked ponds

the more you preserve fish in order to
angle for em the wiser they get
brother thompson has doped out a way to
fool old dame instinct but my guess is that
the dodge wont work more than a few years
in any one pond

  question-would like to have your advice on
the best method and kind of baits to use for catching
old stock of bass in small lake or pond these
ponds were stocked say twelve or fifteen years ago
with bass for a few seasons they were very easy
to catch but for the last four or five years they have
been refusing to strike at either live bait or artificial
bait of almost every variety

  these fish can be seen late of an afternoon close
in to the shore but can not be persuaded to strike
at any lure-- walton ky

  answer by mr thompson-i have had the same
experience as you with stocked ponds but finally
got bass striking as fish grow up in a pond i
am sure they feel the vibration from a mans move-
ments on shore also the small fish that feed in
shoal water scare quickly at the presence of man

and somehow or other transmit this to the other
fish by their actions of getting into deep water

   i have studied this subject a great deal and finally
began wading i got to where i wanted to cast
and after getting in the water never made any
movement whatever for a long time i am sure
fish do not see you when you are waist deep in water
as they do when you are on shore i used the light-
est artificial lures with the grooved heads that i
could get they went deep on fast reeling and
brought out many a big fellow

  when using a fly rod often i had good results
from a bucktail and an  spinner the smallest size
i used many times with success the little fiy-rod
wooden plugs and one of the best methods is to
attach a dropper fly as usual and carry along the
little plug as trailer this looks like a minnow
chasing a fly and very few bass can resist it many
ponds like yours are fine for late evening and night
fishing the best killers are bass bugs with fly
rod and any surface minnow with it reel slowly
and you will have a fine thrill when they strike

fancy and fact in polynesia

theyre far apart when a man is with-
out capital especially when hes get-
ting along in years

  question-i am a workingman and filled up and
a little tired im  years old of this eternal work
work and slavery that seems to be the result of
civilization i want to begin a new life live every-
thing and go where a man may get a living and does
not have to worry for tomorrow all the time
south sea islands are the subjects of these questions

   do you believe that there is a chance for a man
that worked from south america to alaska for his
living to make it there as a native

  can a man get land there enough to live on
i do not want a plantation it would mean grinding
again

   what group of islands would you advise me to go
to to take a look for that home

   where can i get maps and literature on the south
sea islands

  how much capital would you think is needed to
get a start to live as a native not as a capitalist-
gus hamil ketchikan alaska

  answer by mr charles brown jr-you are
a workingman you say you are fed up with the
year-long grind and anxiety of modem civilization
your only escape lies in spreading sail for the warm
blue waters of polynesia you believe

   you see an island valley with a little grass house
hidden away in the green depths of the jungle all
about it are fruits and vegetables and flowers and
at the foot of the valley is a lagoon sparkling
through long hours of sun always it will yield you
the choicest sea-foods never never will it fail

   far up in the cool of the valley run wild chickens
and hogs and goats and cattle-yours all yours for
the killing you have but to call the happy laughing
islanders and they lead you to the hunt at dusk
ask adventure v



you return heavily laden to partake of the
kill

  then comes the moonlight orange-colored and
all-pervading and with it the laughter and the
singing of pretty brown island girls so that you for-
get almost entirely the loneliness and desolation of
the bleak land in which you were a prisoner of cir-
cumstances

  such is the picture your unhappy mind has
painted but oh my fellow creature out on the
beaches of polynesia life can be as cruel as a prohi-
bition officer especially to the man who in the
twilight of his years wants to turn native

  now mark when a happy reckless south sea
vagabond holding my own on breadfruit and fish
and sleeping out on the decks of becalmed island
schooners i met up with all manner of beach-comb-
ers men that had tired of civilization in much the
same manner as you have done this legion is
knocking about with but one regret ever they
curse the hour they turned their backs on the- home
of their fathers for an uncertain struggle under the
southern cross and always they whispered to me
their one hope spoke of the day when they would
drift back to the lands so far above the line oh
my friend the stories i could write of these breth-
ren of the beach

   i do not want you to become one of that legion
nor do i want to think of your plunging lower than
a native you must understand that to a native a
beach-comber or white man that has gone native is
less than the coral over which the island dogs run

   can you get enough land to live on yes if you
have money-several hundred dollars for in those
island valleys cash has now become a medium of
exchange even amongst the hospitable natives

  how much capital would you think is needed
to get a start to live as a native not as a capitalist
why when a man goes native he does so because
his purse is nothing more than a rag if he had
capital he would never turn to that life only
when his resources fail when he can not again get on
his two feet does he accept from the natives what-
ever they see fit to throw to him indeed i have
stripped the south sea of its glamour im cruel
am i not

  the enclosed form cash needed by all guests
on tahiti island tells more about the thing i am
driving at

   frederick obrien has written two very readable
books on french oceania white shadows in the
south seas and mystic isles of the south seas
are published by the century company new york
city

   i wish from all my heart i could mail you a differ-
 ent sort of a reply but you can readily under-
 stand one reason i conduct this section is to
 prevent men especially men who have crossed the
 shadow fine from becoming one of that homeless
 legion

  address your question direct to the ex-
pert in charge not to the magazine

             deux rivieres
jts hunting-country

  question-i beg to ask information as to the
country and kind of game found in the locality of
de riviere also give me your opinion of a 

remington rifle pump or automatic for moose
and red deer can this be beaten for above
game-guy u blackall blyth ont can

  answer by mr moore-deux rivires two
rivers eighteen miles or so east by south of mat-
towa on the main line of the c p r and north of
the c n r is a very good locality for red deer and
moose although from its close proximity to pem-
broke and countryside it is bound to be pretty well
hunted however as this section lies north of
algonquin park and the park serves as a feedei
of game for all the country that surrounds it the
deux rivieres part will always have a fair share of
game

  a better moose country is across the ottawa
from deux rivieres and north to lake kippewa
the country is rough rocky hilly with many little
swamps lakes etc there is considerable timber in
there and lumbering has been going for many
years other game such as fox wolves bear etc
are there but rapidly decreasing in numbers

  as regards the  caliber remington rifle for deer
and moose i have never used a  but i notice
the editor of guns and ammunition in rod and
gun in canada has this to say about a good moose
rifle i would suggest the  british the -
 winchester or remington the  remington
automatic or the  model  winchester for
moose in the same magazine adam moore
a new brunswick guide of twenty-five years stand-
ing has a word in praise of the  caliber for the
big fellows whether the  can be beaten or
not is not for me to say i know men who have
shot and killed moose with the  hi-power the 
ross sporting and they will swear by their favorites

  as regards a good deer rifle my favorite is a 
caliber ive seen great work done with ross and
savage

  hoping i have given you the information you
seek i will be pleased to hear from you at any time
and if i can do anything for you i will only be glad

other waterproofing recipes

ywo of em both simple enough too

  question-i take your name from adventure as
being the person to whom to write with reference to
camping etc i would appreciate it if you would
send me a good recipe for waterproofing a tent-
c sulling new york city

  answer by dr hathome-there are various
methods for waterproofing tents one of the best is
a preparation consisting of sugar of lead and alum
equal parts say about a pound of each to a gallon
or more of tepid water when dissolved put tent in
soak in the solution and when thoroughly saturated
hang up and dry this will make a tent fairly water-
proof mildew-proof and to a certain extent fireproof

  another way is to dissolve paraffin in gasoline
out of doors then paint the preparation on the can-
vas this will make a tent waterproof but is not so
easily applied and a tent is more likelyto catch fire
from sparks from a camp-fire

old songs that

                riverside drive new york

qne of the most interesting contributions to this
department since i took hold of it is a letter
from a dear old lady seventy-six years of age who
has sent in as fine a bit of swashbuckling sea doggerel
of a time long gone by as ever came my way
eleven verses in as clean-cut handwriting as you
fellows would want to see heres the letter and
the poem-they sure go together

              edgetts landing albert county
              new brunswick canada

am sending you an old song which may be called
a sea ditty-a doggerel affair in these days it was
composed about the time of happening  as
my father learned it in the year  when he went
to new york a lad of seventeen he used to sing
it along with others when i was a little girl until i
learned it from hearing him i am now an old wo-
man of seventy-six and probably the only one in the
world who knows this song wish i could send you
the tune as well-a quaint old come-all-ye lyric-
mss george essler

off with your hats every mothers son of ye to
the oldest and liveliest member of the camp-fire
does she belong well-i guess yes heres the
poem

the bold norwestmen

come all ye bold norwestmen who plow the rag-
    ing main--

attend unto this tragedy while i relate the same
tis of the lady wellington at anchor where she lay

off queen charlottes island northwest of
    amerikay

it was in the year one thousand seven hundred and
    ninety-one

great numbers of wild savages on board of our
    ship did come

and for to buy their furs of them our captain did
    begin

but mark what followed after before long time
    had been

       

twas aft upon our quarter deck two arms-chests
    there did stand

the keys had been left in them by our gunners
    careless hand

those savages they seized them and of them made a
    prize

oh lord we had no other arms for to defend
    our lives

twas aft upon our quarter deck our captain he did
    stand

with twenty of those wild savages their naked
    knives in hand

twenty of those wild savages their naked knives
    they drew

if he should flinch or budge an inch ready to run
     him through

our captain then perceiving this he unto them did
    say-

if you give back my keys again great sums to
    you ill pay-	

men have sung

 but the savages not fearing him they all drew
    forth their knives

 saying the ship shes ours now and you
    shall lose your lives

 our captain then perceiving this-the ship no
    longer ours-

 he called unto his sailors bold likewise his
    officers

 go down into my cabin boys some firearms youll
    find there

 see that they are well loaded mind that they
    dont miss fire

then down into his cabin we quickly did repair-

 but to our sad misfortune no firearms we found
    there

 except a brace of pistols two guns and one broad-
    sword-

 then instantly we did agree blow her up it
    was the word

then to acquaint our captain we quickly did repair

 and instantly he did agree blow her up into
    the air

 our powder was got ready our gun-rooms opened
    wide

 our souls committed to the lord our bodies to
    the tide

 those savages perceiving this they in our cabins
    rushed-

 our captain cried out follow them and after
    them we pushed

 ninety of these wild savages we killed upon the
    floor

 as many more we wounded and the rest jumped
    overboard

early on the next morning just by the break of day

 our captain called all hands on deck our anchor
    for to weigh

 with our cannon and small arms we on their town
    did play

 till they brought back those keys again which
    they had stole away

 now come all you bold norwestmen who plow the
    raging main-

 come listen to my tragedy while i conclude the
    same

 beware of all wild savages of them youll find no
    end

 and they will strive to take your life when you
    have been their friend

comrade edward e c gibbs of huntington
penna would like to be put on the track of a song
that used to be popular among the boatmen of the
great lakes about forty years ago bound away
in the twilight is its name and one of the verses
listens like this

we worked night and day till our fingers were sore
and we cursed escanaba and damned iron ore

russell jacobs a comrade adventurer who works
in a logging-camp out in bryant wisconsin writes
me that he hears a lot of different songs only half-
sung such as a few words of a chorus or a part of a
ask adventure



 verse here and there it gets on his nerves to listen
 to these uncompleted ballads and he asks me to
 find the missing portions

  russell old scout id feel more like going on a
hunt for this stuff if youd only put just one little
two-cent stamp in your letter for a reply it isnt
the two cents russell me boy-its the fact that
for every one man who thinks to enclose a stamped
and addressed envelope in his letter to me there are
four or five who either forget it or are too dumlazy
to do it and just bechune us it makes me plumb
weary hoffman tells me that i should just waste-
basket all letters of this kind

  well-annyhow-here are the titles of the songs
that jacobs wants california joe the wabash

the work is done this fall sing me a song
of the sweet sunny south and john henry the

his name in his letter from somewhere over on
staten island has also sent in a fine bit of deep-
sea verse entitled the dreadnaught which will
shortly appear a few more like these comrades

wilson and j m b and well have the makings of
an adventure anthology

eral adventurers who have sent in some mighty
interesting stuff recently i hope to use it all in the
