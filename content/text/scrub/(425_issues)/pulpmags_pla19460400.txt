engines of the gods

by gardner f fox

the engine was the wealth of mars with it kortha could save his
people  or the evil guantra could rule the universe but neither
could use the machine until its secret was solved - so they fought
and schemed for the knowledge and their planet lay on the brink

of destruction

kortha the smith brooded out over
the great red waste of desert men
said kortha was a genius men said
he was the biggest man on mars and
strong as an anthropoid ape but kortha
brooded because kortha was a coward

  he was not afraid for himself he was
afraid of himself

  he looked at his sun-bronzed hamlike
hands and shuddered glistening beads of
sweat appeared on his forehead with
those hands he had killed men and had
crippled his best friend for life

  behind him gleamed the red utta-bvck
smithy and his small shack and the tiny
structure he called his laboratory swing-
ing on his heel he went away from the
desert and into the smithy he made the
bellows leap and the red flames spurt from
the furnace with the tongs he lifted a
white-hot strip of metal and pounded on
it with a sledge that an ordinary man
would have found immovable

  in the clang and dance of hammer on
anvil he lost himself listened only to the
mad symphony of beaten metal instead of
the still small voices of his soul the din
of smitten steel jangling on the sootblacked
anvil was the music that helped the giant
forget his heart his eyes gleamed red
from the smarting flames and he peered
into their depths with green eyes wide and
angry as though he beheld a corner of some
lost hell

  he did not hear the muffled thunder of
the copter that swung in a circle above
his shack and swooped downward to dig
its tires into the yielding sands he did
not see the door open and who came out

   kortha said a voice like a song

  he started then looked up brows fur-
rowed his eyes opened a trifle in aston-
ishment

  ilse he whispered the hammer fell
from his grasp and bounced on the brick
floor

  the girl with the hair like spun flax
laughed softly and leaned against the
wooden door a white cloak clasped with
a fiery ruby draped her shoulders she
wore gauze trousers with broad leather belt
studded with jewels and a bolero of arket-
fur her white midriff was bare

  you ran away kortha she accused
her dark eyes gleaming like uncut sapphires
from the tanned oval of her face you
ran away from hurlgut when he needed
you it took me a long time to learn where
you had holed

  three years said kortha softly wip-
ing grimy hands on the white fur that
clasped his hard loins beneath the leathern
apron

  the girl ran her eyes over his massive
frame in approval saw shoulders a yard
wide and a chest and legs that were ridged
in muscles his long arms tanned by years
of exposure to a desert sun were those of
a king gorilla she had seen kortha snap
an iron chain with those arms had seen
him break a mans back and other things
well did ilse know the strength of kortha
and the fact that she carried a heatgun in
her cloak was mute evidence that she had
knowledge of his mad flare-hot temper

  ilse sighed you could rule the confed-
eracy if you would

  and own gems to garland your hair
and furs to swathe your body he said

  his green eyes belied his voice they
drank up the sight of ilse and her red
mouth and her platinum hair as a miser
drinks up the sight of his yellow gold

  you idiot she whispered you man-
killing tempestuous idiot zut forgive me
but i love you

	planet stories

she straightened faced him fully eyes

unwavering

  they sent me to you knowing that you
might kill another they-we need you
kortha hurlgut lies on his back unable
to move you put him there you and
those terrible arms of yours but hurlgut
forgave you long ago you know that
but you dont know-

  you dont know that guantra keeps him
there with green ftexra-mead and white
women to amuse him to make him forget
that he rules mars

  kortha started and his lips drew back
from his large white teeth like the snarl of
a hungry leopard deep in his corded
throat a curse rumbled

  guantra i remember him an evil
smell of a thing

  guantra aspires to power he has had
himself declared premier of the council
he wants to turn mars over to the victors
in the earth-venus war with himself as
sole power on mars he plays politics like
a master does guantra mars with its
rich ore-beds and mines-mars the prize
of a war that does not concern her under
a united mars she would take her place
among the planets beside earth and venus
as members of the council of the trinity
under the confederacy mars could have
done this once it was almost accepted
then-you ran away and the earthmen
and the venusians who feared your brains
and your body kortha-they revoked their
acceptance

  they had agreed i stayed that long
they refused to go through with it
they revoked their decision they said-
they said mars was a hotbed of trouble
that it had no competent ruler to make its
decisions and enforce them

  guantra said kortha bitterly wants
to be that ruler as premier he stands an
excellent chance of fulfilling his ambition
ilse came close to him touched his hands
with hers and clung her blue eyes stared
anxiously up to his green ones

  if you were to come back and be that
ruler she breathed kortha kortha
dont you see mars needs you

  kortha looked  past ilse out toward the
red desert far in the haze of distance
against the black and jagged mountains
of eternity there was something white that
shook and eddied in the heat waves rising

from the sands kortha knew it for for-
gotten yassa the city beyond recall a
dead city that ate up travelers that went
to it

  kortha sighed and looked at ilse al-
ways had kortha wanted to go to yassa
there was a mystery about yassa a mys-
tery that kortha meant to solve the time
was now come when he could

   give me time he said to ilse i need
time to think

  she looked at him and in the depths of
her blue eyes there was an infinite sadness
a yearning

  you lie kortha she whispered tears
in her eyes you do not ever intend to
return tell me why

  he looked down at her and smiled how
could he tell her the long uncut blonde
hair that hung to his naked brown shoul-
ders swayed a bit as he shook his head

   i will perhaps but not yet

  not yet you cannot tell her kortha it
is for her sake that you have buried your-
self alive but she would not understand
she is turning now and going away from
you perhaps forever

  kortha walked across the sands behind
her toward the copter once his great
hands went out hungrily then fell listlessly
at his sides ilse was not for him she was
part of his brooding the part that ached
and stabbed with loneliness ilse was what
made him a coward

   in the shadows of the flier the girl faced
him once again she stood perilously
close her eyes beseeching silently and the
fragrance of her hair and her curving body
steamed in his nostrils

  you are no hermit kortha you need
life you need a woman you need-me
he nodded staring at her face drinking
it in he did not ever intend to see ilse
again ilse whom he loved ilse of the fair
hair and the blue eyes and the body tanned
brown by sol

  kortha stepped back and his shadow fell
from hers he lifted a hand saying softly
goodbye

  with arms hanging to his thighs he
stood on the desert watching until the dot
that was the copter in the sky passed be-
yond the horizon wearily he swung about
and went back to his hut

  he yanked down a gigantic steel ham-
mer from the wall breaking the thong that
engines of the gods	

held it to its nail gripping the hammer
in his great hands he swung it around his
head once twice in a flashing circle of
blue-white light

   the walls crumpled when he hit them
the roof caved in and became the floor
scraps of brick and metal fell to dance on
the shuddering tiles fire leaped from the
forge caught hold and grew in a red
frenzy red and huge in its crimson heat
kortha battered and slammed his sledge
buckling even the wrought metalwork of
his dwelling this was his past here before
him sobbing he fought it and sobbing
watched as the fire came to consume it

   when the place lay black and smoulder-
 ing kortha lifted his head and looked with
 his green eyes across the desert to yassa

a rolling something on the red
sands caught his alert gaze he smiled
gently a tumblie probably xax who liked
him he watched it roll straight and fast
over the desert toward him

   nature had made a perfect gyroscope in
 a tumblie a round ball of sharp glistening
 spikes with a core of jelly that stayed level
 no matter how fast the powerful spikes ro-
 tated two long feelers like skeletal arms
 lay hidden in the spikes but could stretch
 beyond them to clutch food seeking to es-
 cape in the heart of the jelly was a strong
 brain

   xax stopped looking between his hard
 spikes at the blackened ruins

   you leave the desert kortha

   i go to yassa

   he felt the alarm of the tumblie and
 sighed as xax shrilled you go to death
 only the tumblies have ever entered yassa
 and-lived there is a part of yassa that
 even a tumblie cannot penetrate the white
 tower the temple of dead forgotten zut

   kortha hefted his big hammer and eyed
 its gleaming length

   kortha has never gone to yassa he
 whispered grimly

   it was not a boast it was a statement of
 fact a realization that there was only one
 kortha

   xax looked around him and saw the tire
 marks in the sand he sat silent looking
 up at the man who towered more than six
 feet above him

   someone was here xax said at last
 use wasnt it youve told me enough of

her the confederacy needs you doesnt
it  and you wont go

  i go to yassa

  mad mad

  not mad xax so sane that i go to the
one spot on mars where i might bring her
freedom and a place in the planetary sun
xax digested that squatting there

  at last he said you have not dwelt out
here three years for nothing you tried to
hide from yourself at first but you have
learned things here on the desert

  a pain tugged and tore at korthas heart
and his lips were bitter as they smiled

  you are clever xax smarter than
use

  use is a woman who loves you her love
is inclined to blind her

  kortha swung the hammer idly in his
hand eying the sunlight play across it he
took a stride toward yassa and another

  come xax he called it is easy to
talk and walk at the same time

  the tumblie rolled along beside him
they went out into the hot red sands their
shadows before them kortha fixed his eyes
on the white blot that was yassa and his
long legs lengthened their stride sand
crunched faintly under his sandalled feet
releasing tiny clouds of red dust at every
step

  eons ago mars was a cultured world
xax they had everything our ancestors
even you tumblies possessed your own civ-
ilization the ancients had power and wea-
pons long since forgotten by the clans that
descended from the survivors of the great
war

  wars are useless things but they must
be fought as long as there are men to quar-
rel who says otherwise is a fool but the
great war-ahh that was a war they
used things to fight with that we have long
ago lost and that earth and venus have
never known mars is older than either and
had more time to develop them our ances-
tors fought and destroyed men and ma-
chines and cities they left little among
the things they did not leave was the knowl-
edge of their arts and sciences mars had
to build again from scratch

  their shadows crept behind them as they
walked

  today mars is a weak confederacy of
clans ruled by a prince i crippled for life
guantra hopes to rule that confederacy


planet

stories

but guantra is a cautious man he would
never dare usurp the throne unless he were
sure of victory so sure of such a complete
victory that he need fear neither earth nor
venus

  there is only one thing that would make
guantra so confident

  a pool of clear blue water lay in a little
hollow ahead of them kortha put his palms
to the hard sand that packed its edge and
lowered himself to his belly immersing his
lips in the cold spring water bubbling from
hidden streams he drank deeply xax lay
to one side watching him

  with the backof his hand kortha wiped
his mouth his eyes on the blood red sun
dying in the desert a darker crimson on the
horizon

  well stay here for the night

  kortha lay down and locked his hands
behind his head his golden hair spilled in
a flood across the red sand xax rolled close
to him

  two hundred years ago said kortha
slowly the first earthmen set foot on
mars those first colonists settled among
us some of them married martian girls
one of them wedded my great-great-grand-
mother mixed blood flows in my veins i
am brood of earth and brood of mars
xax said you keep me in suspense
kortha what one thing is there that will
make guantra confident

  a weapon xax he needs a weapon i
think i know where he can find it but to
get back-

  they say that earth ancestor of mine
was a big man and strong he must have
been for it was he who whipped the clans
into semblance of order who established
the confederacy who placed hurlguts an-
cestor on the throne

  earth made mars rich in those early
days with demands for the metals of its
mines and the stellus-ore to power their
rocket ships earth was not strong enough
to conquer us then it extended friend-
ship and traded fortunately the confed-
eracy was ruled by wise men they used
their new riches to make the confederacy
strong too

  kortha sighed and watched pheibos roll
on upward into the vault of sky above him

  those early leaders left the confeder-
acy strong i madeit weak

  kortha rolled onto his stomach his head

buried in the crook of his naked forearm
he heard xax snort you were the great-
est of the lot

  i crippled hurlgut in a fit of rage i
left him prey to guantra kortha sighed
i ran away it has been bitter being out
here xax i had a long time to think i
hope my hermitdom has made me a wiser
man but i am afraid

  they were silent for long moments xax
stirred restlessly and the clicking of his
quills was like the rasping of many needles

  now guantra will rule mars said
kortha hoarsely he will get his weapon
unless i can stop him he will wait until
earth and venus are weakened by war
then he will attack them ilse thinks he
will turn mars over to them but that is
not so he wants to rule the trinity of
the three planets in the end he will pull
mars down for mars is not ripe to rule-
not yet not under guantra at any time
kortha closed his eyes whispering i
must stop guantra i must stop him with-
out seeming to do so for i cannot ever
again take my place in the confederacy i
am too dangerous

  xax said softly guantra has the army
and the air fleet under his banner you are
one man against a world

  i am kortha said the giant

  he rolled on his side and cuddled his
head in his elbow

  an instant later he was asleep

  xax squatted thinking

ii

five days later a giant of a man and
a round thing that rolled straight as a
warlance beside him clambered up the
sloping black rock side of the mountains
of eternity

  sunlight glinted from the smooth dark
stone that was polished bright as a mir-
ror by the myriad dust storms that swept
up from the desert year after year heat
shimmered all about them rising slowly
from the vast sand-bottom reflected back
from the igneous rock sweat wetted
the hairs on the mans chest and forearms
it dripped from his face in tiny streams

  kortha stood erect on a narrow footpath
and looked above him upward the trail
wound to dizzy heights set on a shelf of
massy ebon stone beyond him lay yassa
engines of toe gods



like a white bowl of cool water in a black
furnace

   onward they climbed and upward their
eyes fastened on the goal ahead of them

  they came together to the greenish
bronze gates that tilted off their hinges and
lay at grotesque angles down the street
that stretched behind the gates walked
kortha and with him swept the tumblie

   kortha stood still nostrils distended

   i smell danger

   eyes alert he walked on but now he
paced like the stalking cat and the muscles
in his long legs humped and swelled be-
neath the bronzed skin his hammer hung
loose in his hand but then the claws of
a tiger are often sheathed

   a shadow dropped from above swiftly

   kortha whirled side-stepping

   a huge king gorilla slammed an arm at
him and screeched in anger as the
smooth-skinned man eluded him the goril-
la gave his attention to alighting on the
hard stones and that was his mistake for
this smooth skin was on him like a charging
buffalo head lowered between his tremen-
dous shoulders and arms long as the goril-
las own shooting at him hitting hard like
pistons

  kortha was laughing harshly in his
throat as he hit he had not fought in
three years and the taste of a battle was
as old wine to his lips he needed this
test badly he wanted to learn if his re-
flexes were as they used to be kortha
balled a fist and drove it into the gorillas
ribs he hit again and again and some-
thing snapped

   blood flecked the wide distorted mouth
of the animal his tiny eyes glared be-
neath shaggy brows his dark brown coat
bristled

   the gorilla had got his balance by now
and kortha darted beneath a blow that
could have ripped his head off he swung
low then veered up sharply legs planted
apart arms pliant and big hands grasping
he caught the gorilla by a wrist whirled
taking the screaming animal on his back
he humped his hips and flung the beast
from him into the air but he kept tight
hold of its wrist and snapped downward
with all the fury of his titanic strength

   the gorilla hit the stones on its back it
screamed as its spine burst

  kortha stared down at the writhing

dying gorilla saying so this is the
secret of yassa the extinct king gorilla
is not extinct only an expedition in force
could completely explore yassa

  xax shrilled they dare not touch a
tumblie that is why we can come and go
he proved his point an instant later
when another gorilla dropped from a low
roof xax rolled beneath the falling beast
who screeched in agony as the tumblies
long quills ripped into the pads of his feet
chattering in pain the gorilla ran off
while kortha laughed

  youre a good companion to have at a
time like this xax he chuckled

  xax clicked his needles were coming
to the tower of zut a tumblie cant fight
what dwells in there

  kortha said no living thing dwells
there xax and the dead cannot harm
you

the glory that was yassa burst on
them as they rounded a corner and
stood in the square of zut a massive
building of translucent white jadestone
loomed solitary in the square the face
of the temple gleaming lucid in the sun-
light fronted toward them broad and tall
and tapering to a triangular crown far
above from its base four bulbous domes
stretched backward fanshaped like blunt-
ed and misshapen fingers the symmetry
of the building was awesome the ancient
architect who designed it had been an art-
ist as well as an engineer it was a thing
of beauty as well as a place of terror

  like a dark mouth set in the white face
of the windowless tower gloomed a gate of
shadows open to the square that yawn-
ing space was black with emptiness there
were no doors hung on hinges only that
sombre opening silently menacing

  kortha stood looking at it the wind
ruffled the white fur of his mantle it
stirred his amber hair and cooled the naked
skin of arms and shoulders

  he lifted his hammer and shook it in the
sunlight and grinned

  he walked forward

  xax spoke to him above the clicking of
his needles on the broken flagging of the
square are you walking into that thing
like a yamt to the trap 

  others have examined it before me
xax i have not heard that their examina-
	planet stories

tions saved them besides if the death
that lurks in the tower of zut still lives i
have no need to fear guantra

  they were quite close to the doorway
now and looking in they glimpsed some-
thing white and shining on the tiled floor
as they drew nearer the heaps of white
stuff grew plainer

  they were bones human bones what
was left of the skeletons of many men

  kortha lifted his head to survey the
doorway his green eyes blazed with chal-
lenge but their fire was controlled and
alert he saw the entrance plain and severe
in style affording no clue as to the manner
of its deadliness from the way in which
the walls shone so clearly translucent with
the hint of inner fires deep within them he
knew that the tower was built of transva-
line that rare building material whose se-
cret was lost with so many others during
the great war

   in the walls two tall faint strips of black
shone dully the doors of this queer adit

  kortha swung his hammer in his hand
and tossed it through the opening the
doors remained open and the bolt of force
that he half expected to sweep from some-
where at the hammer remained hidden

  he grunted to xax come on no
sense wasting time out here like dogs fret-
ting before a bears cave

   they passed the threshold together and
stood in a domed chamber circular in
shape with another doorway beyond and
opposite the entrance there were words
on the lintel above its arch

  science chamber whispered kortha
and started toward it

  behind them was a metallic whisper
susurrating in the stillness kortha whirled
and cursed and leaped the doors closed
before his shoulder struck their smooth
black surface he hit and bounced slight-
ly jarred kortha swore slowly fluently
looking at the doors

   how long will the air last  wondered
xax

   longer than our bellies will stand the
lack of food and drink so this is the
great tower of zut sliding doors that
imprison any who break a secret electri-
beam zut id thought better of the an-
cient ones this is really too simple find
the beam and send a current along it and
the doorsll open again

   kortha swung on his heel going down
the hall and into the science chamber
standing motionless on the threshold he
ran keen eyes into the huge chamber

  he chuckled he laughed head flung
back he roared hoarse laughter to the
trestled ceiling he sobbed his delight
hands spread over his muscled loins help-
less with his mirth

   xax clicked a question at him impatient

  its guantra said kortha when he
could the fool the utter fool and
he hopes to rule the trinity look for
yourself xax look at all these machines
spread out before your eyes the wealth
of a planet is spread out for you the
greatest weapons the solar system has
known are here and guantra has left
them all

  how do you know guantra has been
here 

   down there observe the blacker spaces
 against the grey dust inches thick on the
 floor something rested there for ages

 xax gone now oh guantra was here
all right probably with his entire science
staff they took two things away with
them probably the simplest machines of
the lot why did he leave the rest be-
cause the fools who man his science staff
didnt know what in the world all these
things are didnt know how to use them
didnt have the slightest idea of what they
are supposed to be zut its rich

  you may not know yourself chided
xax

   if i had the resources of a science staff
 id damn soon find out kortha grunted
 wiping moist eyes no wonder guantra
 can come to power-when mars has idiots
 for a population

he was bitter and savage thinking of
use and-himself

   men say you are a genius xax clicked
 its not fair comparing others to your-
 self

  bah snorted kortha a man makes
himself what he is but lets not bandy
words i have work to do

   he walked down the aisles of this treas-
 ure house of metal machines iiis quick
 green eyes studied condensers and gener-
 ators pausing to search the intricacy of
 bearings or the purpose of bizarre coup-
 lings inventions of forgotten ages lay
i
	planet

before him dim light shrouding dusty
cables and plasticite casings here were
bulbous globes and straight thin shanks of
steel there in shadowed niches rested wired
engines and bulbed machines silent and
mysterious

  guantra and his staff took the more
obvious machines perhaps the ones that
bore explanatory cards said kortha
walking softly in the dust these are
more complex

  he came to a halt before a queer tangle
of rings and wires and generator three
metal bands floated in air between two
looped magnetizers kortha rubbed at his
jaw thoughtfully scowling the pattern
of the machine was utterly new completely
strange to him yet there was about it a
faint air of familiarity the thing had no
obvious purpose it fired no missle it
had no in-take or out-let valves it-

  zut he whispered it only does one
thing it gives off vibrations

  xax merely looked at him kortha was
saying excitedly running hands over metal
sides and rounded knobs over cables and
rings but dont you see if a thing can
be made to give off the proper vibrations
it can affect matter it can cause a change
in the electronic structure of a substance
by speeding up or slowing down the rate of
electronic revolution around the atom

  remember the old legend about the beg-
gar who had a queer machine strapped to
his back everywhere he wandered he
met harshness and ill treatment until one
night a woodchopper took him into his hut
and fed and clothed him the woodchop-
per kept him with him until the beggar was
healthy again as a reward the beggar
turned everything in the hut into gold
pfah muttered xax a myth
myths are simply memories carried
down from generation to generation no
no xax where mankind has a myth there
is usually some truth behind it no matter
how distorted by time and innumerable re-
tellings it is the smoke that hints of the
fire i just wonder if this machine is the
one that began that particular myth
kortha squatted and ran exploring fin-
gers over wires and coils making positive
attachments and strengthening connections
he squinted up at the rings motionless
rigid in the air between the magnetizers
he grunted

stories

  must get its power from the air may-
be it feeds on oxygen or hydrogen or
argon hell im just guessing at this
point see if it works first then analyze
it

  he looked around for an object found
a loose panel of carven wood on a peri-
lously old table ripping off a section of
the wood he placed it before the machine
his fingers turned a knob

  a beam of shivering green light pulsed
from the coils and hung motionless to a
yard outward kortha kicked the block of
wood into the beam

  zut he breathed softly

  the wood changed grew red and warm
shimmering a brilliant crimson pulsating
as though from inner fires it became
opalescent almost fluid in scarlet brilliance
slowly the red became green and then yel-
low the bar hardened the liquidity of its
structure tensing into solidity

  kortha stared with wide eyes at the bar
whispering gold

  gold echoed xax awed

kortha grinned broadly hefting the
thing in his palm pure gold heavy
but somewhat soft xax i was right
blessed be the mythmaker for he shall help
us find truth

  it cant be true protested xax his
faceted eyes glued to the amber bar in the
giants hand you dont turn one thing
into another not by just a-a color

  of course not by a color that green
light was something that got down to rock
bottom affecting the very nature of the
wood whats so odd about it all mat-
ter is composed of electrons those elec-
trons move in certain orbits within the
atom if it is possible to alter the vibra-
tory rate of those electrons-why then
your substance itself is changed it is
something else in this case its gold
the voice interrupted him it came from
the outer chamber harshly gloating un-
relievedly triumphant

  it called kortha come where i can
see you kortha i want to talk to you
guantra whispered kortha and ran
he found the quartz-crystal televisi-
screen finally perched in a niche in the
hall where it could command a view of the
closed doors kortha went and stood be-
fore it he drew back his lips and spat
engines of the gods



the image of the man in the screen
recoiled slightly then thrust forward
again pushing the lean hawks face with
jutting black-bearded chin and hooked
nose and slightly bald forehead almost to
the limits of the screen the thin lips
twisted in a savage smile the dark eyes
glittered under thin brows

  i have you kortha at last i have
you where i want you i have searched
for a long time without success where
did you hide yourself  ah well-it makes
no difference you are to die kortha and
i-guantra-am to be your executioner

  did you suspect that i learned the se-
cret of yassa kortha if you did and i
think as much you are right it cost ten
mens lives but i learned it it was a
lethal ray that blasted whoever passed those
black doors we smashed it out of exist-
ence reluctantly it was a hellish thing
i would have given much to have saved it
but sighing it could not be done but
i found other articles to take its place
two of them assented kortha dryly
guantra seemed startled then nodded
two yes a lightning-blaster and a-
no ill not tell you the other that is my
secret  i see the lightning-blaster sur-
prises you

  another myth whispered xax look-
ing up at kortha

  myth puzzled guantra brows meet-
ing over its hooked nose oh you mean
the one concerning the weapons of the
great war the rhyme that goes-

they culled the lightnings from the sky
and summoned all who were to die-
a neat bit of doggerel but lets talk of
living men kortha i know you for my
enemy if you were my friend now-
guantra jerked suddenly drawing back
his lean face looked tense thoughtful his
thin lips drew down at the corners and
slowly curved into a smile it was not a
nice smile to see

  he whispered if you were my friend
kortha lifted his big hammer and showed
it to guantra

  talk no more of friendship between us
yavit he said clearly

  but guantra leaned forward and smiled
again his dark eyes were steady on the
big man in the white fur harness whose
sun-browned skin seemed like smooth
bronze against the bearskin

  zut love me but you will be my friend
kortha wait i am sending men for
you you cannot fight me for all mars is
at my beck my men will bring you to me
and i will make you my friend

  he flung back his head and laughed and
his mirth rang loud and harsh in wild
eerie peals listening to it kortha bared
his teeth in a soundless snarl and shook his
hammer and said i would sooner be
friends with a canalhound send your
men but theyll not find me ill be away
looking for the shortest route to your
throat

  guantra grinned ill forgive you that
when youre my friend kortha dont
think you can get free of the tower the
controls for those doors are under my
fingers a trusted guard watches the screen
here night and day he summons me
when any enter the tower he was quite
excited upon seeing you mars has not
forgotten kortha who reunited the clans

  how mars will worship a kortha come
to life mars will also worship guantra
who found you and gave you back to her
the crowds will go for you kortha the
genius kortha the man-gorilla kortha
the great

  and kortha will be-my friend

  it was then that the giant swung the mas-
sive hammer against the quartz-crystal
screen it shattered into fragments that
sounded like musical glass as they fell to
the floor

  kortha looked at xax and rested the
hammer by a sandalled foot his green
eyes glittered and his long yellow hair
shook as he moved abruptly turning on his
heel

  guantra has his weapon now he
needed that weapon before he dared de-
clare himself so a lightning-blaster
now when earth and venus learn that
mars is a power to be reckoned with they
will seek guantras favor each will hasten
to make peace and bid for his friendship
and guantra will sell mars for the highest
offer in a polite way of course

  if i cant stop him he will and
guantra has an army and an air fleet
kortha laughed harshly i have two
hands and a brain and a hate for guantra
maybe that will even up the odds come
xax stop talking to me

  xax shrilled a chuckle and rolled along
	planet

with the fur-clad giant back into the sci-
ence hall kortha worked with his deft
fingers examining coils and rings delving
into the secrets of ages-ancient generators
and condensors he grunted and swore
and his brow was furrowed in thought
one engine he completely dismantled but
could make nothing of its function others
he merely glanced at passing them by

  id need a laboratory to test them all
he said at last i just dont have the
equipment you cant determine uses or
strengths or purposes with your naked
fingertips

  he went and patted the ringed machine
with his palms

  we have no weapon but this xax it
will have to do

  that choked the tumblie thats
no weapon its just a-a luxury
kortha knelt and began fastening wheels
to the base of the machine he said in
our hands it will be a weapon it will have
to be for guantra is sending men and
ships to capture us when those doors
roll open his men are coming in for me
the wheels screeched as they bore the
weight of the big engine across the marble
floor korthas leg-muscles bunched and
writhed under the pressure he exerted his
naked arms bulged tightening under the
smooth skin up the ramp went the ma-
chine to grate to a halt opposite the en-
trance doors

  kortha lengthened the distance level of
the beam and wiped a forearm across his
wet brow he smiled mirthlessly let
them come now were ready for them
xax shrilled you said we could escape
by throwing a beam of light on the mech-
anism of the doors then why do we stay
here 

  guantra has sent men to overcome me
if we escape well be out in the open where
they can overcome us at will here we have
a chance they have to come in that door
ill have them all in front of me i have
to kill them all xax otherwise guantra
may learn where ive gone

  he may still find out the tumblie
grumbled

  i know its a chance i have to take

the drone of the fliers sounded sooner
than kortha had anticipated he could
imagine them circling above the ancient

stories

city swooping in to a landing in the square
a moment later he heard the drumming of
feet on stone

  the doors rolled open effortlessly
guantras guards came in yelling with guns
in their hands leaping for him shouting
loudly at sight of him

  kortha put a hand on a lever threw it
down

  a beam lanced out at the doorway  it
splashed its pale green color over the scar-
let tunics and naked legs of the guards

  the guards changed color

  they glittered yellow metallic one or
two of them were off balance they fell
with a ringing clangour on the marble floor

  xax gasped gold theyre all solid
gold statues

  i told you it was a weapon rasped
kortha shoving the machine in front of
him wheeling it toward the square

  there were a few guards left in front
of the fliers when they saw kortha they
came running one by one he picked them
off watched them fall harshly bouncing a
little on the cobblestones they did not
fire kortha realized guantra must have
been very explicit about wanting him taken
alive

  when he stood alone in the square
kortha lifted his hammer and brought it
down on the glistening orifact metal
danced and shattered under his blows cas-
ings split magnetizers fell apart bolts
and shards of metallic rings jangled on the
paving clattering and rolling among the
lichen-lifted flaggings

  guantra will never use that said
kortha grimly

  he walked toward the fliers one after
the other he smashed their radios and the
controls of every ship but one holding
open the door of the last plane he said to
xax get in

  where are we going

  to find use answered kortha settling
his big frame in the plasticine seat his
hands went forth to punch buttons and
twist dials the tubes behind him roared
their power shaking the entire ship he
taxied the flier across the square and
yanked back hard on the repellever the
nose went up sharply and riding the air
currents on blunt wings the flier rose above
the ruins of white yassa and aimed its
prow at the desert
engines of

  kortha slipped in the automatic control-
ler and ran fingers through his fur jacket

  ilse will know the politics ive missed
in living on the desert for three years she
will know if we can raise a force strong
enough to fight guantra well need men
and money and ships guantra has cor-
nered the market on those right now

  you wouldnt go to ilse before why
will you now

  three years ago i crippled a man xax
hurlgut who was my best friend it was
in a fit of rage i couldnt control my
temper and-i was afraid that some day
id do something like that to ilse i
couldnt afford to let that happen i love
her too much there was only one thing
to do since i couldnt master my own
emotions

  i ran away i came here across syrtis
major to the yassan desert because it is so
far from life nothing exists away out
here if hurlgut or ilse were to send
searching parties it would be like looking
for a sword out in the asteroid belt

  i picked a good spot all right it took
them three years to find me they wouldnt
have found me yet if i hadnt helped an
occasional unfortunate whod come to try
his luck at mining in the yassan sands

 mining puzzled xax in the
desert

  theres a lot of copper mixed into that
sand some day i hope to learn why
cliffs of metal abound on mars the cliffs
around ruuzol for instance but enough
of that let me explain about myself i
came to the desert and lived alone high
hopes were mine that the silence and lone-
liness and my work would teach me con-
trol i dont know how well i succeeded
in that but in another thing i did have
success

  on the long winter nights i saw lights
in yassa xax man-made lights elec-
tritorches and solar-beams now everyone
on mars knows that yassa is a deserted
city and deadly lights didnt belong there

i wanted to go to yassa to see who walked
its dead streets but as a test i curbed
myself fought my yearning i mastered
it i wondered and puzzled but i stayed
on the desert some day i would go but
not yet finally the lights went away and
did not return

  i know now that those lights were car-

the gods	

ried by guantras science staff who discov-
ered the secret of the tower of zut and
used it they took away the weapons they
could use and left the others thinking no
one could fathom their use they thought
me dead bah the fools

  then when ilse came for me i realized
the truth guantra had sent men to yassa
but if i went to yassa i might prevent
their taking anything of value from the
city i was too late

  xax shuddered at the glitter in the green
eyes of this big giant

  i did not think guantra had taken any-
thing i know better now without a
weapon guantra would not dare strike for
power by smashing every weapon in that
tower i could have stopped him cold at
one stroke then i could have returned
to my smithy in the desert and lived out
my life

kortha sighed and surveyed the
craggy ground below they were fly-
ing low over a barren plain where rocks lay
yellow in the sun as far as they could see
like golden pebbles jagged red cliffs rose
off to the right shining dull like copper
to the left a mesa of red-green stone lifted
a flat top toward the sky between the
mesa and the cliffs the golden floor of the
plain went on and on endlessly

  kortha increased the speed of the little
flier and sighed but now all that is
changed guantra has his weapon and i
must find ilse we must raise a fleet to
oppose him im still afraid of myself
xax i may yet hurt ilse but ill have to
chance it mars is bigger than both of us

  a dot in the sky to sunward of them
grew bigger loomed into a small flier kor-
tha swore happily seeing the emblazoned
dragon on its prow

  ilse shes come back to talk to me
again

  he swung the ship toward her anathe-
matizing himself for having smashed its
radio he had meant it as a protective
measure to prevent guantra from triangu-
lating his position it boomeranged now
ilse would see guantras rippled black star
pennon on his own prow

  she fled from him like a startled fawn
but guantra built good ships kortha over-
hauled her slowly ducking her gun-blasts
swallow-darting when she dove for a


planet

stories

cliffside kortha followed and only expert
piloting prevented them both from slam-
ming the hulls of their ships against those
coppery walls

  a shell from her rear electrogun ripped
away a section of his fuselage before she
saw him big and white-furred in the glass
cabin he saw her face go white looking
back at him ilse fought her controls
dropping toward the plain grinning wryly
fighting his ship that bucked with a hole in
her side kortha followed her down

  she came running to him across the
stones her loose white bolero jacket blow-
ing back her straight long legs flashing
brown in the sunlight making shadowy gro-
tesques ahead of her on the jagged rocks
her red mouth shouted laughter at him
mixed with sobs

  he caught her up against him bent to
memorize her blue eyes the soft cheeks that
were moist with tears the full scarlet
mouth her platinum hair blew wild in
the breeze

  kortha drank a kiss from her wet mouth
and kept her crushed to him for moment
after moment three years on the desert
is a long time

  whew whispered ilse laughing up
at him with lips and eyes her nose crink-
ling a little

  she sobered suddenly put soft hands to
his cheeks stroking them

  you fly guantras ship what hap-
pened 

  he told her looking down into her eyes
moving his gaze from hair to lips to cheeks
and throat she shuddered listening and
he held her tighter

  its no use kortha she said at last
we cant fight the fleet that guantra can
muster the fact that he has those weap-
ons makes a lot of difference i knew
when i came for you that we were nearly
beaten you were our only hope if
kortha could come back from the grave-
there would be a psychological value to the
thing we might aim at strikes at seduc-
ing men from guantras navy build ships
on the sly from mare cimmerium to sinus
gomer but now-

  her shoulders drooped kortha scowled
across at the red cliff crimson in the sun-
light it was true the fleet that guantra
owned was the fleet that kortha had built
battleship and air-cruiser he had blue-

printed their models seen them swung into
their launching-cradles he had manned
it with picked men nothing on mars
could match it certainly possibly nothing
on earth or venus either with the excep-
tion of their vast space fleets he sighed

  xax shrilled a warning clicking his
needles

  from the south a huge grey battleflier
rose grim and massive above the flat mesa
sunlight disclosed its rippled black star
pennon and the gleaming guns and the
swarms of fighters covering its decks tow-
ering masts brooded down across the
plains giving the ship an aetherial look
that its dark bulk belied

  kortha laughed bitterly what use to
talk of fleets now thats guantras own
flagship hes come in person for me
now by some black magic hes learned
of what took place at yassa probably
took alarm when his radio calls went un-
answered

  they ran across the stones for the small
cruiser kicking pebbles into life making
them roll and bounce with big hands
kortha tossed ilse into the open door of
the flier swept in after her with a hard
swift leap the door clanged behind them

the ship shuddered under a direct hit
on her rear rockets kortha went flying
clutching at ilse dragging her down on
him his back met the far wall and he
cushioned her against his chest

  kortha was on his feet eyes blazing
his hand went to his hammer hefting it
lifting it up and down very slowly he
snarled a little deep in his throat

  he knows were here hes playing
with us he wants us alive

theres my plane if we hurry-
across the stone-bottom they saw the
silvered hull of the little flier cave inward
metal sides slivered and splinters flew
through the air

  guantra has good gunners said kor-
tha drily lets learn if his combat units
are as good

  he drove the massy head of his hammer
against the door breaking it open with
ilse in one arm he dropped to the rocks
and walked away from the flier side by
side they stood and looked up at the gi-
gantic ship that hovered yards above the
plains men came swarming over its sides
engines of the gods	

dropping like ants from ropes leaping to-
ward them

  kortha saw they were unarmed he
tossed his hammer aside and grinned merci-
lessly lips writhing back from strong white
teeth

  use looked up at him and shuddered
she had seen kortha fight before

  he sprang to meet them hamlike fists
balled into twin maces he broke a mans
jaw with his first blow with his second
he snapped three ribs of an officer in a
short green cloak he hit again and again
and everytime that his fists struck bones
cracked or splintered men shrieked there
on the stones trying to stand up to him

  occasionally he unclasped his hands to
grasp and when his grip fell clutching the
victim dropped with shredded limbs

  they were all around him now grunting
under his blows screaming when he
wrenched kortha danced like a temple
harlot twisting on his toes slamming his
long arms out dropping his fists where they
hurt the most on jaw on belly on ribs
he laughed harshly as he fought his eyes
flared and his nostrils quivered the soft
thudding of fists on flesh and the sobs of
air-hungry lungs orchestrated the battle

  it looked as though he would beat them
all for a moment his great form was
untouched and men lay sprawled on the
rocks all around him

  then someone flung sand from a pouch
kortha knew its bitter burn as it bit into
his eyes they welled with tears but
kortha held them open fighting the smart
with all the surging energy of his will to
close them would make him helpless yet
the tears blinded him too and those he
could not help

  the guards raged into him goaded to
desperation hitting hard buffeted blinded
swept off his feet kortha was hurled back-
ward onto the stones for long minutes
he was the core of a shifting sobbing mad-
dened group a hand dug at his face
shoving it into sharp rocks

  kortha arched his loins thrusting hard
upwards heaving men off he came to his
feet blind striking out shouting as he felt
flesh pulp beneath his fists

  something slammed across his temple
bouncing off

  kortha pitched face downward hearing
use screaming

ill

ortha floated in clouds bodiless
fragrance drifted past in tendrils
of white mist curling and crawling with
scented life through the mist came a
battleship with guantra seated on it laugh-
ing at him a silken garment dyed with
scarlet and magenta flickered past obscur-
ing guantra wrapped in the silk was
use dancing for him trailing a cape of
moonlight behind her white shoulders
above the multicolored scarves the clouds
shifted beneath him causing him to fall
he dropped faster and faster

  golden men caught him carried him on
their shoulders they led him to a wall
and chained his wrist to a red-hot man-
acle-

  it was use who held his wrist in her
hand ilse bending above him crystal tears
quivering on her long amber lashes

  kortha thank zut youve lain so
still

  he was in a bed he grunted as he sat
up use fought him tried to force him
down saying the doctor said you had the
constitution of a desert boar what you
went through would have killed ten ordi-
nary men but lie still lie still the wards
are filled with the men youve wrecked-

  she laughed and sobbed fighting him
but kortha put her aside easily asking
where is he where is the smell

  i am here kortha said guantra from
the doorway where he stood a gun steady
in his hand

  the gun was aimed at use kortha was
a little too far away to jump but the mus-
cles on his legs and arms writhed like
snakes with the fury that pounded in his
blood 

  guantra was saying stand away from
him use a bullet wont stop kortha
but he wont risk your chances with hot
lead

  what do you want of me  snarled the
giant mastering his red rage fingers open-
ing and closing

  you will be my friend kortha that
is all i seek of you just your friendship

  use gasped in her throat and whirled
around blue eyes wide she stood rigid
bent a little forward she choked no
no guantra you wouldnt-not to kor-
tha not that
	planet

  not what rasped kortha scowling
in puzzlement

  the blue grotto  it changes men it
makes them different they arent the
same after they come out of there

  kortha stared at ilse noting the wide
ashen eyelashes the red mouth twisted in
pain the white forehead riven with fur-
rows torture so it was what he had
expected of guantra to torture a man un-
til he became a broken thing begging for
friendship suddenly he looked at guantra
and found the man lost in admiration of
ilses tanned loveliness

  kortha leaped like an uncoiling spring
he caught guantra about the waist and
flipped him across a thigh sending him in-
to a wall the premier thudded into the
oak and steel hitting hard he crouched
for long moments on hands and knees
shaking his head then he crawled to his
feet and looked into his own gun held in
korthas hand

  youll let ilse and xax go guantra
i remain

  guantra rubbed his hip smiling grimly
he nodded

  gladly kortha it will be guarantee
of our future friendship

  no sobbed ilse long fingernails biting
into korthas hairy forearm hell change
you hell do to you what he did to those
-others

  kortha shook her off torture he hated
but he could stand up to it but if they
did anything to ilse-he wasnt that sure of
himself he had to get rid of her send
her away to hurlgut maybe they could
somehow contact earth or venus get help

  ilse hit his furred chest with tiny fists
whimpering

  idiot cant you see guantra will
make you his friend youll do what he
says youll be a figurehead all the
confederacy will hail the union of guantra
and kortha it wont know that only
guantra gives the orders that youre just a
puppet

  kortha shoved her away

  get moving he snapped ill hold
off guantra until youre safely gone

  ilse fought and raged but she was help-
less with her bare arm in one of korthas
hands she went sideways in front of him
as he pushed her her red mouth whim-
pered

stories

  kortha stood and watched the fleet little
scout ship fade into the south when it
had disappeared he waited for minutes
calculting ilses speed against possibility of
pursuit satisfied he handed his gun to
guantra

  he growled bring on your torturers
guantra lets get this over with

  but guantra laughed softly sheathing
the gun

  torture oh no thats a bit-ah-
antiquated isnt it besides i know men
kortha torture would never make me
your friend

  not torture

  come with me into my stateroom oh
be my enemy if you will but youll be
needing food and a bit of sharasta wine
i have both

kortha realized that if he leaped on
guantra now he could break his neck
or snap his spine but there would be
other guantras better to fight this one
than the others who might arise he smiled
to himself apparently those years in the
desert had aided him to control his mad
temper in olden days he would have been
on guantra slaying without thought to a
possible future

  he shrugged broad shoulders aware that
his stomach was empty there was no
need to starve to death he had done a lot
without food he walked after guantra
slowly thoughtful

  a dull black plasticine screen formed one
wall of the hexagonal stateroom before
it a curved desk glittered dully littered
with charts and papers chrystolite chairs
and benches gleamed in myriad colors over
the thickly woven black rug kortha stared
around him nodding he remembered the
ship it was one he had himself planned

  but the screen was new he stood in
front of it frowning guantra came to his
side gesturing

  since you turned hermit things have
happened on mars kortha this screen is
a by-product of researches by my science
division with it i can detect scenes at
certain distances in the open air essen-
tially the same as television we can focus
an unlimited field by using cosmic ray am-
plifiers

  guantra went to the wall pressed a but-
ton
engines of

the gods



  we use radio waves though through-
out the ship in order to prepare our food
kortha looked through the transparent
shield in the wall saw a frozen steak thaw
suddenly cook before his eyes in a matter
of seconds

  high frequency waves kortha said
thats old

  true but ive found it saves time to
install them in every room in time of
battle my men need not desert their posts
for food the food is there frozen needs
only six to eight seconds to cook and be
taken out ready to eat

  a steward came and lifted out the steak
setting it on a table before kortha he
served chilled sharasta wine and freshly
baked bread chilled sugar sauce over bit-
ter fruits brought a hard grin to the giants
mouth he had not realized before just
how hungry he was

  he began to eat

  when he was done he went and stood at
guantras side in front of the starboard
windows outside sunlight blazed on the
quartz-veined cliffs over which the vara-
dium was passing hollow depressions
glittered as though filled with sparkling
gems while huge stalagmites lifted jagged
edges shot forth scintillating hues that
etched color madness on the dun cliffsides

  the sheer cliffs fell away exposing a
massive gap in the mighty mountains the
varadium poked its dull grey nose down-
ward and sank between the ledges

  staring from the darkened starboard
windows kortha beheld the iridescent
gleam of the mountain-walls turn to yellow
and red and green the colors deepened
as the ship lowered on the air currents
grew lavendar then purple shadows from
the tall cliffsides gave the canyon into
which they sank a dark sombreness

  the blue grotto is far below the sur-
face whispered guantra a young lieu-
tenant discovered and told me about it
i checked his findings had my engineers
pay it a visit their work resulted in
something that will make your eyes shine
with her keel scraping dry red sand
the varadium edged along the bed of the
canyon ahead lay a great black orifice
in the side of the cliff a gigantic cave
vast as mars mightiest hangar even
by straining his keen eyes kortha could

-planet stories-spring

make out nothing beyond that ebon dark-
ness

  but when the flier poked its prow into
the cave a battery of tremendous mercury
floodlamps leaped to bluish-white life
blinking in their glare kortha looked down
at the floor of the cave found it fitted with
great steel cradle with benches and lathes
and tools the battleflier sank into the
cradle with a lurch and a swift righting
of its bulk springs sighed softly under
its weight cushioning it on a blanket of
compressed air

  guantra led kortha from the stateroom
out along the grey deck toward the gang-
plank saying this place has been use-
ful to me extremely so ive found that
it paid to spend the money to equip it

  kortha looked around him gauging his
chances for fight men stepped to benches
swung down ladders with an air of deft
sureness they paid him the insult of
inattention his hands knotted then re-
laxed suppose he did fight it would
do him no good even kortha could not
overcome the entire crew of a battleflier
not without a weapon

  guantra motioned him to a tiny mono-
rail car

  the journey is not far but we must
avoid some-ah-rather terrifying preci-
pices in this the rail cost fifty lives to
install a misstep above an abyss-

  he shrugged pressing buttons the car
lurched forward gathered speed

  personally i think some of them are
bottomless we could take no soundings

  they caught glimpses of black depths
to their left as the car slid along on its
ribbonlike rail a string of lights fas-
tened to the cliff cast eerie shadows into
the gulf the car slowed to round a
curve

  it halted in a chamber whose walls were
sculped with vividly stained statuary
their colors were faded now but here and
there were spots of red sunset or blue
ocean or the white of a ships sail

  kortha muffled a curse of surprise in
his throat

  i thought youd like it guantra
laughed that lieutenant of mine found
it he swears its a lost museum of some
very early martian race the ones who
lorded it when there were oceans on the
planet
	planet

kortha did not fight the drag of
curiosity he walked along the wall
intent on the friezes here were the tall-
prowed water-ships sails bellying before
the wind cleaving foaming blue-green
ocean he saw men in mail and helmets
battling on green grass there were
boudoir scenes too with tall and lovely
blonde women reclining on soft cushions
fanned by strangely shaped slaves

  how had this forgotten clue to a past
civilization come to be buried under tons
of mountains perhaps a planetary catas-
trophe in the past had shifted an entire
mountain-range to bury a city beneath
its rock foundations then again the old
ones might have carved out niches in the
stone itself hollowing chambers the better
to preserve traces of their culture

  kortha hastened his steps found guan-
tra waiting for him in a room hung com-
pletely with expensive blue-and-gold
draperies even the ceiling was muffled
in bands of rich silk the floor was a
thick fur rug that would have cost a mil-
lion kofuls on the open market and in
the mathematical center of the room was
a couch of incredible softness draped with
a spotted black-and-silver ocemar pelt

  lie down and rest kortha i shall
leave you to your thoughts

  kortha came up swiftly in front of
guantra and grasped him by his arms
above the elbows he swung the premier
off his feet held him inches above the
ground glaring at him

  i could kill you guantra i could snap
your spine as a king gorilla could a twig
you would die

  guantra paled and licked him lips then
he managed to laugh

  no need for that all i ask is that
you spend the night here in this room
sleeping on that couch after that you
are free to leave

  kortha dropped the man in his bewil-
derment saying is that all  is the place
haunted ought i start at ghosts or
do you gas the lungs out of me

  neither just stay here no harm
will come to you

  kortha grinned and surveyed the drapes
he ran fingers through his thick yellow
hair he chuckled ill stay in the
morning ill leave

  he watched guantra close the door be-

storses

hind him he heard the bolt snick into
place he went and sank on the couch
it was soft enticing putting up his tanned
legs he crossed them at the ankles

  kortha tried to think to reason out
the danger of the room but even his
giant body knew the lassitude of fatigue
he closed his eyes trying to sort out facts
and interpret them shaking his head a
little muttering at his tiredness guantra
had the whiphand with hurlgut a cripple
and ilse and xax no help at all and
he kortha of what use was he sleep-
ing like a perfumed harlot on this couch
if he could raise an army now-

  his eyelids blinked against the tired-
ness beating up from deep within him
wave upon wave of languor swept to his
brain wrapping it in soft and gentle folds
he closed his eyes just for a minute
just until he was refreshed-

  kortha slept his big body lay utterly
relaxed every muscle inert like a lazing
panther the room was drugging in its
silence the thick draping seemed to
enfold to cradle

  kortha

  it was a voice like a wind whispering
in pines it soughed across the room mak-
ing the man turn lazily in his slumber
uneasy

  kortha speak to me tell me of your-
self who are you kortha

  the man slept but his lips spoke sigh-
ing i am kortha the strong the hard
the cruel

  ahhh no you must forget that
kortha true you are heavily muscled
but so are many men

  i crippled hurlgut my best friend in
a fit of rage i am not to be trusted my
temper is the red heart of the living vol-
cano it can spew destruction

  forget that you are kortha he never
existed you are not that kortha but
another tell me about this best friend
kortha tell me tell me

  kortha whispered the tale shuddering
even as he slept

  the voice spoke to him and its softness
was the purl of a wave lapping at the
shore

  you are wrong it happened thus-
kortha half-rose listening though his
eyes were closed and his breath came
evenly
engines of the gods	

  repeat after me-repeat -

  i saw hurlgut in his tower room we
did not quarrel over politics with earth
hurlgut did not call me names denounce
me as war-mad and enhanced with my
own powers the sun formed a pool at
his feet true but it was the guard-not
i-who leaped struck swift and sure
i slew the guard but the damage had been
done

  hurlgut slandered me he said i did
it i did not hurlgut was jealous of my
strength on mars he thinks i want
power on mars i do not guantra is the
one true leader of mars it was the guard
who crippled hurlgut the guard who
did it

  the guard did it

  the guard

kortha lay back in his cushions
muttering the room grew silent
once again then-

  kortha

  i hear

  tell me of your life kortha all of
it all the deeds of childhood all the
incidents tell me of your youth and
manhood speak to me and tell me
kortha spoke for hours while the voice
listened when he had done the voice
whispered once again and its sound flitted
through the arras-hung room susurrating
eerily

  your childhood pattern fits into sec-
tion j--k therefor the treatment
will be relayed over into that pattern with
emphasis on friendship

  if kortha had been awake he would
have heard the click of tiny wheels the
metallic rustle of machinery the flick of
a needle of compressed air on a metal
filament the drapes helped deaden those
sounds and kortha slept on

  kortha listen when you came from
fraysia to be a student at the academy
you remember that first day when you
met-guantra 

  no it had not been guantra it had
been hurlgut whom hed met there on
the white walk or had it really been
guantra was his memory that bad
guantra standing before him smiling at
him putting a friendly hand on his big
arm and saying you look like officer
material come with me id like to see

you fence you have the build for it
and it was guantra not hurlgut who
stood with him awed at the magic in the
lightning parry and thrust of the sword
in his hand he had defeated mayram
the champion that afternoon as guantra
looked on beaten him with a glittering
sword in his hand and a fire in his green
eyes and dancing joy in his heart

  he told hurlgut-no guantra about
it afterward in his rooms how his father
had had him taught by eric maccormac
the american who was tri-planet cham-
pion in all three weapons foil sabre and
epee and guantra listened pleased

  the voice went on whispering softly
speaking to him lifting from his memory
the threads of recollection removing the
very fibre of his character as a mason
lifts old tile to lay the new bit after
glittering bit of fact was slipped in to
take the place of memory fact that was
so plausible it became the truth

  it was guantra who had given him his
first engineering chance in letting him
charge and electrolize the bastion of cliff-
works surrounding radio city ruuzol with
cables and generators he had made those
mountain ridges of solid metals the sound-
ing board for a spacevox system that was
first in the solar system kortha had done
a great job on that thanks to guantra
later there were other triumphs then-
you fled to the desert to escape ilse
she sought after you trying to enmesh
you in her charms all the time you knew
she was the chosen of guantra guantra
loves her

  guantra is your friend you would not
steal the woman of a friend

  you gave her up you ran from her
hoping to lose yourself in the desert think-
ing ilse would forget   

  kortha stirred restlessly but relaxed
he listened absorbed

  ilse found you in your smithy you
wanted to find guantra to get his advice
so you went to yassa hurlgut sent men
to kill you you slew them instead and
fled again ilse came to tempt you but
you were saved by guantra he sent
use away and brought you to safety
kortha sighed softly

  guantra is your friend kortha the
two of you might easily rule mars two
friends to lead mars to its rightful place


planet

storses

among the planets you and guantra
true friends  

kortha whispered guantra is my
friend use is a wanton seeking my love
hurlgut hates me for hurlgut is jealous
that is correct now repeat all that
i have told you after me

  their voices susurrated in the draped
room their voices fled from wall to
wall and sank into oblivion the candle
that marked the hours and the days burned
lower only the voices lived and the
teeming brain of kortha that was taught
by an unsleeping patient mechanical
teacher

iv

it was still in the room when kortha
woke he stared around wondering
of course guantra had brought him here
to seek repose he chuckled youd
think he was a baby the way guantra
humored him always giving him the best
well that was the way of a friend for
you he clambered to his feet and rubbed
his arms with his big brown hands the
candle was spluttering in its golden socket
kortha frowned that candle had burned
for three days

  he must have been tired he recalled
it had been a new candle when guantra
had shown him into this room there
had been some question of his sleeping
and leaving no that could not be he
would have no reason to leave guantra
now but he must have been very tired
three days asleep

  kortha searched among the drapes
seeking an exit he found a tiny moon-
shaped door opposite his couch it opened
creakily under his palm and he stepped
into a tunnel lights switched on as
though by the heat of his body he
walked slowly frowning he did not
remember this passageway at all

  water lapped at rock ahead of him he
was puzzled there were no large bodies
of water on mars unless there were sub-
terranean seas that topographers knew
nothing of

  he hurried forward came to an abrupt
stop staring

  an underground cave widened before
his eyes throughout its shadowy length
the haze that filled it was tinted blue and

the waters of this undersurface ocean
blazed like blue fire in its reflection azure
stalagmites thrust up gnarled arms and
heads in eerie grotesqueries ahead of
him for mile after mile stretched that limpid
sea here and there a rock rose wet and
clamy above its blue surface shadows
gloomed in the distance

  kortha fell to his knees at the edge of
the stone floor fascinated by the water
he dipped a hand into it felt it cool and
soothing on his flesh

  startled he stared into its depths there
was something moving down among those
bluish fires something white and strange
something was flashing through the water
swopping up toward his kneeling figure
he saw white flesh and tossing hair he
saw flanks and breasts and churning legs

  her white hands and wrists broke water
first then use lifted her wet platinum
hair and shook it spraying drops she
put hands to his and let him lift her to the
ledge

  xax showed me a way through the
mountains that the tumblies used to know
long ago i hurried here kortha to get
you away before-

  his green eyes were sullen looking
down at her use stopped her flow of
words listening to him say guantra will
be glad to see you

  kortha thought this is the wanton in all
her seductive flesh see how the silver
hair brushes her smooth shoulders look
how her legs are straight and shapely that
red mouth is ripe for kisses and those
eyes of blue are looking at me with love
and affection

  he turned his face away from her
staring down the long emptiness of the
sea cavern

  use put her hand to her open mouth
staring in horror at the big mans averted
face her throat quivered uncontrollably
but she choked back the cry rising to ut-
terance her wet hands found his and
squeezed desperately

  oh my darling hes done it to you
as i knew he would unless i hurried i
thought i would be in time but it was a
hard trail up the mountains we had to
go on foot im too late too late
kortha shoved her away from him
roughly snarling save your blandish-
ments use you wont find them helpful
engines of t be gods	

with me you belong to guantra- i do
not find you attractive

  he lied and he knew he lied this
white witch of a woman with the red mouth
and the blue eyes and the platinum hair
was a draught to make a statue hunger
yet she was for guantra well guantra
deserved the best and yet 

 you must come with me kortha
hurlgut-

  hurlgut is jealous of me he slanders
me i have never given him cause to do
that he claims i broke his back but he
does not tell the truth it was the guard
not i the guard did it

  eyes closed ilse bowed her head her
heart was a thing of lead in her bosom this
mewling complaining thing was kortha
kortha who would spit in the face of a
living zut if he angered him she bit
her lip hard and tasted the drops of blood
that welled to the surface

  she looked up she said slowly we
are going to surprise guantra you see
if guantra could learn that with you all
mars would be his friend he would like
it if he heard from your lips that you
would back him as premier against earth
and venus-

  is there any doubt of that

  ilse knew she had to feel her way here
not knowing what kortha had been told
been made to believe in as truth she
must be wary step lightly iii her speech
explore his knowledge with words

 yes when you ran away to the
desert she looked at him curiously and
breathed again when she saw him nod
curtly there were some who said that
you and guantra had a falling out that
you ran from him as a sort of protest
kortha laughed looking at the girl
that is ridiculous you know why i ran
away because you wantoned after me
i ran away from you ilse

so that was the reason kortha had been
given ilse held her eyes shut tightly
her left hand bit its long fingernails into
the naked skin of her flank pain pain
would help to cancel the sodden ache in her
heart

  yes she whispered i know but
mars doesnt know that and mars has
to be told if mars could hear the truth
from your lips-

  come with me to radio-city ruuzol
kortha broadcast to mars be the first
to let the planet know you and guantra are
friends you be the first you his friend

  kortha nodded slowly he felt uses
hands squeezing his

  it must be a secret though we cant
let guantra know or the surprise would
be spoiled you have to come with me

  she saw his eyes light after a moment
and sheknew she had won that he would
go with her away from the blue grotto
and its magical machine that could steal
mens minds from them and give them
something different in exchange she
turned dove for the water

  kortha was beside her sinking into
the blue fire of water dropping down and
down past coral growths and bannery
weeds that slithered in ripples as the cur-
rents wafted them to and fro following
her threshing legs clinging to coral
branches as did she pulling himself along
kortha went under a ledge and rose swiftly
in a tiny cave

  ilse said as she treaded water my
copter is outside it will take us to
ruuzol

  ruuzol was the communication center
of all mars a vast glassine paraboloid
was built on a flat mesa against a cliffside
it housed vast turbines and generators
and the central controls as well as labora-
tories and rows of dwellings where the
men lived a fountain-dotted park gave
the small city an air of leisure

  their copter swooped in over the flat
plains surrounding the mesa casting its
shadow from the high cliffs all around the
plain out across the flatlands up onto the
mesa sides

  flanking the great transparent parabo-
loid were the twin tubes taller than the
dome itself thrusting their glass-and-steel
structures two thousand feet into the air
at their tops three metal planes were in-
serted into their trunks planes that were
the secret of the martian radio beams
planes that sent the spacevox rocketing to
earth and venus and the direct broad-
casts out over the sandy wastes of mars

  ilse flashed her copter past a tube and
spiralled gracefully to one of the white
landing strips beyond the dome

  they walked toward the paraboloid
ilse showed credentials to the guards at
	planet

the entrance then they were through and
into the cool pleasant air of the paraboloid
moving on one of the glass walks

  the harsh tones of the communicator
sprang to speech around them the prin-
cess ilse the princess ilse the em-
peror desires speech the emperor de-
sires speech

  kortha muttered something under his
breath but ilse pretended not to hear him
saying it will only be a moment

  they found hurlgut propped in cushions
flushed and worried his eyes opened wide
at sight of kortha and the worry fled

  kortha he cried putting out both
hands lifting a little where he sat so
ilse did find you

  ilse stepped to one side offering prayers
to zut

  kortha looked at hurlgut saw him lying
white and broken among the striped pil-
lows he wanted to rage at this liar at
this mongerer of scandal he learned
with a little surprise that he could not if
hurlgut wanted to blame him let him
kortha had never fought cripples before
he would not begin now

  -so good to see you man give me
your hand give it to me man there
let me look at you the same the same
big strong unbending mars only
hope i need you kortha guantra has
but now concluded speaking on the radio
beams he knows you fled from him
came here he traced you in that cos-
miclarifier of-his

  kortha remembered the black screen in
the flagship stateroom

  guantra will be surprised when i broad-
cast eh ilse 

  yes whispered ilse

  hurlgut looked surprised exclaiming
why guantra will not let you broadcast
kortha he will destroy ruuzol first he
threatened to in fact

  but he cant not until ive made my
speech to mars told them how he and i
will unite-

  ilse touched her temple and her heart
looking at hurlgut nodding toward kortha
then kortha was whirling on her saying
get me to a magnifone ill speak to
guantras ship tell him what i intend to
do the surprise is off ilse-but the
speech can still be made

  suddenly kortha swayed a little he

stories

put a hand to his forehead this was all
wrong ilse and hurlgut were his friends
no no it was guantra who was his
friend guantra has always befriended me
he gave me my start it is with him that
my fortune lies i must tell him so

  but ilse

  look at her man look at her blue
eyes again they are so serious so sad
as she watches you there is naught of
the wanton there a wanton would laugh
and giggle and be gay instead there is
yearning and sorrow and love in her eyes
as she regards you

  and hurlgut

  he lay helpless in his cushions unable
to move below the waist he looked at
kortha too and there was pity in his
eyes kortha did not fight with men who
could not walk to meet him did guantra
he had the sharp hard conviction that he
must know the answer to that it might
help him decide incongruities

kortha sighed he wished that he
could solve this enigma that turned
him inside-out in puzzlement he found
himself liking ilse and hurlgut even know-
ing what he did to them and learned he
was close to hating guantra guantra
had the power hurlgut was a cripple
and ilse a girl could guantra fight them
with the armies and the fleets of mars and
still hold his head high could-he

  ilse stood at the open door watching
him kortha realized she had been stand-
ing there for minutes as he had thought
he scowled and muttered get me to
the magnifone ill speak to guantra

  following ilse to the lift kortha brooded
at her

  zut but she was lovely if only
she were not the wanton he knew her
for and yet-always that    and yet 
and yet there was nothing of the wanton
about her the perfume from her fur
bolero floated around them in the lift it
reminded him of things that perfume of
memories that were stored so deeply in
his subconscious that he had completely
forgotten them kisses over the canals in
a drifting coptondola an academy dance
with ilse wearing a black filmy thing that
made the blue of her eyes and the silver
hair weirdly beautiful and those nights
when they had eaten cold fruit and drank
engines of the gods



of iced bessa-mead in the palace gardens
near colored-water fountains before he had
-before the guard had crippled hurlgut

  he could not square remembered hap-
piness with other memories there was
a leak somewhere he had to learn more-

  ilse he said

  the lift was opening and the girl was
going down the corridor kortha shrugged
and followed her he was probably mis-
taken those memories were the over-
flow from a forgotten dream

  in the big control room he stood watch-
ing ilse punch buttons a beam-man
stared at him from a corner panel-slot
let him look the name of kortha was
legendary on mars he heard ilse say-
ing guantra guantra into a fine
meshed magnifone

  the screen above the panelling came
alive with the premiers sneering point-
bearded face and his voice was harsh
cold

 so you got to kortha before me
ilse it is too bad i would like to know
whether-let me speak to him

  kortha stared up at guantras scowling
face the man was worried the way
his tongue licked unceasingly at his thin
lips the hands tugging at the crested metal
buckle of his belt the creases around his
narrowed eyes they were signal flares
pointing his anxiety there was something
bothering guantra too even as it both-
ered him

 what was it kortha had to know
kortha sucked in his breath realizing that
the duel was between him and guantra
each had knowledge and they had to
trade to know where they stood guantra
wanted to be sure of what of his friend-
ship but-why he himself sought to
test that elusive memory of his it told
him ilse was wanton and hurlgut a dan-
ger but his senses belittled that memory

  perhaps guantra could be persuaded to
give him the knowledge he sought he
put ilse aside placed mouth to the mag-
nifone

  kortha on the beam guantra tell me
something am i your friend guantra

  the man with the jutting beard licked
at his lips for a split second but it was
long enough kortha knew now that
guantra did not know that meant that
his senses might be right after all that

his memory was wrong and if his mem-
ory were wrong then ilse and hurlgut
were not what he thought them

  he listened to guantra bluster calling
out to him to recall and act on their old
friendship smiling grimly he leaned
closer to the image on the screen test
him kortha

  let me broadcast to all mars guantra
let me tell mars that we are friends
no said guantra swiftly that
would not be politic right now better
that you and i should meet kortha come
aboard my flagship

  afraid of what he might say the pre-
mier would not let him speak to mars
kortha wanted to know the reason why
guantra doubted their friendship look-
ing at the cold austerity the pride and
ambition of the man as marked in the lines
of his face and the manner of his bear-
ing kortha rather thought the reason was
not ilse a man like guantra would not
bother so about a woman

  i will broadcast guantra kortha said
slowly

  no i will have to stop that my friend
i cannot allow it until i have seen and
spoken with you face to face i am com-
ing in for you now

  they saw the premier reach out and
break connection

  kortha looked at the blank screen he
whirled on ilse and his big hands went
out to catch her by the shoulders and bring
her up close to him

  he said savagely tell me tell me
what i dont know why has guantra
turned against me why does he doubt
my friendship it cant be over you pie
is not the man to endanger his power for
a woman what is his reason

  her blue eyes were unafraid she said
guantra was never your friend i dared
not tell you before but i can now because
you have doubts of what your memory
tells you you saw how indecisive he was
he does not know whether his psycho-
analyser in the blue grotto had time to
change you i got you out of there be-
fore he knew before he had seen and
spoken with you

  the giant released her ran fingers that
shook a little through the thick mop of
his yellow hair frowning

  i dont understand what psycho-


planet stories

analyser what blue grotto wait-i
remember the grotto with the blue sea
but the rest is strange to me

  and the room fitted with drapes the
couch with the ocemar pelts

   i slept there

she told him then hurriedly of how
the psychoanalyser was one of the
machines guantra had taken from the
tower of zut in yassa and set it up in his
hidden lair and how he used it to turn
key men into his friends by giving them
new memories that were so closely linked
with their old that rarely were they so
much as hesitant about them only kor-
tha doubted and that was because ilse
had come to him before guantra she
picked up the thread of his life at the
smithy in the desert and went on with it

  once he interrupted with but it was
hurlgut who sent men to kill me in the
tower of zut

  ilse scorned that hurlgut send men
who on mars would serve a cripple when
guantra rules the fleets would hurlgut
hide in ruuzol if he could put his banners
in the air 

  when she was through he whispered
through stiff lips this psychoanalyzer
it changes men then

  guantra changed several men in coun-
cil positions with it he needed their sup-
port he got it it can make a brave
man a craven or a coward a hero it
was built by the ancients who understood
the mind as well as other sciences they
realized that the memory cells that gov-
ern many of our habits and thoughts
could be altered by hypnotically suggested
alterations they built a machine that
would do that we learned of it but could
never do anything about it people would
have laughed said we fought guantra
with myths

  kortha growled im still not sure but
ill fight guantra until i can make up my
own mind

  uses lips twitched wryly her shoul-
ders sagged a little as she leaned against
a table looking up at him

  fight guantra here in ruuzol you
are mad kortha there isnt a single
gun in ruuzol no weaponry of any sort
it cant defend itself was never intended
to this mesa is one mass of radio lab-

oratories and generators tubes and con-
densors

  no weapon no gun just a lot of
magnifones and words never killed any-
body yet kortha bared his teeth in a
silent snarl

  ill broadcast before he can stop me
let him fire on us then

  no he wont fire not yet have
you forgotten the lightning guns they
will cripple all our power we couldnt
broadcast past those metal mountains with-
out power

  the lightning guns kortha came up
short on that he cursed softly brows
furrowed aye he remembered the light-
ning guns psychoanalyser or no psycho-
analyser with them it would be as ilse
said guantra would break their power
land men and take over the city

  the laboratories he grated get me
to your laboratories there may still be
a way to stop those lightning guns

  ilse looked at him gasped suddenly at
the old flaring lights in his green eyes
she laughed softly gladly and turned
and ran ahead of him

  the ceiling lights were blue and bright
flooding the long laboratory chambers
where chrome and steelite glistened and
glass fittings refracted rainbows of color
against the scalloped walls black short
shadows flickered where men stood at
their places staring

  this is kortha said ilse head flung
back eyes blazing with azure fire if
anyone can stop guantra he can

  a sullen giant hulked forward from a
bench arms dangling scowling surrender
to him i say we have no chance against
the fleet the rest of you-guantra has
no fight with us why do we do what
one girl and one man tell us

  kortha uncoiled springing his fist
shot out like a flatheaded piston cracking
the sullen man on the jaw the splat of
the blow was loud in the silence broken
only by the brrring of the ceiling reflectors
lazily rotating

  over the body of the unconscious man
kortha snarled anyone else advise sur-
render 

  they looked at him and dropped their
eyes heads shook

  good get me blueprint papers and
diagrams of your ultraviolet radiator bat-
engines of the gobs



teries i want relayed batteries set up
and i must know how many i have to work
with

  ilse saw hope struggling for place in the
eyes of the men as they looked at kortha
she laughed gaily putting a hand on the
big mans arm saying loudly this is
kortha i told you he can pull miracles
out of a hole in space

  feet pounded on the linoleotile flooring
drawers opened banged shut glass cab-
inets clinked faintly and papers rustled
ilse stood against kortha touching him
smiling wryly

  only your name could make them hop
like that against the power that is guan-
tra theyre all loyal but practical they
know to an iotagram what chance hurlgut
has

  he has a good chance growled kor-
tha he did not look at her he did not
dare she was too lovely with her blue
eyes and platinum hair and the kissable
mouth he had not decided yet and
wanted his reason to figure this out not
his emotions

the men came and spread their dia-
grams and date-sheets and charts be-
fore him his keen eyes flicked back and
forth ran down columns studied hook-
ups and relays

  these batteries he said suddenly
pointing shift them there these oth-
ers over to this spot move those back
arrange them in arcs they must be dis-
tributed evenly around ruuzol here ill
work it out for you

  he sketched quickly with t-square
and callipers he strove for arrangements
on the blueprints and succeeded the
engineers and physicists looked at his work
and up at him puzzled kortha snorted

  the batteries will furnish ultraviolet
rays wont they in the patterns we set
by grouping them like this

  a young engineer nodded dubiously

  yes but-

  kortha rasped an oath stood up

  do what i say ill explain to you
later when i bring the final distribution
sheets to you youll have to follow my
instructions to the letter the radiator
batteries must be set so to make a pattern
thus any deviation will result in dis-
aster hurry

  up in the control tower the red light
was flickering kortha allowed himself a
smile the ultraviolet batteries were in
place needing only a fingerpress on a but-
ton beneath his hand to fire them he
looked up at the flagship maneuvering in
circles above the dome they were ready
up there now

  korta depressed the button and laughed

  an instant later white fires burst from
the guns of the flagship flaring zigzags
that darted toward the upright tubes on
either side of the paraboloid the metal
planes would draw that lightning it would
sear them crack them erupt into thunder-
ous cascades of escaping power-

   the lightnings never touched their target

  as though an invisible mantle of veins
were spread above the radio city the light-
nings sprayed away following the veins
grounding in showers of tiny sparks on
the plains below they made eerie trac-
eries of light over the city as the guns
spouted lightning again and again the
glassite dome was bathed in a white lumi-
nescent glow from the nets of meshed
zigzags in the air above it that ran in
streaks of jagged white fire all around
the city

  and always the lightnings grounded on
the plains the city lay untouched

  kortha chuckled he laughed aloud
he bellowed his mirth slapping a thigh
with his big hand yelping a million
kofuls to see guantras face id give right
now he must be swallowing his tongue
in rage ill bet hes hopping he doesnt
know what ive done he thinks im a
magician

  a lot of other people think the same
thing said ilse dryly including my-
self and those engineers theyll be
sweating their curiosity now that they see
how your diagrams are working they
pestered me with questions but i couldnt
answer them

  summon them grinned kortha

  when they stood silent before him he
laughed them into smiles one of them
echoed his laughter and then they all were
bellowing

  kortha said when they were wiping
tears of delight from their eyes lightning
follows a pattern through the air doesnt
it it follows beams of ionized air that
are everywhere those ionized air beams


planet

stories

flow down to ruuzol too the only way
to stop lightning from hitting us was to
form other ionized air currents that lead
it away from us

  a man with beaming face shouted
ultraviolet rays ionize air

  all we needed to do was set the bat-
teries of radiators up in such a sequence
that the lightning followed the ionized air
beams they created we made our own
air currents and naturally the lightning
had to follow them it couldnt get past
them

  the cheer that rang in the room dropped
to a hush as the screen glowed with guan-
tras snarling face

  youve won this round kortha but
im bringing the fleet here well see
if you can work magic against belching
guns however your evil genius can plan
it cant work miracles all the time you
-you imp of zuts black brother you
kortha laughed in his face

  the screen went dead

  the engineers went dead too until
kortha sent his booming laugh out at
them shouting let him bring his fleet
its the showdown fight we want let
him come to us ive an ace up my sleeve
that i havent played yet why if earth
and venus were to send their space fleets
here with guantra wed still win

  the men did not believe that but they
shuffled their feet uncertain it is hard
to doubt a man who has just performed
a miracle that your own eyes have seen
there is always that lurking thought that
he might pull another too

  ilse said we have no guns on ruuzol
this whole city is a gun said kortha
and laughed again

  his mirth was infectious the engineers
grinned and looked at each other and
laughed a little they hadnt the slightest
notion of why kortha laughed or why
they grinned but no one could resist such
a magnificent confidence in a city that was
without a weapon and yet a gun all by
itself

kortha spread his hands asking
this is a radio city isnt it it has
every science necessary to perfect radio
technique hasnt it get me xax he
and i have work to do

  the tumblie shrilled a greeting passing

the engineers leaving the room he rolled
across to the bronzed giant clicking his
needles eager curious kortha grinned
at him dropped to a knee to speak to him

  you are the only one in all ruuzol
who can do this job xax any other
who left here would be shot by the guards
guantra will post before he goes its
up to you will you help me fight guan-
tra i wont blame you if you refuse
tell me what you want me to do said
xax simply you waste time talking
nonsense

  kortha took xax to the tower window
and showed him the red cliffs that rose
all around ruuzol towering toward the
sky

  years ago when i first came to ruuzol
from the academy i sank cables into the
metal of those cliffs i laid them under-
ground to the mesa here i connected
their vast bulk with the generators and
tube relays of the city i have to know
if those cables are still attached you can
tell me i shall let you know what tests
to apply in the tiny caves where the cable-
controls are sunk you can perform those
tests with you feelers xax

  what tests kortha

  the giant told him repeating himself
for emphasis but the tumblie understood
and said so kortha watched him click-
roll out of the tower and rose sighing

  to ilse he said lets go back to the
laboratories again ill need to make more
diagrams get the engineers to meet me
theyll have to change cable terminals and
install them on a different hookup

  down in the laboratories ilse sat for
-hours watching kortha as he labored over
charts and graphs often without moving
more than hands and eyes for an hour at
a stretch when he was done he stood
up and stretched like a waking tiger he
grinned and handed the graphs to her
her eyes widened looking down
why this is just- she looked up
startled beginning to smile

  something any modern housewife
knows he agreed he laughed and said
guantra will call it more magic

it is magic ilse said softly it is
the magic of your brain that can think
of something like this at a time like this
bali chuckled kortha but he tingled
meeting her eyes
engines of the gods	

  hours later the western sky grew dark
with warships

  kortha and ilse stood once more in the
tower over the paraboloid city their arms
touching before kortha lay a white metal
box with a red enamel switch disappearing
inside it

  they watched the mighty battlefliers
loom sullen and black above the coppery
cliffs pointing their blunt noses down-
ward dropping one after the other from
the blue sky into the reddish plains below
they came swiftly in perfect echelon
masts flying the black panther banner of
guantra their gunports lay open the
lean metal nozzles of their guns glistening
in the sunlight

  zut whispered ilse guantra com-
pliments you he has stripped all of mars
to capture you

  xax said dryly the legend of kortha
is more than a legend it seems

  to destroy that fleet would cripple
mars for a decade kortha whispered
i couldnt do it unless i was sure that
the stakes we fight for are worth it

  we fight for mars said ilse

  yes yes i begin to believe that
when one man is so powerful he can do
with a warfleet what he will to achieve
his own personal ambitions-

  they stood silent watching the fleets
come black across the skies

  i can give them a taste of what theyre
going to get unless guantra surrenders
said kortha i neednt kill them all just
cause a few-ah-explosions

  guantra will never surrender

  his men will make him they will
realize i hold the trump cards in this little
game

  the fleets came in unhurriedly majes-
tically

  aboard each flier was purposeful or-
der as men ran across clean decks stood
warily at battle-stations swarmed into the
upper shrouds with small-arms a few
broadsides from those cannon would re-
duce ruuzol to smoldering ruins

  now  whispered ilse through wet lips
no not yet i want them all within
range

  minutes eked along slowly now the
ships were prow to bow circling the mesa
ilse shuddered looking at the empty holes
in the gun-muzzles she licked her lips

and found her tongue dry as the dust of
the yassan desert

  now said kortha and his hand
flashed out and the red lever swung over
hard

  it stayed over for short seconds  

ships and guns exploded in the air
as they wheeled around ruuzol vast
red flares sprang to life amid deafening
detonations metal budded and split
powder charges sloughed upward and out-
ward carrying men and equipment with
it in a crimson spray of destruction the
exploding magazines burst open the fliers
twisting and rending the metal hulls rip-
ping jagged holes lifting off entire deck
sections sending men and railings into
the air

  crimson ruin rained on the red plains

  ilse whimpered watching

  kortha swung the red lever back pant-
ing harshly

  there goes the mars you built sobbed
use

  we can rebuild ships said kortha
some men will die but not all as would
happen had i let the switch stay on a
while longer those men will build and
man new ships for a new mars had i
left the switch on too long not a living
thing would exist between ruuzol and
those cliffs

  kortha chuckled a little seeing distress
and surrender flags break from the masts
of every ship in the vast flotilla even
guantras flagship fluttered the white pen-
non

  send guantra to us in unconditional
surrender radio every flier that unless
guantra yields well kill them all we
wont have to make good that pledge
though the men and the commanders
out there are limp with amazement and
fright of the unknown they dont know
what weapon we use they thought them-
selves so secure from reprisal you see
the unexpected will make cravens of them
for the moment oh yes and tell guan-
tra and his men to come unarmed we in
ruuzol dont own a single gun

  minutes later a tiny flier broke from
the flagship and dropped toward the land-
ing strips on the mesa kortha still had
his hand on the red lever watching every
vessel that hung motionless in the air

stories

above the plain but there was no fight
in any of them kortha was right the
sudden destruction that had leaped from
the very silence around them had sapped
aggressiveness

  kortha had made his name spell magic
once again

 guantra was a beaten man as he
stepped into the glassite tower his cheeks
were sunken his eyes hollow above black-
ish rings he stumbled over the threshold
and kept licking his lips helplessly when
ilse saw his eyes she knew suddenly what
an enemy kortha was from the eyes of
guantra came the look that a slave might
cast to an adored idol that came to life
and thundered curses on him guantra
looked at kortha as though he expected
fire to shoot from his mouth and devour
him

  kortha grinned i told you you would
never beat me guntra are we friends
again 

  friends screamed the premier a
white froth at the corners of his thin
mouth you and i were never friends
we were always enemies we were des-
tined by fate to fight and you-by some
unknown magic you always win you
turn defeat to overwhelming victory al-
ways it isnt fair to other men are
you zut himself  but now-now that you
have won-taste what it feels like to-
lose

  from the depths of his despair guantra
acted his hand went to his tunic lifted
out with a heatgun in it

  his officers cried out at his treachery

  kortha came in low ducking under the
sizzling blast that burnt black splotches
on the white fur of his jacket his left
fist arced up sending the heatgun from
the numbed hand of the premier his
right hand came across in a blur of mo-
tion  struck like a piston against guantras
jaw his fist whipped the mans head up
and back making the hair fly like seafoam
striking a rock

  the crack of the neck breaking under
the titanic power of the blow was etched
against a frightened stillness

  ilse and the officers stared at the crum-
pling form of the premier whose knees
sagged lowering his body gently to the
floor his head hung at a sick angle from
his limp neck

  across the fallen body kortha looked
at the white-faced officers one of them
extended his hands palms down saying
search us kortha we came in peace

  kortha grinned again and waved a brown
hand

  my fight was with guantra i thought
he was my friend perhaps one of you
can tell me about-the blue grotto

  they were all of them myi from guan-
tras flagship eagerly their mouths spilled
words reciting the tale ilse already had
told him kortha stared down at guan-
tra grim-faced silent he sighed once
when they were finished and looked at
ilse

  and i never knew he said to her
softly

  he spoke to the officers it was true
then guantra is and has been my en-
emy and the enemy of all mars i am
glad to know that and he rubbed his
right fist thoughtfully

  can you find it in your heart to for-
give a fool he asked of ilse

  there were tears in her eyes she
stumbled forward was caught and crushed
tight against him his lips drank from
hers thirstily

  the officers moved their feet embar-
rassed kortha looked at them across
ilses platinum hair and laughed

  youll forgive me a moments human-
ity he said there are no terms to
give you i am returning to the council
from here on out mars will take her
place beside earth and venus this time
they wont back out of their agreements

the officers grinned at each other
wanting to yell their delight they
had known kortha in the old days one
of them stepped ahead hesitantly

 we-ah-we are very curious kor-
tha the way in which you beat us that
is there were no guns in ruuzol there
was no way to beat us you could not
defeat us yet you did when the ex-
plosions began guantra went a little mad
he called you brood of zut frankly a
lot of us thought there was something
supernatural about it too as a matter
of fact i still do and so do the rest of us

  kortha grinned at them saying as
a matter of fact you have the same weapon
i used aboard the flagship aboard every
engines of the gods



ship in the fleet for that matter

  they looked at him and their eyes
bulged

  kortha walked hand in hand with ilse
toward a cabinet inset in the tower wall
the officers came to stand around him in
a semi-circle watching him bring forth a
small box fitted with a row of electronic
tubes and cables fitted to two plates

  it looks like a radio set said one of
the officers

  it is replied kortha except that
it sends a stream of high frequency waves
back and forth between those plates in-
stead of a voice into space it internally
induces heat into an object placed between
the plates

  kortha took an iron bar and set it on
the lower plate he turned switches look-
ing down almost instantly the bar glowed
faintly red then waxed brighter and
brighter from brilliant crimson it turned
white with heat kortha flipped the cur-
rent off

  the electronic tubes shoot a flow of
high frequency waves between the plates
but thats ancient protested an of-
ficer we cook that way on board-

  he broke off eyes widening he man-
aged a sickly grin

  kortha said i know it i ate a meal
cooked that way on the flagship house-
wives cook this way all over the three
planets you see i am no magician after
all thats what i did to your ships
my two plates were charged cliffsides and
the mesa from the batteries of giant
electronic tubes in ruuzol i spread those
waves back and forth caught your ships
in their flow as food is caught or as the
iron bar the high heat that was pro-
duced internally exploded every powder

magazine and bit of gunpowder on your
vessels it literally blew them up from
inside thats why it was so swift and
sudden so silent

  one of the officers shuddered spasmod-
ically whispering if youd left the power
on still longer youd have cooked every
one of us alive

  kortha looked at him one of the
younger men looked sick he turned away

  you were generous exclaimed an older
officer in your place-

  you men are part of mars my quar-
rel was not with you i need you to build
mars up again to make her one with
earth one with venus we must unite
the clans make the confederacy strong as
ever then we shall send deputies to
earth and venus

  i rather think that this time they shall
listen to us

  he said again go to your ships have
them refitted and repaired then return
for me two weeks from today

  the officers bowed and departed

  ilse stirred in korthas arm looking up
at him

  two weeks she whispered

  you and i are returning to the blue
grotto after i get my real personality
back-minus my red-hot temper-we will
return to ruuzol

  his hands drew her to him

  two weeks is a short honeymoon but
for an old hermit like me it will be an
eternity of happiness

  their lips met avidly as the shadows
of the departing fliers flickered one by one
across their bodies and disappeared over
the horizon

  across the empty red plains of ruuzol
rolled a tumblie xax was going home
survival

by basil wells

mindless creatures mewled and grovelled in the streets of
ohio  and men found themselves suddenly in the swampy
alien hell of venus fighting a weird battle for existence

the experiment flopped

or perhaps more accurately speak-
ing it succeeded only too well

  the theory had been that of plucking the
ego from one human domicile and trans-
planting it temporarily of course into the
brain of another man-or animal the
machine had been built for the same pur-
pose

  circuits shorted and the resultant blast
of power killed doctor brixson and his
elderly assistant elmer morgus and out-
ward the circle of unleashed power extend-
ed for a mile from crayton college

  the egos wrenched from their rightful
places went hurtling outward into space
on the light-speeding wave of the blast and
contacted that of life on our sister planet
venus and mindless things grovelled and
mewled in the streets of crayton ohio  

  only since the malcolms successful voy-
age to venus recently has the full story
of that catastrophe been known from the
lips of the rubbery hided hideous venusi-
ans who came to earth aboard the spacer
we learned the truth

  this then is the story of those earth-
lings flung into that swampy alien hell of a
world by the freakish blast of an experi-
mental patchwork of wires tubes and odd
scraps of quartz it is the tale of their
battle for survival in a sodden unfriendly
environment

  glade masson timid myopic history
professor at crayton college jerked his
head from the dank grayish ooze of the
hollow where he lay his eyes snapped
wide as he examined the foggy outlines of
bushes and twisting vines surrounding him
further than the length of two bodies he
could not see

   lo a croaking voice mumbled from
close by

  masson looked up into the blinking
round dark eyes of the alien creature he
examined the naked human-shaped animal
curiously as he came to his feet

  that the strange being was intelligent he
realized at once the sharp dagger of splin-
tered bone depending from a cross band
of mildewed hide told him that but the
noseless broad-joweled face the hairless
slick grayness of the froglike body shad-
ing to a dark purple around the two eyes
and the generous slit of a mouth the
webbed hands and feet and the drooping
pointed ears were anything but human

  a frog he gasped amazed an intel-
ligent batrachian he rubbed his hand
across his eyes and arrested the motion

  his hand was webbed and gray he had
six fingers instead of five and his sleek
body was naked save for the crossed belts
of ridged hide supporting his own two dag-
gers

  masson belched this strange new body
of his had dined on fish he discovered and
probably very overripe fish at that he
flexed his thick gray arms admiring the
ripple of sleek hard muscle blood was
pumping and throbbing through his body
with the excitement of the moment for
almost the first time in his forty years of
myopic boyhood and timid manhood glade
masson felt alive

 luxuriantly the man from earth
stretched he saw an expression that
he took to be amazement cross the strange
beings features the purple deepened
around the other males sunken nostrils

  i the frog man said amdoctor john
lawler

	planet

  massons mouth dropped open what
must have happened back there in crayton 
his last memory was of a horrible wrench-
ing at his delicate stomach and then an
abrupt blacking out of the auditorium
apparently his ego and that of doctor
lawler as well had by some mysterious
means been exchanged with that of these
froglike beings

  suddenly he smiled this was probably
another of his nightmares he would shut
his eyes pinch himself hard and command
himself to awaken

  he pinched he heard lawler screech
in terror slowly he opened his eyes

  an ugly beast a reptilian monster of
scales and gaping tooth-lined snout came
lumbering toward him on stubby crooked
legs ten feet in length was the alligator-
like saurian its lumpy black plates sprout-
ing an ugly ridge of yellowish spines along
its back down to its broad flat tail

  masson took to his heels he bounded
away across the springy carpet of water-
logged vines after the fading sounds of the
doctors spurting webbed feet

  fog closed in around him twice he
fell into seemingly bottomless pools of
water and his alien body surfaced him in-
stinctively and dragged him ashore so he
could continue his flight no longer did he
hear the running feet of doctor lawler
yet he continued to run

  so it was that he came into a section of
the vine-floored mistiness where stubby
leafy-boled shrubs grew from the spongy
soil and as he approached closer to the
pale-leaved little trees he heard the excited
babble of slurred half-familiar words he
looked more closely at the trees then to
discover that just above his head a thatch
of living vines leaves and grasses topped
each pulpy yellowish trunk

  gray faces hideous and limp of ear
peered down at him he had come across
a village of the frog people from the
trees of this sunless foggy jungle they had
fashioned shelters of a sort

  as his breathing eased he could hear
them more plainly no wonder their speech
sounded familiar he realized they were
speaking english  lawler and he were not
alone then probably all of crayton was
here-possibly all of ohio

  i tell you that was charles ellis the
chemistry department head im positive

stories

this is not earth may sound crazy to you
but im sure this is the planet venus

  masson nodded his head in agreement
but some of the other men snorted their
disgust

  impossible grunted one scarred old
frog-man blinking his one good eye and
flapping his ears at a persistent buzzing
insect winging around his hairless skull
i say this must be the amazon river
country-though how we came here i
wouldnt know

  no familiar fauna and flora ellis
said shrugging nope i disagree the
only logical choice is venus or perhaps a
similar environment in another dimensional
plane he got to his feet and walked
across the rough floor of the large hut to-
ward the descending ladder of lashed poles
but ill not argue with you he con-
cluded we must hang together now as
never before

masson followed his friend down
the ladder as he descended into the
misty sea of fog he regarded the changed
village that a score of this watery worlds
days had seen created- the boles of the
trees had been utilized as foundation piles
for more substantial and water-tight struc-
tures and now the two thousand and
twenty-nine exiles from earth were well-
housed

  this is the reality charles masson
said his wide sunken nostrils drinking deep
of the thick moist air already our life
back on earth seems an unpleasant dream
here the swamplands furnish us food in
plenty and the temperature seldom varies
more than a few degrees

  the steady dark eyes of ellis regarded
masson seriously then he lifted the crude
spear bone-tipped and heavy and touched
the curved projection of the bow above his
shoulder

  three times he said we have been
attacked by hostile natives only our su-
perior weapons have given us the advan-
tage he paused the next time we
may not be so lucky the frogs may have
copied our spears and bows

  that is the reason we must not be satis-
fied we must build machines and better
weapons for our own protection here on
venus we are but a handful of aliens sur-
rounded by millions of hostile savages
survival	

  masson grunted doubtfully with
-what he inquired are we to build ma-
chines all the islands that we have vis-
ited by raft or swimming are like this one
-soggy floating atolls of thidin vines and
nik-nik brush the natives have no metal
weapons even flint seems unknown

  ellis rammed his webbed gray hand
down into the pouch that hung at his side
when it emerged again a sharp fragment
of black glassy rock lay in his palm he
grinned at massons amazement

  one of the frogs he said that we
captured yesterday had this on a loop of
leather around his neck with the few
words we have learned and signs i learned
that a mountain of this material lies to-
ward the east

  land was all masson could gasp
reverently he fingered the bit of glassy
obsidian his eyes blinked with excite-
ment and his grotesque slash of a mouth
quivered

  what are we waiting for he de-
manded eagerly lets get going

  ellis laughed tolerantly the island
lies some distance away he said we
will need good rafts or better canoes
hostile natives probably live in the mud-
lands surrounding the island

  lets get to work on it then urged
glade masson we can kill a lot of these
alligator-jawed vallids and use their skins
for boat covering the eskimos do that
and we can make shields of their hides
too well need extra arrows food and
other supplies

   go to it laughed ellis ten or fif-
 teen of the younger men will probably want
 to go along he blinked his round black
 eyes solemnly and youre the guy that
 was satisfied with things as they are

he little flotilla of skin-
covered canoes threaded its way among
the misty islets of pale green thidin vines
ten of the unwieldy craft there were and
in all save the two larger boats two power-
fully muscled frogs sat the larger boats
carried three paddlers and were well-laden
with dried vallid flesh broiled thidin shoots
and heaps of the scarlet-mottled orange
nik-nik fruit

  hear about susan martin inquired
ellis as he dipped his paddle rhythmically

 -planet stories-spring

 into the sullen waters of the mist-shrouded
 sea

  nope massons head did not turn
his canoe was leading the expedition
heard she was visiting crayton but never
heard what happened to her

  always lecturing about birth control
and child psychology chuckled ellis as
uncompromising a spinster as ever i met
well thats all changed now she finds
herself with a family of seven young
frogs on her hands

  whew gasped masson bet she
hates that

  oddly enough the chemistry instructor
said shes taking to being a mother en-
thusiastically her seven little frogs will
be the neatest best-scrubbed insufferable
little prigs in all new crayton-even old
joe hansel the ex-town drunkard hes
her next-to-the youngest son

  masson shook his hairless gray head
thoughtfully the mystery of the switch-
ing of his neighbors and friends egos
with the former inhabitants of these tough
gray bodies never ceased to amaze him
the former sex of their transferred intel-
ligences had been preserved but not their
age

something like cunningham the cam-
pus heart-breaker he said only he
ended up an old hideously wrinkled frog
and a good end for him cried ellis
warmly he was  

  ssst warned masson peering along a
steaming tunnel of vision that a chance
breath of moist air had opened a raft
and half a dozen frogs

  they relayed the word back to the seven
smaller craft and four of them swiftly
drew abreast of the canoe of masson and
ellis the other three canoes remained to
guard the cargo boats with their three
paddlers

  well investigate ordered masson
softly unless they attack do not harm
them with the few words of their lan-
guage we have learned perhaps we can find
where the rocky island is located

  fat chance growled the huge-shoul-
dered scarred young frog whose name was
dolan they attack and talk later
those are orders said masson firmly
his eyes boring into those of the other
when you elected me leader of this ex-
pedition i took full control suggestions i
	 planet

will listen to but you must follow orders

  dolans eyes wavered i didnt say
nothing he grunted

  two canoes slipped silently away to the
left and the other two sped toward the
right masson continued straight ahead
toward the raft

  suddenly the mist parted the foggy
outlines of a half-dozen frogs were re-
vealed and across the crudely plaited sur-
face of the raft of buoyant thidin stalks lay
the bound body of a young female frog
masson had time to see that the female
wore a brief skirt and confining band of
beaten vegetable fiber-a woman stolen
from their own village of new crayton-
before the natives hurled their lumpy cud-
gels of nik-nik at him

  he ducked the clubs missed only one
of them thudding into the hide-bound gun-
wale beside him and then the frog men had
plunged into the familiar medium of the
warm sea they swam swiftly toward the
two men in the boat their bone knives in
their powerful webbed fists

  masson hurled his spear at one of them
a gurgling cry of pain attested to the ac-
curacy of his aim he saw ellis spear leap
forward and bury itself in the sea and
then his bow was in his hands and the
bowstring swiftly nocking into the bone-
tipped shaft of an arrow but the frog
men were upon them

  the other canoes converged then ar-
rows frothed the water around the swim-
ming savages blood dyed the water with
shifting red and the ghastly coils of
glistening snake-like things of the deep
attracted by the blood fought for the
bodies the water boiled into frenzy as
shark-like fish came also and battled with
the coiling scavengers of the deep the
canoes rocked and threatened to swamp
despite the frantic paddling of the men

  all of the frogs were dead but their
raft bobbed unharmed outward from the
seething cauldron of fighting monsters
the bound woman watched with fearful
eyes as masson and ellis paddled closer
and then she cried out with joy as she saw
their weapons and the simple breech clouts

  thank god she gasped as masson
stepped aboard and freed her bonds she
chafed gently at the swollen flesh where
her gray-skinned legs and arms had been
bound

masson swallowed hideous though
she might have been by an earthly
standards to him she was beautiful her
body was firm and shapely and her eyes
were soft and liquid and in his body there
coursed the blood of the frog people al-
ready he was forgetting the standards of
beauty back on earth grace strength
and the clean-cut planes of the body are
the secret of loveliness

  i cannot blame them for stealing you
he said thick-tongued i have not seen
you before in new crayton who are
you 

  irene croft she said smiling and
you i know are glade masson i saw
you working on these canoes before i was
captured

  the ex-instructor of history felt his
mouth drop open this most charming of
all females he had seen on venus was irene
croft croft the slab-sided bony woman
who had taught languages at crayton col-
lege-the fussy old maid without a saving
grace or charm save her intelligence and
quick understanding  they had been good
friends back there on earth but now-
well friendship would not be enough

  irene he said enthusiastically youre
a-a-honey

  his face turned purple as she smiled her
gracious acceptance of his compliment
words gurgled impotently in his throat as
he helped her aboard the canoe

  son said charles ellis gruffly youve
got it bad and he scowled at the trim
figure sitting between them i dont blame
you

  this time it was irenes face and neck
that purpled delicately

  sorry we cant take you back to new
crayton said masson his grin anything
but sorry but we must be almost to the
rocky island we are hunting

  the girl flashed a quick smile at masson
a smile that would have given the ordinary
earthman a series of nightmares you
are right about the island she said i
have picked up a fair knowledge of the
speech of the butrads

  so thats what they call themselves
broke in ellis sorry miss croft go
on

  the island is called tular she said
they were taking me there to give me as
a bride to the god-from-the-clouds as i
survival



translated it but i feel sure that i was to
be sacrificed in some ghastly religious
fashion

  from-clouds ellis was musing
probably a meteorite his face bright-
ened a meteorite may mean iron he
cried

  massons paddle dipped steadily into the
murky waters of the cast sea that covers
all venus floating miniature islets of
thidin swirled past islets that some day
might grow to be huge matted sub-conti-
nents of green life ghostly islands of
thidin their swampy floors giving root to
the stocky trees and shrubs of the venusian
jungle growth loomed out of the endless
blanket of fog the throaty deep roar of
the scaly vallids and the splash of their
bodies broke the thick silence

  and iron means machines and weap-
ons he said thoughtfully without turning
around machines-and plows weapons
-and hoes we will build factories but
we will also build homes

  irenes voice cut across their musings
supposing the meteor is not iron she
demanded

  the sea is full of metal said ellis
doggedly we will take magnesium from
it we did it on earth and the island
will contain metal-it must

  spears called masson unexpectedly
and then tersely vallids just ahead

  the canoes slowed and sheered off from
the pulpy underwater shelf of the island
masson had almost rammed hundreds of
the scaly monsters floated sleepily in the
water their yellow spines and bulging eyes
carpeting the shallow depths for several
acres ashore dozens of others crawled
about on their stubby bowed legs searching
for the tasty vegetable tidbits that their
saurian palates desired

  luckily none of the vallids saw them or
if they did they were not interested and
they backed water until the eternal low-
lying clouds of the wet planet shielded
their ungainly craft from view they
commenced paddling cautiously away to-
ward the right only to again encounter the
shore of an island swarming with the ugly
snouted saurians

  at intervals they attempted to proceed
again in the direction they had been head-
ing but always they encountered more val-
lids and the low-lying shore of an island

an idea was beginning to dawn in massons
gray-skinned skull this must be a larger
island than any they had before encoun-
tered

  perhaps he said as the other canoes
drew abreast this is the shore of tular
there would be swamplands and mud flats
if it were thidin would grow up about
the central mountain

  a slim-faced frog man named reppart
nodded probably youre right he agreed
never saw so many vallids before he
shrugged his shoulders but how do we
get through them to the land 

  should be a river ellis was dipping
out the water that the ceaseless heavy mist
of rain poured into the boat he gestured
with the hollow gourd-shaped husk of a
nik-nik fruit we follow the river in
but we have found no river sneered
dolan what now general masson
irene crofts softer voice cut across their
conversation

  but we have found the river she said
see the current pushing out toward us
from the island and the color of the
water is different grayer

  youre right cried masson exultantly
he picked up his paddle and sent the canoe
probing forward into the thick murk of
the cloudy wall ahead

three or perhaps four miles
the men from earth paddled upstream
along a mile-wide channel that carried the
steady surge of the river seaward they
came at last to the first waterfall a low
rocky shelf that lifted but five feet above
the green floor of swampy thidin vines
and the grayish ooze that floored them

  the firmness of rock was welcome un-
derfoot the slow darkness of the venu-
sian night was falling and so they made
their camp on a level shelf of rock a few
hundred feet back from the waterfalls
muted roar

  and with morning they pushed onward
up the river

  the stream forked a mile above the first
waterfall they chose the larger stream on
the right and paddled between low sullen
black cliffs of basalt for perhaps another
three miles here a lake spread outward
fanwise from three giant cataracts that
boomed and frothed as they poured over
a sheer hundred-foot precipice
	planet

  power said masson power enough
for a dozen pittsburghs power to light
all the cities of earth

  this is a large island ellis nodded
such a volume of water requires an enor-
mous watershed he smiled confidently
there will be metal here this will be
the home of our children

  masson found his hand had uncon-
sciously clasped that of irene he pressed
the velvety softness of the webbed fingers
and the womans eyes lifted curiously to his
own a steady intense glow burned far
back in their depths her lips parted un-
smiling

  our children he whispered softly and
her eyes dropped as purple spread slowly
upward from her rounded firm neck

  she pressed his hand timidly dropped
it and started up the rocky ledge that led
from the lakes left-hand shore and be-
hind her climbed the frog men from the
village of new crayton

  their canoes they had concealed in the
tangled jungle growth from here their
feet would have to serve-their feet and
the tough sandals of vallid hide that they
now donned for the first time

  the sheer escarpment gave way to a vast
level plain of jungle growth and swampy
reeds the jungle was almost impenetrable
and so they decided to swim up the river
the eternal clouds of venus seemed to
have thinned as they climbed for now they
stood within a grayish dome that extended
a hundred feet or more on every hand

  as they approached the river they saw
a huge raft of thidin bound about with
sturdy vegetable withes and having a score
of sturdy poles lashed to its rough surface
but for the increased range of their vision
they would have missed the man-made little
island

  masson trimmed the green shoots that
were already sprouting from the pole he
had chosen his bone knife broke as he
hacked at a tough sprout

  with our first iron he said i will
make an axe the axe and the machete are
the first tools of civilization

  twice they climbed past mighty water-
falls again they came at last to the
fertile central plateau that stretched for
tliree hundred miles away to the north
and south and a third of that distance
before them

stories

  four native villages they passed and
four times irene used her meager com-
mand of the butrads tongue to tell them
that they were on pilgrimage to the god-
from-the-clouds and that she was to
be the gods bride apparently the ordi-
nary inter-tribal warfare of the butrads
was held in abeyance where the god-from-
the-clouds was concerned

  they crossed park-like country where
beneath the pale-green trees a tough spear-
bladed grass grew and they slept at night
in the shelter of broad-leaved trees that
roofed over several acres of ground so
completely that there were patches of dusty
earth

  masson sent dillen marcy reppart
and dolan back to report to the settle-
ment at new crayton he advised that
as many families as possible be ferried
across the sea to tular here on the
upper plateau would be their new world

the day after the four messengers had
left they came to the god-from-the-
clouds

  an ancient crater housed the god a
low-rimmed bowl five miles in diameter
the jungle had crept over the outer walls
and far down the inner slopes to the edge
of the lake within the trail they fol-
lowed ended abruptly at a cliff on whose
brink a triangular block of greenish-black
basalt rested there were mounds of
rounded white objects human skulls about
the rough altar but the broken white
skeletons of the sacrifices lay thick about
the god far below

  irene shuddered she hid her head on
massons chest the brides of their god
she sobbed brides of the machine

  the god of the butrads of venus was
a huge crumpled ball of metal-a space
ship from some distant world

  a distant and alien world the battered
craft must have come from for the cor-
ridors and cabins were too small for the
froglike bodies of the earthmen to pass
yet the space ship was gigantic by any
standard-a quarter of a mile in diameter
there were strange corroded weapons and
machines whose use the earthmen could
not fathom there was sealed cargo-
food that even et was edible after long
years of exposure to the heat and humidity
of the venusian upland
survival



  the ship was a veritable storehouse of
precious metals and equipment ellis set
to work at once designing a dynamo and
drew plans for a machine shop to be set
up in a nearby cavern masson took two
of the men and examined the defensive
possibilities of the craters upper rim-he
feared the reaction of the frogs when
they learned of this desecration of the
god-from-the-clouds irene put two of
the men at work clearing out another cave
for a kitchen and sleeping rooms and
gilroy who had been a farmer cruised
the rich lava-fed flat along the lakes rain-
speckled shore

 busy days and nights passed they
lost all track of time no word came
from new crayton but they were so busy
they paid no heed the waterfall that
fed the crater lake now turned a dynamo
and electricity worked its magic at the
two passes that permitted descent into the
crater guards were now posted armed
with crude muskets and grenades and the
signal that was to mark the approach of
the party from new crayton was three
spaced shots

  they are coming at last cried irene
the third shot echoed soddenly through
the thick air she tugged at massons
arm we must go to meet them
laughing they raced up the trail from
the craters green depths to the high wall
where the sentry stood guard they stood
beside him breathless for a moment
then massons hand went out impulsively
to the shoulder of the man

gilroy man he cried what is it
the guards drooping shoulders straight-
ened bitterly his webbed hand pointed

 a handful of butrads men from new
crayton by their arms and clothing
tramped wearily nearer masson counted
them-thirty-three men as he watched
one of them dropped soddenly an arrow
in his back then for the first time did
he see the misty shapes of the pursuers of
this exhausted band

  they raced forward hundreds of them
the naked frog-like savages of the lower
river villages another of the hunted men
dropped and masson jerked the gun from
gilroys hands and trained it on the horde
of charging butrads

  he fired the sound of the shot rather
than the bullet arrested the enemy advance

momentarily from the harried little knot
of men a faint cheer lifted and their
pace quickened a moment later gilroy
swung open the thick narrow gate and
was helping the first of them through
masson lobbed a grenade far out toward
the island frogs and they shrank yet far-
ther away

  did our best that was reppart sob-
bing out his story three hundred of
us    rest of them decided to live easy
back on the island    maybe they wasnt
too dumb either   

  anyhow the frogs hit us at the first
waterfall    finished off most of the
women and children there  we fought
them all along the river    rest of the
women died there  eighty of us reached
the plateau

  and thirty of you are left finished
masson soberly his round eyes blazed
hot fifty of us to conquer a watery
jungle world fifty men against a planet
he shook a knotted gray fist at the
hostile natives therell be no more con-
tact with new crayton he said we can-
not risk more of our manpower in futile
warfare if we are to build a worthy civili-
zation for our children this crater must
be our world for many years

  one of the men laughed bitterly and
then great racking sobs shook his stocky
gray body

  children he cried all our children
lie out there unborn among us all there
is only your woman

  glade masson swept his arm out toward
the seething mob of the butrads there
are your children he said the natives
have daughters and sisters their blood
is that of our own bodies they will
bear us children we and our children
will conquer and rule the water wastes of
venus he paused for a long moment

  to survive he said flatly we must
fight with all means at our command we
must steal we must kill and we must work
if we do not steal the females of the
butrads earths culture and wisdom will
shortly vanish if we do not kill we will
be killed

  the round dark eyes of the listening
earthmen brightened with new hope
croaking sounds of approval issued from
their ugly slashes of mouth and hope-
less sloping shoulders straightened
	planet

so it was that they raided the
villages of the frogs again and again
the females of the surrounding uplands
proved to be intelligent and shortly most
of them were happy in the safety and
comfort of the building town of the earth-
men

  they mated with the men and learned
the strange customs and speech of their
captors

  but there was trouble looming ahead
as the months passed and the eggs of
the females failed to hatch masson and
ellis realized that their little colony was
doomed to extinction

  the women tell the same story
glade said ellis his nervous webbed
fingers drumming at the table in his tiny
office

  masson looked out through the window
at the men moving about their tasks in
the factory and further down beside the
lake in the fields they worked listlessly
hopelessly what was there to work for
now

  so the old women of the tribes carried
the eggs away and hid them masson
rubbed the unlovely flesh of his jowls
thoughtfully they were forbidden to
follow taboo or something of the sort
and then the old females brought back
the young ones

  could be of course said ellis doubt-
fully that they are concealing the truth
lying to us he shook his head but i
doubt it most of them are glad to be
safe here where raiding tribes and the
more vicious saurians cannot reach them
they learn fast too he added

  nothing to do masson said grimly
but for me to trail the old women ill
take dolan hes never satisfied unless
hes prowling the jungles outside the
crater

  im going too ellis began but mas-
son shook his head

  your knowledge of chemistry and
metallurgy are needed here he said if
i am lost you can carry on but you are
the only living text book available

  and he overrode the others protests

  later in the day masson and dolan
slipped out through the barrier at the
craters rim and made their way toward
the nearest butrad village they took with
them plenty of ammunition and supplies

stories

for they expected to be gone for man
days

  there they go glade joe dolans
scarred face twisted in a hideous parody
of a grin

  they lay in the lush oozy bed of rotted
growth above the shallow ravine where the
frog village lay nik-nik brush and
giant broad-leaved grass of mottled yellow
and green concealed them from the eyes of
the butrads in the ugly huddle of elevated
huts below

  ten old females went on dolan
maybe they can carry twenty eggs apiece
in their baskets he whistled thatd
be two hundred

 how asked masson can you
whistle with a mouth like that ive tried
dozens of times

  dolan chuckled its a gift he said
and came to his hands and knees

  take your time cautioned masson
just so we keep them in sight

  the ravine narrowed and became a ver-
tical-walled tunnel of thidin vines and scaly
gray rock masson and joe dolan lost
sight of the slow-moving party of frogs
at times as they moved along the rim of
the deep slot and as they followed the
floor of the ravine fell further away be-
neath them they were climbing high into
the stunted cliffs and peaks of tulars
interior

  night came and they slept above the
stopping place of the ten butrad ancients
and with morning they pushed upward
through the soupy fog again

  abruptly the upward slanting slope
ended they looked out over a roughly
oval bowl of slowly writhing mist and
cloud

 dimly they saw the floor of the
cavity several hundred acres of jungle-
clad raggedness miniature buttes mesas
and cliffs split the bowl into a hell of
broken terrain and here and there near
the black pocks of caverns in the rimming
cliff walls there showed little huddles of
butrad huts

  the place of birth masson said
slowly all the tribes of the island must
come here

  dolan nodded and rubbed the palm of
his hand over the whetted edge of his hunt-
ing knife plenty of guards stationed
around the only entrances he said just
survival	

  as you expected ill have to kill them
- off

   masson shook his head that would
  warn them i may need weeks to learn
  the secret of their system of hatching the
  eggs his webbed gray hand swept in
  a short arc

    some of those caves must have other
  entrances from the rim perhaps thats
  what well look for

    dolan shrugged right you are he
  agreed

   my theory is masson said that
  venus was formerly much warmer than
  it is now for that reason the incubation
  temperature must be artificially raised
  the question is how much and how long
  must the eggs be artificially warmed and
  do they use pools of all-but boiling water
  or is the heat comparatively dry
  thats for you to find out said dolan
  me im nothing but a truck driver i
  aint no college-brain guy

    you do all right said masson grin-
  ning you seem to find your way around
  the jungle easy as a native

   huh snorted dolan ten years
  hammering the pavements and dodging
  traffic does that you gotta have a quick
  eye and remember what youre doing
  masson got to his feet and moved back
  from the brink

    lets start hunting he suggested

 they crouched together in

  the dark shadows of the tunnel that
  opened a dozen feet above the floor of the
  large cavern down there in the gray
  half-light that filtered in through the outer
  entrance they saw three small heaps of
  vegetation steaming silently and the two
  old females who tended them

    from time to time one of the old fe-
  males filled a hollow husk from the nik-nik
  fruit with water and sprinkled it over the
  three mounds the eggs they had seen
  the ancient ones bury so carefully were
  soaking up the moist warmth

    masson jogged dolans elbow and they
  crawled carefully back along the low-
  roofed passage toward the vine-festooned
  entrance five hundred feet above water
  and gray ooze sloshed underfoot as they
  walked along level reaches of the way
  and always the wet rock was slippery
  we know how the eggs are hatched

now he said and with experience we
can learn to gauge the proper tempera-
ture but until we have perfected the
procedure our families will not increase
very rapidly

  dolan gulped i dunno if i want one
of them ugly looking things we saw in
that side pen he said

  theyre no uglier than you are joe
chuckled masson hunt up a pool of
clear water and look at yourself some-
time he gripped dolans arm

  but thats what i was thinking about
he went on about that side pen in the
cave where the newly hatched butrads are
kept we kidnaped the frogs women
so   

  why not their kids dolan laughed
we seem to be going in for crime in a
big way

  the young ones will have a better
chance for living to adulthood argued
masson were doing them a favor
and the frogs cant know whose children
are gone and whose are left

  sounds all right the way you put it
agreed dolan maybe because i want to
believe it but will the little brats have
brains enough to soak up education
im sure of it joe all they need is
opportunity

  so im to go back and get ten or twelve
other guys said dolan and well clean
out this frog nursery

  right ill stay here and watch the
whole procedure dont hurry back
maybe a week or so will be better
okay glade said the scarred giant
moving at a crouch along the low-roofed
way be seeing you

  a turn in the ascending tunnel smoth-
ered the last low-sopken words and masson
was left alone

  the blind men came into the cavern at
the direction of the wrinkled old hags
they carefully stripped away layer upon
layer of vegetation from the smallest and
brownest mound

  masson leaned further out over the
rim of the hole above the cavern floor to
watch he had feared that the party of
men from the crater would arrive before
he could see the uncovering of a mound
and the hatching of the frog eggs

  the last layer of thidin and grass came
away and perhaps a hundred of the leath-
	planet

ery bluish ovoids lay revealed on their
steaming warm nest they were shape-
less and limply alive now that leather-
hard outer shell rendered soft and rotten
by the steady warmth of the heating vege-
tation masson saw two tiny monsters
already free from their outgrown prisons
as the blind men began scooping them up
and carrying them to the empty pen beside
the ones already occupied

  the young butrads set up a throaty
hoarse bellowing that made the cave
vibrate it was not their feeding time
but the excitement had aroused them and
they knew but this one way to exress
their displeasure masson started to crawl
back from the passages outer lip even as
the two old females started throwing thidin
shoots and scraps of raw fish to the
screeching young ones

  and the rotten gray rock betrayed him
a dozen times in the past eight days he
had leaned out over the rim to watch
and a dozen times the rock had supported
his weight but this time it went scaling
away a great slab of it and with it went
the earthman

the blind men whirled from the half-
full pen and came lunging at him the
old females screeched throaty harsh orders
and masson raised the gun that he some-
how had managed to cling to

  go back he ordered in the language
of the butrads go out of the cave before
i kill

  he is but one croaked the ancient
ones destroy the desecrator of the place
of birth

  now masson could see that the eyes of
the four frog males had been neatly
gouged from their sockets in days past
probably they were blinded that they might
not see the forbidden magic of the eggs
that became frogs or perhaps they were
blinded that the might not escape from
the birth caves into the outer jungles

  yet in the semi-gloom of the cave they
were not at too great a disadvantage they
listened for the movement of massons
body and the breath of his lungs guided
them the young of the butrads were
silent too the sudden quiet was a roar
in his ears

  they closed in great chunks of stone
clenched in their fists a frog with

stories

but a club or a crude spear would have
been beaten but the puny hollow tube of
metal that the earthman carried held the
strength of many heavy clubs and many
huge rocks in its miniature pebbles of
shaped copper

  masson fired and a frog went down
the other three came on uncertainly and
he fired again the two remaining
butrads stopped

  there are many of them old ones
one of them cried they have struck
down trew and brun with thunder

  there is only one cried the wrinkled
old females kill him strike him
down

  do not listen to the old ones mas-
son warned i have captured the thunder
with it i strike you down

  the blind men hesitated and masson
sent a bullet smoking between their legs
they backed away toward the entrance
the females with them and a moment
later masson was piling fragments of
rock and crumbling shale into a barricade
before the caverns mouth

  he could hold them off for a time he
knew until night at least even though
they brought the guards from the outer
entrances to the bowl to aid the blind men

  again and again the guards had at-
tacked the cave where masson lay holed
up all that day they had come crawling
through the dense matted growth to launch
their arrows and spears at him fifty
or sixty of them there had been he esti-
mated and at least forty blood-hungry
butrads still faced him these were the
outer guards

  with the coming of night the blinded
workers of the caves would join them and
with their uncanny sense of hearing and
touch they would overrun the cave the
frogs were not a cowardly race and his
invasion into this their most taboo and
sacred place made them all the more
fanatical in their hatred

  masson had until night after that
unless he escaped back through the tun-
nel he would die and if he left the
young frogs behind he would never again
be able to raid this cavern already they
were hungry their throaty shrilled cries
beating at his droop-tipped ears

  perhaps the din from within dulled his
hearing for tough naked hide scraped
survival	

on rock and the heavy breathing of the
wounded blind man should have been
clearly audible otherwise masson must
have heard him approaching at the last
for he was half-turned when the rough
fragment of grayish shale came thudding
down he twisted away from the weighty
missile but even so it grazed along his
skull and he went down into the blackness
of nothingness for a time

  he awakened to look into the hot dark
eyes of a frog who had crept to within
a few paces of his barricade

 the rifle was yet in his grip and
through blinding flashes of pain he some-
how found the strength to aim and squeeze
trigger the ugly gray face vanished and
he painfully fed another cartridge into
the rifles single chamber the weight
across his back did not go away and
twisting his head he saw that the blind
butrads body had slumped across his own

  masson slid the weight off but the black-
ness came again so he rested for a time
and this time the blackness had come to
stay for it was night the sun had finally

been swallowed by the cloud layers that
swath venus eternally

  he tried to crawl back toward the tun-
nel but how he was to climb the sheer wall
to the escape passage he did not know he
could not raise his body from the ground
on the level

  once again the pain in his head returned
and pain flashed its lightning his eyes
clenched themselves shut and he fought off
the giddy waves of weakness after a
time he could feel again and see

  there was light in the cave light and
the grayish flabby-hided bodies of butrads
he tried to raise the rifle and a webbed
hand knocked it from his grasp

  none of that now a voice ordered
and his unbelieving ears recognized that
of joe dolan

  rifles cracked at the cave entrance and
he saw the larger young ones of the
butrads being hoisted up to the escape
tunnel and he grinned weakly up at
dolans hideous scarred face

  the future of the earthmen on the
watery world was safe now

ifalloway stared down at earth and his brain tore loose and
screamed man man bowd yon get in a mess like this in a rocket
a million miles past the moon shooting for mars and danger and

terror and maybe death

illustrated by doolin

oh my god do you realize how
far from earth we are do you
really think about it its enough
to scare the guts from a man hold me up
do something give me sedatives or hold
my hand or run call mama a million cold
miles up see all the flickering stars look
at my hands tremble feel my heart whirl-

  the captain comes toward me a stunned
expression on his small tight face he
takes my arm looking into my eyes hello
captain im sick if thats what you want
to know ive a right to be scared-just
look at all that space standing here a
moment ago i stared down at earth so
round and cloud-covered and asleep on a
mat of stars and my brain tore loose and
screamed man man howd you get in a
mess like this in a rocket a million miles
past the moon shooting for mars with a
crew of fourteen others i can hardly
stand up my knees my hands my heart
are shaking apart hold me up sir

  what are hysterics like the captain
unprongs the inter-deck audio and speaks
swiftly scowling into it i hope hes phon-
ing the psychiatrist i need something oh
dammit dammit

  the psychiatrist descends the ladder in
immaculate salt-white uniform and walks
toward me in a dream hello doctor
youre the one for me please sir turn
this damned rocket around and fly back to
new york ill go crazy with all this space
and distance

  the psychiatrist and the captains voices
murmur and blend with here and there an
emphasis a toss of head a gesture

  young halloway heres on a fear-jag
doctor can you help him



  ill try good man halloway is im-
agine youll need him and his muscles when
we land

  with the crew as small as it is every
mans worth his weight in uranium hes
got to be cured

  the psychiatrist shakes his head

  might have to squirt him full of drugs
to keep him quiet the rest of the expedi-
tion

  the captain explodes saying that is im-
possible blood drums in my head the
doctor moves closer smelling clean sharp
and white

  please understand captain this man is
definitely psychotic about going home his
talk is almost a reversion to childhood i
cant refuse his demands and his fear
seems too deeply based for reasoning how-
ever i think ive an idea halloway
yes sir help me doctor i want to go
home i want to see popcorn exploding
into a buttered avalanche inside a glass
cube i want to roller skate i want to
climb into the old cool wet ice-wagon and
go chikk-chikk-chikk on the ice with a
sharp pick i want to take long sweating
hikes in the country see big brick buildings
and bright-faced people fight the old gang
anything but this-awful

  the psychiatrist rubs his chin

  all right son you can go back to
earth now tonight

planet stories

matter what they tell you youre landing
on earth  no matter what happens
youll be on earth    everything you see
and do will be like on earth    remember
that    remember that    you wont be
afraid because youll be on earth  re-
member that    over and over    youll

face like that the captain comes rush-
ing up eyes hot green and angry

  doctor whats this infernal nonsense

  you wanted halloway able to do his
work didnt you captain

  yes but what in hellve you done to
him

  strange as they talk i hear their words
flow over my head like a wave dashed on
a sea-stone but the words drain off leav-
ing no imprint as soon as some words
invade my head something eats and di-
gests them and i think the words are some-
thing else entirely

  the psychiatrist nods at me

  i couldnt change his basic desire given

  time yes a period of months i could have
but you need him now so against all
the known ethics of my profession which
say one must never lie to a patient ive
followed along in his own thought chan-
nel i didnt dare frustrate him he wanted
to go home so i let him ive given him a
fantasy ive set up a protective defense
mechanism in his mind that refuses to
believe certain realities that evaluates all
things from its own desire for security and
home his mind will automatically bloc
any thought or image that endangers that
security

  the captain stares wildly

  then then halloways insane
would you have him mad with fear
or able to work on mars hindered by only
a slight tetched condition coddle him
and hell do fine just remember were
landing on earth not mars

 earth mars youll have me raving
next

talk weirdly who cares here comes

bage underfoot

flashing you the highlights on one of the
men youve met in preceding issues-those
cosmic-minded writers and artists who help to
nourish planet stories and the visigraph

world sweeper

   well you asked for it   

  my vital statistics are bom march  
and have been bothering folks ever since mar-
ried since  to lorraine but how she puts up
with me ill probably never know have four
very nice children but then im prejudiced we
call them the js jacqueline jeraldine james and
jon

  my life has been a full one and i hope will
continue to be so my positions have been inter-
esting covering many fields in the late twenties
and early thirties i spent some time touring the
country with tent shows called by the digni-
fied title of chatauqua

  the winter of - i spent touring the orient
with an orchestra playing spots in china japan
the philippines and on shipboard it was on this
trip that i became interested in my hobby-the
study of people and their philosophies

  for a time i taught school but the low pay
scale sent me back to my first love the theatre
i now work as a projectionist and indulge in my
hobby wherever i may find it i particularly en-
joy searching in dark corners where prejudice
and tradition have been broken down i enj 
reading the philosophies that dreamers put down
in the form of fantasy the world-sweeping ideas
that would shock the populace if unveiled in any
form other than fiction i deplore the many trivial
thoughts put down by mediocre writers with
frankly nothing but nerve and read by a gul-
lible public because its fashionable to read best
sellers

  in spring of  lorraine and i decided to
publish a newsletter to our friends in the ser-
vices it was this publication that brought us into
contact with science fiction fandom we soon
began doing fantasy fiction field for unger
contacted e everett evans president of the na-
tional fantasy fan federation and really began
to learn how much a hobby can be enjoyed by
sharing it with others

   activities in fan clubs publishing efforts corre-
 spondence with friendly editors like chet white-
 horn letters from other fans have taught us that
 merely reading and enjoying stf and fantasy is
 not enough we believe that we are now ap-
 proaching the ultimate satisfaction of our hobby
 fan life by activity in the national fantasy fan
 federation a general group open to all fans our
 local club in similar fashion fantasy amateur
 press association in which each fan specializes
 in some field and gives to all the benefits of his
 work and reading of the many amateur journals
 published by fans in the field such pleasure
 would not be possible for us were it not for the
 pro fields with such publications as our own

  halloway you so-and-so you did it
dark sleep wake up slow listen
-and halloway ran down that amphi-
theatre nonchalant as a high-school kid
jumping hurdles a big saffron martian
beast with a mouth so damn big it looked
like the rear end of a delivery truck lunged
forward square at halloway-

  whatd halloway do

  halloway jumped right inside the
monsters mouth-right inside 

  what happened then

  the animal looked dumbfounded it
tried to spit out then to top it all what did
halloway do i ask you i ask you what did
he do he drew forth his boy-scout blade
and went chikk-chikk-chikk all around the
bloody interior pretending like hes holed
up in an ice-wagon chipping himself off
pieces of ice

  no

  on my honor the monster after tak-

ing a bit of this chikk-chikk-chikk business
leaped around cavorting floundering
rocking tossing and then with a spout of
blood out popped halloway grinning like
a kid and on he ran dodging spears and
pretending they were pebbles leaping a
line of crouched warriors and saying
theyre a picket fence then he lifted ber-
man and trotted with him until he met a
three hundred pound martian wrestler
halloway supposed that it was the truant
officer and promptly kicked him in the
face then he knocked down another guy
working furiously at the buttons of a
paralysis machine which looked to hallo-
way like a pop-corn wagon after which
two gigantic black martian leopards at-
tacked resembling to him nothing more
than two very bad drivers in dark automo-
biles halloway sidestepped the two
cars crashed and tore each other apart
fighting halloway pumped on shooting
people with his flashlight which he re-
trieved from the popcorn man pointing
the flash at people he was amazed when
they vanished and-oh oh halloways
waking up i saw his eyelids flicker quiet
everyone halloway you awake

 what hath me

by henry kuttner

the thousand tiny eyes raced past him glittering with alien ecstasy
shining brighter ever brighter as they fed he felt the lifeblood
being sucked out of him-deeper stabbed the gelid cold-louder
roared the throbbing in his ears  then the voice came the
heart off the watcher crush the heart

illustrated by hollingsworth

the- man running through the forest
gloom breathed in hot panting gusts
pain tearing at his chest underfoot
the crawling pale network of tree-trunks
lay flat upon the ground and more than
once he tripped over a slippery bole and
crashed down but he was up again in-
stantly

  he had no breath to scream he sobbed
as he ran his burning eyes trying to pierce
the shadows whispers rustled down from
above when the leaf-ceiling parted a
blaze of terribly bright stars flamed in the
jet sky it was cold and dark and the man
knew that he was not on earth

  they were following him even here

  a squat yellow figure huge-eyed in-
human loomed in his path-one of the
swamp people of southern venus the
man swung a wild blow at the thing and
his fist found nothing it had vanished
but beyond it rose a single-legged giant a
martian bellowing the great gusty laugh-
ter of the redland tribes the man
dodged stumbled and smashed down
heavily he heard paddling footsteps and
tried with horrible intensity of purpose to
rise he could not

  the martian crept toward him-but it
was no longer a martian an earthman
with the face of some obscene devil came
forward with a sidling slow motion horns
sprouted from the low forehead the teeth
were fangs as the creature came nearer
it raised its hands-twisted gnarled talons
-and slid them about the mans throat

  through the forest thundered the deep
booming clangor a brass gong the sound
shattered the phantom as a hammer shat-
ters glass instantly the man was alone

  making hoarse animal sounds in his



throat he staggered upright and lurched in
the direction from which the sound came
but he was too weak presently he fell and
this time he did not rise his arms moved
a little and then were still he slept lines
of tortured weariness twisting the haggard
face

  very faintly from infinite distances he
heard a voice    two voices inhuman
alien-and yet with a warmth of vital
urgency that stirred something deep within
him

  he has passed our testing

  then a stronger more powerful voice
-answering

  others have passed our testing-but
the aesir slew them

  there is no other way in this man i
sensed something-a little different he
can hate-he has hated

  he will need more than hatred- the
deeper voice said even with us to aid
him and there is little time strip his
memories from him now so that he may
not be weakened by them-

  may the gods fight with him

  but he fights the gods the only gods
men know in these evil days-

  the man awakened

  triphammers beat ringingly inside his
skull he opened his eyes and closed them
quickly against the sullen red glow that beat
down from above he lay motionless gath-
ering his strength

  what had happened

  he didnt know the jolting impact of
that realization struck him violently he felt
a brief panic of disorientation where-

  im derek stuart he thought at least
it isnt complete amnesia i know who i
am but not where i am



planet

stories

  this time when he opened his eyes they
stayed open overhead a broad-leafed tree
arched through its branches he could see
a dark starry sky the glowing ringed disc
of saturn very far away and a deeply scar-
let glow

  not earth then a saturnian moon
no saturn didnt eclipse most of the sky
perhaps the asteroid belt

  he moved his head a little and saw the
red moon

  aesir

  the message rippled along his nerves
into his brain stuart reacted instantly
his hard strong body writhed whipped
over and then he was in a half-croucli one
hand flashing to his belt while his eyes
searched the empty silence of the forest
around him there was no sound no
movement

sweat stood on stuarts forehead and
he brushed it away impatiently his
deeply-tanned face set into harsh lines of
curiously hopeless desperation there was
no blaster gun at his belt that didnt mat-
ter guns couldnt help him now-on
asgard

  the red moon had told him the answer
only one world in the system had a red
moon and men didnt go to that artificial
asteroid willingly they went yes-but
only to be doomed and damned from
venus to callisto spacemen spoke of as-
gard in hushed voices-asgard where the
aesir lived and ryled the worlds of man

  no spaceships left asgard except the
sleek black cruisers manned by the priests
of aesir no man had ever returned from
asgard

  stuart grinned mirthlessly hed learned
a lesson though hed never profit by it now
always before hed been confident of his
ability to outdrink anyone of his own
weight and size and certainly that slight
tired-eyed man at the singing star in new
boston should have passed out long before
stuart-under normal circumstances

  so the circumstances hadnt been quite
normal it was a frame a beautiful air-
tight frame because hed never come back
to squawk nobody came back from as-
gard

  he shivered a little and looked up war-
ily there were legends of course the
watchers who patrolled the asteroid cease-

lessly-robots men said they served the
aesir as in a way all men served the
aesir

  no sound no movement only the sul-
len crimson light beating down ominously
from that dark sky

  stuart took stock of his clothing regu-
lar leatheroid spacemans rig theyd left
him that anyway whoever they were
he couldnt remember anything that had
happened after the fifth drink with the
tired-eyed man there was a very faint
recollection of running somewhere-seeing
unpleasant things-and hearing two oddly
unreal voices but the memories slipped
away and vanished as he tried to focus on
them

  the hell with it he was an asgard
and that meant-something rather more
unpleasant than death if the legends were
to be believed a very suitable climax to
an unorthodox life in this era when obe-
dience and law enforcement were the rigid
rule

  stuart picked up a heavy branch that
might serve as a club then shrugging he
turned westward striking at random
through the forest no use waiting here
till the watchers came at least-he could
fight as he had always fought as far back
as he could remember

  there wasnt much room for fighters any
more not under the aesir rule there
were nations and kings and presidents of
course but they were puppet figures never
daring to disobey any edicts that came from
the mystery-shrouded asteroid hanging off
the orbit of mars the tiny artificial world
that had ruled the system for a thousand
years

  the aesir the inhuman cryptic beings
who-if legend were true-once had been
human stuart scowled trying to remem-
ber

  an-an entropic accelerator that was it
a device a method that speeded up evolu-
tion tremendously that had been the start
of the tyranny a machine that could ac-
celerate a mans evolution by a million
ears-

  some had used that method those
were the ones who had become the aesir
creatures so far advanced in the evolution-
ary scale that they were no longer re-
motely human much was lost in-the mists
of the past but stuart could recall that
what hath me	

much-the knowledge that the aesir had
once been human that they were human
no longer and that for a thousand years
they had ruled the system very terribly
from their forbidden asteroid that they
named asgard-home of the legendary
norse gods

  maybe the tired-eyed man had been an
aesir priest collecting victims certainly
no others would have dared to land a ship
on asgard stuart swung on searching
the empty skies and now a queer un-
reasoning excitement began to grow within
him at least before he died hed learn
what the aesir were like it probably
wouldnt be pleasant knowledge but thered
be some satisfaction in it and thered be
even more satisfaction if he thought he
had a chance of smashing a hard fist into
the face of one of the aesir priests-or
even-

  hell why not he had nothing to lose
now from the moment he had touched
asgard soil he was damned anyway but
of one thing stuart was certain he
wouldnt be led like a helpless sheep to the
throat-cutting he wouldnt die without
fighting against them

  the forest thinnned before him there
was a flicker of swift motion far ahead
stuart froze his grip tightening on the
cudgel his eyes searching

  between the columnar trees bright amid
the purple shadows a glitter of sparkling
nebulae swept a web of light stuart
thought-so dazzling his eyes ached as he
stared at the-the thing

  bodiless intangible the shifting net of
stars poised high above his head hun-
dreds of twinkling glittering pinpoints
flickered there so swiftly it seemed as
though an arabesque spider-web of light
weaved in the still dark air-web of the
norns

  each flickering star-fleck-watched each
was an eye

  and as the thing poised a horrible half-
human hesitancy in its stillness a deep
humming note sounded from its starry
heart

  star-points shook and quivered to the
sound again it came-deeper more
menacing

  questioning

  was this one of the-watchers was
this one of them

abruptly its hesitancy vanished it
swept down upon stuart instinc-
tively he swung his cudgel in a smashing
blow that sent him reeling forward-for
there was no resistance the star-creature
was as intangible as air

  and yet it was not the dazzling web
of light enfolded him like a blazing cloak
instantly a cold trembling horror crawled
along his skin bodiless the thing might
be-but it was dangerous infinitely so

  pressure shifting quicksand pressure
was all about him that stealthy cold
crept into his flesh and bones frigid icicles
jabbing into his brain gasping with
shock stuart struck out he had dropped
the club now he stooped and groped for
it but he could see nothing except a glit-
tering veil of diamonds that raced like a
mad torrent everywhere

  the humming rose again-ominously
triumphant

  cursing stuart staggered forward the
star-cloak stayed he tried to grip it
somewhere to wrench it free but he could
not the thousands of tiny eyes raced
past him -glittering with alien ecstasy
shining brighter and ever brighter as they
fed

  he felt the life being sucked out of
him    deeper stabbed the gelid cold
   louder roared that throbbing tone in
his ears

  he heard his voice gasping furious
hopeless oaths his eyes ached with the
strain of staring at that blinding glitter
then-

  the heart of the watcher crush the
heart

  the words crashed like deep thunder in
his brain had someone spoken them-
no    for with the command had come
a message as well as though a thought
had spoken within his mind a telepathic
warning from-where

  his eyes strained at the dazzle now he
saw that there was a brighter core that did
not shift and change when the rest of the
star-cloud wove its dreadful net a spot of
light that-

  he reached out    the nucleus darted
away  he lurched forward on legs half-
frozen and felt a stone turn under his
foot as he crashed down his hand closed
and tightened on something warm and liv-
ing that pulsed frantically against his palm


planet

stories

   the humming rose to a shrill scream   
frightened    warning

  stuart tightened his grip he lay mo-
tionless his eyes closed but all around
him he could feel the icy tendrils of the
star-thing lashing at him drinking his
human warmth probing with avid fingers
at his brain

  he felt that warm-core-writhe and
try to slip between his fingers he
squeezed   

  the scream burst out an inhuman agony
in its raw-edged keening

   it stopped

  in stuarts hand was-nothing

  he opened his eyes the dazzling glit-
ter of star-points had vanished only the
forest with its purple shadows lay empty
and silent around him

  stuart got up slowly swallowed dry-
throated the creatures of the aesir were
not invulnerable then not to one who
knew their weaknesses

  how had he known

  what voice had spoken in his brain
there had been an odd impossible fa-
miliarity to that-that mental voice now
that he remembered it somewhere he had
heard it sensed it before

  that gap in his memory-

   he tried to bridge it but he could not
there was only a quickening of the desire
to go on westward he felt suddenly cer-
tain that he would find the aesir in that
direction

  he took a hesitant step-and another
and with each step a queer unmotivated
confidence poured into him as though
some barrier in his mind had broken down
letting some strange flood of proud de-
fiance rush in

  it was impossible it was dangerous
but-certainly-no more dangerous than
supinely waiting here on asgard till an-
other watcher came to destroy him there
were worse things than the starry watch-
ers here if legends were to be trusted

   he went on the curious tide of defiance
rising higher and ever higher in his blood
it was a strangely intoxicating sense of
-of pure crazy self-confidence such as no
man should rightfully have felt on this
haunted asteroid

  he wondered-but the drunkenness
was such that he did not wonder much
he did not question

  he thought to hell with the aesir

  the forest ended at his feet a road
began leading off into the purple horizons
of the flat plain before him at the end of
that road was a thrusting pillar of light
that rose like a tower toward the dark sky

   there were the aesir

every spaceman has an automatic
sense of orientation in ancient days
when clipper ships sailed the seas of earth
the yankee skippers knew the decks be-
neath their feet and they knew the stars
southern cross or pole star told them in
what latitudes they sailed in unknown
waters they still had their familiar keels
and the familiar stars

  so it is with the spacemen who drift
from pluto to mercury darkside trusting
to metal hulls that shut in the air and shut
out the vast abysses of interplanetary space
when thej work outship a glance at the
sky will tell a trained man where he is-
and only tough trained men survive the
dangerous commerce of space on mercury
the blazing solar corona flames above the
horizon on clouded venus the green star
of earth shines sometimes on io callisto
ganymede a man can orient himself by the
gigantic mother planet-saturn or jupiter
-and in the asteroid belt there is always
the strange procession of little worlds like
lanterns some half-shadowed others
brightly reflecting the suns glare any-
where in the system the sky is friendly-

  except on asgard jupiter was too far
and too small mars was scarcely visible
the asteroid belt not much thicker than
the milky way the unfamiliar magni-
tudes of the planets told stuart very
surely that he was on unknown territory
he was without the sure safe anchor that
spacemen depend upon and that lack told
him how utterly he stood alone now

  but the unreasoning confidence did not
flag if anything it mounted stronger
within him as he hurried along the road
his rangy legs eating up the miles with easy
speed the sooner he reached his goal the
better hed like it nor did he wish to en-
counter any more of the aesirs guardians
-his business was with the aesir

  the tower of light grew taller as he
went on now he saw that it was a cluster
wei at hath me	

of buildings massed cylinders of varying
heights each one gigantic in diameter as
well as height and all shining with that
cold shadowless radiance that apparently
came from the stone-or metal-itself the
road led directly to the base of the tallest
tower

  it ran between shining pillars-a gate-
less threshold-and was lost in silvery
mists no bars were needed to keep visitors
out of this fortress

  briefly a cool wind of doubt blew upon
stuart he hesitated wishing he had at
least his blaster gun but he was unarmed
he had even left the club back in the
forest

  he glanced around

  the red moon was sinking a heavier
darkness was creeping over the land very
far away he thought he saw the shifting
flicker of dancing lights-a watcher

  he hurried onward

  cyclopean the tower loomed above him
like a shining rod poised to strike his
gaze could not pierce the mists beyond
the portal

  he stepped forward-between the twin
pillars he walked on blindly into the sil-
ver mists

  twenty steps he took-and paused as
something dark and shapeless swam into
view before him a pit-at his feet

  in the dimness he could not see its bot-
tom but a narrow bridge crossed the gulf
a little to his left stuart crossed the bridge
solidity was again under his feet

 with shocking suddenness a great
brazen bellow of laughter roared out
harsh mockery sharpened it and it was
echoed

  all around stuart the laughter thun-
dered-and was answered the walls gave
it back and echoed it the bellowing laugh-
ter of gods deafened stuart

 the mists drifted away-were sucked
down into the pit they vanished

 as though they fled from that evil
laughter

  stuart stood in a chamber that must
have occupied the entire base of that
enormous tower behind him the abyss
gaped before him a shifting veil of light
hid whatever lay behind it but all around
between monstrous pillars were set
thrones ebon thrones fifty feet tall

  on the thrones sat giants

  titan figures armored in glittering mail
ringed stuart and instantly his mind fled
back to half-forgotten folk-lore  asgard
jotunheim the lands of the giants and the
gods thor and odin sly loki and baldur
-they were all here he thought bearded
colossi roaring their black laughter into the
shaking air of the hall

  watching him from their height-
then he looked up and the giants were
dwarfed

  the chamber was roofless at least he
could see no roof the pillars climbed up
and up tremendously all around the walls
that were hung with vast stretches of
tapestry till they dwindled to a pinpoint
far above the sheer magnitude of the
tower made stuarts mind rock dizzily

  still the laughter roared out but now
it died   

  thundered through the hall a voice   
deep    resonant    the voice of the
aesir

  a human brother

  aye a human-and a mad one to
come here

  to enter the hall of the aesir

  a red-bearded colossus bent down his
glacial blue eyes staring at stuart shall
i crush him

stuart sprang back as an immense
hand swooped down like a falling tree
upon him instinctively his hand flashed
to his belt and suddenly the red-beard was
shouting laughter that the others echoed
he has courage

  let him live

  aye let him live he may amuse us
for a while 

  and then

  then the pit-with the others

  the others stuart slanted a glance
downward the silver mists had dissi-
pated now and he could see that the abyess
was not bottomless its floor was fifty
feet below the surface on which he stood
and a dozen figures were visible beneath

  they stood motionless-like statues a
burly leather-clad earthmen who might
have been whisked from some plutonian
mine a slim scantily clad earthgirl her
hair powered blue her costume the shin-
ing sequin-suit of a tavern entertainer
a stocky hunch-shouldered venusian with
his slate-gray skin a martian girl seven
	planet

feet tall with limbs and features of curious
delicacy her hair piled high atop that nar-
row skull another earthman-a thin
pale clerklike fellow a white-skinned
handsome callistan native looking like
apollo and like all callistans harboring
the cold savagery of a demon behind that
smooth mask

  a dozen of them-drawn from all parts
of the system stuart remembered that
this was the time of the periodic tithing
-which meant nothing less than a sacrifice
once each month a few men and women
would vanish-not many-and the black
ships of the aesir priests sped back to
asgard with their captives

  not one looked up frozen motionless
as stone they stood there in the pit-wait-
ing

  again the laughter crashed out the
redbeard was watching stuart

  his courage flags the great voice
boomed speak the truth earthman
have you courage to face the gods

  stuart stubbornly refused to answer he
had an odd reasonless impression that this
was part of some deep game that behind
the mocking by-play lay a more serious
purpose

  he has courage now a giant said
but did he always have courage has
there never been a time in his life when
courage failed him answer earthman

  stuart was listening to another voice a
quiet infinitely distant voice within his
brain that whispered do not anstver them

  let him pass our testing the redbeard
commanded if he fails there is an end
if he does not fail-he goes into the pit
to walk the long orbit

  the giant leaned forward

  will you match skill-and courage-
with us earthling

  still stuart did not answer more than
ever now he sensed the violent hidden
undercurrents surging beneath the surface
of this byplay more than he knew swung
in the balance here

  he nodded

  he has courage a giant repeated
but did he always have courage

  we shall see  the redbeard said

  the air shimmered before stuart
through its shaking his senses played him
false he knew quite well who he was
and where he stood in what deadly peril

stories

-but in that shimmer which bewildered
the eyes and the mind he was a boy again
seeing a certain hillside he had not seen
except through his boyhoods eyes and
he saw a black horse standing above him
on the slope pawing the ground and look-
ing at him with red eyes and an old
old terror came flooding over him that
he had not remembered for a quarter of
a century a boys acute and sudden
terror   

  who had opened the doors of his mind
and laid this secret bare he himself had
long forgotten-and who upon this alien
world could look back through space and
time to remind him of that long-ago day
when the vicious black horse had thrown an
inexperienced boy rider and planted a seed
of terror in his mind which he had been
years outgrowing but the fear was long
gone now long gone    was it

  then whence had come this monstrous
black stallion that pawed the floor of the
hall glaring down red-eyed at him and
showing teeth like fangs no horse but
a monster in the shape of a horse a mon-
ster ten feet high at the shoulder wear-
ing the shape of his boyhood nightmare
that woke in stuart even now the old
unreasoning horror   

  it was stamping down upon him shak-
ing its bridled head snorting lifting its
lip above the impossible teeth he saw
the reins hanging loose he saw the sad-
dle and the swinging stirrups he knew
that the only safety in this hall for him
was paradoxically upon the nightmares
back where the hoofs and fangs could not
reach him but the terror and revulsion
which the boy had buried long ago came
welling up from founts deep-buried in the
mans subconscious mind   

now it was rushing him head like
a snakes outthrust hissing like a
snake reins flying like medusa-locks as
it stretched to seize him for one instant
he stood there paralyzed he had faced
dangers on many worlds to which this
nightmare was nothing but he had never
since boyhood felt the paralysis of horror
that gripped him now it was a childs
horror resurrected from the caves of sleep
to ruin him   

  with a superhuman effort he broke that
frozen fear snatching for the flying reins
whirling as the monstrous thing swept past
him in a thunder of terrifying hoofs des-
perately he clung to the reins and as the
thing rushed by he somehow got a clutch-
ing hand upon the saddle-horn and found
a stirrup that swung sickeningly when it
took his weight

  then he was in the saddle dizzy still
with the terrors of childhood but astride
the nightmare

  and now with a sudden intoxicating
clarity the fear fell from his mind for
an instant he sat high on the back of the
incredible fanged thing an old old terror
clearing from his mind confidence which
was he knew his own and no bodiless
reassurance drawn from dreams such as

he had felt in the jungle flooded warmly
through him he was not afraid any
more-he would never be afraid the
festering terror buried deep in his child-
hood had come to light at last and was
wiped away he caught the reins tight
and flashed a sudden grin around the hall-
brazen laughter boomed through the
building and beneath his knees stuart
felt the horses body alter incredibly one
moment he was gripping a solid warm-
fleshed hairy thing whose body had a
familiar pitch and motion beneath the sad-
dle then then-

  indescribably the body writhed under
him the warm hairy flesh flowed and
changed cold struck through leatheroid
	planet

against his thighs and it was a smooth
pouring cold of many alien muscles work-
ing powerfully together in a way no mam-
mal knows he looked down 

  he was riding a monstrous snake that
twisted its head to look at him in the mo-
ment he realized what had happened its
great diamond-shaped head towered high
and came looping down toward him wide-
mouthed tongue like a flame flicker-
ing   

  it laid its cold smooth cheek against
his with a hideous caressing motion slid-
ing around his neck sliding down his arm
and side laying a loop of cold scaly
strength around him and pressing press-
ing   

  his hands closed around the thickness
of its throat futilely-and the throat melted
in his grasp and was hairly with a hairiness
no mammal ever knew the motion of
the body he bestrode changed again and
was incredibly springy and light

  he rode a monstrous spider his hands
were sunk wrist-deep in loathsome coarse
hair and his eyes stared into great cold
faceted eyes that mirrored his own face
a thousandfold he saw his own dis-
torted features looking back at him in
countless miniatures but behind the faces
in the great eyes of the spider he saw no
consciousness regarding him the cold
multiple eyes were not aware of derek
stuart behind the shield of its terrible
face the spider shut away its own arach-
nid thoughts and the memories of the red
fields of mars that were its home with
dreadful impersonal aloofness its mandi-
bles gaped forward toward its prey

  loathing ran in waves of weakness
through stuarts whole body but he shut
his eyes and blindly struck out at the nearer
of those great mirroring eyes feeling wet-
ness shatter against his fist as-as-

  as the horror shifted and vanished while
rippling waves of green light darkened all
about him now they coagulated drew to-
gether into a meadow cool with earthly
grass bordered by familiar trees far away
primroses gleamed here and there above
him was the blue sky and the warm bright
sun that shone only upon the hills of earth

  but what he felt was horror

  twenty feet from him was a rank round-
ed patch of weeds his gaze was drawn in-
exorably to that spot and it was from

stories

there that the crawling dread reached out to
him

  faintly he heard laughter  of the gods
 of the aesir the aesir  who-what
were they how had he derek stuart
ever heard of them except as a name whis-
pered in fear as the spaceships streaked
through the clouds above that dakota farm-
stead   

  derek stuart  a boy of eleven   

  but-but-that was wrong somehow he
wasnt a child any more he had matured
become a spaceman-

  dreams the dreams of an eleven-year-
old

  yet the hollow dreadful laughter
throbbed somewhere in the vaults of the
blue overhead in the solidity of the very
ground beneath him

  this had happened before it had hap-
pened to a boy in south dakota-a boy
who had not known what lay concealed in
that verdant clump of weeds

  but now somehow-and very strangely
-stuart knew what he would find there

  he was afraid horribly sickeningly
afraid cold nausea crawled up his spine
and the calves of his legs he wanted to
turn and run to the farmhouse half a mile
away he almost turned and then paused
as the distant laughter grew louder

  they wanted him to run they were
trying to scare him-and once the de-
fenses of his courage had broken he would
be lost stuart knew that with an icy cer-
tainty

  somewhere very far away he sensed a
man standing in a cyclopean hall-a man
in ragged spacemans garb hard-faced
thin-lipped angry-eyed a familiar figure
the man was urging him on-telling him
to go on toward that clump of weeds-

  derek stuart obeyed the voiceless com-
mand his throat dry his heart pumping
he forced himself across the meadow till
he stood at his goal and looked down at the
bloody twisted corpse of the tramp who
had been knifed by another hobo twenty
years before on that dakota farm the
old nausea of shocked horror took him by
the throat and strangled him

  he fought it down this time he didnt
run screaming back to the farmhouse   

  and suddenly the laughter of the gods
was stilled derek stuart a man once more
in mind stood again in the tower of the
what hath me	

aesir the thrones between the monstrous
pillars were vacant

  the aesir were gone

    ill

stuart let out his breath in a long sigh
he had no illusions about the vanish-
ment of the aesir he knew he had not con-
quered those mighty beings it would take
more than human powers to do that but
at least he had a respite all but the most
stolid spacemen develop hypertension and
there seems to be a curious mathematical
rule about that it increases according to
the distance from the sun which may
be explained by the fact that environmental
differences also increase as the outer planets
are reached--and alien environments breed
alien creatures a great many men have
gone insane on pluto   

  this was not pluto it was nearer sun-
ward than jupiter but the utter alienage
that brooded over asgard was almost
palpable even the solidity under stuarts
feet the very stones of the planetoid were
artifically created by a science a million
years beyond that of his own time and
the aesir-

  unexpectedly his deep chest shook with
laughter the inexplicable self-confidence
that had first come to him in the asgard
forests had not waned it seemed to have
grown even stronger since his meeting with
the aesir giants- now he stared around
the colossal hall his eyes straining toward
the spot of light far above where those
incredible columns converged his own
insignificance by comparison did not trouble
him

  whether or not he could have the slight-
est hope of winning this game-at least he
was giving his enemies a run for their
money

 a sound from the pit roused him
stuart walked warily toward the edge
the dozen motionless figures were still
there fifty feet below and among them
was one he had not noticed before-an
earthgirl he thought with curling dark
hair framing a white face as she tilted up
her chin and stared at him

  at this distance he could make out few
details she wore a close-fitting green suit
which left slender arms and legs bare

  earthman- she said in a clear carry-

ing voice earthman quick the
aesir will be back-go now leave their
temple before they-

  dont waste your breath stuart said
this is asgard whoever the girl was
she should know the impossibility of leav-
ing the taboo world if i can find a
rope-

  she said quickly you wont find one
not here in the temple

  how can i get you out of there and
the others

  youre mad the girl said what
good would it do   she shook her
head better to die at once

  stuart narrowed his eyes at the dozen
frozen figures i dont think so four-
teen of us can put up a better fight than
one if your friends wake up-

  the girl said on your left between
the pillars theres a tapestry showing
perseus and the gorgon touch the helm
of perseus and the hand of andromeda
then go carefully-there may be traps
what is it

  it will lead you down here you can
free us if you hurry-oh but its hopeless
the aesir-

  damn the aesir stuart snarled
wake up the others he whirled and
ran toward the distant wall whexe he
could see the perseus tapestry brown and
gold a huge curtain between two columns
if the aesir saw they made no move   
stuarts lips twisted in a bitter smile
the crazy confidence had not left him
but he was conscious of a reassuring
warmth at least he was no longer com-
pletely alone that would help between
the worlds and on the desolate planets
that swing along the edge of the system
loneliness is the lurking terror more hor-
rible than the most exotic monster ever
spawned by the radioactive plutonian earth

  he touched the tapestry twice it swept
away from him and a staircase was visible
leading down through stone or metal-he
could not tell which stuart fought back
the impulse that urged him to race down
those curving spiral steps the girl had
spoken of traps

  he went warily testing each tread be-
fore he put his weight upon it though
he did not think that the snares of the
aesir would be so simple

  at the bottom he emerged into a vaulted
	planet

chamber tiny by comparison with the one
he had left it was oval domed ceiling
and walls and floor shining with a milky
radiance-except at one spot

  there he saw a door-transparent
through it he looked into the pit he
was on a level with the floor of that shaft
now he could see the dozen figures still
standing motionless in a huddled group
and a few feet beyond the glassy pane
was the earthgirl she was looking di-
rectly at him but her dark eyes had a blind
seeking as though the door was opaque
from her side

  stuart paused his hand on the compli-
cated mechanism that he guessed would
open the portal his hard dark face was
impassive but he was conscious of an un-
familiar stirring deep within him from
above he had not seen the girls beauty

  he saw it now

she couldnt be an earthgirl-entirely
she must be one of those disturbingly
lovely interplanetary halfbreeds earth-
blood she had of course and predomi-
nantly but there was something more the
pure essence of beauty that blazed through
her like a flame kindled in a lamp of
crystal in all his wanderings between the
worlds stuart had never seen a girl as
breathtakingly lovely as this one

  his hand moved on the controls the
door slid silently open the girls eyes
brightened she gave a little gasp and ran
toward him without question she sought
refuge in his arms and for a moment
stuart held her-not unwillingly

  he thrust her away gently

  the others

  she said its useless the paralysis-

  stuart scowled and stepped across the
threshold into the pit uneasiness crawled
along his spine as he did so the aesir
might be watching from above or-or-

  there was nothing only dead silence
and the uneven breathing of the girl as
she stood in the doorway watching stuart
stopped before the leather-clad earthman
and tested a burly arm the man stood
frozen his flesh cold and hard as stone his
eyes staring glassily he was not even
breathing

  so with the others stuart grimaced
and shrugged he turned back toward
the girl and felt a pulse of relief as he

stories

stepped into the shining chamber he
might be no safer here but at least he
wasnt so conscious of inhuman eyes that
might be watching from above not that
solid stone might be any barrier to the
aesirs probing gaze   

  the girl touched the mechanism the
door slid silently shut its no use she
said the paralysis holds all the others
only i could battle it-a little and that
was because-

  save it stuart said he turned toward
the door by which he had entered but an
urgent hand gripped his wrist

  let me talk the quiet voice said
were as safe here as anywhere and
there may be a way-now that i can think
clearly again

  a way out a safe way

  there was a haunted look in her dark
eyes i dont know ive lived here
for a long time the others- she pointed
toward the door of the pit the sacrifices
were brought to asgard only yesterday
but ive been here many moons the
aesir kept me alive for a bit to amuse
them then they tired and i was thrown
in with the others but i learned a little
i-i-no one can dwell here in the aesir
stronghold without-changing a little
thats why the paralysis didnt hold me
as long as it holds the others

  can we save them

  i dont know she said with a small
helpless shrug i dont even know if
we can save ourselves its been so long
since i was brought to asgard that i-i
scarcely remember my life before that
but i have learned a little of the aesir-
and that may help us now

  stuart watched her she tried to smile
but not successfully

  she said im kari the rest-ive
forgotten youre-

  derek stuart

  tell me what happened

  we havent time stuart said impa-
tiently but kari shook her head

well need weapons and i must know
-first-if you can use them tell me
well she was right she had knowledge
that stuart needed so he told her very
briefly what he remembered

  she stared at him voices-in your
mind 

  something like that i dont know-
what hath me	

 no no or-wait- he tried to
focus his thoughts upon a far faint call-
ing that came from infinite distances his
name an urgent summons-

  it faded and was gone

  theres nothing stuart said finally
and kari moved her shoulders uneasily
no help there then

  tell me one thing whats the aesirs
power  hypnotism 

  no kari said or not entirely they
can make thoughts into real things they
are-what the race of man will evolve
into in a million years and they have
changed into beings utterly alien to
humans

  they looked human-giants though
they can assume any shape kari
told him their real form is unimagin-
able being of pure energy    mental
force    matrixes of electronic power
they were striking at you through your
mind

  stuart said i wondered why they didnt
set some of their watchers on me

  i dont know why they didnt kari
frowned instead they hammered at
your weaknesses-old fears that hung on
to you for years experiences that fright-
ened you in the past they sent your mind
back into that past-but you were too
strong for them

 too strong-

  then they have other powers stuart
-incredible powers you cant fight them
alone and you must fight them in a
thousand years no one has dared-

 stuart remembered something two
dared-once

kari nodded i know i know the
legends anyway about john starr
and lorna the great rebels who first
defied the aesir when the tyranny began
but they may have been only legendary
figures even if they were real-they
failed

  yes they failed and theyre a thou-
sand years dead but it shows something
-to me at least man wasnt meant to be
a slave to these monsters rebellion-
kari watched him stuarts eyes were
shadowed

  john starr and lorna he whispered
i wonder what their world was like a
thousand years ago weve got all the

worlds now all the planets of the system
from jupiter to the smallest asteroid but
we dont rule them as men owned their
own earth in those days were slaves
to the aesir

  the aesir are-are gods

  john starr didnt think so stuart
said neither do i and at worst i
can always die as he did listen kari
he gripped her arms think youve
lived here for a while is there any weapon
against those devils

  she met his gaze steadily yes she
said but-

  what is it where

  abruptly karis face changed she
pressed herself against stuart avoiding
his lips simply seeking-he knew-warmth
and companionship she was crying softly

  so long- kari whispered her arms
tight around him ive been here so long
-with the gods and im so lonely derek
stuart so lonely for green fields and fires
and the blue sky i wish-

  youll see earth again stuart prom-
ised at that kari pulled away her strange
half-breed loveliness was never more real
than then with tears sparkling on her dark
lashes and her mouth trembling

  she said a catch in her voice ill show
you the weapon stuart

  she turned toward the wall her hand
moved in a quick gesture a panel opened
there in the glowing surface

  kari reached in and when she withdrew
her arm it was as though she held a torrent
of blood that poured down from her grip
it was a cloak stuart saw made of some
material so fine that it rippled like water
its crimson violence was bizarre against
the cool green of karis garment

  this cloak- she said you must
wear it if we face the aesir

  stuart grimaced what good is a piece
of cloth  a blaster guns what i want

  a blaster wouldnt help kari said
this is more than a piece of cloth stuart
it is half alive-made so by the sciences
of the aesir wear it it will protect you
she swung the great scarlet billows
about stuarts shoulders her fingers
fumbled with the clasp at his throat and
then-

  she lies

  the desperate urgency of the thought
roared through stuarts mind he knew


planet

stories

that soundless voice so sharp now with
violent intensity his hands came up to
rip the cloak from him-

  he was too late kari sprang back
wide-eyed as the fastenings of the cloak
tightened like a noose about stuarts neck
he felt a stinging shock that ran like white
fire along his spine and up into his brain
one instant of blazing disorientation a
hopeless despairing cry in his mind-a
double cry as of two telepathetic voices
-and then his muscles too weak to hold
him he crashed down upon the floor

  it was not paralysis he was simply
drained of all strength there was pres-
sure about his throat cold flames along his
spine and in his brain and he could feel
the texture of the cloak wrapped about
him striking through his spacemans garb
-tingling sentient half-alive

  he whispered an oath karis face had
not changed he read something strangely
like pity in her dark eyes

  from the gap in the wall whence she
had drawn the cloak came a figure cloaked
in black a jet cowl hiding its head and
face completely it was taller than the
girl by a foot it shuffled forward with
an odd rocking gait and paused near her

  stuart whispered i-should have re-
membered the-the aesir can change
their shapes those giants i saw werent
real and neither are you-not even hu-
man 

  kari shook her head i am real she
said slowly he is not she gestured
toward the black-cloaked figure but we
are all of the aesir and as we thought
you were sent by the protectors now your
power is gone and you must walk the long
orbit with the other captives

  the cowled creature came forward it
bent but stuart could see nothing in the
shadow of the hood a fold of cloth
writhed out and touched stuarts forehead

  darkness wrapped him like the shroud
of the scarlet cloak

iv

for a long time he had only his thoughts
for company they were not pleasant
he felt alone as he had never felt so
utterly lonely and deserted before any-
where in the system now he realized that
even since his landing on asgard he had

had companionship of a sort-that the twin
voices murmuring in his brain had been
more real than he had realized a living
warmth a sense of-of presence-had been
with him then

  but it was gone now its absence left
a black void within him he stood alone

  and kari  if he saw her again
when his hands were free he would kill
her he knew that but-but her shin-
ing smile lightened the darkness that en-
gulfed him now he had never seen love-
liness like karis and he had known so
many women so many too many  a
man who has fought his way sunward and
back again by way of plutos chasmed
midnight is not so easily misled by the
smile of a pretty woman

  kari was no ordinary woman-god
knew she was not perhaps not even hu-
man perhaps not even real at all it
might be that very touch of alienage that had
stamped her shining image upon his memory
but he could not put the image aside now
he saw her clearly in the darkness of his
captivity and the deeper dark of his lone-
liness now that the voices were stilled
lovely exotic with the eyes full of longing
and terror-what lies they told-and that
lovely that dazzling smile

  bitterness made a wry taste in his mouth
either she was one of the aesir or she
served them served them well a knife
in the heart was the only answer he had
for her and he meant to give her that
edged answer if he lived but she was
so very lovely   

  slowly the veil of darkness lifted he
saw a face he had seen before-the harsh
seamed features of the burly earthman
in the pit and beyond him the slim
martian girl all motionless standing
like statues beside him    beside him
for stuart was one of them now he was
in the pit with the other captives

  sensation came back slowly with it
came a tingling a warm vibration along
his spine    about his throat    inside
his brain he could not move but at the
corner of his range of vision flamed a
crimsonness-the cloak he still wore it

  he wondered if the other captives could
see him if their minds were as active as
his in their congealed bodies or whether
the chill of deathlike silence held their
brains along with their frozen limbs
what hath me

  a slow volcanic fury began to glow
within him kari-traitor and murderess
was she aesir was she earth-born
and that black-cloaked cowled creature
  which was not real another projector
of the aesir as the giants had been 

  you were sent by the protectors

  memory of karis phrase came back to
stuart now and with it as though he
had somehow unbarred a locked gate
opened it a mere crack came a-a whisper-
ing

  not audible faint faraway like the
shadow of a wind rustling ghosts of autumn
leaves the murmur rose and fell    call-
ing him

  the scarlet cloak moved    writhed   
flowed more closely about him fainter
grew the voices

  stuart strained after them his soul
sprang up     reaching toward those
friendly utterly inhuman whispers that
came from nowhere

  a dull lethargy numbed him the cloak
drew tighter   

  he ignored it deep in the citadel of his
mind he made himself receptive all his
being focused on that-that strange call-
ing from beyond

  and suddenly there were words   

 derek stuart can you hear us
answer

  his stiff lips could not speak but his
thoughts formed an answer and rising
and falling as though the frequency of that
incredible telepathy pulsed and changed
continually the message came-

  we have lost you have lost too
stuart but we will stay with you-we
must stay now-and perhaps your death
will be easier because of that   

  who are you  he thought oddly
awed by the personality he sensed behind
that voice that was really two voices

  there is little time the-sound-
faded into a thin whisper then grew
stronger the cloak makes it hard for us
to communicate with you and now we
can give you none of our power at all it
is a monstrous thing-a blasphemy such as
only the aesir would create half-alive-
it makes an artificial synapse between the
individual and outside mental contacts we
cannot help you-

  who are you

  we are the protectors listen now



stuart for soon you must walk the long
orbit with the others we removed some
of your memories so the aesir could not
read your mind and have time to prepare
themselves-we hoped we might destroy
them this time but-we have failed again
now-we give you your memories back
like a slowly rising tide stuarts past
began to return he did not question how
this was done he was too busy lifting the
veil that had darkened his mind since-
since that night at the singing star in
new boston a few drinks with the tired-
eyed man and then darkness-

  but the curtain was lifting now he
remembered   

he remembered a tiny underground
room with armed men-not many
of them-staring at him a voice that
said you must either join us or die we
dare run no risks for hundreds of years
a tiny band of us has survived only be-
cause the aesir did not know we existed
rebels he had asked

  sworn to destroy the aesir the man
told him and an answering glow burned
briefly in the eyes of the others

  stuart laughed

  you have courage the man said
youll need it i know why you laugh
but we dont fight alone have you
ever heard of the protectors

  never

  few have they arent human any
more than the aesir are but they are not
evil theyre humanitys champions they
have sworn to destroy the aesir as we
have-and so we serve them

  who are they then what are they
no man knows the other said quietly
who-and where-they are is a secret
they keep to themselves but we hear
their messages and once in a lifetime
not oftener they tell us where we may
find some man they have winnowed the
planets to discover in our lifetime
stuart you are the man

  he gaped at them why i-

  to be a weapon for the protectors-a
champion for mankind the protectors
are so far beyond humanity they cannot
fight our battles in their own forms they
need a-a vessel into which they can pour
their power or-call it a sword to wield
against the aesir they have searched
	planet

the worlds over for a long while now and
you- the man hesitated looking nar-
rowly at stuart you are the only vessel
they found you have a great destiny
derek stuart

  he had scowled at them all right
suppose i have what do they offer
the man shook his head death-if
youre lucky no man before you has
ever won a battle for the protectors you
know that-the aesir still rule every
chance is against you in a thousand years
no man has won the gamble but this is
greater than you or us derek stuart do
you think you have any choice

  stuart stared the other man in the eyes
theres no chance

  the leader smiled all mankinds indomi-
table hope was in the smile

  would the protectors have spent all
their efforts and ours to find you if there
were no hope they have mighty and
terrible powers with the right man for
their vessel they could be stronger than
the aesir no man could stand alone
against the aesir the protectors could
not stand alone but together-sword and
hand and brain welded into one-yes
stuart theres a chance

  then why have the others failed
no one has yet been quite strong
enough only once in forty years-fifty-
is a man born who might with luck have
the courage and the strength look at us
here-do you think we would not offer
ourselves gladly instead the protectors
guided us to you if you are willing to
let them establish contact with your mind
enter it possess it-theres a chance the
aesir can be destroyed theres a chance
that mans slavery may be ended his
voice shook with that mighty hope

  stuart glanced around at the ardent
fanatical faces and something in him took
a slow fire from the fire in theirs a deep
and vital purpose as old as humanity-
how many times before in earths history
had men of earth gathered in hidden rooms
and sworn vows against tyranny and op-
pression how many times before had
earthmen dedicated themselves and their
sons sons if need be to the old old dream
that though men may die mankind must
in the end be free

  here in this crowded room the torch of
freedom still burned despite the hell of

stories

slavery under which the worlds toiled now
  he hesitated

  it wont be easy stuart the man
warned a sword-blade must be ham-
mered on the anvil heated in flame before
its tempered the protectors will test
you-so that your mind may be toughened
to resist the attacks of the aesir later
you will suffer   

  he had suffered those agonizing night-
mare dreams in the forest the phantoms
that had tortured him-other trials he did
not want to remember but there had been
no flaw in the blade in the end-the pro-
tectors had been satisfied and had entered
his mind-maintaining the contact that
still held though thinly now

  and the voices he heard still whispering
within him were the voices of his men-
tors   

  we took your memories from you so
that the aesir could not read too much in
your mind and be forewarned now that
does not matter and you will be stronger
with your memory restored but when
you let the girl clasp the cloak about you-
that was failure

  if i could move stuart thought if
i could rip it off-

  it is part of you we do not know
how it can be removed and while you
wear it we cannot give you our power
stuart said bitterly if youd given
me that power in the first place-

we did how do you think you
vv survived the first testing by the
aesir and it is dangerous we must
gauge it carefully so that we do not trans-
mit too much of our mental energy to you
you are merely human-if we let you
draw on a tenth of our power that would
burn you out like a melting wire under a
strong current

  so-what now

  we have lost again you have lost
and we are sorry all we can do is give
you an easy death we possess you now
mentally if we should withdraw from
your brain you would die instantly we
will do that whenever you ask for the
aesir will kill you anyhow now and not
pleasantly

  im not committing suicide as long
as i live i can still fight

  we also this has happened before
what hath me	

we have chosen and possessed other cham-
pions and they have failed we withdrew
from their minds before the aesir   
killed  so that we could survive to try
again to wage another battle some
day we will win some day we shall de-
stroy the aesir but we dare not cling to
our broken swords lest we too be
broken

  so when the going gets tough you step
out

  stuart sensed pity in the strange twin
voice we must we fight for the race
of man and the greatest gift we can give
you now is quick death

  i dont want it stuart thought furi-
ously im going to keep on fighting
maybe thats why youve always failed
before-you were too ready to give up
so ill die if you step out of my mind
well-its a lousy bargain

  there was no anger only a stronger
overtone of pity in the still voice

  what is it you want stuart
nothing from you just let me go
on living ill do my own fighting therell
be time enough to take a powder when the
axe falls im asking you simply this-
keep me alive until ive had another crack
at the aesir

  a pause it is dangerous dangerous
for us but-

  well

  we will take the risk but understand-
we must leave you if the peril grows too
great and will-inevitably

  thanks stuart said and meant it
one thing what about kari who is
she

  a hundred years ago she was human
then she was brought here and the aesir
possessed her-as we possess you she
has grown less human in that time as the
ilien grows stronger within her she has
only faint memories of her former life now
and they will vanish soon contact with
the aesir is like an infection-she will grow
more and more like them perhaps even-
tually become one of them

  stuart grimaced if the aesir should
withdraw from her-

 she would die yes her own life-
force has been sapped too far you and
she are kept alive only as long as the bond
of possession holds

-planet stories-spring

  nice stuart thought if the aesir were
destroyed kari would die with him and
if he faced doom he too would die as the
protectors withdrew to avoid sharing his
fate

  hell-what did he care whether kari
lived or died it was only the glamor of
half-alienage that had drawn him to the
girl a dagger in her throat-

  besides he was certainly facing doom
now

  all i can do- he said-and stopped
abruptly he was speaking aloud pa-
tiently the twin voice in his brain waited
for him to continue

  slowly he flexed his arms he tilted
back his head staring up at the rim of the
pit fifty feet above him he could see the
titan pillars rising toward the roof of
that mighty tower incredibly far above
but there was no sign of life

  i can move he said i-

  struck by a new thought he gripped the
folds of the cloak it was nauseously warm
and vibrant it seemed to move under his
hands he jerked at it and felt a twinge
of agonizing pain along his spine and
about his throat while a white-hot lance
stabbed into his skull

  if i could get rid of this-you could
help me

  we could give you our power to use
against the aesir but we do not know
how to remove the cloak

  i dont either stuart growled and
paused as a movement caught his eye the
muscular earthman near him was stirring

  he turned slowly beyond him the
martian girl swayed her feathery-crested
head and lifted supple slender arms and
the others-all about stuart they were
wakening to motion

  but no life showed in their dull eyes
no understanding only a blind empty
withdrawal

  they turned trooped toward the wall
of the pit    toward an arched opening
that was gaping suddenly

  the long orbit said the voice in
stuarts mind

  whats that

  death as the aesir feed they feed
on the life-force of living organisms

  is that the only way out

  the only way open to you yes
	planet stories

stuart went slowly after the others
they had crossed the threshold now
and were pacing along a tunnel lit with cold
blue brilliance that curved very gradually
toward the left behind him a panel
closed

  the cloak swayed like a great blood-
stain behind him moving in a motion not
entirely caused by stuarts movements he
tried again to unfasten it but the clasp at
his throat only drew tighter and the
tingling sensation increased along his spine

  an artificial synapse    blocking his
nerve-ends so that he could not draw upon
the protectors power   

  at his left was an alcove in the tunnel
wall it was filled with coagulated light
   bright with glaring flames    flame-hot
within that white curtain stirred swift
movement like the leaping of fires above
the recess a symbol was embossed in the
stone the sign of mercury

  mercury said the voice in stuarts
mind the servant of the sun the
swift messenger mercury that drinks
the suns fires and blazes like a star in the
skys abyss first in the long orbit-
mercury

  the crowd of prisoners dull-eyed
swayed to and fro a ripple of excitement
rustling through them abruptly the mar-
tian girl darted forward-

  was engulfed in the milky flames

stood there while curdled opalescence
veiled her on her face sheer horror as-
the aesir feed the voice wispered
they drink the cup of her life  to its
last dregs

  the captives were moving again silently
stuart followed them along the tunnel
now another recess showed in the wall

   blue    blue this time as hazy seas of
enchantment    misted with fog with
slow shifting movement within it   

  the sign of venus said the voice
the clouded world planet of life and
womb of creation ruler of mists and
seas-venus	x

  the earthman wasf drawn into the al-
cove stood there while azure seas washed
higher and higher about him through
that glassy veil his face glared stiff with
alien fear   

  the sacrifices went on

  there was no alcove no symbol for
earth the aesir had forgotten the world

that had been their place of birth

  mars red star of madness ruler of
mans passion lord of the bloody seas
where scarlet sands run through times
hourglass-mars third in the long or-
bit

  the crimson glow of a dusty ruby   
the face of a venusian strained twisted in
agony    the hunger of the aesir   

  the little worlds the great belt
that girdles the inner system the broken
planet-

  tiny goblin lights dancing and flicker-
ing blue and sapphire and dull orange
wine-red and dawn-yellow-

  the hunger of the aesir

  jupiter titan collossus of the
spaceroads jupiter whose mighty hands
seize the ships of man and drag them to
his boiling heart the great one-fifth
in the long orbit

  the hunger of the aesir

  rnged saturn light-crowned guar-
dian of the outer skies saturn-

  uranus    neptune   

   pluto

  the hunger of the aesir   

  beyond pluto dark worlds stuart had
not known until finally he was alone
the last of his companions had been drawn
into one of the vampire alcoves of the long
orbit

  he went on

  there was another recess in the wall
at his left it was filled with night jet
blackness cold and horrible brimmed it

  something like an invisible current
dragged him forward though he fought
with all his strength to resist instinc-
tively he sent out a desperate call to the
protectors

  we cannot aid you we must leave
you    you will die instantly

  wait dont-dont give up yet give
me your power-

  we cannot while you wear the cloak
the edge of blackness touched stuart
with a frigid impact he felt something
avid with horrible hunger strain forward
from of the alcove reaching for him the
cloak billowed out-

  sweat stood out on stuarts face for
suddenly he had seen the way it might
mean death it would certainly mean fright-
ful agony-but he could go down fighting
if the cloak could not be removed in any
what hath me	

other way-perhaps it could be ripped off

  he gripped the half-living fabric at its
bottom brought his arm behind him-and
tore the horror from him

stark abysmal nerve-shock poured
like a current of fire up his spine and
into his brain it was like tearing off his
own skin sick blind gasping dry-throated
sobs stuart stumbled away from the black
alcove tearing at the cloak it tried to
cling to him-

  he ripped it away-hurled it from him
and as it fell-it screamed

  but he was free

  for an instant sheer weakness over-
whelmed him then into him poured a
racing jubilant torrent of strength of
mighty intoxicating power that seemed to
heal his wounds and revivify him in-
stantly

  into him surged the power of the pro-
tectors 

  from the alcove a finger of darkness
tendrilled out he was borne away from
it    along the passage dimly through
drifting mists he sensed that he was mov-
ing up a ramp    through a wall that
seemed to grow intangible as he approached
it   up and up   

  he was in the hall of the aesir

  above him the cyclopean pillers tow-
ered dwarfing the thrones set between
them before him hung the shifting wall
of light

  he was carried toward it-through it

  he stood on a black dais facing him
was the cloaked cowled figure he had last
seen with kari

  and beside the aesir stood kari

  the creature lifted its arm  a red
flame spouted toward stuart sudden
mocking laughter spilled from his lips he
no longer fought alone the tremendous
power of the protectors blazed within him
power and energy and force that could
smash suns

  in midair the fiery lance failed and died
the aesir drew back a step drawing its
cloak about it as if in surprise and kari
-kari shrank back too and something
strangely like hope flashed for a moment
across her dazzling her more than mortal
loveliness hope  but she was of the
aesir now and if they failed she died
then why-

  the aesirs cloak flickered and a second
gush of fiery light fountained toward
stuart

  up surged the tide of power in him
again blind and dazed with his own
tremendous energy stuart felt a curve like
a dim shield flung up to meet that lance
the aesirs fire struck-and flashed into
blazing fragments on the protectors
shield each droplet sang intolerable music
as it faded and winked out and be-
hind the aesir more dazzling than any
immortal fire had been stuart saw karis
sudden shining smile   

  she would die if the aesir failed she
must know she would die but the bril-
liance of her smile struck him as the
aesirs spear of fire could never strike
he knew then he understood   

  the aesirs cloak whirled like a storm-
cloud in dark deep billows the aesir
itself grew taller for a moment as if it
drew itself up to a godlike height and
then it did for derek stuart what no
aesir had ever done for a mortal man
before no aesir had ever needed to it
cast off the hampering cloak and stood
stripped for battle with this primitive man-
ling whose forebears immemorially long ago
had been the aesirs forebears there was
in that stripping something almost of kin-
ship-an acknowledgment that here at last
in the hall of the aesir stood an equal
sprung of equal stock   

  naked in its terrible power the aesir
stood up to face the man

  not human not ever human except in
the mysterious basics which these people
of a thousand millenniums in the future
had chosen to retain the flesh they had
cast off and the flesh the aesir stood up
in to face his forebear was pure blazing
blinding energy twice as tall as a man
it stood shining with supernal brilliance
terrible and magnificent

  the great hall rang soundlessly with the
power of the protectors

  and then from above a streak of light
came flashing and another and another
and were engulfed in the one aesir who
stood shining before its adversary growing
ever brighter and more terrible the rest
of the aesir coming to the aid of their
fellow forming a single entity to crush
the champion of mankind

  stuart braced himself for the incredible
	- planet

torrent of energy that would come blasting
through him from the protectors and
in a split second-it came

  mind and body reeled beneath the im-
pact of that power as force flared through
him and struck out at the tower of light-
ning which was the aesir but the force
which was trying his human body to its
utmost was not force enough to touch that
blinding column energy lashed out from
it struck him a reeling blow- stuart
dropped to his knees the hall swimming in
fire around him

  but what he saw was not the terrible
blazing image of his adversary but karis
face beyond his falling meant her life
-but when she saw him go down the
brilliance dimmed upon her features the
hope he had seen there went out like a
candle-flame and she was once more only
a vessel of human flesh which the aesir
had possessed and degraded

  in his despair and his dizziness he
cried soundlessly help me protectors
give me your power

  the still double-voice said you could
not hold it you would be burned out
utterly

  ill hold it long enough he promised
desperately one second of power-only
that enough to smash the aesir then
death-but not till then 

  there was one instant when time
stopped that cataclysmic horror that had
risen a thousand years ago and raged
through the worlds like a holocaust stood
blazing before stuarts eyes it stooped
toward him poising for the hammer blow
that would smash him to nothing-

then a power like the drive of
galaxies through space thundered into
stuarts mind

  he had not expected this nothing
in human experience could have taught
him to expect it for the protectors
were not human no more human than the
aesir themselves land the unleashed
energy that roared soundlessly through
stuart rocked his very soul on its founda-
tions he could not stir he could not
think he could only stay upon his knees
facing the aesir-thing as galactic power
thundered through him and wielded him
like a sword against mans enemies

  higher and higher rose the crashing

stories

tides of contest the citadel shook pon-
derously upon the rocks of the god-made
little world perhaps that world itself
staggered in space as the titans battled
together  its rocking surface

  faster spun the core of radiant light
which was the aesir faster raced the
tides of power through stuarts blasted
body seeming to rip his very flesh apart
and blaze in his brain like hammers of
cosmic fire

  terribly terribly he yearned for sur-
cease for the end of this unthinkable de-
struction that was tearing his brain and
body apart and he knew he could end
it in a moment if he chose to let go   

  grimly he clung to the power that was
destroying him second by second count-
ing each moment an eternity he clung
to consciousness the crashing lances of
the protectors drove on upon the armor
of the aesir and the cyclopean pillars
of the great hall reeled upon their founda-
tions and the very air blazed into liquid
fire around him

  he never knew what final blow of cos-
mic violence ended that battle but sud-
denly without warning the vast column
of the aesir pulsed with violent brilliance
and the whole hall rang with a cry too
shrill and terrible for ears or the very
mind to hear except as a thrilling of
despair

  the tower rocked all the bright tapes-
tries billowed and flowed against the walls
and the radiant thing that was the aesir-

  went out like a blown flame stuart
saw it darken in the quickness of a heart-
beat from blinding brightness to an angry
sullen scarlet and then to the color of
embers and then to darkness

  there was nothing there at all

  and stuarts brain dimmed with it
one last glimpse he had of the shining
smile on karis face triumph and delight
in the instant before the cloudiness of
oblivion blotted her features out

  he was not dead somewhere far away
his body lay prone upon the cold pave-
ment of the aesirs hall a hall terribly
empty now of life but stuart himself
hung in empty space somewhere between
life and death

  the thought of the protectors touched
him gently almost caressingly

  you are a mighty man derek stuart
what hath me	

your name shall not be forgotten while
mankind lives

  with infinite effort he roused his mind
  kari- he said

  there was silence for a moment - a
warm silence but the voices speaking as
one said gently have you forgotten
when the aesir died kari died too and
you derek stuart-you can never go back
to your body now you remember that
sudden rebellion shook stuarts bodi-
less brain get out of my mind he
raged at the double voice what do
you know about human beings  ive won
for mankind-but what did i win for my-
self  nothing-nothing and kari-
get out of my mind and let me die what
do you know about love

  amazingly laughter pulsed softly
love said the double voice love
you have not guessed who we are
stuarts bewildered mind framed only a
voiceless question

  we know humanity the twin voices
said we were human once a thousand
years ago very human derek stuart
and we remembered love

he half guessed the answer you are-
there was a man and a woman once
the voices told him gently mankind still
remembers their legend-john starr and
lorna who defied the aesir

  john starr and lorna

  we fought the aesir in the days when
we and they were human we worked
with them on the entropy device that made
them what they are now-and made us-
ourselves when we saw what they
planned with their power we fought   
but they were five and strong because
they were ruthless we had to flee

  the voices that spoke as one voice were
distant remembering

  they grew in power on their asgard
world changing as the millenniums swept
over them as entropy accelerated for them
and we changed too in our own place in
our different way we are not human
now but we are not monsters as the
aesir were we have known failure and
bitterness and defeat many times derek
stuart but we remember humanity and
as for love-

  stuart said bitterly

  you know your love you have it for-

ever but kari   kari is dead

  the voices were very gentle you-
have sacrificed more than we you gave
up your love and your bodies we-

silence again then the woman
serene and gentle-voiced there is a
way john but not an easy one-for us
stuart thought but kari is dead

  the woman said her body is empty of
the aesir life-force and yours is burned
out by the power we poured through it so
that no human could live in it again un-
less-unless one more than human upheld
you

 lorna-

  we must part for awhile john we
have been one for a long while now we
must be two again for the sake of these
two until the change   

  what change asked stuart eagerly
as we changed so would you if our
lives upheld yours entropy would move
for you as it moved for the aesir and
for us and that too i think is good
mankind will need a leader and we can
help-john and i-more surely if we taste
again of humanity after awhile-after
millenniums-the circle will close and
john and i will be free to merge again
and you and kari too

  stuart thought but kari-will it be
kari

  it will be the gentle voice said
cleansed of the evil of the aesir sup-
ported by my own strength as you by
johns you will be yourselves again with
the worlds before you and afterward-a
dwelling among the stars with us   
the mans voice said lorna lorna-
you know we must beloved the softer
voice said we have asked too much of
them to offer nothing in repayment and
it will not be goodbye

  there was darkness and silence

  stuart was dimly aware of cyclopean
heights rising above him painfully he
stirred he was clothed in his own body
again and the battle-blasted hall of the
dead aesir towered high into the dimness
above him

  he turned his head

  beside him on the dais a girl lying
crumpled in the shower of her hair stirred
and sighed

 editors note when we had read through this in-a-class-by-itself story we
 exclaimed heres planets scoop on the world what do you think
 does mr loomis answer the questions how will future wars be fought

  will civilization be destroyed

supreme general hos-
hawk chief of staff watched with
piercing gray eyes while the presi-
dent of the united states of the western
hemisphere jeffrey wadsworth lay re-
laxed under a cosmic-ray lamp with no
covering but a towel over his loins

    the surgeon-general of the hemispheric
 armies raised his hand and the lamp
 receded

   is that enough hoshawk asked
 dryly

   its the maximum even for him said
the surgeon-general his reflexes will
- be faster than light itself

   hoshawk grunted his eyes narrow as
 far as he could see the speed of a mans
 reflexes even of a man who was about to
 champion seven hundred million persons
 wasnt as important as the mans loyalty or
 his sense of personal responsibility and
 hoshawk did not have much use for
 w adsworth

    augusto iraola of brazil deputy presi-
  dent for south america stepped forward
  from the group of forty men he asked
  the president anxiously how do you
  feel  iraola was old and bearded

    not bad said the president and his
 voice squeaked a little as it changed pitch

    the minister of state with a big port-
  folio under his arm said shouldnt we
  prepare the vice president

   morrison vice president for canada
 spoke pedantically it would be a tragedy
 to lose president wadsworth last month
 his iq was  nearly twenty points
 above any other member of the mutant
 college

    hoshawk barely caught himself in time
 to repress a snort a boy of sixteen no

 

matter what his iq was just a kid you
couldnt expect him to exhibit initiative
or even to take things seriously that
was why hoshawk had almost broken with
the hemispheric congress thirty years be-
fore-almost two of president jeffreys
lifetimes hoshawk reflected wryly

  the voice of the president slightly
amused came to them im all right
now he said i think i ate too much
ice cream last night nine dishes

  there were gasps hoshawk held back
his sarcasm but he could not refrain from
a triumphant glance at the ancient minis-
ter of state who avoided his eyes

  iraola was volatile sabotage he
said

  president wadsworth licked his lips with
the tip of his tongue no the new pine-
apple-avocado very good gentlemen i
recommend it

  the neuro-analyst whipped a graph from
his machine hoshawk barely looked at
the graph speed of reaction down to
zero point nine zeros three four-three
times normal speed lets get on with
the war

the presidents eyes had been fixed
hopefully on hoshawks grizzled face
and at hoshawks words he relaxed his
muscles rippled an instant and then he
was standing

  it was always a little shock to hoshawk
to see him move it wasnt right that any
man even a superior mutant should be
able to move faster than light-speed you
didnt dare to trust a man like that

  forty august heads-all but hoshawks
-inclined as the president stood there
but the president just smiled at them and

	planet

yawned and stretched luxuriously

  hoshawk was annoyed but there was
nothing he could do about it the hemi-
spheric congress had set up the mutant
college two hundred years ago and every
child with iq above  and physique
to match became a member for the sole
purpose of selecting a president whose
primary duty would be to fight a war if
it should come in his term on one of
the giant keyboards this had been a
concession to left-wing agitation that if
there was to be another war it should
be fought by the leaders and not by the
ranks

  the mutant college had been established
when the hunyas had overrun europe
and asia and now for two centuries there
had been no war but only preparation for
war east against west through systems
of selection and training closely parallel
but with a difference that was forever in
hoshawks mind-if he was a capable
man the hunyas kept him for twenty-
one ears and obviously you could de-
pend a lot more on a man of thirty-five
than you could on a boy sixteen

  forgacs president of the hunyas was
thirty-three-an old man for a mutant and
smart and clever as only a mutant could
be at that age

  yesterday the hunyas had challenged

  it was sudden but not unexpected
there was no reason for delay at six
oclock tonight the two hemispheres would
match force and by eight oclock it would
be over

jeffrey wadsworth moved one
instant he was before them with a towel
around the middle of his bronze body the
next instant he was standing there dressed
in light plastic slippers red trunks and a
sleeveless blue shirt if hoshawk hadnt
been so old he would have been envious
of the presidents physique

  gentlemen jeffrey said i am ready
to go to the chamber he rubbed his
bare midriff in the region of his stomach

  are you ill hoshawk asked quickly

  no jeffrey watched the forty states-
men file out

  sire said hoshawk and his manner
was respectful for this boy of sixteen was
his commander-in-chief i still wish we
had trained a few thousand men in the

stories

use of weapons i dont see how we can
fight a war with electronic tubes

  jeffrey looked at him gravely war
with men is primitive lives cant be re-
placed

  hoshawk sputtered theres never
been any civilized war

  this time there will be jeffrey said
confidently

 but-

  well win jeffrey repeated we
must win and hoshawk caught a flash
of something deep in his eyes hoshawk
could not quite identify it and yet he
knew it spoke of the inner wisdom and
conviction of the young and in that
direction hoshawk reasoned lay their
weakness

  therell be trickery from forgacs
hoshawk predicted

  quite possible said wadsworth i
dont trust him myself he challenged
on a technicality

  hoshawk was gratified to hear a wor-
ried note in the presidents voice he
claimed we violated the agreement of
 he said probing by keeping sci-
entific discoveries to ourselves
wadsworth answered quietly then he
challenged because he himself had secrets
that he believed more potent

  nevertheless said hoshawk a few
hundred men trained in the use of tanks-
jeffrey shook his head and revert to
the primitive he pointed out if the
world is ever to get away from that kind
of war this is the time to prove it

  and if we lose we do so at the ex-
pense of a hemisphere

  thats true jeffrey said calmly but
if we should win by using men and destroy-
ing lives we would do so at the expense
of a civilization by the act of reverting
to the use of human fighters we would
convince the world that war could not be
fought electronically

  they reached the door of the chamber
the president shook hands with iraola
and with hoshawk

  wish me luck he said lightly

  they inclined their heads and when
they looked up the president was seated
on a beryllium stool that traveled a three-
quarter circle before the great bank of keys
like the keyboard of a giant organ he
pulled on a glass helmet and adjusted the
electron eat electron



sonic amplifiers to his mastoids he
flicked the oxygen valve open and shut
and then looked at it and listened intently

  hoshawk saw an instants doubt on the
presidents face hoshawk wondered if
the valve was leaking and frowned the
chamber had been tested exhaustively
but with hundrds of thousands of circuits
cut-backs by-passes and relays it was
possible the oxygen valve had been over-
looked

jeffrey trapped himself into the
chair the chronometer showed five
minutes before the hour the president
looked at the huge curved map of the
atlantic now aglow with light above the
big keyboard his eyes swept the thou-
sands of ivory keys and he rubbed his
hands together for a final limbering of his
fingers

  he spoke and his intent voice came to
them through the amplifier hhq

  north america is completely evacuated
sire to the polar ice-cap there is now
no human being on the continent the
hunyas refused our request to declare
new york an open city and it was evacu-
ated thirty minutes ago

  the president called for a chronometer
check the instrument in the chamber
had lost two hundredths of a second and
hoshawk could see that jeffrey was mak-
ing a mental note of that he was forced to
admit that the young mutant was thorough

  there were two minutes left jeffrey
sat straight before the great keyboard
poised an instant and then his incredibly
facile fingers played the keys flashing
from one bank to the next shooting the
chair to right and to left while he watched
the map above him and the great bank of
lights on each side then he leaned back
relaxed

  hoshawk was glad now they were play-
ing it safe jeffrey had insisted on the
midwest chamber in preference to the
pacific or atlantic station for this was
modern war there would be only one
person killed this was a war of elec-
tronics deadly and final but no one would
be actually killed but the losing president
that was decreed by the six-continent
council

  it was one minute before the hour the
president pressed a key

  the starter answered president
wadsworth are you ready

  ready said jeffrey in a high voice

  hoshawk heard the starters voice
president forgacs are you ready

  ja came the deep voice of the hunyac
president

  jeffrey flicked the oxygen valve for
a second snapped it off and hoshawk
saw him glance down at it then jeffrey
sat poised all the alertness of his in-
credible mind bearing intently on the
map before him

  a bell sounded the war was on

  jeffrey did not move he waited and
watched ten trillion electronic tubes
would flash their information on the map
he waited-one minute two mintes five
minutes the map was dark

  so forgacs wanted him to move first

  jeffrey flicked the oxygen and his chair
shot to the left his fingers blurred into
movement he shot back to the center of
the keyboard and focused his entire intellect
on the map

  a dozen tiny red lights rose off the
coast of newfoundland and raced east-
ward each light represented a thou-
sand rockets loaded with thirty tons of
dtn one of those rockets would wipe
berlin from the earth-if it struck

  but hoshawk knew the president did
not expect them to reach europe

  they did not near the coast of hol-
land they began to wink out one got
as far as cologne

  if the chamber had been above ground
instead of three hundred feet deep in solid
rock they would have felt the concussion
for dtns powerful waves traveled at the
speed of light

  still there was no answer

  jeffreys fingers played for an instant
on the keys red lights rose from lab-
rador from near boston from florida and
streaked east-not for berlin this time
but for marseilles

  jeffrey was testing forgacs explosive
screen it was wholly effective one after
the other the trains of red lights winked
out

  but now there was an answer from
the bay of biscay red lights with black
dots on them began to wink on as the
mammoth tabulating machine in the room
below recorded the information from thou-


planet

stories

sands of hidden electronic tubes totaled
it and presented it on the map

  the president hardly watched them
his screen with its principal power-plant
in philadelphia would stop the rockets up
to a total of some seventy-five octillion
macro-ergs

  on the off chance that forgacs would
forget to close his screen after his rockets
had passed it jeffrey fired a salvo from
the bahamas

  forgacs answered with three salvos from
brest and jeffrey gave him back ten from
long island then hoshawk frowned as
he saw the president rub his stomach
hoshawk had always opposed that abomi-
nable atavistic confection called ice cream

  it was a game of incredibly swift cal-
culation and rapier thrusts from strong
point to strong point in the effort to
break through the screen once the screen
should be broken anything might happen

jeffrey could see when his own
screen was up but their science had
devised no way to detect the enemys screen
except by firing into it jeffrey pressed a
pedal with his left foot and a thin golden
line flashed on in a flattened arc from
greenland down through the atlantic and
curved around the falkland islands

  jeffreys screen was up the biscay
salvos began to wink out against it jef-
freys hands began to flash red lights
winking up along the coast of europe and
from north africa showed that forgacs
was opening up

  jeffrey cut in the oxygen for a second
and flicked it off then his left foot slashed
at the pedal as he cut his screen to let his
own rockets through and then threw it on
again to stop the enemy

  forgacs was beginning a drive on phila-
delphia the site of the power plant jer-
frey was watching for an opening to mar-
seilles vulnerable for the same reason

  jeffrey kept firing rockets but his
mutant mind would be racing ahead cal-
culating with infinite precision the times of
discharge and times of arrival

  it was apparent by now that forgacs
most powerful defenses were centered
around marseilles because forgacs was
not using them this meant he was not
taking a chance on opening the marseilles
sector of the screen

  jeffrey calculated the probable inter-
change of batteries for some sixty moves
ahead hoshawk knew then he began to
fire the philadelphia batteries at intervals

  the firing rose in intensity and jeffreys
faster-than-light fingers played the great
keyboard like a master organ a bell
sounded and his right foot threw on the
western screen with its automatic cut-out

  and all the time jeffrey fired his big
philadelphia batteries at intervals with a
definite rhythm-five three and six sec-
onds

  he shot to the right and manipulated a
bank of keys and was back in the center
almost instantaneously

  pie did not pause in his rocket salvos
but in three minutes and eight seconds his
first salvo of one-ton atom bombs would
reach the marseilles screen if he had
calculated correctly the marseilles screen
would be open for an instant just as the
atom bombs reached it he didnt think
forgacs could resist the temptation to
blast philadelphia with his marseilles
batteries

  presently a thousand red lights winked
up from the screen at marseilles but for-
gacs overlooked the atom bombs they
were slower than the rockets and there
was no way to tell from the map which
was which

  jeffery shot a look at the chronometer
and hoshawk saw the atom bombs go
through a few seconds later the glow
in marseilles began to redden and
hoshawk exulted the atom bombs had
done their work the marseilles screen
was weakening

  jeffrey played the keys with fantastic
speed the war would soon be over
thousands of little red lights began streak-
ing toward marseilles at first they ex-
ploded in air as they hit the screen but as
the explosive force of the dtn began
to drain the screen those behind began
to pour through

  but there was a flash from philadelphia
and a shock went through hoshawk
something was wrong there jeffrey
hadnt intended that forgacs had used
atom bombs and had broken through when
the screen was down

  jeffreys fingers snatched at the oxygen
valve he tore it off and threw iton the
floor he still held one important ad van-
electron eat electron	

tage he was ahead of forgacs by forty
seconds

  philadelphia went out and the golden
defensive screen began to fade but jef-
frey tensely erect stayed on the attack
hundreds of green lights began to rise
around marseilles - great submarines
controlled by electronics and carrying tanks
and guns and explosives

  the green lights converged on mar-
seilles they got through the screen now
was the big gamble jeffrey guessed that
forgacs would operate from an under-
ground chamber near marseilles itself

  it wasnt a logical thing to do and so
forgacs would do it believing that jef-
frey would pass marseilles and go inland
to find the chamber

  jeffrey let him believe that he sent
eight thousand giant electron-controlled
bombers through the marseilles gap and
straight for berlin

  the green lights started winking on the
coast of france showing the submarines
were unloading amphibious tanks jef-
frey started them out across france at high
speed near paris they met heavy resis-
tance from forgacs tank-killers

  but now jeffrey had more trouble
forgacs had slipped a salvo of atom bombs
into the labrador power station and the
entire north quadrant of jeffreys screen
was down and just at that instant the
automatic breaker failed and a tube burned
out in the montevideo power station and
the southern half of south america was
exposed green lights began to wink up
at the open spaces

jeffrey was grim it was near the
end dog eat dog his flying fingers
chose to ignore forgacs attack beyond
firing millions of salvos of small rockets
which were little better than a delaying
action

  there were only two targets in this
war-the chambers

  jeffrey released his trump-thirty-five
hundred flying robot tanks

  they rocketed through the marseilles
screen and came on the city from the land
side firing eight-inch rockets and shooting
flames out half a mile ahead

  but this was a feint too from the sea
now rose a great armada of robot subma-
rine carriers that spewed out tanks that

were little more than armored tank-cars
filled with jellied xpr which exploded
always down toward the center of gravita-
tion they poured out the jelly on the
surface around marseilles for a distance
of twenty miles until according to jef-
freys figures the ground was covered a
foot thick the flame-throwers roared
into it and jeffrey stopped them there

  then he fired his last salvo of atom-
bombs from the bahamas

  in the meantime forgacs tanks had
overrun boston searching for the ameri-
can chamber

  the lights began to wink out and
hoshawk knew that boston was being
destroyed

  orange lights indicating bombers were
heading for chicago and hoshawk
knew that if jeffreys guess on mar-
seilles was bad he had not much longer
to live

  he looked at the map the atom-
bombs were at marseilles a glow showed
around the twenty-mile circle that he had
covered with jelly and hoshawk knew
the atom-bombs had landed

  he knew that on the other continent
the most tremendous explosion in mans
history was taking place and when it was
over there would be a mile-deep crater
where marseilles had been and anything
no matter how deep it was buried would
be destroyed by concussion

   jeffrey still played the keys but his eyes
were on the orange lights approaching
chicago

  they reached chicago perhaps directly
over their heads but hoshawk felt no
bombs a moment later the planes were
still going westward

  jeffrey called the starter does for-
gacs concede he askec

  there was a moments delay then
forgacs does not answer

  the president let out an undignified
whoop he tore off the straps that held
him in the chair threw his helmet across
the chamber we won

  the hemispheric diplomats were gath-
ering excitedly in the corridor jeffrey
unsealed the chamber

  hoshawk shook hands with him you
did it he said gruffly i apologize for
ever thinking-

  the chamber shuddered and hoshawk
	planet

paled but jeffrey held up his hand he
glanced at the chronometer that was
marseilles blowing up he said

  his feet moved and he was gone in
a moment he was back excuse me
gentlemen he begged ive got to see
the squad just figured out a way to beat
the blues if you-

  he stopped frowned 

  he had felt it before they did-a dis-
tant blast then they heard it-a dull
explosion through three hundred feet of
solid rock above them the floor shud-
dered under their feet

  it came again and again farther away
a pattern then off somewhere else came
another string of explosions

  the forty august heads stared at the
ceiling mouths were open but the presi-
dents mutant brain in seconds analyzed
the possibilities and came up with the
answer

  atom-bombs

  imposible growled hoshawk for-
gacs chamber was destroyed

  the president was already back in the
chamber he pressed a key

  starter came the answer forgacs
chamber is destroyed you have won
the war

  hoshawk was behind him but hes
still firing isnt he

  no the president was icily alert
he pointed to the big map there were
no red pin-points that would indicate
rockets or bombs coming from the euro-
pean continent the chamber is gone
undeniably gone

  a new pattern of bomb-bursts came
from above chicago must be destroyed
by now said the president harshly he
pointed to a blacked-out area on the ground-
glass screen above there are no detector
tubes left above us but look-orange
lights thousands of them coming from
the sea on the maryland coast and look
there to the right one-two-fifteen
thousand bombers coming

  hoshawk nodded as if he had known it
all the time sure he has men in those
planes live men who can observe and
act independently hes throwing hun-
dreds of thousands of planes and sub-
marine tractors and mobile bomb-throwers
at us-all operated by men and forgacs
himself is here leading them were

stories

whipped sire where is your civilization
now 

wadsworth was calm he was

taking it like a man anyway he
threw a lever and poised at the great key-
board then his mutant fingers began to
work in blurred movement

  hoshawk watched the screen above the
atlantic filled with long trains of red lights
that arose from their american bases and
streamed eastward

  hoshawk blinked youre firing every-
thing and youve locked the controls
wadsworth didnt look up in five
minutes he said there wont be an ounce
of explosive left in any emplacement in
america

  but thats- hoshawk started to say
foolish but he changed it that wont
help sire forgacs equipment is all over
here now

  but wadsworth leaned back their
golden explosive screen showed no longer
on the map already some of the em-
placements had ceased to spew out red
lights and the tail-ends of their trains were
disappearing to the east

  hoshawk shuddered as he saw that now
america was completely defenseless

but wadsworth spoke into his trans-
mitter radio give me special fre-
quency three-hundred-eighty-one thousand
six hundred kilocycles clear all air-lines
yes sire

  the president pressed the scrambler
button and then spoke the words came
out of the amplifier three tons of butter
unloaded a fast curve day before tomorrow
because the baby was yelling for its morn-
ing high-ball the soap-suds are thick
enough for whipping but who knows where
or when

  the president leaned back and smiled
thats an order to all sixteen thousand
mutants over the country to be on the alert
at their predetermined stations

  hoshawk frowned but everybodys
been evacuated

  not the mutants you see general
we ourselves havent trusted forgacs
hoshawks grim face lighted up do
you mean you have secretly made some
fighting equipment

  wadsworth shook his head nov we
could have theres a loophole in the
electron eat electron	

twenty-one eighteen agreement but we
have observed the spirit-ah

  up on the ground-glass screen purple
lights had been flashing on at intervals
over the united states until now there
were nineteen and wadsworth spoke
those represent transmitter stations
equally spaced over the country they
are all manned by mutants

  hoshawk actually snorted transmit-
ter stations you cant fight with words
and anyway there wont be any power
at all within a half hour

  they each have their own power-plant
the president said quietly

  hoshawk looked at the map again and
groaned the nation was almost covered
by a canopy of orange lights marked with
black crosses there must be at least
a million bombers over us theyll wipe
out the whole country within an hour
if theres anything you can do do it
the president was pale but he sat
quietly stalled hoshawk thought sar-
donically it took something besides smart-
ness to win a war it took character too

 wadsworth pointed to the american
shores long lines of green and white
and black and yellow dots coming from
the sea crawling in among the orange
lights that swarmed over america like a
gigantic swarm of hornets submarines
amphibian battleships flame-throwers
tanks he said

  hoshawk stood erect if it were not
against regulations sire i would be
tempted to blow my head off we shall
be destroyed as a people and as a con-
tinent

  the presidents hands were clenched
but he answered slowly as a continent
perhaps but the buildings can be built
again as a people-no i dont think so
as a civilization i hope we can be saved
hoshawks eyes narrowed how
he demanded

  those purple lights represent sonic
transmitters in other words generating
stations for sound frequencies above the
narrow band which can be heard by hu-
mans they were developed built and
financed by graduate mutants they broad-
cast on different frequencies that we have
determined most effective in upsetting the
equilibrium of unstable chemical com-
pounds

  do you mean asked hoshawk that
you are going to try to detonate the ex-
plosives carried by forgacs planes

  his planes and anything else that car-
ries them we have analyzed samples of
his explosives to determine the critical fre-
quency of each these nineteen stations
cover the country any known explosive
in the continental united states will be
detonated when these stations go into
operation

  what if forgacs has some unknown
explosive 

  wadsworth was solemn we take that
chance he said but the range of pos-
sible explosive combinations is well known
and something entirely different is un-
likely at any rate-

  theyre starting to drop bombs
hoshawk said

the president watched the red glow
around kansas city his face was
taut there will be many cities de-
stroyed he said but we must wait for
all of forgacs equipment to be within our
continental limits it must all be destroyed
at once

  but the bombers are in action said
hoshawk denver is getting it now
wadsworths eyes were on the coast-
lines it will be twenty minutes at least
before we can open the transmitters we
may lose most of our cities by that time
but there is nothing we can do

  the red- glows began to spread dallas
and fort worth new orleans atlanta
miami san diego and los angeles san
francisco portland and seattle the
bombers were systematically destroying
americas population centers and still
wadsworth waited he sat tense before
the map watching the endless stream of
lights come from the sea

  but they were beginning to end many 
were far inland attacking the smaller cities
cleaning up the big ones

  the bombers wont be destroyed said
hoshawk if theyve already dropped their
bombs

  i think they will for all practical pur-
poses said the president their am-
munition their signal flares-everything
explosive will be detonated

  how can you cover them all at once
  there are over nine hundred frequen-
	planet

cies-but we dont know that they will be
enough jeffrey pointed out gravely we
can only hope

  hoshawk couldnt stand still any
longer he paced the floor before the map
every city in america of more than a
hundred thousand is gone-obliterated
he said tonelessly cant we ever-
wait the president was alert the
last line of flame-throwers is coming on
land he pointed to the black dots
streaming up on the west coast he spoke
into the audio transmitter he didnt
bother with the scrambler now sonic
stations on emergency force sonic sta-
tions on emergency force situation
critical

  he pointed to the map and sat back
within a few seconds the purple lights be-
gan to flash intermittently

  theyre on said the president but
it will take a few minutes for them to reach
full intensity the sonic devices operate
at high speeds-some at two hundred thou-
sand rpm

  hoshawk watched almost without
breathing for the first time he was aware
that the forty statesmen of the western
hemisphere were watching through the
glass windows of the chamber

  at that instant purple glows began to
surround the green lights starting on the
east coast of florida and spreading up-
ward

  amphibian submarines whispered the
president their aerial torpedoes are
exploding

  and up around the great lakes said
hoshawk there its amphibian tanks

stories

  the president sat and watched the
glows spread they absorbed flame-throw-
ers tractors mine-heavers the map of
america was a clustered mass of lights
with the purple glow beginning to con-
sume everything in its reach

  the planes said jeffrey theyre
still untouched they anticipated some-
thing like this he barked into the micro-
phone all stations ascending frequency
he ordered and turned to hoshawk we
dont know how effective this will be it
isnt as powerful as the static ranges
but-

  it is theyve got the range cried
hoshawk

  jeffrey looked near albuquerque
new mexico a cluster of orange lights was
being consumed by the purple glow jef-
frey shot a glance at a dial all stations
all stations freqency seventy-two thou-
sand nine eighty emergency fre-
quency seventy-two thousand nine eighty

  and the purple glow rolled and spread
and consumed forgacs bombers by the
thousands

  at last wadsworth looked at the map
with nothing left but the dead embers of
a mighty army

  hoshawk shook hands with him and
then looked for a place to sit down for a
moment sire he said at last licking
his lips with the tip of his tongue if it
isnt presumptuous id stand the check
for a dish of that new ice cream

  jeffrey looked at him and smiled youd
better have one yourself

questionable reference to the sergeant

  the dust-caked ranks marched along
quietly carefully refraining from express-
ing their opinion of this disgusting detail
but hallihan knew what they were think-
ing and he could well understand their
displeasure these were hard-bitten two-
fisted hell for leather ip men and here
they were with shovels and picks slung
over their shoulders plodding out to scratch
in the dirt like common dime-a-dozen
ditch-diggers

  hallihan felt as strongly about it as
they but orders were orders and he prided
himself on his ability to carry out a com-
mand regardless of whether or not it
conformed with his personal sentiments
this job had to be done and the men all
knew it could not be entrusted to a mob
of imported flunkies the squeakers would
make short work of such a motley crew

  the sergeant emitted a soft sigh between
a snappy twuh and hree as his wandering
gaze came to rest on the slow-moving
grav-car in which rode the brusque cap-
tain staley the car skimmed along a foot
or so above the ground riding smoothly
on its gravity-repellent ray hallihan sud-
denly became acutely aware of his aching
feet would the captain never call a halt
hell they couldnt march straight through
to the mine without rest more than one
soldier was dragging his feet and the ser-
geant could hardly find the heart to snarl
out his customary get the lead out back
there soldier pep it up

  bringing up the rearguard of the orderly
lines was as strange a group of soldiers
as could be found on any moon of the
system these were the barbers de-
lights an odd life-form of titan that had
formed a sort of aloof friendship with the
patrol from the moment it landed the
men jokingly called them barbers delights
because of the thick shaggy coat of hair
that covered their log-like bodies the
bds either didnt understand or just
didnt care for they made no objection to
their nickname

  there were twenty of the creatures in
this group and more joined them along
the way they imitated the brisk step
of the soldiers with amazing exactness
though they possessed no semblance what-
soever of feet they moved on dense mats
of stubby resilient bristles that grew from

the flat bottoms of their column-bodies
sweeping forward like a horde of self-
propelling brooms not wishing to be
outdone by the visitors they had their own
sergeant who moved along importantly
at the side of his command glaring threat-
eningly from the corner of his single huge
eye as sergeant hallihan called out his
impeccable hut twuh hree foar
sergeant b d responded with ungh
ungh ungh ungh the only sound he
was capable of uttering hallihan scowled
over his shoulder and snorted disgruntledly
fervently wishing he could get his heckler
alone for a moment his hard cot would
have a new fur mattress that night

  hallihan estimated they were half-way
to the mine now that huge deposit of
chroidex salts was important to the system
without the precious mineral space-flight
would be impossible since there would
be nothing to protect travelers from deadly
solar rays the small amounts that had
been found on earth and the other major
planets would soon give out and titan
was the only other known source of
chroidex this deposit would last for
centuries and by the time it too wasex-
hausted perhaps engineers would have
figured a way around the difficulty

  captain staleys car came to a stop and
the tall man stepped out he stood a mo-
ment surveying the weary marchers with
sharp experienced eyes he knew just
how much he could get out of a man
knew when the limits of the human machine
had been reached

  you may rest your troops sergeant
hallihan he said shortly

hallihan sighed inwardly hoping
for at least a twenty-minute sur-
cease he went through the formality of
placing his men at ease then strode
anxiously to the captains side

  do you suppose there will be trouble
with the squeakers sir he asked appre-
hensively they dont take to us you
know they might ambush us at the mine

  the captain thought a moment then
his thin lips drew up in a smile

  i dont think they will their crude
weapons wouldnt stand a chance against
us in force personally i wish they would
attack then we could do away withthem
once and for all as it is we cant risk
crisis on titan



bringing laborers here to develop the mine
after the squeakers picked off a few of
them the miners would turn tail and run
for home so were temporarily stuck
with both jobs sergeant working the
mine and eliminating the squeakers well
catch the whole damn bunch of them in the
open some day when we do   

  the two men momentarily forgot their
conversation and turned to watch the antics
of the perplexed bds the shaggy crea-
tures were milling about uncertainly

  ungh ungh the log-shaped sergeant
barked out pointing a slim tentacle at the
reclining ip men ungh ungh

  but the bds were physically incapable
of duplicating the soldiers postures un-
derneath all that hair their bodies were
not much more than wooden posts stiff
erect and not given to bending at the
waist the bristling sergeant might as
well have saved his breath

  if only the squeakers were as friendly
as these fellows captain staley mur-
mured but sadly they dont have the
least thing in common their hate for us is
equaled if not exceeded by their fear of
the bds seems the bds have some
sort of racial disease that is fatal to the
squeakers if they come in contact with it
thats why youll never see any members
of these two races palling around together
too bad the bds arent intelligent enough
to cooperate with us with their aid we
could wipe out the squeakers in record
time

  a strange occurrence was taking place in
the ranks of the barbers delights the
exhausted sergeant had ceased his shout-
ing and the creatures stood about in stiff
poses of inactivity suddenly a cloud of
blue dust whooshed from the flat top of
a barrel-like bd and the thing disap-
peared in a flurry of fur and smoke

  noon sergeant hallihan said cryp-
tically

  others of the bds were going through
the same process it was as if the ground
had opened and swallowed them up halli-
hans heckler blew out a great cloud of
smoke and dwindled rapidly away to noth-
ing in one minute the unconcerned group
of half-animals was lessened by a third
the ip men sat with open mouths crain-
ing their necks over companions shoulders

-planet stories-spring

to better witness the event although
they had seen it many times in the past
weeks the weird exhibition never failed
to impress them

  those things never miss one soldier
said in awe come noon or midnight
and boom-away they go right on the
dot scrazy

  captain staley smiled at the man and
walked quickly to the spot where the bds
had disappeared sergeant hallihan fol-
lowing he bent to the ground and scooped
up a handful of elliptical waxy-surfaced
seeds

  reproduction man reproduction he
said their race just as any other would
come to a quick end if they didnt propa-
gate he pointed to five bds whose
fur was slowly turning yellow and falling
from their bodies in brittle patches in
exactly half an hour those creatures will
be dead and from these seeds will come
new bds to fill the gaps by actual
count we know there are approximately
five hundred of these beings on titan at
noon and midnight half of them repro-
duce and the half that has already repro-
duced dies thus there are at all times
exactly five hundred of the creatures no
more and no less the disease germs
that all of them carry though fatal to the
squeakers dont seem to have any ill effects
on them if they are injured their bodies
heal no matter how deep the wound so
a bd lives his full half-day titan-reckon-
ing regardles of accidents and diseases
i would like to remain here and watch
these seeds develop into full-grown bds
but we must be getting on to the mine
we shall remain there a week sergeant
returning to the garrison at the end of
that time for fresh supplies and equipment
four or five grav-trucks and cranes would
make the work much easier but all of
my requisitions to the government for these
have been rejected on the grounds the
squeakers might stage an uprising and
gain possession of valuable equipment as
i said well have to struggle along as best
we can until we can catch the squeakers
in a false move and blast them out of ex-
istence carry on sergeant

  hallihan snapped to attention as the
captain whirled on his heel and-returned
to his grav-car only fifteen minutes rest

  under the direction of hallihans acid
tongue the men heaved reluctantly to their
feet and fell into line whispering curses
as the sergeant roared out the hated
frard harch hut twuh hree foar

 ungh ungh ungh ungh ungh
ungh ungh- the bds quickly ap-
pointed a new sergeant and took up the
march with an eagerness that brought
grunts of disgust from the begrimed men

  hallihan glanced back over his shoulder
to fix an icy stare on this new nemesis
and his eyes widened with amazement as
he caught sight of a disheveled man stum-
bling along behind them his arms waving
frantically and his lips moving in a sound-
less yell the sergeant called a quick halt
and waited for the man to overtake them

  it was a soldier from the garrison
blood trickled from his lips and one arm
hung in a queer position at his side the
skin was hideously burnt and blackened
where a heat-ray had caught him full in
the face hallihan knew the man was
dying as he collapsed in his arms insanely
babbling managed to scape    got all
rest but managed to scape    must tell
you sergnt    must tell you  all rest
dead   

staleys car came to a jarring halt
beside them and the alarmed captain
jumped out his emotionless features soft-
ening with pity as he saw the mans con-
dition the soldier was talking again and
staley bent close to the mutilated mouth to
catch all of the feeble words

  all dead  all dead    squeakers
sprised us n took garrison    thousand
squeakers    thousand squeakers in
garrison  no chance  all dead  

  captain staley straightened and his eyes
were steely as he turned to hallihan he
waited while hallihan let the soldier gently
to the ground and assigned a man to watch
over him

  it was a gross mistake to leave such
a small complement of men at the garri-
son captain staley said bitterly i
seriously doubt that we can recapture it
if those creatures have enough intelligence
to load and fire the four atomic cannons
our sidearms will be of little use theyll
slaughter us to the last man but weve
got to try sergeant understand weve
got to try

  yes sir hallihan saluted and
turned grim-lipped to the waiting men
were returning to the garrison men
he said simply  bout face

  the bds scattered as the ip men
plowed through them but reformed be-
hind the swift-moving columns and scur-
ried anxiously after them another group
of the curious creatures joined their fel-
lows swelling the ranks to fifty they
made a strange sight as they hustled along
over the rocky ground the dire-eyed ser-
geant belching out his eternal ung ung
ungh ugh ungh ungh ungh-

  if only those crazy bucket-heads would
help us fight the squeakers hallihan
thought unhappily but they cant theyre
just dumb mimics they wouldnt know
one end of a heat-ray from the other
then he forgot about the bds and
started thinking about his shrieking feet

  they reached the garrison late in the
afternoon and hallihan began displacing
his men about the front of the structure
taking care they didnt expose themselves
to the squeakers fire in spite of their
caution five men were torn to shreds as
an atomic cannon let go catching them
in the open hallihan swore harshly and
ducked behind a huge boulder those
dirty sons meant business

  the bds followed suit gliding behind
upjuttings of rock and yelling one-syl-
lable curses at the embattled garrison they
watched the proceedings with casually-
interested eyes emitting sympathetic
unghs whenever a patrolman fell one
of the creatures got his top blown off when
he let it stick out too far from behind a
rock but he immediately grew a new one

  the ip men werent faring so well
most of the squeakers shots went wild
but the very intensity of their fire took its
toll of the outnumbered patrolmen halli-
han rushed about from rock to rock pat-
ting his soldiers on the back and shouting
words of encouragement in their ears
the bd sergeant hurried along behind
him whacking his tentacle across the furry
bodies of his compatriots and keeping up
a steady flow of loud well-pleased unghs

  captain staley was doing his sharfi of
the fighting he crouched behind a round
boulder snapping quick shots at the gar-
rison and drawing back before the squeak-
ers could locate him sergeant hallihan
crisis on titan	

flopped down beside him and lay staring
questioningly at his superior

  we cant win staley said matter-of-
factly the garrison was built to with-
stand just such a siege as this we have
to hit those loopholes in the wall dead-
center to bring down a squeaker we
couldnt have nailed more than half a dozen
or so half a dozen out of a thousand
attack from the rear is impossible be-
cause of the steep canyon walls protecting
the garrison on three sides if we could
rout them into the open we could blast
them down like cattle there would be
no escape except through our ranks and
our sharpshooters would take care of any
who broke through but thats just wishful
thinking sergeant the squeakers arent
stupid enough to try charging us theyll
stay holed up in the garrison picking us
off one by one theres no place to run to
all of our food and water is in the hands
of those devils so we have our choice of
fighting it out to the last man or retreat-
ing to the mine and wait for thirst and
starvation to end our worries what will
it be sergeant

  well fight sir hallihan said grimly
yclhoo pour it to em men  give em
a taste of ip hell

  above the noise of battle could be heard
the rat-like screeching of the squeakers
the bds answered with their version of
the bronx cheer and between them and
the ground-shaking c-r-rump-c-r-rump of
the atomic cannons the uproar was enough
to cause a nervous breakdown in the
staunchest habitue of times square

night fell across the scene and the
battle raged on the ip patrol-
men now had a slight advantage for the
large bulk of the garrison was easily dis-
cernible in the dim light and they had
the locations of the loopholes well-fixed in
their minds after each shot they shifted
positions crawling over the ground so the
squeakers could not observe their move-
ments more than one unlucky fellow was
found out though when a tall bd fol-
lowed him hurling challenges at the
squeakers in a loud attention-drawing
voice this hindrance was temporarily
done away with when midnight came and
fully half of the bds spouted blue smoke
from their shaggy tops and dwindled away

to silent waxy seeds more of them lost
their enthusiasm for the battle as their
brown fur slowly took on a yellowish hue
and they retired to various dark crannies
to sulk away their last few living moments

  i have an idea sir hallihan reported
excitedly to captain staley that
armored grav-car of yours could easily
gain the wall of the garrison without get-
ting knocked out of commission couldnt
it well heres the plan we use the
shovel handles to whip together a ladder
long enough to scale the wall then me
and a couple of the men speed through to
the garrison in the grav-car and prop the
ladder against the wall before the squeak-
ers can nail us maybe one or two of us
will live long enough to get over the wall
and open the gates then before the
squeakers catch wise the rest of you
charge through the gates and finish em
off what do you think sir

  i must commend you for your valor
sergeant staley said soberly but i
dont believe your plan would work even
assuming that one of you would get through
to the gates-and you must admit there
would be small chance of that-the squeak-
ers would still be in possession of the
cannons and our men would be easy tar-
gets at such close range we would only
bring about our own defeat that much
sooner however you have given me an

idea sergeant as you say the grav-car
could gain the garrison wall and a man
could stand outside with reasonable safety
if he was careful not to move in line with
a loophole what is the time sergeant

  why er five minutes past twelve sir
-titan-time 

  good staley said determinedly i
must put my plan into immediate opera-
tion in ten minutes sergeant my car
will move toward the garrison instruct
your men to direct a heavy fire at the
loopholes until i have reached the wall
the more confusion the better anything
that will draw the squeakers attention
away from me after that well- inform
your men of the plan sergeant

  hallihan gulped and saluted yes sir
that ill do sir cripes- had the old
man lost his marbles one man against
a thousand squeakers that was crazier
than hallihans own idea nevertheless
the sergeant raced away to lay down the
law to the sleepy-eyed soldiers

  ten minutes later captain staleys grav-
car leaped from behind a boulder and bore
down swiftly on the dark garrison in-
stantly the patrolmen began howling and
blasting at the garrison drawing a mur-
derous return fire from the mildly-sur-
prised squeakers the few bds who
were still capable of its added their voices
to the din and staleys car lurched to a
halt at the garrison wall completely un-
damaged the captain jumped out and
fumbled inside the car a moment

  what the hell was he doing hallihan
wondered he watched the dark form
move cautiously along the rampart and
stop at a point where a good-sized up-
heaval in the ground raised him to within
ten feet of the walls top the captain
went through some strange motions his
hand dug in his pocket and then his arms
snapped back like a baseball pitchers his
hand flicked forward and came down to dig
once more in his pocket again he went
through the movements of throwing some-
thing hallihan scratched his head puz-
zledly straining his eyes to see what staley
did next that was all staley returned
to his car and climbed inside but the
speedy little vehicle gave no indication of
withdrawing from its position against the
garrison wall

  things quieted down a bit then and
hallihan nearly went mad waiting for
something to happen now and then an
atomic cannon blasted out at the patrol-
men but the intensity of the squeakers
fire had diminished considerably from that
of earlier in the battle they had plenty of
time they would wait until morning
when the sun exposed the hiding places of
the ip men then it would be curtains
for these hated invaders from another
world hallihan wished he could sleep
but he knew if he did he might never
wake up again he waited   

  a minute later the sergeants hair al-
most stood on end as a prolonged hide-
ous screech of terror beat against his ears
growing swelling in intensity and owning
a note of stark unreasoning fear it came
from the garrison came from the throats
of a thousand panicked squeakers hal-
lihans jaw gaped ludicrously as the gates
burst open and hundreds of screaming
scrabbling sleek-boiled squeakers spilled
into the clearing fleeing from the garrison
as fast as their skinny legs could carry
them hallihan recovered quickly from
his surprise and drew a bead on the lead-
ing squeaker the creature crumpled un-
der the heat-beam shrieking in agony as
his fellows trampled over him making
pulp of his thrashing charred body

  give em hell boys hallihan shouted
exultantly pour it to the rats

  the ip patrolmen needed no coaxing
the terrified squeakers were already fall-
ing by the dozens under their withering
fire the rodent-like animals hesitated
not knowing where to turn some of them
ran to the canyon walls and tried to scrab-
ble up to safety but the sharp-eyed sol-
diers nailed them before they could go a
yard an atomic cannon started banging
away from the garrison and hallihan knew
captain staley had plunged his grav-car
through the open gates and taken over one
of the deadly guns after that it was
only a question of mopping up   m

when morning came the canyon
floor looked like an inverted grave-
yard blackened torn bodies all that
remained of the squeakers littered the
clearing weary patrolmen emerged from
behind the protecting boulders moving
warily lest some of the creatures were

mals were quite dead

  not more than a dozen got away
hallihan said satisfaction his voice
they were scared to come through our
lines with those bds hangin around
the ones that did get through will prob-
ably die of that strange disease the shag-
gies carry in their fur lets find out
about captain staley men

  staley was waiting for them when they
entered the garrison and so were fifty
barbers delights staley smiled when
he saw the question on hallihans beefy
face hallihan recovered enough to salute

  everything went well i trust ser-
geant staley asked

  yeah i mean yes sir we really
cleaned up on those devils we wont
have to worry about them any longer
they come out of here like bats outta hell
howd they come to blow their tops cap-
tain

  we have the bds to thank for that
staley said fondly patting one of the log-
bodied creatures on the back

  i dont see why sir hallihan said
skeptically we all know the things
aint got brains enough to fight any-
way how in all creation did they get in
here they- the sergeant stopped
abruptly he clapped a hand to his fore-
head in feigned exasperation and snorted
disgustedly cripes im stupid i mean

started goin through them crazy shenani-
gans in front of the wall i guess i ought
to apologize sir

  no need sergeant i suppose it did
seem as if i had gone mad but i knew
our only chance to beat the squeakers
was to get them into the open and the
only way to do that was to inspire great
fear in them the only thing the squeak-
ers feared was the barbers delights be-
cause of the fatal disease they bear in
their fur but obviously i couldnt in-
duce these dumb creatures to storm the
garrison and force the squeakers into the
open then i remembered the seeds the
bds seeds certainly couldnt object if
i carried them to the garrison wall and
tossed them inside that is exactly what
i did all there was to do then was wait
until the seeds blossomed into full-grown
bds and stampeded the squeakers right
into our hands the squeakers poor marks-
manship was no match for ours i be-
lieve our work is done here sergeant
experienced miners can take over the job
now

  yes sir hallihan grinned broadly
the men will be glad to hear that sir
but first weve got a bit of a mess to clean
up hold on to them shovels men you
aint through diggin yet lively now

  ungh ungh a new bd sergeant
took up the cry glaring balefully at his

 till blue venus

by emmett mcdowell

out of their mountain hideout came the terrified hand of the
renegade through the valleys of venus they swept seeking a
greed-maddened slaver who planned an experiment so cruel and
barbaric it would destroy the very foundation of mankind

the hooded figure of a man detached
itself from the shadows beside the
door paused listening nothing
stirred the huge sprawling plantation
house was silent and yet alive with the
feel of sleepers

  then from below stairs he heard a
door slam the tinkle of laughter as-
cended to his ears he crouched his
hand slipped inside his coat fondled the
slug gun nestling in its shoulder holster
the voices drifted out of hearing uneasy
silence settled back over the plantation
house

  the hooded man let his breath escape
between his teeth he slid back the door
passed inside like a shadow shut the door
behind him

  the room which hed entered was lit
by the intense green radiations from the
venusian vegetation the cold phos-
phorescent light streamed through the open
windows glinted from a glassite desk soft
flexoglas lounging chairs and sofa it
was the typical office from which the
plantation owners directed the affairs of
their feudal estates

  as silent as a night hawk the hooded
man drifted to the wall ran his finger-
tips over the wood paneling there was a
faint click the panel slid back revealing
a wall safe

  a needle ray of light streamed suddenly
from the hooded mans hand splashed off
a paper which hed drawn from his pocket
he checked the string of figures printed
there returned the paper to his pocket
he worked swiftly surely then with a
sigh of satisfaction he swung back the
heavy door

  there was a faint thump in the corridor



outside the office that broke the silence

  the hooded man snapped erect the com-
pressed air slug gun in his hand he
was sharply conscious of the hum of
venusian night life outside the windows
the room felt sticky close his hand was
damp with sweat about the pommel of
the slug gun

  he waited five minutes ten minutes with-
out moving but the noise was not re-
peated

  he drew a breath set to examining the
papers in the safe by the aid of the midget
flash most of them he put back carefully
just as theyd been but two packets he
stuffed into an inside coat pocket he
closed the door spun the dial he heard
a sharp click behind him leaped around

  at the same instant the room was
flooded with bright white light

  please dont said a girls voice

  the hooded man arrested his hand half-
way to his shoulder holster

  a startlingly beautiful girl he saw was
standing in the doorway to the corridor
covering him with a wicked dart gun
she was a tall girl with the yellowest hair
hed ever seen she wore a spun glass
negligee and her skin was blue it was
the pastel blue of a terran dawn flushed
with rose

  she came all the way inside slid shut
the door

  who are you what do you want

  why dont you turn in the alarm
said the hooded man dryly the poisoned
needle gun was sending goose flesh quiver-
ing up his spine a scratch would be fatal
his jaw tightened beneath the hood his
eyes were hard green discs the dangerous
eyes of a hunted man

  oh no the blue girls voice was low
i wouldnt do that id never be able
to get the safe open by myself

  what

  i want you to open the safe for me

the hooded man didnt reply for a
moment at length he asked what
then

  the girl giggled i take what i want
and you take what you want she explained
naively see and youll be blamed for
taking it all only youre going to be
disappointed

 disappointed how he took a
step toward her

  bemmelman never keeps his money on
the plantation its all at venusport
there arent fifty monad in the safe
maybe im not after money he took
a second step his green eyes opaque

  she looked at him intently made a thin
gasping noise youre the renegade
the dart gun trembled in her small blue
fist oh my god i didnt guess
youre the renegade

  without affirming or denying the state-
ment he asked what do you want from
the safe and took a third step

  dont come any closer im a very good
shot see

  the little gun went spat the hooded
man heard the dart whisper past his ear
thunk into the paneling behind him his
stomach felt suddenly hollow

  my dear girl he said dryly if you
do that again i wont be able to open a
book let alone that safe im a mass of
jelly now

  then you will open it for me
  what is it you want

  evidence impulsively she took a
step toward him allowed the dart gun to
waver out of line evidence to send
bemmelman to the disintegration chamber
the hooded man felt appalled at the
sheer animal hate in her violet eyes her
skin was too light for her to be a full
blooded jovian primitive she must be
a cross he mentally snapped his fingers
that was it of course the blue venus
the slave for whom hal bemmelman was
asking five thousand monad on the venu-
sian slave mart he said

  you arent overly fond of bemmel-
man

  i loathe him with a savage jerk
she yanked her white negligee down from
her left shoulder see that

  he saw a scar on the pale blue skin above
her breast it was the shape of a fern
leaf and he could have covered it with his
thumb

  branded she spat my father was
a jovian dawn man-an animal but my
mother was an earth woman hal bem-
melman kidnapped her

  the hooded man regarded her pityingly
she was only a kid he realized he said
you cant get bemmelman like that
he runs the government at venusport
hed never come to trial he stopped
realizing that she wasnt listening

  nostrils flaring head erect the girl was
looking through him blankly a glimmer
of fright flitted across her mobile features
then she raised the dart gun pointed it
full at his chest

  put your hands on top of your head
please

  his green eyes contracted angrily he
didnt move

  i mean it put your hands on top of
your head please

  with a shrug he obeyed he saw the
door to the corridor slide back a heavy
red faced man in his late forties and a
wrinkled snuff brown suit stared in at
them the red faced mans sparse sandy
hair was plastered to his skull and he
had little mobile brown eyes like a pig

  is that you hal the blue girl
didnt turn around didnt take her eyes
off the hooded man ive caught the
renegade

  the red faced mans jaw dropped
yes sir he said yes sir its me sofi
a shrewd gleam flickered in his pig-like
eyes

  i caught him trying to open the safe
so i see so i see bemmelman
rubbed his hands together came into the
room he pulled a dart gun from the
belly band of his trousers and leveled it
at the renegade stand aside sofi
the hooded man felt his stomach turn
slowly upside down he considered hurl-
self behind the glassite desk snatching
out his slug gun

  bemmelman said did you get his gun
sofi

  she shook her yellow head
the blue vews	

  alarm stiffened the planters features
get it girl no no dont get be-
tween us get behind him

  the hooded man felt the girls hands
pat his chest draw forth the heavy slug
gun

  the florid -color crept back into bem-
melmans gross features you may go
sofi i want a word with the renegade

sofi shot him a child-like pouting
glance but retreated obediently from
the room drawing the door shut behind
her

 the lean young man in the hood
watched weighing his chances he didnt
say anything

  youre surprised eh that i dont turn
you in to the security patrol bemmel-
man began theyd like to get their hands
on the renegade they would but the
fact is i want you more than they do
yes sir this is a piece of luck for me
ive been trying to contact you for months
the hooded man said dryly im lis-
tening and allowed his hands to sink
to his side

  put your hands back on your head
bemmelmans voice registered alarm no
tricks i can use you lad but no tricks
he glared speculatively at the renegade
added yes sir that i can and now if
youll take off that hood well get down to
business

i f its business ill keep the hood on
no sir the planter blustered off
with the hood or i shoot when i do
business with a man i like to know who
he is

  the hooded mans green eyes were reck-
less the law on venus was harsh im-
placable there were no pardons the
disintegration chamber at venusport
yawned for him inexorably

  you know bemmelman id be com-
pletely at your mercy if i unmasked
you are right now yes sir you
can take it off alive or ill take it off of
you dead

  the hooded man was half crouched
against the glassite desk he said softly
you dont leave me much choice and
dived beneath the dart gun

  his head struck the slave breeders
paunch like a cannon ball bemmelman
went ooof sat down with a thud the

dart gun spat a needle into the ceiling
where it quivered viciously

  the hooded man was on him like a cat
one swipe of his hand knocked the dart gun
clattering under the sofa purple faced
gasping bemmelman scrambled to his feet
a look of fright swept his gross features
and he began stabbing a button on the
glassite desk

  the hooded man could hear the shrill
clamor of alarm bells pealing through the
rambling building he leaped for the
door threw it back

  ahhh he said

  sofi stood in the entrance her dart gun
almost against his chest

  like a whip the hooded man twisted
sideways snatched the gun from the
startled girl he saw bemmelman charging
across the room he grinned shoved the
girl into the planters arms slammed the
door

  the sound of shouts drifted up to him
he saw a venusian serf armed with a
bell muzzled ray rifle dash into the cor-
ridor the serf caught sight of him a
yellow ray streamed from the gun splashed
off the wall but the hooded man already
had vanished up the stairs

  bemmelman burst from the office
which way did he go  the force screens
are up he cant escape

  he got in sofi pointed out coolly

  half a dozen armed serfs dashed into
the hall the alarm bells were still ring-
ing

  which way bemmelman roared

  the serf said up

  weve got him that leads to the roof
he cant get off he charged the steps
followed by the pack of venusians

  at the room bemmelman paused shoved
up the trap with considerable respect
for his own skin he ordered one of the
serfs through first

  careful he advised the mans
desperate

  the serf climbed fatalistically onto the
roof turned around and around

  hes not here

  impossible the planter roared and
squeezed his bulk through the opening

  the green phosphorescent glow of the
vegetation lit the flat roof eerily a rau-
cous screech from some night flying bird
floated down from the cloud mass overhead
	planet stories

there was no plane no sign of a plane
but the man with the hood was gone

mia maciver tried to concentrate on
her head overseers report she felt
hot and sticky and the figures ran together
didnt make sense moreover the deli-
cate notes of a flute kept scattering her
thoughts they came through the case-
ment window from the patio outside her
study

  damn said mia maclver and wrig-
gled at her desk

  she was barefooted clad only in a short
yellow tunic but she felt as if she were
locked in a steam bath shed never get
used to venus she supposed to its turkish
bath atmosphere its lush phosphorescent
vegetation its ridiculous mingling of
periods paleozoic mesozoic and the glass
age all flourishing together the pan-like
notes continued to assail her ears from out-
side the study

  she wrinkled her nose wiped a trickle
of sweat from the end in despair she
flipped on the newscaster

  the features of a plump young man
flashed on the screen

  last night his voice came through
the audio the plantation of councilor
bemmelman was raided by the renegade
luckily he was discovered immediately
and the security patrol notified but as
usual the renegade had vanished without
a trace

  mia maclver snapped to attention it
was absurd she felt with a surge of anger
that a man could make fools of the venu-
sian authorities as the renegade had done
for years

  she knew little of venus her life had
been spent in boarding schools on earth
but when shed received news that her
father was dead murdered by the rene-
gade shed booked passage to venusport
at once determined to manage the planta-
tion herself

  heres a special bulletin the an-
nouncer was saying the plantation
owners are subscribing ten thousand
monads to be added to the price already
on the renegades head that makes a
total of fifty thousand monads for his cap-
ture a punitive expedition is also being

organized against his headquarters in the
cloud mountains

  mia maclver switched off the news-
caster stood up the notes of the pipes
drifted into her study exotic compelling
she bit her lip stepped through the win-
dow onto the vine roofed patio

  stop that noise cosmo youre driv-
ing me insane

  cosmo horn took the venusian pipes
from his mouth said dryly i didnt think
i was that bad

  he was sprawled in a hammock look-
ing like a handsome rather distinguished
tramp

  did you hear the newscaster cosmo
no he shook his head he had a
lean hawk-like visage close cropped brown
hair green eyes

  the renegade was at the bemmelman
plantation last night

  sure enough

  cosmo sat up put the reeds in his pocket
he was wearing only coat and trousers
the brown triangle of hair on his chest
extended in a thin line down his flat belly
how much did he nick that dealer in
flesh for

  nothing they scared him off before
he had a chance to take anything cosmo
why cant they catch him

  no ones seen him without his hood
they dont know who he is they dont
know where to look or what tolook for
oh earth    began mia

  on earth there wouldnt be a rene-
gade interrupted cosmo dryly earth
is unified it isnt split up into hundreds
of independent countries like venus they
dont have slavery or serfdom or the feudal
system on earth men arent driven into
outlawry  

driven said mia in a heated voice
what makes you think he was driven
id say he was doing exactly as he pleased
cosmo stood up towering over the girl
took several short paces across the patio

  i dont think anyone would enjoy be-
ing constantly hunted everymans hand
against him always on guard against
treachery surprise and no matter how
careful he is sooner or later hes bound
to be caught he cant even quit now
i feel sorry for him

  feel sorry for him id like to see him
shot

osmo looked startled youre a
blood thirsty little devil he grinned
suddenly what ive been saying must
have buzzed in one ear and out the other
mia said he murdered father
cosma regarded her in surprise great
guns mia where did you get that idea
hal bemmelman told me he found
father down in the tara field where   
her voice faltered but she recovered her-
self went on where the serfs had
hacked him to pieces with grass knives
they were the renegades men

  did he did he indeed cosmos
voice was grim what was bemmelman
doing there

  mia frowned he was trailing a runa-
way serf why 

  of course he was her gray eyes
widened she stared at him surely you
arent accusing bemmelman of murdering
father why hes the most influential
member of the council of land owners
hes   

  did you ever hear of the blue venus
he interrupted

  the blue venus whats that
cosmos face was grim his green eyes
cold shes a cross between a jovian
dawn man and an earth woman shes
supposed to be the most beautiful girl in
the system she belongs to bemmelman
he forced her mother to mate with a
jovian primitive as an experiment hes
asking five thousand monad for her on
the slave mart hal bemmelman is a
slave breeder

  i dont believe it mia said in hor-
ror then asked with feminine perversity
how do you know

  cosmo sat down in the hammock
grinned faintly im going to tell you
something ive never told anyone but your
father mia i think you ought to know
because youre in danger his green
eyes twinkled quit chewing your fin-
gernails

  go on said mia go on for the
lords sake before i burst

  he said twenty-six years ago my
father owned the bemmelman plantation
he was murdered under almost the same
circumstances as your father so was my
mother my nurse escaped with me hid
me out in the mountains i was only five
who did it

stories

  jovian dawn men slaves imported
from jupiter they run amok during their
rutting season you know and they were
supposed to be amok at the time

  but    began mia

  wait a moment bemmelman held
notes on the plantation he moved in
but before bemmelman took over our
plantation he was a slave runner he
imported dawn men from jupiter for the
venusian slave mart

  you-you think hal bemmelman was
in back of it

   yes he said flatly

  but why couldnt he buy land
no said cosmo he couldnt land
here is entailed it stays in the same
family from generation to generation mu
is one of the few countries on venus
where terrans have been able to settle
at all bemmelmans only chance was to
have my people murdered and forge notes
does he know who you are

  cosmo nodded hes tried to have me
assassinated several times he said in-
differently

  mia swallowed you-you said i was
in danger

  doesnt it strike you theres a great
deal of similarity between your case and
mine your father has been murdered
supposedly by the renegade it looks like
bemmelman is getting ready to expand
he-he wouldnt kill me said mia
indignantly would he

  no said cosmo a smile quirking
the corners of his wide grim-lipped
mouth his lean narrow jaw and thin
hooked nose gave him a saturnine cast
but i wouldnt put it past him to kidnap
you remember the blue venus i hap-
pen to know bemmelmans been anxious
to repeat that experiment but a beautiful
terran girl is hard to get

  she shivered slightly said thats
preposterous he wouldnt dare would
he

  but cosmo had leaped to his feet
theres a plane coming he said in an
edgy voice

  a surface flying car flashed to the edge
of the patio stopped settled to the ground
the extreme altitude of the bullet-shaped
vehicle was under three hundred feet
cosmo knew but even that height was
impractical for flight on venus roofed as
the blue venus



the planet was by the low swirling cloud
blanket as a rule the planes barely
skimmed the surface

  a door in the monoloid hull swung
open a heavy set man got out

  why its hal bemmelman exclaimed
mia what does he want

  speak of the devil drawled cosmo

bemmelman strode across the pa-
tio his eyes on cosmo said in a
disagreeable voice if it isnt the forti-
eth-century troubadour

  cosmos features set blankly he didnt
reply

  mia bemmelman took both the girls
hands in his big paws ive bad news
yes sir very bad news three of my
serfs ganged my second overseer chopped
him to pieces with grass knives

  what mias eyes dilated in horror
they got him from behind i guess
then they broke into the arsenal theyre
armed mia and heading this way i
dropped everything to fly over and warn
you

  coming this way mia firmly dis-
engaged her hands but why

  theyre trying to reach the cloud
mountains and join the renegade your
place lies directly between mine and the
mountains

  the renegade mias level gray eyes
frosted with hate the rurals cant catch
him he makes monkeys out of the
security patrol what is he  a wizard 
youve heard the news bemmelman
interrupted the renegade was at my
place last night ive been worried about
you mia alone here on the edge of the
mountains yes sir i came to take you
to my plantation until we have these mur-
derous serfs behind bars

  but im quite safe i-i   

  this isnt earth mia he said in a
silky voice i havent much time no
sir i must return to organize the pursuit
well teach those brutes a lesson they
wont soon forget

  if you catch them put in cosmo in
an amused voice

  well catch them bemmelman turned
his small brown pig-like eyes on cosmo
yes sir and the renegade too

  mia said with a grimace thanks
hal but im not coming

  bemmelman lowered his head like a
bull i havent the men to spare to
guard you even if i could trust them
i was too good a friend of your fathers
mia to leave you here with those three
murderers roaming in the neighborhood
youre coming with me

  cosmo observing quietly frowned to
himself what was the planter trying to
pull

  im not said mia indignantly
really this is preposterous its   

  bemmelman glared at her seized her
arm girl dont be a fool if those
runaways show up here theyd chop you
to pieces come along unceremoni-
ously he began to drag her toward his
plane

  cosmo mias gray eyes snapped
open like saucers

  cosmos hand fell on bemmelmans
shoulder spun him around

 you heard miss maclver two
rouge-like spots sprang out on cosmos
high cheek bones his green eyes were
opaque

  get your dirty paws off me bemmel-
man roared in surprise he almost choked
with rage by jupiter ill teach you
a lesson you wont soon forget yes sir

  with a growl the red-faced planter
lashed out with his fist the blow struck
cosmo on his right cheek bone snapped
back his head

  you shouldnt have done that said
cosmo he turned loose bemmelmans
shoulder

  the planter swung again wildly cosmo
slipped the blow with a straight left he
knocked bemmelman down

  the planter shook his head there was
a surprised look on his beefy red features
sinking his head in his bull neck he
scrambled to his feet

  cosmo knocked him down again

  bemmelman turned his brown pig-like
eyes up to cosmo he tried to rise
cosmo knocked him down for the third
time

  he said bemmelman get out of here
if you ever lay hands to me again ill
kill you

  the planter heaved himself to his feet
lip drooling blood he crossed to his sur-
face plane scrambled inside then he
shook his fist at cosmo


planet

stories

  ill get you for this horn you
havent maclver to protect you now ill
get you

  cosmo took a step toward the plane

  bemmelman hastily slammed the door
the vehicle swooped from the ground
sped away like a silver bullet

  he will said mia in a small voice 
you shouldnt have done that cosmo
hes powerful he controls the council
of land owners

  he struck me cosmos lean fea-
tures were like clay if he does it again
ill kill him

  mia shivered do you always get so
violent 

  he hit me said cosmo i should
have killed him

  all at once mia said cosmo in a
strained frightened voice

  he flicked a glance past the startled
girl stiffened in alarm at the edge of
the patio three men stood in a silent
group

  one he saw was a serf naked to the
waist the venusian was darker squatter
than the fozoqls the killer caste of venus
but he had the same venomous green eyes
a grass knife was thrust through his
sash and he held a ray rifle at a menacing
angle

  it was the second figure though that
took his breath away a huge naked blue
giant his only weapon was a club

  a jovian dawn man said mia in a
stifled voice

  cosmo felt his palms dampen the ter-
rific gravity of jupiter endowed the jovian
primitives with superhuman strength
normally they were docile creatures and
highly prized among the venusians as
slaves because of their terrible strength
and weird beauty the dawn man faced
them now nostrils flaring as he tested their
scent he was handsome as a matinee idol
but somewhere the jovians had run into
an evolutionary blind pocket they would
never evolve into true men they were
animals

  cosmo scarcely noted the third member
of the group the short barrel - shaped
mercurian he stood a little apart smil-
ing blandly and quietly like an inscrutable
buddha

  look at the scars on their shoulders
mia whispered hoarsely the fern leaf

thats bemmelmans brand theyre the
runaways

  the venusian raised his rifle his
green eyes burned with hate for the earth-
lings

  mia shrank toward cosmo he -
hes

  put down your rifle said cosmo in
the venusian dialect of mu he could feel
the pulse beat in his ears his lips felt
dry seek you the renegade

  the venusian hesitated indecision re-
flected in his dark-yellow features the
dawn man shook his club growled deep
in his chest muscles rippled like hawsers
beneath his blue hide

  most certainly it was the mercurian
who spoke

  cosmo glanced at him shatply realized
that behind the mercurians smiling mask
he was violently distressed mercurians
didnt approve of bloodshed he recalled

  sweat dappled cosmos forehead then
with a faint shrug he made a peculiar
gesture with his hand

  an expression of wonder and compre-
hension filled their faces only the blue
giant continued to rumble deep in his
chest

  the renegade cried the fat mer-
curian and his yellow eyes twinkled with
relief he plumped on his knees repeated
the cabalistic symbol

  with only a moments hesitation the serf
followed suit down you big ox he
shouted at the jovian and thwacked him
behind the knees with his ray rifle down
thats the renegade

ill

ia mac iver stared at cosmo in
disbelief you - youre not the
renegade i dont believe it

  its lucky for you i am he said
dryly

  she held her hands straight down at her
side small fists clenched lucky
father thought you were his friend and
you killed him id rather be dead than
owe you anything

  listen mia get this straight i didnt
kill your father

  of course youd say that her chin
trembled she set her jaw stubbornly
whod believe the renegade
the blue venus



    cosmo made a weary gesture turned

-	back to the runaways whod been listening
  with interest

    get off your knees he said his tone
  was embarrassed the security patrol
  is scouring the countryside for you right
  now take to the forest where the planes
  cant follow make for the mountains
  my men  

    by nemi the buddha - faced mer-
  curian ejaculated suddenly he pointed
  at mia who was slipping through the win-
  dow to her study the girl is escaping
  after her tong

    the venusian serf leaped in pursuit but
  cosmo halted him with a lifted hand
  she wont go far he turned back to the
  mercurian i give the orders he said

    the moon-faced little man bowed good-
  naturedly cosmo realized he wasnt even
  armed

    what are you doing with this pair of
  cut-throats he asked

    we understand one another the mer-
  curian replied blandly i act as a gov-
  ernor my presence restrains them from
  indulging in an excess of blood letting
  who sent you to me cosmo asked
  shrewdly was it penang-ihtok 

   the mercurian shuddered yes a
  violent man that penang-ihtok an out-
  cast fozoql

    hes safe then cosmo interrupted
  bemmelman doesnt suspect him

    no

    good he frowned said go now
  your time is short

    without a word the odd trio filed off
  cosmo watched them around the corner of
  the plantation house then sprang through
  the window of mias study

    the girl was at the telecast she had
  tuned in the fat commissioner of the
  security patrol

   what the commissioners voice
  rumbled from the audio his jowls were
  shaking his image wildly agitated are
  you sure owner maclver  the renegade
  at your plantation with the serfs from the
  bemmelman place

    without waiting for an answer he
  turned away from the visoscreen but cos-
  mo could still hear his voice shouting orders
  at some underling

    contact the radio patrol planes or-

   -planet stories-spring

der them to converge on the maclver
plantation the renegade good lord
man dya realize what a feather itll be
in our caps hurry

  the fat commissioner swung back into
the visoscreen ill have a dozen patrol
planes there in ten minutes what does
he look like owner maclver who is
he

  he is   began mia then discovered
cosmo standing beside the boxlike trans-
mitter on the wall he flashed her a faintly
wolfish grin

mia gasped brought her hand to her
throat her high firm breasts heaved
wildly beneath the yellow tunic

  whats wrong owner maclver 
whats wrong came the excited voice
from the audio

  mias wide gray eyes brimmed with hate

  he is   she began again but the
screen went dead cosmo had yanked the
transmitter from the wall wires like
tentacles dangled from the back of the box
he dropped it to the gray straw matting

  that wont help mias voice was
triumphant as she backed away you
cant escape theyll come from all direc-
tions

  again cosmo grinned he jumped
siezed mia swung her off her feet

  let me go

  youre coming with me his voice
was grim id rather the commissioner
didnt find out im the renegade just
yet

  put me down are you mad mias
long bare legs thrashed wildly she ham-
mered at his chest you cant escape
by yourself let alone with me

  he calmly pinioned her flailing legs
strode out the window to the edge of the
patio dropping her to her feet he
fumbled in his pocket drew forth a whistle
put it to his lips blew

  no audible sound resulted the note
was too high too shrill to be detected by
human ears

  mia maclver quit squirming gaped at
him blankly

  cosmos eyes searched the dense pearl
gray cloud ceiling he blew twice more
on the soundless whistle

  there was a disturbance in the cloud
layer directly overhead as if tremen-
	planet

dous fans were boiling the impenetrable
fleecy ceiling into a froth then a huge
grotesque shape plummeted from the clouds
with back flailing wings the monster set-
tled to the ground

  mia screamed tried to squirm free

  let me go let me go

  its just a bird he assured her

  just a bird hell mia shuddered
that things a nightmare what is it

  an ormoo

  the ormoo cocked its red-brown eye at
cosmo rubbed its gunmetal gray beak
against his leg emitted a pleased raucous
squawk

  mia flinched the beak looked capable
of severing cosmos leg like a twig from
wing tip to wing tip the ormoo extended
over sixty feet its pearl gray plumage
was a perfect camouflage as it drifted
through venus eternal cloud blanket

  down shouted cosmo

  the ormoo crouched to its breast like
a hen setting on her eggs a saddle was
strapped to its back

  cosmo cried mia in terror strug-
gling to wrench free

  the ormoo cocked its head again eyed
the frantic girl gravely as a robin might
watch a beetle

  my god cosmo that thing wants to
eat me ill-ill have hysterics

  he laughed flung her astride the saddle
holding onto her naked ankle he vaulted
up behind

  up he shouted

  the ormoo lurched to its feet it took
a few ungainly steps launched itself into
the air with a powerful drive of its legs
the massive wings lashed the air like
flails as it spiraled upward

  mia clung to cosmo with terror

  take me back cosmo i wont tell
the commissioner youre the renegade
ill lie like a martian diplomat only make
this monstrosity go down please cosmo

  he put an arm about her waist steadying
her

  dont be frightened he wont hurt
you so long as im here

  the hell you say said mia between
chattering teeth i tell you that bird
considers me in the same light as a juicy
worm

  already the tenuous mist was closing
around them the ormoo still spiraled

stories

upward cosmo saw a patrol flash by be-
neath them pause like a humming bird
over the patio another then another
streaked in from different directions

  mia maclver leaned over all at once
shrieked in a despairing voice help
help

  you little wretch cosmo grinned
clapped his hand over her mouth she bit
him

  he jerked his hand away before she
could cry out again the wool-like cloud
blanket smothered them everything dis-
appeared in moist white fleece mia
slumped forlornly in cosmos powerful
arm

  home cosmo shouted

  the giant bird wheeled off at an angle
wings beating with the rhythmic swish of
waves lapping at a beach guided by some
peculiar sixth sense it headed by the short-
est route for the cloud mountains

  for a while the avhish-swish of the
ormoos wings was the only sound it
was like flying through a warm blinding
blizzard

  does it know where its going mia
twisted about in cosmos arm curiosity
overcoming her terror already her brown
piquant features dripped with moisture
her damp yellow tunic clung to her pli-
ant figure like skin

  yes the patrol planes cant navigate
in these clouds but the ormoo can it
flys by instinct

  she relaxed laid her damp black curls
against his shoulder

  cosmo why did you turn renegade

  her attitude had undergone such an
about face that his green eyes hardened
warily

  its a long story

  mia snuggled deeper in his arms was
it because your father and mother were
killed and bemmelman stole your planta-
tion 

  that was part of it my nurse fled
with me to the cloud mountains the
jovians trailed us hunted us for months
then we fell in with a party of outlaws
they were rough men but kind i didnt
understand much that was happening at
the time but later i managed to piece it
together i swore id make bemmelman
pay

  he laughed mirthlessly it was no use
the blue venus	

the authorities werent interested in hear-
ing anything against him i thought
maybe if i could get concrete evidence
that would force them to act i broke into
his manor house i was discovered but
i got away i was wearing a hood to con-
ceal my features the newscasters played
it up the hooded man the renegade
i suddenly found myself notorious-an
outlaw

  but you raided other plantations you
stirred up the serfs she couldnt keep
the edge of hate and accusation out of her
voice

  some he admitted with a grin
though we preyed on other outlaws prin-
cipally but whenever the security patrol
couldnt solve a crime they laid it to the
renegade the list is astounding murder
rapine theft he chuckled grimly ive
even been credited with committing two
killings at the same time over five hun-
dred miles apart

  but even if you get bemmelman mia
pointed out what can you gain youre
still an outlaw youll be sent to the dis-
integration chamber

  oh theyll get me someday he replied
coolly but first ill drag down bem-
melman

the ormoo flew steadily strongly
presently the girl said

  does the ormoo really understand your
commands 

  a few simple ones

  would it obey me

  try it

  down cried mia

  the ormoo plummeted toward the sur-
face mia clapped her hands shrieked
up its wings thundered as it gained
altitude again

  she twisted around in the saddle it
obeys me she laughed infectiously she
placed her hands as if to steady herself
on cosmos shoulder all at once her gray
eyes contracted she gave him a tremen-
dous push

  caught completely by surprise cosmo
lunged desperately for the saddle missed
he felt himself slipping faster and faster
on the birds wet back there he went
over with a rush

  his wildly grabbing hand slid down
mias bare leg like a drowning man

clutching at a straw his fingers closed about
her ankle

  mia gave a shriek of terror rolled over
on her stomach hugged the saddle

  let go she yelled youre pulling
me off she kicked wildly at the man
dangling pendulum-like from her foot

  cosmo grunted he pulled himself up
grabbed her leg just above the calf
thrusting his free hand into the ormoos
feathers he seized a large quill inched him-
self upward

  mia was too busy hanging to the saddle
to kick at him she lay stomach down
across the ormoos back clinging with the
strength of panic

  cosmo released her leg got a grip on
her tunic it parted halfway up her back
leaving him dangling wildly from the huge
quill he caught her leg again strained
upward until he could grasp the saddle
and heave himself astride

  he sat there trembling with exhaustion
panting

  mia still lay stomach down across the
saddle sobbing with frustration there
were red finger weals on ankle calf and
thigh where cosmos iron fingers had dug
into her flesh

  he flashed her his sudden grin you
little devil he panted i ought to dangle
you over the ormoos side see how youd
like it

  a shudder passed through the girl i
hate you i hate you she sobbed in
frustrated rage

  there was a soothing tempo to the swish-
lift of the giant ormoos flight mia dozed
as the miles fled past slumped against
cosmos chest

  then unexpectedly the bird wheeled
flapped sharply upward its huge wing
tips brushed the face of a cliff fog
swirled whipped into froth by the frenzied
wings

  mia maclver awakened in terror clung
to cosmo pressed her damp quivering body
against him the bird wheeled again and
again always gaining altitude

  were in the mountains of the clouds
cosmos green eyes glittered well be
at the roost any moment

  it was colder mia shivered then
the ormoo began to settle wings thrash-
ing it came to rest with a jar

  nothing was visible but cloud thick
	planet stories

clinging the mountains thrusting up
into venus cloud sheath were perpetually
mantled with the gray vapor the deep
throated roar of a waterfall beat at their
ears like thunder

  cosmo slid off the ormoos back
shouted at mia to jump his voice was
drowned in the waterfall a dash of
spray struck his face

  he felt for her ankle yanked she
came tumbling into his arms with a scream
cosmo laughed bore her lightly across the
jumble of sticks which was the ormoos
nest down a long slippery flight of steps
descending into the chasm spray drenched
them both the roar was unbearable

  he paused fumbled at a section of the
cliff a door swung inward revealing
a long low chamber hewn from the living
rock

  cosmo carried the wet and shivering girl
across the threshold

  fog swirled about them like steam from
a turkish bath he set her on her feet
shut the door the roar of the waterfall
was blotted out only the hising of gas
jets which lighted the chamber disturbed
the silence

  my private entrance he surveyed
his prize the wet yellow tunic revealed
every subtle curve youre a handsome
wench mia

  mia maclver frowned entrance to
what 

  the renegades abode the moun-
tains honeycombed with caves come on
but mia hung back dubiously what
are you going to do with me

  he eyed the suspicious girl said
solemnly oh the usual thing

  the usual thing  she swallowed
thats what i was afraid of

 ure easily resigned he ob-
x served dryly and urged her toward
the door at the rear of the chamber you
need to get out of that wet tunic he
grinned regarded the rent in the back
of the garment it isnt doing its duty
any longer anyway

  i think youre horrible she grabbed
the tear together sidled crabwise through
the door her cheeks hot

  cosmo followed chuckling a long nar-
row corridor burrowed ahead of them
straight into the heart of the mountain

flaring gas jets hissed at regular inter-
vals along the walls

  all at once the grin was wiped from his
face he seized mias arm said hold
it

  mia bit her lip gasped

  three men had edged into the corridor
from a bisecting passage they were huge
almost seven feet tall with skin a vivid
blue they were quite naked and the
muscles bulged beneath their blue hides

  jovian dawn men mia whispered
my god theyre running amok

  cosmo felt the cold breath of death blow
up his spine his hand slid automatically
to his shoulder holster it was empty
with a curse he remembered that it had
been taken by the blue venus her dart
gun hed tossed aside once free of the
bemmelman plantation

  the three naked giants minced daintily
closer nostrils flaring as they caught their
scent theyre not amok he said over
his shoulder the rutting season is
months off yet theres something else
behind this

  mia said with incredulity look at
their left shoulders see that scar the
fern leaf thats hal bemmelmans
brand cosmo those are bemmelmans
slaves

  the blue giants crouched their violet
eyes were passionless their handsome faces
calm inscrutable

  back cosmo suddenly shouted in a
tone of authority and took a step toward
them a low snarl rumbled in their
throats then like cats on a mouse they
pounced

  mia screamed

  cosmo kicked one of them in the belly
heard him grunt with balled fist he
swung at the placid handsome features of
the second blue giant pain like a hot
iron shot up his arm from his bruised
knuckles the jovian shook his head
grabbed cosmos wrist jerked his arm
felt as if it were being tom from the
socket

  he kicked slugged the emotionless face
with his free hand the grip never relaxed
he heard mia scream again like a rabbit
in a steel trap

  then the jovian clouted him brutally
alongside the temple with his open-fist
cosmos head snapped sideways like a
the blue venus	to

punching bag his knee collapsed he
seemed to be falling into the chasm of
the waterfall down down into stygian
blackness

iv

cosmo gradually became aware of a
jolting swaying movement at each
jolt a flash of pain shot across his eyes
he sat up cracked his skull against some-
thing solid a blinding pain jolted him
into full consciousness

  he was in a cage he saw swung on
poles like a litter between two of the blue
giants they were jogging along through
a forest

  at once he became aware of warmth
along his side twisted his head mia was
regarding him from wide frightened eyes
theyd been tumbled side by side into
the cage the girl was almost naked her
yellow tunic in tatters

  you hurt he asked

  she shook her head

  he closed his eyes against the ache in
his skull if the pain would only let up
his mind felt fuzzy his thoughts inco-
herent

  whew that brute sure gave me a
wallop what happened 

  he could feel mia shiver against him
it was dreadful she said they
grabbed me-ugh-and stuffed me in this
cage they had it hidden outside on the
trail from the ormoos nest then they
dumped you in on top of me like a bag
of flour i-i thought you were dead

  so did i said cosmo dryly

  she regarded him dubiously said they
picked up the cage then and began to
run down the trail they carried us over
the most impossible places always down
i died with fright just a little while ago
we came out into the forest

  i know the trail he said nothing
but jovian primitives could have managed
it i wonder why bemmelman didnt have
me killed outright

  bemmelman mia looked puzzled
sure theyre his slaves you saw
the fern leaf brand on their shoulders we
walked straight into a trap

  but thats impossible how could they
have found your hideout

cosmo shook his head and immediately

regretted it one of my men must be a
spy bemmelmans shrewder than ive
given him credit for being

  a spy mias eyes grew round as
saucers but why

  i dont know unless hes after that
fifty thousand monad reward on my head 
he frowned bemmelman said something
odd last night when he caught me in his
house he said hed been trying to get
in touch with me

  the blue giants swung effortlessly
through the incredible forest the trees
were like cathedral columns disappearing
in the swirling cloud blanket

  you said wed walked into a trap
insisted mia how could bemmelman
know when youd get back i dont un-
derstand

  cosmo snorted anybody could guess
id head for my hideout after the alarm at
your place most likely bemmelman
tipped that judas of his by radio when
to expect me the dawn men are ani-
mals they hunt by scent that fellow
must have given them a piece of my
clothing planted them in the corridor it
was as simple as that

  but what does bemmelman want with
me she wailed

  dont forget the blue venus i told
you hed been trying to duplicate that ex-
periment

  i dont believe it said mia in a shocked
voice he wouldnt dare would he
whats to hinder him at venusport
theyll think the renegade abducted you
whod suspect that the eminent councillor
bemmelman had hijacked me

  i dont believe it she repeated in-
dignantly youre just trying to throw
mud on him because you think he mur-
dered your parents and stole your planta-
tion its-its an obsession you have
no proof

  cosmo regarded her with cloudy green
eyes i had the intersteller investigation
bureau dig out his past ive a man in
bemmelmans household right now i
know he looked through the bars of
the cage they were approaching the
edge of the forest he turned back said
something besides slave breeding is go-
ing on at bemmelmans there are parts
of the plantation where my man never has
been able to penetrate
	planet

  what do you think it is mias voice
was a whisper

  i dont know but hasnt it occurred
to you that slave breeding must entail a
slow turnover a child isnt marketable
until its sixteen or seventeen at least
what are you driving at

  suppose bemmelman has discovered
some way to speed up growth-to hasten
maturity

  an aging process its-its impos-
sible

  he shook his head plants are forced
why not animals

  the blue giants he saw had broken
through the last of the trees into a lush
meadow of mauve fen grass

  look mia he pointed toward the
center of the meadow the second lap
of our journey is provided for our kid-
napper shows considerable foresight

   in the center of the meadow a small sur-
face plane rested on the fen grass like a
silver bullet there was no sign of life
inside or out 

tts deserted said mia in surprise
a cosmo frowned but didnt reply
the jovian dawn men trotted straight
to the empty plane they opened a door
in the side shoved them within cage and
all cosmo heard the door click shut the
dawn men had not followed them inside

  he glanced curiously about the interior
all the seats had been removed even
the pilots chair

  wheres the pilot asked mia in a
subdued voice

  he shook his head through the port
he could see the blue giants disappearing
among the trees

   just then the plane gave a jerk

  its moving with a shriek mia flung
herself onto cosmo

   he felt the plane lurch again then shoot
upward at a hundred feet it leveled
itself off darted away on what he judged
to be a southerly course there was still
no evidence of a pilot

  mia maclver held onto cosmo like a
drowning man to a straw as the pilotless
plane hurtled southward

  he drew a long breath robot pilot
he patted her shoulder theres nothing
supernatural about it

  mia pulled herself away i didnt mean

stories

to throw myself on you like that i  i

    she halted lamely

   dont apologize cosmo flashed her
 his quick wolfish grin i enjoyed it
 youve been hurling yourself at me at
 fairly regular intervals all day

   i think youre horrid mias cheeks
 colored but her gray eyes twinkled

   mia he said serious all at once if
 bemmelman-er-disposes of me youll
 have to contact my man yourself i told
 you i had a spy planted in his household
 his name is penang-ihtok

   she looked suddenly startled

   hes a venusian an outcast fozoql
 you can recognize him by the blue star
 tattooed on his forehead tell him that
 my orders are to have the men raid bem-
 melmans plantation and carry you to
 venusport

   penang-ihtok she repeated

   of course he added dryly im hope-
 ful bemmelman wont kill me right off
 and i can contact penang-ihtok myself
 in which case you wont need to bother
 your pretty head about it

   he yawned stretched out as comfortably
 as he could arrange himself in their con-
 fined quarters closed his eyes

   youre not going to sleep exploded
 mia in alarm

  certainly nothing else to do he
 patted his shoulder make yourself com-
 fortable

   she eyed him with suspicion

  go ahead i havent any designs on
 you he said dryly

   well you dont need to be so assertive
 about it said mia and laid her head
 gingerly on his shoulder

  sure said cosmo he was staring
 at the roof of the cage

   presently she said in a sleepy voice i
 havent leprosy either in case youre wor-
 ried

   of course not

   mia muttered something unladylike un-
 der her breath

   whats that

   i think said mia distinctly that
 youre a worm

  cosmo chuckled the plane continued
 to steer itself arrow-like into the south of
 mu

 a faint jerk brought cosmo wide awake
 as some jungle animal the plane he
the blue venus



realized had stopped settled to venus

-	it was night the green phosphores-
cent light of the luminous vegetation
flooded through the port holes from
somewhere the sound of a muffled bell
ringing ringing reached his ears

  through the port he could see a cor-
ner of a tower part of a slate roof the
grotesque arms of a telo-antenna sprouted
from the peak of the tower he heard a
door squeal open the hell sounded
louder then it stopped to be replaced by
the mutter of voices approaching

  wake up he shook mia maclver
gently

  she opened her eyes stared at him in
bewilderment where are we

  shhh

  the door opened cosmo caught sight
of bemmelmans gross features in the
opening he looked ghastly in the phos-
phorescent glow beyond him reared an
immense gray pile of a building

   the planters jaw dropped in disbelief
as he recognized his captives then a tide
of red swept up from his bull-like neck

  you he shouted what the hell
are you doing in there

  didnt you know said cosmo dryly
im trying to cure myself of claustro-
phobia

   but already a shrewd gleam of triumph
had replaced the disappointment in bem-
melmans pig-like brown eyes

  youre the renegade he rubbed his
hands together began to grin yes sir
youre the renegade i should have
guessed it before and you mia he
threw back his head roared until the court
reverberated with his heavy laughter

   let us in on the joke said cosmo

  bemmelman stopped laughing wiped his
eyes two birds with one stone i
didnt expect to catch both of you in the
same trap no sir that i didnt he
stepped back clapped his hands

two naked blue dawn men appeared
hauled forth the cage shouldered it
with bemmelman following they bore
it across the court into a doorway at the
base of the lichen covered tower

   i feel perfectly ridiculous whispered
mia bouncing around in the cage thank
goodness none of my friends can see me

  cosmo chuckled shot a glance after

bemmelman who was crossing the floor to
an intercommunicating telecast the room
appeared to be a guard room weapons
were racked against the walls and a dozen
naked blue giants lay sleeping on the floor
these raised their handsome classical
heads surveyed the captives from incuri-
ous violet eyes cosmo put his lips against
mias ear said

  remember penang-ihtok

  he heard bemmelman say switch on
the current in the tower send liana to
me at once

a voice from the audio replied right
from the corner of his eye cosmo saw
a sheet of flame sear across the door
leading to the court beyond then it
vanished

   force screen he guessed

  bemmelman approached grinning ami-
ably he was wearing a snuff brown
suit which set on him like a sack

  dont try to escape cautioned the
planter as he inserted a slender key in
the spring lock threw back the top of
the cage youd be electrocuted if you
went through any of the outside doors or
windows

  cosmo and mia stood up shakily

   we wont bolt if thats what you mean
cosmo replied dryly he glanced at the
handsome impassive blue giants discarded
any idea of attacking bemmelman directly

  im happly to see youre amenable to
reason cosmo i sure am he rubbed
his nose yes sir i like a reasonable
man im going to be able to use you
cosmo

   thats what you said last night cosmo
reminded him his face blank the palms
of his hands were sweating he wanted
to run as fast and far from the sly red
faced man as he could bemmelman he
was beginning to sense was as slippery
and dangerous as the infamous venusian
swamp rath

   a door at the rear of the chamber opened
suddenly cosmo jumped a glance as-
sured him it was only a slave girl she
wasnt a venusian though he frowned
she was from earth

   the terran girl regarded the prisoners
curiously then faced bemmelman rabaul
aid you wanted me she was dressed
in a green sarong which reached from
her knees to her breasts on her left


planet stories

shoulder was a small scar in the shape of a
fern leaf bemmelmans brand

  yes sir said the planter so i do
so i do liana be so good as to escort
miss maclver to the tower apartment
dont leave her

  mia shuddered clung tighter to cosmo
keep your head mia he gently dis-
engaged her hand if you dont go
theyll drag you off willy-nilly

  dispiritedly she followed the slave girl
from the guardroom she was so woe-
begone that cosmo felt a wrench at his
heart he faced the planter said in a
hard voice what did you want with me 
bemmelmans eyelids drooped he
turned on his heel said shortly come
along cosmo and started for the door
i want to have a talk with you yes sir
a very interesting talk

v

flanked by the two blue giants
cosmo followed his host down a long
corridor up a flight of steps and into a
sumptuously furnished apartment a yel-
low grass mat carpeted the floor from wall
to wall the furniture was covered with
a coarse woven fabric barbaric in its
color

  with a sigh bemmelman lowered him-
self into a lounge chair indicated another
for cosmo

  youre tired youve had an uncom-
fortable journey i wont keep you up
long he rang a bell

  with amazing promptness a wizened
mercurian scurried through a sliding wall
panel

  krudo juice said bemmelman cold
and sandwiches better bring a bottle of
food concentrates too

  the mercurian disappeared

  cosmo was staring at the bank of open
windows they gave onto a venusian
garden of grotesque beauty each plant
and shrub sparkling with a cold phosphores-
cence several insects the huge bird-like
insects of venus winged in from the
garden as they reached the window
there was a sudden sparkle of flame the
insects dropped dead to the floor

  an excellent warning bemmelman
said in a silky voice the force screens
you know yes sir not only do they dis-

courage guests from straying but they
keep intruders outside

  cosmo repressed a shiver ingenious
gadget

  gadget the red faced planter
threw back his head laughed uproariously
youre a droll rogue you are i like a
man with a sense of humor he rubbed
his nose then pointed to a picture above
the sofa recognize her dont you

  cosmo saw a three dimensional photo-
graph of a nude her skin was pale blue
flushed with healthy rose her hair like
molten gold

  sofi cosmo said with distaste the 
blue venus i should think bemmelman
youd have to wait rather long for your
profits

  so i do so i do but its possible
to harvest a yearly crop from a forest
trees grow even slower than people ill
show you the slave pens tomorrow ive
only the one blue venus though un-
fortunately the rest have been males

  cosmo wondered why the planter had
called attention to the blue venus he
suspected that bemmelman was subtly try-
ing to find out if he had learned anything
from sofi

  what do you do with the males he
asked prompted by something in bemmel-
maiis voice

  theyre interesting but theyve no mar-
ket value i have them destroyed

  cosmo bit his lip bemmelman was a
monster he wondered what the sealed
chambers held the chambers where his
spy penang-ihtok had never been able
to penetrate

  i suppose said the planter unexpect-
edly  youre curious about what i wanted
with you

  cosmo nodded

  well sir i could have had you killed
back in the caves of the cloud mountains
ive had a spy among your men for some
time he paused as the mercurian re-
turned deposited a tray between them it
held a silver pitcher of krudo juice thin
sandwiches a bottle of food concentrates

  go ahead said cosmo when the mer-
curian had departed he popped two of the
pills into his mouth

  where was i oh yes i could have
had you assassinated several times but
youve some information i want
the blue venvs	

  cosmos green eyes narrowed warily
what information

  the planter leaned forward tapped him
on the knee that bird the giant
ormoo oh yes i know how you escaped
from the roof last night yes sir and
very neat too he beamed amiably i
want to know where the ormoos feed
cosmo sat back in surprise

 why

  thats my secret said the beefy
planter yes sir thats my secret but
im a business man cosmo show me
where the ormoo feeds and ill make it
worth your while

  five thousand monad cosmo haz-
arded

  bemmelman didnt blink an eye five
thousand monad he agreed

cosmo sat back his face blank the
planter he realized had no more idea
of paying him five thousand monad than
he had of adopting him hed agreed to
the preposterous sum too readily cosmos
green eyes hardened

  and suppose i refuse

  but you wont you cant no sir
if you refused ill be forced to kill you
and trace the bird myself

  the devil you will cosmo could
feel sweat starting from his forehead
that birds savage as a tiger youve
already tried to trace it to its feeding
ground havent you thats why you
planted a spy among my men wasnt it
 yes sir bemmelman admitted with a
sigh i dont mind telling you he was
supposed to find out what and where the
bird ate but it damn near tore him to
pieces

  cosmo didnt say anything

  bemmelman leaned forward tapped his
knee again unfortunately the birds are
rare as the dodo ive spent quite a bit
of money trying to locate another the
only one thats been caught is in the solar
apiary on earth

  mention of the ormoo in the solar
apiary stirred cosmos memory he
stared at bemmelman with narrowed eyes
the ormoo in its wild state matured to
its full size in a few months the one
which the terran expedition had secured
hadnt reached adulthood until its nine-
teenth year the discrepancy had been

puzzling ornthologists ever since theories
had flooded the scientific journals but to
date no one had explained satisfactorily
why a wild ormoo should mature over
twenty times as fast as the same bird in
captivity

  well bemmelman rubbed his nose
his eyelids drooping

  if i show you where the ormoo feeds
what guarantee have i that youll carry out
your side of the bargain

  just my word said bemmelman with
a chuckle just my word

  two rouge-like spots sprang out on
cosmos cheek bones he came halfway
erect in his chair

  no violence please the planter held
up his hand look behind you

  cosmo turned his head the two jovian
primitives were crouched to spring he
sank back in his chair managed a tight
grin his lips felt dry his stomach hollow

  i dont think you appreciate your posi-
tion cosmo said the planter silkily
no sir i dont he heaved himself
from his chair with a grunt ive some-
thing to show you come with me

  the two jovian dawn men fell in be-
side cosmo again as he trailed the planter
down three steps along a short corridor
to a sunken court bemmelman paused
pointed to a huge wooden cross in the
center of the court

  you werent depending on him were
you he smirked

  cosmo felt his blood run cold his
fists clenched until the nails bit into the
flesh

  the body of penang-ihtok hung from
the cross the outcast fozoql had been
crucified upside down

  you see said bemmelman his voice
heavy with assurance how futile it is
to oppose me

  cosmo turned away from the cross
with its grisly burden he looked coldly
speculatively at bemmelmans beefy smil-
ing face at the look fright glimmered in
the planters eyes he made a quick ges-
ture to the jovians who seized cosmo by
either arm

  take him away he ordered well
talk it over tomorrow

  cosmo was conducted into a plainly but
comfortably furnished room one of the
blue giants immediately stretched himself


planet

stories

on the sofa and went to sleep the other
though took a stance by the door folded
his arms regarded cosmo with the unwink-
ing stare of an idol obviously the jovian
primitives intended to spell each other

  with a grunt of annoyance cosmo re-
treated into the bathroom he had grossly
underestimated bemmelman he realized
with chagrin a malignant genius the
slave breeder had no more scruples than
his dawn men

  cosmo heard a soft step behind him
whirled around his jovian guard was
standing placidly just within tbe door

  damn he snapped nerves jangling
im not going to crawl out the drain

  the blue giant never changed expression
by so much as a flicker

  cosmo got a grip on himself shot the
giant his flashing grin whats the mat-
ter cat got your tongue

  he stripped off coat and trousers hung
them carefully over the jovians shoulder
stepped under the shower

  considerably refreshed he returned to
his sleeping chamber crawled raw into
the huge bed but sleep escaped him that
stark cross the body illuminated by the
radiations of the lichens and mosses per-
sisted in thrusting itself before his eyes
he clenched his fists trembled in an agony
of impotent fury somehow hed trip up
bemmelman smash his disgusting racket

cosmo awakened in the huge bed
sweating with terror the echo of
some nameless horror still rang in his ears
he saw the dawn man motionless as a
statue watching him with animal patience
then he heard it again

  it was a girls scream it reached him
faintly it went on and on he leaped
out of bed tugged on his trousers

  the dawn man sprang across the room
to intercept him cosmo seized a metal
chair swung it with the same movement
it caught the blue giant on his head and
shoulders the blow would have felled
an ox the jovian folded onto the carpet
lay still cosmo thought he must be dead

  the second jovian primitive jumped
from the sofa at the crash he had awak-
ened like an animal with a low snarl
he leaped for cosmo

  cosmo ducked under his first rush
crashed the chair down on the back of his

head the giant staggered groggily but
didnt go down

  cosmo measured the distance walloped
him again the second blue giant went
over like a falling tree

  without stopping for coat or shoes
cosmo hurtled into the hall the scream-
ing had been silenced the building was
quiet as a deserted church

  he set out at a lope in the direction of
the tower where mia was confined that
had been mia screaming he was sure
hed recognized the timbre of her voice

  his heart thudding he reached a stair
took the steps two at a time it bent
sharply to the left went up another flight
he must be in the tower itself the silence
was oppressive he wished fervently he
had a dart gun a ray projector anything
that would serve as a weapon the steps
continued to wind upward

  gasping for breath he reached the fifth
level from beneath a door seeped a
crack of light he sniffed a peculiar
odor impinged on his nostrils then he
heard bemmelmans rough voice like the
rasp of iron

  thats done take her to the slave
pens

  cosmos heart contracted a blinding
rage swept him hed been too late

  he rammed the door with his shoulder
it burst open as if exploded for a sec-
ond he was poised in the doorway big
rangy naked to the waist his hands hooked
like claws his nostrils distended

  without a word he leaped on bemmel-
man

  the planter was standing beside an op-
erating table upon which mia maclver
was strapped he fell back a step raised
his arm in a gesture of defense

  cosmos rush bowled him over back-
ward he tried to scramble to his feet
but cosmo was on him like a cat on a
mouse time after time he drove his fist
into the planters face a blinding rage
shook him to the marrow

  as if from a distance he heard mia
scream again

  cosmo look out behind you

  he swung off the insensible bemmel-
man twisted to his feet he saw liana
the terran slave girl directly behind him
her arm was upraised her fist clutching
a needle like dagger with a sob she
the blue venus	

plunged it downward toward his heaving
chest

  cosmo caught her wrist in a grip of iron
tore the dagger from her fingers con-
temptuously he tossed the girl into a cor-
ner of the room turned to mia

  mia are you all right

  she gave a sob of relief yes yes
but get me out of this iron lung before i
pass out

  he fumbled hastily at the clamps her
hair was tumbled one shoulder of her
tattered yellow tunic had been torn down
to her stomach he paused suddenly his
eyes dilating

there was an angry red scar above mias
left breast he realized what the smell
on the landing outside the tower room had
been it was the odor of burning flesh
mia maclver had been branded

vi

osmo said mia mia and gath-
ered her to him what have they
done to you

  liana scurried past like a frightened
rabbit

  shes getting away mia cried shell
irouse the house

  never mind cosmo could hear her
clatter down the stair weve got a
hostage he gave mia a wry grin
added that is if i havent killed bem-
melman

  mia shivered leaned against him he
glanced down saw she was regarding him
strangely with a dry sob she buried her
head on his shoulder

  cosmo cosmo dont ever leave me
again her voice was almost lost take
me with you-into the mountains

  he frowned said you crazy kid
you dont know what youre saying im
an outlaw theres no way to prove
bemmelman murdered my father and
mother and even if there was that
wouldnt clear me every crime the
security patrol hasnt been able to solve
has been laid at my doorstep

  we could run away we could go to
ganymede

  he shook his head it wouldnt make
any difference as long as the renegade
is alive theyll hunt theyd trail me
extradite me

  i dont care i dont care at least-

  the brazen clamor of the alarm bells
shrilled suddenly in their ears

  cosmo tore himself away knelt beside
the unconscious planter he drew a dart
gun from bemmelmans pocket said
hes alive

  what are we going to do cosmo 

  with a grunt he hoisted the slack body
over his shoulder the alarm bells were
pealing louder

  i saw a telo-antenna on the roof of the
tower when we were in the court ive
a hunch the telo-projector is somewhere
above us

  mia maclver clutching the tunic about
her shoulder asked but cant we run
for it

  not while the force screen is operat-
ing

  bent under his heavy burden cosmo
strode from the room up the steps to the
next level saying whats this he
pressed the button of a sliding panel
the door slid back in its oiled grooves
whew he said my ladys chamber

  lia maclver peered around him wide
eyed

  it was a large room octagon shaped
and carpeted wall to wall with the shaggy
gray fur of the polar aard but the most
startling feature was the mirrors the
walls were paneled solid in mirrors it
gave the impression that the room
stretched on forever

  well said mia if this is the telecast
operators room hes a voluptuous crea-
ture 

  cosmo snorted stepped across the
threshold at once replicas of themselves
flashed in all the mirrored chambers

  i feel wicked just being in a room
like this said mia

  cosmo heard a click behind him whirled
around the door through which theyd
just passed was shut in every direction
they were faced by an endless vista of
mirrored chambers

  mia gasped im scared she said

  who isnt said cosmo shortly and
dropped bemmelman to the floor with a
thud what are you staring at he
whipped around again

  a second door in the mirrors stood
ajar framed in the entrance was a mag-
nificently beautiful girl in skimpy shorts
	planet

and bra she was the twin of the photo-
graph below stairs

  well if it isnt my old friend sofi
said cosmo without enthusiasm

  there was no recognition in the blue
venus violet eyes her flawless pale-blue
features revealed neither shock nor sur-
prise

  thats bemmelman she indicated
the planter is he dead

  no only unconscious

  oh thats too bad she said in a
calm manner and swept up to the prostrate
slave breeder planted a kick in the seat
of his pants there ive never had
the nerve to do that when he was con-
scious

  mia gasped

  cosmo said sharply j wheres the tele-
cast room

  the next floor but you cant escape
nobody ever escapes from this house

bemmelman stirred opened his
eyes sat up groggily his face was
puffy swollen blood had dried on his
chin he didnt say anything

  the clatter of many feet resounded on
the stair outside the boudoir mia clutched
cosmos arm said theyre coming
cosmo took the dart gun from his pocket
narrowed his green eyes you go first
bemmelman if they rush us under-
stand 

  the slave breeder glared at cosmo
moistened his battered lips what do
you want me to do he spoke with
difficulty

  clear the tower order everyone into
the rest of the house

  bemmelman nodded sullenly

  cosmo saw one of the mirrors shiver
violently then the panel slid back the
stair was jammed with naked blue jovians
and venusian serfs the slave girl
liana was in the forefront she pointed
at cosmo screamed there they are
the jovians started to surge through
the narrow door

  cosmo drew a bead on bemmelmans
thick neck smiled grimly

  blood drained out of the planters face
get out he cried in panic

  the rescuers halted stared stupidly
the ones in the rear continued to push
forward causing momentary confusion

stories

  get out bemmelman raged get
out you fools dyou want to get me
killed clear the tower

  they began to withdraw sullenly
cosmo stepped after them slid shut
the panel he could hear their footsteps
retreating down the stair he let his
breath escape through his teeth

  keep your eye on the blue venus
mia shes a shifty wench

  mia siezed a candlestick from a dainty
martian table said this isnt going to
hurt me half as bad as it will you to
sofi

  cosmo dug the dart gun into bemmel-
mans kidneys lets go up to the tele-
cast room he pushed the planter ahead
of him through the door

  the stair well was deserted silent

  i smell roses said mia

  cosmo thought he detected a glint of
triumph in the slave breeders eyes up
the steps he said grimly at the first
sign of treachery bemmelman im pulling
the trigger

  they reached the telecast room without
opposition it was a small square cham-
ber banked with control panels an
opaque screen was built into the left wall
there was only one chair

  cosmo closed the door motioned mia
and the blue venus to one side now
bemmelman call your head overseer
have him shut down the force screens
the red-faced planter laughed shortly
said no sir he had regained his
composure no sir you wont kill me
youd be throwing away your only chance
to stay alive the force screen stays up
thats what i thought youd say
cosmo slipped the dart gun in his pocket
his eyes became hard green stones
what about the ormoos feeding ground 
why do you want to know where they
eat

  thats my secret a sullent note crept
into bemmelmans manner

you dont want me to mess you up
do you bemmelman  cosmo asked softly
the planter flinched but didnt answer
cosmo knocked him sprawling against
the wall he heard mia gasp he said
evenly what about the ormoo
bemmelman tasted the blood in his
mouth said youll never leave here
alive cosmo you wont be able to carry
the blue venus



tales    now wait a moment theres
a plant the birds eat that contains a drug
   he paused

  cosmos eyes narrowed he had the
impression that the planter was listening
waiting for something to happen he
said go ahead

  the drug accelerates maturity it acts
directly through the glands

  how did you hit on the discovery
a feeling of revulsion made cosmos hands
tremble but his features were inscrutable

  bemmelman chuckled amiably this
information wont do you a bit of good
he said no sir not a bit

  go ahead

  bemmelman shrugged well sir ive
been curious about how much longer it
takes for an ormoo in captivity to mature
than the wild bird the wild ormoo
you know reaches its full growth in less
than a year thats an amazing phenom-
enon when you consider its size yes sir
   he paused again mouth open then
hastily went on yes sir i wondered if
it wasnt the wild birds diet i sent a
man into the cloud mountains to locate an
ormoo he found your birds nest
cosmos green eyes were opaque re-
vulsion for the slave breeder welled in
his throat

bemmelmans manner was derisive
he rubbed his nose said one day
my man found a shrub in the nest he
sent it to me on the chance that it might
be what i was looking for it was the
leaves contain a drug which when in-
jected into the bloodstream accelerates
maturity at an unbelievable rate his lids
drew down i injected it into one of the
slave children in minute doses every
twenty days the child reached ado-
lescence in eighteen months in two
years time she was full grown

  you can breed slaves like guinea pigs
now eh bemmelman cosmos voice was
low and in two years time have them
ready for the market

  bemmelman said certainly and
paused

  what are you listening for cosmo
asked suddenly

  nothing nothing at all his little
eyes darted about the room unfor-
tunately he went on hurriedly i used

up all the drug on the experiment and
i havent been able to locate any more
of the plants no sir weve scoured the
cloud mountains theyre difficult to
explore infra red rays help some but
not much

whos the spy you planted among my
men cosmo interrupted in a cold voice
bemmelman shut his mouth with a snap
who is he tell me bemmelman or
by heavens ill work you over until your
own mother couldnt recognize you

  still the planter didnt reply

  cosmo hit him in the mouth the plant-
ers head struck the wall he slid down
to the floor said groggily it doesnt
matter no sir i wont need him any
more hes a martian his names
natal

  cosmo wasnt surprised theyd found
the martian wandering apparently lost in
the mountains a sly fellow always curi-
ous always prying

  cosmo turned to the telecast he felt
mias horrified eyes on him the child-
like stare of the blue venus he
switched on the telecast signaled his
headquarters in the cloud mountains at
the third attempt he got through

  to his surprise the inscrutable mien of
the mercurian runaway flashed on the
visoscreen his amber eyes twinkled a
smile split his buddha-like face and he
bowed three times until cosmo could only
see the top of his head

  i see you got through all right said
cosmo dryly a faint hiss seemed to be
coming through the audio he tried to
tune it out but the hiss persisted

  yes said the mercurian delightful
fellows but blood-thirsty you should
hear the tales theyve been telling he
shuddered

  ive heard them cosmo interrupted
often wheres big unse

  playing truk with the men im on
duty at the telecast

  cosmo frowned the hissing noise was
louder he said i havent time for you
to call him im at the bemmelman planta-
tion im holding bemmelman himself as
a hostage tell big unse to bring the
ormoo you follow in the surface plane
with the men dont land hang in the
clouds above the plantation until i whistle
for the ormoo oh yes be sure that
	planet

natal the martian comes along got it
  yes

  cosmo flipped off the telecast frowned
the hissing had not stopped there was
the faintest smell of roses in the air he
felt suddenly dizzy mia gave a small cry
and crumpled to the floor

  paralysis gas he thought and wheeled
toward bemmelman almost lost his bal-
ance as he did so

  the planters head had dropped on his
chest he raised it groggily leered with
triumph at cosmo concealed tubes
he muttered every room

  cosmo swayed he fumbled at his
pocket his hand emerged with the dart
gun he strained to elevate the gun
send a poisoned needle into the slave
breeder his muscles refused to obey him
the gun sagged his knees sagged
then slowly he toppled sideways

vii

cosmo opened his eyes in the office
with the glassite desk he sat up
chains rattled he realized with chagrin
that he was manacled hand and foot

  bemmelman was on the sofa a serf
directed by the slave girl liana was work-
ing over him mia and the blue venus
were stretched out on the floor beside him
still unconscious both of them were
manacled two blue giants watched in-
curiously

  in a moment bemmelman stirred he
sat up swung his feet to the floor his
eyes lit on cosmo with a grunt he
crossed the room kicked the manacled
man in the ribs

  cosmos face hardened but he didnt
say anything

  the planter swung on his servitors
barked get out  they left the room
all except liana he turned back to
cosmo said im through playing around
with you yes sir wheres the ormoos
feeding ground

  cosmo said nothing

  bemmelmans face went purple he
kicked cosmo viciously in the ribs
wheres the feeding ground where is
it where is it

  mia regained consciousness sat up
she stared wide-eyed at the berserk
planter

stories

  bemmelman glanced at her paused
he rubbed his nose a fiendish light shin-
ing in his pig-like eyes he said in a
sudden altered tone im still willing
to bargain cosmo

  what do you mean 

  either you reveal the location of the
feeding grounds or i hand miss maclver
over to the dawn men yes sir im
anxious to repeat that experiment he
pointed to the blue venus who was just
coming out from under the effects of the
gas

  cosmos features were inscrutable he
asked what happens to miss maclver
if i give you that information

  ill release her in venusport with her
fare back to earth im holding personal
notes on the maclver plantation anyway
notes echoed mia blankly father
never mentioned any notes i-i dont be-
lieve it

  a veil dropped before bemmelmans
eyes i havent told you before i didnt
like to so soon after your fathers death
but i lent him considerable money yes
sir considerable

  cosmo laughed without humor up
to your old tricks eh bemmelman
what dyou mean  the red-faced
planter looked faintly rattled he took a
threatening step

  you kick me again said cosmo and
ill kill you if i have to bite you to death
mia giggled nervously

  well said bemmelman thats my
proposition take it or leave it

  what about me asked cosmo
youre worth fifty thousand monad on
the hoof cosmo yes sir im going to
turn you and your men over to the secur-
ity patrol

  suppose i talk

  talk bemmelman threw back his
head and roared talk dyou say
wholl believe anything the renegade
says 

  a nice point cosmo conceded dryly
but what about mia

  miss maclver what can she tell
arent you forgetting cosmo that i
rescued her from you yes sir whats
more ive captured you and im turning
you over to the officials his eyes
twinkled whos she going to tell any-
way
the blue venus



  cosmos lean visage was unreadable
so that he thought was the line bem-
melman planned to take only mia mac-
lver would never be released he wondered
if the planter really considered him such
a fool he said you dont give me
much choice and twisted to his feet
he hobbled to the desk dropped awk-
wardly into the chair give me pen and
paper

  bemmelman produced writing material
spread them before him

  heres the cloud mountains hin-
dered by the manacles cosmo sketched a
chain of hills indicated north with a crude
compass he placed a dot halfway into
the mountains then laid off a line from the
dot running diagonally into the most rugged
sector he shoved the paper across to
bemmelman the first dots the ormoos
nest you know where it is

  bemmelman nodded wrote ormoos
nest on the map

  cosmo closed his eyes sighed faintly
the mountains are impassable except by
plane and then its all blind flying rise
to an altitude of four thousand meters
youll clear any peaks that way start-
ing at the ormoos nest fly due north
northwest for a distance of ninety-three
kilometers he paused

only the scrape of bemmelmans pen
could be heard as the planter wrote
the directions on the bottom of the map

  drop straight into the valley cosmo
went on as the pen scratching ceased its
narrow a canyon the floor of the valley
is at an altitude of one thousand seven
hundred meters so youll be in clouds all
the time its tricky navigating

  bemmelman stopped writing waved the
paper dry then he folded it put it away
in the wall safe behind the sliding panel
this had better be right he said omi-
nously

  cosmo opening his eyes said its
right ive been there a dozen times the
first time the bird carried me there acci-
dentally before he was well trained

  good bemmelman glanced at his
watch now cosmo well lay a trap for
those men of yours yes sir they should
be along any minute how many have
you 

  nine again cosmo emitted a faint

sigh what do you want me to do  he
realized that mia and liana both were
staring at him with distaste only the
blue venus seemed untouched

  you cant betray your men mia
burst out

  cosmos face hardened he said can
you suggest a better way

  youre a sensible man cosmo a sensible
man the planter rubbed his hands to-
gether triumphantly he snapped on the
intercommunicating telecast on the glassite
desk said into it rabaul

  right came the voice from the audio
that was good work with the gas
tubes rabaul

  you can thank liana came the voice
of the overseer from the audio cosmo
recognized the sibilant accent of a martian
she gave the alarm

 bemmelman grunted take twenty
jovians he said and a dozen serfs arm
the serfs with ray rifles hide them about
the roof the renegades men will try
to land shortly and id like to prepare wel-
come for em

  right came rabauls voice

  the planter switched off the telecast
he looked at cosmo smiled said whistle
em down cosmo thats all my jovians
will take care of the rest

  its daylight said the blue venus
with an air of childish surprise she was
looking out the windows

  cosmo was aware of the heat all at
once it curled about him like a steaming
towel he looked at mia there were
circles under her eyes her hair was
tangled her tunic in threads poor kid
he said

  bemmelman glanced at his watch your
men should be up in the clouds now
waiting  eh cosmo 

  cosmo said theyll be up there
well give them another hour said
bemmelman to be on the safe side he
rang for a servant ordered breakfast
served in the office

  they picked at their food listlessly when
it arrived bemmelman kept glancing at
his watch at length he stood up turned
to the slave girl call the security patrol
liana

  cosmo frowned but said nothing
what should i tell them asked liana
snapping on the telecast
	planet

  get hold of the commissioner tell
him weve caught the renegade he
chuckled amiably that should make
him sit up yes sir tell him to get
right out here though because the rene-
gades men are trying to rescue him

  a girls features horsefaced blonde
formed on the screen venusport se-
curity patrol she said

  the commissioner said liana this
is the bemmelman plantation calling

  the screen blanked out as the horsefaced
girl switched to the commissioners office
in a moment the fat face and shoulders of
the commissioner blotted out half the
screen his eyes were puffy his jowls
sagged he looked as if he were suffer-
ing from a hangover

  well he asked

  weve captured the renegade

  what his eyes snapped open

  weve got the renegade here at the
plantation but hurry his men are try-
ing to rescue him please hurry

  im on my way

  the commissioner leaped out of vision
forgetting to shut off the telecast they
could hear his bull-like voice roaring or-
ders liana snapped off the machine
turned indifferently to the windows

  bemmelman chuckled said keep your
eyes on miss maclver liana dont let
soft go galavanting around either he
took the chains off cosmos ankles but
left his hands manacled next he went
to his desk took out a dart gun he said
come along to cosmo and led the way
into the corridor

they didnt go through the trap this
time but up in the tower where a
door gave directly onto the flat roof
cosmo saw that the chamber just inside
the door was jammed with naked blue
giants and venusian serfs

  a tall black eyed martian foppishly
dressed in spite of the heat came to meet
them he wrinkled his nose at the stale
odor of sweat already thick in the room
picked his way through the men

  i didnt deploy them on the roof he
said in the sibilant accent of the red
planet because theres no cover theyd
be spotted at once they can rush the
renegades men through the door he
examined cosmo curiously

stories

  bemmelman rubbed his hands together
said thats right rabaul yes sir im
glad you thought of that he glanced
through the door at the low swirling cloud
mass then turned back to cosmo get
out on the roof whistle em down no
tricks now

  cosmo stepped through the door into
the hot dim daylight he glanced aloft
put two fingers in his mouth whistled
loudly he had trouble managing the
cuffs but he blew again and again

  his eyes swept the heavens but no sign
of bird or plane appeared through the veil-
ing clouds

  whats wrong called bemmelman in
a low nervous voice

  cosmo shook his head he put his fin-
gers back in his mouth whistled until he
was red in the face he might as well have
whistled for a wind

  bemmelman stamped out of the tower
he scoured the low roof of clouds an
ominous glitter in his pig-like eyes

  where are they

  you know as much about it as i do
cosmo shrugged theyre not there or
theyd come down

  if youre tricking me   

  how the hell would i be tricking you
cosmo asked irritably you heard me
give my orders over the telecast theyre
not there thats all and im damn glad
theyre not

  the planter continued to stare at him
suspiciously cosmo could feel his plan
hanging precariously in the balance then
bemmelman said it doesnt matter i
suppose they can be rounded up later
the security patrol will be here any mo-
ment he shoved cosmo ahead of him
into the tower

  cosmo let his breath escape evenly he
could feel little beads of sweat on his
forehead

  the red faced planter slipped the dart
gun out of his pocket rabaul he or-
dered grumpily get the men back to their
quarters

  the martian elevated his eyebrows but
bemmelman vouchsafed no explanation
the planter watched his overseer herd the
men down the stair then turned to cosmo
as the last of the jovians were disappearing
the dart gun dangled in his fist at his
side his eyes were mean
the blue venus	

  get a move on he said sharply

  all right said cosmo he was right
beside the planter

  in that instant bemmelman sensed dan-
ger his eyes widened he tried to whip
up the dart gun then cosmos manacles
smashed the planter along side the head

  it was a terrible blow the red faced
slave breeder caved to the floor as if his
bones had turned to jelly for a moment
cosmo thought hed killed him he
stooped found bemelmans pulse it was
weak but steady grim lipped he leaped
back to the roof

  cursing his manacles cosmo fumbled
a whistle from his pocket he wet his
lips blew as the time hed summoned
the ormoo to carry off mia the high
shrill note was inaudible to human ears

  bemmelman cosmo thought grimly had
been a bit too clever the planter had
heard him say whistle over the tele-
cast it hadnt occurred to him that the
ormoo might be trained only to notes in the
higher register

  he glanced aloft the cloud blanket
began to boil suddenly then the ormoo
plummeted soundlessly to the roof big
unse the blue star of the forzoql caste
tattooed on his yellow forehead his face
split by a grin leaped silently from its back

  the bird stretched out its beak rubbed
it against cosmos leg

  quick said big unse on to the
bird well be spotted in a minute

  cosmo shook his head watching a sur-
face plane nose cautiously down from the
clouds theres a girl below stairs

  big unse scowled in disgust why
he asked practically do you have to have
that particular one

  the surface plane came to rest lightly
beside the ormoo the door was flung
open and eight men piled out weapons in
their hands there was no word spoken
five were swarthy venusian serfs there
was the yellow eyed mercurian bland
smiling unarmed there was natal the
traitorous martian and the blue jovian

  were going to get a girl said big
unse

  cosmo slapped the ormoo on the side
jt launched itself silently into the air
the plane wont be noticed he said
but that bird would catch the eye of a

-planet stories-spring

dead man he nodded toward the tower
like wolves they followed him silently
inside

  the manacles cosmos voice was
low as he held out his arms bemmelman
has the key

  big unse dropped beside the uncon-
scious planter he dug out the key un-
locked cosmos wrists

  put them on bemmelman said cosmo
as soon as the planter was securely cuffed
he said pick him up bring him along

they crept down the stairs fanned
out like hunting dogs without ap-
pearing to do so cosmo kept natal the
spy under observation they reached the
corridor started for the office a serf
came out of a bisecting passage he saw
them drew back tried to yell two of
the venusians were on him like tigers
they clamped a hand over his mouth
held him so that he couldnt wriggle
cosmo said bring him along too

  big unse put his face down close to the
serfs said dont cry out or by the star
on my forehead ill skin you alive

  the serfs eyes rolled he nodded
vigorously trying to convey his absolute
willingness to cooperate

  there was a faint amused gleam in
cosmos eyes he paused before the
office then slid the panel back

  mia and the blue venus still manacled
stumbled to their feet liana the slave
woman jerked around from the windows
her jaw dropping then she bit her lip
glanced at the button on the glassite desk

  stay away from the desk liana
cosmo admonished her he stood aside
allowed his men to file into the office they
deposited bemmelman on the sofa cosmo
saw that natal was safely inside shut the
door at his nod big unse unlocked both
the girls

  mia said but    but   then a
look of fright wiped away the relief on
her wide gray eyes the security patrol
cosmo theyll be here any moment please
cosmo dont let them catch you

  the buzzer on the telecast began to
sound

  its too late cosmo smiled grimly
ive a hunch thats the security patrol
now he turned to the terran slave
girl said liana string along with me
	plan et stories

and ill promise that both you and your
daughter are provided with passage to
earth

  the telecast continued to buzz impa-
tiently

  my daughter the slave girl clapped
her hand to her mouth you know
ive suspected he corrected her
theres a resemblance so sofi really is
your daughter

  mia looked from the blue venus to
liana in bewilderment there didnt
seem to be over five years difference in
their ages its    its impossible she
blurted out

  the blue venus smiled enigmatically
cosmo said i thought liana that
sofi was the hold bemmelman had over
you

  at mention of the planters name liana
stiffened hell kill sofi if i betray him
cosmo shook his head

  you havent any evidence against him
she insisted even if you had they
wouldnt believe the renegade

  exactly said cosmo answer the
telecast liana

  her face set she went to the audio
switched it on

  the security patrol is here came
rabauls voice what shall i do with
them 

  liana glanced dead faced at cosmo who
said in an undertone tell him to send
the commissioner here have his men
served with refreshments

  she repeated the orders tonelessly into
the telecast

  right said rabaul the instrument
went dead

  cosmo went behind the glassite desk
sat down he leveled his dart gun straight
at natal the martian

  natal he said in a cold manner
bemmelman sold you down the river
he told me you were his spy

the martian blanched but his black
eyes were hard as marbles i should
have guessed the pig would betray me
get his gun big unse said cosmo
the fazoql catfooted behind the mar-
tian relieved him of his weapon

  follow my lead said cosmo to natal
concealing the dart gun up his sleeve
because so help me if you dont youre
a dead martian

  natal nodded stiff faced but willing

  bemmelman groaned sat up he re-
garded the scene in disbelief then his
little pig eyes narrowed he didnt say
anything and cosmo ignored him

  there was a knock on the door

  thats the commissioner said cosmo
let him in big unse

  mia looked wretched frightened no
she said and bit her lip to stifle the rest
of the protest

  big unse slid back the panel

  the fat commissioner waddled inside he
was even fatter than he appeared over
the visoscreen he bulged in his clothes
like a sausage

  well hal he began in a hearty voice
you lucky dog the fifty thou    the
words stuck in his throat he stared at the
hard faced green eyed man behind the
desk at bemmelman in irons he re-
volved slowly taking in the silent men
about the walls the three girls wh-
whats this he sputtered but there
was a sick frightened look in his eyes
wheres the renegade

  there he is commissoner replied
cosmo dryly all done up in irons he
pointed at bemmelman lying manacled on
the sofa

viii

bemmelman was the first to re-
cover his voice his neck swelled
he laughed hoarsely nobodys fool
enough to believe im the renegade
cosmo

  youre crazy young man the com-
missioner burst out as he caught his breath
if this is a joke its in remarkably poor
taste

  its no joke cosmos eyes hardened

  you lying rogue bemmelman shouted
this has gone far enough theres your
renegade commissioner

  keep him quiet big unse said cosmo
softly until i finish he can talk his
head off then

  big unse doubled his fist shook it in
bemmelmans face the planter subsided
but a cunning gleam winked in his little
brown eyes

  the commissioner drew a handkerchief
from his pocket dabbed at his forehead
he sank into a chair with a groan talk
the blue venus	

fast young man he said and it had
better be good he eyed cosmo with
obvious distrust

  cosmo took a moisture-proof cigarette
case from his pocket snapped it open i
realize commissioner this must be quite
a shock bemmelmans been powerful in
politics he has allies in high places but
when they learn hes the renegade theyll
be the first to disown him he took a
cigarette out of the case eyed it critically
put it back even rats he added glanc-
ing up at the commissioner have sense
enough to leave a sinking ship

 um said the commissioner he
looked discomfited shot a sly glance at the
manacled planter

  bemmelman started to roar a protest
but big unse grinned shook his hammer
like fist in his face

  id better sketch in his background
said cosmo judicially he was an or-
ganic chemist on earth but got involved
in a forgery case he next showed up
smuggling jovian primitives to venus
the tis got on his trail but they were
never able to pin anything on him
how do you know all this the com-
misioner asked

  you dont need to take my word its
all in the records you can investigate
them yourself

  um said the commissioner again and
dabbed at his forehead he purposefully
avoided bemmelmans eye

  cosmo glanced at mia who was regard-
ing him in sheer amazement he smiled at
her said bemmelman figured itd be safer
to breed slaves here on venus rather than
run the risk of capture by the empires
patrol spacers but he found that land
on venus cant be bought except in rare
cases he paused looked at the apoplec-
tic slave breeder

  bemmelman murdered my father hav-
ing first provided himself with forged notes
to the plantation youll remember he was
mixed up with a forgery case on earth
why-whiy the commissioner sput-
tered indignantly thats- preposterous
here are the notes cosmo pulled
two packets of papers from his pocket
tossed theip to the commissioners lap
youll find notes for old maclvers
plantation there too bemmelman had
decided to grab it off too

  the fat commissioner examined them
curiously

  theyre good said cosmo but it
wont be too hard to prove theyre for-
geries

  the commissioner rustled the papers
but whats all this to do with the rene-
gade i came out here to collar him
not rattle old bones

  cosmo pointed his right hand lazily at
natal the martian spy it was the arm
with the dart gun up its sleeve natal
blanched

  ask him said cosmo blandly hes
one of the renegades men

everyone stared at the martian
well thundered the commissioner
natal wanted to quit bemmelman
had tried to sell him out cosmo subtly
reminded the martian of the planters
treachery he came to me

 why to you the commissioner
wanted to know 

  he knew i was trying to prove bem-
melman murdered my father and mother
and stole my plantation cosmo shrugged
added in a pointed tone i told him that
if he would-ah-share his information
with you commissioner that the two of
you could split the fifty thousand monad
reward id be satisfied with regaining
my plantation

  the fat commissioners eyes shone with
cupidity he and the astounded martian
exchanged glances

  bemmelman who hadnt missed this
by-play roared and half flung himself from
tbe sofa

  hes trying to frame me

the commissioner regarded bemmel-
man with a frown then he turned
away asked in a changed voice will
natal go on the witness stand

  go ahead natal said cosmo

  natal ran the tip of his tongue over
his thin lips he gave bemmelman a
venomous glance said hes the rene-
gade all right we holed up in the cloud
mountains bemmelman gave us our
orders for the most part over a special
frequency radio phone he never let any-
one here on the plantation guess he was the
renegade he played a dual role

  a jekyll and hyde role interposed
cosmo smoothly
	planet

  lies lies shouted bemmelman
the commissioner ignored him kept
his eyes on natal you can show us the
hideout 

  certainly

  what about the other men

  they escaped cosmo interposed
quickly

  um said the commissioner he
didnt appear anxious to pursue that line

  natals not the only witness said
cosmo he pointed at mia the rene-
gade kidnapped miss maclver she tried
to reach jou by telecast

  she did the commissioner en-
thusiastically smacked his right fist in his
left palm by heaven she did but
when my men got there hed gotten away
with her

  i dont think shell object to taking
the witness stand either said cosmo in
a thoughtful voice after all bemmel-
man murdered her father

  no mias voice was so low that the
commissioner had to bend forward to
hear her no i wont mind being a
witness bemmelman kidnapped me

  i didnt kidnap her i rescued her
from the renegade the sweat was pour-
ing from the planters forehead

  the girls head jerked up she said in
a ringing voice then how do you explain
this  and exposed the brand on her
shoulder

  the commissioners eyes started from
their sockets

  you might call the head overseer and
check on bemmelmans movements sug-
gested cosmo

  the commissioner nodded

  liana switched on the telecast rabaul
she said the commissioner wants you in
the office

right came the voice of the martian
theres the safe too said cosmo
the commissioner heaved himself from
his chair waddled across to bemmelman
whats the combination hal

  the planters little eyes were bloodshot
obscenity burst from his mouth

  a laugh rumbled up from the commis-
sioners belly shook all three of his chins
youre done for hal whats the com-
bination 

  grudgingly bemmelman told him but
you wont find anything there he added

stories

vindictively im going to sink you

  cosmo opened the safe waved the com-
missioner forward to investigate

  um said the commissioner in disap-
pointment leafing through the papers
maybe we can dig something incriminat-
ing out of this mess i dont know hey
whats this  he held up the paper upon
which bemmelman had written the direc-
tions for reaching the ormoos feeding
ground looks like a map

  it is a map replied cosmo grimly
i wouldnt be surprised if it isnt the lo-
cation of the loot from the plantations bem-
melmens men have raided

  there was a knock on the door

  come in snapped the excited com-
missioner

  the martian overseer stalked into the
office glanced about him in surprise

  tell these fools im not the renegade
bemmelman roared

  rabaul regarded his employer blankly
youre certainly not the renegade so
far as i know

  of course not interrupted the com-
missioner we dont expect you to be
able to identify him we only want to
ask you a few questions

  the martian pursed his lips shrugged
anything i know commissioner

 where was bemmelman yesterday
morning 

  i dont know the martian overseer
looked surprised he left in his surface
plane in the directon of the maclver
plantation

  alone

  rabaul nodded

  um has he ever received messages
from the cloud mountains  radio calls 
yes admitted rabaul grudgingly
though i cant tell you what theyre
about ive instructions to call him imme-
diately the call signals come through i-ie
takes them personally

  have you ever known him to make
trips into the mountains

  again the martian nodded yes hes
made expeditions into them after botanical
specimens i believe

  we got him said the commissioner
and cosmo could see him counting his half
of the reward that map is the most
damning evidence of all its in his hand-
writing isnt it
the blue venus	

   you can have it checked said cosmo

 -	complacently but theres one thing
 more

   eh

   motive

 cosmos face hardened slaves
 arent cattle after bemmelman
 started his slave farm he couldnt expect
 profits for eighteen years he needed
 money lots of money to -carry on certain
 experiments he was an organic chemist
 he believed it possible to force humans
 the same way a gardner forces plants an
 aging process isnt a new idea but it took
 bemmelman to find a commercial use for
 it

   it fits like a glove said the commis-
 sioner but how do you know about the
 experiment 

   i can tell you about the experiments
 interposed liana suddenly

   everyone stared at her

   she bit her lip im a terran he-
 he kidnapped me mated me with a dawn
 man as an experiment sofi is my
 daughter

   not a bad experiment said the com-
 missioner admiringly his eyes ran over
 the blue venus

   that was only the beginning said
 liana i found out hes got a laboratory be-
 low stairs where hes constantly experi-
 menting with the slave children hes
 obsessed with the scheme of maturing the
 children quicker so that he can reap faster
 profits bemmelman is a monster

   go on said the commissioner eagerly
   he-he succeeded at last

   what do you mean

   liana pointed at the blue venus soft
 she said in a low voice sofi is only seven
 years old

   absolute silence gripped the room
 youll swear to that asked the com-
 missioner at length

   of course half the serfs in the house
 know her age anyway

   weve got him cried the commissioner
 jubilantly weve got him dead to rights
 its a frame up shouted bemmelman
 in despair a dirty frame up i tell you
 cosmo regarded the planter with opaque
 green eyes save your breath bemmel-
 man he counseled him dryly no ones

going to believe the renegade-remem-
ber

  from the flat roof of the manor house
cosmo and mia watched the security
patrol planes take off one by one for
venusport the head overseer was to take
charge of the plantation until the courts
confirmed cosmos claims liana and
sofi planned to visit earth after bemmel-
mans trial

  cosmo had taken big unse aside sent
him off secretly with the men to destroy
any evidence in their hideout they were
to return to the plantation i want the
lot of you under my eyes cosmo had
explained with a grin where you wont
be tempted to raid my plantation

  as the last of the patrol planes rose
from the roof cosmo turned to mia
thats finis for the renegade
bemmelman isnt the renegade really 
said mia half in doubt is he

  maybe not the renegade grinned
cosmo but hes certainly a renegade
mia gulped suddenly said the map
good heavens what will the commis-
sioner do when he doesnt find anything
but bird food

  bird food the devil cosmo said dryly
i havent the remotest idea where the
ormoos feed that map will lead him
straight to the spot where ive hidden
every stick of loot ive-ah-accumulated
he pulled the ormoos whistle from his
pocket

  mia eyed it in alarm what are you
going to do

  take you to venusport he blew
twice on the whistle were going before
the registrar today

  but cosmo not on that-that mon-
strosity i refuse to do it i wont go
there was a disturbance in the cloud
blanket directly overhead a huge gray
shape plunged venusward besides
she added in haste i cant go to venus-
port like this-can i

  well stop by your plantation spruce
up a bit

  the ormoo lit with a thud it gave a
pleased raucous squawk eyed them with
amiable red brown eyes

  oh well said mia between her teeth
i might as well get used to traveling on
the darn thing i suppose

 on speed and time

 broadway
lynn massachusetts

 dear editor 

   in regard to the disagreement of mr sherlock and mr sigler
 concerning the ultimate velocity i believe i may be able to add a
 few points

   to begin with there are two aspects of the problem that seem-
 ingly are in contradiction but which mesh upon admitting one of
 the principal aspects of einsteins theory

   the first fact is that speeds faster than light are impossible
 according to the theory of relativity deny this and you deny
 the theory considering the success of the recent atomic research
 based upon einsteins formulae and considering einsteins suc-
 cess in prognosticating an error in mercurys revolution about
 the sun one would be rash to deny the theory or the light-
 velocity limit

   the second fact is that according to all the laws of physics
 which have never been denied by einstein a given number of
 footpounds applied to a given mass over a given period of time
 will produce a calculable acceleration in the direction of applica-
 tion therefore an object with the power to accelerate at low
 speeds will likewise be able to accelerate at speeds nearing or
 equaling the speed of light

   how then to conciliate these apparently contradictory facts
 here the basic premises of relativity comes to the rescue is it
 possible for an object to be traveling at a speed of light or faster
 according to the space-time frame standard from which it started
vizigraph	

and yet seem to be traveling at a speed lower than
the speed of light by every possible physical
means of determining speed to the object it-
self the space-time variance resulting from the
variance in velocity will be just enough to make
the objects speed as measured by the mickelson-
morley method a naught also due to the space-
time frame differences an observer at any other
place or time would calculate a speed less than
that of light

  therefore if an object accelerated at one
thousand miles per second per day for a year at
the end of the year it would be going three hun-
dred sixty-five miles per second which on a graph
would be a straight line rising above the speed of
light but to an observer on let us say earth the
speed would approach the speed of light at a
slower and slower light if the first line ever
reached infinite speed the second would reach
the light speed meanwhile the objects own
measurable speed would remain at zero

   to illustrate this a little more if an object ac-
celerated at three times the pull of gravity for
four years decelerated for four years turned
around accelerated for another four years and
finally decelerated four years sixteen years
would have passed on earth but because of the
fact the objects average speed would be so much
greater than the speed of light that its time
scale would have been altered to such an extent
that only about four years and two months
would have passed for the object itself

   this by the way is of particular interest be-
cause it is the only way to time travel also
other than the hyperspace theories now emerg-
ing it is the only means of inter-stellar travel
even to our nearest neighbor in the practical span
of a lifetime

dear editor

  i would like to offer some more disagreeing
comment to mr sherlocks opinions on the ulti-
mate in the field of material velocity since i
missed the issue in which they first appeared i
do not know to what extent my own views will
disagree but in view of those that appeared in
the winter issue i feel that they will

  to put it into a few words my claim is that
the velocity of light is constant only in relation
to its source or point of reflection this was in-
dicated some time ago by an experiment per-
formed by prof michelson the experiment was
aimed at either proving or disproving the exist-
ence of a stationary ether and the results were
taken as an indication that there was no such
element it was reasoned that if the earth were
moving through a stationary ether an ether
stream would be set up parallel to the earths
motion and that a beam of light would take
longer to travel up this stream and back than it
would across and back in the experiment the
distance the beam of light was sent was the same
in each direction and so was the time required
now this is easily understood if we admit that
the speed of light is not constant in relation to
the ether when sent up the stream the speed
was reduced by the opposite motion of the
source this change being rectified by the motion

of the reflecting surface in the same direction as
that of the source the return reversed the
process

  it is my belief that momentum of material
bodies is caused by the same conditions of the
ether as those which produce light waves since
the ether permeates all space and matter the
atoms of a body traveling through it act as the
depressions of waves while the more dense ele-
ment between them act as the crests the only
difference in light waves is that the depressions
do not contain the complicated structure of
atoms it has been shown that light can travel
slightly faster or slower than the accepted speed
then why not matter the problem may lie only
in finding a driving force that will maintain ef-
fectiveness at such speeds

  the speed of light is constant in relation to
its source it is not constant in relation to the
ether mr sherlock is wrong mr sigler is
wrong they are both right or am i wrong

  now i would like to thank all parties respon-
sible for the great improvements in this mag in
the last two years this is my first planet
stories since i entered the army over two years
ago but it wont be my last

  i have one suggestion that is for the authors
to make their stories sound a little more logical
take passage to plant x for instance here we
had two gravities this would mean two differ-
ent sets of conditions the dense air of the
heavy side would constantly rush across the
twilight zone with great force sending the lighter
air up where it could be drawn back into the
heavy side it would be like a tired twister
lying down i dont think one could do much
fighting in that area even if the perlacs born
in and adapted to the heavy gravity and its par-
ticular conditions were as much at home on the
light side as the story indicates just the same
i enjoyed passage to plant xceptional as i did
the others i read for relaxation not for fault-
finding

sincerely

dear editor

  the cover probably due to the use of lighter
colors and a smoother appearance achieves a
somewhat more pleasing impression than usual
but its still far from ideal how about at least
trying a real stf cover-one with space ships
and a real space scene

  mcdowell improved tremendously in the
great green blight but why were murphys
pics ever accepted how long have you had
passage to planet x in your files tis said
that the hasse volume contains his last works
of stf so this must be even older the faultless
logic in venusian invader bolstered its position
considerably or perhaps my view is influenced
by the fact e e smith often used super-logic
in his excellent lensmen epics in the diversifal
rocklynne continues to murder his ideas-too
bad he cant handle them like van vogt frederic
brown or harry walton by the way somebody
surely misinformed kiemle the bem is not the
acme of stf art

  if you wish a lengthier review of your mag
look up my column concentrated opinion in
future issues of the fanzine panews

thanks for the note about sternigs scrap-
iron but how about reprinting it in planet
	planet

  so youre beginning to wonder what planet
will do when science catches up with it well
how about more of the intergalactic hyperspa-
cial sub-space and extra-dimensional type
stories science probably wont catch up on those
for a while and please dont leave out the imag-
inative theory sections of such stories ideas are
the life of stf

  as for letters george fox really deserves first
place give henry eisner jr number two spot
and evelyn vogt number three

  so you want takers for sherlock im no au-
thority but id like to raise one question is it
true or not that radio waves and light waves and
perhaps some other waves are just different fre-
quency manifestations of the same thing im
sure we realize that light waves are much shorter
than radio waves let us consider an analogy
sound waves and supersonic waves are both man-
ifestations of vibration but at different fre-
quencies we know that the normal sound waves
are longer than the supersonics but who will
venture to say that the sound waves travel faster
than the supersonics do you see my point
ed no but go right ahead i was thinking
of a different type wave

  as for siglers forecasts i would expect
quicker action than he does this age we are liv-
ing in is mighty fast and speeding up all the
time

  now back to foxs excellent letter he charges
you with giving us futuristic westerns  and such
in planet is your conscience bothering you
perhaps you feel planet should deal in the ad-
venturous type story but dont you think a spice
of scientifictional theory here and there would
make for improvement i believe the sherlock-
sigler controversy was started over sherlocks
complaint that stf contained stories wherein the
speed of light was exceeded and he didnt feel
that was scientific surely ways and means of
surpassing light speed has brought about some
of the greatest stf classics of all time for where
would stf be if we put a limit on our authors that
way practically saying you cant leave the
solar system science doesnt know everything
yet

  surely it would be much better to raise the
kick that stf is going unscientific on us in pre-
senting the neighboring planets as having satisfac-
tory atmospheres for our comfort and well-being
such is not the picture science has painted of our
neighbornig worlds let us first do away with the
camels weve been swallowing before we try
straining the gnats out of our stf diet

  now to foxs criticism of your art surely
youll have to admit some of your art is highly
unsatisfactory dont you think stf fans appre-
ciate good art however let us hope that with
the war cleaned up we can look for a real im-
provement

  i feel the visigraph would be considerably im-
proved if the editor or someone would at least
make some comment or reply to every letter in
a sensible and serious vein that is as for some-
thing to discuss how about each fan bringing
forth his opinions as to what makes an ideal stf
tale surely something interesting would come out
of that

  regarding his suggestion of additional depart-
ments i for one am in favor of it the fanzine
reprint department definitely has its problems
for i suppose you would be somewhat averse to
printing material which in any y advertised
your competitors but perhaps something worth-

stortes

while can be worked out i hope i have said
something of constructive nature

dear editor

  in the vizigraph section of the winter issue
of ps quite a few people complained that the
section was getting too-too-dull nataly look
who is writing in it

  im inclined to believe that the winter issue
of planet stories was rather good but-to copy
everyone else-oh  what a cover now mind
you i didnt say i didnt like it but it shames
me to carry it down the street other than that
i have only one complaint cant you get an ink
that will stay on the paper i read a few pages
--- look at my hands and they are
blood red or bright yellow depending on the
type of sky you are using that issue

  what do you say to starting an argument
whats there to argue about now days if you
are awake whats wrong with the following par-
agraph 

  nothing can go faster than a car lets sup-
pose that a car can go from here to there in a
certain length of time lets suppose this thing
which can supposedly go faster than a car can
go from here to there in five minutes less than
it takes the car if it takes the car four minutes
this thing gets there before it leaves for ex-
ample if the car left at  pm it would ar-
rive at  pm but the thing would get there
assuming at the same time in five minutes less
than  pm or at  one minute before it
left therefor nothing can go faster than a car
or anything for that matter

i know that sounds silly but ive heard it used
in telling why nothing could go faster than light

friction on the eyes

covington ky

dear editor

  the old corona four has been clamoring for
action from the moment my tired eyes discovered
that the battle cry being raised by mr sher-
lock for the emancipation of radium had this
movement been started earlier we might have
secured a seat for the duly elected representatives
of radium at the san francisco conference
perhaps there will be another conference at an-
other time and we can then correct for the
omission

  i missed mr siglers challenging letter as well
as mr shcrlocks published opinions on the ulti-
mate in the field of material velocities for all
practical purposes the lorentz-fitzgerald con-
traction hypothesis holds true but when we
extend this hypothesis into the field of abstract
reasoning we must also include the observations
made by coulomb during his experimental work
in determining the laws of friction the point at
which sliding friction becomes rolling friction
needs considerable enlargement before we can
fix an ultimate velocity for any particular ma-
terial

  since the friction between two surfaces is
slightly greater just before motion begins than
when the surfaces are in steady relative motion
an absolute measurement of the initial velocities
vizigraph	

becomes a physical impossibility furthermore
all of our sensitive measuring instruments are
inherently dependent upon some effect of fric-
tion so that contact potentials come into the
picture at the very instant when accuracy is of
the utmost importance

  in order to measure the velocity of light we
must first determine its relative mass and direc-
tion of travel an automobile driven across a
weighing instrument at sixty miles per hour ex-
erts considerably less pressure upon the scales
than when standing motionless since its applied
weight is not all in that direction for which the
scale is designed it has been relatively easy to
measure the elapsed time in which light will
travel between two measured points but we
have not yet arrived at its exact velocity sim-
ply because we do not know the exact course it
pursues

  in other words a wobbling wheel travels some-
thing more than a mile in carrying the automobile
a miles distance this is comparable to wave
motion so that the  kilometer per second
figure for light might conceivably be a measure
of the distance traversed by light during the time
it requires to reach a point  kilometers
away since wavelength seems to be related to
color how can you reconcile the facts with the
claim that their velocities are equal

  the atomic bomb has already revised the laws
of several scientific fields even though the rank
and file may not come to a realization of this
fact for several years would any thinking per-
son dismiss it from his mind as being nothing
more than the extension of some previously pub-
lished theory on the behavior of atoms in general 

  i would like very much to get in on the dis-
cussion but i am somewhat handicapped by not
having a copy of the first letters raising the
points of issue will someone kindly supply me
with this missing information 

  in the meantime i would suggest that both
mr sigler and mr sherlock give serious con-
sideration to the implied but cleverely disguised
straight-line theory of mr gardner f fox in
mannth do we know of anything which will
adhere to such an absolutely straight line of
travel that it cannot be deflected if so how will
we detect it and measure its force

dear sir

  i seldom feel the urge to try anything so un-
profitable as correcting other peoples bad taste
but i cant resist elbowing my way into the ar-
gument about kipling for myself i know of no
better science fiction stories than his two with
the night mail and as easy as a b c the other
magazine excerpts with the former are really
delicious and kiplings guess that dirigibles
would prove superior to airplanes was certainly
justified by the technical situation at that time

  kipling himself was one of the most mechani-
cally minded authors who ever lived as indicated
by such stories as the ship that found herself
he did not confine himself to india in his later
stories but created tales of all sorts-they in
the tone of henry james and the badalia herods-

foot story dealing with london slums in the tone
of arthur morrison for instance i question
certain of his social tendencies-the anti-grega-
riousness of as easy as a b c or the happy
fascist state in the army of a dream but few
men have ever had such an experimental mind
or such versatility and skill in phrasing he did
very creditably in all aspects from humor to ter-
ror while poor poes attempts at humor are
pretty revolting personally if i could ever
bring off symbolism like children of the zodiac
fantasy like on the gate or that perfectly mar-
vellous conversation between hal o the draft
and the country contractor in one of the stories
in rewards and fairies-two diverse men who
could understand each other through their com-
mon love of honest craftsmanship-id call my-
self a good writer mowgli with all his faults is
so far above tarzan as to be in a different world
in his autobiography kipling says he under-
stood that tarzans author was trying to see
how bad a story could be written and sold it
is harder to write a good fairy tale than prac-
tically anything else in the world-something
pleasing both children and adults i know for i
have tried without success i have quite a file of
science-fiction and i like it but id lose it all to
keep the elephant child

  i wont insist that everybody has to like kip-
ling but i think that even those who do not
should give him credit for his virtues inciden-
tally ill nominate macdonalds hymn as the
best poem of science-fiction so far produced
poes simple direct and precise language was
indeed excellent especially when compared with
the diffuse drivellings of the popular authors of
his day but he was an essentially limited man
great in certain fields yet with a machine made
touch continually in the background what a hor-
rible world this would be if everything we had
to read was as functional in design as good de-
tective stories only creative minds of the first
class dare to let their fancy run free with pleas-
ing results to the reader let us be thankful for
them on the rare occasions when they appear

  incidentally i like your magazine my favor-
ite type of story is the sort presenting a social
structure a bit different from ours giving me
points of reference to study our own-something
like gulliver i dont go for costume westerns
i am repelled by the hero who can answer all
the problems of a thousand years in two and a
half days of hard work i wish some of his an-
cestors were around now to help us with our
present difficulties that is what someone called
the personal devil theory of history you
know and while a bit of escapist writing is sooth-
ing at times it is likely to set us to looking for
the man on the white horse when our country

dear editor

   this is my first letter to a mag and i have a
few suggestions to make first why not put the
address to write to in the front part of vizigraph 
i may be just dumb but to me its kind of hard
to decide where to write so maybe some other
fans are in the same condition second could
you give us a few rocket ships on the cover once
in a while third your stories are good but the
novel is not long enough

  i enjoy your mag very much and have been
reading it for about a year the best stories of
the winter issue were

  	the great green blight-only one gripe
the blight that destroyed the plant men was red

  	mannth-this would have been better as
a novel

   	steel giants of chaos-a little confusing
but good

  	passage to planet x-fair

   	vcnusian invader-fair but one of those
trick stories

   the other two werent so hot

  heres something-theres a law of inertia
which states that if an object is pushed into mo-
tion it would move until the force of the air and
friction stopped it therefore if there was no air
to stop it and cause friction it would go on for-
ever the space outside the earths atmosphere
commonly called ether is a vacuum if a rocket
generated enough speed to leave the earths at-
mosphere  it would continue at the same speed
until it hit another planets atmosphere rockets
would not be needed on space trips except for
landings and take-offs not used in space they
could steer by rockets on top sides and bottom
if anybody wants to discuss this i will be glad
to oblige

if there are anv fans in florida write to me

sincerely

dear editor

   with this letter you can welcome a new visi-
fan to the ranks planet rates high with me in
the stf field

  now to the winter issue the best story in
my opinion is mannth mr fox is a find more
stories by this author please green blight comes
next followed by passage to panet x both were
swell stories although the plots were not new
the rest were good too except for ultimate
world which didnt appeal to me

   the illustrations for this issue were only so-so
 murphys for the novel were about the best
 although the pic by pious on page  had a
 weird atmosphere that i like hollingsworths on
 page  tied with doolins on  for worst place
 the cover well the less said about that the
 better

   whats next oh yes the visigraph best let-
ters were from guy trucano lionel innsman

stories

and chad oliver larry shaws little opus about
the bem was amusing too

  well well planet has a new editor con-
gratulations mr whitehorn lets hope that
with you at the helm she will rise to greater
heights

  ive heard an awful lot about the story vassals
of the master world if anyone has the issue
with this story in and wishes to sell it please get
in touch with me

  ho well guess ill buzz off now but ill be
back again soon

                     sincerely

dear editor

  strictly speaking this is not a letter of com-
ment on planet rather i would like to air a
few of my views on a currently running subject
in the visigraph

  when a weinstein stated that science-fiction
would never compare with such great literature
as shakespeares i am inclined to believe he was
mostly right surely no writer of the genre has
been so successful to date it is not impossible
but i think it will take the advent of a new
school of writers or a new trend in science-
pseudo or real-to bring forth such works the
type of story presently being written just doesnt
have that element of literary worth in it it is
entertaining naturally or you and i wouldnt
read it but literature never

  now we come to the letter of one lionel inn-
man firstly sir dont you think your own words
lend themselves rather well to another point of
veiw-greatness of an authors work is judged
by what the majority thinks and not by a mi-
nority like fandom well   

  but to criticize further-kipling you say
wrote mere indian local color and the jungle
book is tripe eh well  i wonder how your
opinion would be received by the saturday re-
view of literature-crank they might say or
perhaps literary moron   

  you ask us too to consider the works of
edgar allen poe did he not write stf he
did not-in any appreciable quantity and cer-
tainly not of a quality that befitted the super-
natural and fantasy stories upon which his fame
rests

  and then what about h g wells surely
even you do not seriously believe that h g
wells success was made by his scientific ro-
mances not for nothing did he write the outline
of history tuno-bungay mr britling sees it
through and the like of all his science-fiction
tales only the time machine comes close to
winning an all-around fame

  as for g k chesterton if his name must
be brought up and id really rather not at all
do so in relationship to the medium in which he
did dabble fantasy the same holds true for
merritt lovecraft and shakespeare

  this last seems to bring forth your main error
mr innman drifting away from the initial
statement where a weinstein was concerned
with science-fiction in its relation to fine litera-
ture you attempted to disprove him by refer-
ring to the works of fantasy not science-fiction
authors

  and that is in itself an entirely different
story for no one ever denied fantasyits high
place in literature many indeed are the authors
whose fame was achieved wholly through the
vizigraph	

medium of the fantasy story algernon black-
wood m r james m p shiel are but a few

   it is a shame indeed that science-fiction be
limited almost wholly to the pulp field for it
does show promise and as i said before the
necessary alterations in style and subject might
yet bring forth a truly great author or story

sincerely

point prover

dear editor 

  i was stirred from my lethargy by a number
of things in the winter issue of planet fore-
most  the list was the excellent fantasy of
rocklynnes the diver sial one of the best
tales to come out in any magazine at the present
time the plot was not exactly new but the
circumstances treatment and writing were par
excellence it was fascinating

   the rest of the stories i consider hack with
the exception of man-nth it was an interesting
idea but the way in which the story was exe-
cuted was rather amateurish too many loose
ends floating about ive noticed that about quite
a lot of the newer crop of stories since its got
to be blamed on something i suppose the war
is good enough

  then the viz lewis sherlock was interest-
ing and i vote him first i confess though
that i know little of the physical sciences i do
know enough to comprehend what sherlock is
talking about but as for discussing his hypothe-
sis im afraid its beyond me

  howard g allen will have to wait quite a
while before he sees masons viz supplement
about all mason can accomplish on that devils
machine of his is using an enormous amount of
energy and ink besides getting drunk on all the
beer he consumes furthermore he has a num-
ber of magazines to publish most of them
being published for the members of the gilded
gremlin press and very little time in which to
accomplish it

  maybe i owe mason an apology i also get
drunk on his beer

  i agree with papa innman on a lot of the
points he made however i still believe-and no
amount of argument can change my mind-that
for sheer educational and instructive value-and
im not talking through my hat-any of the
works termed classics beats any stf hero a
mile in the actual writing and mechanics of
some of the novels and essays i am inclined to
agree with innman poe is certainly a better
writer than kipling in forcefulness and direct-
ness of expression but is that really the im-
portant side of the matter is a story about a
bogey-man of more worth than twains also
a fantasy by the way a connecticut yankee
which tells forcefully of the social and political
conditions in england at a certain time in her
history weigh each one carefully in that light
i cant see how you can fail to agree with me
lionel in the mechanics of writing andor the
technics you are right in some cases but in
actual worth never a true classic even the
fantastic ones of shakespeare which you men-
tioned have a direct or indirect relationship with
the solid concrete things that make up our lives
but a true fantasy conceivably but of what
possible use could the story the new adam be
to me the idea behind the story is possible but
not probable therefore any use i could gain
from it is to repeat possible but extremely im-
probable except as i mentioned before when

pertaining to the science of writing i hope ive
proven my point i could go on for pages and
pages on all the fine points raised but i think
that what ive said will suffice to convey my
meaning

  by the way i vote innman second place
because although im forced to disagree with
him he very ably stated his argument in fact
ill admit he had me pretty well stumped until
i figured just why i thought that kipling was
better than poe

   i guess that just about closes my letter besides
 a pat on the back to gardner fox who it seems
 is going to turn out to be another van vogt

dear editor

  how many times ive taken up my pen to
write to you i do not know but i know that
for twelve years ive been an avid reader of all
magazines in this line

   i am one of those rare people who is an un-
scientific science-fiction fan i readily admit that
my interest in this kind of fiction comes from
the buck rogers comics though i find them
dull and uninteresting today

   i read the stories for the stories sake scien-
 tific data is all greek to me and i dont even
 try to understand it this i imagine is true of
 a great many of your readers so if an unlet-
 tered girl can comment on your stories here
 goes

   in the winter  issue you have two stories
that vie for top honors this time im not going
to say which is best for i dont know the great
green blight by emmett mcdowell and man-nth
by gardner f fox both kept me with my nose
buried in the book when i should have been do-
ing other things

  passage to planet x by henry hasse came
next i felt that george ketrik would be an
interesting man to know

   as to the rest they were fair but the ulti-
mate world seemed rather pointless for some-
how i just cant picture man ever going to sleep
as a nation i think they would find something
to do to give them a reason to live

 in the visigraph the best letters were written
 by larry shaw guy trucano jr im a re-

sublican too and lionel innman i agree with
im that there are many great writers in the field
of fantasy fiction in closing i like your maga-
zine so keep it coming

sincerely

dear editor

  volume  of planet stories is off to a very
good start now if the other eleven issues are
as good-

  the great green blight by mcdowell was a
fine story with merely adequate illustrations
and a terrible title as i recall the blight was
rust-colored and even so the title gave away
the ending to anyone with an elementary knowl-
edge of botany but i like the story

steel giants of chaos by adams had an in-
teresting idea but it was run into the ground
	planet

with overuse the illustrations were pleasantly
primitive was that intentional

  passage to planet x was another variation on
the old theme of men fleeing from tyrants in
one place and finding others elsewhere how-
ever hasses skill in characterization made it
an excellent story the picture was not good

  man-nth was the gem of the entire issue
i have come across good stories before in
planet but no novelet as good as this fox
deserves a medal for this story i dont know
if the idea is scientifically possible but it was
carried to a remorselessly logical end doolins
pictures though inaccurate were enough above
the average to classify them as good

  concerning the diversijal all i can say is that
rocklynne hasnt departed from his usual high
standards but why this fine story had to be
afflicted with such an awful picture-i time-
travel stories frequently give me a headache
this was a very pleasant exception

  the ultimate world was the ultimate in irony
neat tale neatly executed the illustration was
decidedly above the average

  venusian invader had a deceptive title never-
theless it was a good story is sternig a new
author the name is unfamiliar

  as seems to be customary for the ringers
the drawing was good and the joke was not
oh for the days when guy gifford used to write
letters that were really funny 

  in re the visigraph the best letters in my
opinion were those by lionel innman chad
oliver and larry shaw the first two -were
good because they had something to say the
last was the most delightfully nutty letter ive
seen in a long time and as far as the bug-eyed
monsters are concerned we couldnt get rid of
them with anything short of an atomic bomb-
the artists appear so devoted to them-there-
fore why not allow them their little moment of
triumph	sincerely

dear editor

    this is my first attempt at criticism and it
may be my last-anyway i am sticking my neck
out for the reply if you dont like the stories
then why read them-theyre all alike

  years ago i read the series of martian adven-
tures of john carter by edgar r burroughs and
have been hoping to recapture the thrill those
stories gave me so far i have not succeeded
it may have been my age but i never give up
hope

  most stf magazines mix science and fiction so
that theres fiction where science should be and
vice versa there are those stories where the
author is so overcome by his own cleverness in
giving scientific detail that the fiction part is lost

  then there should be a standard space geogra-
phy that is my main objection author a
depicts mars as a jungle author b has mars
ultra civilized arthur c has mars entirely de-
serted and author d rings in an entirely unheard
of planet in connection with mars

  it is true that one mans guess about mars
is as good as anothers but somehow the stories
lose all their effectiveness would it be possible
for those who write planet stories to get to-
gether on a geography

  my spleen is vent ed sorry to hear that

  now for good clean constructive criticism
dont laugh not yet there is one author i think
planet should have a lot of his stories would
truly stimulate the mag that authors name is
-ha-ha-ha-millard grimes okay now you
can laugh ugh ed more spleen

  while i am in such a gay mood i think i
shall ridicule the cover a bit it isnt bad in fact
its the best youve had for quite a spell i espe-
cially like the color scheme but the girl who
although quite charming no doubt does not be-
long on the cover of a mag like yours im just
wondering how much your circulation would
increase if you would do away with your cover
girl ed no cover gals-no circulation i
mean me with all respect to larry shaw i
will say im not against having bems on the
cover they are really symbols of sf but why
not have just one well-drawn bem with a nice
colorful background instead of trying to tell a
story with your cover or have one man falling
as he is rayed from above in other words
simple covers

  now for some real deserving praise

  ah the stories they really had some meat on
em this ish just like old times all were good
but tops was mcdowells novel this boy can
really and i do mean really paint good
characters at least to my feeble literary brain
these characters especially jennifer were al-
most as good as the ones in mcdowells red
witch

  the visi was excellent this time although it
had been falling off a number of oldtimers
were back but there are still many of them
missing  oliver-for writing again 
shaw-same  terrio-for the hit parade
of ps stories i like terrio took a census of
my pss and also have a line-up of favorites
i sincerely hope you will print this list maybe
it will encourage others to send in their list of
top tales my pss are limited but i have every
issue since march  and so all of my choices
come from the issues following this one

  	lazarus come forth-bradbury probably
no one will agree with me on this but this story
had an ending what an ending

  	wanderers of the wolf moon-bond one
of the few stories ive read in planet that i
was truly sorry when it ended

  	alcatraz of the starways-depina and
hasse if only they could get back together
any chance

  	crypt-city of the deathless one-kutt-
ner another good close

   mr meek plays polo-simak read it over
again youll really get a kick out of it

  	one against the stars-garson im just a
sucker for tragic ends

  	jewel of bas-brackett brackett has writ-
ten so many good ones shes my favorite author
but where has she been lately

  	red witch of mercury-mcdowell good
characters

  	citadel of death-selwyn the best of the
thud and blunder tales

  	joe carsons weapon-adams it was so
different

  this list was made before i read the present
issue so naturally its stories do not count if
they had green blight would have been in the
first ten for sure and maybe steel giants of
chaos

   as this is my first fan letter id better start
off with some personal history i am a member
of the merchant marine my family is in min-
nesota mother father and ten brothers and
sisters im free and  single but available
if your secretary is blonde   ft  inches
and  pounds or so send her my address
ed well do that i first started reading sf
when i was nine years old my family has
always considered me a bit soft between the ears
for reading that trash but i think im vin-
dicated now i was glad to meet my old friends
the b e ms and needle-gun but whatever be-
came of the rocket pistol years ago every story
bristled with them oh well time marches on

  it seems as if i heard of chad oliver before
if i ever get down galveston way tell him ill
drop in and say hello now to rate the stories

  	the great green blight the idea of in-
telligent plants was okay

  	the ultimate world a new treatment of
an old theme and theory fine

  	the venusian invader fast moving well
constructed orchids

  the rest of them are good but nothing extra
except perhaps man-nth that was a good story
although the theory of straight light appears
slightly crooked to me

  do you realize that i was never actually sure
what a bern was sure everyone talked about
them but no one bothered to explain what they
were i used to lie awake at nights my feeble
brain striving to puzzle out the mystery and
soon my parents would tip-toe in their brows
wrinkled with worry and softly ask what was
troubling me in a voice fraught with emotion
i would look up at them and say bern i then
with a sad shake of their heads they would
quietly walk away

  so you see something had to be done so
i sat down and patiently deciphered bern
b-brute e-energetic m-monster i had it
a bern is an energetic brute of a monster
then i picked up the winter issue of planet
and there he was a beautiful green bern doing
heavens knows what with a partly-clad beauty
ah parkhurst i thank you

  now we come to my thoughts i really have
those things on the stories 

  	the great green blight swell i i have
no other words to describe it and for once i
have no kicks

  	mannth i liked this almost as much as
the first one i got all tangled up in that hyper-
space business but i finally made it back to
earth

  	passage to planet x not enough action
you always feel on the outside of this story
it just didnt get me or do i make myself con-
fusing 

  	a toss-up between the ultimate world and
the diversifal no comments

  	venusian invader was just a brain-teaser
a sort of who-done-it only this time it was a
where-is-the-body

  and now ill lay down my arsenic-tipped pen
until next time

dear editor

  although-yea-many moons have passed since
yours truly last sent a letter planet-ward i
have been following the progress of the mag
with interest and a certain amount of anxiety
to be sure ps is definitely on the upswing with
such memorable tales as foxs the last mon-
ster and the exceptional contributions of brack-
ett and de pina still i kinda miss the old
days when rip-roarin adventure went hand-in-
hand with the human interest element and yarns
with a radically new twist werent frowned upon
that was the hey-day of rocklynne and mosko-
witz and even binders vastly overrated vas-
sals of the master world

  i always hie me down to the newsstand the
first of every third month and this time was
no exception the winter issue was piled high
upon the groaning mag-rack that cover  i like
it though i confess to a secret love of bems
color-scheme is indeed attractive-but tsk the
hair of the heroine seems to be of a slightly
greenish tint hmmm

  artwork seems to be on the usual standard
kiemle and murphy are perhaps the best of the
lot though the chap who illustrated hasses
tale shows promise the ringers were cute

  the visigraph still reigns as top letter column
in the field but dash it all there were too
many brief listings of stories in order of pref-
erence this is okay still i know damned well
nobody gives a hoot as to which stories in this
issue i liked   

  lew sherlocks letter seems to go off the deep
end as to science ah well perhaps somebody
will take him up on it and well have a nice
juicy discussion of physics goody goody joy
joy

  chad olivers letter was interesting as per
usual i regret that im not so enthused as chad
is over cummings writings still the guy has
written some classics of stf in the pre-historic
days wish hed keep it up

  eisners letter was good he has my vote for
first place

  vernon cooper gets second

  in third place my sympathies are torn twixt
guy trucano and the utterly mad humor of
larry shaw call it a tie if you will

  lionel innmans letter gives us some food
for thought however it seems rather fanciful
that any of the stuff being currently dished out
	planet stories

by a handful of sf pulps can be in any way
considered as lasting literature even wein-
baums work is hardly deserving of the term
classic while such greats as merritt and
lovecraft rarely wrote anything that could be
classed as science-fiction about the only recog-
nized classics of stf that can be given as an
example of the literary quality of futuristic fic-
tion are some of the novels of h g wells
come now lionel-you cant class poe as a
science-fiction author unless you consider such
mildewed classics as the great balt-n hoax
or the more impressive facts in the case of
m valdemar as sf there is always the ques-
tion of course as to just where the dividing line
lies between stf fantasy and weird fiction to
be sure shakespeare wrote several plays that
are fantastic yet fantasy and science-fiction arc
two different things entirely at least according
to my book even kipling wrote a number of
excellent stories of the supernatural-particu-
larly they and the return of imray at any
rate innmans communique was interesting and
the kind the viz should have more of this
topic however might make a better fanzine
article than a subject for open discussion in a
letter column like ive just been doing ha

  gentle hint to a certain editor when is
planet going bi-monthly again now that the
wars overf ha in times gone by the editors
could merely shake their heads when any such
suggestions were proffered solemnly pointing
out that the paper shortage made such thoughts
impossible but now-well well se   

  oh before i forget it the new design on the
spine of the magazine is veddy veddy nice it
deserves a hearty belch of appreciation can do
ulp-burp

  with these dubious words of wisdom i sink
once more into the murky slime and ooze to
dwell in sober contemplation upon the great
mystery as to what makes people read science-
fiction anyway   

sincerely

  half a volume of planets have come tum-
bling off the press since ive last taken the
musty cover off this triper to pound out a note
to the visigraph now i suppose im an atavist
-a throwback-and once again the spell has
come upon me so creeping out of my shell-
i emerge the happy g of old a bit worn by
the ways of life perhaps-but ready once again
for the rigors of a cruise through mystery
through terror stark and unreal-through the
visigraph

  all fans please note this mr whitehorn is
a nice guy-young and pleasant-and he likes
the same stories that we do you can expect a
new era of planet stories with tales of scope
and vastness and atmosphere-which came
straight from the lips of the editor well
almost straight anyway    p s-mr white-
horn is also crazy about little white peppermints
-you know the kind with the hole in the middle
and he sits around munching them all day while
rejecting manuscripts drawings paintings etc

  the thing that really brought me out of my
mental lethargy long enough to type this letter
was ross rocklynnes short story the diversi-
fal it is different from any story published in
ps to date it does not follow the general trend

of planets formula it-to say things mildly-
was a classic it was so good as a matter of
fact as to be un-pulp-ish it is the very best
thing printed in planet since binders unfor-
gettable vassals so long ago from the above
sentences you may perhaps be led to believe
that i liked it and how

  you have discovered a very good writer in
gardner f fox his man-nth is really an ex-
cellent bit of work and different too more

  there wasnt really a bad story in the entire
winter issue mcdowell did a very nice job with
his novel-and it sure was good to see the
long-awaited return of henry hasse

  poor walton-he of the ultimate world-
he must be a down-trodden individual indeed-to
think of civilization and life-and and every-
thing-the way he did a good yarn though
-and for bws sake i hope he doesnt feel that
way in real life why should he accept your
pay-check why eat why do anything its all
pointless a waste of cosmic time why live
bah a waste of cosmic time a boring exist-
ence worth not a darn

 as for the art work-well-whyinell
mention the cover -sniff sniff-itll get us no-
where murphy is good verily so so is potter
who you seemed to have canned several issues
back sadly i notice that doolin is still hanging
around all in all you can use a couple of new
ink-slingers-or a return of some of the old boys

  with less than half a double-spaced page to
go id better start condensing this material so

  give visiprizes to oliver glad youre back
chad-an look im here too trucano and
the-uh-desperate mr shaw    atomic

dear editor

  just finished reading your mag and enjoyed
every minute of it and have been enjoying it for
the past three issues this is the first time ive
taken my pen in hand to write and tell you of
my likes and dislikes

  ill start with the cover which is the first
thing i saw and ive always heard you should
start with the first of anything and continue on

  after reading all the stories i then looked
at the cover again but i failed to see any con-
nection between the cover and any story in the
magazine oh dont get me wrong im not say-
ing its not good because i think it is but it has
no connection with any story and i think the
cover should come from one of the stories any-
way dont you think so how about that vizi-
graph fans

  heres my ratings of the stories

  	the great green blight-mcdowell very
good action all the way through how about
some more

  	man-nth-fox enjoyed this very much
wished it had of been longer nice plot

 	passage to planet x-hasse ketrik
vizigraph	

sounds very interesting would like to read more
of his adventures

  	the diversifal-rocklynne something dif-
ferent if only he could have someone to tell us
when not to take a vrong step well we do
come to think of it our conscience if we stop
and think

  	steel giants of chaos-adams lots of ad-
venture and very exciting enjoyed it a lot

  	venusian invader-sternig good detective
story

  	the ultimate world-walton just didnt
like it

  guy giffords the ringers was amusing
the pictures were pretty good especially  of
them page  by pious and page  by hol-
lingsworth these are good for action but the
ones on page  and page  are my favorites
the ringer boys gets tacked up in my bedroom

  in reading the vizigraph letters i find one
from san antonio my own home town and i
thoroughlv agree with him in his idea of a small
card to acknowledge our small contributions to
the p s mag im sure they would and i
would too be willing to send a penny post card
along

  concerning george fox norman ruggles and
richard rosen they write pretty rotten gripe
letters but ive always heard theres one in every
crowd

  favorite letters are edwin sylers prpohe-
cies and may they never come true chad oliver
i quite agree with you about roy cummings
i liked his juggernaut of space very much

dear editor

  after i mention the fact that this is my first
letter to planet stories and also that the last
monster by gardner f fox was the best story
in the fall issue i will start on the winter 
number

  as for the front cover it met with my full ap-
proval that enviable monster sure knows how to
pick em man if only my luck was as good  but
then again i must lack something of his could
   could it be his tentacles

  now for the stories three stand out as excel-
lent passage to planet x by henry hasse comes
first affording me the most enjoyment it had
everything that makes up a worthwhile yarn-
action excitement suspense good dialogue next
is james r adams steel giants of chaos fol-
lowed by the great green blight by emmett
mcdowell those stories alone were worth the
price of the magazine

considering the illustrations my vote goes to

c	a murphy i like his style is there any
chance at all of obtaining the work of virgil
finlay alex schomburg frank r paul  those
are the masters r s pious did a good job on
page seventy-one

  planet stories has a very very fine readers
page in the vizigraph in which a marked friend-
liness and comradery prevails i cant help but
notice it

  well summing up your publication i consider
it one of which you can be justly proud i find a
sort of air about it comparable with those pioneer
science fiction magazines of the late twenties

  keep up the good work and the very best of
luck 

sincerely yours

dear editor

  here we go again why is it that in every issue
there is someone in the vizigraph who has to
disagree with me on my most fanatic-minded sub-
jects ray cummings the type of letter in the
viz and the cover in the past and in spite of
myself i have retained some vestige of respect
and fondness for ray karden just look in the
back issues and youll find it proven but now he
opens up on the covers saying the latest one
was n g and one of the reasons was because
it followed the old pattern i should like to ask
in a very mild and controlled tone of voice just
what in h- is the matter with that old pat-
tern on man woman and bem any cover
must more or less follow a pattern of a space-
ship triangle etc the triangle pattern must
be pleasing to a good many people of the thou-
sands who buy the mag there must be a good
share who either like this cover or at least dont
care enough to say anything about it i for one
like it i can see where others would not like it
but i also have an idea that a good many who do
write in about it just write to have something to
beef about

  and now to bring the tears to the eyes of this
issues authors to mcdowell for his great
green blight i can give nothing but praise as
likewise to fox for man-nth both of them tie
for first place by far the best stories in the issue
i liked man a little bit better although i couldnt
tell you why adams and steel giants of chaos
runs a close second it really should have been
saved for first place in another issue or are all
the issues henceforth to be as good as this one
was i hope so rocklynnes diversifal and wal-
tons ultimate world are next ties both rather
disappointed me not because they were not ex-
cellent stories but because of the way they ended
not a happy ending which is the usual thing
because of this difference they were more in-
teresting than they probably would have been
sternigs venusian invader takes last place but
it is still nothing to be ashamed of in many other
issues the story would have been well up on the
list but when the other blood and thunder stories
were so much better it didnt stand a chance

  i have a word of comfort and pity for shaw
and his dangerous bug-eyed monster it is this
in that dim future of which he sneaks there was
a revolt among the bug-eyed monsters they be-
gan to think that occasionally they should be
allowed to keep the heroines without the boy
friends butting in the rest of the bems prompt-
ly decided that rather than let such a horrible
thing happen they would ban themselves from
covers that is why the thing which visited you
insisted that you should write in favor of the
monsters if enough people want them in any
way they can have their women and stay on the
covers also another word of comfort to shaw
if your friend gets too menacing mix yourself
a bromo and take a cold shower it usually
works

  oh by the way if any of you intelligent fans
look at the first part of this masterpiece youll
notice that i am in favor of the triangle the
reason for this you see is that if people want
the triangle they will keep us normal bems
on the cover and at the same time will have
their women protected by the hero if like
shaw they write only for the bems they will
lose their hero and also the women sorta in-
volved aint it
	planet

  so i as president of the united society for
the protestion and perpetuation of alt lawabid-
ing bems earnestly ask you to quit panning
the triangle help save our victims

dear cw

  want to add a bit about last ish of planet
just because i write a little doesnt mean i dont
enjoy reading them too and since i get panned
quite frequently id just as soon pan back inci-
dentally the steel giants yarn in the last issue
parallels my switched egos in survival not yet
published to an amazing degree wish now i
had sold it under my gene ellerman monicker
its odd how often heros names story ideas and
plots sprout in several authors imaginations at
the same time seen it happen dozens of times
art burks mentioned it in a writers digest
article

  liked green blight man-nth -vesuvian in-
vader and planet x the best the other three
were good stories too but not up to the others
it seemed to me the viz is rolling along in the
same old rut again with asimov gone and
buchanon silenced or silent something new is
needed planets letter column was unusually
interesting when the mag started then the
plague of nicknames and wisecracks  came
upon us-but is gradually fading again-and now
maybe the grade of letters will go up might i
suggest a puzzle to increase the quality and
quantity of letters would be this-publish two
of your stories without authors names and give
the first correct identifications a couple of origi-
nals fans brag they can spot an author an es-
tablished one at least by his language i wonder 
might be tho youd be snowed under-so forget
i mentioned it

  once just once id like a cover sans humans
and pink flesh where space-suiting should be
applied how about a couple of other male and
female monskers pitching woo or a spacer mak-
ing port i know its the policy of the mag to
have the romantic angle pictured but an occa-
sional offtrail would attract readers who shy
off from the nuder gender as pictured on the
covers most of the yarns arent even slightly
sexy so i fail to get the connection but then im
notoriously dense about a lot of things inside
illustrates are better than average and now that
ive blowed off steam i must confess this win-
ter cover is rather attractive-comely wench
and the hero is not in the foreground-in fact i
like it it still goes tho that lots of potential
readers get the wrong idea

  wasted plenty of your time as it is so i better
sign off we stfans are a mouthy breed time
wasted on correspondence would build a few
gross of novels i imagine

dear editor

  i am  years old and a student of little rock
high school ive been reading your mag for
three years now and i love it just lately ive

stories

been reading the vizigraph and found out how
entertaining it can be too those letters which
give the authors ratings of the stories arent
very interesting though

  the winter edition was grand only one story
didnt have much plot action or description-
the ultimate world

  as to the cover im all in favor of beautiful
girl with few clothes since that seems to be the
style hero and villain but i do think the cover
ought to either illustrate the story accurately or
else be about something not in the mag at all
novel idea dont you think your last cover
showed the plant man with octopus-like arms
while in the story the plant men had five leafy
fingers besides that coloring

  sometime you ought to let your artist read the
whole story select a dramatic action scene that
contains the lady hero and villain and then
draw it as described by the author

  if i were an artist my cover would have been
an illustration from man-nth about the best
story in the mag jonathan stands on the
sanded arena in front of his ivory throne his
face is beaded with sweat and in his hand is a
baseball bat the lovely lavender lady with her
hair loose and an expression of incredulity on
her face stands off to one side of him morka
kar laughing derisively is seated on his ebony
throne in front of both thrones are the closed
manomachy caskets in the background the white
marble benches filled with watching thousands
rosy pillars rise from the arena and in the blue
of the sky the black flames burn

  vernon coopers idea of a post card to ac-
knowledge letters received is pretty good there-
fore i enclose a stamped addressed card to see
if this ever reaches anybody ed the card in-
cidentally was answered

  the only real objection i have to planet is
that it comes out so seldom dan wilhite was
quite correct in saying that arkansans can get
theirs without fear of ridicule i buy mine on
main street right in front of the commercial
national bank

  gazing at the latest planet stories i see the
same old theme a guy a gal and a bem al-
though this latest one could be called a lam
long armed monster even though your gals
arent overdressed at least they have more on
than the other mags have ed note do they
shucks not that i mind but my mother you
know the cover is purty good but why are all
your covers so rough ed note we walk on
em after we buy em gives em distinction

  now the stories   the great green
blight-very interesting liked it very much

	steel giants of chaos-started off good the
rest was a letdown  passage to planet x-
good  mannth-excellent  the diversi-
fal-different i enjoyed it  the ultimate
world-not bad not good  venusian invader
