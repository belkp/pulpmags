        quarter-mile bend

eally there could be no
question that the car had
got away from her stan-
ley downs driving his
high-powered archimedes
down the winding moun-
tain road had noticed the
girl eight or ten miles
back and had admired the ease with
which she managed the rakish six-cyl-
inder in the many difficult spots where
strength as well as skill was demanded
to keep the road

she was a slim bright-faced young
woman he knew that because he had
had one good look at her pretty face as
she swung around a hairpin turn and
passed him on the lower road while
lie traveled to the bend on the upper

he had taken a chance in looking

ra

sideways while preparing to negotiate
the cruel bend with his own car he
should have kept his attention straight
ahead without regard to any girl
pretty or otherwise who might be pass-
ing two hundred feet away and who
certainly was paying no attention to
him 

  thats a fanchon shes driving
karl remarked stanley to his chauf-
feur who sat idly by his side its a
new car and  dont know whether it
is dependable or not it has speed and
the lines are graceful and strong but
until a car has been well tried out you
never know where a weakness will de-
velop

  the fanchons a good car pro-
nounced karl briefly

  glad you know that karl because
it- hello what does that mean 

  karl suddenly came to life as when
they got around the bend he as well


wide-awake magazine

as stanley saw that the fanchon was
moving faster and faster and more-
over was swaying from side to side in
a wild manner which to their experi-
enced eyes told its own story

  somethings slipped karl shes
lost control

  she sure has and theres the lake
and bridge at the end of the short quar-
ter-mile turn she cant make the
bridge at that speed

  of course she cant returned
stanley excitedly as he opened up his
own gas a few notches theres an
ugly twist there merciful heaven  if
she strikes the bend like that only one
thing can happen shell shoot into
fifty feet of water

  unless she hits the stonework of the

bridge approach then-

  shut up snapped stanley we
cant let her do it we have five miles
in that distance we ought to be able to
help

  karl did not reply he knew how
quickly five miles can be covered in an
automobile

  stanley drove faster and faster the
girl had nearly got to the next bend
which was one of the awful s turns
he saw that she was bending low over
her wheel prepared to serpentine her
way around at full speed if it could be
done

  the lord send that she doesnt meet
anything- murmured stanley as he
put on more power what are we do-
ing karl

  fifty replied karl glancing at
the speedometer

  fifty miles an hour well well
have to go up to sixty-perhaps more
stanley downs gritted his teeth
forced his car up to sixty miles an
hour and then reduced the speed to
thirty they were approaching the
s

  the girl was just running out of it
her car rocking awfully as she reached
the straight

  well shes out of that remarked
stanley i was afraid shed never do
it by jove shes some driver

  the archimedes being under con-
trol went through the s safely at
forty miles an hour then stanley
downs set himself to catch the other
car

  he was not clear as to what he would
do if he did catch it but he was re-
solved to do something there was an-
other sharp bend ahead close to the
broad lake with its stone wall and many
boat landings after that came an-
other twist taking the road straight
upon the long bridge that crossed the
water

  as the fanchon whizzed around 
two wheels stanley saw that the fair
driver was leaning far to one side to
throw the weight of her body against
the inclination of the car to tip over
she was game to the core stanley
downs would have sworn to that

  doesnt seem scared shouted karl
above the roaring of the car as it gath-
ered more speed

  nerve of pure steel replied stan-
ley through his clenched teeth karl
well 

  get ready to take this wheel-with-
out stopping the car

  great scott thats going to be
some stunt declared karl but loosen-
ing himself up at the same time ready
to obey whats the idea

  you see that we are getting to that
last twist in the road the quarter mile
sure all right ready to do it
now 

  just a moment wait till i get my
feet clear so that i can swing out as
you go in behind the wheel get me
yes

  the two cars were not far apart now
the girl was holding to the steering
wheel with a desperate grip her feet
 the pedals trying to make the foot
brake hold the emergency hand brake
had given out long ago and the other
the speedway of fate



seemed to have hardly any power but
she was fighting every inch to regain
control

  by this time a score of people who
had been strolling along the high-ter-
raced walk above the roadway which
overlooked the lake were watching the
two great cars swirling down toward
the quarter-mile turn

  they were accustomed to seeing cars
moving at a good speed after safely
negotiating this difficult bend but it
was unusual for machines to approach
it in this headlong fashion

  at each of the bends was a gigantic
signboard painted a terrifying red
bearing the word danger in white
letters two feet long and with the ad-
ditional caution in rather smaller char-
acters  sharp curve ahead drive
slow

  there was hardly time for the spec-
tators to express their horror at the
catastrophe that seemed imminent
when the two cars swept along side by
side

  now shouted stanley

  he knew that he could depend on
karl that rather taciturn young man
had proved his courage and intelligence
on other occasions it was his habit to
do what came his way without making
much fuss about it and if the task men-
aced his safety or even his life why
it was all in the days work

  ready sir replied karl

  all right come 

  stanley slid along the seat from be-
hind the wheel and immediately karl
was in his place recovering the slight
divergence of the car that had been
caused by the change of guiding hands

  it was now that stanley downs had
a good view of the girls face

  it could not be said that she was not
frightened but certainly her appre-
hension had not interfered with the
masterly manner in which she managed
the steering wheel she was staring
straight ahead of her and as she

whirled around the quarter-mile bend
she endeavored to get the car headed
up the road

  but there was another hairpin curve
-caiied so because the two roads ran
almost parallel like the legs of a hair-
pin-and the car would have to swing
completely around running in the op-
posite direction if it were to avoid the
lake

  she cant make it exclaimed karl

  stanley downs said nothing karl
had been obliged to let the fanhon
push a little ahead in rounding the
bend to avoid a collision and stanley
was standing on the seat by the side of
the chauffeur balancing himself peril-
ously on the leather cushion with his
eyes fixed on the girl

  he motioned with his arm to karl
to draw closer to the other car

  they were within a hundred yards of
the edge of the lake and charging
straight toward it

  as karl brought the two cars within
a yard of each other stanley leaped
across the gap and into the front seat
of the fanchon

  what followed happened too quickly
to be described in detail

  with a savage tug he dragged the
girl away from the wheel at the same
time kicking open the door then he
seized the wheel with both hands as he
stood by the side of it and wrenched
it so hard that the car swerved until it
seemed as if it might run along the road
at the very edge of the water

  the wrencl was not quite enough
however its only effect was to pre-
vent its going straight into the lake
instead it shot off diagonally and with
the car went stanley downs and the
girl

  the tremendous splash caused by the
diving in of the fanchon was followed
instantly by another as the archi-
medes with karl at the wheel plunged
off the stone wall and turning a com-


wide-awake magazine

plete somersault disappeared beneath
the surface

  only a number of bubbles in the
center of two rapidly spreading series
of rings told the frantic people who
had rushed to the edge of the lake that
two cars with three human beings had
sunk there

  then the cap of the chauffeur still
on his head where it was fastened by
a chin strap showed above the surface
as karl swam toward a wooden boat

    

landing

  where were the other two-stanley
downs and the girl

  the question was soon answered
stanley and the girl came up together

  there was a streak of red across the
forehead and cheek of the young man
but the beautiful face that lay against
his shoulder was a dead white and the
eyes were closed

  stanley downs was pale himself and
there was a dazed expression in his eyes
as he shook the water out of them and
looked about for the shore

  in another moment he obtained a
grip on himself and struck out for
the boat landing where karl was by
this time being helped out

  it was with difficulty that stanley
swam the short distance he had re-
ceived a nasty knock as he broke away
from the car under water and it had
weakened him moreover he had the
weight of the girl he was bringing to
shore she was unable to help herself
all she could do was to lie prone on
his arm her brown hair rippling over
the water and one small gauntleted
hand resting on his shoulder and against
his cheek

chapter ii

stanleys mission

i think i can walk were the first
words she spoke as they were
dragged out of the water

  t dont think you can returned

stanley downs positively i will
carry you

  he did so there were half a dozen
stone steps from the wooden boat land-
ing to the top of the wall from there
it was a trip of some five hundred feet
to the veranda of the hotel which faced
the broad lake and the magnificent vista
of mountain where the verdure-clad
slopes were bursting into the fresh
green beauty of spring

  stanley had recovered most of his
strength by the time he was pulled from
the water besides he rather liked the
task of carrying this dainty young
woman whose independence of spirit
had manifested itself with the first
glimmer of returning consciousness

  wont you put me down please
she asked with a touch of imperious-
ness

  couldnt do it answered stanley
as he hurried toward the veranda
you would fall

  nonsense im not so weak as all
that where is my car

  at the bottom of the lake i guess
  and yours

  by its side-or perhaps underneath
or on top of yours we all went in
together

  her eyes-deep-violet eyes they were
as stanley downs saw-were wide
open by this time and it was clear that
her mind was working in orderly fash-
ion no matter how distressed she might
be physically

  i am too heavy for you to carry
she persisted you are badly hurt
there is a great cut in your forehead
put me down

  you dont weigh much he laughed
it steadies me to carry you a hun-
dred pounds or so in my arms is what
i need to keep me balanced

  i weigh a hundred and thirty she
burst out indignantly i may not be
very big but i play tennis and i swim

as well as-

  and drive a six-cylinder fanchon
the speedway of fate

threw in stanley that keeps you in
good condition yes i understand
that but when a young lady is hurled
out of a car into a lake and especially
when she has some little difficulty in
getting clear of the wreckage she must
expect to feel a little shaken

  you threw that door of the car open
just before we went over the wall
she remarked with a smile that
showed you had not lost your head but
for that i might not have got clear i
wonder you thought of it-so quickly
quickness of thought was needed
at that stage of the proceedings if the
thought was to do any good well
here we are at the veranda ill carry
you up the steps and then you will be
all right here is a lady who seems to
know you

  stanley downs put his burden down
gently on the broad veranda and drew
a large wicker chair to her as he did
so a middle-aged motherly sort of
woman in a light-blue morning gown
came running up and took the girls two
hands in hers

  why miss ranvelt what is this
was it you that went crashing into the
lake i heard that there had been an

accident but i never supposed-

  never supposed it was i mrs
somers laughed the girl  hy not 
it was just as likely as to be anybody
else im always racing around in a
motor car ou know that dad says
ill get into a bad mess some time it
seems as if i came near it this morn-
ing

  came near it  grunted karl who
had followed close behind stanley
how much closer does she want to
come 

  karls voice brought stanley sharply
to a recollection of something of great
importance to himself that he had for-
gotten all about in the excitement-
even after he had found himself safe
with the girl in his arms

  he waved a farewell to the young

lady who was being hurried away to
the housekeepers own rooms for dry
clothes and general attention and
turned to karl

  the money

  it went down with the car replied
karl  had no time to get at it and
you were in the other car it was in
the door pocket in front with the latch
fastened it ought to be there now

  yes yes agreed stanley nerv-
ously it ought the door pocket is
not waterproof but it will keep some
of the water away perhaps anyhow
it will keep it all in oneplace then
there is a thick wrapping of brown pa-
per over it that ought to help

  twenty thousand dollars isnt it
asked karl

  hush no need to tell everybody
warned stanley but thats what there
is a little more than twenty thou-
sand

  hello stan broke in a cheery
voice as a brawny brown hand seized
stanleys what have you been doing
to yourself youre soaking wet by
george  so is karl what in thunder
is it all about

  fell into the lake replied stanley
briefly where did you come from
clay

  adirondacks cold as the deuce up
there too early in the year so i
just turned my gas wagon in this di-
rection and im bound for new york
it is the only place for civilized beings
in may

  clay varron was a member of the
thracian club-the athletic organiza-
tion in new york to which stanley
downs also belonged-and the two
young men were good friends their
mutual liking was based on respect for
both were clean-living bright young
fellows who enjoyed athletic sports as
earned recreation without making them
the principal business in life

  among other reasons for clay yar-
ron and stanley downs being good


wide-awake magazine

comrades was that botli were ardent
motorists clay had done seventy
miles an hour on the road and stanley
downs would have beaten that record
in the opinion of the thracian club
if he had not been dissuaded on the
ground that more than seventy miles an
hour away from a regular track would
be idiocy rather than good sportsman-
ship

  got any clothes with you asked
stanley

  plenty ive engaged a room here
at the hotel come up to it until you
get one for yourself wheres my

man where the deuce- oh here

you are he added as a trim-looking
fellow with body servant written all
over him stood at his employers el-
bow whats the number of my
room here at the ridgeview moran

  forty-three sir suite-bedroom
sitting room and bath baggage is
there already clothes laid out too

  clay varron winked at stanley
downs and grinned pleasantly

  i believe if  were in a shipwreck
at night in the middle of the atlantic
moran would have my clothes laid out
in regular order so that i could be
drowned properly dressed he said
with a chuckle well theres nothing
like doing your work right whether you
are president of the united states or a
valet come on well get you out of
those wet rags in two minutes once you
are in my room your chauffeur can
look out for himself i suppose

  while karl sought warmth and dry
clothes in another part of the great
rambling hotel-finally bringing up
with a chauffeur he knew-stanley
downs went up to clay varrons apart-
ments

  half an hour later stanley and clay
sat at the window of the private sit-
ting room which overlooked the lake
from the second story while stanley
told his story to varron

  theres not much to it clay you

know colonel prentiss and some other
men are managing this big automobile
race for the lawrence gold cup and a
purse of twenty thousand dollars
of course i know it isnt that one
of the reasons im hustling back to
new york i want to hear what they
think of the race at the thracian-first-
hand its one week from to-day isnt
it 

  yes

  and tickets are being taken up very
fast im told i want to get parking
space for two machines wheres the
best place to look for the tickets im
told the new speedway will be a won-
der one man told me that there will
be accommodation for nearly a hun-
dred thousand people to see the races
pretty nearly that admitted stan-
ley you can get tickets in new york
ill manage that for you

  why are you interested asked
clay varron rather surprised

  only as an official of the bank of
bunvin  son in new york city my
uncle richard burwin is the sole
owner of the bank as i think you
know

  varron nodded and waved a hand
for stanley downs to continue

  because he is the sole owner he in-
sists on doing things in his own way
colonel prentiss has been selling many
tickets in buffalo and he found him-
self with more cash than he wanted to
take care of he is like my uncle in
the way of having notions and he will
not do business with any bank except
burwin  son that is why he would
not deposit any of his cash in banks at
buffalo or elsewhere as he might have
done

  i see drive ahead stan get
down to cases

  my uncle sent me to buffalo to get
twenty thousand dollars that colonel
premiss wanted to deposit with us i
was not allowed to use the railroads-
i didnt want to for that matter-but
the speedway of fate



was to go in my own car with karl
who is my uncles own chauffeur to
drive when i got tired and to help me
guard the money

  swell idea observed clay varron
but i never knew the day when stan-
ley downs couldnt take care of him-
self-and of anything he was told to
keep safely

  stanley got up from his chair and
strode up and down the room in a
suit of light clothes belonging to clay
 arron which fitted him almost as well
as if they had been made for him stan-
ley was a fine-looking specimen of the
american man in his twenties

  his erect carriage firm jaw quick
eye and alert bearing were all those of
the young man who does things even
the troubled expression that drew his
brows together and made him bite his
lip impatiently only seemed to accen-
tuate the firmness of his character

  now i am in trouble varron he
said after a short silence when my
car took a header into the lake out

there-

  great scott was that what it
did interrupted clay excitedly

  yes but thats nothing in itself
declared stanley hurriedly waving
aside further ejaculations what
troubles me is that twenty thousand
dollars in bills which were tied up in
a package and placed in one of the door
pockets of the car went down with
it

  good heavens

  i dare say the money is still in the
door pocket continued stanley but
what use is that when the car is at the
bottom of the lake it is between fifty
and sixty feet deep right off the edge
of the promenade in front of this
hotel

so ive heard but that isnt deep
enough to lose your car for you i see
they are working at it now look 
clay varron pointed out of the win-
dow and they saw that twenty or thirty

men were manipulating ropes that
dropped into the water they were
pulling at them with a big motor truck
as well as several teams of horses evi-
dently the crowd had something at-
tached to the ropes under water which
was giving the motor truck and horses
all the- could do to drag it out

  thats good  exclaimed stanley t
didnt think they would get at it so
soon ah  i see karl is out there
directing things that young fellow is
a wonder clay lets go out

  it was just as clay varron and stan-
ley downs reached the veranda that the
big archimedes motor car was drawn
to the surface of the lake and thence
to the boat landing which was almost
level with the top of the water

  stanley rushed down the steps and
laid his hand on the door pocket it
was in full view as the car lay on its
side

  the next moment he gave vent to a
groan of dismay

  the door pocket was empty

chapter iii

an enemy by chance

frantically stanley downs
searched all over the interior of
the big car it did not seem to
be much damaged although it was
soaked with water and showed mud
where it had struck the bottom of the
lake

  there were no signs of the packet
of money the door pocket seemed to
have been wrenched open and it was
easy to imagine that the money might
have slipped out as the machine tum-
bled over

  for a few moments stanley could
hardly realize the full extent of his mis-
fortune he soon made sure that the
package was not lying anywhere in the
car karl too searched carefully
without result

  get the car to the road as soon as


wide-awake magazine

you can karl directed stanley forc-
ing himself to speak calmly then
run it into the garage and overhaul it
we shall probably go on to new york
to-day

  very well sir

  how about the other car the fan-
chon are they -going to get it up
without much trouble

  i think so replied karl but it
was underneath our car and it may
take all day im afraid there isnt
much left of the fanchon bits of it
are floating on the water you can see
some of the wooden spokes of the
wheels and one of the mud guards came
up on the grappling irons a while ago
my poor car exclaimed a sweet
voice behind them you really think
it is done for then

  why helen cried clay varron
swinging around were you driving
that fanchon what the deuce made
you do it  i have often heard your fa-
ther tell you that you must never drive
a new car until he has tested it thor-
oughly himself

  well i tested this one for him
laughed helen ranfelt i dont think
he will have any more trouble with it
if it had not been for this gentleman
smiling at stanley he might not have
had any more trouble with his daughter
either

  it was a perilous proceeding all
around said stanley but i am re-
lieved to see that it had  serious out-
come-except for the car by the way
clay he went on turning to varron
perhaps you wont mind vouching for
me as a respectable member of society

to miss-

  what never been introduced
cried clay astonished well well
this is mr stanley downs of new
york-miss helen ranfelt you know
her father l k ranfelt-stanley by
name at least there is their home
up there on the mountain you can

just see it through the foliage-that
white house with the golden cupola
of course i have heard of mr ran-
felt returned stanley when he had ac-
knowledged the introduction with a
bow and had absorbed a most fascinat-
ing smile from the young lady who

has not his mines in nevada-

  oh yes broke in helen ranfelt
that is always the way everybody
has heard that dad has made many mil-
lions out of his mines and that they
are still producing but hardly any one
knows that he would be a great man
even if he had never got to be a mil-
lionaire you ought to see him drive
a fanchon mr downs-or any other
car no fear of his driving into a lake
he makes a car do just what he likes
and it is the same with everything else
he does

  clay varron smiled approvingly
thats so helen hes a mighty
smart man and ill say it even though
he is my uncle by the way now that
ive met you i guess ill drive you home
-if you want to go i havent seen
uncle larry for more than a year

  i heard that youve lost something
from your car mr downs said
helen some money dont you think
you can recover it

  im afraid not was the doleful re-
ply the lake is fifty feet deep right
here and much more as it approaches
the center it was a bundle of bank
notes wrapped up in paper the water
would destroy them in a very short
time and there is little chance of dredg-
ing up the fragments no im afraid it
is a dead loss

  i am very sorry

  her feminine tact told her it would
be better to say nothing more about it
the square jaw of stanley downs as
well as the fighting glint in his gray
eyes suggested that he would deal with
the misfortune in his own way and
that he would not ask for sympathy
from any one
the speedway of fate



  i shall have to communicate with
my uncle mr burwin in new york
he remarked after a short pause dur-
ing which it struck him that lie should
make some acknowledgment of her ex-
pression of sorrow the money was
his and i was taking it to our bank
burwin  son you know helen
interjected varron

  i did think i would go directly to
new york continued stanley but
i think i will call him up on long dis-
tance and stay here till i find out
whether i can save any of the bills
nothing much can be done to-day
i should say observed varron you
will have to get dredging machinery
from somewhere-poughkeepsie prob-
ably that will take at least twenty-
four hours by the time it is all set
up

  wont you be my fathers guest for
to-night mr downs asked helen
he will be pleased to see you es-
pecially when he hears that you have
saved his daughters life i am a great
deal of a nuisance to him but he thinks
something of me nevertheless

  well i should say he does laughed
clay varron helen makes him do
just what she wants i dont think any-
body else on earth could do that
the end of it all was that stanley
downs accepted helen ranfelts invi-
tation and about six oclock that even-
ing clay varron drove his big car un-
der the porte-cochere of lawrence k
ranfelts castlelike mansion on a raoun-
taintop to let stanley jump down to
help out the young girl who had been
by his side during the ride up from the
lake the glimmer of which could be
made out miles below

  karl had been instructed to watch
the attempts to get the package of bills
from the water and to let stanley know
by telephone if there should be any re-
sult the stolid chauffeur could be de-
pended on his faithfulness had been

proved in years of service and his hon-
esty was beyond question

  under the influence of a good din-
ner and cheerful conversation stanley
was able to look upon his heavy loss
with a more hopeful eye afterward

  lawrence k ranfelt was a man of
fifty or thereabouts with a jolly man-
ner a clean-cut shaven face and grip
when he shook hands that conveyed sin-
cerity that won stanleys confidence at
once

  what particularly pleased stanley
downs was that his host did not say
much about the part stanley had taken
in saving his daughter from death all
he did was to shake the young mans
hand and whisper after a ten minutes
talk alone with his daughter

  helen has told me mr downs 
thank you from the bottom of my heart
that sounds stupidly inadequate but i
mean it she says that if you had not
dragged her from the car down there
at the bottom of the lake she must have
been drowned you had opened the
door before the accident so that she
could get out that was something
everybody might not have thought of
but even then she would have died if
it had not been for what you did after-
ward

  this was just before dinner after
stanley had put on evening clothes
from clay varrons rather extensive
wardrobe and when the men were in
the library waiting for the call

  by the way mr downs you have
not met mr burnham-victor burn-
ham added ranfelt as a tall lean
man who might have been any age be-
tween thirty and fifty but who really
was thirty-five slipped into the library
burnham has been associated with tne
in the west for years lie was my su-
perintendent when i made my first good
strike and he is still looking out for the
ranfelt interests in the west but he
is not a mere superintendent now his
holdings in nevada mines have made

him a millionaire several times over
at least thats what people say eh
burnham 

  victor burnham shrugged his shoul-
ders deprecatingly as he shook hands
with stanley in a rather grudging
fashion

  people say many things that would
be better unsaid he growled my
private affairs are my own

  lawrence k ranfelt turned away
with a careless laugh he knew the
saturnine disposition of his old-time as-
sistant and never took notice of his
surly manner but stanley downs de-
cided in his own mind that he didnt
like victor burnham

  they went in to dinner now and
stanley was seated by the side of
helen not only that but the young
lady gave him as much of her atten-
tion and conversation as she could
without being actually discourteous to
the other guests two handsome girls
her classmates at vassar were in the
dinner party

  it was evident that stanley had made
a good impression  miss ranfelt he
on his part thoroughly enjoyed him-
self he could flirt with a pretty girl
as well as the next one and helen ran-
felt was undeniably extremely pretty

  whats the matter with that fel-
low thought stanley once when he
happened to look across the table and
found burnham glowering at him
wonder if ive given offense to mr
burnham 

  the truth was that he had given of-
fense victor burnham had gone so
far as to tell l k ranfelt that he
would like to marry his daughter the
mine owners reply was that he could
not interfere with her desires in the
way of matrimony if helen wanted
to marry burnham why he would con-
sider it then for the present he had
nothing to say

  you give me permission to try for
her then burnham had said

  sure go in and win-if you can
i can trust helen to act according to
her conscience

  this conversation had taken place on
this very afternoon and burnham had
been trying to make up his mind when
he would speak to helen now in came
this young man from new york who
had the advantage of having rescued
her from death and it was evident that
the girl had eyes for nobody else burn-
ham felt that he had good reason for
glowering at stanley downs

  it was after dinner when the four
men were in the billiard room enjoy-
ing cigars and cigarettes before join-
ing the ladies in the drawing-room that
the subject of the big motor race came
up

  i am interested in it- remarked
ranfelt casually i have a few thou-
sand dollars invested and i certainly
mean to see it pulled off colonel
frank prentiss is an old friend of mine
and i have no doubt he will make it
a success i wish i could drive in the
race it would be an easy way of pick-
ing up twenty thousand dollars to say
nothing of the cup which is said to be
worth a thousand or so

 the lawrence cup murmured
stanley downs thoughtfully by the
way mr ranfelt who is offering the
cup do you know

  lawrence k ranfelt brushed the
question aside with a careless wave of
the hand as he let a column of cigar
smoke issue from his lips

  what does it matter who offers it
he demanded with a flush rather deeper
than his usual color on his cheeks while
his keen eyes danced with amusement
it will not belong to anybody until it
has been won for three years in suc-
cession on the prentiss speedway
burnham here thinks he can carry it
off for the first time

  ill try growled burnham as
for the person who offers it i dont
see any use in making a mystery of
the speedway of fate



that it will all come out later tt is
mr ranfelt who is giving it he uses
his first name lawrence instead of
his surname-thats all

  lawrence k ranfelt burst out into
his jolly laugh as he slapped burnham
on the shoulder

  yes thats true he admitted but
there is something else much more in-
teresting than the fact that i have hung
up the cup for competition that is
that helen has publicly announced-at
home of course-that she will think
the man who wins this cup the greatest
hero she knows

  indeed asked stanley laughing
that is enough to make anybody want
to be entered in the race the twenty
thousand dollars would be nothing in
comparison

  well i dont know declared ran-
felt more soberly thats a good sum
of money i have nothing to do with
the purse however the speedway
association through colonel frank
prentiss is offering that and the best
of the purse is that it belongs out and
out to the man who wins it he wont
have to go on driving in other races
year after year as he will to become the
permanent holder of the cup

  stanley downs did not reply but he
was thoughtful and when he reached
the drawing-room with the others he
had so little to say that helen ranfelt
obviously piqued was especially gra-
cious to victor burnham and hardly
noticed stanley at all

  i believe ill do it was what stan-
ley kept on repeating to himself

  he was saying it mentally when he
reached his bedroom a few hours later
and gazed out of the window at the long
winding road down the mountain

  seventy miles was clay varrons
record in a kronite car on that very
road below there he mused sev-
enty miles an hour on an ordinary road
with all the possibilities of loose stones
holes and other cars meeting him

what could a man do in a good car on
the prentiss speedway the record at
sheepshead bay is more than a hundred
and two for three hundred and fifty
miles he sighed dubiously thats
some traveling keeping it up for more
than three hours

  stanley downs went to bed

chapter iv
a way out

im sorry nothing has been found of
your money mr downs but to
be frank  dont see how they could
get it for you paper money was never
meant to be soaked in water and used
afterward the twenty thousand dol-
lars belonged to the bank i under-
stand

  it was lawrence k ranfelt talking
after breakfast the next morning he
and stanley both early risers sat on
the veranda and gazed across at the
fresh verdure of the hills and the slowly
rising mist from the great hollows
they were alone mr ran felts man-
ner was very serious

  the money had been colonel pren-
tiss answered stanley but of
course when it came into my hands as
a representative of burwin  sons
banks we were responsible for its
safety the loss will fall on the bank
i suppose burwin  son can stand
it

  naturally but that is not the point
my uncle richard burwin does not
believe in mistakes-or accidents he
holds that the first always imply negli-
gence and that accidents never hap-
pen when proper care is taken

  i dont agree with your uncle
snapped ranfelt it was not your
fault that you fell into the lake yester-
day if you hadnt been trying to keep
that harum-scarum girl of mine out of
mischief you would never have got into
trouble however we wont talx about
that what about your uncle


wide-awake magazine

  only that t feel as if i cannot tell
him i have lost twenty thousand dol-
lars of the banks money

  hm what are you going to do
about it

  i wont do anything for a few days
except to wire my uncle i will not be
in new york just yet he will know i
have some reason for delay

  wont think youve lost the money 
stanley downs winced at this blunt
suggestion

  it will never occur to him besides
i may find it before i have to tell him
anything about it i have not given up
hope yet the men are still dredging
the lake

  i am afraid there is little chance of
your getting the twenty thousand dol-
lars if you depend on its being fished
out of the lake declared lawrence
ranfelt shaking his head

  i think that too was stanleys un-
expected outburst i am not depend-
ing on that in this big motor race at
the prentiss speedway the money
prizes go to the drivers while the cup
will be awarded to the car i have been
asked to drive a thunderbolt car in
this race and have been considering it
for several days this decides me i
will drive in the race

  he got up as he said this stretching
his arms and expanding his chest as if
glad to have come to a conclusion on a
perplexing matter

  whats that almost shouted ran-
felt do you really mean it
indeed i do why not i can
drive and i want the money

  but entering the race does not in-
sure the money for you the million-
aire reminded him

  nothing is sure in sport any more
than in other things answered stan-
ley but if i dont enter i shall not
have even a fighting chance that is
what i want-a fighting chance at win-
ning twenty thousand dollars

  fine exclaimed l k ranfelt as

he took stanleys hand i am glad to
hear you say this it is the way to deal
with a difficult situation i wish you
luck although he added slowly per-
haps i ought not to wish you that if
i am to be consistent

  why not asked stanley in some
surprise

  because victor burnham is going
to drive in the race with a columbiad
replied ranfelt it is not generally
known but i knew it burnham drove
his trial two-mile dash two or three days
ago qualifying as an entrant he did
the two miles in a minute and a third
-rather less that gave him something
to spare if you are going to drive
you havent much time id advise
you to get to the track and try out
your car right away you were there
yesterday i understand

  yes i meant to take the money to
the bank in new york and then go
right back i promised to give the
thunderbolt owners my decision by
telegraph to-day can i telephone to
the telegraph office from here

  come into my private office i have
a phone there

  it took nearly ten minutes to get the
telegraph office fifteen miles away and
then stanley downs had to repeat his
message twice before the operator could
catch it and repeat it back for verifi-
cation

  yes thats right called out stan-
ley downs at last moussard automo-
bile co buffalo will drive your
thunderbolt car in lawrence cup race
next thursday coming to buffalo to-
morrow for trial stanley downs
get that

  there was a pause and stanley
downs turned from the table with a
smile as he hung up the transmitter
when he swung around he found him-
self facing helen ranfelt who was
panting with excitement and victor
burnham who scowled
the speedway of fate



  oh mr downs isnt that splen-
did cried helen 

  i dont know that it is said stan-
ley laughing except to me i like
driving fast and from all i can judge
there will be some rapid moving at the
prentiss speedway next thursday
you have to go not less than eighty-
five miles an hour to qualify grunted
burnham i suppose you know that
i have studied the conditions of the
race so often that i think i am familiar
with them all replied stanley as he
turned away

  helen ranfelt followed him out to
the veranda and took his arm

  mr downs she whispered and he
noted a tremble in her soft tones
yes

  victor burnham is a dangerous man
he has been annoying me for some
time although i never let dad know if
i had there would have been a dread-
ful scene pin sure because dad never
can control his temper now he is get-
ting worse he came to me this morn-
ing as soon as i was downstairs tell-
ing me he had something important to
say

  yes

  i could only tell him to say it for i
have never told him he must not speak
to me-although i should like to do so

  but if he annoys you- began

stanley

  i am afraid you dont understand
dad thinks he is a good business man
-and i suppose he is besides dad
says he is not a bad fellow at heart
thats the way he expresses it only
he is a little gruff dad says some of
the finest men alive are like that
stanley nodded without speaking
he had seen enough of the good-na-
tured easy-going lawrence ranfelt to
understand that the mine owner would
make excuses for anybody so long as
a fair outside was presented

  victor burnham has asked my fa-
ther if he may ask me to marry him

he says dad told him to go ahead if
i dont believe what he says i can ask
my father thats what mr burnham
told me to-day

  the cad

  he also said this morning that he
had been told that i would make a hero
of the man who won this motor race

  that was true wasnt it queried
stanley with a smile your father
told us that last night but i under-
stood you had said it only in a playful
way so that no decent man would take
it otherwise

  i believe i did say so-and indeed
i think it wonderfully brave for any
man to dash around a track at such an
awful speed you see i know some-
thing about fast driving i often go
along the road myself at a mile a min-
ute hut the worst of it all is that vic-
tor burnham pretends to believe that
what i said about regarding a man as
a hero means that i will say yes if
he asks me to marry him

  you mean if he wins the race
yes hut im afraid lie will you
know that he is to drive a columbiad
car and that thai car is regarded as the
most powerful and speediest machine
that ever has been produced every-
body is afraid of it

  i have heard that it is a good ma-
chine admitted stanley but until it
has been tried out in a real competition
with the best cars that can be brought
against it that is only talk no one
knows for certain what the columbiad
can do because it is a french machine
and has never been seen in action in
america except at the trial a few days
ago

  that was when mr burnham quali-
fied as a driver wasnt it

  yes he did his two miles in one
minute and twenty seconds pretty
good going but i believe  can beat
that in the thunderbolt

  i am so glad you are going to drive
mr downs  happened to hear what


wide-awake magazine

you were saying over the telephone just
now and i hope you will win
thanks

  oh it isnt only because i want you
to be successful she confessed with
the candor that she inherited from her
plainspoken father i want you to
beat mr burnham

  and all the others in the race too
eh he rejoined with a humorous
curling of the lip he wont be the
only other driver you know miss ran-
felt

  he will be your chief competitor i
am afraid if you beat him you will
win i feel sure of that

  possibly assented stanley downs
thoughtfully it is said this colum-
biad is a terror i suppose burnham
is a good driver

  one of the best in the country dad
says hes cool strong and he has 
nerves dad has told me of the way
he held his own against some of the
rough men at the mines in days gone
by it is because he is so brave and
powerful that dad likes him i think
well ill try to beat him smiled
stanley

  you must do it she whispered
tensely if he should win this race i
would be afraid of him he would

come to me and-and-

  marry you by force hardly that
i think we dont do that kind of
thing nowadays besides your father
can take care of you why should you
fear this fellow

  i dont know why i should but i
do she confessed he has a way of
carrying things before him in a savage
way that gets him what he wants if
you beat him he will not have an ex-
cuse to annoy me

  stanley was rather astonished that
this plucky young girl should show so
much terror he had seen her driving
her big car down the winding road
showing no actual fear even when it
was inevitable that she should plunge

into the lake yet now as she talked
of this victor burnham she trembled
so that she could hardly stand and her
voice quivered pitifully

  ill take care of mr burnham both
on the track and elsewhere if it should
be necessary stanley assured her

  hardly were the words out of his
mouth when a footstep close by made
him turn he looked straight into the
malevolent eyes of the man he had been
talking about

  for a moment the two gazed at each
other defiantly then without speak-
ing victor burnham turned on his heel
and went into the house

  he heard you i am afraid mur-
mured the girl

  just as well if he did replied
stanley with a smile he will know
what to expect if he doesnt behave him-
self

  hello stan broke in the cheery
tones of clay varron ive just heard
the news

  what cried stanley half hoping
that the news might be good for him
they havent found the money in the
lake have they

  no old man i wish it was that
what i meant was that im pleased you
are going to be in that race mr ran-
felt and i are going to buffalo with
you we want to see you do your trial
you dont mind do you

  mind ejaculated stanley it is
the very thing i should have suggested
if i had thought you and mr ranfelt
would consent

  and im going too put in helen
decidedly

  so will i if i may be permitted
added the surly voice of victor burn-
ham as he stepped forward im told
the thunderbolt racer the company has
ready is quite a traveler i should like
to see how you will handle it

  i will drive you over in my car
stan if you like said clay ignoring
burnham mr ranfelt says he will
the speedway of fate



go in his own car and i suppose he
will take helen with him

  nobody asked victor burnham how
he intended to go but helen knew he
had come from buffalo in his own car
and of course he could go the same
way

  will you take me with you ran-
felt  he asked as the mine owner
stepped out to the veranda

  helen managed to catch her fathers
eye and he gave burnham a prompt
negative

  all right ranfelt i can drive my
own car he said with an evil grin
it will be a little lonely for me but
we can all go together even if we are
in separate cars

  the blackguard thought stanley
downs i feel as if he and i would
come to grips some time-and not on
the speedway only

chapter v

for a sure thing

it was two days later when victor
burnham with a raincoat covering
his ordinary raiment and a peaked
cap pulled well down over his brows
stood behind a big racing car in a ga-
rage in a back street in buffalo with
him was a man whose oily overalls and
blackened hands proclaimed him a ga-
rage employee

  now dan whispered burnham as
he glanced about to make sure they
could not be overheard you under-
stand that if i win this race you get a
clear thousand dollars

  when do i get it inquired dan
coldly i want it as soon as you run
your car off the track

  dan saltus youre just as suspi-
cious now as you ever were said
burnham grinning in a mirthless way
when you were engineer for me out
in nevada i knew that you did not
trust anybody-not even your best
friend

  best friend eh snorted mr sal-
tus passing a grimy hand across his al-
most as grimy face meaning your-
self i suppose

  meaning myself assented burn-
ham i was your best friend and i
am now you would not have this
nice little job as foreman of this
garage if i hadnt got it for you
thats right although i dont
know that it is such a nice little job at
that the men i have around me are
all dubs and if i want anything done
right i have to get at it myself but
never mind that drive ahead with
what you were going to say

  victor burnham stepped to the door
of the garage and looked up and down
the short street it was between six
and seven oclock in the evening after
general business hours and no one was
about the garage itself was empty
but for burnham and dan saltus the
foreman

  what i was going to say resumed
burnham as he stepped again to the
back of the racing car is that i have
to win this lawrence cup

  thats what theyll all say grunted
dan i mean all the drivers
possibly but its real business with
me ive got-to win 

  youll take a sporting chance i sup-
pose 

  no snarled burnham i wont-
if i can help it this lias to be a sure
thing for me chance wont do

  dan saltus took up some cotton
waste and wiped away a streak of black
oil he had just observed on one of the
brake rods of the gray racer it en-
abled him to avoid a response

  this car is better than anything to
be driven in that race-except one
the thunderbolt

  yes

  i see but what are you going to
do about it

  victor burnham glanced furtively
about him then he moved close to


wide-awake magazine

the grimy mechanic still busy with his
waste and whispered in his ear

  what can you do about it

  i dont get you

  oh yes you do insisted burn-
ham but you dont want to admit
it youre not a bonehead exactly
thanks but youll have to come
across more plainly than this if you
want a straight answer from me de-
clared dan doggedly

  very well i will

  there was utter silence for perhaps
a quarter of a minute victor burn-
ham hardly knew how to frame in
words what he wanted to say like
most men of his type he was always
fearful of placing himself in the power
of anybody

  of course dan i know you are
straight with me im not afraid of
your giving any of this conversation
away even if you did it would not
make any difference no one would
believe you

  no one would have to retorted
dan i dont talk about my private
business and this is plumb private
go on mr burnham you are so leery
of what you say that anybody would
think youre planning a murder whats
it all about

  if that thunderbolt had some little
thing the matter with it so that it did
not yield all the power it has generally
been able to deliver or so that it would
gradually give out-without danger to

the driver of course-

  nothing like that could happen with-
out danger to the driver threw in dan
when a car is going ninety or a hun-
dred miles an hour or even fifty there
is a chance of the drivers neck being
broken if anything slips you know
that mr burnham

  it does not always follow insisted
burnham especially when it is only
some little thing in every big race a
lot of cars draw out before the finish
with some small thing the matter

  what for instance growled dan
a flaw in a connecting rod engine
trouble of some kind carburetor not
working just right-any one of a dozen
things i leave it to you what to do
but i want the thunderbolt to come in
behind the columbiad i drive

  why cant you drive on the level
demanded dan sulkily you have a
car here that can walk away from any
of them i know ive driven it my-
self and i saw you in the trial why
you did your ninety miles and over-
that is an average of that-in your
trial and you had any amount of power
that you didnt call  why dont you
go into the race and trust to your ma-
chine thats what id do

  victor burnham ripped out an oath
in a low tone that made up in foulness
what it lacked in volume

  im not asking what youd do he
rasped i want you to do this thing
for me and ill pay you for doing it
you will give me the thousand you
promised if you win the race i agreed
to take that but it was only for seeing
that the machine was in perfect condi-
tion i didnt bargain for any real
crooked work for that money growled
dan

  it was understood

no it wasnt if you want anything
more than straight goods from me
youve got to hand over something more
than a thousand-a great deal more
ill give you another thousand
making two thousand altogether
yes

  ill do what you want me to but
-wait a moment one thousand will
have to be paid whether you win or
not im not taking all the chances
suppose i get at the thunderbolt and
im seen where would i come in  it
might take a thousand dollars for a
lawyer to clear me ive got to have a
thousand before ill take the contract
you know im square i wont take
your money and not do the job
the speedway of fate



  victor burnham reflected with deeply
contracted brows and as he did so any
casual observer would have said that
he was the very incarnation of evil in-
deed he might have been plotting mur-
der as dan saltus had intimated so
far as could be told from the expression
of his dark face

  heres the thousand dan he said
at last drawing a wallet from an inside
pocket do you promise to get at the
thunderbolt

  for a thousand dollars-yes re-
plied dan holding out his hand for the
money

  without speaking victor burnham
opened the wallet and counted ten hun-
dred-dollar bills into the garage fore-
mans hand

  id rather have had it in smaller
bills grumbled dan it isnt so easy
to get a century changed without people
wondering where you got it but i
dare say i can get away with it

  he rolled the money into a small
package and put it in a pocket under
his overalls looking at the racing car
before him as he did so

  this columbiad is in good shape i
suppose dan nothing hurt it in the
trial 

  not a thing i have been over it
carefully and taken a long time to do
it shes ready for the race this min-
ute if you wanted to take her out
ill be your mechanician of course-as
i was in the trial-and ill know that
shes tuned up to concert pitch when we
line up ive got plenty of gas in her
but ill draw it all out and put in fresh
gas before the race of course ive got
the very best grade of gasoline on the
market and ive strained it three times
already to make sure shes clean
victor burnham nodded perfuncto-
rily at all this he knew dan saltus
would look after all details gasoline
water oil and every part of the ugly
gray machine with its great white fig-
ure  painted on it in several places
a

would be exactly right that was not
what he had to think about

  what troubled him was that the
thunderbolt-a wonderful racer that
never had been beaten by an american
car so far-would also be in perfect
condition with everything else equal
he feared that stanley downs could
push ahead of the columbiad

  i dont know that he could do it
muttered burnham half aloud but
he might thats what has to be pre-
vented

  ill prevent it all right declared
dan who had overheard do you
want to look her over any more if
you dont ill take her to the storeroom
and lock her in

  ive seen enough of her replied
burnham take her up

  dan saltus dropped into the low
drivers seat-with its comfortable
cushions which gave just room for the
mechanician to sit by the side of the
driver-and skillfully guided the car
upon a flat platform elevator a few
yards away

  the smoothness with which the
powerful machine rolled along the con-
crete floor so slowly that it appeared
hardly to be moving proved that it was
a perfect bit of mechanism one could
hardly realize that its gaunt rakish
frame held the potency of a hundred
miles an hour and more it just crawled
now-no more

  victor burnham waited patiently un-
til dan saltus had taken the car to an
upper floor where it would be locked
up in an iron fireproof room by itself
when the foreman came down again
burnham remarked that the trial of the
thunderbolt was to take place at the
speedway at ten the next morning

  i know it replied dan

  youll be there

  i guess so the boss here doesnt
like me to be away too much for we
are pretty busy but i can trust my
assistant for that length of time we


wide-awake magazine

have some good men working for us
too thats one comfort but you
dont want me to do any work on the
thunderbolt to-morrow do you he
added with the ghost of a grin

  no growled burnham so long
as you are on the job when the race
comes off i dont ask anything more
but i want you to see this thunderbolt
in real action at the trial it may give
you some ideas as to how you are to
fix it afterward good night dan
he walked out of the garage without
looking back outside he lighted a
cigar which he puffed contentedly as
he went along

  the coldest proposition i ever went
up against reflected dan saltus aloud
looking after the departing burnham
by gravy i believe hed rather have
that young fellow downs killed than
not if burnham knew i was on to his
game to the very bottom hed be sur-
prised i reckon he thinks  think all
he cares about is to win this race just
for the sake of the glory and my thou-
sand dollars strange how things come
about if it hadnt been that hank
swartz is a friend of mine id never
have got on to it all as it is i reckon

that- hello hank where did

you blow in from

  a wide-shouldered lean-faced man
with the deep tan on his face that told
of outdoor life in the open country-
for he could not have got so brown
anywhere else-strolled into the garage
and coolly appropriated the one wooden
chair in sight which was usually occu-
pied by the foreman when he had noth-
ing else to do

chapter vi
the heart of the plot

i have been attending to affairs for
burnham replied hank swartz
when he was comfortably settled in
his chair i wish i could smoke in
here

  well you cant snapped dan
you know that as well as i do this
is a garage

  all right i just dropped in to see
how the columbiad looked where
is she

  shes put away upstairs in her own
little flat answered dan with his usual
surly grin we are not showing her
to everybody until the day of the race
then some of them may see her a little
too much shes going to win that cup
and the purse hank

  of course she is she must
therell be a neat little sum in side bets
too gee i reckon vic burnham will
clean up about fifty thousand well he
needs it

  this time dan saltus allowed him-
self to chuckle outright

  he sure does hes so near broke
that if he was to get a hard shove he
would tumble clear over into bank-
ruptcy but hes a great bluffer if he
can get that girl of ranfelts hell be
all right but the other string he has
out on old man burwin of burwin 
sons bank is a good one too

  and yet that deal depends rather
on this race for the lawrence cup just
as his winning helen ranfelt does
remarked hank swartz wisely

  how i dont quite get that re-
sponded dan saltus

  well you know that burnham
wants to get old dick burwin to open
a branch bank out in carson city and
appoint burnham the president
sure im wise to that

  well burnham has been bluffing the
old man that he can put a hundred
thousand plunks into the capital of the
new bank that would give an excuse
for making him president old burwin
likes the scheme according to burnham
but burnham has always been afraid
that when it was sprung on burwins
nephew this stanley downs the beans
would all be spilled

   reckon thats so agreed dan
the speedway of fate



thoughtfully this downs is one
smart guy they say his uncle relies
 his judgment in most everything he
does

  thats what was swartzs re-
sponse so its up to burnham to keep
it away from stanley downs-which
he has done up to date-or to queer
downs so badly with his uncle that any-
thing lie says wont count pretty slick
plan eh dan 

  the two men chuckled in concert
obviously they were both in a plot that
appealed to their peculiar temperament
and which it gave them pleasure to
discuss at their leisure

  i hear stanley downs has lost
twenty thousand dollars belonging to
the bank remarked dan after a short
pause

  oh you heard that eh where did
you get it

  oh come off hank what am i
 earth for to walk around with
plugs in my ears and blinders on i
can tell you something more about that
downs is keeping it from his uncle that
hes shy the twenty thousand and he
hopes to get it from this cup race isnt
that right

  you are not far off dan admitted
swartz

  you bet im not well he isnt
going to get that twenty thousand be-
cause burnham with his columbiad
upstairs will rush over the finish line
while stanley downs and his thunder-
bolt will be a hundred miles behind
wondering why he ever entered

  youll get some of the purse eh
dan

  ill be the mechanician of course
ill get some you dont think im
going to take chances of being all
broken up for nothing

  but wont you get more than your
mechanicians percentage persisted
swartz

  dan saltus had been leaning against
the doorpost where he could look up

and down the street while conversing
with swartz he swung around ab-
ruptly at the last remark and there was
an expression of anger as well as fear
in his eyres

  what do you mean by that hank 
who said id get more than my reg-
ular bit as a mechanician why
should i

  i dont know i only asked re-
plied hank swartz coolly im get-
ting paid by burnham for certain work
im doing for him i wouldnt tell
everybody but im not trying to hide
it from you i thought you might
loosen up a little to me-thats all
were old pards weve rode worked
and bunked together out in the west
both in the cattle country and the mines
but if you want to forget all that why
it goes with me too

  there was so much sadness in the
way this was said that dan saltus felt
obliged to respond he held out his
hand to the other

  i didnt mean nothing hank he
protested only it aint well to talk
too much ill only tell you this much
and you can guess the rest if you have
a mind to victor burnham is going
to win this race with the columbiad

  i see replied swartz im glad
to hear it that will make things all
o k for me at my end of it

  how 

  if burnham wins the race it will
put stanley downs in the wrong with
his uncle hell be twenty thousand
dollars shy for one thing and hell fall
down in a game that hes supposed to
know all the way through from soup
to nuts

  then theres ranfelts girl sug-
gested dan

  yes not that stanley downs wants
her he never met her till yesterday
when he played into our hands by div- 
ing into the lake with her and her
fanchon laughed hank but vic
burnham is crazy for her


wide-awake magazine

  what are you handing me hank
demanded saltus with an incredulous
chuckle i never knew vic burnham
to be crazy over any girl he wants her
dads money thats all

  well isnt it all the same rejoined
swartz he wants her and hell stand
a fair show of getting her if he pulls off
this race im mighty glad you and he
have it framed up to get it for him
there you go again hank com-
plained dan saltus who has any-
thing framed up its going to be a
straight contest with the best car and
driver winning you know that dont
you 

  of course i do you neednt fly
off the handle just because we are hav-
ing a little friendly talk im going
around to look at the thunderbolt if i
can its in the moussard garage
they are not letting strangers look her
over of course but i know the boys
there and i reckon i can get in to see
what she looks like at close range
hank swartz strolled out after a
friendly so long to dan and walked
across that part of the city for about a
quarter of a mile before he stopped in
front of another garage which was
enough like the one where he had left
dan saltus to be mistaken for it if it
had been next door

  it was in an upstairs warehouse that
swartz found several persons standing
around the racer that stanley downs
was to drive in the trial for two miles
on the morrow

  one of the garage men took swartz
up and directed him to stand out of
sight behind a big limousine until the
party looking at the thunderbolt went
away

  then you can give her the once over
without one knowing anything about
it said the man to swartz the boss
gave orders that nobody was to see it
except mr downs and his friends-and
mr ranfelt of course they are over
there now but they wont stay long

  all right bill returned swartz as
the two sat on the running board of the
limousine

  you will easily qualify at the trial
to-morrow mr downs remarked
helen ranfelt as stanley downs
pointed out to her the various items that
made up the big thunderbolt i know
something about automobiles and i can
see that you have about everything in
this car that you could want in a racer
how i should like to drive her over the
track myself just once she added
wistfully

  it wouldnt be as comfortable as
your fanchon helen put in her
father besides it isnt customary for
young ladies to drive in races

  i didnt say i wanted to drive in the
race pouted helen although i
wouldnt mind doing that if it were con-
sidered the proper thing what i sug-
gested was that it would be nice to
send the thunderbolt over that beau-
tiful smooth wooden floor of the speed-
way just to feel her going at ninety
miles an hour

  ninety miles an hour helen said
clay varron with a laugh you have
your nerve with you do you realize
that that means a mile and a half a
minute 

  i know the multiplication table
clay she rejoined if it is the mul-
tiplication table you compute it by
anyhow i have driven sixty miles on
a road and i dont think speed would
ever scare me very badly

  thats so agreed lawrence k
ranfelt boisterously by george
clay id rather trust helen in a race
than a lot of men  know id like to
see her in a car against victor burn-
ham i bet shed make vic hustle
helen ranfelt frowned and pinched
her fathers arm

  was it necessary to bring mr burn-
hams name into this she asked in a
whisper i want to forget him

  if you do youd better root for mr
the speedway of fate



downs to pull off the race you know
what burnham expects if he brings the
columbiad in first

  what he expects and what he will
get may be widely apart dad returned
the girl in her usual tone and with a
careless laugh and toss of her head
anyhow im expecting to see the
thunderbolt do it easily

  we shall get a line on it at the trial
to-morrow observed varron i sup-
pose you havent any doubt about it
yourself-have you stan

  stanley downs smiled as he patted
the gray monster with its immense
white  on the front of the radiator
and repeated in three other places on
each side of the hood and at the back

  im ready to guarantee that the
thunderbolt is in perfect condition to-
night he said that means it will be
the same in the morning for it will be
shut up here by the garage men after
weve gone and  one else will see it
till i come down here to drive it to the
speedway

  youll drive it through the city your-
self then asked varron

  certainly it is the safest thing
to do

  plow do you feel yourself asked
jir ranfelt slapping him on the shoul-
der think you are fit

  seem to be replied stanley as the
party filed out of the room and went
down the stairs on their way to the
street

  now hank said the man he had
called bill if you want to take a
flash at the thunderbolt now is your
time

  hank swartz walked over to the
racer over which a bunch of electric
lights still glowed and bent down to
look at her closely

  this man had owned several cars in
his life and he knew the points of an
automobile so his examination of the
thunderbolt was an intelligent one
even though he was not long making it

  well queried bill as swartz at
last moved away from the thunder-
bolt what do you think of her
hank swartz drew a long breath
then he shook his head slowly

  she is unbeatable-as she stands
to-night he answered

  he went out of the garage boarded
a street car at a near corner and sent
his name up to a certain room in a
prominent hotel

  mr burnham is out announced lie
clerk when the telephone had failed
to draw a response from the room

  swartz frowned impatiently then
he hastily wrote his name  a card and
handed it to the clerk on the card he
had also written call me up right
away important trouble

  see that mr burnham gets this card
as soon as he returns please he re-
quested as he turned away from the
desk

  he strode up and down the spacious
lobby several times thinking and mut-
tering to himself what he said was
the thunderbolt is unbeatable i said
it and i sincercly meant it unbeatable

-unless-- well that will be up to

burnham

  he walked out of the hotel still
thinking and muttering

        chapter vii
        a reply by wire

the trial of the thunderbolt was
an entire success as stanley
downs had said the car was
tuned to perfection while he the
driver was as good as his machine the
two worked together like one organism

  there were several hundred people
at the speedway to see the trial al-
though it was not a public exhibition
the spectators included drivers of other
cars mechanicians officers of the
speedway-including the manager


wide-awake magazine

colonel frank prentiss-and other per-
sons who were connected in various
ways with the track and the race that
was to take place on thursday

  stanley did not push his car too hard
but he went over the two miles in a min-
ute and twenty seconds which was at
the rate of ninety miles an hour this
admitted the car to the cup race the re-
quirement being a speed of not less than
eighty-five miles an hour

  when the trial was over and as soon
as he could get away from the swarm
of interested people who crowded about
the car after it had passed the judges
stand and been declared qualified stan-
ley left the track and made his way to
the garage where he turned the thun-
derbolt over to his mechanician

  he had had a telegram from his uncle
that morning which he should have an-
swered before-only that he did not
know what to say it disturbed him so
that it was only by desperately concen-
trating his mind on the business imme-
diately in hand that he had been en-
abled to drive in the trial

  the telegram was brief and to the
point it read as follows

  have heard that you met with accident in
mountains not far from poughkeepsie is
money safe answer at once

richard burwin

  what shall i do about this clay
asked stanley of his friend as the two
pored over the telegram in stanleys
room at the hotel the money is at
the bottom of the lake i suppose it is
safe enough but i havent got it he
added grimly

  i suppose you must answer the
wire observed varron with a ques-
tioning look

  if you knew my uncle as well as i
do returned stanley you would not
ask that of course i must answer it

  w ell then id give him the answer
you just now gave me

  stanley looked at him puzzled for

a moment then he uttered a short
laugh and shook his head

  you mean that i shall telegraph him
the money is safe

  just that replied clay varron
you said yourself it was safe that is
what he asks

  that would be a prevarication i
dont see how i can say that he
wouldnt consider it safe if i told him
where it was no clay i cant do it
my uncle is always square with me i
should feel like a crook if i sent him
such a message as that

  well what will you do  if you tell
him the truth what will be the conse-
quence 

  the consequence will be that he will
think i am a fool answered stanley
downs without hesitation

  he couldnt think that unless hes
a fool himself was clays warm re-
joinder come again

  well he would know that i had
failed in a matter where i should have
used extreme care and i doubt whether
he ever would trust me again i have
fallen down and there is no getting
away from it

  stanley downs strode up and down
the room in such a dejected frame of
mind that his friend became indignant

  whats the matter with you stan
buck up you took a risk of your
life to save a girl and you did what any
man ought to do the fact that some
of them would have held back is noth-
ing to do with the case when you
knew that that crazy kid cousin of mine
was driving straight to a horrible death
you followed her up and brought her
through if you call that falling down
or behaving like a fool then i can only
say  wish there were more fools like
you in the world

  stanley downs placed his two hands
affectionately on the shoulders of his
loyal friend and looked him in the eyes
as he asked earnestly

  clay now on the level would you
the speedway of fate



ask me to tell a deliberate lie to my
uncle who has always been straight
with me-who has been indeed more
than a father-and who would fight
any man who dared even to hint that
i would juggle with the truth would
you 

  clay varron coughed in embarrass-
ment then he answered in as earnest
a voice as stanleys own

  of course you cant do it stan but
 dont know what to advise you to tele-
graph him  dont by gosh

  there is only one way out of it that
i can see declared stanley after a
few minutes cogitation that is to
evade his question for the present i
am in hopes that after thursday i shall
be able to go to new york with the
money

  you will old man was clays
eager response youll win that race
and have twenty thousand dollars to
replace what yrou have lost i am sure
of that i believed it before  saw the
trial to-day now  know there is noth-
ing can beat the thunderbolt with you
at the wheel this columbiad may be
a good car i believe it is but the
cars being equal-and i have no idea
that the columbiad is better than the
thunderbolt you are a better driver
than burnham that will give you just
the edge you require to come in first
your judgment in driving will beat
burnham as sure as that the sun will
rise to-morrow morning

  there was no resisting the enthusi-
asm of clay varron a smile broke
over stanleys troubled countenance
and it was with a feeling of confidence
that he took up a pad of telegraph
blanks from a table to write a message
to richard burwin

  lie was some little time composing
the telegram at last however he had
written what he thought would be the
best thing and he read it to clay in
the following words

     am detained in buffalo until after the au-
  tomobile race on thursday have business
  with colonel prentiss will come to new
  york on friday all well

stanley downs

    that all well is a good touch
  approved clay varron it is the truth
  too when you have driven this race
  everything will be well and you will go
  down to new york with your twenty
  thousand dollars then you can tell
  your uncle about it if you like

    i certainly shall tell him i am in
  hopes that if there is no loss he will

 forgive me-

   for taking a chance on being
 drowned to save a girl eh interrupted
 clay well if he doesnt forgive you
 he will have a hard time explaining to
 his conscience going to take that tele-
 gram downstairs and have it sent or
 will you telephone for a boy to be sent
 here asked clay

    i think ill walk around with it to
  the office then i shall know it gets off
  right away decided stanley will
  you dine with me to-night

    cant dear boy answered clay
  ive promised to take dinner with the
  ranfelts at their hotel then we are
  going to a theater by the way you
  were invited too-werent you

   yes but i begged off i knew
 this telegram was here and to tell the
 truth i didnt feel like talking and
 seeing a show there are only two
 more clear days before the race and i
 think i shall use them in resting except
 when i am exercising the thunderbolt
 on the speedway i want to get used
 to that track

   there is not much to be learned
 about it i should think said vernon
 it is almost a counterpart of the
 speedway at sheepshead two-mile
 oval with two half-mile straightaways
 and two half-mile turns

yes i know all that interrupted
stanley and at the curves the out-
 side edges rise to twenty-five feet the


wide-awake -a ia gazin e

track is seventy feet wide you see
i have all its dimensions i even know
that it is built of two-by-four pine laid
on edge but all that means little to a
man in a big race unless he has prac-
ticed again and again no matter how
smooth a track may seem to be there
are sure to be little kinks that a driver
should know

  in what way are there kinks
little waves where the going rises
slightly-almost imperceptibly-and yet
which will make a fast-running car
swerve you know that clay you
are an automobilist

  clay varron nodded he did in-
deed understand how slight an obstruc-
tion will change the course of a motor
car when going at high speed there
could be no argument as to the wisdom
of a driver trying out the track as often
as possible

  of course stan it would be foolish
in you to neglect all possible precau-
tions so i suppose it was wise for you
to pass up this dinner-and-show game
to-night therell be supper after the
theater of course and i dare say it will
be two oclock in the morning if not
later before the fair-haired boy who
is talking to you will sink upon his
downy pillow

  drivers in three-hundred-and-fifty-
mile cup races should not stay up till
two in the morning said stanley with
a laugh so i have plenty of excuse
for not being with you to-night
another thing stan that might
have decided you to remain away is
that victor burnham will be in the
party i dont believe you like him any
more than i do besides he will be
your principal opponent in the race i
think and you wouldnt want to talk
about it i know

  but he would i guess

 sure hes just the kind of
bounder who would try to get your goat
by talking about the difficulties of the

thing and wondering whether your car
will stand the racket

  that would be very unsportsman-
like remarked stanley with a shrug

  of course thats why burnham
would do it hes a scalawag through
and through stan i know that ive
met him before and i tell you old
man when you are in the race you
want to look out for him if there is
anything he can do to foul you thats
what hell do

  stanley downs laughed disdainfully
there isnt much chance of a driver
fouling another in an automobile race
without his risking his own neck as
well as the other fellows clay i can
take care of myself when once w are
going

   reckon so agreed clay varron
well ill walk with you as far as the
telegraph office well take those back
streets they are a short cut you
know the way dont you

  of course i do come on

  the two young men walked briskly
from the hotel and in ten minutes stan-
ley was handing in his telegram telling
the clerk to send an answer if there
should be one to the hotel

  clay varron had left his friend at
the door of the telegraph office and
was on his way to his room to dress
for the dinner to which he had been
invited

  when the message had been filed and
paid for stanley came out alone and
strolled along busy main street for
several blocks thinking of the strange
curve of the ball of fate that had
brought him to buffalo again to be-
come a driver in this great race

  if i werent so worried about that
money i should enjoy the experience
just for itself he murmured as it
is i am so anxious to win that it may
be tne cause of my defeat defeat
no sir i must win

  he was so taken up with his thoughts
that he never noticed two rather under-
the speedway of fate



sized youths with the furtive air and in
the flashily cut cheap clothing peculiar
to the underworld class known as
gangsters in most large american
cities who kept always at the same
short distance behind him and who
never let him out of their sight

chapter viii

desperate treachery

it was when stanley had turned off
the main thoroughfare with its
electric lights and thronging prom-
enaders into a labyrinth of dark and
small streets that he realized he had
lost his way

  he could have turned around and
come back to the broad well-lighted
avenue he had just left but that was
not stanley downs way for he rather
enjoyed wandering about cities without
any clear notion of where he was going
only to find himself at last on some
familiar thoroughfare

  i have nothing particular to do this
evening he told himself i dont
think i want any regular dinner and i
shall go to bed after a while so i
will just keep going till i come out
somewhere i know

  he strolled through the dark streets
for another ten minutes without com-
ing to any landmark he recognized al-
ways behind him crept the shadows of
the two gangsters and both held in
their hands short clubs of some kind

  ah i see bright lights at the end
of this street at last muttered stan-
ley i knew id work out of this
muddle sooner or later glad of it
for this darkness and the rough side-
walks are getting monotonous

  pie had stood at the mouth of a dark
and forbidding alleyway as he gazed at
the reflection of the lights some three
blocks ahead

  he laughed at himself for being lost
in a city that he knew fairly well and
had started to walk on when a soft

shuffling sound behind made him swing
around with an instinctive feeling that
he must protect himself from some sud-
den danger

  it was this instinct that caused him
to raise both arms in an attitude of
defense also it prevented his being
struck on the head

  a blackjack came down rather hard
on his left arm while another weapon
of the same kind which menaced him
on the right called for immediate action

  stanley downs was used to fighting
in all sorts of ways not only was he a
finished scientific boxer but he had had
experience in the brutal pastime of
rough and tumble many times

  down went the gangster who was
about to bring the loaded club on him
on his right stanley hit clean and true
his fist caught the fellow under the
chin and sent him flying backward until
he tumbled against a wall where he
stood gasping

  the other rascal having seen that his
handy billy had not injured the arm
it had struck gathered himself together
and disappeared in the darkness with
the celerity that told of his familiarty
with the locality as well as proving that
he was a lively sprinter

  stanley turned to look at the half-
disabled ruffian who was leaning against
the wall but hardly had he got his
eyes focused on the limp figure when
the gangster by a powerful effort of
will slunk out of view also

  where he went was not apparent
there were many holes and corners in
that shady neighborhood including
doorways to houses which were like rat
burrows to those who knew them

  let him go muttered stanley
smiling he hasnt done me any harm
and i could not bother to have him ar-
rested even if there were a policeman
in sight i suppose they were just com-
mon holdups if one of them had
landed on my head with a blackjack or
sandbag they might have get me too
 g

wide-awake magazine

as it was they dont win ill get to
the lighted streets however i couldnt
afford to be knocked out a day or so
before that big race after that it
wouldnt so much matter

  he laughed aloud at the incident
which had ended in what he regarded
as rather a ludicrous manner and went
calmly back to his hotel and soon after-
ward to bed

  about the time that stanley downs
was undressing and thinking over the
big contest in which he was to take
part on the day after the morrow vic-
tor burnham sat in the back room of a
low saloon in a tough part of the city
talking to the two gangsters who had
vainly endeavored to knock stanley
senseless

  he spoiled it did he grunted
burnham that shows that you fel-
lows are not much good i ought not
to pay you what youve done for me
is just nothing

  we couldnt help it snarled one
of the ruffians we shadowed him for
nearly an hour before we got a chance
then somebody must have given him a
tip for he turned just as i landed on
him with the billy i got him on the
arm insteadof the head he didnt
pay no attention to me but he cut loose
a left hook that took patsy in the jaw
and laid him out stiff i beat it of
course there wasnt nothing else to
do later i met patsy here and here
he is hell tell you whether im lying
or not

  i dont suppose youre lying inter-
rupted burnham disgustedly i only
say you are  good but here is your
fifty dollars if you can get him again
before the race ill make it a hundred
more-a hundred apiece if he doesnt
show up in the race ill know that
youve done it and youll get your
money right away

  he hurried out of the saloon patsy
and the other worthy ordered more

beer and divided the money burnham
had paid

  what do you say patsy asked
his pal want to go after that duck
again for a hundred

  not on your life returned patsy
fervently i wouldnt tackle him for
five hundred

  and patsy meant it

  it was in the forenoon of the next
day that stanley downs again tried out
the car he was to use in the race by
his side was the taciturn efficient young
man who had been offered to him by
the moussard company as his mech-
anician

  the mechanician often is as im-
portant a personage in a racing car as
the driver at any moment during the
race the machine may develop some
weakness and it is the mechanician who
immediately jumps in to get things
going again at a time when every sec-
ond counts the ability of the mech-
anician to work swiftly very often wins
the struggle

  stanley was entirely satisfied with the
performance of the thunderbolt and
was smiling as he got out of his seat
in the garage after the trial on the
track

  paul he said to the mechanician
you might as well look things over
again and perhaps it would be well
if you got around very early in the
morning to make sure that everything
is right the other men here are all
safe of course or the moussard people
wouldnt have them but i believe in
seeing for myself that my machine is
right before it starts

  ill do it sir replied paul briefly
ill have the car in good shape but
i would advise that you look her over
yourself afterward

  i shall do that of course paul
returned stanley im going to the
hotel to rest most of the day if you
want me you can call me up there

  it was not more than two hours later
the speedway of fate



when there came a banging at stanleys
door accompanied by the voice of clay
varron calling to him to open

  whats the matter clay any-
thing happened  my uncle anything
from him

  no i havent heard from him
how should i  he wouldnt write or
telegraph me would he no its
something else paul wallman your
mechanician is in the hospital

  what cried stanley realizing
with a rush what this might mean to
him in the race hurt sick
badly smashed by a car it hap-
pened in the garage he was bending
down by the side of your thunderbolt
another man handling cars up there
didnt see him and shoved a big car
against him crushing him against an
iron post he dropped in a heap and
they hurried him off to the hospital
his right arm is broken and they were
afraid of internal injuries but i hear
there is nothing of that kind his
broken arm puts him out of the race
with you however

   what am i to do exclaimed stan-
ley downs knitting his brows this
is a serious matter it may mean that
i shall be hopelessly beaten poor
paul im sorry for him too what
shall i do ill have to get another
mechanician but good ones are scarce
i cant afford to risk the race with one

i dont know at the same time-

   look here stan broke in varron
i didnt come here to bring bad news
without having something to suggest
what is it clay questioned stan-
ley as he clapped a hand on his friends
shoulder i suppose you have found
a good man for me-as good a one as
paul wallman

   i dont know about that was the
modest response the man i have for
you is myself

   yourself

  yes i know the thunderbolt car
pretty well ive driven one for a con-

 siderable time at intervals and i dont
 think there are any thunderbolt tricks
 that can fool me aside from that you
 know that if there is anything the
 mechanician can do to take you over
 the finish line first your humble servant
 will do it is it a go 

  the hearty handshake and the ex-
pression of gratitude in stanley downs
face was answer enough

  all right then went on varron
hurriedly lets get dowrn to the ga-
rage and look the machine over then
we might as well take a spin around
the track together what do you say 
they hurried to the garage and soon
had the big racer on the street ready
to start for the speedway out in the
country among those who watched
stanley downs drive away with his
new mechanician was hank swartz
he was frowning heavily

  i dont know how it is muttered
hank to himself but that downs al-
ways seems to fall on his feet what
was the use of paying to have paul
knocked out when he can get as good
a man as clay varron to fill his place
i know varron id rather have him in
that thunderbolt than paul wallman
any time burnham will get the worst
of this yet if he doesnt watch out

       chapter ix
       a broken record

it was a splendid day for the big race
there was not too much sun for a
soft mist hung in the air tempering
the light but it was bright and com-
fortably warm nevertheless in a
word it was perfect spring weather

  the grand stand bleachers and
every other part of the immense
grounds where admission was charged
were crowded with sight-seers in the
vast acreage around the track set apart
for automobiles the machines were
parked several deep and in all of them
were groups of well-dressed men and


wide-awake magazine

beautifully dressed women who had
come from all parts of the country to
see what could be done by motor cars
that were the last word in scientific
achievement

  there was a record already of more
than a hundred and two miles an hour
by an american car would this be
beaten to-day that was the question
or would it ever be equaled

  that columbiad may do it ob-
served colonel frank prentiss to a few
of his intimates as he stood in the
judges stand and looked over thevast
crowd that had gathered in the hope of
seeing a smashed record there is a
possibility that the thunderbolt may
touch it too

  id like to see the thunderbolt win
remarked an elderly man with the in-
describable air of wealth about him that
can seldom be mistaken it is an
american car the columbiad is of
foreign make i believe

  yes replied lawrence k ranfelt
who had brought this gentleman into
the stand as a special favor it is
driven by an american however vic-
tor burnham ever heard of him
yes ive heard of him replied the
other dryly i guess ill get down to
my car i can see the race from there
comfortably come with me ranfelt
yes i believe i will replied law-
rence k as he went down the spiral
staircase with -the elderly gentleman
my girl helen is with a party of
friends in another car

  the preliminaries of the big race
were carried out rapidly and in busi-
nesslike fashion

  the drivers and mechanicians had
looked their machines over for the last
time had given them little dashes over
the track to make sure that everything
worked easily and now were lining up
across the wide speedway to have their
photographs taken cn masse

  it was difficult to tell one from the
other at a little distance they all

looked like machinists in very soiled
clothing while the tight caps goggles
in front and the coat collars pulled up
high helped to hide the fact that many
of the contestants were extremely per-
sonable young men who in their street
clothing were rather finicky about their
appearance

  stanley downs and clay varron
stood side by side and close by were
victor burnham with his mechanician
dan saltus stanley and burnham did
not look at each other but dan saltus
glanced rather curiously at clay var-
ron saltus had heard of paul wall-
mans injury and he rather wondered
what kind of mechanician stanley
would have with him in the thunder-
bolt

  get into your cars gentlemen or-
dered the starter as he waved to the
loud brass band to stop playing
ready

  fie gave a few directions to the
drivers as the eighteen cars in the race
were brought to a stop inside the line
he told them they were to go once
around the track with a big car which
stood a few yards in front of them as
a pacer they were not to pass the
pacer when they came around they
could take a flying start for the real
race as he dropped his flag

  away went the cars even the pre-
liminary rush around the bowl was at
nearly a hundred miles an hour as
they came around again the starter
shouted go-which could not be
heard-and dropped his red flag

  the race was on 

  a great roar arose from the fifty or
sixty thousand people about the track
as the cars tore around the oval every
car was at its best just then and the
first lap of two miles was made at the
rate of ninety-five miles an hour even
by the last one

  the next two miles were covered at
more than a hundred and the drivers
warmed up going higher and higher as
the speedway of fate



each circuit of the great wooden bowl
was completed

  the cars were scattered by this time
the whole track was dotted with them

  the thunderbolt and colutnbiad
were in the ruck neither conspicuously
in the forefront nor far behind both
stanley downs and victor burnham
were holding their cars in contented to
be safe for the present without trying
for a lead

  time would come when some of the
contestants would drop out there
were three hundred and fifty miles to
go altogether plenty of time for the
vicious struggle that must come when
victory lay just among a few of the sur-
vivors

  stanley downs his goggles firmly
adjusted and his eyes gazing straight
ahead knew he had his car well under
control he could feel it leaping for-
ward in response to every light touch
on the throttle while it obeyed the
least turn of the wheel over which he
could just see the yellow-brown pine
flooring ahead

  shes going all right stan shouted
varron in his ear

  perfectly

  i havent heard a sound from her
that shouldnt be there

  nor i

  all right stan keep steady
youll make it reassured clay var-
ron hello that was burnham
he added as a car swept close to them
so that it seemed as if there had been
a deliberate attempt at collision the
man must be crazy

  burnham had driven his long snaky
columbiad so close that stanley had
been obliged to swerve giving his rival
a hundred yards advantage at least
before the thunderbolt could recover

  it was a reckless thing to do if
stanley downs had not been a splendid
driver he might not have got out of
the way in time but burnham had fig-
ured on that pie knew stanley was on

the alert and it was worth a little risk
to get that much ahead he thought

  youve got to make up that gap
stan shouted varron

  stanley downs did not trouble to an-
swer but he let in a little more gas
and his machine jumped forward in
response

  ah  chuckled varron thatll do
it i dont believe- whats that

  a soft crack had reached his ears
it was underneath the car

  without a moments hesitation var-
ron leaned far over the side of the car
and seizing an iron handhold he peered
underneath

  as he pulled himself to his seat again
he shouted to stanley downs

  get down off the track well have
to lose a minute or two not more
hurry

  stanley did not ask what was the
matter until he had steered his car to
the inside of the track in front of the
judges stand he had not quite
stopped when varron was on the
ground a pair of pliers in his hand

  under the car he dived as it came to
a standstill and there was a minutes
work with the pliers then he came
out leaped into his seat and shouted
to stanley go-like the deuce

  up shot the thunderbolt to the track
again and it was going as fast as any
of them almost at once it was not
till the speedometer told that once more
they were doing a hundred miles an
hour that varron volunteered any in-
formation as to what had been wrong

  connecting rod loosened he ex-
plained it had been done purposely
for there was a nut wedged where it
would prevent the thing being found
out at first i never saw anything more
infernally cunning somebody got at
the car while we were having our pic-
tures taken thats the only time it
could have been done for id looked
her over just before that the con-
necting rod was all right then


wide-awake magazine

  well talk about that after the race
said stanley shortly

  the delay had given burnham a start
on the thunderbolt of a whole lap-
two miles

  stanley could not lessen the distance
try as he would he decided after a
dozen circuits of the oval that he would
not try any more just then he would
content himself with not getting any
farther behind

  so far it appeared as if the thun-
derbolt and columbiad were just about
equal in power and speed it would be
nip and tuck even if they were level

  the race kept on and car after car
dropped out unable to stand the gruel-
ing pace when there were a hundred
and fifty miles to go only nine cars
remained-just half the number that
had started

  weve gained one lap on burnham
shouted varron to stanley the other
cars are not in it for first place keep
it up we did a hundred and three
miles an hour for the last lap that
beat burnham go ahead go on 

  varron was wild now he saw that
the thunderbolt was slowly creeping up
on its rival a little more and they
would lap him again

  it must be done the thunderbolt
must win

  he bellowed this through the roar of
the car and though the rushing wind
drove the words back into his throat
he still kept up his frantic cries of en-
couragement to the cool steady driver
at his side

  stanley downs had been in many a
contest before on the football field at
polo and other sports but never had
he taken part in a battle as exciting as
this and never had he been cooler

  he felt that the machine was work-
ing smoothly that every part seemed
to be in perfect accord and that he was
slowly gaining on the rival who had
resolved to beat him at any cost

  clay vari-on had used his oil can at

frequent intervals being a racing car
the thunderbolt could be replenished
with oil from the seat in all of its more
important parts and clay had taken
care there should be no lack of lubri-
cant

  twenty forty a hundred miles had
been covered and stanley downs lifted
his machine almost even with the co-
lumbiad another effort and he would
pass

  it was at this instant that stanley
caught a glimpse out of the corner of
his eye of the driver of the columbiad
as the latter turned his head slightly
in the direction of his rival also he
saw that the mechanician dan saltus
was shouting something to burnham
as he raised his hand apparently in
remonstrance

  it was all so quick that afterward
stanley downs did not know exactly
what he had seen in the columbiad

  just as saltus shouted there was a
quick swerve of the columbiad and it
crowded toward the thunderbolt

  it was the same trick that burnham
had played early in the race and which
then might have resulted in the hor-
rible death of the four men in the two
cars

  stanley gripped his wheel tighter and
tried to steer out of the way even al-
though he knew it would lose for him
two or three hundred precious yards

  but he did not go quite far enough
the columbiad bore down on him and
the two raced along for a second or
two with only a few inches separating
them

  then came the crash by one of
those curious combinations of circum-
stances not uncommon in automobiling
it chanced that a rear corner of the
thunderbolt clipped the other car just
where it would upset its gravity

  bang smash

  the columbiad was on its side while
stanley quickly recovering from the
jar whirled on alone
the speedway of fate



  there was no time for stanley to
look at the wreck he kept on with
the race he must win no matter who
might be hurt it is the cruel rule in
races of all kinds only those not in
the actual contest can give time to look
after those who may have fallen in
the struggle

  as they tore around on the next lap
keeping well clear of the wrecked car
varron saw men lifting burnham and
his mechanician away and the next
time around the columbiad had been
turned over on its wheels by a score
of men and pushed out of the way

  it did not take long to cover the re-
maining distance as stanley downs
rushed the thunderbolt over the finish
line his number went up on the board
number  wins directly afterward
the time was recorded also 

  this meant that the thunderbolt had
covered the three hundred and fifty
miles at an average speed of more than
one hundred and three miles an hour

 stanley downs had beaten the
record

  it was some time before stanley
could get to a certain car parked in the
infield in whom he had seen an elderly
gentleman to whom he wanted very
much to speak

  there were a number of formalities
to be gone through the man who had
won the lawrence cup could not be al-
lowed to go away till he had been ad-
dressed by the judges and had his
photograph taken

  then he had to go and change his
clothes after a shower bath and do
various other things to bring him back
to his usual appearance

  it was all clone at last however and
he dashed for the car that had been
his aim all along since he had finished
the race and had time to look about him

  uncle he cried as the elderly gen-
tleman took his hand in a warm strong
grip somehow i had a feeling that
youd come-especially when i got no

reply to my telegram im very glad
to see you

  richard burwin was an unemotional
man as a rule but there were tears
behind his glasses as he said brokenly
stan my boy i knew all about it
i know more than you do that fellow
burnham was pretty slick but not quite
slick enough for the old man i had
his measure from the first however

hes dead so-

  dead 

  yes he was smashed all to pieces
crushed almost to a jelly dreadful
thing of course but he got it when
he tried to crowd you off the track-or
kill you i dont believe he cared what
he did his mechanician will get well
they say

  tin glad to hear that said stanley
earnestly

  so am i came from richard bur-
win i am told he confessed when
they carried him off the track and when
he thought he was dying that he had
stolen a package of twenty thousand
dollars from you when you were at
the track before you started for new
york in your car

  stole it cried stanley dazed
yes he changed it on you com-
mon trick among crooks you know
the old green-goods game so you
had only a bundle of worthless paper
with a real bank note on the outside
in your car pocket thats what went
to the bottom of the lake the money
is safe the fellow says well get it
back when weve seen him at the hos-
pital and got his formal confession
now lets get away from here were
going to take luncheon with ranfelt-
an old friend of mine-prentiss and

miss ranfelt-

  why mr downs wont you let me
congratulate you  broke in the sweet
voice of helen ranfelt i have been
trying to do it all the time you have
been talking to mr burwin then in
a lower tone that only stanley could


wide-awake magazine

hear you know how much this
means to me i am horrified at mr
burnhams death but-wouldnt it
have been dreadful if he had won the
race

hello helen how do you think
youd like to be a mechanician asked

clay varron laughing as he took his
fair cousins hand its great sport i
assure you

  clay youre splendid she an-
swered if you hadnt helped mr
downs to win the cup i never would
have forgiven you

some new inventions

    to convert an ordinary wash boiler into a washing machine an inventor
has patented a metal cone perforated at the top so that jets of boiling water
are forced through clothing	

    an electrical annunciator device operated by push buttons on chairs through-
out a hall is working successfully in holland to auction eggs without the usual
noise and confusion of such sales

    both the moistening and sealing of letters is done in a single operation by
a new office implement in which a dampened roller passes under the flaps ahead
of a larger one that closes them

    to enable automobiles to pull themselves up hills or out of soft spots in
roads a south dakota inventor has patented a windlass which may be attached
to the rear hub of the car and operated by a motor

    a seattle man has invented a device which keeps automobiles from skid-
ding on wet pavements there is a receptacle under the rear seat of the car
in which sand is placed and by pressing a pedal on the floor of the car the
sand is released and spread in front of the rear wheels giving instant traction

    a tin hood which fits over a roosters head and neck in such a way as to
prevent the fowl from heralding the dawn has been invented a rooster did
too much early-morning crowing near a police station and one of the police-
men devised the invention which is said to work perfectly and without injur-
ing the rooster

    a pump that not only pumps up an automobile tire within a few minutes
but that keeps the tire at that pressure regardless of large punctures is a new
invention the pump can be attached to the hub of the wheel in less than
a minute it works on the rotary-pump principle each revolution of the wheel
while running the car driving air into the tire

    in putting up tall buildings contractors have had a problem in boring holes
in steel beams wherein to place the rivets those little bands of steel that are vital
to the erection of skyscrapers by putting a trained army of drillers at work the
contractor has been able to drill correctly probably five hundred holes a day
a new machine invented by a los angeles man has demonstrated that it can
bore thirty perfect holes in two and one-half minutes requiring in the opera-
tion the services of one man and a dynamo generating sixteen and one-half horse
power this boring is done in a steel beam three inches thick the gang drill
as it is called can also be used on iron pipes it is said that one man using the
machine can do the work of ten not only cheaper but more accurately

chapter viii

bully carson explains

khe shrewd eyes of colo-
nel carson sparkled with
a sly twinkle he sat
before his deep-throated
fireplace in his home in
carsonville into the
room he had called his
son bully to receive
from him a full account of the recent
startling happenings and the result of
the investigation which had followed

  bully had come in prepared to put
his part in the affair in the best light
possible yet he would speak to his-
father with more openness than he
would to any one else for it was
known that the elder carson had sown
in his youth a pretty big crop of wild
oats himself

a

  with that sly humorous twinkle
carson turned on his hopeful son in
a way he was proud of bully though
he raged at him daily

  i hear ye got out of ft bully but
it took some hard work and tall lyin
ive jest got home but ive been bear-
in about it id been down to that in-
vestigation myself if id been here
probly some o the things ive heard
aint so so ye can jest straighten me
out about it

  this was so much better than bully
had anticipated that the sour expression
passed from his coarse red face feel-
ing more comfortable he stood up
with his broad back to the fire and
taking out a cigar bit off the end of it
and scratched a match

  well twas the funniest and sin-
glarest thing that ever came down the
pike dad and for a while it lookeds if


wide-awake magazine

they had me in bad it was clancy and
kess that went gunnin for me and
come nigh bringin me down but ill
git even with em for that see

  he lighted his cigar and stood smok-
ing

  and me and chip merriwell are due
to have some interestin times too
theyre all in together and he has hit
at me more than once

  young merriwell was in a box or
trunk in the baggage car unconscious
and about dead when they put it off
here and you was charged with havin
that trunk or box put on the car of
course you didnt and know nothin
about it youre a mighty big fool at
times bully but youre not so big a one
as that and thered have been no sense
in it

  bullys face glowed to a dull and an-
gry crimson as he recalled the grilling
he had been put through by the police
officers because of that accusation

  me and that young hindu kadir
dhin was charged with doin it and
theyd have fastened it on him sure if
colonel gunn hadnt come to his help
for you see it was kadir dhins
hindu trunk that they found merri-
well in it looked mighty bad for him
a while and looked bad for me too
jest because i had been with him not
long before and had given the baggage
man a quarter at the station for bring-
in down for me a box of stuff from
dickeys that it would have cost me a
dollar to send in the reglar way

  theres a whole big story back of
it dad bully explained and there
were some things i didnt know myself
until gunn made that statement to the
officers kadir dhin had been treat-
ing me fine as silk and i was going
around with him a lot he had spend-
in money and he wasnt afraid to blow
it it wasnt my bizness to ask him
how he got it yet he came to fardale
as you recklect as a sort of charity stu-

dent i thought he had mebby been
gamblin and had been lucky

  he was talkin aginst merriwell
and plannin ways to do him and 
liked that and we did do him in
the end as ill tell you

  it started when that girl was miss-
in out of gunns house where she has
been stayin old gunn sent out an
alarm about it and telephoned the con-
stable in a little while it seemed as
if half the town was searchin for her
kadir dhin and me had been trying to
annoy merriwell that forenoon when
he was out sleighin with her by foller-
in him round in another sleigh

  you did that growled the elder
carson with a sniff of displeasure as
he pulled at his yellow-gray goatee
 twasnt the act of a gentleman son

  but bully answered with a careless
laugh

  anyhow twas fun we was hopin
to make him so mad that afterward he
would want to climb us and so give us
a chance to double on him together and
trim him good kadir dhin had it in
for him for a knock-out blow merry
had given him and ive got some things
to remember

  well when she was missin that aft-
ernoon and we saw merriwell goin to-
ward the lake lookin for her we fol-
lered him again when we got down
there i turned back because it was so
cold so i didnt see what happened
and theres two stories about it

  kadir dhin sayrs he found the girl
bewildered and wanderin about in that
timbered cove beyond the pavilion and
was tryin to lead her home when mer-
riwell came on him and attacked him
the attack cornin so sudden kadir
dhin says that he had no time to de-
fend himself before he was knocked
stiff in the snow

    think thats right too said bully
for thats the way he told it to me
when he met me again close by the
corner at gunns merriwell had
frank merriwell jr at fardale



brought the girl home and was then
in the house kadir dhin had follered
and say he was lookin wicked a man
lookin as he did then would sure put
a knife in a feller in the dark

  as he begun to tell me about it we
walked on over toward the barracks
he was ravin theres nobody much
at the barracks now because nearly all
the fellers have gone home for the hol-
idays and we stood there talkin it
over kadir dhin sayin he wished mer-
riwell would come along on his way to
his room in the barracks that he
wanted to meet him there and settle
with him

  and just then we saw him cornin
from gunns kadir dhin put his hand
in his coat pocket and i thought lie was
divin for a knife

  none o that i says to him
theres two of us and if he had a
knife he didnt draw it but he turned
a funny yellow kind o white and i
knew that something was coming go
at him fair i says and ill back you 

  right out in public too com-
mented colonel carson shows how
many different kinds of idiot y aire
bully

  it seemed quiet enough nobody on
the parade ground and didnt seem to
be anybody in the barracks anyhow
then was the time if it was to be done
and youre to recklect that it wasnt me
but the hindu that planned it

   i want to speak with you said
kadir dhin when merriwell came up
im goin to settle with you right now
he didnt strike out at him but slid
his hand along as if he was tryin to
get merriwell by the throat at that
merriwell hit him and knocked him
back against the barracks wall and
then i came in

  he stopped and drew in his breath
heavily

  when you fight your own battles
bully i dont object but when you

fight those of other people and  coin

coming in for it-

  thats all right dad but id owed
merriwell a licking a long time

  and you took that chance to pay
it

  i guess he thinks i paid him but
for a while he probbly wasnt in a con-
dition to appreciate it we left him
layin there in the snow when we had
started off we saw him crawl to his
feet and stagger int the buildin
bully laughed gleefully he sure was
lookin sick

  and this young hindu went away
with ye

  he went as far as the street corner
beyond the parade ground and i didnt
see him again until we was both of us
hauled up before the officers here
charged with puttin merriwell in that
trunk and tryin to kill him

  how did he git into that trunk
the elder carson demanded you said
it was kadir dhins

  blessed if i know how he did git
into it bully declared jest between
you and me dad it looks like kadir
dhin went back there to the barracks
and mebby found him in a faint from
that lickin and put him in but kadir
dhin savs he didnt merriwell told
the officers that after he got to his room
he fainted and that when he came to
he was here in carsonville and he
didnt know himself how twas done
kadir dhin told the officers that he
didnt go back to the barracks at all
after leaving me at the corner but that
after a while he went down to the sta-
tion and when he saw the trunk there
he looked at it wonderip whose it was
as it looked so much like his and had
no marks  it

  and it was right there said bully
when he wasnt being believed and the
thing would have been cinched on him
that colonel gunn came popping in to
his rescue with the most amazing yarn
ye ever listened to


wide-awake magazine

  i think i heard some o that but
you go over it for mebby i didnt git
it straight seems to me bully you
was mighty reckless all along and its
a wonder to me y aint in the jail
fie was looking at bully closely his
brows were furrowed and the half-hu-
morous light had faded out of his eyes
he was again pulling at his yellow-gray
goatee this time nervously

  colonel gunn said bully ex-
plained that a hindu soldier who had
killed the girls father in france was
known to be somewhere around here
and once before had tried to carry her
off and twashis belief that this hindu
had got into the barracks

  and then added bully to bolster
this they brought on again the hack-
maii who had taken the trunk to the
station he had said that a dark-faced
feller who was dressed in the fardale
cadet uniform had hired him to take
the trunk to the station and he had
identified kadir dhin as bein that fel-
ler but now when he heard what
gunn said about it he backed water
and admitted that though the dark-
faced feller looked like kadir dhin it
might not have been him he couldnt
identify kadir dhin as being the one
he said now what dye think of
that

  lied snorted carson

  but kadir dhin has told me him-
self that he knows nothin about it
he lied too

  anyway they let kadir dhin off on
account of what colonel gunn told em
and now officers are out lookin for the
other hindu

  they wont find him said carson
  he glared at his son

  bully ive tried to give ye some
instructions ye know ive said to you
that a man is ginrally justified in takin
a sportin chance on most anything
that promises good money but that to
be safe hes alius got to keep on the
right side o the law

  wasnt i  bully roared i might
a been fined for fightin but what else
i didnt have anything to do with that
trunk bizness

  who checked that trunk

  nobody thats the funny part of
it the men at the station shoved it
into the car without noticin seein it
there with other trunks and the bag-
gageman didnt notice or he says he
didnt until clancy called it to his atten-
tion

  clancy and kess thought they had
heard some one groaning in the trunk
and when it went into the car they went
in too and then when they heard the
sound again in the car they raised a
row and the trunk was put off here
and opened

  now theres the case said bully
breathing heavily only the baggage-
man will get fired for he was held here
and questioned by the officers and when
they drove him into a corner he had
to admit that he had received a quar-
ter from me for carryin the box i
brought down from dickeys i had
told that to save my own bacon when
it seemed they was goin to prove that
i had given him the money for trans-
portin the trunk and he had to say
that it was so that it was only the box
i had paid for

  i reckon that baggageman lied about
knowin no more than he said about the
trunk carson observed dont you
think he did bully

  i dont know dad

  well its mixin wheres merri-
well

  hes been sent home he was all in
hardly able to tell his story i may git
fined yet he added uneasily for toy-
in with him too rough there at the
barracks but clancy and kess are

still here and-

  keep away from em

  dad i wont bully declared  not
until ive finished with em and
therell be some good money as well as
frank merriwell jr at fardale



satisfaction in linin up aginst em it
will be kadir dhin and the duke and
me and a lot more inside the barracks
and out that will be havin some inter-
esting sessions with clancy merriwell
and company dad you can count on
that and the duke-well you know
he has got money to burn and ill
never refuse to help him burn it hes
been talkin to me since this examina-
tion and he says that this whole thing
can be used to put chip merriwell on
the run and we can now down him
the twinkle came again into the eyes
of the elder carson he admired
pluck and had been a rough-and-tum-
ble fighter in his youth

  i cant jest approve of the way two
of you jumped onto merriwell he
observed things like that tend to ac-
cumulate a reppytation for cowardice
bully reppytation is a thing to be
considered basil or the duke as you
call him is a fool with money and i
cant blame ye much for wantin to git
next but be careful bully a sport-
in proposition is one thing but takin
criminal chances is another alius keep
on the right side o the law bully in
the long run it pays better

  he tugged at his goatee again

  but that curus trunk case is shore
mixin bully i think moren one fel-
ler done some tall lyin

chapter ix

some investigations

when chip merriwell returned
to fardale he found himself
against the line-up of which
bully carson had spoken to his father

  but he had received word of it be-
fore clancy had written to him about
it and it was the first subject that
clan took up when he met chip at the
station on the latters return

  i suppose kess and i are to blame
said clan remorsefully just because
we werent satisfied with getting you

out of that trunk but tried to unload 
kadir dhin the crime of putting you
there but they oughtnt to hold that
against you colonel gunn oughtnt
anyway

  sure nodt agreed kess who was
with him vodt dhey ar-re saying
apoudt me tondt hurdt nopoty but dhey
ar-re making you oudt a willain yoost
like us

  chip laughed kess amused him
and he was feeling physically fit again
which of itself makes for light-heart-
edness he had been sent home all
in now he was back at the end of
the christmas holidays ready again to
enter the old fardale school and reas-
sume the leadership of the loyal fel-
lows who were always his friends

  we are all villains together eh he
commented

  the sympathy stunt is being worked
hard for kadir dhin clan reported
you accused him of trying to kidnap
rose maitland and flattened him out
on the ice and you repeated the accusa-
tion to colonel gunn when you got her
to gunns house on top of that kess
and i tried to make the officers down
at carsonville believe that kadir dhin
had found you in a faint in your room
in the barracks and had put you in that
trunk i guess we went too fast in
that and theres where the trouble be-
gins  we couldnt make the officers be-
lieve kadir dhin would put you in a
trunk that could be so easily identified
as his so when gunn came down and
strung his talk about the soldier hindu
our idea was canned and kadir dhin
was released with an apology

  and now gunn is looking black at
us rose maitland is looking blacker
and every enemy you ever had seems
to have come to life and is working
against you their leader seems to be
duke basil and i guess yon know what
that means

  chip knew well enough

  the previous year anselm basil fa-


wide-awake magazine

miliarly known as the duke had come
over with a number of fellows from
brightwood and entered fardale hav-
ing discovered that it was the better
school the duke had been the athletic
leader at brightwood and had no no-
tion of playing second fiddle to any one
even at fardale

  duke basil was an original genius
not because he was rich and a spend-
thrift for many boys and young men
are that but because with all his as-
sumptions and airs and extravagances
he had athletic ability and brains of a
high order and had so many good qual-
ities with the bad ones

  that chip and basil should clash
was a thing not to be avoided basil
had declared to his friends that he in-
tended to be the leader at fardale and
that there could be but one he had
not made his boasts good so the clash
was renewed at the beginning of the
present school year yet so far with no
very creditable results or decided vic-
tories to his account

  now he beiieved he had found new
leverage in the first place it seemed
that colonel gunns good opinion of
chip and his friends had been alien-
ated  which meant that the iron rules of
the academy would be made to bear
hard on them and could be worked to
their disadvantage kadir dhin the
colonels protege had been made the im-
placable enemy of chip and his crowd
and bully carson a foe not to be de-
spised even though he was not in the
academy had all his old animosities re-
aroused

  clancy and kess tried to set these
things forth as they made their way
with chip over the snowy roads from
the station to the academy grounds hav-
ing preferred walking to riding in the
usual hack that they might talk mat-
ters over

  chip merriwell was thinking of how
these things would influence his rela-
tions with rose maitland rather than

viewing them from the standpoint of
his friends he was hoping that colo-
nel gunns adverse opinions were not
affecting her even though she were a
member of his household and kadir
dhin had been her fathers friend and
secretary

  there was always an unpleasant
memory tucked in the back of chips
mind which he seldom cared to take
out of its pigeonhole there and con-
sider his first meeting with rose
maitland could not have been more in-
auspicious than it was he had knocked
kadir dhin down in the snowy path on
account of his treatment of kess and
rose maitland rushing frantically to
the side of the young hindu had called
chip a coward with such a sting in the
word that chip could still feel the burn
of it whenever he permitted himself to
let it enter his mind

  as chip and his friends turned into
the path beyond mrs winfields board-
ing house that led to and through the
parade ground kadir dhin was seen
standing there much as he had been
on that previous occasion only that this
time he was in conversation with duke
basil

  they are regular siamese twins
lately said clancy with a grin they
knew you were to arrive to-day and
have been wondering why you didnt
ride up in the hack

  uff he standts in my roadt like vot
he dit pefore-

  but kadir dhin was moving on to-
ward the barracks before kess finished
his sentence the duke had turned to-
ward the village moving to meet them

  ah there he cried putting out his
hand as chip came up youre looking
fine as silk again old top t didnt ex-
pect it that little rest at home has
done you a lot of good

  for an instant chip hesitated then
held out his hand he would be as gen-
tlemanly as the duke indeed it was
hard not to be friendly with duke basil
frank merriwell jr at fardale 

on all ordinary occasions he had a
smile and a bright way with him it
was this that made him so formidable
when lie pitted his strength against
chip for this quite as much as his
money enabled him to gather and hold
friends

  im all right again said chip talc-
ing the measure of the fellow with his
eye you went home yourself i
think

  sure had a fine time too

  he did not offer to shake hands with
kess and clancy whom he had seen be-
fore that day but he swung on along
the path after greeting chip

  he iss smile like a raddlesnalce pe-
fore idt pites der handt vot feedts idt
kess observed idt iss too badt apoudt
dot veller aber a man iss my enemy
i vandt him to look like idt

 they found that kadir dhin had
gone  to his room

  chip went to his which he occupied
with clancy but they were soon drawn
out of it by hearing kess in a clatter
of noisy words with the young hindu

  villums capacity for blundering was
notorious he had seen that kadir
dhins door stood open and had en-
tered without apology apparently to no-
tify the young hindu that chip merri-
well had returned and to ash

  undt vot vill you do apoudt idt
chip was not at all averse to invad-
ing the hindus room for he wanted
to get a look at the trunk in which he
unconscious had been immured on that
journey which might readily have ended
in his death the noisy words ceased
when chip and clan came to the door

  he iss say dot i am anodher kess
protested

  chip and clan stepped into the room
chip with a smile which he hoped
would temporarily disarm kadir dhins
enmity lie glanced over at the queer
hindu trunk or traveling chest of it-
self an interesting specimen of oriental
workmanship

  so that was the thing i was in he
commented ignoring kess complaint
it seems that i ought to remember it
but i dont

  you remember as much about it as
i do in spite of the charges of your
friends kadir dhin asserted

  there was a malevolent glare in his
shiny black eyes

  chip sat down in the nearest chair
he did not intend to be ruffled he had
long since discovered that  one gains
anything by turning his quills out like
a porcupine

  i was in no position to make any
claims about it but ive wondered
about it hundreds of times as i was
found in that thing somebody put me
there

  perhaps you did it yourself said
the young hindu with a sneer though
his manner was guarded its as cred-
ible as that i did it

  chip looked at him when his atten-
tion was not directed toward the queer
trunk he was hoping that if kadir
dhin really knew anything about that
odd happening by some slip or by the
expression of his face he might reveal
it

  what is it about that hindu sol-
dier he asked that is what do
you know  i heard what colonel gunn
said at that investigation but  wasnt
in a mental condition to take it all in
did you know the man

  kadir dhin stared at him hesitated
and then answered

  he was my uncle

  do you think he is here

  i know nothing about that said
kadir dhin ask colonel gunn

  he says the man is here and did
that

  then you know as much about it as
i do asserted kadir dhin with an im-
patient wave of his hand

  but do you believe it

  that is my business if i say i
dont you will then declare that i must


wide-awake magazine

have put you in the trunk youd bet-
ter talk to colonel gunn about it i
dont know anything

  youre a hindu said clancy butt-
ing in

  a flush of anger put color into the
dark cheeks of kadir dhin

   i have that honor he declared

  yet you speak english better than
most americans

  i was educated at the english school
in madras if  was ignorant of the
language could i have taken a place in
this school you talk like a fool re-
member that i was lieutenant mait-
lands secretary translating all his writ-
ten orders to his hindu soldiers into
their native dialects i am doubtless a
fool-lor talking with you but i am not
an ignoramus

  he turned to chip

  if you have looked at that trunk
long enough and have asked all your

questions-

  fired cried clancy come on
chip

  this german beer keg came in to
insult me and you followed to back
him up said the young hindu

  not at all chip insisted but
were going well have no words i
had a natural curiosity to see that trunk
thats all thank you for the permis-
sion good day

  oh well meet again said kadir
dhin theres a settlement coming
for the accusations you made against
me when you brought miss maitland to
gunns ive a good memory

  mine is quite as good chip re-
torted with a sudden scowl i
couldnt have been tossed into that
trunk like a bag of meal if you and
bully carson hadnt doubled on me and
pounded me senseless recollect that
there will be other debts to pay when
you begin to pay off yours

  clan and kess followed him grum-
bling

  why didnt you punch his head for
that clan demanded

  you forget clan i didnt go there
to quarrel in the first place then
were in the barracks and youve said
yourself that colonel gunn would be
pleased to get ne in chancery ive got
to be careful

  however though he knew that colo-
nel gunn was explosive and crotchety
chip was not ready to accept the no-
tion that the colonel would not treat
him fairly in any situation

  so it was not because he wanted to
test the colonels feelings that chip
went over to gunns house that after-
noon  he wanted to see rose maitland
the last time he had seen her she was
bewildered and hysterical

  that had passed off entirely she
came in to meet him bright-eyed and
smiling yet chip thought she looked
pale and that her smile hid a feeling
of anxiety she soon admitted that she
stood in deathly fear of the hindu who
was still the man of mystery to chip

  i was feeling so safe you know
she said in her frank way the con-
stable had given colonel gunn such as-
surances i had been going about with
confidence so i thought i needed no
one to guard me while i went out on
the ice a little while and down there
everything was so quiet and peaceful
that i really went farther than i meant
to go i skated on and on until i was
down by the boathouse i supposed the
place was unoccupied

  weve stored our ice yacht and
snowshoes and skis and things like that
in it said chip

  but no one has been staying there
regularly 

  no

  thats what i thought yet the far-
dale students go in and out of there
as i knew so when i heard some one
call to me from the boathouse i thought
at first it was you and then thought it
must be kadir dhin and as i didnt
frank merriwell jr at fardale



understand just what was said but got
the impression that you-i mean kadir
dhin-was hurt and needed help i ran
up to the door on my skates

  i knew that it wasnt you-i mean
kadir dhin-when it was too late i
was blinded by a cloth that struck me
in the face as i opened the door it
fell over my head as if it would smother
me and it was filled with the odor of
a powerful drug while i fought to get
my head out of the cloth the drug over-
came me

  she was trembling the color had left
her cheeks

  before i became so dizzy and be-
wildered she added i heard the man
speak and i recognized his voice as that
of gunga singh the hindu soldier who
murdered my father the odor of the
drug i had encountered before in india
a man was once murdered there and
that drug was used i was with father
when he made an investigation of the
murder

  you didnt see the man at all then
said chip

  no

  you couldnt have been mistaken
about him

  i know what you mean she said
but i recognized his voice

  i found you wandering around in
that cove beyond the pavilion

  i dont know how i got there by
which i mean i have no remembrance
of it of course gunga singh took
me there kadir dhin frightened him
and he fled through the trees kadir
dhin was trying to guide me home
they say you accused him and attacked
him im sorry kadir dhin was my
fathers friend and is mine colonel
gunn knows that

  chip did not know what to say he
did not like to declare he was uncon-
vinced

  kadir dhin had come down to the
lake and had gone in that direction i

thought he was not trying to lead you
home i didnt see the other man
you do think that of kadir dhin
now  she urged

   have  right to if you are sure
i am wrong

  im sure you are

  i was excited when i brought you
home when i rushed on him kadir
dhin tried to shoot me or i thought
he meant to so when colonel gunn
came asking questions i said that and
accused kadir dhin i saw that what i
said offended colonel gunn

  then you had trouble with kadir
dhin at the barracks im sorry you
were so quick and did him a serious
wrong its too bad i wish you could
be friends dont you think you were
too quick

  chip saw that kadir dhin had been
telling lies here

  at the barracks i did no more than
defend myself that is i tried i didnt
succeed very well

  you again attacked kadir dhin
there 

  vo he attacked me and he had
bully carson with him you dont
know carson but hes a big fellow and
a bruiser

  kadir dhin says you attacked him
there and then that carson rushed in
and knocked you down oh dear 
dislike to talk about it its horrible
you were too quick

  in one thingi was too quick said
chip i was too quick in going on to
the barracks i ought to have gone
back to the lake i didnt see this
hindu gunga singh but then was
my chance to follow his tracks into and
through the woods there and see what
became of him id like to get on the
track of him now and will watch out
for him how was he dressed

  kadir dhin says he wore a fardale
uniform

  so thats odd a fardale uni-
form but i recall that it was reported


wide-awake magazine

that some one thought to have been a
burglar had stolen clothing out of the
barracks

  kadir dhin fears gunga singh as
much as i do he is watching for him
and will have him apprehended if he
can he and colonel gunn have been
laying some plans about it i wish you
would apologize to kadir dhin he is
sensitive and is very much hurt
having pieced into the story of the
affair the scraps with which he had not
been familiar chip soon took his leave

  his meeting with rose maitland had
not made him as happy as he had antici-
pated

chapter x

reckless villum

while you were away clan
was saying to chip later i
was tempted to put over a dic-
tograph scheme that would have been
great i met a fellow down at the sta-
tion who was agent for the things if
i could have put one in the dukes
room with concealed wires running
from it to this we could have got at
the bottom of the rascals planning
but id have had to bribe more than
one person and then the problem of
getting the wires across bothered me
so i passed it up

  chip laughed

  so it was the bother of the wires
and not any feeling that the thing
wouldnt be quite a square play but i
thought the great mechanical head you
developed while running that garage
down in phoenix was equal to any-
thing

  kess was twisting in his chair and
his blue eyes were glistening

  dot ticktograft hears vot you say
dhere unt rebeadts idt here 

  something like that villum its a
sort of secret telephone

  uh-huh  i standt under idt unt idt
vouldt haf been greadt

no conscientious scruples nor even

the fear of discovery would have kept
villum from putting the scheme over
if he could have done it he would
have had wires running not only to
the dukes room but to kadir dhins
and to the room of every other fellow
he suspected at present of being en-
gaged in scheming against them

  vale idt iss inderesdting he said
as he got lazily out of his chair but
i cant tink apowet idt now i haf
got to gedt me some more ackvainted
mit chulius cassar

  yet he was still thinking about it as
he went to his room to tackle his latin
and follow the wanderings and battles
of cassar

  that night having been out in the
village as he was passing dicreys
place on his way to the barracks the
hour for closing the barracks being at
hand kess ran into a dog fight a
pair of airedales one of them being
dickeys opened a furious combat right
in front of him

  villum jumped back out of the way
yiminy he said almosdt i hadt
a toe bit off

  out of dickeys poured a miscel-
laneous crowd dickey in the midst
with a pail of water which he threw
over the fighting dogs in the hope that
it would separate them

  when maddened airedales come to-
gether such gentle measures are pretty
sure to fail dickey was soon con-
vinced that his dog was being mur-
dered so he got the other dog by the
hind legs and the tail and began to
yell to the squirming and clamoring mob
of spectators to help him separate the
animals by pulling them apart

  in the background to which kess had
retreated he was unobserved but not
unobservant he saw in the crowd bully
carson duke basil kadir dhin and
-to his great surprise-robert realf
some other young fellows wearing the
fardale uniform were cadets whose
homes were in the village and who by
frank merriwell jr at fardale 

living at home gained greater freedom
for their evenings

  bully carson could be expected to be
at dickeys if in the village birds of
his plumage congregated there natu-
rally but that kadir dhin should be
there was most unexpected

  dickeys was a place that colonel
gunn cordially hated and zenas gale
watched with zealous and suspicious
eyes ostensibly it was a cigar and
periodical store dealing also in a small
way in students supplies such as writ-
ing material and even secondhand
books this was a cover to sales of
liquor and unlimited poker playing
students liked to gather there even
those who had no relish for liquor or
gaming on account of the freedom of
the atmosphere yet visits to the place
put one under suspicion and threat-
ened the displeasure of gunn and the
fardale faculty

  gunn had often spoken to the far-
dale boys on the subject and he had
been heard to say that whenever the
opportunity came he would put dickey
through gale the constable was of
the same mind but the opportunity
never came for dickey was the slick-
est cake of soap in fardale

  so villum kess was amazed to see
gunns protege kadir dhin in the
crowd that swarmed out of dickeys
when the dog fight began

  budt idt iss der ticktograft obbor-
dunity vot i am nodt oxbecting
thought villum

  not a soul remained in dickeys it
had emptied into the street and every
person there was too busy trying to
separate the dogs or in telling others
how it could be done to observe or to
think of anything else dickey was
himself yelling orders like a village fire
chief

  so villum edged along the wall and
reaching the steps he passed within
then looked back to see if he had been
observed sure that he had not he

  made his way hurriedly to a door at
the rear which he found unlocked and
entered the back room famous in far-
dale annals as the scene of strenuous
poker games smokefests and drink-
ing bouts

  there was a back door but it was
locked and some rooms above to be
reached by a stairway also there
were heavily blinded windows in the
middle of the room stood a table with
a green cloth top with chairs about it
and above it a swinging electric light
that had a turndown attachment
along the walls were more chairs with
plush lounges and at the farther end
a couple of low cots whereon it was
said dickey stowed students and oth-
ers who had swallowed too much of
his strong liquor and were not able to
go on to the barracks or to their homes
the strong drink dickey was reported
to furnish was not kept here-there
was always danger of a raid kess had
heard it was kept buried in the cellar
but this may not have been so 

  as his blue eyes roved round on the
interior of the room villum moved to-
ward the cots at the farther end

  i vouldt yoost as lief been hung
for sdealing a big sheeb as a liddle
lamb so i go me der whole hog he
was muttering -uff i am foundt der
ticktograft vill be proke unt no more
can be saidt

  with a last look around villum
dropped to the iloor and with squirm-
ing jerks stowed his rotund body un-
der one of the cots

  something else under there squirmed
villums hands were thrust into the face
of a man

  awk villum exploded unable in
his surprise to suppress the sound and
he clawed backward like a turtle trying
to get out

but the dog fight had been ended
and dickey and his friends were
streaming into the front room villum
did not realize that he might have joined


wide-awake magazine

them there in that time of confusion
without attracting undue attention un-
til it was too late to try it he was
temporarily paralyzed by his discovery
of the man under the cot before he
recovered some of the fellows were
entering the back room and were sit-
ting down in the chairs by the table

  i am sure in a fixings thought
villum perspiring with the terror of
the thought

  the man under the cot had moved
over as close to the wall as he could get
but villum still felt the touch of him
his imagination supplying details he
pictured a knife in the mans hands
and coming on top of that like a flash
was the thought

  idt iss der hindu murterer i pet
you

  that made villums flesh creep and
nearly popped him from under the cot
he moved over shivering but he did
not leave his shelter he would have
fared badly if he had so in the end
he preferred to stick to the frying pan
rather than to flop out into the fire

  besides villum had slipped into the
room and shoved under that cot for the
purpose of playing dictograph and he
was stubborn enough to want to stick
to his purpose

  a number of guesses as to who the
man was and why he was there fol-
lowed villums surmise that he was the
hindu murderer any one of them was
bad enough if true

  the man might be a common burglar
who had found a chance to hide there
and later meant to connect with dick-
eys safe if so he was no doubt armed
with an automatic which he would use
if cornered this seemed a very rea-
sonable solution

  but villum never hunted for reason-
able solutions when others could be
had so the one which appealed to his
mind most was that the man under the
cot with him was not only the hindu
murderer but that this cot and room

  were his usual and customary hiding
places which indicated that dickey
knew he was there and received pay for
sheltering him

  kess and his friends had wondered
where the hindu could keep himself so
that he would be safe and out of sight
while he matured his plans kess one
wild guess and until now he could make
no other was that the hindu hid in
kadir dhins oriental trunk he
thought he saw now that this guess was
wrong

  aber i hear all vot iss saidt unt
am kilt as  am getting oudt uff here
mit idt-ach dot vill be awvul vil-
lum said to himself as if groaning men-
tally yedt anodder fighdt mighdt
come petween dhis hindu unt der vel-
lers in der room unt vunce again i
couldt gedt me by so i vill vaidt pe-
cause  musdt unt vill seen vot i hear

  it was a long and trying wait that
followed and it seemed much longer
than it was soon all chance of gain-
ing the barracks before they were closed
for the night had passed but then
villum had counted on not being able
to return to the barracks

  under the cot pressed close against
the wall the man waited as silently as
villum and however much or little
he understood of the meaning of vil-
lums action he must have considered
that he found himself in a most singu-
lar position

chapter xi

kess as a dictograph

the pasty-faced youth who took a
seat on the table and sat swing-
ing his legs while he fished out
of his pocket a gold-mounted cigarette
case angrily resented the imputation of
bully carson

  aw cut it out he snarled nastily
my sister is too nice a girl to have
comments made about her by a low
bruiser like you 
frank merriwell jr at fardale



  bully carsons face -flamed as red
as his necktie the veins on his fore-
head started his hands closed into
maullike lists and he stepped forward
yet instantly he checked himself and
rattled out a wheezing laugh he could
not afford to offend this young fellow

  forget it i he said in a tone of
hoarse apology i didnt mean noth-
in and of course i knew it wasnt so
even when i said it i was only in a
manner suggestin what others may
think

  robert realf stared at him repel-
lently

  since you forgot yourself and said
that ill simply explain that my sister
is visiting with nellie stanley at mrs
winfields just as she did last winter
you know that bob stanley is a stu-
dent in the academy here and is her
brother and both nellie and my sister
are friends of mrs winfield besides
im down here with her weve got
money to travel round with and go
where we like when we want to more
money than you will ever see carson
though you cheat and steal for a hun-
dred years

  forget it said carson though the
blood was in his face i didnt mean
anything at all as i told you of
course i was too fresh

  then he mumbled something about
having had a drink too much which
was the cause of it

  kess was so interested that he al-
most forgot the sinister touch of the
man behind him for carsons intima-
tion had been that rhoda realf was at
fardale in the hope that she was here
to get to see chip merriwell

  kess knew all about the rather furi-
ous love affair between chip and
rhoda which had begun down in santa
fe when her wealthy father was down
there looking at mining claims and
chip was assisting his uncle dick who
was the mine investigator it had been
transferred to fardale when chip was

there for a christmas vacation and
rhoda was at mrs winfields with nel-
lie stanley over the christmas holi-
days

  the realfs lived in cambridge and
kess recalled that once at least chip
had gone there presumably to see
rhoda and now apparently just be-
cause another girl had come on the
scene that pleasant affair was ended
or was it ended kess did not know

  nodt for me idt vouldt nodt he
thought i haf more sfav-bility budt
uff gourse vhen i fall in lofe mit dot
girl vhich she iss really a poy-

  though the flare of a quarrel was
over the talk was still going on and
he laid his ear to the floor to give close
heed to it

  carson iss back down so kvick dhere
vill be no fighdt he knows he musdt
be nice to gedt money oudt uff dot vel-
ler so now vot iss nexdt

  robert realf was with that coterie
kess believed for the reason that on
his previous visit to fardale he had
been an out-and-out and violent enemy
to chip merriwell

  the conversation at first was ram-
bling there was so much smoking that
soon the air was heavy and dense now
and then there was a clinking of glasses
dickey entered occasionally but did not
tarry though it was late he had to
be out in front presiding over his cigar
counter

  it was so apparent that these fellows
had gathered solely for the sake of con-
viviality and the tang of adventure
which was a part of these forbidden
visits to dickeys that kess was dis-
appointed he seemed to be wasting
his time and taking a risk for nothing
and the touch of that man against the
wall behind him with the belief that
he was the hindu murderer armed and
deadly was not soothing villum
wanted to scramble forth and announce
loudly that the hindu was there and
was afraid to do it

  he became interested again when the
talk dealt with affairs at the fardale
school these things could not be
touched without bringing in chip and
his friends kess glowed with indig-
nation as he listened

  oh chip is merely showing a sam-
ple of the merriwell jealousy said the
duke until kadir dhin came he
was gunns pet and it hurts him to
lose that place

  thats the whole history of the
merriwells at fardale said another
theyve got to run things when they
cant use a man they try to break him
their friends are idiots like clancy and
kess who are always willing to praise
everything they do im sick of it
kess began to breathe so heavily that
he was in danger of being heard when
by pressing his face hard against the
floor he tried to see the face of the
speaker

  idts yoost avery he tondt
coundt

  bronson avery was notorious as the
dukes echo he too had come from
brightwood the year before with the
duke hence with the older students
they were hardly considered true far-
dale men

  the miscellaneous gabble filled with
envious little stabs at fellows they did
not like brought in chip merriwell in-
evitably and led slowly up to a dis-
cussion of means to get even with chip
or block and thwart him the real bit-
terness of the speakers came forth
they were wild to take chip down and
desperate as to the means to be adopted

  it seems to me donchuknow
drawled the duke that we can easily
go farther by which i mean things
have turned out so that we can drive
him from fardale

  uh-huh so dot you can be der
headt uff der adledtic pitzness villum
grumbled so recklessly in his anger that
if there had not been a good deal of
moving about and noise in the room

he would have been heard you
skink dot iss alvays vot you tink uff
since you haf gome here

  colonel gunn said the duke is
beginning to get merriwells right
measure he sees that merriwell is
trying to ruin kadir dhin simply be-
cause kadir dhin refused to be walked
on by that crowd the whole thing
started you remember when kess in-
sultingly shouldered into kadir dhin
and our friend here resented it and
tried to teach the dutchman that he
couldnt carry off a thing like that
and chip you know backing his chum
proceeded to knock kadir dhin down
right there its the merriwell way
dont you know now lies trying to
ruin kadir dhin

  thats right carson said ive
had experience even though i aint in
fardale i went to jail once through
chips blabbin and if he could a done
it hed a sent me to the penitentiary
of course ive got to keep on the right
side o the law but id like to hit him
hard

  you came back at him rather hand-
somely donchuknow said the duke
with an air of pleasing condescension
but the way it ended it only gave him
a chance to make the claim that our
friend kadir dhin is standing in with
this mysterious hindu who is said to
be round here and who is cutting up
such queer pranks donchuknow that
its hard work to believe in them

  hes been saying something new
about me kadir dhin said flaming

  he says im told that this hindu-
if the rascal really exists and is your
uncle i beg your pardon-he says the
hindu couldnt have got hold of a far-
dale uniform if you hadnt assisted
him and that he couldnt have pulled
off that trunk trick either without your
aid

  the tense look that had come to the
face of kadir dhin softened and lie
relaxed his strained attitude and
frank merriwell jr at fardale



dropped back into his chair for an
instant it seemed an explosion would
come but all he said in a weak voice
was

  oh well let him talk the more
he talks against me the more he will
hurt himself with colonel gunn its
known everywhere that the barracks
have been burglarized and uniforms
stolen

  by careful work we can create a
prejudice against him among the stu-
dents who do not like his high-and-
mighty ways donchuknow the duke
urged and among those who will be
inclined to sympathize with kadir
dhin we can also put through some
scheme to blacken him so in the eyes
of colonel gunn that he will be thrown
out of fardale

  thats right said avery gunn
is sore on him on account of what has
happened to kadir dhin remember
and that feeling can be increased
what is this plan growled car-
son put it on exhibition

  the duke laughed softly he could
be very pleasant when he dropped his
stilted manners and his air of supe-
riority

  a thought has just come to me-
it had been in his mind all day-that
if you want to make sure that chip
merriwell goes out of fardale it can
be worked by kadir dhin he is quite

a hypnotist-

  i do very little at it-know very
little about it kadir dhin hastily cor-
rected

  the duke laughed again and lifted
his eyebrows in disbelief

  gunn told me that this uncle of
yours who slew miss maitlands father
in france was a wonderful hypnotist
and more than once you have given
little exhibitions to amuse the fellows
showing that you have that power to
a certain degree

  im a mere amateur said kadir
dhin

  but you could put this over donchu-
know im sure and it would be a
deathblow to merriwell get him into
conversation in some quiet place and
so get hypnotic control of him this
should be in the evening then stain
his face to the hue of yours and send
him sneaking into colonel gunns under
instructions to try to kidnap rose mait-
land hypnotized he would obey you
and he would not remember that you
had ever even spoken to him about it
colonel gunn could be posted tipped
off to the fact that merriwell was to
make this effort and that it was for
the purpose of damaging you kadir
dhin  lie could be made to think that
merriwell so disguised was putting a
fake attempt over against the girl and
intended to be seen so that you would
be accused of it

  suppose that colonel gunn caught
chip merriwell trying to do a thing
like that what

  wow rumbled carson

  he would last at fardale just as
long as a snowball in august it could
be made to appear that these other ef-
forts against the young lady had been
made by merriwell to ruin the reputa-
tion of kadir dhin some scheme
eh

  but kadir dhin did not rise to it
im only an amateur he said i
couldnt do it

  well i didnt know said the duke
smoothly but you can see how it
would finish merriwell his excuses
that he didnt know what he was doing
wouldnt go if gunn were primed in
advance to expect him

  why dont you get up a plan to beat
him to pieces said carson expressing
the bruiser in him fix it sos the
blamell be  him and then when he
makes the crack youve planned for
sail in and jest put him to sleep then
youve got your excuse ready and what
can be done about it he was the
aggressor


wide-awake magazine

  same old carson commented the
duke always seeing blood but that
wouldnt get him out of fardale
you see said avery trying to
back the duke just putting him down
for a few days or so wouldnt do hed
get over it and come back and still be
cock of the walk here thats what the
duke means

  ill say what i mean avery the
duke snapped i didnt mean that
we simply want to get rid of the mer-
riwell influence at fardale

  avery collapsed

  i understand he said i beg your
pardon

  kess hardly heard carsons words
he was thinking so intensely of the
queer plan which the duke had un-
folded for kadir dhin

  uh-huh dot vos saidt for two
ears more der two ears uff der hindu
who iss pehindt me der duke iss
schmardt he iss know der hindu is
in here idt vill gif dot hindu-ouch
his knees iss now digging in my back

he vill hypnotize my friendt chip unt

to fighdt dot hindu who iss behint me
to-night and cabture him unt stob der
whole pitzness before idt sdarts i
am glad i haf came unt i am vishing
dot i tidnt

  another plan that has just come to
me said the duke though he had
thought it out earlier is to queer mer-
riwell with gunn by getting him intoxi-
cated two or three times the fellow
has either been jagged or drugged-he
claimed he was drugged and if this
is worked right gunn can be made to
believe that he was drinking at those
other times

  you could work that trick bully
if youd undertake it donchuknow  and
you could pay off some of those
grudges hire a couple of fellows you
know the kind to take merriwell down

to the pavilion hand them a bottle of
liquor and tell them theyll be well
paid for forcing him to drink it when
hes good and soused let gunn know
about it and see him in that fix eh
carson 

  carsons eyes began to shine

  id as soon do it myself as not
he boasted spose he claimed after-
ward that i made him drink it would
anybody believe him 

  the duke smiled indulgently

  youre rather in the heavyweight
class i admit but could you do it
alone merriwell is some scrapper if
you try it youd better have some com-
petent help handy the best plan is
to send others to do it and keep out of
sight yourself

  but nothing seemed to materialize
the duke had as many plans as he had
fingers but always there was some-
thing usually a question of the risk
which kept them from full acceptance -
i guess there isnt any one here with
nerve enough to go up against merri-
well he said ill have to under-
take something myself

  oh you foxy granpa kess was
thinking you know dot you ar-re
delling der veller under here mit me all

a lively adventure

kess tog fighdt wasnt up to
his expectations either in its
manner or in its finish

  an interminable time passed before
anything occurred and then villum had
to start it the room was vacated the
lights were out and it was deathly cold
dickey had put up his shutters locked
his doors and had gone home the
time was wearing on toward morning
and still the man behind kess under
frank merriwell jr at fardale 

the cot lay there with no more move-
ment than if lie had died or had been
turned to stone

  villum crawled out at last in des-
peration he had long been expecting
a knife in his back or a revolver shot

  yoost der same i know you uff you
tondt sbeak idt lie announced i haf
got a rewolver vot iss full uff bullets
to idts neck unt uff you shoodt me i
vill shoodt you likevise undil you ar-re
deadt so you come oudt uff idt
kvick

  when the man did not come out
nor move nor speak yillum solemnly
scratched a match on his trousers and
flung it flaming under the cot at the
imminent risk of setting the cot and the
house on fire

  the instant dying out of the match
was followed by an earthquake the
light cot rose violently in air and
whirling over it fell on villum bring-
ing him to the floor in a smother of
bed clothing

  while he struggled to throw off the
bed coverings and mattress villum
heard the man unbar and fling aside a
shutter and smash a window  they were
resounding crashes and the breaking
of the window was accompanied by a
tinkling fall of glass

  yillum had rammed one foot through
the wire mesh of the bed springs and
felt like a wolf in a trap but he scram-
bled toward the window where he now
saw the starlight and the man climbing
up to escape villum was dragging the
bed springs with him and the greater
part of the coverings of the cot

  no you tondt escabe me he cried
and made a sweeping reach with his
hands

  though he was thrown down by the
dragging weight of the bed springs he
clutched the man by the coat tails and
when in his desperation the man flung
himself through to the ground one of
the tails of his coat remained in vil-
lums hands

a

  compelled to free his foot before he
could do more villum began a furious
light with the bed springs and bythis
he was so delayed that when he too
was ready to scramble out through the
broken window the man was a hundred
yards off running through the dark-
ness of the night

  but kess picked himself up pluckily
after his tumble and started in hot pur-
suit  and forgetting that explanations
would be demanded and would be awk-
ward to give he began at the same time
to bellow for help

  as lie thus plunged along in wild
chase villum saw another figure ap-
pear beyond the street corner there
was a loud demand  the fleeing man
to halt

  stop right where ye be im the
constable  stop i tell yeou

  the man whirled about and lifted his
hand there was a pistol report and a
flash of fire

  it was the constable who stopped
though the bullet had not touched him
and the man went  running faster
than ever

  the sight of the constable and that
revolver play put the thought of dis-
cretion into villums wild head he
swung about as the man made off and
sprinted for the cover of the darkness
by dickeys

  gale the constable stood hesitating
here were two escaping burglars as
he supposed both armed and in a shoot-
ing mood while the constable hesi-
tated kess got the house between him-
self and gale and flung wildly ahead
for the protecting darkness beyond

  villum ran down the length of the
parade ground then veered toward the
lake reflecting that he was making
telltale tracks he turned off to the
beaten road along which he continued
his flight he ran until he could run
no longer

 yiminy he panted when he
stopped i am deadt vunce in der

villum kept going until he reached
the boathouse crawling under its lee
and making sure no one was around
he struck another match and took a
look at the coat tail he had appropri-
ated

  about daylight kess made his way
into the village where he sought shelter
with a german friend to whom he
made suitable though false explana-
tions there he had breakfast after
he had had a few winks of sleep as
the german did not mention the break
at dickeys kess concluded it had not
yet been noised around

  villum found not much difficulty in
smuggling himself without attracting
attention into the fardale buildings
when the proper time came he made
his way up to chips room

  he burst in on chip and clancy
waving the tail of the coat as if it were
a banner of victory

  yoost seen dot he said i haf

ory that the man who had been under

incredible

rose and rhoda

that burglars had broken into
dickeys but had been fright-
ened away by the constable was
the story that got over town gale
was heard bragging of how cour-
ageously he had acted in scaring them
off and how one of the burglars hard
pressed had shot at him

  chip merriwell and his friends kept
their own counsel as the days passed
frank merriwell jr at fardale 

thgy watched for the hindu and
watched kadir dhin if the fussy and
important constable were to be be-
lieved other burglarious attempts had
been forestalled by him and he was as
busy as a man with five hands

  the normal routine of the academy
was for a time outwardly unbroken
study and lectures winter sports work
and play in the gymnasium went on as
usual under the rather rigid semimili-
tary discipline which gunn and the fac-
ulty enforced

  but it could be seen that the duke
and his friends were hard at work lin-
ing up against chip merriwell every
man they could the apparent result
was small chip had a host of friends
who were disposed to stand by him loy-
ally and of that closer and more in-
timate band consisting of such fellows
as clan and kess jelliby and others
that they would stand by chip through
thick and thin on any and every occa-
sion was of course known to every
one

  some hockey matches on the cleared
ice of the lake were exciting enough
to thrill the whole school and bring a
mob of spectators out from the village
twice chip led scrub teams against the
regular fardale team once going to
victory and another time to defeat

  that rhoda realf and her brother
were at fardale chip knew from kess
report and it was not long before he
met them chilled a bit by rose mait-
lands championship of kadir dhin
chip was in a mood to be moved again
by the beauty and charm of the younger
and slighter girl

  yet having a good memory chip
could not forget even while he was out
on the lake in the full swing of enjoy-
ment skating with rhoda realf that
whatever break there had ever been be-
tween them had been produced solely
because he could not endure the insuf-
ferable qualities of rhodas brother

  but when chip went over to gunns

for a talk with rose maitland on the
subject which was constantly in her
mind-her fears of the hindu who had
slain her father and who was believed
by herself and gunn to be in conceal-
ment at fardale-the feeling again
mastered him which had swayed him
when he first saw her

  t could wish you were an amer-
ican he said as he talked and jested
with her and i dont say that because
i hold any feeling whatever against the
english now  have offended im
sure i didnt intend it and beg your
pardon

  she had flushed but a slight height-
ening of the color in her cheeks made
her only the more charming

  its no offense she said you
see how can it be when i am half
american i didnt know but colonel
gunn had told you my mother was
an american from baltimore that is
why i was so willing to come to amer-
ica and  mean to visit baltimore as
soon as i can

  from this agreeable topic the talk
switched to the hindu and kadir dhin
a change inevitable as that had been
chips reason or excuse for making
this call

  colonel gunn is sure that gunga
singh the man who slew my father
is still here and that he is committing
these burglaries she reported colo-
nel gunn believes he has found refuge
with some of the low foreigners in the
mill sections and is burglarizing that
he may have money to pay for conceal-
ment he says too that dickey would
keep him would keep any scoundrel
for money i feel as if i were sitting
on a volcano i dont go out any more

  then she spoke again of kadir dhin
declaring that it was too bad the young
hindus career at fardale had been
shadowed as it was

  she added

  it has come to colonel gunn and
he resents it that you have been hint-


wide-awake magazine

ing that perhaps kadir dhin isnt so
innocent as he seems-that he has been
helping gunga singh

  chip had more than hinted that to
his friends-but only to his friends
and he had believed it he thought he
had reasons for believing it

  somebody must be a mind reader
he said

  you didnt say it

  i said it to clancy and kess and
perhaps one or two more

  so it wouldnt need mind reading
to get out you have wronged kadir
dhin i wish you would apologize to
him you havent apologized to him
no-not yet said chip i may
in time

  chip parried this subject off as well
as he could he was again too much in
love with this girl to want anything like
disagreement to come between them
yet he was in no mood to apologize to
the young hindu his belief was grow-
ing that kadir dhin was tricky that
he was imposing on the confidence of
colonel gunn and rose maitland he
wanted proof of it and meant to try
to get it so how could he go to kadir
dhin and say to the young hindu that
he thought he had wronged and was
wronging him it had to be parried
off it was a dangerous subject

  there were ever so many pleasanter
things to talk about and chip contrived
to bring them forward so that when
he took his leave it was with a sense
of having had a pleasant time and of
having made a good impression

  i wonder if i am fickle-minded
he thought as he walked away his mind
turning to rhoda realf no  dont
think i am i like rhoda-shes fine

but rose maitland-

  then he thought of kadir dhin

  i cant get it out of my nut that he
is playing a double game of course
if he isnt and t see that he isnt ill
apologize to him and do it freely
though im afraid i can never like him

chapter xiv

when the plot went wrong

dear me  dear me said colonel
gunn twisting his glasses about
on his nose as he stared in as-
tonishment at the crumpled note which
had been brought to him by the servant
girl

  the colonel had arrived at home late
having remained at the academy look-
ing over some examination papers

  this is what his eyes rested on and
why he exclaimed and stared 

  colonel gunn  the scandalous doings of
some of your students is the limit they
drink and gamble right under your nose and
you dont know it i f you want proof go
down to the pavilion right now you will
find chip merriwell there intoxicated so
much so that he cant get back to the bar-
racks there has been a drinking bout down
there which has lasted ever since fardale
let out its students for the day when the
others left the pavilion they had to leave
merriwell there because he couldnt walk
you ought to know about this

a fardale well-wisher

  colonel gunn did not like anonymous
communications but here was some-
thing he could not overlook it called
for attention and action

  he rang for the servant

  mary he said his voice hoarse and
shaky will you-er-be kind enough
to inform me where you-ahum-got
this singular note which you brought
me 

  at the dure said mary a by
brought it he said it was fer you and
im sure yere name was on it

 my name was on it-very true
ahem-you did not recognize the boy

  i niver saw his face befure

 ahum-thank you mary if you
will help me  with my greatcoat i
-ahum-

  mary helped him get into his over-
coat  and with his cane in hand colo-
nel gunn sallied forth the unpleas-
ant note was in his pocket

a-er-a distressing thing he
frank merriwell jr at fardale



was thinking until recently i have
thought so well of young merriwell
 fear he will never be the man his
father was dear me the pranks that
fellow used to cut here he too was
quite wild nevertheless there was a
saving grace in him  a-er-thought-
fulness i was younger then too and
my dear father zenas gunn of blessed
memory-yes the older merriwell an-
noyed him a great deal

  the night was falling and the early
lights of the village were shining there
were no lights to-night on the lake
unless carried by some skater and
gunns way lay in that direction along
the lake to the pavilion

  the colonel reflected that he ought to
have company and was on the point of
turning aside and telephoning for the
constable but was deterred by the
thought that he ought not to expose a
student in that way even though the
student deserved exposure

  by going alone i may be able to
prevent a scandal yet-er-of course
mr merriwell will have to leave the
academy i-ahum-see no other way
i shall write to his father a full ex-
planation  tell him that recently there
has-er-been a great change in his
son i shall have to speak of this vio-
lent animosity against the youth kadir
dhin who came here as a foreigner
and stranger under-er-my protec-
tion such base calumnies as kadir
dhin assures me young merriwell has
heaped on him-there is even an ele-
ment of insanity in it is the whole
world going mad

  the worthy head of fardale grew
warm with indignation as he stumped
along prodding the snow angrily with
his walking stick

  as for gunga singh kadir dhin
thinks that the money i have been fur-
nishing him for the purpose of hiring
men to hunt down that hindu murderer
will soon bring results i-ahum-i
hope so i hope so it is growing

very expensive if results are not at-
tained soon i shall-ahum-be com-
pelled to desist in making further ad-
vances a terrible state of affairs
and the-er-constable makes no prog-
ress

  his mind turned back to chip merri-
well

  a drinking bout of fardale students
down at the pavilion and mr merri-
well left there in so beastly a state of
intoxication that he cannot even walk
dreadful

  a merry jingling of sleigh bells
reached him as he approached the lake
in the road which turned there and
passed along the lakeside toward the
pavilion the sleigh was coming up be-
hind him and it seemed that gunn
would be run down by the horses

  he gave a skipping jump which must
have surprised him and landed in the
snow at the side of the road

  ahum  dear me how very reck-
less  a lot of hoodlums from the vil-
lage no doubt and very probably
intoxicated what is the-er-world
coming to 

  then the colonel discovered that the
sleigh was filled with young fellows
who were nearly all of them in the
fardale uniform they had been
laughing but they drew up beside him
and fell silent with respect

  this show of deference pleased him
he was especially gratified when he saw
their hands go up in the military salute

  are you going far colonel gunn
he was asked with politeness

  ahum er-that is to say-

  they were leaping out of the sleigh
surrounding him

  we arc out for a drive down the
road here beautiful night isnt it if
youre going far we offer you a seat
in with us the sleighing is delightful
it will honor us

  colonel gunn was flattered and flus-
tered

 i was-er-


wide-awake magazine

  then right in here is a good seat
were going to drive down by the pa-
vilion and beyond and then back to
fardale by the other road it will be a
lovely ride

  they had him by the arms still try-
ing to be courteous though in reality
they had literally taken possession of
him and before the colonel could say
whether he wished to go in the sleigh
or did not wish to he was in it sinking
back in the seat

 er-er- ahaw-ahum  this is

aw-  have lost my stick in the

snow there  believe

  it was rescued and passed up to him
the young fellows were climbing in
beside and behind him and to keep him
from wanting to get out the driver
quietly touched up the horses and sent
them dancing along jingling their bells

 ahaw-ahum  i-er-

  gunn looked around him

  in the faint light he recognized his
companions he saw bronson avery
clearly for bronson sat beside him and
had been one of the politest behind
him he heard familiar voices he was
displeased on discovering one of the
voices to be bully carsons he de-
tested and suspected carson

  i shall have to speak to these boys
about carson he thought as he tried
to get a grip on his scattered faculties

  ahum he coughed and touched
the driver on the arm i shall-er-
be obliged if you will put me off in the
road near the-er-the pavilion from
there i shall-er-walk back this is
-er-very pleasant but on a night like
this-so glorious-i prefer to walk so

if you er-

  oh well put you off at the pa-
vilion was the significant statement
with which he was reassured

  but when the road by the ice was
reached the fellows in the sleigh with
gunn were given a surprise that was as
great as gunns

  chip merriwell skating on the ice
there with clan and kess and some
others had stopped at the edge of the
ice curious to see the sleigh go by not
dreaming who its occupants were

  chip was recognized by the fellows
in the sleigh and by the driver who
gave a little ejaculation of amazement
and drew hard on the reins bringing
the horses to a stop

  merriwell  he said gasping the
name

  gunn electrified craned his neck
and chip thinking himself addressed
stepped into the road walking on his
skates toward the sleigh

  it is-er-it is mr merriwell
gunn exploded this-er-this is
you mr merriwell

  chip saluted and clan and the
others coming up behind him repeated
the action

  yes sir said chip

  but you-er-were-that is to say
can it-

  yes sir

  colonel gunn tumbled out of the
sleigh-almost fell out-in his amaze-
ment lie hooked his glasses on his
nose and stared at chip he saw that
chip was steady-limbed clear-eyed and
sober

  hello one of the fellows ex-
claimed suddenly with a startled em-
phasis that drew attention whats
that mean the pavilions on fire

  a flame had flashed from a window
in the lakeside building some distance
down the road and by the light of it
two men were seen running away over
the snow

chapter xv

cowardice and heroism

the two men who sat at the table
in the front room overlooking
the icy lake were as sinister a
pair as bully carson could have picked
up anywhere and they were not dis-
frank merriwell jr at fardale

posed to heed the young fellow who lay
bound on the floor by the door

  les carry him upstairs bill and
shet him in that back room where he
cant make himself heard by anybody
passin long the road we either got
to do that or gag him

  but-see here youre making an
awful mistake donchuknow im not
the fellow you were told to get donchu-
know this is a hideous mistake fel-
lows

  it was the duke who was making this
piteous appeal

  but he had little hope that it would
be heeded since up to this time he had
not been listened to and had been given
such shameful treatment moreover
there was small hope that he would be
rescued soon by his friends the pa-
vilion had been chosen by him because
he knew it was far down the lake and
isolated

  it was a lakeside place of entertain-
ment unoccupied in the winter as a
rule the previous winter the duke
had hired it and it was understood he
had some sort of occupancy claim on
it this winter

  the men were still disposed to be
rough with him

  weve heard all we want out of
you he was told so shet up you
was pointed out to us plain

  by bully carson

  no matter about that here bill
well put him upstairs either that or
we got to gag him

  they took him upstairs and locked
him in the little room just as he was
then they went back to the lower room
with its table itspack of cards and the
bottle of whisky that was on it

  that whisky had been furnished by
bully carson and their prisoner ac-
cording to carsons directions was to
be drugged with it but they liked the
taste and smell of the liquor too wrell
to waste it in that way they meant to
drink it themselves

  sitting down at the table again they
sampled the- contents of the bottle and
applied themselves to the cards the day
was at its close and they fancied them-
selves in the greatest security for an
hour or more

  acting up to bully carsons instruc-
tions they had waylaid the fardale
cadet as he came swinging up the lake
on his skates not long before they
thought they knew him carson had
pointed him out to them so they were
sure there was no mistake even when
he declared there was

  they had made their mistake natu-
rally the duke had been standing
close by chip merriwell on a street
corner when carson had indicated the
latter they had simply looked at the
wrong man when carson was talking

  they knew what was expected of
them when they had forced intoxica-
tion on their prisoner they were to
depart and leave him in the pavilion
to be seen there by colonel gunn and
any others who chanced to be with the
colonel

  they found the cards interesting and
the liquor more so they had not in-
tended to light the lamp they found on
the table but decided to do so when
their caution became less active they
couldnt see to play without a light and
stakes were then on the table

  how long they played they did not
know but they went very speedily to
the bottom of the liquor bottle they
began to quarrel each accusing the
other of cheating drawing a knife
one lunged at the other with it across
the table the other rose and flung back
to avoid the blow

  the table was overturned with a
crash and the lamp went to the floor
it shattered and the kerosene caught
from the burning wick in a moment
the room was filled with flames

  stunned for an instant by what
threatened they made a feeble attempt


wide-awake magazine

to fight out the fire then they threw
open the door and running out into the
road they fled

  in the froom into which he had been
flung the duke had been trying to get
the cords off his wrists he was in a
vile temper he piled anathemas on
bully carson and on the men down-
stairs if carson had not been a fool
and chosen fools for this work this
mistake could not have been made he
had planned it and given carson the
money to carry it out and this was
the result he had come skating down
the lake wondering how near he could
be to the pavilion and be safe when the
trick was pulled off and the ruffians
had seized him instead of the one
chosen who was chip merriwell

  the treatment he was receiving was
meant for chip

  what made his fate more bitter was
his belief that there had been a clever
turning against him of the tables he
thought the ruffians had been tampered
with by chip after carson had hired
them and that this was done deliber-
ately by them for pay so he heaped
his curses on chip as well as on carson
and the two stupid fools

  then came the fire and the terror it
conveyed to the occupant of the upper
room

  he heard the quarreling below then
the crashing of the overturned table
and the yells of the men when they
tried to stay the fire he heard them
throw the door open and run away like
the cowards they were forgetful of him
and of his fate

  the duke screamed with fear when
he heard them go

  for a moment the terror of his situ-
ation almost overcame him  he felt sick
and faint his heart pounded up until
it seemed almost in his throat a pan-
icky fear clouded his mind

  this passed there was some cour-
ageous fiber in the duke he had been

spoiled in his training he was always
made to think he was finer and better
than any one else was always petted
and flattered and constantly treated by
servants and even friends as if he were
a superior being if there had not been
some good stuff in the duke he would
have been far worse than he was at
present

  as soon as he could control his jump-
ing nerves the duke tried again to get
free of the cords that held his wrists
but he could not do it he could not
break the cords and struggling only
drew the knots tighter

  rolling over against the door he
drew up his legs and began to dash his
heels against the panels trying to break
through

  the fire was roaring so that he could
lear it plainly when he was not making
too much noise and the smoke that had
begun to creep through the rooms
readied him

  help he screamed as he ham-
mered with his heels against the door
help help

  that some one passing in the road
well out beyond might hear him was
his hope he was beginning to hope
too that the fire would be seen in the
village in time for fire fighters to get
out to it before it had made a finish
of him

  as if in answer to his calls he soon
heard the jingling approach of a sleigh
and from the sound of the bells he could
tell that the horses were galloping

  the fire had reached the stairway
which led to the room where the duke
lay he could see under the door the
fiery licking of red tongues of flame
as gusts of air drove the flames higher
and now the smoke getting into his
room more and more was troublesome
and threatened soon to be suffocating

  he was yelling himself hoarse bawl-
ing for help to the occupants of the
sleigh when he heard them shouting
frank merriwell jr at fardale 

to each other outside in the snow his
screams to attract their attention be-
came screeches

  lie had been heard he could soon
tell that

  at the same time it was being said
that  one could get up to the second
floor there were no ladders to be had
and the stairs were on fire

  some one jingled away in the sleigh
going to the village to get ladders the
others it seemed were waiting for the
ladders or for the coming of the far-
dale fire department

  the duke knew that before the slow-
moving local fire department could get
there or the sleigh return with ladders
he would be beyond the need of aid

  help he screamed

  his feet flailing could not shatter
the stout panels of the door

  a little later when the hot breath
of the fire seemed trying to reach
through the door to him he heard a
voice it was followed by a crash that
drove the door inward

  chip merriwell head and shoulders
wrapped round with a sleigh robe
soaked in melted snow groped into the
room he had come through the fire-
filled stairway with it round him he
had dared the fury of the flames to
reach and help the duke when carson
and avery and all the dukes own fol-
lowers refused the risk claiming that
whoever tried it would be burned to
death the stairs were like a furnace

  theres the hall yet chip gasped
here

  my feet and hands are tied the
duke shouted

  chip got his knife out and cut the
cords

  here he panted can you walk

ill help you pull your coat up around
your head the hall here is free yet
and we can reach one of the windows

  its merriwell said the duke
bewildered

  he had been thinking chip had sent
him there and he wondered about this
yet it was dull wonder and a very ac-
tive thankfulness no one rejects the
hand that is stretched out to save

  he did not need chips aid  he even
scrambled ahead along the hall driven
by fear and he was at one of the win-
dows smashing it when chip came up
he was about to throw himself out
through the window

 no said chip we can take
time were safe now unless the house
falls the fire is following but were
well ahead of it here ive got the driv-
ing lines from the sleigh for ropes

  he pushed the duke through after
passing a length of the leather reins
around the dukes body under his
arms and hung to the loops he had set
while the duke slid downward to the
ground

  securing the lines to the support of
a wall bracket chip merriwell fol-
lowed and dropped but the sleigh robe
and his clothing smoked from the heat

  burned much chip some one was
asking as he reeled into the arms that
were stretched out to assist him

  no he gasped i-i think not i
think im all right

  well it sure was close you didnt
have much time the old pavilion is
going

  ten minutes later it was a flaming
tinder box with a tornadolike roar as
the fire drove skyward and a glare that
reddened the snow for great distances
around

chapter xii
tightening up

lose beside his tiny signal
  fire denis waited there in
  the night as he watched
  he remembered one thing
  to which he had given lit-
  tle thought

   this was that cowley
was going to the foot of
the lakes some time that same night to
meet dray presumably cowley would
not start until an hour or so before
dawn but what would happen when
he reached the foot of the lake

hell take ballards camp fire for
that of bray mused denis frowning

when he gets close up liell discover
his mistake and put for home then
ill be there to nab him-if nothing hap-
pens well no use gathering trouble
till the time comes

  perhaps half an hour later denis
sighted a dark blur on the lake and
heard a low hail he flung a few scraps
of birch bark on the fire allowed them
to blaze up until he himself was fully
revealed then he stamped out the fire
and scattered it

  waiting at the edge of ti shore lie
presently saw two craft come gliding
in the first was napoleons dugout
with napoleon himself wielding his
clumsy paddle towing after this was
trooper stewart substitute



he light canoe which denis had left at
the head of the lake on his unfortunate
attempt to arrest cowley

  bjou came the half-breeds voice
i got heem what you do dat man
bray huh

  i took care of him all right said
denis smiling hes gone back to
fort vermilion and youll find your
camp waiting as you left it when
youre at the fort go in to brays store
and hell settle with you for whatever
grub he used

  the breed grunted deep satisfaction
at this information denis pulled in the
canoe to his delight he found his
duffel bag blankets and the rifle ex-
actly as he had left them

  mebbeso you make for pay sug-
gested napoleon diffidently

  denis reflected

  the man bray sent you to find-the
man named cowley-has a camp half-
way up this shore he returned im
going to arrest him also a breed
named petwanisip cowley has some
fine pelts up there and you can have
your pick want to come along

  this did not strike napoleons fancy
mebbeso i come back im want
for sleep now he said which was a lie
since he had probably slept all the pre-
ceding afternoon after reaching the
head of the lake huh mebbeso i
come back dere to-morrow

  denis chuckled

  theres a bunch of four white men
down at the foot of the lake be re-
joined they have rifles and theyll

be up here to-morrow-

  that was enough for napoleon who
grunted deep

  mebbeso i go way quick whatever
got um pain in belly want for sleep
mebbeso i come back mebbeso not
whatcheer

  he edged his dugout toward the lake
shadows denis laughed glad to be rid
of the fellow who would be of no use
in a fight

  run along then poleoii you
come back to-morrow afternoon and
the coast will be clear  think then
ill pay you-and pay you pretty well
too dont come later than that but
come then sure sure

  huh sure  was the answer na-
poleon would keep his word also-to
the police

  denis watched the dark slim shape
of the dugour float out into the night
and disappear into a speck under the
starlight then he turned to his own
canoe and with a feeling of deep re-
lief knelt once more on his blankets
and took up his paddle the rifle ready
to hand ballards canoe he left on the
bank

  to land at cowleys creek about
dawn would be time enough for his
purposes he could let cowley go to
the foot of the lake-probably to return
faster than he had gone in the mean-
time he could arrest smoking duck and
make an investigation

  that was an important point-the
investigation besides the original
charge against cowley and that of re-
sisting arrest the police must know
what the man was doing here how he
had gained possession of so much fur
and just what kind of an illegal game
was forward it might be that he was
simply dealing out whisky without a
permit which was in itself a grave of-
fense in a land where the vanishing in-
dians are protected by laws of iron
against such men as cowley

  with ten miles to travel against a
steadily increasing headwind and three
hours in which to cover it denis fell
into a steady even stroke that he could
keep up for days on end if need were
keeping close to shore he worked his
way gradually along up the lake notic-
ing a perceptible increase in the wind
as the night wore onward

  when the stars began to dim and die
and the grayness of dawn slowly lifted
the darkness denis ran to the beach
go

wide-awake magazine

and landed it was vital that he make
no mistake now and he must be sure
of his ground before going ahead

  for half an hour he lay on the bank
watching and waiting then an excla-
mation of satisfaction broke from him
through the lifting gray dawn light he
could discern the hills a half mile far-
ther along the shore where cowleys
camp was located sweeping the waters
of the lake with his eyes he then caught
a moving speck halfway across in line
between the hills and the foot of the
lake and moving toward the latter

  cowley was well  his way down the
lake

  looks as though things were break-
ing my way at last thought denis as
he scrambled down the steep bank to
his canoe now i think that ill have
a little surprise for mr smoking duck
before he gets through his breakfast

  save for the cartridges which the
pigeon had expended the winchester
rifle had a full magazine certain of
this denis pumped in a fresh cartridge
knelt in the canoe placed the rifle in
front of him and shoved out

  now he paddled swiftly putting all
his strength into the work i a short
fifteen minutes he found himself lying
outside the almost concealed creek en-
trance into this he headed scanning
the bushes and trees ahead for any sign
of smoking duck

  no danger threatened however
without sighting a moving thing he
reached the log landing jumped out
and lifted his canoe from the water
then rifle in hand he stepped out on
the trail to the shack

  five minutes later he was standing
at the edge of the clearing eying that
odd cluster of buildings from the
chimney of the shack itself  smoke
ascended but from what seemed to be
the lean-to just behind a thin trail of
wispy smoke was winding into the sky

  that must be the fire to which
cowley referred thought denis

frowning if smoking duck isnt
asleep hes probably around there in
back

  hesitating no longer he went across
the clearing at a run half expecting a
rifle shot from the silent shack front
none came reaching the door of the
shack he peered inside and found the
place empty but from the back came
the regular strokes of an ax

  slipping around the side wall of the
shack to the right denis passed the
lean-to which held the baled peltries
at the corner he paused cocking his
rifle then stepped out around the end

  a dozen feet away stood petwanisip
leaning on an ax even that cocking of
the rifle had attracted the half-breeds
attention denis covered the man in-
stantly

  hands up smoking duck

  smoking duck stared as if at an
apparition then he cast a wild glance
around and denis saw a rifle leaning
against the wall but it was three
yards distant and not even the des-
perate half-breed dared risk it his
hands rose slowly

  each lean-to adjoined the other here
at the back to the left of the rifle
was a low doorway near which smok-
ing duck had been throwing the wood
as he had cut it denis observed that
this was firewood

  go to the left of that door stand
with your face to the wall and stick
your hands out behind your back
commanded denis

  there was a snap to his voice that
spelled earnestness his brown face
convulsed with helpless rage the half-
breed did as denis had ordered ad-
vancing to the man denis stuck his
rifle in petwanisips back

  be mighty careful now-this gun
is cocked

  with one hand he unlaced his moc-
casins knotted the lacing and drew it
about the swarthy wrists then he set-
down his rifle and in a few seconds
trooper stewart substitute

g

had knotted the buckskin thongs
stoutly smoking duck was trapped
beyond escape

  walk around to the front of the
cabin

  driven by that relentless rifle the
sullen half-breed led the way around
the shack to the door denis ordered
him on inside and so to the same little
room where he himself had been con-
fined removing the fellows knife he
locked him in the inner room

  things are certainly coming fine
for me he reflected as from cowleys
stores he replaced his moccasin lacing
now well begin our investigations-
and id better start right here

  bens ross service rifle was in a rack
as was the revolver with its lanyard
denis gladly took back these weapons
and found cowleys revolver hanging
to a nail no other rifle was in evi-
dence however and he conjectured that
cowley had not gone forth unarmed
this however he had expected

  leaving smoking duck locked up
safely denis sallied forth on his tour
of inspection first he visited the lean-
to at the right and in this he found a
few sacks of corn together with sev-
eral sacks marked beans and pota-
toes a slash with his knife showed
that all these were filled with corn

  so cowley has been importing all
the corn he could under every disguise
possible thought denis looking down
at the sacks the question is why
in about two minutes your little game
will be up my friend

  as he closed the rude door of the
lean-to and stepped out into the early-
morning sunshine he paused suddenly
the night wind had died away the
morning was perfectly calm and clear
he stood motionless listening-and the
sound came again it was a distant but
still recognizable rifle crack a third
sounded instantly then two or three
shots came almost together after that
silence

  thats cowley and ballard
thought denis his blue eyes narrowing
if they havent got him hell be back
presently if they have-then its up
to me to arrest ballards crowd by
tasper i dont like this business a lit-
tle bit

  no further sounds of conflict reached
him while he could sympathize with
ballard and the latters friends he
knew perfectly well that he must arrest
them if they had killed cowley he
was representing big ben stewart and
his uniform typified the law and ben
would be held responsible for the up-
holding of the law

  frowning uneasily he passed on
around the corner of the log structure
and again came to where he had found
smoking duck at work pie stepped to
the doorway set down his rifle beside
that of the half-breed and entered the
mysterious lean-to

  this proved to be unlighted save by
the door and for a moment his eyes
could not pierce the semidarkness
then as he saw what manner of place
this was an exclamation of slow sur-
prise broke from his lips

  by jasper and to think that i
never even suspected it-and dad was
the closest guesser of all

  to either side of him were piled
small kegs and above these were neat
rows of glass half-pint flasks precisely
similar to that which he had found on
the person of the pigeon a few days
previously about half of them were
filled with a white liquid and the subtle
odor of whisky which pervaded the
room betrayed the nature of that liquid
but denis merely noted these things in
passing-his gaze was riveted on what
lay beyond across the room from him

  there with a small fire still burning
was a complicated arrangement of
metal which he did not understand at
all but whose usage was quite evident
to him he had seen pictures of stills
before this and knew at once that he


wide-awake magazine

had solved the mystery of cowleys
corn and trading and illegal work
every detail lay clear before him

 here on hay lake hundreds of
miles from anywhere cowley had lo-
cated a private whisky distillery from
fort vermilion to the summer hudson
bay post farther down the hay he
had brought up corn under various dis-
guises to avert possible suspicion and
had calmly proceeded to manufacture
his own whisky and trade it to the in-
dians in the neighborhood

  this is going the whisky-running
game one better all right  exclaimed
denis as he eyed the place well my
job is clear-so here goes 

  stepping outside he took up smok-
ing ducks ax and reentered first
drawing what was left of the fire and
carefully stamping it out he then
waded into the still ripping the copper
worm and everything else into useless
shreds of metal he did his work thor-
oughly and left nothing undestroyed

  then he turned his attention to the
kegs and bottles the latter he smashed
where they were the former he rolled
out into the yard ten of the kegs
were full of whisky and these he
smashed in and emptied satisfied at
length that the whole affair had been
destroyed with the exception of one
flask to be used as evidence if neces-
sary he wiped his dripping face and
took up the two rifles

  heres a good mornings work for
ben anyhow he muttered happily
now id better prepare my little re-
ception committee for mr cowley-or
ballard i wonder which will come

chapter xiii

cowley cries enough

from the front of the shack the
lake was of course hidden by the
intervening hill denis remem-
bered that the presence of his canoe
would warn cowley if the latter ar-

rived in flight from ballard and struck
off to the creek at a sharp trot

  once here he went on to the edge
of the lake and scrambled through the
bushes to a vantage point and here
his mental question was answered in-
stantly

  a scant quarter mile away was a
canoe bearing a single paddler-evi-
dently cowley the canoe was heading
for the creek entrance and was trav-
eling fast a mile or more behind it
was another canoe bearing four men
and for a moment denis eyed them
wondering why they did not catch up
with cowley then he laughed shortly

  overloaded by jasper all four
of em in her and she must be right
down to the water so they dont dare
put on speed this simplifies things for
me then

  so apparently it did since cowley
was coming squarely into the trap at
the moment it did not occur to denis
that ballards arrival might bring him
a new problem and the most difficult
one which he had yet faced

  returning to the log landing he
picked up his canoe and carried it a
dozen yards away placing it among the
bushes where the hurrying cowley
would never notice it this done he
made his way back to the shack

  with his ross rifle under his arm
he set the other weapons out of reach
in a corner a glitter on the floor
caught his eye and he stooped to pick
up the handcuffs which he had in-
tended to place on cowley and had
worn himself by the irony of circum-
stance he slipped them into his
pocket and opened the door of the
prison chamber

  smoking duck was sitting on the
floor in sour apathy his wrists as denis
had left them denis smiled cheerfully
at him

  i suppose you heard the sound of
wreckage my friend yes your little
game is up for good and all by the
trooper stewart substitute



way wheres the key of those hand-
cuffs i want to use them on your
precious partner pretty quick

  smoking duck glared up at him and
finally grunted out that the key was
lost

  so much the worse for cowley then
-hell have to reach headquarters be-
fore getting released from bondage i
see you still have some coffee on the
fire-want a hot cup thatll cheer but
not inebriate

  the scowling half-breed emitted a
flood of mingled cree and english
which denis rightly imagined to be a
profane refusal so he barred the door
and left smoking duck to his own re-
flections

  a pot of coffee stood on the tiny
fish-shanty stove and in a couple of
moments denis had a fire going for he
had not eaten since the previous even-
ing keeping one eye on the edge of
the clearing he swallowed some half-
warmed coffee and a cold sour-dough
biscuit-and looked out to see the figure
of cowley coming at a run rifle in
hand

  denis cocked his own rifle drew to
one side of the doorway and waited
on his way across the clearing cowley
let out a roar for smoking duck but
the half-breed had not the presence of
mind to call out a warning or else he
had not yet comprehended the full situ-
ation of affairs

  thus cowley came leaping into the
trap at sight of the mans brutal face
denis saw that he had been badly
frightened  but that would further his
own ends

  hands up-hurry

  that snappy curt command stopped
cowley as if shot he was looking
squarely into the muzzle of the ross
rifle

  for a moment he was paralyzed his
undershot jaw dropped in blank amaze-
ment and the ragged mustache drew
back from his yellow teeth in a snarl

over the rifle sights the blue eyes of
denis were blazing at him and with a
single curse cowley dropped his rifle
and lifted his hands as he did so he
took a backward step toward the door

  stop that snapped denis walk
this way and put out your hands wrists
together i mean business cowley and
youd better believe it

  cowley flung a hunted look over his
shoulder at the clearing then slowly
obeyed the command advancing toward
denis

  his heavy face showed mingled fear
bewilderment and fury but when
denis took the handcuffs from his
pocket cowley cried out sharply

  not that mister trooper-fer
gawds sake dont iron me theres

four fellers right after me-

  i know that said denis warily
and one of thems ballard the man
you cheated down on the peace river
your chickens are coming home to
roost with a vengeance eh stick out
your hands

  he held out the open handcuffs but
cowley breathing hoarsely drew back
in fear that was by no means assumed

  i tell ye theyre after me he re-
peated look-a-here dont lay me up
where i cant shoot ye fool them fel-
lers aims to murder me an i got to
handle a gun in about two minutes
youll handle no more guns for a
while denis was smiling slightly his
eyes steady bray has gone back to
vermilion and ive just had the pleas-
ure of smashing up your liquor stock
and distillery so you ran into ballard
eh  i heard some shots-what hap-
pened down there

  cowley made as if to wipe his drip-
ping brow but halted as denis finger
tightened on the trigger

  they seen me first an let drive i
dropped one o them-leastways i
winged him a bit then i shoved fer
home now use sense you aint
a-goin to fix me where theyll pump

lead into me without me gettin a chance
to shoot-

  shut up that nonsense broke in
denis youre not going to be hurt
unless you get gay with me if you
dont stick your hands here in ten sec-
onds im going to drop you with a bul-
let in your leg-take your choice

  lie meant the words for he saw that
the situation was grave in the extreme
cowley had shot one of the four pur-
suers and that meant trouble men of
ballards stamp would require tenfold
vengeance for that shot none the less
denis saw his duty clear-cut before
him and intended to protect his pris-
oner to the utmost

  with a growling snarl cowley ad-
vanced and held forth his hands wrists
together denis lifted the open hand-
cuffs in his left hand-and as he did
so cowley swiftly struck the rifle aside
and bore him down with a pantherlike
leap

  taken utterly by surprise denis
went back and the rifle was knocked
across the shack with a clatter cow-
leys fist drove home on his cheek
knocking him into the wall but as the
ruffian followed denis flung himself to
one side and scrambled up

  a fierce rush of anger swept from
his mind all thought of the revolver at
his belt and he went into the man with
both fists his blue eyes blazing he
landed right and left to the face then
went staggering away groaning as
cowleys heavy boot took him squarely
in the side cowley was after him with
a roar

  that foul kick infuriated denis as
nothing else had the power to madden
him and when the ruffian tried the
same tactics again his anger drove new
life into his veins disdaining to em-
ploy such tricks himself he lifted a
blow through the others guard that
went straight to the mouth and sent
cowley reeling back with broken teeth
on into him went denis placing blow

after blow his lips clenched in silent
fury and his fists beating a tattoo on the
mans face

  cowley lurched into the wall curs-
ing flung back met a smashing left
hook that rocked him on his heels and
then swung himself bodily into a clinch
at the same instant denis stepped into
a bearskin heaped loosely on the floor
endeavoring to get clear of cowleys
hug the bearskin tripped and brought
him down on the floor-underneath

  the breath was knocked out of denis
by the impact he lay gasping and help-
less while cowley above hit him twice
heavily then the ruffian gripped denis
by the throat in an effort at systematic
choking aware of his advantage with-
out pity he was deliberately trying to
get denis out of the way

  vainly and ineffectually denis struck
upward-a man flat on his back cannot
hit much of a blow cowley tore at
him with snarling oaths thegreat fin-
gers digging into his throat until it
seemed that his flesh was coming asun-
der his breath was stopped

  with all things going black and the
black changing to specks of fire that
danced through his brain a final co-
herent thought came to him it was the
recollection of his revolver

  his fumbling hands went to the lan-
yard in blind desperation even in that
moment denis fought against himself
he must not fire he must take cow-
ley alive he must bring in this man a
prisoner with that great thought
pounding against his brain denis pulled
out the gun and struck upward with it
wildly

  cowley caught the full effect of that
blow the fore sight of the revolver
took him just above the temple and
ripped to the bone again denis struck
out blindly and again the heavy re-
volver landed almost in the same place

  those two blows were enough denis
felt the terrible grip on his throat relax
and felt cowleys weight tumble away
trooper stewart substitute



from him little more than conscious
himself he rolled over and dragged
himself up by the logs of the wall

  he leaned against the wall hanging
on weakly and panting for breath
fighting against the terrible faintness
that oppressed him and threatened to
conquer his reeling brain that life-
and-death struggle had all but drowned
him

  gradually his sight cleared as air
returned to his gasping lungs there at
his feet lay cowley stretched out his
head bleeding denis first thought was
that he had struck too hard dropping
to his knees he breathed quick relief at
finding cowleys heart beating the
man was only stunned

  a glance at the clearing showed no
sign of ballards forces after all that
battle had taken only a few moments
though it had seemed an age to denis

  for a little he stood gazing down at
cowley while strength came back to
him and his throbbing lungs drank in
the sweet air to one side lay the
handcuffs where he had dropped them
picking them up he drew cowleys
wrists together and snapped the brace-
lets in place

  ive landed him at last he mut-
tered with a deep sigh of relief and
its a lucky thing for me that i made
sure of smoking duck first i cant
leave this fellow to bleed to death
though

  searching through cowleys pockets
he discovered a ragged bandanna
with this and his own handkerchief he
bandaged the mans bleeding scalp
roughly but effectively while doing
so cowleys eyelids fluttered then
opened

  lie still cautioned denis you
can get up in a minute

  cowley lifted his wrists saw the
handcuffs and relaxed with a low
growl when the bandaging was fin-
ished denis went to the door of the
smaller room and unbarred it smok-

csa

ing duck still reposed on the floor wide
awake and glaring like a trapped beast
denis turned to the watching cowley

  come along now and get in here
ballard may show up at any minute

and i want you off my hands-

  ballard

  cowley sat up fright stamped anew
in his coarse features

  ye aint goin to let em have me

mister trooper fer the love of-

  shut up snapped denis curtly
ballard and his friends wont lay a
finger on you ill promise you that
you join your friend and fellow citizen
in here and go to sleep ill attend to
the rest

  cowley looked at him into the
mans rough face crept a slow gleam
of admiration as he met the steady gaze
of denis

  mister ye sure are some man he
exclaimed ye got me-ye got me
proper and i give ye the best i had at
that i thought id slide out o here
with a good wad but ye sure played the
game hard no i reckon i got to take
my medcine now and i aint got any
kick cornin you blasted redcoat
with this grudging tribute to his con-
queror crowley lifted himself and stag-
gered into the smaller room sinking
down beside smoking duck denis
shut the door and dropped the heavy
bar into place

  the clearing was still empty of life
outside the shack sinking down on
one of the two bunks denis rested
his aching head in his hands

  the worst of the job is done he
thought unless-unless that lynching
party is after gore if they are it looks
to me as if theyll have to get it by
jasper i have cowley safe and i mean
to keep him

  he lifted his head at sound of a
distant shout then picking up his
ross rifle he laid it across his knees
and waited facing the doorway

       chapter xiv
       ballard shows fight

denis stewart was unutter-
ably weary both physically and
mentally

  he had been on a tremendous strain
for the past three days and the sleep
which he had gained had been fitful and
at odd intervals he had drawn heavily
on his splendid physique and as he
waited for ballards coming he realized
that he could not endure another phys-
ical struggle nor did he intend to

  if i cant down him by sheer will
power im gone he thought wearily
if i add a bit of target practice i may
pull through-but it may not come to
that

  no false hopes were his he knew
the temper of those settlers and knew
that they would be savagely determined
to get hold of cowley he was there to
prevent their doing so-that was all

  another shout sounded closer this
time and another denis realized that
they were trailing cowley having
found the creek entrance and evidently
being without knowledge of what lay
ahead he sat quietly gazing through
the open doorway at the sunny clearing
and waited

  there was a note in those shouts
which he did not like a menacing
bloodhound note which spelled danger
this was a man hunt firing the hnnters
blood with ferocity demanding a vic-
tim knowing neither reason nor mercy
and at the end of the trail sat denis
his blue eyes cold as ice

  then he sighted the hunters

  they appeared in a group running
and halted abruptly at the edge of the
clearing as they scanned the cabin one
of the men that same ed who had
on the previous evening pierced through
denis similarity to his brother had left
his arm in a sling but held a revolver
in his right hand

   hat silent cabin evidently puzzled

them and they were not sure whether
they had run cowley to earth or
whether he had taken horse and fled
they discussed matters then at a ges-
ture from ballard the other three scat-
tered and took to cover along the edge
of the clearing ballard himself rifle
under his arm stepped out and walked
toward the shack his eyes flitting over
it searchingly

  if cowley was here with his rifle
ballard would be a dead man-and
knows it thought denis admiringly
theres one brave man at all events
ballard evinced no hesitation though
he must have known that he wras taking
his life in his hand by that open ad-
vance he strode across the clearing
and paused at the doorway too dazzled
by the sunlight to make out objects
within

  come in ballard spoke up denis
quietly come in this is stewart
speaking but leave your men where
they are

  ballard stared in blank astonishment
as his eyes finally made out the figure
of denis sitting on the bunk opposite
the door with one swift glance
around the otherwise empty room he
stepped inside and eyed denis

  well for the love of mike he
ejaculated slowly thought you had
vamosed down the river last night
no smiled denis i borrowed
one of your canoes and left it on the
shore half a mile below here youll
find it waiting

 hang the canoe snapped the
other wheres cowley we want
that cuss

  thats really too bad returned
denis pleasantly keeping his finger on
the trigger of the rifle across his lap
you wont find him

  eh ballards face set savagely
has he cleared out o here

  not exactly by the way theres
some coffee on the stove help your-
self
trooper stewart substitute



  ballard was puzzled by this cool re-
ception with a bare nod he crossed
to the stove and poured out some of
the bitter black coffee swallowing it
at a gulp then he set down the cup
his eyes fastened on the barred door
whats behind that door stewart
denis shifted his rifle a trifle
hold your rifle just as it is bal-
lard  he said his voice biting like a
whip cowley is behind that door
the settler stiffened his eyes went
to denis in keen surmise noted the
rifle trained on him and rested on the
eyes of denis the two looked at each
other steadily neither wavering but
ballard did not lift his rifle

  look a here stewart wed better
have a little talk i want to know
where you stand and i want to know
mighty quick

  im not standing at present and
denis smiled im sitting  cowleys
bunk meanwhile you have the floor
and im ready to listen shoot ahead
ill do it nodded ballard his face
hard and inflexible you know what
we come here for and why mebbe
you dont know what happened at the
foot o the lake this mornin do ye
i do assented denis quietly i
believe you shot at cowley

  uh-huh and the skunk put a bul-
let into eds shoulder curse him
now we aim to life him in a rope neck-
lace where he belongs and we dont
aim to be interfered with none what-
ever i hope you get me

  denis smiled again-that same de-
ceptive smile

  i understand you perfectly well
ballard you intend to commit mur-
der by hanging cowley cowley may
deserve it of course but id hate to
see you four men getting into court
on a murder charge

  ballard stared at him

  out with it stewart-whats your
position you aint figgering on
playin any low-down tricks arc you

  quite the contrary ballard i came
here this morning and arrested smok-
ing duck a half-breed i then ar-
rested cowley when he returned from
meeting you the two are in the next
room together cowley has been mak-
ing white whisky up here or what
passes for whisky with the indians and
has been trading it for peltries
making whisky ejaculated bal-
lard you sure

  youd better take a look at whats
left of the still and whisky around in
back as i told you last night im
representing my brother big ben
also im representing the law thats
exactly where i stand ballard

the other looked steadily at him
theres four of us all told and one
o you he rejoined slowly dyou
mean to say youre goin to stop us
takin cowley

  exactly nodded denis

  mebbe you figger on releasin cow-
ley and the breed to take a hand 
they are my prisoners ballard
they remain my prisoners-in that
room i have promised them protec-
tion from your lynching party and in-
tend to keep my promise

  then all i can say is youre a
durned fool exploded ballard angrily
were goin to get cowley hear me
if you start any foolin like you talk
about well pile into you and make

you wish you was somewhere else-

  dont forget im representing the
law here interposed denis

  the settler spat scornfully

  law-thunder you aint repre-
sentin nothin no moren i am just
cause your brother is trooper stew-
art dont give you no license to parade
around in them clothes does it not
much you aint no soldier at all
youre just an ordinary man like me
and a blamed fool to boot are you
goin to get out the way or not
denis smiled again

  im very sorry but i must refuse


wide-awake magazine

your invitation to move mr ballard
please observe that this rifle of mine
is cocked and is trained on your left
knee now step outside and tell your
friends what youve heard

  without a word more the settler
turned and departed scornfully strid-
ing a dozen feet from the shack door
he waved an arm

  come on in boys 

  the other three appeared and bal-
lard went to meet them denis watched
their meeting and saw that ballard was
evidently describing what he had found
in the cabin the other three men
broke into strident laughter-and that
was a bad sign

  denis rose and walked to the door
pausing just outside all four turned
to gaze at him and he held up a hand

  just a moment my friends he
called pleasantly do you see that
stump twenty feet to your right
the stump which he indicated was
small and from one side a jagged splin-
ter of wood stood up for six inches
it was white spruce plain to see only
a hundred feet from the shack

  just watch that stump for a mo-
ment went on denis

  lifting his rifle to his shoulder he
sighted at the splinter and pressed the
trigger-seemingly without an instants
hesitation at the crack the splinter
seemed to blow away into nothing

  thank you for your kind attention
smiled denis thats all

  a moments silence greeted this dis-
play of shooting ability denis turned
and went back to the bunk seating him-
self as before facing the door

  the four men conferred together
then with another laugh they marched
forward to the shack ballard in the
lead denis waited until they came
close to the doorway then he lifted
his rifle

  one moment please gentlemen 
they halted ed the wounded man
called in rough but earnest tones

  none o the old stuff stewart we
know darned well you aint a-goin to
shoot us so dont try no bluff we
dont want to hurt you

  an we know you aint no soldier
so cut it out added another

  all that is perfectly true denis
smiled take a look at my rifle-
you see where it is pointing

  they squinted in at him ballard
leaning over denis was pointing his
rifle at the doorsill

  what you say is quite correct he
went on steadily i wouldnt shoot
you down at all but i am equally
correct in saying that you wmit get
cowley unless you shoot me down-
which i dont think youll do by a good
deal i have several cartridges in this
rifle perfectly good ones and youve
seen that i know how to shoot

  of course you can rush me very
likely you will but let me impress
on you just one thing i can fire at
least two shots before you reach me
and then i have a revolver for quick
work the first man of you who sets
his foot on that door threshold will
get a bullet in it-in his foot itll
make a nasty wound too step right
along ballard youll have to murder
me to get cowley you know step
up gentlemen

  no one accepted the invitation

  the seated figure of denis the rifle
leveled and waiting gave them pause
by his steady voice and cold blue eye
they knew that he was in deathly ear-
nest the first to step on the threshold
would probably be crippled for life

  hurry up snapped denis sud-
denly ballard youre the prime
mover of this lynching expedition so
step along with you i f you dont
choose to chance it put a bullet into
me you set out to do murder so
heres your opportunity step out
ballard

  dont ye do it cried one of the
trooper stewart substitute



men hastily pie means it-look at
his face dont ye do it

  most certainly denis meant it and
his resolution was reflected in his pat-
tered face under the blaze of his cold
eyes the four men paused irresolute

  then with an oath ballard shoved
forward throwing up his rifle

  you shoot me an you get a bullet
he cried

  step up said denis coldly

  the settler heaved forward but his
face was whiter than that of denis
and sweat was on his brow with a
quick motion he raised his right foot
over the threshold brought it down
and then poised it an inch from the
floor

  touch the floor said denis im
ready

  ballard heaved his shoulders for-
ward straining as if some invisible
wall were holding him back then-he
turned and stepped away

 go to thunder he snapped
come on home boys i guess stew-
art is competent to get that skunk into
jail without us helpin

  denis lay back weakly in the bunk
and watched them go

       chapter xv
       the back trail

sorry cowley but youll have to
wear those clear into headquar-
ters i wouldnt trust you an inch
without em either

  denis smiled genially at the swin-
dler who grunted sheepishly

 with smoking duck they were
seated about the ruins of cowleys
table enjoying the repast of venison
and coffee which denis had prepared

  balard and his friends had departed
to the foot of the lake convinced of
their going denis had taken a plunge
in the creek and freshened himself
then had set about getting a meal

  he ate amid due precautions how-

ever cowley wore his irons smok-
ing duck with his hands free to eat
sat in the corner across the room from
denis rifle

  i heard what you said to them fel-
lers said cowley gruffly mister i
take off my hat to ye as i said ill
have to take my medcine an ill hold
it agin ye for a while too-but youre
some man believe me any one who
can lick jim cowley an then pull off

the stunt ye pulled off on them-

  forget it smiled denis

ye would ha shot wouldnt ye
maybe i would nodded denis
keeping a wary eye on smoking duck

  before he could say more he was
startled by a shadow at the doorway
catching at his rifle he whirled-to
see the grinning face of the half-breed
napoleon mcshayne

  behind mcshayne were two other
figures one was the slave indian
whom denis had encountered on the
upper hay river old john tadeteecha
the other was a slave unknown to
denis these last two paused outside
while napoleon entered

  before the whatcheer of greet-
ing had been exchanged denis had
swiftly leaped at a scheme which would
relieve him of much labor and trouble
no more speech passed for a moment
napoleon filling a pipe with whittled
tobacco then seeing that smoking
duck had finished his meal denis or-
dered him to stand up

  tie that fellows hands behind his
back poleon  he directed tie em
tight and do the job well

  when the scowling petwanisip was
safely secured denis ordered him
and cowley outside following them
promptly

  now poleon he went on you
go around to that left-hand lean-to
and youll find a very good bunch of
fur haul it all out here you go
and help him john i expect you
traded some of those furs yourself


wide-awake magazine

didnt you well youll get  more
whisky here hop along all of you
the two slave indians grinned as
if at some excellent joke and followed
napoleon the three broke into the
fur cache and presently began to haul
forth bale after bale of fur most of
the pelts were common two or three
bales being separately wrapped and
proving to contain some dark marten
and cross fox pelts of better promise

  two of these better bales denis
handed over to napoleon as the pay
which he had promised for assistance
rendered the second slave gave his
name as tommy and it proved that
he had come to get some whisky in re-
turn for a few sorry muskrat pelts
dennis addressed him straightly

  tommy you clear out of here in a
hurry these pelts are going to stay
here till your people come for them
spread the word that whoever has
traded to cowley for whisky can come
and get his furs back that ought to be
simple enough because each fur is
marked by the man who caught it
dont try any stealing or youll go to
jail run along now

  tommy departed toward the creek
wondering

  you aint goin to hand back all
them peltries groaned cowley seeing
the fruits of his long illegal labors
thus scattered you got to take em

along by law-

  im the law in this case snapped
denis you shut up john you and
napoleon come here

  the two stood before him grinning
vacuously

  i have to take these two prisoners
up the flay to my fathers homestead-
you know the place john did you
take that message to my father

  old john nodded his head and re-
ported that all was well at the home-
stead- denis continued

  napoleon i want you to paddle
them up in your dugout john and i
will come with you in my canoe jll
have to go all the way without sleep
and i wont be able to put in any work
at the paddle after we get there my
brother will want to take these men
 to the peace river and will prob-
ably hire you to help him you take
us up as i have said and ill promise
you good pay in goods and tobacco
how about it

  neither of the aborigines was anx-
ious to work but on the other hand
denis represented the law to them and
it is not wise to refuse aid to the law

  five minutes later with the two
prisoners safely barred in the smaller
room denis rolled up and lay down
across the door they were to start
up lake at sunset and until that time
he was going to make up sleep in an-
ticipation of his long watch on the river
trail for he would not dare trust either
indian to guard the prisoners

  by jasper he thought sleepily
ive made good for ben after all
but believe me ive changed my mind
about going into the mounted yes
sir im contented to remain a plain
unadorned american-this law-and-
order business is just a bit too strenu-
ous for trooper stewart substitute

a record-breaking beet

a red beet that weighs eight and one-half pounds was grown by mrs peter
glatfelter of spring grove pennsylvania it is twenty-two inches long
and twice as many inches in circumference she says she has not been
able so far to find a pot large enough to boil it in
viliam wallace cook

eeply steeped in gloom
perfectly described the
condition of young
nixon j peters lone-
liness and bitter regret
pervaded his soul as he
sat by himself on the
rear seat of the flying
sleigh and thought of what might have
been he had reason to believe that he
was the best skater and ski jumper en-
tered in the winter sports contests at
devils lake on the preceding after-
noon and yet he had lost both main
events by an apparent failure to look
well to his equipment at the last mo-
ment every one had expected that he
would blunder somewhere and so no
one was greatly disappointed that is
no one except nixon j peters

  almost at the take-off of the jump
one of nixons skis had broken he
had taken a wild header and landed in
a snow bank with heels in the air
a big laugh had been the result also
he had cast a skate at the critical mo-
ment of the skating race and the other
contestants had slid past him porter
markham in the lead this same por-
ter markham too had won the ski
jump now porter markham was on
the front seat of the sleigh driving

blithely and exchanging jest and small
talk with hesther morton who sat be-
side him truly nixon j peters lines
had fallen in hard places

  nixon was nix to those who knew
him best often he suffered the crown-
ing indignity of being referred to as the
saphead he had heard the unlovely
nickname applied to him many times
while digging himself out of the snow
bank it had punctuated the merri-
ment released by his sorry mishap
hesther morton had joined in the riot
of laughter nixon knew this only too
well for she was the first person he
had seen after digging the snow out of
his eyes for hesther to be amused
at his expense-well that was some-
thing that hurt

  then while seeking with dogged res-
olution to retrieve himself on the steel
runners a strap had broken and a skate
had shot off across the glittering ice
peters had slipped and slammed around
on the course like a crazy curling stone
finally cutting the feet out from under
a fat spectator who called him saphead
right to his face ah what a wind-up
for a sorry afternoon peters clenched
his hands in his bearskin gloves and
crouched down  the rear seat in a
fruitless effort to efface himself

  lie was nineteen and porter mark-
ham was twenty they both worked for
uncle silas goddard who had a ranch
in montana and made a business of
sending range horses into north dakota
to be halter broken and sold to the set-
tlers goddard was uncle to all his
men in the sense that gives an avuncu-
lar character to every genial middle-
aged person who looks after the welfare
of younger employees

  in the early summer uncle silas had
sent a hundred horses into north da-
kota business had not been good and
late fall found half the horses still 
hand these horses were being win-
tered at the morton ranch on marsh
hay cut and stacked by peters mark-
ham and reece bailey who had been
sent by uncle silas to take care of the
horse herd w hen spring came there
was a promise of turning oft every head
of the stock at a good profit

  the winter so far had not been par-
ticularly lonely for the montana men
the snows of december had been light
and it had been possible for the horses
to paw out considerable forage in the
hills january however brought in a
good fall of the beautiful and it had
been necessary to corral and shelter the
animals and to go extensively into the
feeding

  reece bailey uncle sis foreman
found time to play cribbage with lance
morton hesthers father and peters
and nixon acquired leisure for skating
and skiing popular sports at their home
ranch in the rockies a river-it would
have been a creek in a country of large
streams-flowed through the morton
holdings and its glassy surface offered
a resistless invitation to the steel run-
ners as for the skiing there were
plain and hill for running climbing and
glissading while bailey and morton
were busy at their eternal fifteen-two
fifteen-four peters and markham
were skating or skiing often with hes-
ther who was fond of both sports the

girl if appearances were to be believed
was rather fond of markham also but
had few smiles to waste on peters

  in his bashful blundering way pe-
ters tried to make himself agreeable to
hesther he was big and awkward
however and had tow-colored hair a
slow wit and few graces of speech or
manner his efforts to impress hesther
were overwhelmed by the never-failing
persiflage and the rakish dress and car-
riage of handsome porter markham
markham possessed a confidence in
himself that was sublime a confidence
that shone brilliantly in contrast with
the clumsy ineffectiveness of nixon j
peters

  peters realized this and nourished a
bitter grudge against his physical and
mental shortcomings he used to dream
of a fire at the ranch in which he posed
as a hero and bore the fair hesther to
safety from the ranch house through
a furnace of flames then in his vi-
sions he pictured the girl as taking
his hand and humbly asking his forgive-
ness for her failure to perceive his ster-
ling qualities from the first during
such moments of illusion the saphead
was almost happy but the ranch house
never took fire and the chance to prove
himself a hero by rescuing hesther
morton was denied by fate

  in mid-january however an oppor-
tunity presented itself through the win-
ter sports at devils lake markham
and peters entered themselves in the
ski-jumping contest and skating race
they drove the fifty miles which sep-
arated mortons from the lake and
hesther went with them to see the
carnival of sports and to spend a
night or two with relatives in devils
lake city again peters had dreams
but now on the homeward drive every
hope was shattered and he longed for
a period of blank obscurity and com-
plete retirement

  he could have declared that one of
his skis had been tampered with and
skates skis and a saphead



that one of his skate straps had been
all but cut through with the point of a
knife examination made him sure of
both facts yet it had not occurred to
him to sob he had blundered in not
making certain of his skis and skates
beforehand so he coidd not see how
any one but himself was at fault as
he crouched in the back seat of the
sleigh he considered requesting uncle
silas goddard to recall him to the mon-
tana headquarters there at least he
would be rid of markham and cut off
forever from the demoralizing and dis-
dainful eyes of hesther

  yes he would go back to the home
ranch and he would do this in spite
of something which he knew and which
was very important to his future it
was common knowledge that a place of
preferment was to be given by uncle
silas either to peters or to markham-
a foremanship at a newer ranch with
a chance to acquire an interest in the
horses and cattle reece bailey was
watching peters and markham and on
his report uncle silas would act to
retire from the north dakota venture
of the ranchowner now would cut pe-
ters off entirely from promotion and
drop the plum in porter markhams
hand but peters in the bitterness of
his heart was allowing nothing aside
from his own peace of mind to influence
him yes he would ask uncle silas to
recall him to montana

  you still there nix markham
suddenly asked turning to look rear-
ward

  peters grunted

  youre so blamed quiet went on
markham with a laugh that i reck-
oned you might have taken another
header into the snow back a ways on
the trail

  hesther joined in the laugh and in
spirit poor peters writhed

  the short day was closing and the
sun went down beyond the white ho-
rizon in cold glory they were five-

miles from mortons and markham
had driven the horses so hard that they
were nearly fagged they breathed
wheezingly and frost coated their heav-
ing sides the pace dragged in spite
of markhams relentless use of the
whip

  anyhow spoke up peters suddenly
you might think of the team a little
porter theyre near tuckered

  whos doing this driving cried
markham i never yet had to ask a
saphead for advice in handling horses
and again the whip fell on the strain-
ing flanks

  peters clenched his fists in the bear-
skin gloves it occurred to him that he
could lift markham bodily out of the
front seat take his place and do the
driving himself but he did not

  the horses struggled on and in the
falling dark the travelers topped a
rise that gave them a dim view of the
buildings of mortons ranch a light
showed in one of the ranch-house win-
dows like a star and toward it mark-
ham drove and presently halted at the
door

  now that ive handled the reins all
the way from devils lake nix re-
marked markham as he jumped out
and helped hesther to alight i allow
its up to you to take care of the team
cold essie

  not a bit the girl answered and
hurried toward the door markham
followed her and peter drove on to the
stable

  as he unhitched and brought the
horses into the shelter he was a little
surprised to discover that there were
no other animals in the place the team
was mortons but baileys cow horse
together with those of peters and mark-
ham should have been in the stable
unless bailey was out at the corral and
shelter sheds looking after the fifty
range horses that were kept there

  peters lighted a lantern removed the
harness from the horses and after put-


wide-awake magazine

ting hay in the mangers began rubbing
the animals down with an old gunny
sack he was hard at this when a call
reached his ears from the house pe-
ters this way- the jump

  it was markhams voice and there
was a note of alarm in it that startled
peters lantern in hand he hurried
out of the stable and made his way
to the house flinging the door wide
he crossed the threshold into the ranch-
house sitting room

  whats wrong porter he asked

  the cannon-ball stove glowed with
heat that and the bright oil lamp
dazzled peters eyes for the moment
and he could not see what was going on
in the room

  bailey has been hurt came the
voice of markham every horse in
the herd has been driven off by thieves
-and they even took baileys mount
with the rest biggest outrage that ever
happened in these parts id like to
know what the blamed country is com-
ing to

  the blur lifted from before peters
eyes he saw bailey his face twisted
with pain lying on a couch mrs mor-
ton bent over him bathing a wounded
shoulder from a basin of hot water
her husband was walking up and down
fuming and sputtering markham stood
beside the couch looking down at the
foreman with a queer expression on his
face hesther all excited was remov-
ing her wraps with shaking hands

  horses stolen gasped peters
dazed by the weird calamity how
could it happen  is bailey badly
hurt

  dont stand there gawping fussed
morton something has got to be
done and its up to you and markham
to do it a gang of scoundrels from
across the line made off with the stock
and its been no more than three hours
since it happened take my team and
get to roscommon the sheriffs got
to be notified bailey says the thieves

are making for the north and if you
and markham are quick a posse can
get between the gang and the boundary
line for heavens sake peters wake
up

  peters shook himself put down the
lantern and came to the side of the
couch

  why dont markham wake up he
asked hasnt he suggested anything
yet

  nothing to suggest markham an-
swered flashing a sharp look at peters
its twenty miles to roscommon and
no chance of getting there ahead of the
thieves and the stolen stock the only
animals we can put our hands on are
the two that brought us from devils
lake and they are done up you know
that peters

  what about using skates or skis
inquired peters by thunder there is
a way of getting to roscommon in time
to help the sheriff head off the stolen
stock

ii

  there was a dominant compelling
note in the voice of peters it was so
unexpected in its assertiveness that
every one in the room was startled his
washed-out blue eyes fenced aggres-
sively with the snapping black eyes of
markham

  skates or skis repeated markham
his upper lip curling why its all of
thirty miles to roscommon if you fol-
low the crooks o the river and how
much would you figure it by skis if
you crossed bear butte instead of go-
ing around it talk sense if you know
how nix dont forget the fellows
who rustled our stock have three hours
the lead

  how far will three hours of driving
in this snow get the stolen herd re-
turned peters the thieves will have
a tough job of it they-

  bailey twisted his flushed face from
under the ministering hands of mrs
skates skis and a saphead



morton the varmints are goiiv north
by the long knife dry wash be said
his voice shaking with the pain of bis
wound thats only three miles west
of roscommon if you boys could get
word to the sheriff somehow i reckon
he might head off the raiders with a
posse but if you do anything youll
have to do it quick porter and his
eyes swerved to markham im lookin
to you-uncle si goddard is lookin to
you nigh on to five thousand dollars
wutli of horses are being pushed tords
the border and here im helpless to do
a thing

  it dont seem possible to do a thing
reece returned markham if we
could round up a crowd of men in short
order and take after the thieves on
fresh horses like enough we might
overhaul em but wheres the riding
stock why mortons nearest neigh-
bor is ten miles away

  peters flashed a disapproving glance
at markham pulled off his bearskin
gloves and slumped down in a chair by
the stove from the pockets of his
overcoat he took his skates also a new
strap he had secured in devils lake
city quickly lie replaced the broken
strap with the new one

  you going to try and get to ros-
common by river nix morton in-
quired

  i figure the chances are better that
way than going over bear butte on
skis peters answered the rivers
clean of snow and mostly the ice is like
a lookin-glass im going to do my
best to get word to the sheriff and to
start a roscommon doctor this way to
look after bailey

  youre locoed growled markham
it s all right to get a doctor for reese
here but there aint a chance to save
the stock this side of the line let the
raiders get it across the boundary and
then take the matter up with the ca-
nadian mounted police thats my ad-
vice

  if you wait till the stock is out of
this country put in the rancher there
wont be a chance

  not a chance on earth agreed bai-
ley that outfit o thieves knowed
exactly what they was about every-
thing was cut and dried and somebody
sure tipped em off regardin the lay-
out here ill bet a thousand aginst
a chink wash ticket that them bronks
will be took care of across the line sost
they cant be located by nobody them
thieves picked a time when i was alone
at the shelter sheds and porter and
nix was to the winter sports at the
lake they dropped me out o my sad-
dle without any whys or wherefores
and then made off with my mount and
sent a man to the stable for peters and
markhams ridin horses by the time
 covered the mile back to the ranch
house the stock was well on the way
north i--

  he broke off abruptly clenching his
teeth hard as a spasm of pain ran
through his body

  ill get another coat remarked pe-
ters rising from his chair and starting
for the door that led to his room it
wont be possible to make any kind of
time in a long overcoat like this he
disappeared

  markham came to the side of the
couch if peters has a chance reece
said he liell make a bobble of some
kind and spoil it all thats his way
i better go to roscommon myself pe-
ters can use his skates and take the
river trail and ill use my skis and go
over the butte i dont think we have
a ghost of a show to head off the stock
but its up to us to see what we can
do

  thats the talk exclaimed morton
approvingly the thieves had help
from this ranch he added darkly toss-
ing a significant glance toward the door
through which peters had just passed
and i havent got a whole lot of con-


wide-awake magazine

fidence in at least one man around
here

    peters is square bailey averred
 square as a die he jest dont seem
 to have the knack for puttin his idees
 across the man that saves them
 bronks porter he added significantly
 is goin to make the biggest kind of a
 hit with goddard

    if any one connects with the sheriff
 at roscommon in time to save the
 bronks markham returned it will be
 me he spoke with a confidence that
 thrilled every one in the room and hes-
 ther if the red in her cheeks and the
 sparkle in her eyes were any indica-
 tion most of all ill be ready he
 finished moving toward the door in
 about two shakes

   you must have some hot coffee be-
 fore you start said hesther and
 ill see that it is ready for you

   markham was back in the room be-
 fore peters had reappeared he wore
 a leather coat and the bottoms of his
 trousers were laced inside his high shoe
 tops trim and handsome he looked
 and ready for a grueling nights work
 hesther was just placing the coffee on
 the table and she lifted her eyes to
 flash a glance of admiration at the
 young ski runner

    ill be ready in a minute essie
 said markham with a nod and a smile

   taking his skis from a corner of
 the room he sat down laid them across
 his knees and proceeded to grease them
 well from a can which he had brought
 into the room and had placed  the
 stove while he worked peters came
  lumbering in

    peters had donned a ragged sweater
 whose collar came up around his ears
 over this was buttoned a faded and
 threadbare coat his old-fashioned
 skates were under his arm from be-
 neath the rim of his moth-eaten fur cap
 his tow hair showed in a sort of fringe
 the cap had ear flaps with strings at
 their ends the flaps were loose and

the strings fluttered as he moved his
head his shoes were of cowhide
strong and serviceable but not at all
ornamental he had tied the bottoms
of his trousers to his ankles with pieces
of cord

  the contrast between peters and
markham was very striking so far as
appearances went markham had it
on peters by about a hundred to
one

  im going too nix observed
markham laying his skis to one side
ill go over the butte and ive got a
months pay that says i beat you into
roscommon

  maybe you will returned peters
starting for the outside door

  there was more bitterness in peters
heart he believed he understood the
situation markham had won the ski
jump and the skating race and now he
wanted to round off his triumphs by
being first to carry the news of the
horse thieving to the sheriff markham
was planning a spectacular bit of work
for uncle si goddard incidentally
mainly he was thinking of the effect
of his nights success on hesther mor-
ton

  wait nixon called mrs morton
essie has got some hot coffee ready
and you must have a cup before you
leave

  the ranchers wife was the only one
who ever gave much thought to peters
she considered him now when the con-
sideration and confidence of the others
seemed to center wholly in markham

  much obliged mrs morton pe-
ters answered but i dont reckon ill
take the time you see he added as
he laid a hand on the doorknob its a
case where every minute counts

  before the good woman could an-
swer the door had closed behind pe-
ters markham pulled up his shoulders
in a shrug as he lifted the cup of steam-
ing coffee

  theres nixons first blunder he
skates skis and a saphead



remarked he lias a habit of going it
blind and without giving any prepara-
tion to the work ahead of him

  i hope he wont meet with any acci-
dent murmured mrs morton that
boys got a good heart even if he is a
little odd

  hell always be a blunderer and a
saphead grnnted her husband if
the stolen horses are recovered itll be
markham who makes it possible

  markham did not tarry long over his
toftee within a few moments after
peters left he was out in the nipping air
hesther a shawl over her head stepped
through the doorway to watch while he
crossed the trampled snow around the
ranch house and then knelt to thrust
the toes of his shoes in the bilgeri bind-
ing of the skis and to buckle the ankle
straps he arose presently and shout-
ing a farewell to the girl glided away
over the snowy level gracefully swiftly
with his ski stick biting into the snow
and propelling him onward

  hes doing a mans work this night
murmured hesther and he will win-
just as he won at devils lake city
carnival then she went back into the
house to describe in detail how peters
had lost and markham had won in the
winter sports contests at the lake

iii

  puyallup river had many twists and
turns in the thirty miles which it cov-
ered between mortons ranch and ros-
common passing within a stones
throw of the ranch house it flowed al-
most due north for six miles then en-
tering the rough hill country it doubled
back on its course for three miles
rounded the base of rawsons bluff in
a four-mile curve came east by south
around the base of bear butte and then
curved in a northwesterly direction for
the last twelve miles that carried it
through the outskirts of the county seat
markham on his skis could con a

direct course to roscommon bisecting
the river at three points and finally
climbing the butte for a long glissade
into the town that glissade right into
the edge of the settlement measured
ten miles of down grade the slopes
of bear butte were smooth and directly
under its crest the descent was steep
a mile of this and then the course fell
away more gently

  markham if he made good time to
the eastern base of bear butte would
very likely reach that particular spot
ahead of peters for he would have to
travel only seven miles while peters
was going sixteen where markham
would lose would be in climbing the
butte and where he would make up his
loss would be in the long glissade down
the opposite side

  at the rivers edge peters screwed
the skates into his heels pulled the
straps tight and buckled them then put
on his bearskin gloves and struck out
he was well away toward rawsons
bluff before markham made his first
crossing of the river near the ranch
house

  the ice was in splendid condition a
strong wind had swept it clean of loose
snow save here and there at the turns
where drifts had formed then a slight
thaw a few days before had been fol-
lowed by a tightening of the cold and
all rough spots had been smoothed
away

  markham whose steel runners were
the very last word in all-metal skates
excelled as a figure skater he could
cut all sorts of graceful figures on the
ice and with hesther morton would
do a sort of waltz which the girl seemed
to consider rare sport peters on the
other hand was not proficient at that
sort of thing he preferred straight
skating possibly because he realized
that fancy capers were quite out of his
line the steel wood and leather with
which he was shod seemed best adapted
to straightaway work anyhow


wide-awake magazine

  peters knew every foot of the river
between the ranch and roscommon he
had covered that long stretch of ice
several times while getting himself in
trim for the skating race at devils
lake there was white ice under the
shelter of the bluff and the butte caused
by a fall of snow while the first crystals
were forming this had been full of
air bubbles and had been treacherous
up to the time the severe frost had fol-
lowed the thaw after that the lique-
fied snow had congealed into a sound
and superlative smoothness there was
not a spot to be feared on the entire
course

  with long steady swinging strokes
peters swept around the first turn and
came south on the stretch which mark-
ham was to cross in order to thread a
seam through ravvsons bluff but al-
though the moonlight was brilliant upon
the sparkling snow crust he could see
nothing of his rival it might be he
reasoned that markham had already
effected his second crossing of the river
and was even then in the gash that cut
through the bluff peters ground his
teeth and with his runners ringing
musically passed like a gliding specter
around the bluffs base three miles
farther and he might obtain a view
of markham as he emerged from the
shallow defile and pushed over the open
levels toward the butte

  he was having queer thoughts about
markham why had the fellow pro-
tested against any attempt to reach ros-
common and notify the sheriff then
in the face of his protests why had he
determined to pit his skis against pe-
ters skates-to accomplish the thing
which he had averred could not be ac-
complished 

  there was but one answer to this ac-
cording to peters conclusions mark-
ham could not bear to think that peters
might succeed that he might win favor-
able notice from uncle silas and that
he might gain some credit in the eyes

of hesther morton  markham was not
thinking of saving the horses no he
was impressed with the idea of his own
prestige and importance and he could
not take a chance of losing out to a
saphead that was all there was to it
so peters believed

  a determination to win that race and
save the stolen stock grew stronger and
stronger in peters breast here after
the miserable failures at devils lake
was a most unexpected opportunity to
retrieve himself it was his business to
make the most of it

  three straight miles lay ahead of
him to the westward of the bluff com-
ing down the stretch like the wind he
surveyed the shadowy opening of the
swale in the hope of catching a glimpse
of markham but the ski runner was
not in sight in the distance the spar-
kling crest of bear butte could be
vaguely determined yet between the
bluff and the butte no dusky figure
could be seen toiling on the skis

  he hasnt cleared the bluff yet
thought peters exultantly im leading
him by ginger

  the river at the end of the three-mile
stretch described a curve like a gigan-
tic horseshoe in its first beginning
the stream had attempted to run west
by south meeting the rough country
its course had been deflected toward the
northwest then striking the wide-
spreading base of bear butte it had
followed northeast and east on its way
around the huge uplift on clearing
the butte the puyallup struck off due
northwest and so in a dozen miles
came to roscommon

  peters although he had not timed
himself knew he had been making ex-
cellent speed he was seventeen miles
from the ranch and coming rapidly un-
der the shadow of the butte markham
could scarcely climb the massive rise
and glissade into roscommon ahead of
him so far as he had been able to
skates skis and a saphead



discover markham was not yet any-
where near bear butte nor-

  peters i say peters

  peters was amazed above his ring-
ing steel a sharp cry echoed in the frosty
air it was markhams voice and call-
ing his name peters dug into the ice
with the heels of his runners and came
to a quick halt

  that you porter he called

  yes nix im in hard luck stop
a minute will you 

  the voice came from a shadowy over-
hang at the buttes foot peters skated
toward the black cavity and was met
by the dusky figure of markham limp-
ing out of the darkness and across the
ice markham had his skis under his
arm

  by george cried peters you
got here in a hurry whats wrong
i fell from a six-foot bank as i
was crossing the river and splintered
one of my skis was the answer and
i cant go on with the wood runners
 reckon ill take your skates mark-
ham added coolly

  peters caught his breath i reckon
you wont he returned with spirit
im going on to roscommon start the
sheriff and a posse for the dry wash
and get a doctor for bailey what do
you take me for

  a saphead-just a plain everyday
saphead said markham down on
the ice peters and off with those
skates  pronto is the word  theres
no time to lose

  markham had dropped the skis and
stripped a glove from his right hand
the bare hand was in the pocket of his
leather coat suddenly as the two stood
facing each other the hand emerged
from the pocket with a short uglv-
looking bulldog revolver markham
leveled the weapon and the moonlight
glinted frostily on the barrel

  again peters caught his breath he
was dazed bewildered to be threat-
ened in that manner by one whom he

had believed to be a friend-or if not
a friend at least a fellow employee of
uncle silas goddard with interests in
common-was a decided shock

  you crazy porter demanded pe-
ters when he could find his tongue

  hardly was the reply with a
husky ill-omened laugh it will be a
long time before you reach rosmom-
mon my laddybuck take off those
skates i tell you i mean business pe-
ters 

  there was that in markhams words
and manner which left no doubt of the
fact that he meant business peters was
wild with indignation and anger but
he was also helpless

  whatll reece bailey say to this
when i tell him he asked dropping
to the ice and working at the skate
straps

  well cross that bridge when we get
to it was the response throw the
skates over here when you get em off
you had to butt into this deal with the
fool suggestion of getting word to the
sheriff now blame you take your medi-
cine 

  youre bound to win grunted pe-
ters if you have to do it with a gun
you aint square markham  may be
a good deal of a saphead but i found
when it was too late that one of my
skis and one of my skate straps had
been tampered with at devils lake
you did that

  why didnt you tell hesther about
it jeered markham or the judges
of the contests didnt you have nerve
enough to put up a holler peters
gave the skates a shove across the ice

  ten feet away markham sat down
to screw the skates to his heels and ad-
just the straps the revolver lay at
his side and he watched peters sharply
as he worked

  peters a desperate purpose forming
in his mind was awaiting the moment
when he could spring to the attack he
was not to be conquered in that way


wide-awake magazine

there was plenty of fight in him and
markham would discover it to his cost

 markham worked rapidly the
skates were on and snugly buckled and
he was just rising when peters went
after him with a short run and a slide
but if peters was quick markham was
a shade quicker

  crack

  the revolver exploded in theair and
peters left arm seemed suddenly to
have been scorched with a hot iron the
shock caused him to lose his footing
and he fell in a sprawl on the slippery
surface of the river

  you would have it shouted mark-
ham fiercely thats something more
for you to tell bailey

  the last words faded in mellow ring
of sliding steel peters sitting up on
the ice and clasping his numbed arm
with his right hand watched markham
slip from sight around the curve at the
foot of bear butte

iv

  peters was thinking less of the pain
in his arm than he was of the rascally
work of peter markham the fellow
must be mad to make such an attack
he had planned the whole thing of
course and had armed himself before
leaving mortons reaching the butte
ahead of peters he had gone into hid-
ing against the moment peters should
come skating down the river then by
way of making his treachery more con-
temptible he had called to peters for
help only to threaten him with a re-
volver and steal his skates

  you bet ill tell bailey muttered
peters i reckon thisll cook your
goose with goddard even if you do get
to roscommon in time to have the sher-
iff head off the bronks what can a
fellow make of a man like him acting
thataway 

with difficulty peters removed his
coat and shoved up the shirt and

sweater sleeves the wound was in the
forearm and was bleeding profusely
with a bandanna handkerchief he
bound up the injury tightly knotting the
handkerchief corners with his fingers
and his teeth then getting into his
coat again he began considering his
next move

  it was twelve miles by river to ros-
common and eighteen miles back to the
ranch even if it was now useless for
him to get to the town in order to
carry the news of the horse stealing to
the sheriff returning to mortons would
have been a fierce pull on his strength
and he dared not attempt it he would
make his way to roscommon if lie
could reach the settlement before mark-
ham left it he would lodge a complaint
against the treacherous scoundrel and
have him held in the town jail peters
was burning for revenge yes that is
what he would do

  he got up feeling a little dizzy and
faint and started down the river his
feet struck against markhams skis and
another idea came to him perhaps he
could tinker up the splintered ski and
use the runners after the accident
that had lost him the jump at devils
lake peters had bought a little fine
wire for the mending of his own broken
runner that wire was still in his
trousers pocket and it might be that
he could use it in fixing markhams
splintered ski

  picking up both runners and holding
the damaged one between his knees he
struck a match and made a careful ex-
amination the stout ash had been
cracked under the binding mechanism
a few wraps of fine wire might yet
make the runner serve with his jack-
knife peters dug a shallow groove
across the skis bottom and in this he
imbedded the half dozen coils of wire
that lie wove over and over and made
fast on the upper surface

  for himself he had never fancied
that bilgeri binding although light
skates skis and a saphead



and well made it was not nearly so
strong or dependable as the lilienfield
binding with which peters own skis
were equipped

  peters work had been done at a tre-
mendous disadvantage he could work
with one hand only and in lieu of his
other hand he made shift to use his teeth
the moon although brilliant left much
to be desired in the matter of light for
such fine and exacting labor and sense
of touch had to help him where that
of sight failed in the main however
he did very well all things considered
and when he had secured his feet in
the bindings he arose on the ash run-
ners with a feeling of exultation in his
breast where was the stick his
search for it carried him to the over-
hang and there he found not only the
ski stick but two strips of gunny sack-
ing each heavily knotted in the middle

  those strips of sacking rather puz-
zled peters markham had brought
them as an aid in getting up the steep
eastern slope of the butte but why
had he prepared himself with them if
his object was to waylay peters and
secure the skates

  markham always figures a matter
out both ways peters reflected he
brought the gun to help corral the
skates but if i happened to beat him
to the butte then hed have to keep right
 over the rise if he couldnt do one
thing then he was ready to do the other
whats more he splintered that ski
a-purpose and he didnt do it until he
knew i was behind him at the over-
hang he didnt want me to have a
chance to use the ski thats all it
never occurred to him that id have
something along to use in patchin up
the runner thats once anyhow that
a saphead fooled him

  peters shuffled his way to a point be-
yond the overhang then paused to tie
the strips of cloth around the skis knot
side down this maneuver would help
to keep him from sliding backward

  he flashed an upward look at the
difficult grade he was to negotiate if
his heart failed him for a moment be-
cause of his useless arm and the shock
his whole body had suffered because of
the wound it only resulted in letting
him get a firmer grip on his resolution
and strength the wound was nothing
serious being merely a clean gash
through the fleshy part of the forearm
he would not allow it to endanger the
success of his nights exploit mark-
ham must be made to suffer for his law-
lessness and it was up to peters to sec
that he did not escape

  the first easy slopes of the butte
were taken just as one might travel
over level ground-a forward move-
ment in long gliding steps the skis
were merely advanced never lifted as
the ascent stiffened peters turned out
the ends of the runners slightly in what
is known as the half fishbone step
there was a trick in this and peters
had long since acquired it steeper and
steeper became the course as the snowy
slope was climbed and the full fishbone
step was gradually brought into requisi-
tion

  for such a long ascent the work was
extremely tiring and peters was forced
to do a number of serpentines tack-
ing back and forth and executing the
difficult about face at each turn

  a good deal of time was required in
making the climb but peters handicap
of awkwardness had taught him how
to be patient and doggedly resolute in
carrying out his aims he kept un-
flinchingly to his tiresome task and in
due course was rewarded by finding
himself on the flat crest of bear butte
ready for the long glissade by this
time his sporting blood was aroused
and he looked forward with keen enjoy-
ment to the breathlessly swift glide that
lay ahead of him

  he rested a few moments tucked the
hand of his injured arm into the front
of his coat removed the knotted strips

from the runners took firm hold of
the ski stick and then let himself over
the buttes crest

  with skis so close together that they
touched the point of one leading the
other by a foot body not bent but in-
clined forward peters was off down the
steep slope like a bullet out of a gun

  he was at a disadvantage in not hav-
ing both hands for use with the stick
where it was necessary to brake and
avoid a small crevasse or a bowlder
peters did it entirely with the skis by
executing the telemark swing it
was not often that he was confronted by
such an emergency but he was profi-
cient in that method of dodging possi-
ble disaster and unhesitatingly availed
himself of it

  at lightning speed he shot-down the
butte the air humming in his ears and
snowy particles stinging his face his
exhilaration mounted higher and higher
in his delight over the coasting he for-
got the stolen horses the treachery of
markham and the reprisal he was
counting upon when he should reach
roscommon his every faculty was
called into pla and busied itself with
the flying skis to the exclusion of every-
thing else

  the slope flattened and peters speed
lessened perceptibly although he was
still going at a rate comparable to that
of a limited express train on and on
mile after mile his sensation was that
of one falling through space he
scarcely realized that he had any con-
nection whatever with the white-clad
earth beneath him

  at last in the distance he saw a
twinkling light and a confused blur of
buildings roscommon the town
jumped toward him as though crazily
bent on fouling his course he gave
rather more attention to roscommon
than to the slope ahead of him and
suddenly he pitched into the air as the
runners hit an obstacle he fell with
the skis braided around his neck fell

hard upon the cleared tracks of the
roscommon railroad yards and so sud-
denly that he had no time to realize he
had gone over the embankment at the
side of the network of rails

  instinctively he tried to lift himself
only to drop in an awkward huddle
with a blaze of shooting stars criss-
crossing before his eyes then the
bright lights faded and nixon j peters
quietly went to sleep

v

  when peters awoke he found him-
self on a bench in the railroad station
a local train was expected and there
had been men on the station platform
when peters shot over the railroad em-
bankment and hit the tracks three
or four of the men went forward to
investigate the strange phenomenon
and they were the ones who had brought
peters into the waiting room they
had no more than laid him down and
stripped off his skis when he opened
his eyes

  sheriff gone to the dry wash yet
he inquired faintly

  a man bent over him im jordan
the sheriff said he what dry wash
do you mean  why should i go there 

 has-hasnt markham reached
town  went on peters

  havent seen a thing of markham
oh jordan exclaimed i know you
now you are baileys man peters
from the morton ranch why were
you sliding into town at this time o
night on a pair of skis thunder it
was as much as your life was worth
you-

  a gang of horse thieves ran off our
horses-moren fifty of em cut in pe-
ters wildly it happened early in the
evening get a posse jordan and head
off the gang at long knife dry wash
when markham shows up leave some-
body in town to arrest him he shot
me in the arm and send a doctor to
skates skis and a saphead



mortons to look after bailey hes
wounded too i-

  then peters went to sleep again
when he next came to himself and
picked up the chain of events he was
in a bed in a room at the roscommon
house broad day looked in at the
room windows and peters could gaze
dreamily out at roofs covered with
snow and sparkling under the suns
rays as though covered with diamonds
hours had passed since he had had the
brief awakening in the railroad station
now he was in a comfortable bed his
left arm neatly bandaged and toynbee
the proprietor of the hotel was sitting
beside him

  did they get markham toynbee
asked peters

  the landlord was reading a newspa-
per he jumped in his chair as the
unexpected words reached him from the
bed

  oh youre back eh said he
youve been a long time on the road
although the doctor said we neednt to
mind get markham well i guess
and toynbee chuckled jordan got
him and four others along with the
stolen horses they were pushing
through the dry wash when the sheriff
and his party arrived there you bet
they got him peters and red-handed at
that big surprise to everybody why
markham had put the whole thing up
he was back of the entire scheme it
has all come out markham wont talk
but the rest of the gang feel different
across the line there were men waiting
to take the horses and rush em off
where theyd never be found say i
guess you ought to have a medal for
what you did last night how are you
feeling anyhow

  peters was stunned porter mark-
ham one of the horse thieves could
peters believe his ears markham had
had a reason for driving the horses off
their feet on the return from devils
lake with all the other stock taken

from mortons it hail been markhams
plan to make the sleigh team useless so
far as a drive of twenty miles to ros-
common with news for the sheriff was
concerned  and markham had protested
against peters plan of using skates in
carrying an alarm to roscommon but
when the method had been put into ef-
fect in spite of him markham had
taken to the skis and had waylaid pe-
ters at the eastern foot of bear butte
in the light of recent events the motive
for that attack could be seen at an even
more treacherous angle markhams
scheme was not to beat peters to ros-
common with news for the sheriff but
to keep all knowledge of the robbery
from the authorities until the stolen
horses had been delivered across the
line instead of making for the town
after securing peters skates markham
had followed the river bends beyond the
town to a point where he could join
his rascally confederates with the horse
herd

  how do you feel peters repeated
toynbee after waiting a long time for
a reply

  mighty nigh locoed said peters

  no wonder say you hit the rail-
road iron with your head when you
went over the embankment any other
head but yours would probably have
been cracked

  you cant crack a saphead com-
mented peters but not in bitterness

  next day when peters was thinking
of getting out of his bed and helping
drivethe horses back to the ranch no
less a person than uncle silas goddard
walked into his room uncle silas was
an iron-gray man big and broad and
with a regular heart under his ribs he
had received a telegram signed reece
bailey per morton and had come to
north dakota by first train

  there were greetings not those of a
pleased employer for a worthy em-
ployee but more in line with what ones


wide-awake magazine

next of kin might say in circumstances
altogether creditable bailey was com-
ing fine and would be on the job again
in two or three weeks and peters the
doctor said would be fit as a fiddle in
seven days at the outside the horses
were on the way back to mortons

 what about markham queried
peters

  uncle silas goddards cheery face
grew troubled well markham was
only a boy and a very foolish one he
had had a hard lesson no stock had
been lost and uncle silas felt that he
ought not to be too hard on markham
he was going to let markham go on a
promise to leave the country and make
something of himself in other parts
any one at all acquainted with uncle
silas might have known he would do
that very thing

  as for you nixon the big ranch-

owner went on theres a job waiting
in montana for a chap of your heft and
disposition but do you want to re-
turn to the home ranch  he asked quiz-
zically miss hesther morton sends
a very kindly message to you by me
she is sorry for a lot of things she
says and hopes to see you right soon

  but nixon j peters had seen another
light he recalled his saphead dreams
of rescuing hesther from a burning
house and the shamed red stained his
cheeks to the tow-colored hair

  miss morton all at once is wasting
her consideration on the wrong party
uncle silas said peters pm for
montana as soon as you want me
there

  good exclaimed uncle silas and
clasped peters hand with a fervor that
suggested not only good will but hearty
congratulations

  as the stenographer
closed the door behind her freeman
judd spun his pivoted desk chair in a
half circle and with hands clasped
across his stomach gazed thoughtfully
at the calendar on the wall for a full
minute he sat this way without moving
then whirling back again he pressed
the button at the side of his desk

  a freckle-faced fed-headed office
boy answered

  george said mr judd i guess
hes waited long enough tell him to
come in now

  the office boy grinned appreciatively
a moment later the door opened to ad-
mit a dapper young man who looked
something as freeman judd must have
looked twenty-five years before

  the embarrassment as father and
son faced each other ended when judd
senior said brusquely sit down
vern sit down  chairs dont cost any-
thing in this office whats the matter
now what are yoh here for

  the boy looked him frankly in the
eyes thompson brothers fired me
this morning

  if his father was irritated his face
did not betray the fact as a busi-
ness man he grunted you dont seem
to be much of a success

  the boy swallowed it was like
downing a bitter dose of medicine
you see father he blurted out ive
come to believe you were right and i
was wrong i want to start in the busi-
ness here just the way i did four years
ago

  ah you do freeman judd sur-
veyed his son a little grimly suppose
we review this thing vern youre a
rich mans son when you went to
college i gave you a good big allow-
ance i wanted you to have all the ad-
vantages that i had missed what did
you do there did you stick to any-
thing did you learn one thing-one
single thing-thoroughly 

  not a thing admitted vernon judd
cheerfully unless you count basket
ball

  basket ball  hm  i dont see how
that is going to help you make a suc-
cess of life well you graduated-
though heaven knows how and came
in here three months later you quit
things were too slow for you your
grandfather had left you a little legacy
and you wanted action

  the younger judd chuckled didnt
i get it

  you did admitted his father al-

lowing his face the luxury of a smile
you got the action and the wall street
boys got your money since then youve
tried a dozen things never holding on
to one of them longer than a month or
six weeks and now you breeze back
and ask me to give you another chance

  the boy leaned forward earnestly
his mouth tightening into the same lines
of determination that marked his
fathers

  dad a week ago i took myself into
my room and had a frank talk with
myself when i was through id made
up my mind to quit being a chump and
to turn myself into something useful
i wasnt fired from thompson brothers
because i didnt do my work but be-
cause i wouldnt stand for a piece of
dirty office politics ive found myself
this time ill stick it out do i get
another chance or not 

  freeman judd looked the boy over
much as though he were eying a horse
vern he said finally i never thought
id do such a thing but im inclined to
give you another go at your old job
i know youve got the goods and i

believe at last- a knock at the

door stopped him come in wallber

  sorry to disturb you mr judd
said the head clerk as he entered with
an envelope in his hand but the man
who brought this said it had to have an
answer right away

  as he made out the letterhead the
boys face became a shade paler his
father scanned the communication with
a frown

 vern-the voice had taken a
harsher tone-this is a statement from
flett  son they say you owe them
one hundred and fifteen dollars for
some evening clothes and that if it isnt
paid they will be obliged to sue

  its a rotten trick dad i bought
the stuff eight months ago id have
paid for it too if  hadnt lost my jobs
while i was laying aside the money i
havent been dodging them i ex-

plained how it was anyhow they
hadnt any business sending a bill to

you im over age and-

  his father stood up abruptly its
legalized blackmail he snapped they
think ill pay this rather than allow it
to get into the papers and theyre
right he paced up and down the
room without speaking suddenly he
faced the boy vern ive changed my
mind about you i dont want you in
here until you can prove to me that you
are able to get a job paying enough to
live on and to hold it for a reasonable
time

 but dad-

  his father held up an interrupting
hand no use talking i have de-
cided when you have learned to stand
alone on your own two feet then you
may come in with judd  company-
not before any more bills no all
right ill pay this one then i intend
giving you an order on the cashier for
thirty dollars take that and buy a
railroad ticket that will land you the
greatest distance from new york i
dont care where you go the only con-
dition is that you finally land a job and
that you keep it for a full six months
that shall be the test understand
six months in the same position
vernon judd nodded soberly

 when youve shown you can do
that and have lived on what you earn
without running bills come back and
youll find a desk waiting for you if
you cant do it i dont want to see you
again well

  thats a fair proposition dad six
months at the same job on a living
wage ill do it

  freeman judd sucked in his lower
lip heres your order for the thirty
dollars then and remember vern
nobody wants to see you win more than
your old dad good-by as you go
through the outer office tell wallber i
want to see him

  the round football struck the branch
and descended bouncing merrily upon
the head of the innocent bystander

  we didnt mean to mister apolo-
gized the small boy who had done the
kicking

  dont mind me id rather get a
crack on the head than not in spite
of a stomach that lacked breakfast
vernon judd managed a smile as he
tossed back the association football

  hard knocks aplenty had toughened
vern since the day the train dropped
him into the bustling middle western
city an unknown person in an unfa-
miliar place and what was more he
was without trade or profession for
three days he had been an extra
hotel porter for a week till the dull
season set in he had opened boxes in
a department-store basement and twice
he had earned scraps of money by un-
loading trucks but of continuous em-
ployment he had found none

  he squared his shoulders now at the
cheering discovery that both factories
had entrances within a hundred feet of
where he was standing along the big
shop on his right ran the sign landon
sporting goods-used all over the
world across the street equally large
letters shouted bloss company-per-
fection sporting goods-for sale
everywhere

  both landon and bloss the original
owners were dead but for years the
managers of the rival factories had
waged an advertising war from cairo
illinois to cairo egypt basket balls
baseballs footballs hockey sticks bats
gold clubs boxing gloves and every-
thing else for the athlete had been
boosted and knocked by each side and
here the two competitors glowered at
each other less than a stones throw
apart to vern who all his life had
read their advertising and used their
goods it seemed like coming suddenly

  upon the duke of wellington and na-
poleon bonaparte

  the job hunter meditated lets
see the year we had the big cham-
pionship team we used the bloss basket
ball the year after that we used the
landon it wasnt as good and we
werent as good all right bloss old
boy youll get the first chance

  he entered boldly a pugnacious of-
fice boy on the other side of a wooden
railing stopped him

 whatcha want demanded the
guardian of the gate suspiciously

  hard experience had taught vern
that discretion is sometimes half the
battle

  i want to see the superintendent
he answered evasively

  creighton lissen if you wanta
job ill save you a lot of time right off
the bat by tellin you there aint none
you tell mr creighton that mr
judd-mr vernon judd of new york
-wants to see him insisted the waller
with as much haughtiness as a man
without a thin dime can muster

  reluctantly the office boy slouched
toward the door marked private

  all right he said emerging a min-
ute later go on in

  vern had no more than entered the
room before he saw that his hopes were
doomed to failure he had counted
upon finding the superintendent an ath-
letic type of man to whom his own
experience in athletics might appeal
instead he was greeted by a frowning
cigar-chewing individual who plainly
had never taken an active part in any
game except from the side lines

  well he snapped as he thrust some
papers under the desk blotter what do
you want a job his voice rasped
like a file cant you see that sign
out there go to the other entrance
between seven and eight thursday
morning dont take up my time

  i know i am taking up valuable

quietly but i think ive had valuable

experience that might fit me for-

  havent a thing for you no use
talking the shrill voice rose higher
not a thing nothing at all good
morning 

  the young man found himself on the
street again with a sense of injustice
rankling in his mind as he stood there
trying to soothe his temper before
tackling the landon people his eye
caught the end of a tiny tragedy

  he heard an excited little scream
he saw a white-sleeved arm thrust
frantically from one of the second-
story windows of the landon factory
he watched a square of snowy linen
float out on a passing gust of wind
for a second it seemed that it would
escape the clutches of the waiting tree
and come safely to the ground  but just
at the critical moment the breeze died
dropping the white handkerchief like
an opened parachute across a network
of autumn foliage there it rested
twenty feet or more above the sidewalk
and a dozen from the girl at the
window

  -vern looked up the instinct of mere
politeness that had first urged him to
offer assistance tautened into enthusi-
asm he told himself the girl was more
charming than any girl he had ever
seen

  ill get it he called encouragingly
though without the slightest idea in
the world how he might bring about
that end

  if you will please she begged
its a bit of real irish lace and i
havent any business owning it-let
alone losing it

  as he stared at the girl and the hand-
kerchief the inspiration came

  here buddie he said lend me
your football for a minute

  obediently the small boy tossed it
over it was round but slightly smaller
and not as heavy as the basket ball to
which he had been accustomed also

  the handkerchief was much higher than
any basket for which he had tried in a
game

  he poised it carefully swinging it
up and down in his two hands to gauge
the weight then with a quick flirt of
his arms he shot it up and over

  it curved in a long arc and plumped
squarely into the middle of the white
patch in the tree the twigs bent the
handkerchief fluttered down into his
waiting hands

  as he stood there brushing the dust
from the fragile fabric the girl from
landons hurried out to him i want
to thank you she said gratefully

  he looked at her risking the chance
of being thought impudent he said
boldjy and i want to know you my
name is judd-vernon judd

  she stared straight into his eyes for
a moment and was apparently satisfied
with what she saw there i-i dont
think it will be difficult she said al-
most in a whisper and turned away
confused and blushing

  say young fella vern turned to
the new speaker who proved to be
creighton the disagreeable superin-
tendent of the bloss factory his face
now stretching into a smile say i
saw you make that basket-ball throw
where did you ever play what you
mean you were the center of that champ
team the igir five that were never
licked  listen  he put his hand in-
gratiatingly upon the boys arm we
have a basket-ball team in this factory
thats a world-beater and we need a
new man for center lemme see you
throw again to make sure that other
toss wasnt a lucky accident hey
murph 

  a carrot-topped head popped out of
the window over the entrance get
the big wastebasket murph and hold
it out there  wanta see this guy make
a throw come on you ill give you
three chances because its a hard shot

  for once in his life vern felt nerv-
the basket-ball boss



ous the skill that had made him star
of a star team seemed to have oozed
quite away

  try the girl whispered you can
do it i know you can

  again he poised the ball and threw
then holding his breath he watched
it wing its curved path through the
air-up over down  down fair and
true into the mouth of the waiting
wicker basket

  yea bo shouted the enthusiastic
murphy he can thread the needle all
right

 look here my man superin-
tendent creighton caught verns coat
lapel if i give you a job in the stock
room at ten a week will you get out
and play on our basket-ball team this
winter

 will i asked vern try me
and see

  the girl from landons extended her
hand to him heres wishing you good
luck she said till-

  till when

  till the bloss five meets the landon
five-till your team plays ours

iii

  the big five from the bloss com-
pany lined up for the last minute of
the final practice before the champion-
ship game of the season

  fast now jerked captain red
murphy as he tossed the ball to curly
clark who shot it to clif sefton who
underhanded it to felber who dribbled
it a moment and then bounced it to
vernon judd who completed the cir-
cuit and play by landing it neatly and
accurately in the basket

  attaboy red growled now the
same thing on the other side fellows-
and lots of pep

  three times in succession from three
different and difficult angles vern had
the pleasure of seeing his throws drop
safely inside the iron-rimmed net

  good enough admitted red
well show those landon counterfeits
how to play to-morrow night now just
a minute he gathered the four reg-
ulars and the two substitutes about him
boys you all know weve had the best
season ever and you all know this
mix-up with landon is going to be our
biggest and most important game-and
our hardest we want to win a little
worse than we want to go on living
he turned to vernon judd but
maybe you dont understand what i
mean judd of course youve only
been working here for five months and
you-

  pretty nearly six corrected vern
he had been marking them off on the
calendar in his room

  well anyhow unless youve been
through a basket-ball season with the
sporting-goods teams you cant know
how much it means to everybody in this
place to beat the landon bunch weve
got to do it understand everybody
that works here feels the same as col-
lege fellows feel about their team but
that aint all this game gets into every
sporting page of every big newspaper in
the country that means big advertis-
ing for the winners and advertising
-sport-page stuff in news-means bet-
ter business and better business means
more money to all of us-oh not a
lot maybe but every little bit helps
get me 

  i think i understand murph

 dont do no harm to tell you any-
how the people we work for want
us to win the people we work with
want us to win we want to win our-
selves the same as all real players do
and vern-he put his hand affection-
ately upon the young fellows jersey-
if you shoot baskets saturday night
the way you did just now we will win-
sure

  as vernon judd left the factorys
model gymnasium where the team had
been holding its final practice his body

tingled from the rough-towel rub that
followed the shower but he also tin-
gled internally from sheer pleasure and
the joy of living he had made good
coming into the bloss works practically
a nobody by merit alone he had won
friendship and respect as well as a
place on a cracking good basket-ball
five best of all for the first time in
his life he was really interested in the
business of earning a living

  life as a whole had changed for him
hard work in his department had
brought him a boost in the pay envelope
and his spare moments were busied with
a correspondence course in advertising
he wished his father could see him
jump out of bed before the winter sun
rose to hurry to a job that had become
a pleasure

  he was so busy patting himself on
the back that only chance prevented his
colliding with a footfarer bound the
other way

  hazel wayne he blurted as his
surprised glance showed him the girl
from landons whose acquaintance he
had made through the rescue of the
lace handkerchief

  her face was pale and troubled his
quick eye noted that she was holding
her library book almost ostentatiously

  practicing hard vern she queried
with a nervous little laugh do you
really think youre going to beat us sat-
urday 

  sure of it hazel youd better
order your mourning suit right now
as he turned to walk with her toward
the corner where the weldon park cars
passed it became growingly evident
that she was ill at ease

  whats the matter hazel  he asked
finally if you dont like something
ive said or done tell me what it was
and ill apologize

  she shook her head no she said
in a low voice no there-theres noth-
ing like that

  but somethings wrong what is it

weve been pretty good friends for
over five months now surely you can
tell me

  still she was silent

  is it creighton lie asked lightly
havent you changed your mind about
him yet do you still think hes a iow-
down- 

  ss-s-sh she put her hand over
his mouth dont-dont ever repeat
what i said about him-not to any-
body

  the weldon park car was bowling
nearer

  whats wrong hazel he asked
leaning closer tell me

  it was plain she was struggling with
herself twice she opened her mouth
as though to speak no she said
firmly in the end i-i havent any-
thing to say-nothing at all-except to
wish you luck to-morrow night thats
all

  thirty seconds later as vern watched
the car whirl around the corner into
moneta avenue his face bore a puz-
zled twist that was still in evidence after
a brisk walk had brought him back to
the factory entrance

  hello billy he greeted the night
watchman i left some correspond-
ence-school stuff in my locker i see
theres a light in the supes office so
it will be o k to pass me in

  with a grunt of assent old billy led
the way to the coat room and watched
vern take the leaflets from the locker
shelf partly deaf the watchman did
not heed the fragment of conversation
that floated down the corridor from
creightons open door

  its all right the superintendent
was saying monday night ends it
i tell you ive worked three months
getting things fixetl so i can tangle the
factory into a dozen knots just before
i-

  the voice trailed away into a confi-
dential whispering that vern could not
catch
the basket-ball boss



  vaguely the words disquieted him
was it possible that creighton was all
hazel wayne had said how could
she know hazel had never worked
in the bloss factory her job was in
the landon cashiers office and her
father and brother were employed in
the landon leather-working depart-
ment probably her distrust of creigh-
ton was a womans whim sprung of the
natural bitterness resulting from his
successful management of the rival fac-
tory but the boys suspicions were not
allayed at the sight of the superin-
tendents startled face when he mef
vern at the outer door

  what the devil are you doing here
demanded creighton with a worried
glance at his late visitor now turning
to trudge up the street

  verns answer seemed to reassure
him a little

  come back he said abruptly
come into my office i meant to have
a little talk with you to-morrow but we
might as well thresh it out now

  they sat down facing each other
judd said the superintendent you
like your job dont you

  vern responded with all the enthusi-
asm he could muster creighton cocked
his cigar in the corner of his mouth

  youve done well here youre get-
ting fifteen a week now and you are
in line to get more-he paused-if
you can keep your mouth shut and
obey orders

  the tone of the talk was objection-
able but vernon judds six months
were too nearly at an end for him to
object yes sir he said quietly i
want to advance of course

  creighton leaned forward judd
he confided theres one way for you
to hang on to your job-and only one
way the change in his voice was
startling

  what do you mean

  the superintendents heavy eyebrows
contracted in a sinister line the

bloss basket-ball team must lose to-
morrow night youve got to let lan-
don win understand you-not the
team but you-must see that the game
goes to them

  vern could hardly believe he had
heard correctly let landon win
you mean i- must throw the game
exactly im glad you understand
you know how to do it of course and
you can do it alone because you make
more baskets than all the rest of them
put together get hurt pretend youve
injured your arm i dont care how
you do it but throw the game re-
member i am your boss i am the boss
of the bloss basket-ball team if you
expect to hold your job here throw-
that-game

  vern tried to think quickly but-

dont you want-

  no i dont creighton stood up
glaring fiercely no no i want
the blosses to lose that game never
mind why thats none of your busi-
ness you want to hold your job all
right throw that game if you dont
the first thing ill do the following
monday morning will be to fire you
but i havent done anything to war-

  bah  what are you doing here this
time of night do you think the police
will take your word before they take
mine youve got folks somewhere
how will they like it when they hear
youve been hauled into a police station
for being a petty thief i can do it
all right and i will-if you dont throw
that game think it over dont try
to double cross me because it cant be
done thats all

  uneasy and troubled vernon judd
spent his trip to the boarding house
trying to figure out a solution for the
mystery what was the tangled un-
dercurrent was creighton doing all
this simply to win a few dollars by bet-
ting the notion was ridiculous then
what was the answer


wide-awake magazine

  on the table in the front hall of the
boarding house lay a note from his
father that thickened his difficulties it
had come by the late mail it ran

  dear veiw glad to learn from your let-
ter that youve been doing so well as long
as you have held out over five months al-
ready i am going to make this the test
win or lose this bloss job-that is the de-
ciding factor in our wager as to the stuff of
which you are made there is no reason
why you should be tired from bloss  com-
pany and you must not let yourself be fired
stay with them till the six months are up-
or dont come back	freeman judd

  vern crumpled the letter in his hand
a pretty mess he had gotten into all
his notions of honesty and sportsman-
ship recoiled at the thought of throw-
ing the game yet if he did not-

  br-r-r-r it was the boarding-
house telephone that roused him from
his reverie

  hello excuse me for disturbing
you but i must speak to mr judd

   oh is this you vern this is
hazel wayne speaking i must see you
now i did have something to tell you
before but i couldnt make myself say
it ive come all the way back to tell
it to you now i am at bakers drug
store just a block from your house
youll come right over vern wont
you 

 he buttoned his overcoat and
plunged out into the snowy night air
hazel was waiting for him just outside
the store and as he appeared she hur-
ried toward him

  vern i had to see you to-night i
hadnt been to the library when i met
you before id been waiting to talk to
you after you finished your basket-ball
practice but i was-afraid

  what is it he asked gently you
neednt be afraid to tell anything to me
hazel

  she winked back one tear but an-
other rolled down her cheek vern
you mustnt think the-the wrong way
about me but that basket-ball game to-

morrow night is a matter of life and
death-almost and your team mustnt
win you must let the landon five

beat you because- oh i cant tell

you why but you must do it-you must
for my sake vern

  she put both hands in his then be-
fore he could stop her she was plung-
ing blindly toward the car he watched
her as she stood a moment on the plat-
form shoulders shaking and a handker-
chief to her eyes

  boss father and girl all urging him
to betray his trust if he tried-if his
team won-he would lose his job his
chance to make something of himself
in the bigger business world and the
friendship of hazel wayne

  for the first time since he had known
her he realized that she was necessary
to his future happiness

iv

  as the referees whistle sent the
bloss and landon basket-ball teams
scurrying to their positions the follow-
ing evening hazel wayne leaned for-
ward with a quick intake of breath
the game was about to begin what-
ever the outcome might mean to the
workers and friends of the two fac-
tories it meant infinitely more to her
she told herself that the landon five
would win that it must win but she
could not stifle the fear in her heart

  well beat them said the girl at
her right a fellow worker in the lan-
don executive offices yes well beat

them if-

  -if vern judd doesnt score too

many baskets against us finished an-
other landon worker they say hes
a wonder

  they both nodded sagely the fear
in hazel waynes heart became a hys-
terical laugh of course and vern
wouldnt try too hard after what she
had told him surely he wouldnt
ready landon asked the referee
the basket-ball boss



ready bloss he shot the ball high
into the air piped a shrill blast on his
whistle as it began to descend and the
great game was on

  the two opposing centers leaped for
the yellow ball but vernon judd was
the quicker and the surer his right-
hand slapped it shooting it unerringly
to captain murphy  the thud hurt
hazel wayne like a blow

  dully despairingly she watched
murphy catch the ball and pass it to
clark who shot it clear across the court
to felber by this time judd was rac-
ing up the middle practically un-
guarded as the ball came to him in
a long driving throw he dropped it to
the floor lapped it closer to the basket
and then with a pretty toss looped it
upward and forward scoring the goal
at the end of the first minute the score
stood  bloss  landon o

  huddled forward in her balcony seat
at the other end of the gymnasium
hazel wayne allowed her breath to es-
cape with a gasp he was trying then 
he was playing his best perhaps
though this was only a flash to allay
suspicions she would wait a little
while before she condemned him

  again the opposing centers leaped
for the ball again vern shot it to a
member of his team this time how-
ever a lanky landon youth intercepted
the throw from murphy to clark and
the ball bounced out of bounds

  it was bloss throw-in and felber
left guard picked it up captain mur-
phy called a quick signal dodged un-
der the arm of the player who was
covering him and took the throw in
the extreme left-hand corner of the
court in landon territory the other
three players shifted to the boundary
lines vernon judd dodging free
sped down the middle of the unpro-
tected court

  hazel wayne watched him with fas-
cinated eyes she knew the play it
was the old crisscross forward pass

why didnt the landon boys cover
vern must he assume the entire re-
sponsibility for the failure at the end
for she told herself positively that he
would fail that he had done all they
might reasonably expect of him

  murphy threw gauging ball and
player to a nicety ten feet beyond
the center vern caught it while run-
ning at full speed then with a sin-
gle bewildering movement he lifted it
high above his head and shot another
basket with clean precision

  the score was now  bloss  lan-
don o the bloss adherents raised
the rafters with their mad cheering in
the little balcony at the other end hazel
wayne leaned back with clenched
hands

  he doesnt care enough for me to
do what i asked she told herself bit-
terly and she forced herself to smile
and nod when the girl at her right ex-
pressed the hope that something would
happen to vern judd before the game
was done she wished something would
-almost not a serious hurt of
course but-

  by the time the ball was in play
again the landon team seemed to have
found itself it reasoned rightly that
if the other four bloss players were to
act as feeders to judd counting on
him to shoot the baskets the thing to
do was to corner and pocket and guard
him so closely that he would have no
opportunity for unhampered throwing
so effectively did they carry out this
campaign that for ten minutes or more
he was hopelessly entangled in the mesh
of opposing players

  they went farther the bloss star
now began to bear the brunt of every
attack his arm was hacked on throws
he was tripped and fouled in all the ar-
tistic ways that could escape the eyes
of the official twice he went to the
floor with a crash and once he was
tumbled headfirst out of bounds

  but hazel wayne watching the


wide-awake magazine

game with the eye of an expert dared
hope there was another reason for ve-
non judds sudden eclipse and when
the bloss rooters began to move un-
easily as he failed to score goals and
shrunk back when he should have
charged and submitted tamely to an
opponents making a pass when he
should have scrimmaged for a toss-up
she grew more and more convinced
that he was no longer doing his best

  a little later the referee caught a
landon player fouling him and vern
took the ball for a free throw pois-
ing it carefully he shot it high in the
air a good five feet to one side of the
basket the bloss sympathizers mouths
open to cheer the scoring point allowed
them to close with dumb amazement
it wasnt even a good try

  now watch us  bragged the girl
by hazels side i heard this after-
noon that vern judd had sold out and
i guess he has

  hazel looked at her with troubled
eyes all at once she felt cold and sick
as if something terrible had happened

  it looks that way agreed the girl
on her left well every man has his
price sometimes its money some-
times business politics and sometimes

a woman i wonder- and she

glanced at hazel out of the tail of her
eye

  he-he wouldnt sell out hazel
told the girl weakly he isnt that
kind

  the other laughed meaningly isnt

he  oh i dont- look  look 

what do you think now

  vern had been clear for once the
ball came to him waist-high-and he
dropped it like a flash the captain
of the landon five caught it up and
shot it half the length of the court to
another player near the boundary line
he passed it to a third who scored a
neat goal on a side diagonal pass that
gave him the ball directly in front of
the basket

  the score was now bloss  lan-
don 

  a goal at last said one of the girls
sighing thanks to mr judd

  it was an accident defended ha-
zel angry without reason anybody
is apt to drop the ball now and then

  both teams scored again from the
field before the end of the first half
and during the last minute landon
crept closer on a palpable body-check
and free throw when the whistle
blew the score was bloss  lan-
don 

  the teams changed goals the bloss
basket was now at the balcony end
where hazel wayne could lean forward
and look straight down into it

  on the toss-up that began the sec-
ond half verns attempt to whack the
ball was so weak that it brought a hiss
or two from the spectators worse
still it made them watch him suspi-
ciously after that when he failed
twice on free throws and murphy took
his place after the next foul the crowd
began to mutter

  what do you think now about the
little angel named vern judd tri-
umphantly demanded the girl on hazels
right

  i-i dont want to talk please
said hazel she couldnt think she
couldnt understand her own emotions
or the wonderful metamorphosis of her
desires something had changed her
whole point of view the integrity of
vernon judd meant more to her all at
once than anything else in the world
indignant at first that he should play
so well when she had asked him not to
she was now praying that he would yet
do his best that he would strive to win
like a clean sportsman that he would
forget everything save his own honesty
and good name if he wasnt that kind

- she dared not complete the

thought

  the game wore on with varying for-
tunes players from first one team and
the basket-ball boss



then the other rushed the ball up and
down the court in zigzagging passes
tapping tossing dribbling shooting it
from man to man looping it for the
basket scrambling for it when it
missed and trotting back to their posi-
tions when a goal was scored

  eventually the landon five began to
assume the upper hand there was no
denying that its center outclassed vern
-or at least the vern who was play-
ing to-night he could throw better
he could block better with his arm he
could bat the ball better on the toss-
up because of these advantages lan-
don finally assumed the lead by the
slender margin of a single point in the
- score

  if i could only talk to him for a
minute hazel whispered to herself
watching the player fail in encounter
after encounter if i could tell him
to forget me and play-play i must
have been mad to ask him to sacrifice
himself for me

  she watched with staring eyes as
he whacked clumsily at the ball

  vern she called appealingly
vern

  but he couldnt hear her of course
the whole gymnasium was a babel of
confused shouts she could only lean
forward with her hands clutching the
balcony rail and follow him with her
eyes gloating when he broke free or
handled the ball wincing when oppo-
nents crashed into him and telling her-
self always that if the opportunity
offered he would prove his true char-
acter yet

  some official at the side of the court
made an announcement hazel could
not hear what he said and she turned
to a man behind her for the informa-
tion

  its the usual warning that there
are only three minutes more to play
he explained

  three minutes why it couldnt be
possible there must be some hideous

mistake only three minutes before
the game ended-and landon one point
ahead that meant unless some mir-
acle took place bloss was beaten-
beaten because a girl had asked a man
to forget honor for her sake

  she had no watch yet she must
time the game to its bitter encl the
torture of waiting constantly for the
final whistle without knowing what
moment it might come was too great
a strain to bear already her heart was
pounding-

  with a sudden inspiration she
dropped the finger tips of her right
hand upon the pulse of the other wrist
the normal heartbeat was a little over
seventy wasnt it that meant prac-
tically a surge of the artery for every
second

  she began to count-one two three
four five and so on up to the end of
the first minute out on the floor the
ten players were scurrying here and
there like frightened ants apparently
without aim or purpose but in reality
dodging and running with preconceived
plans but neither team scored again
nor did vern stand out conspicuously
in the playing

  the second minute measured itself
by her pulse beats now and then dur-
ing some tense moment her fingers
pressed so hard that she lost the steady
throb-throb of the wrist but she knew
within a second or two when the final
minute of play began

  the antlike players shifted toward
the bloss goal they were almost con-
stantly within throwing distance now
and one accurate toss would win a
dozen times the chance seemed to have
come but always there was some block-
ing landon opponent

  fifty-two fifty-three fifty-four
hazel went on mechanically then
with a convulsive start she realized
what the figures meant they were the
final grains of sand in the hourglass
her finger tips shook free of the wrist


wide-awake- magazine

and it was three seconds before they
pressed the pulse again

  fifty-eight fifty-nine sixty she
resumed her counting and lost the next
beat as her heart stopped with the shock
of apprehensive fear then she laughed
with nervous relief sixty pulse beats
werent quite a minute there were
from ten to fifteen still to record be-
fore the final whistle

  the ten players bunched just below
the balcony in front of the bloss goal
as if realizing that the game depended
upon their work during the next few
seconds they roused themselves above
their natural speed and skill

  five fighting to prevent another
basket hazel told herself and four
fighting just as hard to make it-no
five five he is trying i know he
is oh he must be but she could
not be quite sure

  she saw captain murphy whisper
something to him vern nodded
then so suddenly that she could
hardly follow the play the bloss team
scattered the ball catapulted to the
side of the court where the whacking
arm of felber drove it back and to-
ward the other end murphy caught
it whirled completely around to throw
off the guard hovering near him started
a dribble and finally made the pass
straight toward the landon goal

  hazel raised her eyes in wonder-
ment nearly halfway down the court
vern was sprinting a warning cry
from the captain made him turn on his
heel and throw up his hands but he
was an instant too late clean and
hard with the crack of a gun the ball
caught him full in the face staggering
him backward

  he stood there blinking like one who
has suddenly lost his sight the ball
was in his hands from all angles
the landon five rushed toward him
his own players shouted for the ball
his test had come hazel told herself
breathlessly then as he made no

move she stopped breathing alto-
gether

  her eyes were blurring with tears
she lifted her handkerchief to dry
them and saw that it was the square
of irish lace he had rescued the day
they first met

  vern she called putting all the
breath of her full lungs into the cry
vern

  he lifted his head his eyes were
winking rapidly and he had difficulty
in seeing her at all

  yern she called again leaning
far out over the protecting rail of the
balcony she allowed her handkerchief
to flutter down toward the basket be-
low it settled on the little ledge where
the bracket of the iron rim met the
wall

  there must have come to vernon
judd the memory of that other time
when he had arched a ball up and over
and down upon hazel waynes irish-
lace handkerchief perhaps the recol-
lection brought confidence in his ability
to do it again now with a swinging
overhand-loop shot he hurled the yel-
low basket ball at the white target

  like a winging swallow it rose till
it reached the apex of its arc then it
sped downward to the backing board
just behind the basket the rebound
drove it against the front rim it
bounded back again brushed the hand-
kerchief caressingly and finally toppled
gently into the netting for a goal al-
most on the instant the final whistle
shrilled

  the game was ended the bloss five
had won by a score of -

v

  judging by the expression on his
face vernon judd was about as elated
over scoring the winning basket for the
bloss team as a criminal in court would
be over receiving a stiff sentence

and thats just what it amounts to
the basket-ball boss

he told himself marching glumly off
the playing court my sentence is that
i be fired in disgrace from the fac-
tory lose my six-month test to prove
my right to a desk with judd  co
and sacrifice whatever chance i had of
winning-her

  somebody slapped him on the shoul-
der he looked up irritably only to
discover that it was his father

  why dad he greeted what in
the dickens are you doing out here
in town on business explained
freeman judd cryptically i heard
there was a basket-ball game to-night
and i figured i could find you here
quite a game eh 

  vern clenched his hands a bigger
more important one than you think
dad it was hard to go on and ex-
plain that his job at the factory hinged
upon the outcome but he managed it
bravely

  his father heard him to the end
without interrupting once or twice he
frowned a little as if there were some
worry on his mind but he offered no
comment when the boy was quite
done he looked at him steadily

  you played to win he asked

  of course you see i-

  all right i wanted to be sure
vern now about this job proposi-
tion of ours you wont stick out your
six months with bloss you say too
bad you came so close my boy but
you know i never budge an inch a
bargains a bargain with me

  looking up quickly vern fancied he
detected a twinkle in his fathers eyes
but when he searched for it again it
was gone

  im not asking you to go back on
your proposition he said i dont

know exactly-

  vern

  it was hazel waynes voice he
whirled quickly and took the hand she
extended

  i want to congratulate you with all

ca



my heart she said im glad you
won vern

  he was glad too-now it was the
first thrill of the victory but it was
well worth while some day he prom-
ised himself he would make hazel un-
derstand how much it had hurt him to
win against her wishes

  you dont know how ashamed of
myself i felt she rushed on you
see creighton met me yesterday and
told me he was coming over to lan-

dons as superintendent and-

  creighton at laixlons  ex-
claimed vern in astonishment a new
hope sprang up in his heart when
next tuesday he said

  oh the hope withered and died
on the intervening monday creighton
would discharge him go on hazel
well continued the girl he ex-
plained that as he had already signed
his contract and was the landon man-
ager he wanted the landon people to
have the winning basket-ball team this
season if you didnt try too hard
vern that would be possible he
thought i-i was to ask you not to
but-why

  because if i refused-if bloss won
-i was to lose my job fathers and
brother bens depended upon the game
too tuesday well all be out of work
i dont know how well manage to live
but-she smiled at him through her
tears-but im glad you won vern
it nearly killed me when i thought you
werent trying honestly to win

  i was hazel i know a lot of peo-
ple didnt think so but i was he
touched his arm gingerly early in the
game i bruised the biceps in my right
arm in a nasty tumble my whole arm
got sore and stiff i wanted to drop out
and make way for a substitute but
murph wouldnt listen and then at
the end just before i scored that last
goal tle ball hit me an awful whack in
the face it stunned me and blinded
me but i heard you call and i caught


wide-awake magazine

a glimpse of your white handkerchief
dropping i remembered that other day
-the first day i ever saw you-and i
knew absolutely i could shoot the bas-
ket you really won the-

  listen hazel wayne the voice
ivas creightons his face was con-
vulsed with rage listen to me young
lady  you double-crossed me to-night
but youll pay for it out you go tues-
day along with your old man and your
kid brother-the whole kit and parcel
of you and ill see to it that you
never get another job in this town
he turned to vern as for you you
young whippersnapper i dont have
to wait till tuesday youre fired
understand fired just as soon as

i can swear out a warrant-

  freeman judd stepped forward lei-
surely just a moment he inter-
rupted you cant fire this young
man

  why not im superintendent of
the bloss company

  wrong the elder judd spat out
the word with evident enjoyment you
zvere superintendent but you cant
fire anybody now because you were
fired yourself this afternoon at a meet-
ing of the board of directors

  its a lie blustered creighton his
eyes gleamed slyly if it aint a lie
though i dont care ill be super-
intendent of the landon works next
week and the bloss company will

find-

 wrong again freeman judd
stepped closer at five this afternoon
the final papers were signed whereby
the two concerns come under the same
management and ownership if its of
any interest to you i am the man who
is merging them i kicked you out of

bloss to-day after reading the reports
of an expert accountant and a detec-
tive whove been checking you up for
several weeks ill make sure you stay
out of landons so mr creighton
jou see you wont be able to fire any-
body from either factory

  creighton did not wait to argue
with a sudden leap he lost himself in
the crowd that was making for the
outer door

  shall i go after him dad asked
vern his fingers working hungrily

  no need smiled freeman judd
hell run across some plain-clothes
men just outside misappropriation of
funds malicious damage of property
and other charges to answer in court
somebody plucked at verns coat
sleeve and he looked down into hazels
startled eyes

  is he your father she asked point-
ing

 why yes let me introduce-

  but lies just bought both factories
she said and he must be very rich
and-and i thought you were poor
working in the bloss stockroom i sup-
pose now-

ing ill stick to my same job promised
vern  at least till ive been there a
full six months how about it dad
vern im going to like you better

cause to tell the truth im thinking

  the frobisher producing company
with clem as its head and ed davis
as partner and scenario writer had
been established in easthamplon for

some months further it had made
good largely because of clem frobish-
ers distinctive ability

  before getting into the motion-pic-
ture business clem had run a fishing
launch out of san pedro ed being his
engineer and chum he had finaily
awakened to the fact that despite his
splendid body anti brawn he was back-
ward in education that ahead of him
lay nothing but endless years of fishing
and taking out tourists after tuna and
that if he so chose he could make
something more of himself than this

  clem had chosen promptly had sold
his launch to old captain saunders and
had started in to make the fight ham-
pered financially and by lack of prior
education he had none the less flung
himself into the work with all his dog-
ged pugnacious will power ed davis
had accompanied him largely for
friendships sake but also with the
dream of getting rich by writing plays

  events had favored the chums ed
had been victimized by a fraudulent rno-
tion-picture concern whereupon clem
had pitched in and fought the owners
the result had been that he and ed
davis owned the film company since
that time the chums had worked it up
until now it was really a well-estab-
lished business with a golden future

  naturally therefore they were both


wide-awake magazine

ready for a vacation clem quite for-
got that a man and particularly a young
man can never entirely get away from
his past

  in the old days clem had had a repu-
tation along the pedro water front

  fie had never been a hanger-on at
bars or a pool-room loafer but nature
combined with hard work at sea had
endowed him with a vigorous body and
an inclination to use his fists along
the water front he had been thrown in
contact with fishermen bucko mates
and ordinary seamen of all nations and
when it came to fighting clem frobish-
ers name was one to conjure with

  he had been whipped of course yet
he was locally known as the toughest
young fellow to whip and the best fel-
low to stand beside in a scrap in all
san pedro and it must be admitted
that he did his best to justify the repu-
tation not that he ever sought a fight
or forced one on the other chap but
when the fight came to him he went into
it on the jump

  clem had thought these old days gone
forever but as he and ed davis
climbed aboard their san pedro car that
afternoon fate was waiting for them
with a big stick

ii

  if capn saunders aint here said
ed davis well get another boat

  clem nodded together they were
walking up a side street of san pedro
to the little cottage where captain ezra
saunders a retired veteran of many
seas and seasons was living on the in-
come furnished him by two or three
fishing boats which were run by his
son tom a young fellow a year or two
older than clem

  as they turned in at the gate of the
vine-shaded cottage however they
knew that the captain was at home from
the foghorn voice which bellowed
forth

  plowdy clem

  ezra saunders was a remarkable old
man-though he was scarce sixty years
of age fie was crippled by rheuma-
tism and had lost a leg at the knee from
a sharkbite while his right arm had
been paralyzed on his last voyage-
when he had brought the schooner
mary connors through a thousand miles
of typhoon and had saved the lives of
twenty men

  with all this however clem had
never seen the old man in gloomy mood
ever was captain saunders smiling op-
timistic cheerful as he and ed davis
shook hands and stepped tip to the
porch where easy-chairs awaited them
the skipper bellowed to his wife and
mrs saunders also came forth to fold
each of the visitors in a warm embrace

  well well she exclaimed wiping
a tear from her ruddy cheeks clem
if you aint become a real city man
say wouldnt your mother ha been
proud of you now

  i hope so and clems brown eyes
saddened a trifle since his mothers
death mrs saunders had been the only
mother he had known-and that had
been twelve summers past then he
looked up with his old cheerful smile
i do believe youre getting thin

  nonsense you vagabone mrs
saunders who weighed two hundred
and knew it laughed through her wel-
coming tears dont you flatter me
now you boys aint goin to run right
off i hope i been makin pies to-day
and it seems to me you two rapscallions
used to like ma saunders pies right
well before you got stuck up an citi-
fied

  nothin stuck up about me cept
my collar said ed davis grinning
i been hankering for your pies ma
ever since we left pedro you bet were
goin to stay a while hows tom
everybody well

  mrs saunders ruddy face seemed to
assume a slightly less cheerful expres-
sion
clem frobishers man-sized job



  yes she said turning to the door
toms well you folks set and talk
while i see to them pies theyre in
the oven now

  the door slammed clem looked at
the captains white-whiskered face and
frowned

  whats the matter capn he asked
directly youre looking kind of
peaked around the gills rheumatism
bad again

 no-o i reckon not captain
saunders stroked his beard and sum-
moned up the ghost of his olden-days
smile im hungerin for salt water
i reckon

  first time i ever knew you to lie to
me capn said clem quietly

  captain saunders flushed he looked
at ed davis and then met clems accus-
ing brown eyes with fumbling lingers
he began to fill his pipe

  got a match clem he asked with
a little quaver in his voice

  silently clem produced the article in
question it began to seem as though
something were very wrong indeed
ed davis sat watching and listening his
grin gone when the old skipper had
lighted the pipe he leaned back and
looked at clem again

  well clem i-i guess it was the
first time i aint much used to lies
but sometimes lies has to come

  not between us capn and clems
strong bronzed face lightened whats
the trouble

  you said the old man puffing out
a huge cloud of smoke

  i what do you mean

 captain saunders sighed his
weather-beaten face was set in lines of
sadness

  clem you alius been a mighty good
boy and i know it bettern most people
but when it comes to a scrap you got
a reputation around here like a down-
east mate i dont blame you none o
course

  go on urged clem as the skipper

paused he wondered what was com-
ing next

  well tom alius did admire you a
heap clem but since you been gone to
the city toms kind o got the notion
that hes stepped into your fightin
boots and hes gone around handin out
some line lickins for a fact tom can
fight like a streak

   guess he came by it honestly was
the reply and clem smiled slightly as
he eyed the old skippers broad shoul-
ders

  well mebbe so but-sav clem
you know toms a good boy dont
you

  you bet he is said clem frown-
ing

  inwardly he commented otherwise
while he knew tom saunders pretty
well he also knew that tom had com-
panions who were not of the old saun-
ders strain

  to tell the truth clem toms been
gettin kind o out o hand the skip-
per sighed again hes been cornin
home drunk every once in a while if
you want it straight hes try in to be
cock o the walk around here like you
used to be-but he aint doing it your
way clem

  clem frobisher felt as though a cold
hand had touched him and had sent a
shiver through him

  he was not responsible of course
and very likely tom saunders was no
worse than the average young fellow
but that was far from the point

  clem loved the honest simple manly
old skipper and he loved mrs saun-
ders sooner than hurt them in any
way he would have cut off his right
hand

  yet he knew that he had hurt them
grievously if unintentionally he knew
that tom saunders misled by the
wrong sort of friends was heaping sor-
rows upon these kindly old parents of
his largely by aspiring to walk in the
tracks of clem frobisher and ezra


wide-awake magazine

saunders had hit the nail on the head
by saying that tom was not doing it
clems way

  hes running the boats all right i
suppose queried clem with sinking
heart

  oh he tends to em well enough-
nothin extra clem i wish to thunder
these was the ol days id ship that
boy a b under the toughest hardest
pair o bucko mates ever stepped an
id ship him around the horn when
he got back by glory hed either be
dead or-or different and-the skip-
per sighed heavily-i dunnos id give
a durn which way it come out i blieve
its breakin ma saunders heart-i do
so

  suddenly ed davis leaned forward
his lean frame quivering with eager-
ness for five minutes he spoke rap-
idly excitedly earnestly clem and the
skipper listened in amazement that
changed on clems part to narrow-
eyed calculation and finally to swift re-
solve

  thats enough he broke in sud-
denly capn well go out on a fishin
trip in the old sadie after supper to-
night if tom aint-hasnt-come
home ill find him and i promise you
this on my word of honor if i dont
change his lookout on life ill never
show my face here again

  the old skipper gazed at clem with
dewy eyes

  clem he said brokenly clem
mebbe ye can but lad its a man-sized
job i reckon youve bit off moren ye
can chew-but heaven bless ye lad

  and now for mas pies said ed
davis with a grin

iii

  clem frobisher and his chum waved
farewell to the old folks and walked
toward beacon street the california
evening was just closing down in all its
swiftness

  ed you go tend to the boat di-
rected clem at the next corner have
her gas tank full and make sure the
batteries are working right ill bring
tom

  mebbe id better go along with
you volunteered ed

  maybe youd better obey orders
snapped clem his square-hewn face set
in hard determined lines here  take
my coat with you 

  peeling to his flannel shirt he tossed
his coat to ed and turned away the
other looked after him with a sour grin

  want all the fun yourself eh all
right capn you aint goin to shake
me 

  ed davis followed his partner-at a
very respectful distance

  clem strode along in the gathering
dusk crossing beacon street he
headed for a large pool room where he
was pretty certain to find his quarry

  so he didnt come home for supper
-hasnt come home all day he mut-
tered savagely huh claims to be
walking in my shoes does he huh

  clem turned in at the pool-room en-
trance where a noisy phonograph was
grinding out ragtime about the rear
of the place he saw a dozen young fel-
lows grouped about a pool table with a
cloud of tobacco smoke hanging over
them with a curt nod to the proprie-
tor clem strode back past the tables

  he soon picked out tom saunders a
big-boned rathar handsome fellow
three inches taller than clem and built
along the same lines as the old skipper
but tonis strong even powerful face
was marred by the undeniable touch of
liquor and a cigarette trailed smoke be-
tween his fingers his companions
laughed uproariously at his jokes and
gave him an acclamation which he
seemed to enjoy hugely

  clem frobisher by golly

  as the cry went up from the assem-
bled fellows all of whom knew clem
tom saunders turned and came for-
clem frobishers man-sized job



ward cue in hand with a quick smile
of delight he stretched out a big hand
toward clem

  hello capn say you old chump

where you been hidin  i-

  under clems steady scornful gaze
his words of greeting faded his hand
fell to his side he stared in blank
amazement while a portentous silence
fell upon the others

  then clem made a sudden movement
and plucked the cigarette from toms
fingers he tossed it into the corner

  tom he said quietly i hear that
you claim to be filling my shoes how
about it

  hey tom saunders laid aside
his billiard cue still staring what
you mean

 you heard me snarled clem
watching the other with grim intent-
ness

  say whats eatin you demanded
tom in frowning wonder aint we
alius been mighty good friends what
the devil are you talkin about

  im talking about you said clem
as he took a forward step tom you
used to be a prince of a fellow youre
some scrapping guy too well i been
hearing a lot about you to-day i hear
for one thing that youre doing a lot o
talking about fillin clem frobishers
shoes im telling you right here that
my shoes never left tracks in a saloon
get that

  say whats the matter with you
said tom with a scowl seeing beyond
all doubt that his former hero was bent
on trouble do you want to start
somethin 

  when i get ready ill start it quick
enough snapped clem ed davis
came over with me and were going out
in the sadie to-night tom on a three-
days trip-maybe longer i want you
to come along

  tom was puzzled by this invitation
and was also half mollified

  why clem id like to-darned if

i wouldnt but we got a big kelly
game coinin oil to-night-dollar a cor-
ner-

  and your dads house rent is ow-
ing said clem quietly will you
come or not

  dont see how i can-

  like a flash clems right shot out

it drove fair and square to the big fel-
lows jaw tom went staggering back
and his friends surged forward at clem
with a snarl of rage gripping the pool
table behind him tom saunders turned
on them hotly

  git back you flatfoots keep out o
this

  bully for you tom said clem ap- 
provingly then as tom turned clem
was in with a leap and the row began

  and as a water-front row it was
historic tom saunders was  bluffer
he had size and brawn he took punish-
ment like a punching bag and he had a
kick like a mule when he started in
to fight he usually demolished every-
thing in sight

  but from the start it was evident that
he had no chance

  clem frobisher in action was a whirl-
wind if he lacked size he had a sav-
age earnestness which won half his bat-
tles he went into a scrap heart and
soul and body for if he had to fight he
wanted no halfway measures he was
not a halfway man

  the battle was short sharp and furi-
ous foolishly tom drove for clems
face and jaw but clem fought other-
wise he was out for blood figuratively
speaking

  taking a smack that brought a
black eye without a wince he broke
through the others guard and slammed
his fists into toms body time and again
never had any one seen him go into a
fight with such savage deadly fury
within thirty seconds tom saunders
was backed into a corner mouthing
oaths and lashing out half at random
while clems terrible right and left


wide-awake magazine

swings pounded over his heart and
stomach

  unexpectedly clem shot up a swift
uppercut that rocked toms head back
the others arms flew up and clems
right bored into the solar plexus it
was almost a finishing blow tom emit-
ted a gasp and flung out his arms to
save himself from going down clem
swung down his arm for the knock-
out

  at that instant the rage of toms
followers broke all bounds one of
them came in swinging a billiard cue
and aimed a blow that would have re-
sulted in the penitentiary had it landed
but it did not land

  as the cue flashed up behind clem a
lean figure came from nowhere appar-
ently and placed a blow under the fel-
lows ear that landed the would-be mur-
derer under a table and kept him there
then clem heard his chums voice ring-
ing behind him

  you fellers better scatter quick
theres two cops headed this way
clems arm shot out tom saunders
groaned and collapsed the others
were hastily streaming out the back en-
trance and clem gripping his late op-
ponents collar turned to ed davis with
a panting gasp of relief

  good boy ed pick up his feet
now-move fast

  and as the police entered by the
front door they vanished into the alley
at the rear carrying the unconscious
tom saunders between them

iv

  shanghaied him by thunder

  ed davis grinned down at the sleep-
ing tom the sadie was dancing to
the lilting ground swells at dawn far
out beyond catalina island

  below there rang the voice of
clem on deck above ed rouse that
fellow up or ill do it myself

ed who was about to turn in after

standing watch all night shrugged his
shoulders and grinned then he caught
the sleeping tom saunders by the leg
hauled him roughly out of the bunk
and planting two stinging blows sent
him up the tiny companionway with a
kick

  furious half awake cursing saun-
ders gained his balance on the deck and
stared at the ocean in blank bewilder-
ment clem at the wheel let out a
roar

  wake up you slob take one o
them buckets and a broom an wash
down the decks

  tom stared at the pilot house saw
clems battered features and compre-
hended at last his heavy face con-
tracted in anger

  by thunder ill make you sweat for
this he burst forth and came on the
run

  clem slipped a loop over the wheel
and met tom halfway nor did he
waste any time or sympathy for he was
a captain and his crew was in mutiny
before tom could get within fighting
distance clem smashed him across the
head with the butt end of a gaff he
reeled back caught at the rail and
clung there weakly

  ive a word to say to you tom
saunders remarked clem quietly
watching him for signs of further trou-
ble you think youre something of
a boss scrapper and a deuce of a sporty
chap youre not youre a cheap
low-down drunken loafer

  you keep away from your old father
and mother as much as you can and
you loaf around the water front gam-
bling and fighting and drinking well
youre going to get your fill o fighting
this trip believe me youre going to
realize that you got a blamed sight bet-
ter home than any pool room will fur-
nish-

  tom partly recovered from that
stunning blow leaped in again

  clem raised the gaff then dropped it
clem frobishers man-sized job



he saw that tom was a glutton for
punishment and determined to admin-
ister it yet he admired deeply the dog-
ged courage of the other

  cool confident smiling for a good
ten minutes he smashed tom saunders
about the deck at the end of that time
tom collapsed both eyes puffing and
his face hammered black and blue
clem caught up a canvas bucket trailed
it over the side and sluiced tom with
cold salt water until tom sat up gasp-
ing and half drowned

  if youve had enough get busy and
clean them decks snapped clem

  tom had not had enough as his
curses showed but he set to work clean-
ing the decks during breakfast he
eyed clem in sullen silence and after
breakfast clem set him to work clean-
ing out the fish boxes and untangling
lines and leaders

  shortly afterward clem caught sight
of a flock of gulls far to the south and
headed the sadie for them where the
gulls were there were yellowtail and
skipjack also calling tom he put him
to work at the outriggers

  these were long ten-foot poles set
into sockets just abaft the pilot house
and projecting over the rails from
each pole were set out three hundred-
yard lines the outermost of which bore
automatic strikers the others bearing
hooks and minnows

  five minutes later they got the first
strike and then the fun waxed fast and
furious clem let out a yell for ed
davis and they began to haul in fifteen
and twenty-pound yellowtail as fast as
the trolling lines could be drawn taut
as clem and tom hauled in the fight-
ing darting leaping fish ed gaffed
them

  by noon they had over twenty with
a few barracuda and skipjacks then
clem hauled about for san clemente
looped the wheel and settled down with
the others to lunch

  when you get the dishes washed

up tom said ed davis youd better
clean one of them barracuda for supper
then give that cabin a good cleaning

and then-

  say you fellers are almighty
fresh said tom saunders feeling his
black-and-blue eyes tenderly how
long is this thing goin to last

  until we get ready to quit said
davis grinning pleasantly your
proud spirit needs a whole lot o chas-
tening friend tom

  w ell whats the idea what have
i ever done to you guys

  nothing broke in clem coldly
but youre becoming a pretty worth-
less sort of citizen tom if i had a
father and mother like yours id try
and make something of myself instead

of hanging around-

  yes youre a beaut sneered tom
 cause youre a city guy now youre
all stuck up hey

  i dont think you quite under-
stand clem smiled slightly youre
out of proportion with the real facts
of life tom your outlook is warped
instead of seeing things as they are
you see them from the viewpoint of
your pool-room and saloon friends
well when we get back to pedro youll
have forgotten all your dreams of be-
ing a tough fighter and gambler and
drinker youre really such a splendid

chap at bottom tom-

  with a snarl of fury tom saunders
leaped to his feet unobserved he had
worked himself into position by the rack
holding the fish gaffs with the rapid-
ity of lightning he seized one of the
ten-foot poles and made a vicious lunge
for clem

  clem ducked the curved sharp
unbarbed steel missed his shoulder by
a hairs breadth and tore through his
flannel shirt it would have gone
through his flesh quite as easily

  before tom could extricate the
weapon ed davis was on him in one
leap


wide-awake magazine

  let it be understood that it was con-
trary to the natures both of davis and
of clem frobisher to treat any one with
the brutality which they were display-
ing toward tom saunders yet it was
not brutality they were both thinking
not of tom but of the two old people
in the vine-wreathed cottage

  ed had mapped out a course clem
had approved it as had captain ezra
saunders and now the two partners
were following it rigidly if it turned
out badly tom would get no more than
he deserved if it turned out well so
much the better

  blinded though he was however
tom gave the lanky iowan the light of
his life it was full seven minutes before
ed had his opponent on the deck and
even then tom still lashed out blindly
at the figure sitting on his chest not
until clem doused him anew with
bucket after bucket of water did he
give in

  all right he mumbled rising un-
steadily all right you guys wait
till i can see thats all

  theres no waiting aboard this
hooker snapped clem you get for-
ard and clean that fish and do it right
see

  ill do nothin o the sort returned
tom through his split lips you can
beat me up all you want-i aint goin
to stir a foot a volley of oaths es-
caped him

  clem his lips tight clenched in-
spected him for a moment then turned
to ed

  get that bit of line out o the locker
aft ed-the ropes end thats tarred
go after this guy and give him a taste
of deep-sea sailors life

  for the rest of the afternoon tom
saunders worked like a horse a bit
of thin rope tarred into a stiff club is
a wonderfully effective inducement
when properly applied poor tom
made close acquaintance with it

  well be off san clemente at dawn
ed said clem that evening he and
ed davis were eating fried barracuda
while tom conned the helm itll be
watch and watch all night and well
have to keep him awake and working
till he drops

  haze him eh

  haze him until hes darned near
dead and clem compressed his lips
ed its an awful thing to do-but by
golly its a whole lot more awful to
think o him breakin poor old ma saun-
ders heart

  well break him said ed nodding
as he spoke well kill or cure clem
-and i aint right sure which itll be

  neither was clem unfortunately

v

  dawn came upon the sea-and fog

  the sadie was somewhere off san
clemente that desolate rocky almost
unknown island the dense fog hid
everything from view

  clem who would be on duty until
eight oclock was seated beside the pilot
house cutting off yellowtail heads to
use as bait for jewfish the sadie lay
motionless on the oily waters swinging
listlessly to the swell of the channel
up in the bows was a huddled miser-
able figure-tom saunders asleep at
last

  that had been a terrible night for the
shanghaied man

  kept awake and at work kept scrub-
bing painting untangling lines oiling
the engines driven to the work and kept
at it by boot and fist and ropes end
tom had finally given way

  when clem took the deck at four
oclock the sight of tom smote his
heart yet he drove him relentlessly
an hour later the end had come

  sobbing praying pleading tom had
crept to him begging for sleep begging
for release from the torture even
then clem had steeled himself and
clem frobishers man-sized job



had renewed his driving but not for
long he had not the heart

  tom saunders had been broken at
last---had promised everything and any-
thing had wept and prayed anew at
six oclock clem had told him to sleep
and he had dropped in a pitiable heap
where he stood

  its a mean job thought clem as
he baited the huge hooks on his line
but hes had an hours rest now so
well try him out besides he can
stand a lot more-and its necessary
kill or cure

  accordingly he awakened poor torn
by repeated sluices of water thrust a
rod into his hand bade him angle for a
jewfish and baited his own line some-
what to clems surprise tom said noth-
ing whatever and did not rebel but he
sat on the rail shivering and gazed
miserably at the water

  a moment later just as clem was
unreeling his line he saw tom start
to his feet and heard the buzz of the
automatic drag

  got one he cried tom merely
nodded

  a glance showed clem that the jew-
fish was running out ahead of the
launch and he leaped to the engines

  ill give her half speed he ex-
claimed swiftly reel up as we get
over him

  he noted that the fog seemed to have
thickened rather than diminished

  with the sadie running slowly ahead
clem regained the deck to find tom
reeling in his line the stubby powerful
rod bent almost double the jewfish
for all its great size is not a wonderful
fighter none the less it was a good ten
minutes before tom got the fish close to
the surface

  yet he seemed not a whit excited
he reeled mechanically his hands were
blue with cold he seemed broken in
spirit clem watched him with some
anxiety wondering if the hazing had
been carried too far

  here he exclaimed suddenly as
the line came in take this gaff and
bring him up tom ill hold him at
the surface

  clem thought he saw tears on the
others cheeks

  the exchange was made tom took
the gaff and stood on the rail clinging
to a stay bending over the water clem
taking the rod was astonished the
fish must be a four-hundred-pounder at
least he decided then peering over
the side as he forced the jewfish up he
saw the great oval mass below the
surface water broke into a mass of
foam

  tom lunged with the gaff-lunged
again-missed both times then with
a muttered word of exasperation he
leaned far over and caught the fish
squarely

  he did not lift quickly enough how-
ever to get the fish out of water there
was a surge and a swirl beneath and a
short cry broke from tom

 give me a hand-

  before clem could move he saw
tom hanging grimly to the gaff drawn
out by the fishs wide circling sweep
in a flash the dogged san pedro boy
had his hold broken had lost his bal-
ance-and was overboard

  by golly hes too cold and stiff to
swim  thought clem swiftly he lifted
his voice in a ringing shout

 ed ed on deck man over-
board 

  with the words he caught up the
life preserver hanging at the rail and
tossed it over the side then his coat
off he leaped after it in wild fear lest
his own driving tyranny had been car-
ried so far that tom would have no
strength left

  in that desperate fear he came to the
surface almost beside the struggling fig-
ure of tom saunders a few yards
away was floating the round life buoy
catching tom by the collar clem


wide-awake magazine

gained the preserver in a few strokes
and bobbed tom up inside it

  get your arms over the sides-thats
right now take a turn of the line
about your arms good

  satisfied that tom was sure to float
clem turned on his side and sent a
glance around for the sadie with a
shock he remembered that her engines
were set at half speed

  she was gone in the fog

  stilling the momentary panic that
seized him clem lifted his voice in a
shout he knew that ed davis would
be on deck by this time but at sight
of the swirls of fog that hid the water
ten feet away his heart sank

  how you makiu it tom

  all right said the other mechani-
cally i lost the fish i guess

  i guess you did clem chuckled
can you give a yell 

  tom emitted a feeble cry that be-
trayed his weakness more than words
could have done a wave broke over
them and clem took his weight off the
preserver allowing it to float higher
it could not well sustain them both

  also there was a choppy sea run-
ning-the island current cutting up the
long easy ground swell it was hard
swimming and the water was cold

  what on earths the matter with
ed exclaimed clem anxiously we

ought to hear the horn- ah  there

it is thank goodness

  muffled but unmistakable the blast
of the sadies foghorn pierced its way
to them clem shouted again and
again ed was on the job

  it dont seem to be gettin much
closer muttered tom

  clem listened no-it was not grow-
ing closer it was hard to tel from
which direction the sound came but
certainly the launch was receding from
them resting once more on the life
preserver clem bellowed for all he was
worth

  better quit yellin mumbled tom
itll lire you out quickern any-

  the rest was lost in a splutter as a
wave lapped over them clem again re-
leased the life buoy which lifted tom
well above the water

  ridding himself of his clothes clem
swam more easily but he felt the chill
of the water keenly owing to the
choppy back lash of the waves it was
impossible to float he had to swim
continually to hold himself up

  hang on to the cork ye blamed
fool said tom

  i will if i need to im all right

  the horn was sounding no longer

  clem knew that their situation was
desperate in the extreme which way
the island lay no one could tell they
were in a spot reached only by an oc-
casional fishing boat the fog would
not lift before noon unless ed davis
found them by chance they could not
both last-the preserver would only
keep one man up

  clem found himself becoming weak-
ened by that continual struggle

  how long he swam beside tom he
never knew it seemed like days he
swam now on his side now on his back
change position as he might however
he could not get away from the choppy
short seas the sound of the foghorn
came to them no more and clem for-
bore to shout knowing the effort use-
less unless ed davis came close by
them

  how are you tom he said rest-
ing on the preserver a wave broke
over them clem hastily drew away
yet with an inward groan

  all right responded tom lying
nobly catch on here

  clem smiled a little the faintness
of the others voice had told him all
he wanted to know tom was incapable
of any exertion

  and i m responsible for toms con-
dition was the thought that drove into
clems heart with paralyzing truth he


clem frobishers man-sized job 

called up his reserve strength and
breasted the waves but the effort
wasted him alarmingly his limbs were
stiff numbed he prayed for the sa-
die but she came not

  tom said clem as he turned
swimming beside the buoy and watch-
ing toms white stern-clenched face
weve hazed you pretty hard this trip
but it was for your own good ed and

i came to pedro and found- a

wave plunged over him clem fought
it down gasping

  we found your dad ten years older
than he was a month or two ago ma
didnt say much but she was pretty
hard hit-and it was your fault tom
youve been running with the wrong
crowd and because youre a good deal
above them in every way theyve toad-

gazed at tom with desperate convulsed
features fie knew he could not last

terrible weakness overpower him then
he caught a breath of blessed air again

so long-cut out-the booze-

 with a groan clem found his
strength gone he seemed to collapse
utterly fie felt the water close over
him choking strangling smothering-
and then he knew nothing more

  a moment afterward the sadie poked
her nose out of the fog almost above
tom

  with a mutter of self-accusation ed
rushed away

  clem lay in a coma of exhaustion
he felt a gradual warmth steal through
him and realized that he was safe
enough but he was too weary to move
a moment later he caught a step at his
side and opened his eyes thinking that
ed had returned

  instead however he saw tom saun-
ders the big fellow staring at clem
with wild eyes lowered himself to the
edge of the bunk he was white and
shaken as he met the gaze of clem
he broke down and lowered his face
in his arms sobbing unrestrainedly

  clem wondered but was too weak to
speak for the moment at length tom
lifted his head

of ed davis who had paused for a mo-
ment behind tom listening

  he came forward with two steaming
cups of coffee handed one to tom and

entombed miners rescued

the nine miners who had been entombed for a week in the foster tunnel
of the lehigh coal  navigation company at coaldale pennsylvania
were taken out alive though the men had crouched in water most of
the time and had subsisted partly on wax they were able to walk to the
ambulance

    eleven miners were entombed when water and culm broke into the tunnel
two who were nearer the mouth of the tunnel were saved after a few hours
gangs working in relays of four hours dug through the fallen coal and rock
in order to make an opening through which the other nine could be rescued

hen rube- reynolds
crawled out of bed and
began to dress it was
near to noontime within
his head to all feeling a
gigantic throbbing trip
hammer was seemingly
striving to pound its way
through his skull with regular painful
thumps his lips felt parched and
drawn and a sickish bitter taste stayed
upon his tongue as if his mouth was
crammed with coarse moldy earth and
by no means of futile gulping could he
swallow the stuff

  out of the confused muddle of his
brain flashed a thought of morning
practice

  guessll have to skip breakfast to
get out to the field on time he thought

  but a glance at his watch lying upon
the bureau made him aware that haste
was useless for probably at that mo-
ment his fellow members of the sox
were leaving the ball park for their
homes and boarding places again he
had missed a morning session on the
home grounds of the sox and he sul-
lenly wondered what manager kineally
would say

  slowly he continued to don his
clothes at times the bed the chairs
and other articles of furniture seemed
to be dancing and whirling weirdly
about the room and when he leaned
forward to lace his shoes his throbbing
head pained as though it would burst

  moving to the bureau he pulled out
a lower drawer and brought forth a

bottle partially filled with a brownish
liquid to his lips he tipped it and
for several seconds his adams apple
bobbed convulsively to a gurgling ac-
companiment

  barely at the halfway mark between
twenty and thirty years reynolds had
already reached the stage where a
morning drink seemed a necessity he
lowered the bottle its contents emptied
by half to the bureau top and an arti-
ficial sense of buoyancy pervaded his
being the throbbing pain in his head
was deadened to a dull ache and the
burning flavor of the liquor upon his
tongue had washed away the moldy
taste

  he dully pondered as to what had
taken place on the previous evening
but his remembrances of events occur-
ring after eleven oclock or thereabouts
on the night before were decidedly lim-
ited some one had escorted him to the
front door of his lodging house he had
dizzily ascended the stairs and managed
to open the door of his room-that was
all he could recall

  a gentle tapping on the door broke
in upon his thoughts

  what is it he grunted

  mr kineally wishes to see you
was the reply the voice belonged to
his landlady

  reynolds hesitated momentarily he
was tempted to have the landlady say
that he was not at home but what
was the use kineally would bawl
him out later so why not have it over
with


wide-awake magazine

  all right send him up reynolds
answered

  he had hardly time to whisk the bot-
tle from the bureau to its place in the
drawer when an imperative rapping
threatened the door panel

  come in  he called

  as the door swung inward a big
brawny form filled the doorway almost
from casing to casing the square-
jawed visage of owen kineally with
its twinkling eyes and smiling lips had
appeared on sporting pages the country
over but now the smile was missing
his eyebrows were puckered forward
as reynolds had sometimes seen them
when kineally took a parting shot at a
nearsighted obstinate umpire

  the big manager remained standing
his gaze upon the ball player

  g morning reynolds greeted as
he continued the knotting of his scarf

  good afternoon retorted the man-
ager and he added youre fined
fifty dollars

  reynolds whirled about

  what for he demanded his voice
raised to nearly a shout

  for not showing up at morning
practice and for drunkenness last night
youre half drunk now

  youre a- reynolds hesitated

to speak the word

  his lips were curled back in an ugly
snarl and he glared rebelliously into
the steady piercing eyes of the man-
ager silently they faced each other-
reynolds the tiger kineally the lion
both were equally tall though the man-
ager was stockier than his black-eyed
dark-complexioned pitcher kineally
removed his panama and combed his
fingers through his reddish-brown
hair

  your face is as flushed as if you
had a fever he said your eyes
are bloodshot and late hours have
smooched half-moons of charcoal under
them sos any one could tell that you

are traveling straight plumb to the
dogs

  reynolds muttered inarticulately

  yes thats where youre bound
continued the manager im not old
enough to be your father but ive been
kicking around in this world for some
fifteen or sixteen years longer than you
have and ive had plenty of chance to
learn that a pitcher or any other ball
player cant work as battery mate with
old demon booze and last long in the
diamond game

  you were the best pitcher on my
staff last year and you twirled your
team into a championship but now
youre a-hitting the toboggan just as
fast as any one can when you are so-
ber and in good physical condition there
isnt a better man ever toed the slab
than you are and thats why i havent
traded you during the past month i
hoped youd wake up and cut out the
booze and the gang of high-living sports
you are traveling with but if you dont
get your eyes open and quit drinking
before we start on the western trip
ill try to make a deal with some other
club and trade you before the other
managers get wise to the fact that you
are drinking yourself out of the game

  reynolds mumbled something

  what kineally asked

  i guess some o those other man-
agersd be glad to get me reynolds
repeated

  yes until they found that you were
a souse kineally added and then
theyd shunt you back to the minors in
double-quick youd probably last a
year or two in the bushes and then
some little one-horse minor-league out-
fit would give you your unconditional
release and youd be a has-been while
you were yet a kid some future eh

  reynolds slouched against the bu-
reau his hands deep in his pockets a
sullen defiant expression distorted his
features
the shock



  kineally wiped a handkerchief across
his forehead

  ill be hanged if i know why ive
stood for your drinking and violation
of training rules as long as i have he
exclaimed i reckon its because i
remember what a likable clean young
duffer you were when i first bought
you from that little bush league up-
country

  as he paused the manager happened
to glance past the ball player at a pic-
ture standing on the bureau it was
the photograph of a girl in her early
twenties and the face-the expression
of the eyes-the mouth and chin-por-
trayed that rare combination of beauty
of character as well as of feature

  the manager pointed toward the pic-
ture

  to ask a personal question rube
he began is she your sister 

  following the direction of kineallys
extended finger reynolds shook his
head

  kineallys eyes gleamed his satisfac-
tion another avenue of appeal was
open

  then she must be your sweetheart
for i know that youre not married
he stated  and he added earnestly i
suppose you hope to be married some
day 

  reynolds failed to reply his liquor-
inflamed brain was busy mobilizing the
little devils of rage and rebellion what
right had kineally to catechize him he
angrily pondered who gave the man-
ager a license to butt into his private
life 

  why dont you quit the booze and
go straight for her sake if not your
own the manager inquired after an
interval you can hardly expect a
decent girl like the original of that pic-
ture must be to marry a drunken sot
such as continuing your present pace
will make you

  drunken sot no decent girl would
marry him even through his liquor-
a

soaked brain reynolds realized that
the words rang true but their very
truth was like the red rag fluttered
before the bull

  youre a liar he rasped and he
sprang toward the manager one fist
lunging forward as he leaped though
heavily built kineally was quick on his
feet swiftly he side-stepped and par-
ried the blow reynolds whirled about
and rushed a second time again and
again his fists struck out and kineally
took blow after blow on his hands and
arms turning them all aside obsessed
by his whisky-stimulated wrath reyn-
olds forgot all his knowledge of box-
ing his one thought was to beat down
the big man before him who so steadily
blocked the punches and kept forcing
him backward without striking a blow

  back step by step they went until
reynolds stumbled instantly the man-
ager closed in grasping the pitchers
wrists and endeavoring to force him
down into a chair back and forth
they struggled reeling about the room
until with a crash they brought up
against the bureau with a sudden
twist reynolds wrenched one hand free
from the managers viselike grip the
pitcher reached behind him and groped
over the bureau top and an instant
afterward something flashed through
the air thudding dully against the man-
agers head

  reynolds heard a gasp and the fin-
gers about his wrist relaxed the man-
agers knees buckled forward and he
crumpled backward on the rug-a mo-
tionless heap

  breathing heavily reynolds stood
above the inert form a heavy brass
ash tray still grasped in his fist parti-
cles of blood dotted its edge for a
moment brute satisfaction was reflected
from his face then his expression
changed to that of alarm why did
kineally lie so still why was the
fallen mans face so pale dropping
to his knees reynolds pressed a hand


wide-awake magazine

against the managers shirt front the
pitchers hand was trembling and his
own heart pounding furiously as he
fumbled anxiously about on the man-
agers breast he could feel no action
and a crimson stain like red ink on a
sheet of blotting paper was spreading
with ragged circumference upon the
managers hair

  the pitcher grasped the managers
shoulders and shook the deathlike form

  kineally kineally owen kin-
eally he cried

  he jumped to his feet and seized the
water pitcher pouring all of the stale
fluid it contained over the managers
face but the eyes remained closed
the form still

  slowly reynolds backed away from
the prostrate man

  heavens he whispered he-
hes dead  im a murderer

  and with the words came another
thought he had killed kineally they
would arrest him into his vision
flashed the picture of a chair with
straps on its arms legs and back and
a few solemn spectators gathered about
no they mustnt catch him he must
get away

  moving hurriedly about and ever
averting his gaze from the form on the
floor he donned a few garments for
street wear ready to leave he spied
the picture upon the bureau he
snatched it up and turned it over
penned  its back in a feminine hand
was from dora to bob

  hastily tucking it into his inside
pocket he opened the door and stepped
into the hall his nerveless fingers
swung the door shut and he trod
softly down the stairs

  when the evening train coughed into
farmhill station reynolds clad in a
dark suit and with his cloth hat pulled
far down over his eyes swung off on
the side farthest from the station and
making a detour to avoid the well-

lighted section of the town he struck
out into the country

  once during his flight while chang-
ing trains at a junction he had heard
one diminutive newsboy mention the
name reynolds to another grimy-
faced little urchin and rube had stolen
a sidelong glance at the bunch of papers
folded beneath the boys arm the
paper being folded in the middle pre-
vented him from reading the whole of
the big black headline but on the side
of the sheet near to him he spelled out
m-u-r-d-

  as he tramped along in the soft dust
of the country road with the frogs and
insects peeping and shrilling strange
noises out of the dusk of the night his
thoughts rose in rebellion it wasnt
murder murder was something fear-
ful-something repulsive and he hadnt
intended to-to kill kineally he had
struck in self-defense he strove to
convince himself that such had been the
case but every frog-every insect kept
shrilling murder-murder-it was
murder

  not until he reached the whately
farm did he realize that it would be
impossible for him to see dora that
night the chimes of a church in a
distant town were sounding the curfew
hour when he paused by the stone wall
encircling that part of the whately
farm why he had returned to farm-
hill he did not know something had
seemed to draw him to that little town
in the valley and he wanted to see
dora just once more before disappear-
ing to some far corner of the world
where no one would know him where
no one could find him

  for a moment he thought of boldly
entering the house but he quickly dis-
missed the idea they must have read
the papers and knew of his crime noel
whately and his wife had always liked
young bob reynolds and dora-he
knew that doras regard was more than
friendship for him but he hesitated to
the shock



thrust himself branded as a criminal
into that family circle

  he easily vaulted the stone wall and
moved around the house to the barn
as he picked his way across the barn-
yard another thought came to him
what folly his return to farmhill was
it would only make more painful the
breaking of the ties

  i mustnt see her he whispered to
himself

  but no train left the town until early
morning so he resolved to stay in the
barn until nearly daylight and then
return to the station

  as he neared the barn a prolonged
sniff caused him to start and crouch
near to the ground then he remem-
bered it was wolf the dog-the com-
panion who had accompanied dora and
him on their tramps across the fields
and on their fishing trips to the lake

  wolf he called softly

  the big collie came bounding through
the darkness

  still wolf  be still boy he com-
manded

  to his relief the dog recognized him
and refrained from barking two paws
pressed against his knee and the ani-
mal whined joyously

  go back wolf he ordered as he
patted and fondled the collie

  reluctantly the dog turned toward
his kennel and reynolds slid open the
door of the barn a restless horse
tramped in his stall and a frightened
rat scuttled across the floor as he felt
about in the darkness and found the
ladder leading upward nimbly he as-
cended to the loft and creeping far
over to the wall he stretched himself
upon the odorous hay

  he closed his eyes but sleep would
not come he faintly heard the clock
in the farmhouse striking the hour
after an age of sleeplessness it tinkled
again the smell of the sun-dried grass
brought remembrances of his boyhood
and he thought of the plans he and

dora had made for the future then
he remembered the good fellows of
the city with their invitations to have
another and their shallow praise he
groaned in despair he had severed
himself from all of the real joys of
life and now he was but a hunted thing
-to prowl forever from place to place
in his efforts to escape the relentless
hand of the law

  as he lay there an almost uncon-
trollable desire to scratch a match that
he might relieve the awful blackness
possessed him

  i cant he reflected it might set
fire to the place

  suddenly he sat up gasping with a
whistling intaking of breath what had
he heard again they came the faint
strains of music were permeating the
loft as if some stringed instrument was
being played close by he dug his fin-
gers into his ears hoping that the
sounds might be the product of his
imagination but no as he removed
his fingers they continued a strange
weird tune unlike anything he had ever
heard before

  again he jammed his fingers into his
ears to shut out the sounds had his
crime driven him mad  was he
haunted he wondered fearfully with
unsteady trembling legs he made his
way to the ladder and lowered himself
downward he crouched in an unoc-
cupied stall and waited a rat squeaked
beside him but he failed to move
he was listening for that fearsome
music and whenever he closed his eyes
the white face of kineally would spring
before his vision

  of what avail was his freedom if this
continued he thought ideas of giving
himself up entered his mind but he
remembered the high-backed chair with
its straps and its horrible death-dealing
wires what a death no he
couldnt surrender himself but still
if he was to be forever haunted why
maybe it would be better maybe it-

  with a start reynolds awoke-not
from sound sleep but from one of the
fitful dozes into which he had lapsed
just before the gray light of morning
began to lighten the barn with an
ejaculation of self-rebuke he sprang
up and stood blinking in the shaft of
sunlight which blazed through a cob-
webby dusty window he who had
intended to depart before sunrise had
overslept he could hear persons mov-
ing about in the farmhouse as well as
the occasional rattling of crockery and
the sputter of grease in a frying pan

  then footsteps sounded outside of
the barn and before he could turn-
could dart to cover-the door slid back
and a girl stood before him her face
crowned by a wavy mass of fine-spun
fair hair was the flesh-and-blood like-
ness of that portrayed by the picture
he carried in his pocket she wore
neither hat nor bonnet and a dotted
bungalow apron covered her from
shoulders to ankles she stared in
amazement her brows puckering as she
noted the rumpled condition of his
clothing-his drawn features and his
bloodshot eyes

  why bob she exclaimed per-
plexedly what-why-how-

  as she paused he moved forward a
step his nails biting into the palms of
his clenched fists oh how he longed
to take her in his arms and tell her the
whole miserable story little beads of
moisture surged into his eyes and in a
moment she was close to him resting
her hands on his shoulders

  tell me bob she said anxiously
tell me what is the matter why
didnt jou come to the house why
are your clothes all mussed up
choking back his emotions he hesi-
tatingly placed his hands on her arms

  d-dont you know he inquired
brokenly

  know what she demanded

  i-i- he hesitated to say the

words heavens dora you must have

read last nights paper dont you know
that im a-a murderer oh dora
im a murderer

  her fingers clinched convulsively
through his coat and pinched into his
shoulders

  ive killed a man-the man who was
giving me a chance he groaned all
because of the cursed drink and
with his head bowed on her shoulder
he poured forth the story of his fight
with kineally-of his trip to farmhill
-and of his night in the barn then
his arms relaxed and he gently tried to
push her away

  dont touch me girl he told her
im a murderer-not fit to touch
her arms slipped about his neck and
she held him closer

  i wont leave you-i wont she
cried oh bob dont you know that
i love you well go somewhere
together

  no he protested why dora
im haunted i lay up there in the loft
last night and heard music-that dread-
ful unearthly music and kin-his face
kept coming before me out of the dark-
ness no im going to give myself
up and have it over with

  with the passion and entreaty of one
who loved she argued but he steadily
persisted in his resolve he gently drew
her arms from about his neck she
made one final appeal

  wait bob she pleaded let me
go into the house and get last nights
paper im sure that there wasnt any
-any murder headline on it and she
darted from the stable

  her mother busy in the kitchen
glanced up in surprise at the flushed
cheeks and excited eyes of the girl

  what in the world- she began

but dora interrupted

  where is last nights paper
mother she asked

  on the sitting-room table i think
mrs whately replied

  dora hurried from the room the
the shock



paper was not on the sitting-room table
and she searched frantically about the
room finally she found it half hid-
den under a pillow on the lounge where
her father had left it the evening before
spreading out the first page she read

murdock testifies

iron king goes before congressional
committee

  nowhere on the page was reynolds
name mentioned she hurriedly rustled
over page after page until at last on
one of the sporting pages she discov-
ered a small paragraph commenting on
his poor pitching of the day previous
paper in hand she sped back to the
barn reynolds was not in sight

  bob she called softly but received
no answer

  into the loft she climbed but he was
not there as she stood on the hay
she became aware of a peculiar sound
music that was what it resembled
and across her mind flashed the words
of bob for some seconds she listened
in bewilderment and then the little
wrinkles of perplexity cleared from her
forehead she climbed higher upon the
hay until she reached a tiny window
far up near the roof over its opening
were stretched several taut elastics-
the work of her little brother with
each gust of breeze they vibrated and
twanged making sounds not unlike the
music of a harp or a zither

  descending from the loft she hur-
ried out of the bam the man whom
she loved must have taken advantage
of her absence to hasten away she rea-
soned that he might carry out his re-
solve to surrender himself to the au-
thorities so down the dusty road she
hurried determined to overtake him ere
he should reach the town

  a great gray touring car hummed its
way along the country road a continu-
ous cloud of dust like rising smoke

trailing in its wake a big burly man
with tanned features and whose eyes
were obscured by masking goggles
gripped the wheel while beside him sat
another man not so big but with a
bristling black mustache and keen
piercing eyes

  remember mac the big man was
saying if we find him i dont want
the newspaper men or anybody else to
ever hear a word of this i called on
you for help because you are a friend
of mine as well as a police inspector
trained in the ways of tracing men

  dont you worry owen the other
replied never a word will get out
nine times out of ten a young fellow
who has committed a crime or thinks
he has will risk a trip to his home or
old surroundings if we dont find the
boy somewhere about farmhill well
change our tactics he must have
landed quite a crack on your skull he
added

  he surely did the big man agreed
i was unconscious for a half hour or
more and i guess your idea that he
imagined hed finished me and was thus
frightened into running away is right

  the man with th wiry mustache
nodded and tightly gripped the side of
the car as they jounced over a par-
ticularly high bump in the road

  but if the experience proves to be
the shock necessary to break the boy
away from the drink and that gang he
was traveling with continued the big
man why ill be mighty thankful that
he struck the blow hes not only a
wonderful pitcher but i like him he
-look mac look so help me john
rogers look ahead there

  appearing around a bend in the road-
way from behind the trees of the road-
side a solitary figure was tramping
toward them

  stopping the engine and jamming his
foot against the brake pedal the big
man jerked the car to an abrupt stop


wide-awake magazine

beside the young fellow who had
turned out and halted by the edge of
the road waiting for the automobile to

pass

  rube the big man cried pushing
his goggles up on his forehead and
springing from the car

  the man by the roadside stood as if
paralyzed he stared wildly at the big
man who had leaped from the automo-
bile

  k-kineally  came from between
his lips in a throaty whisper kineally 
owen kineally

  he slowly-fearfully extended a
hand as if to touch the big manager-
to make sure that he was a reality and
not the fantasy of a haunted mind

  the big man quickly reached forth
and firmly grasped the hand

  its me all right rube he assured
with the flicker of a smile it takes a
mighty hard wallop to put a tough old
geezer like me down for good

  drawing free his hand the young fel-
low dropped upon one knee in the
dusty sun-scorched grass of the road-
side and burying his face in his arm
he gave vent to his pent-up emotions
his body shaking with convulsive boy-

ish sobs of relief the bareheaded girl
who had appeared around the bend of
the road and was hurrying toward
them was unnoticed by kineally and
the inspector

  i-im glad  im glad the kneel-
ing man choked out im going to
stay here away from the drink and so
help me heaven ill never touch an-
other drop

  the big man rested a hand on the
young fellows shoulder

  no i dont think you will drink any
more boy he said but he con-
tinued you are coming back with me
and ill make you the greatest pitcher
in the game and you and the girl can
marry and be happy

  before the young fellow could reply
the girl was beside them her eyes aglow
and her bosom rising and falling rap-
idly as she breathed many a picture
of owen kineally had smiled at her
from among the pages of newspapers
and she recognized the big man stand-
ing over reynolds unmindful of the
others she dropped to her knees beside
the man she loved and with her arms
about his neck she murmured oh
but im happy bob im so happy

streams that flow through it

to begin with there is a farm creek so that farmers creek has a
place then there is a chicken creek a duck creek a goose creek and a
number of turkey creeks as well as pigeon creek there are fox hawk and
rat creeks to make way with the domestic animals and some crow creeks
while there is also a fly creek and mosquito creek to worry the summer
boarders milk and cold water creeks are present likewise a hog run and a
mud creek so that bacon creek is not strange

    it seems natural that with a bee creek and a bee branch there should also
be a honey creek there are a couple of cherry creeks a crabapple creek and
plenty of plum creeks and for wild animals there are bear beaver buck
crane deer doe elk otter panther raccoon skunk and wolf creeks

    with a keg creek there is a whisky creek and a whisky run finally
there is purgatory creek

he old sailor capn dan
sat on the edge of the
deck house of the sloop
agnes t watching the
fleet coining in from the
days work at dragrak-
ing the handrakers
were already in the con-
tents of their baskets emptied into his
and piled up neatly in the hold their
scores tallied up in the little leather-cov-
ered notebook that was capn dans
daybook ledger journal and every-
thing else known to the practice of ac-
counts

  the handrakers had all brought in
a good days catch if the dragrakers
did as well the agnes t would have a
heavy load to carry to the city and the
money to meet the note which would
soon be due would be ready when the
time came to pay it

  capn dan cast an eye aloft at the
empty bushel basket which had been
hoisted at the masthead to let every one
know the agnes t was ready to buy
clams then he looked out toward the
mouth of the harbor where the first
of the fleet of dragrakers was coming
in around the point in that instant
the expression of his face altered and
his troubled glance changed to one of
pride and pleasure

  the cut of the head of the mainsail
told him that as usual it was the vic-
torine that was leading the fleet out-
pointing and outfooting the ranger
nautilus and the dashazvay to say
nothing of the other sloops less famed
for their speed parental pride shone
clear in his gray eyes for was not the
victorine his own boat and was not his
only son young dan sailing her

  young dan at twenty-one had al-
ready won the reputation of being the
smartest boatman in lockport the
way he would carry on sail was in the
words of the clammers a caution
he was the light of his fathers eye
and capn dan had begun to lean rather
heavily on his son

  he was looking forward to the time
when dans already keen business abil-
ity would be sufficiently recognized to
have the dealers up in the market place
the same reliance on his word as they
had for so many years placed on the
fathers then he could step aside and
take a rest that rest so many men look
forward to before the great rest comes

  when young dan caught sight of his
father he arose from his seat on the
wheel box and swung his arm in saluta-
tjon then he gave the wheel a couple
of turns shot the victorine up in the
wind and laid her alongside the agnes

t as if the sloop were a fast horse
that a skillful driver had stopped at a
carriage block

  what luck dannie called his
father i see yon wasnt the last one
in

  had a bully day dad struck a
fresh bed off west p int and got a jim-
dandy load goin to send any to mar-
ket to-night then casting back to
his fathers allusion to his beating the
other boats he added dryly oh yes
theres some go in the old victorine yet
them fellers make me tired with their
talk about beatin her

  just as soon as we cn git the agnes
t loaded dan i want you to start for
the market dolan telegraphed me to-
day they wanted all i could send em
and as soon as i could get em off

  as the boy had stepped aboard the
sloop by this time the captain added in
a whisper you know that voorhees
note falls due day after to-morrow and
i need the money to meet it

  dan nodded his head and some of
the gravity that had settled down again
on his fathers face was reflected on his
own then he started in on the heavy
task of transferring his days catch
from the deck of the victorine to the
hold of the market boat

  while he and the three men who
made up the working crew were hard
at this the remaining boats of the fleet
were coming up one by one and rang-
ing themselves on either side of the
market boat with jibs hauled down
and mainsails slatting in the breeze
they all lay head to the wind while
their crews passed basket after basket
down into the hold of the agnes t to
the accompaniment of loud interchanges
of talk and chaff

  before the sun had vanished in the
west the loading was accomplished the
sloops had pushed off one by one and
worked away to their anchorages for
the night and young dan and jim
humphreys who comprised his crew

had hoisted the mainsail on the ag-
nes t

  his father hauled his skiff alongside
as young dan and humphreys went
forward to get in the anchor and as
the pawls clinked against the ratchets
with that sound which is so musical to
a seamans ears capn dan picked up
the oars and started to pull toward the
shore

  be careful dannie he called across
the water it was the usual warning
and farewell dont carry that topsl
after dark it begins to look squally off
to windard

  all right father yelled young
dan as the anchor broke from the
ground and he ran aft to the wheel
weve got to get these clams to mar-
ket you know

  he spun the wheel over as hum-
phreys hoisted the jib and the sloop
filled away with her bowsprit pointing
out toward the mouth of the harbor

  by the time the agnes t had cleared
the point young dan found that the
wind had freshened considerably and
was now coming out of the northwest
in such vigorous puffs that carrying the
topsail was out of the question hum-
phreys suggested turning in a reef but
young dan said he guessed that wasnt
necessary just yet he asked jim to
take the wheel while he went below to
put on his coat when he had taken
his place again humphreys dropped
down into the cabin lit the fire and put
the kettle on for tea

  young dan ate his evening meal as
he sat at the wheel and before it was
finished the increasing force of the
wind made steering with one hand and
holding his teacup in the other a rather
difficult business when it was finished
and humphreys had cleared away the
dishes he came up on deck and settled
down in the lee of the deck house with
his coat collar turned up around his
ears

  gee dannie but its blowin he
capn dans son



commented and aint she a-travelin
though do you want me to get out
the lights

  oh never mind em replied young
dan with the sailors too common dis-
regard of the use of side lights we
can light em up when we get around
the fort come and take the wheel will
you jim i want to fix that jib shes
slattin round there and aint half
drawin

  jim uncoiled himself from his cor-
ner in the lee of the house and took
the wheel as young dan went forward
they were off coffins beach by this
time and jim could see the summer
hotels lifting their huge bulks up against
the dark-blue sky studded with stars
that twinkled with unusual brilliancy in
the frosty night air

  as the sloop was running dead be-
fore the wind the mainsail was doing
all the work and the jib was slatting to
and fro and not doing what the young
skipper thought it should that was
how his passion for carrying sail
showed itself and that was the cause of
the tragedy that followed

  picking up the long oar lying along
the rail he took a turn of the sheet
around it at the clew of the jib and
boomed the sail out to port where it
caught the full strength of the wind
as it bellied out causing the sloop to
fairly jump through the water young
dan watched it for a moment and then
called out to his companion

  hows that jim aint she a-pull-
in

  before humphreys could make a re-
ply he heard a crash and the wheel
was jerked out of his hands

  to his horror he saw the mast break
off just under the hounds with the
topmast and all the gear it fell to the
deck striking young dan and bury-
ing him beneath the wreckage

  the shock of the accident stunned
humphreys for a moment then he
jumped forward along the tossing deck

to drag his companions body out from
under the splintered spars sails and
rigging

  the jib was lying in a tangled heap
and the mainsail was hanging broad off
to leeward dipping down into the seas
as the sloop rolled and coming up with
a jerk as if it meant to pluck the cleats
and blocks and traveler clear from their
fastenings

  humphreys caught hold of young
dans feet and gently as he could
pulled him out from beneath the piled-
up gear stricken as he was by the
shock of the catastrophe terror caught
a fresh grip on him as he saw the boys
face

  ashy white he lay with his eyes
closed as if in death across his fore-
head a great cut ran with the blood
slowly and steadily oozing out and
down through his hair already matted
with the thick stream

  humphreys sickened at the sight and
tried to turn his head away for the
moment he was panic-stricken then he
shook himself together and half car-
ried half dragged the body of the boy
down into the cabin and stretched him
gently on the blankets in the berth
then he jumped on deck again

  for the time one idea possessed him
he must get a doctor for dannie he
never thought to let the anchor go
never thought to light a signal lamp
he wanted to get a doctor at once and
he knew there were two or three doc-
tors at the quarantine station over by
the fort

  humphreys had lost his head in the
desire to carry out this plan of action
pie tumbled the skiff overboard shipped
the oars and hatless and without tak-
ing time to pull off his coat he began
to row to the government reservation
where the one tiling needed a doctor
was to be found

  no one knows how long it took him
to pull across the mile of water nor


wide-awake magazine

how long it was before he rushed
breathless up to the doctors door
without even sinking down into the
chair the kindly health officer pushed
over to him he stammered out the story
of tlie tragedy that had been enacted
out in the bay on the deck of the
agnes t

  before jim had finished his tale the
health officer called to one of his as-
sistants to ring up the boat and let the
captain know they were going out
then he busied himself putting some in-
struments into a black bag and before
jim had completely recovered his wind
he was in danger of losing it again as
he followed the doctor and his assistant
down the path to the landing where the
little white tug with its tall yellow
stack was moored

  as they went along the health officer
asked humphreys for the address of
the injured boys father

  well send him a telegram he said
then hell probably come out to look
for the sloop too you say she had no
lights burning hum that makes it
so much harder to find her

  they stopped at the office of the press
association down at the pier and the
operator sent the message to lockport
following it with a brief story of the
accident to the main office up in the
city then they stepped aboard the tug
the lines were cast off and the search
for the agnes t began

  what that night was to humphreys
and to capn dan who on receipt of
the telegram had hired the only tug in
lockport and started out to find his
son only they could tell calculating
on the direction of the wind and the
set of the tides the two tugs cruised
about until the day began to break along
the eastern horizon

  working gradually to the eastward
backward and forward on long
stretches the tugs gradually as if by
a common instinct drew together by

the time the dawn had broken and
humphrey could make out the other
tug he told the health officer she was
from lockport and that probably capn
dan was aboard her

  he stepped outside the pilot house
with a pair of binoculars in his hand
and as he did so he noticed a man do
the same thing on the other boat

  putting the glasses to his eyes a
glance told him that it was young dans
father humphreys swung his arm
over his head and then saw the captain
turn and speak to the man in the pilot
house a moment later just as the tug
headed for the health officers boat the
captain of the latter who had been
scanning the horizon gave a start and
cried out there she is pointing
off to the eastward he twirled the
spokes over gave a pull on the jingle
bell and whistled down the tube to the
engineer to give her all the steam she
could carry

  the eyes of every one on the two
boats turned in the direction in which
the quarantine tug was headed and
then the sound of the jingle bell on the
lockport boat came across the water

  head and head they raced to the
eastward smoke pouring from their
funnels and a broad wave of foaming
water piled up before their bows the
light was now strong enough for them
to make out the agnes taground on
the long sandy beach at the eastern end
of the harbor

  as she lay with her bow buried in
the sand and listed over by the weight
of the outswung boom and the wreck
of the topmast the sloop made a tragic
picture in itself the cold gray light
of the dawn fell down and around the
agnes t making her stand out against
the steel-blue water and the pale sand
hills looming large against this back-
ground until her proportions seemed gi-
gantic

  the mainsail hung idly down from
capn dans son



the gaff that had been held just below
the break in the mast by the jamming of
the hoops the main sheet trailed over-
board in long tangled loops the shrouds
and halyards drooped in picturesque
confusion jib and mainsail were gray
with the night dew and the reflected
light

  the little waves rolled up and broke
along her sides and spent their tiny
force upon the beach so they were
doing yesterday when young dan was
living so they were doing to-day when
the boy was lying stretched out in the
berth a ghastly solitary tenant

  as the two tugs came nearer and
nearer to her the lockport boat gradu-
ally drew ahead of the health officers
tug they could see capn dan go aft
with one of his best men and stand by
the painter of the skiff that was towing
astern humphrey noticed a couple of
men standing on the beach near the
wrecked sloop and through the glasses
he made them out to be patrols from the
life-saving station

  he could also see a big power boat
coming down from the village that lay
inside the point still farther to the east-
ward and he wondered if her business
lay with the agnes t the leading tug
slowed down as she reached a point in
the channel off the wreck capn dan
and the man near him dropped over
into the skiff and pulled like madmen
for the sloop

  just as they came alongside of her
the power boat swung up by the wreck
and a man standing up in the bow
called to the captain

  keep off that boat theres a dead
man aboard of her and im the coro-
ner i warn you- his words

trailed off into silence as he caught sight
of capn dans face

  even the crass spirit of a jack-in-
office could not resist the mute protest
he saw in every line of it stern rigid
a very mask of immobility given a dig-

nity that made it noble by its grief and
suffering the fathers face awed every-
thing into silence

  moving as in a trance capn dan
climbed over the rail of the sloop and
stepped down into the cabin

  as he disappeared from sight the
spell of silence laid on the coroner was
broken and he began to mutter protests
against violations of the law and de-
claring hed stop this thing right now
before it went any further

  presently capn dan emerged from
the cabin carrying the limp body of
his son in his arms as he stepped into
the cockpit the coroners voice was
hushed

  the father straightened himself up
with a dignity that made the movement
noble and faced the official with eyes
that looked across the boys body

  between the time he had gone down
into the cabin and came out of it
twenty years seemed to have been added
to his age in his grief he looked like
some old chieftain who had given up
the life of his favorite son in his coun-
trys cause and was now bearing the
body home to his castle to mourn over
it	v

  a little shadow of deeper pain passed
across his face as he looked at the in-
truder on his woe and then he said
simply

  he is my son

  at the sound of his voice and the
look in his face the coroner recoiled
from the captain as if he had been
struck the man in the skiff uncov-
ered his head he thought young dan
was dead

  the captain still holding the boy in
his arms stepped down into the skiff
and held him close to his breast as the
man at the oars pulled slowly toward
the tug by this time the health offi-
cers boat had come up to the skiff and
the doctor leaning over the rail said
quietly let me see him captain


wide-awake magazine

  capn dan looked up at the doctor

  hes dead he said almost in a
whisper

  wont you let us see him there
may be a chance the doctor pleaded

  then capn dan held his son out to
the two doctors who laid him down on
a blanket on the deck

  there was a moment of silence as the
two worked over the body then with
an exclamation of satisfaction one of
the doctors sprang to his feet

  i thought so he cried i thought
he was still breathing hes badly hurt
but the poor lad is not dead

  capn dan stood as if turned to stone
a great tear rolled down his face but
he said nothing he watched with in-

describable pathos as the surgeons
brought their skill into play and finally
when young dan began to babble an
incoherent string of words he drew one
weather-beaten hand across his eyes as
if in a daze

  a while later young dan sighed and
looked into his fathers face

  was i in time dad he whispered
softly

  capn dan smiled down at him and
lied so bravely that the recording angel
must have stopped to mend his pen just
then and forgot to mark it down
against him

  plenty dannie plenty he replied

  and then he leaned still farther down
and kissed him

you want me to be a crook

grant sewards jaw squared as he shot this from between his set
teeth and there was a dangerous flash in his dark eyes

    i wouldnt put it that way grant

    there isnt any other way you dont call it straight-do you

    this was what grant seward replied to his unscrupulous employer when
the scoundrel wanted him to cheat the customers by filling up the five-gallon
beaver spring water bottles with ordinary river water there were other frauds
suggested by the rascally storekeeper too which grant spurned

    the upshot of it is that grant seward finds himself in the business of cut-
ting ice on the st lawrence river among the thousand islands with the ther-
mometer near the bottom of the tube and winds that threaten to saw his ears
off even through his thick cap

    besides battling with the ice and an arctic temperature rather than be a
party to the grocerymans mean trickery grant has to fight several human
enemies who have a habit of hitting below the belt you will read all this
and much more in the new novelette

a battle below zero

by weldon w broderick

to be published in the next issue the story is full of thrilling adventures with
some novel and narrow escapes for this thoroughly american hero he strikes
all his own blows fairly and squarely giving the other fellow always a fair
show-often when he hardly deserves it i can promise the novelette to be
one of the breeziest most convincing and absorbing that has ever come from
this authors facile pen

    there have been many calls from readers for more stories from cornelius
shea in a recent issue you were promised that this call would be answered
it has been for shea has just completed a serial which he has entitled

the lost placer

and it carries an appeal to every reader of fiction who has a drop of red blood
in his veins the first chapters of this serial begin in the next issue and depict
g

wide-awake magazine

western life in a manner that has made shea famous as a writer of stories
dealing with stirring doings on the borderland

    in the opinion of many leslie w quirk is the best writer of sport stories
in this country certainly it is true that he is an authority on all sports and
you feel when you read his description of a contest of any kind that the author
knows what he is writing about that he has been right down there himself
and has not just sat up in the grand stand or read about it the next day in
the morning paper not only does quirk know ail sports but he knows how to
tell about them in a most interesting manner his plot is always a good one
and he draws his characters so well that they stick

the yellow morning-glory

which you will find in the next issue is in my humble opinion the best run-
ning story that quirk has ever written it is quite a long story but take my
word for it you will wish that he had made it twice as long

    there is a particularly well-assorted and well-written collection of short
stovies in the next issue let me hear what you think of my selection and which
of the stories you like best and what is of more importance why

          j  j

for the editor i have read tip-	it is a fine publication i have been tak-

the opening chapters of a serial by

cornelius shea

entitled

the lost placer

    for years cornelius shea has been one of the
most popular authors of stories of adventure in
the west mr shea wrote a serial for you
the kid from bar b which we published
during the early summer months at that
time you were asked if you wanted more stories
by mr shea we received a flood of replies in
answer to this question and all of the letters spoke
most highly of mr sheas work and requested
more of it

   mr shea says that the lost placer
is a far better story than the kid from bar b
we agree with him what do you say
