 but i changed almost overnight

 as i passed the presidents office i could
 not help hearing my name instinct-
 ively i paused to listen that human
 clam he was saying cant represent us
 hes a hard worker but he seems to have no
 ability to express himself i had hoped to
 make him a branch mana-
 ger this fall but he seems
 to withdraw farther and
 farther into his shell all
 the time ive given up
 hopes of making anything
 out of him

   so that was itl that
 was the reason why i had
 been passed over time and
 again when promotions
 were being made that
 was why i was just a
 plodder-a truck horse
 for our firm capable of
 doing a lot of heavy work
 but of no use where bril-
 liant performance was re-
 quired i was a failure
 unless i could do what
 seemed impossible-learn
 to use words forcefully
 effectively and convinc-
 ingly

in  minutes a day

   and then suddenly i discovered a new easy
 method which made me a powerful speaker
 almost overnight i learned how to bend
 others to my will how to dominate one man
 or an audience of thousands soon i had
 won salary increases promotion popularity
 power today i always have a ready flow
 of speech at my command i am able to rise

 to any occasion to meet any emergency with
 just the right words and i accomplished all
 this by developing the natural power of
 speech possessed by everyone but cultivated
 by so few-by simply spending  minutes a
 day in the privacy of my own home on this

  prize story contest

by hugo gernsback

 since the first appearance of amazing stories
 we have received a great many manuscripts for pub-
 lication in our magazine we wish to state at this
 point that at present the magazine is not in the market
 for full length novels because the editors have a great many
 on hand that await publication they do however want
 short stories under  words stories that would occupy
 nine or ten pages in amazing stories

   furthermore we receive an increasing number of letters
 asking if we are in the market for short stories and to these
 we wish to reply in the affirmative we can not get too
 many real short scientifiction stories to encourage this we
 arc starting a rather unique
 contest this month

   we have composed on our 
 front cover a picture which ll
 illustrates a story to be writ- 
 ten by our readers we are 

 in prizes i

                                the following cash prizes will be awarded 
 frank to say that we havent j ancj wju be paid for on publication of the prize- ii
 the slightest idea what the  winnin stories jn amazing stories ii

 picture is supposed to show

 the editors ideas pertain-
 ing to the real solution-
 if one there be - based up-
 on the picture are neces-
 sarily vague

   there is for instance the
 strange racc of people which
 you see in the left fore-
 ground while in the distance

 there is an equally strange city which may or may not ik- on
 this planet and there is the still stranger ball-like machine
 floating in space which apparently has captured a modern
 ocean greyhound in some amazing manner what is going
 to happen to the ocean liner is the great secret docs the
 ocean liner contain human beings or have they been left
 behind what force has lifted the steamship into space in
 this incredible way and where is it being transported all
 these are vital questions that all of us should like to have
 answered

   now some one of our readers is going to write a real
 short story of less than  words around this picture
 he is going to study the picture from all perspectives and
 knowing a bit about science he will not have much trouble
 writing a most convincing story we know it will be so
 convincing that we will actually believe it and the author
 who is going to write the best story will be a good observer
 because he will miss no detail of the picture and will take
 cognizance of even the smallest detail

   it is in the very nature of this contest that there can not

first prize

second prize 

third prize  

      the stories will appear in subsequent is-
 sues in their correct order of merit

  be a great many prize winners the editors have limited
  the prizes to three and only three stories will be chosen and
  only three will be printed the reading of the three prize-
  wiruiing stories will we know be most interesting because
  each will very likely be entirely different in plot and in
  treatment

    here then is a great chance for you to becomc an author
  it is a great opportunity to try your hand in an imaginative
  story of uie scicntifiction type but before you jump to
  any conclusions be sure that you read the rules carefully
  so as not to be disqualified

     the purpose of this contest is to have you write a story

                                   around the illustration
                        ron the front cover of
                        this issue

                                i the story should be be-
                                   tween  and 
                                   words

                            j the story must be of
                              the scientifiction type
                              and must contain cor-
                              rect scientific facts to
                              make it appear plausible
                              and within the realm of
                              present-day knowledge
                              of science

                          the story must be
                           typewritten or in pen and
                           ink no penciled mat-

chapter i
mr bedford meets mr cavor at lympne

s i sit down to write here amidst the
shadows of vine-leaves under the blue
sky of southern italy it comes to me
with a certain quality of astonishment
that my participation in these amaz-
ing adventures of mr cavor was after all
the outcome of the purest accident it might have
been any one i fell into these things at a time
when i thought myself removed from the slightest
possibility of disturbing experiences i had gone to
lympne because i had imagined it the most unevent-
ful place in the world here at any rate said
i i shall find peace and a chance to work

  and this book is the sequel so utterly at vari-
ance is destiny with all the little plans of men

  i may perhaps mention here that very recently i
had come an ugly cropper in certain business enter-
prises sitting now surrounded by all the circum-
stances of wealth there is a luxury in admitting my
extremity i can admit even that to a certain ex-
tent my disasters were conceivably of my own mak-
ing it may be there are directions in which i
have some capacity but the conduct of business
operations is not among
these but in those days
i was young and my
youth among other ob-
jectionable forms took
that of a pride in my
capacity for affairs i
am young still in years
but the things that have
happened to me have rub-
bed something of the
youth from my mind

whether they have
brought any wisdom to
light below it is a more
doubtful matter

  it is scarcely necessary
to go into the details of
the speculations that
landed me at lympne in
kent nowadays even
about business trans-
actions there is a strong
spice of adventure i took

risks in these things 

there is invariably a cer- ibbmbmbhbresbsmmmba
tain amount of give and

take and it fell to me finally to do the giving
reluctantly enough even when i had got out
of everything one cantankerous creditor saw fit
to be malignant perhaps you have met that flam-
ing sense of outraged virtue or perhaps you have
only felt it he ran me hard it seemed to me at
last that there was nothing for it but to write a
play unless i wanted to drudge for my living as a
clerk i have a certain imagination and luxurious
tastes and i meant to make a vigorous fight for
it before that fate overtook me in addition to my
belief in my powers as a business man i had always

   iesides being one of his masterpieces this amazing
 story by h g wells is undoubtedly one of the
 greatest moon talcs of adventure ever written for ages
 speculation has been rife as to what sort of creatures the
 moon could harbor ive of today know that the
 moon has no atmosphere at least not on the surface we
 know the moon to be a dead world having long cooled
 down its volcanic activities stopped long before the first
 living creature crazvled upon this earth

   the moon therefore must be a dead world-so our
 scientists now argue that means that its interior prob-
 ably contains enormous grottoes and caves such as are
 not found in our world it is possible therefore that
 remnants of a long-vanished atmosphere of the moon
 will be found in the interior of that planet making
 it highly probable for some sort of organism to carry on
 an existence there

   what grotesque form such organisms have taken on
 during the ages it is impossible to definitely affirm one
 mans guess is as good as anothers but somehow h g
 wells in this story probably comes as close to the truth
 as any one can and the story is written so convincingly
 that instead of gaining the impression that yau arc read-
 ing fiction you sense rather that you are reading a true
 exploration tale

   we know that you will follow the developments in this
 story with breathless interest

in those days had an idea that i was equal to
writing a very good play it is not i believe a
very uncommon persuasion i knew there is noth-
ing a man can do outside legitimate business trans-
actions that has such opulent possibilities and
very probably that biased my opinion i had in-
deed got into the habit of regarding this unwritten
drama as a convenient little reserve put by for a
rainy day that rainy day had come and i set to
work

  i soon discovered that writing a play was a longer
business than i had supposed at first i had reckon-
ed ten days for it and it was to have a pied-b-terre
while it was in hand that i came to lympne i
reckoned myself lucky in getting that little bunga-
low i got it on a three years agreement i put
in a few sticks of furniture and while the play
was in hand i did my own cooking my cooking
would have shocked mrs bond and yet you
know it had flavour i had a coffee-pot a sauce-
pan for eggs and one for potatoes and a frying
pan for sausages and bacon-such was the simple
apparatus of my comfort one cannot always be
magnificent but simplicity is always a possible
alternative for the rest i laid in an eighteen-
gallon cask of beer on credit and a trustful baker
came each day it was not perhaps in the style
of sybaris but i have had
hfijlhbssfifisfib worse times i was a
little sorry for the baker
who was a very decent
man indeed but even for
him i hoped

  certainly if any one
wants solitude the place
is lympne it is in the
clay part of kent and my
bungalow stood on the
edge of an old sea cliff
and stared across the flats
of romney marsh at the
sea in very wet weather
the place is almost inac-
cessible and i have heard
that at times the postman
used to traverse the more
succulent portions of his
route with boards upon
his feet i never saw him
doing so but i can quite
imagine it outside the
doors of the few cottages
and houses that make up
the present village big
birch besoms are stuck to wipe off the worst of
the clay which will give some idea of the texture
of the district i doubt if the place would be
there at all if it were not a fading memory of
things gone for ever it was the big port of eng-
land in roman times portus lemanus and now the
sea is four miles away all down the steep hill are
boulders and masses of roman brickwork and from
it old watling street still paved in places starts
like an arrow to the north i used to stand on the
hill and think of it all the galleys and legions the
captives and officials the women and traders the


am azin otstories

speculators like myself all the swarm and tumult
that came clanking in and out of the harbour and
now just a few lumps of rubble on a grassy slope
and a sheep or two-and i and where the port
had been were the levels of the marsh sweeping
round in a broad curve to distant dungeness and
dotted here and there with tree clumps and the
church towers of old mediajval towns that are fol-
lowing leman us now towards extinction

  that outlook on the marsh was indeed one
of the finest views i have ever seen i suppose
dungeness was fifteen miles away it lay like a
raft on the sea and farther westward were the
hills by hastings under the setting sun some-
times they hung close and clear sometimes they
were faded and low and often the drift of the
weather took them clean out of sight and all
the nearer parts of the marsh were laced and lit
by ditches and canals

  the window at which i worked looked over the
skyline of this crest and it was from this window
that i first set eyes on cavor it was just as i
was struggling with my scenario holding down
my mind to the sheer hard work of it and natural-
ly enough he arrested my attention

  the sun had set the sky was a vivid tranquillity
of green and yellow and against that he came out
black-the oddest little figure

  he was a short round-bodied thin-legged little
man with a jerky quality in his motions he had
seen fit to clothe his extraordinary mind in a 
cricket cap and overcoat and cycling knickerbock-
ers and stockings why he did so i do not know for
he never cycled and he never played cricket it
was a fortuitous concurrence of garments aris-
ing i know not how he gesticulated with his
hands and arms and jerked his head about and
buzzed he buzzed like something electric you
never heard such buzzing and ever and again he
cleared his throat with a most extraordinary noise

  there had been rain and that spasmodic walk of
his was enhanced by the extreme slipperiness
of the footpath exactly as he came against the
sun he stopped pulled out a watch hesitated then
with a sort of convulsive gesture he turned and
retreated with every manifestation of haste no
longer gesticulating but going with ample strides
that showed the relatively large size of his feet-
they were i remember grotesquely exaggerated in
size by adhesive clay-to the best possible advan-
tage

  this occurred on the first day of my sojourn
when my play-writing energy was at its height
and i regarded the incident simply as an annoying
distraction-the waste of five minutes i return-
ed to my scenario but when next evening the
apparition was repeated with remarkable preci-
sion and again the next evening and indeed every
evening when rain was not falling concentration
upon the scenario became a considerable effort
confound the man said i one would think he
was learning to be a marionette and for several
evenings i cursed him pretty heartily

  then my annoyance gave way to amazement
and curiosity why on earth should a man do
this thing on the fourteenth evening i could

   stand it no longer and so soon as he appeared i
   opened the french window crossed the verandah
   and directed myself to the point where he invari-
   ably stopped

   he had his watch out as i came up to him he
   had a chubby rubicund face with reddish brown
   eyes-previously i had seen him only against the
   light one moment sir said i as he turned

   he stared one moment he said certainly
   or if you wish to speak to me for longer and it
   is not asking too much-your moment is up-would
   it trouble you to accompany me

   not in the least said i placing myself beside
   him

   my habits are regular my time for intercourse
   -limited

   this i presume is your time for exercise

   it is i come here to enjoy the sunset

   you dont you never have been its all
   sir

   you never look at it

   never look at it

   no ive watched you thirteen nights and
    not once have you looked at the sunset-not once
    he knitted his brows like one who encounters a
   problem

   c well i enjoy the sunlight-the amtosphere-
   i go along this path through that gate-he jerk-
   ed his head over his shoulder-and round-

   you donft you never have been- its all
   nonsense there isnt a way to-night for in-
   stance-

   oh to-night let me see ah  just glanced
   at my watch saw that i had already been out just
   three minutes over the precise half-hour decided

   there was not time to go round turned-

   you always do

   he looked at me-reflected perhaps i do now
   i come to think of it but what was it you wanted
   to speak to me about

   why this

   this

  yes why do you do it every night you

  come making a noise-

   making a noise

   like this-i imitated his buzzing noise

   he looked at me and it was evident the buzzing
   awakened distaste do i do that he asked
   every blessed evening

   i had no idea

   he stopped dead he regarded me gravely can
   it be he said that i have formed a habit

   well it looks like it doesnt it

   he pulled down his lower lip between finger and
   thumb he regarded a puddle at his feet

   my mind is much occupied he said and
   you want to know why well sir i can assure
   you that not only do i not know why i do these
   things but i did not even know i did them come
   to think it is just as you say i never have been
   beyond that field    and these things annoy
   you 

   for some reason i was beginning to relent to-
   wards him not annoy i said but-imagine
   yourself writing a play

   i couldnt
the first men in the moon



  well anything that needs concentration

   ah he said of course and meditated his
expression became so eloquent of distress that i
relented still more after all there is a touch of
aggression in demanding of a man you dont know
why he hums on a public footpath

  you see he said weakly its a habit

  oh i recognise that

  i must stop it

  but not if it puts you out after all i had
no business-its something of a liberty

not at all sir he said not at all i am
greatly indebted to you i should guard myself
against these things in future i will could i
trouble you-once again that noise
something like this i said zuzzoo zuzzoo

but really you know-

  i am greatly obliged to you in fact i know
i am getting absurdly absent-minded you are
quite justified sir-perfectly justified indeed i
am indebted to you the thing shall end and
now sir i have already brought you farther than
i should have done

  i do hope my impertinence-

  not at all sir not at all

  we regarded each other for a moment i raised
my hat and wished him a good evening he
responded convulsively and so we went our ways

  at the stile i looked back at his receding figure
his bearing had changed remarkably he seemed
limp shrunken the contrast with his former
gesticulating zuzzooing self took me in some ab-
surd way as pathetic i watched him out of sight
then wishing very heartily i had kept to my own
business i returned to my bungalow and my play

  the next evening i saw nothing of him nor
the next but he was very much in my mind and
it had occurred to me that as a sentimental comic
character he might serve a useful purpose in the
development of my plot the third day he called
upon me

  for a time i was puzzled to think what had
brought him he made indifferent conversation
in the most formal way then abruptly he came to
business he wanted to buy me out of my bunga-
low

  you see he said i dont blame you in the
least but youve destroyed a habit and it dis-
organises my day ive walked past here for years
-years no doubt ive hummed    youve
made all that impossible

  i suggested he might try some other direction
no there is no other direction this is the
only one ive inquired and now-every after-
noon at four-i come to a dead wall

  but my dear sir if the thing is so important

to you-

  its vital you see im-im an investigator
-i am engaged in a scientific research i live-
he paused and seemed to think just over there
he said and pointed suddenly dangerously near
my eye the house with white chimneys you see
just over the trees and my circumstances are ab-
normal-abnormal i am on the point of complet-
ing one of the most important demonstrations-
i can assure you one of the most important demon-

strations that have ever been made it requires
constant thought constant mental ease and activ-
ity and the afternoon was my brightest time-
effervescing with new ideas-new points of view

  but why not come by still

  it would be all different i should be self-
conscious i should think of you at your play-
watching me irritated-instead of thinking of my
work no i must have the bungalow

  i meditated naturally i wanted to think the
matter over thoroughly before anything decisive
was said i was generally ready enough for busi-
ness in those days and selling always attracted
me but in the first place it was not my bungalow
and even if i sold it to him at a good price i
might get inconvenienced in the delivery of goods
if the current owner got wind of the transaction
and in the second i was well-undischarged it
was clearly a business that required delicate hand-
ling moreover the possibility of his being in
pursuit of some valuable invention also interested
me it occurred to me that i would like to know
more of this research not with any dishonest in-
tention but simply with an idea that to know what
it was would be a relief from play-writing i
threw out feelers

  he was quite willing to supply information
indeed once he was fairly under way the conver-
sation became a monologue he talked like a man
long pent up who has had it over with himself
again and again he talked for nearly an hour
and i must confess i found it a pretty stiff bit of
listening but through it all there was the under-
tone of satisfaction one feels when one is neglect-
ing work one has set oneself during that first
interview i gathered very little of the drift of his
talk half his words were technicalities entirely
strange to me and he illustrated one or two points
with what he was pleased to call elementary mathe-
matics computing on an envelope with a copying-
ink pencil in a manner that made it hard even to
seem to understand yes i said yea go on
nevertheless i made out enough to convince me
that he was no mere crank playing at discoveries
in spite of his crank-like appearance there was a
force about him that made that impossible wfcat-
ever it was it was a thing with mechanical possi-
bilities he told me of a work-shed he had and
of three assistants-originally jobbing carpenters
-whom he had trained now from the work-shed
to the patent office is clearly only one step he
invited me to see those things i accepted readily
and took care by a remark or so to underline that
the proposed transfer of the bungalow remained
very conveniently in suspense

  at last he rose to depart with an apology for
the length of his call talking over his work was
he said a pleasure enjoyed only too rarely it
was not often he found such an intelligent listener
as myself he mingled very little with professional
scientific men

  so much pettiness he explained so much
intrigue and really when one has an idea-a
novel fertilising idea- i dont want to be un-
charitable but-

  i am a man who believes in impulses i made


amazing stories

what was perhaps a rash proposition but you
must remember that i had been alone play-writing
in lympne for fourteen days and my compunction
for his ruined walk still hung about me why
not said i make this your new habit in the
place of the one i spoilt at least until we can
settle about the bungalow what you want is to
turn over your work in your mind that you have
always done during your afternoon walk un-
fortunately thats over-you cant get things back
as they were but why not come and talk about
your work to me use me as a sort of wall against
which you may throw your thoughts and catch them
again its certain i dont know enough to steal
your ideas myself-and i know no scientific
men-

  i stopped he was considering evidently the
thing attracted him but im afraid i should
bore you he said

  you think im too dull

  oh no but technicalities-

  anyhow youve interested me immensely this
afternoon

  of course it would be a great help to me noth-
ing clears up ones ideas so much as explaining them
hitherto--

  my dear sir say no more

  but really can you spare the time

  there is no rest like change of occupation i
said with profound conviction

  the affair was over on my verandah steps he
turned i am already greatly indebted to you
he said

  i made an interrogative noise

  you have completely cured me of that ridicu-
lous habit of humming he explained

  i think i said i was glad to be of any service to
him and he turned away

  immediately the train of thought that our con-
versation had suggested must have resumed its
sway his arms began to wave in their former
fashion the faint echo of zuzzoo came back to
me on the breeze   

  well after all that was not my affair   

  he came the next day and again the next
day after that and delivered two lectures on physics
to our mutual satisfaction he talked with an air
of being extremely lucid about the ether and
tubes of force and gravitational potential
and things like that and i sat in my other folding-
chair and said yes go on i follow you to
keep him going it was tremendously difficult stuff
but i do not think he ever suspected how much i
did not understand him there were moments
when i doubted whether i was well employed but
at any rate i was resting from that confounded
play now and then things gleamed on me clearly
for a space only to vanish just when i thought
i had hold of them sometimes my attention failed
altogether and i would give it up and sit and
stare at him wondering whether after all it would
not be better to use him as a central figure in a
good farce and let all this other stuff slide and
then perhaps i would catch on again for a bit

  at the earliest opportunity i went to see his
house it was large and carelessly furnished there

were no servants other than his three assistants
and his dietary and private life were characterised
by a philosophical simplicity he was a water-
drinker a vegetarian and all those logical dis-
ciplinary things but the sight of his equipment
settled many doubts it looked like business from
cellar to attic-an amazing little place to find in an
out-of-the-way village the ground-floor rooms
contained benches and apparatus the bakehouse
and scullery boiler had developed into respectable
furnaces dynamos occupied the cellar and there
was a gasometer in the garden he showed it to
me with all the confiding zest of a man who has
been living too much alone his seclusion was over-
flowing now in an excess of confidence and i had
the good luck to be the recipient

  the three assistants were creditable specimens
of the class of handy-men from which they came
conscientious if unintelligent strong civil and
willing one spargus who did the cooking and
all the metal work had been a sailor a second
gibbs was a joiner and the third was an ex-job-
bing gardener and now general assistant they
were the merest labourers all the intelligent work
was done by cavor theirs was the darkest ignor-
ance compared even with my muddled impression

  and now as to the nature of these inquiries
here unhappily comes a grave difficulty i am
no scientific expert and if i were to attempt to set
forth in the highly scientific language of mr
cavor the aim to which his experiments tended i
am afraid i should confuse not only the reader but
myself and almost certainly i should make some
blunder that would bring upon me the mockery of
every up-to-date student of mathematical physics
in the country the best thing i can do therefore
is i think to give my impressions in my own inex-
act language without any attempt to wear a gar-
ment of knowledge to which i have no claim

  the object of mr cavors search was a substance
that should be opaque-he used some other word
i have forgotten but opaque conveys the idea-
to all forms of radiant energy radiant
energy he made me understand was anything like
light or heat or those rontgen rays there was so
much talk about a year or so ago or the electric
waves of marconi or gravitation all these things
he said radiate out from centres and act on bodies
at a distance whence comes the term radiant
energy now almost all substances are opaque
to some form or other of radiant energy glass
for example is transparent to light but much less
so to heat so that it is useful as a fire-screen and
alum is transparent to light but blocks heat almost
completely a solution of iodine in carbon bisul-
phide on the other hand completely blocks light
but is quite transparent to heat it will hide a fire
from you but permit all its warmth to reach you
metals are not only opaque to light and heat but
also to radiant electrical energy which passes
through both iodine solution and glass almost as
though they were not interposed and so on

  now all known substances are transparent to
gravitation you can use screens of various sorts
to cut off the light or heat or electrical influence
of the sun or the warmth of the earth from any-
the first men in the moon

 

thing you can screen things by sheets of metal
from marconis rays but nothing will cut off the
gravitational attraction of the sun or the gravita-
tional attraction of the earth yet why there
should be nothing it is hard to say cavor did not
see why such a substance should not exist and
certainly i could not tell him i had never thought
of such a possibility before he showed me by
calculations on paper which lord kelvin no doubt
or professor lodge or professor karl pearson or
any of those great scientific people might have
understood but which simply reduced me to a
hopeless muddle that not only was such a sub-
stance possible but that it must satisfy certain
conditions it was an amazing piece of reasoning
much as it amazed and exercised me at the time
it would be impossible to reproduce it here yes
i said to it all yes go on suffice it for this
story that he believed he might be able to manu-
facture this possible substance opaque to gravita-
tion out of a complicated alloy of metals and some-
thing new-a new element i fancy-called i be-
lieve helium which was sent to him from london
in sealed stone jars doubt has been thrown upon
this detail but i am almost certain it was helium
he had sent him in sealed stone jars it was cer-
tainly something very gaseous and thin if only
i had taken notes   

  but then how was i to foresee the necessity of
taking notes

  any one with the merest germ of an imagination
will understand the extraordinary possibilities of
such a substance and will sympathise a little with
the emotion i felt as this understanding emerged
from the haze of abstruse phrases in which cavor
expressed himself comic relief in a play indeed
it was some time before i would believe that i
had interpreted him aright and i was very careful
not to ask questions that would have enabled him
to gauge the profundity of misunderstanding into
which he dropped his daily exposition but no one
reading the story of it here will sympathise fully
because from my barren narrative it will be im-
possible to gather the strength of my conviction
that this astonishing substance was positively going
to be made	

  i do not recall that i gave my play an hours
consecutive work at any time after my visit to his
house my imagination had other things to do
there seemed no limit to the possibilities of the
stuff whichever way i tried i came on miracles
and revolutions for example if one wanted to
lift a weight however enormous one had only to
get a sheet of this substance beneath it and one
might lift it with a straw my first natural impulse
was to apply this principle to guns and ironclads
and all the material and methods of war and from
that to shipping locomotion building every con-
ceivable form of human industry the chance that
had brought me into the very birth-chamber of
this new time-it was an epoch no less-was one
of those chances that come once in a thousand years
the thing unrolled it expanded and expanded
among other things i saw in it my redemption as a
business man i saw a parent company and daugh-
ter companies applications to right of us applica-

tions to left rings and trusts privileges and con-
cessions spreading and spreading until one vast
stupendous cavorite company ran and ruled the
world

  and i was in it

  i took my line straight away i knew i was
staking everything but i jumped there and then

  were on absolutely the biggest thing that has
ever been invented i said and put the accent
on we if you want to keep me out of this
youll have to do it with a gun im coming down
to be your fourth labourer to-morrow

  he seemed surprised at my enthusiasm but not
a bit suspicious or hostile bather he was self-
depreciatory

  he looked at me doubtfully but do you really
think- he said and your play i how about
that play

  its vanished i cried my dear sir dont
you see what youve got dont you see what
youre going to do

  that was merely a rhetorical turn but positively
he didnt at first i could not believe it he had
not had the beginning of the inkling of an idea
this astonishing little man had been working on
purely theoretical grounds the whole time when
he said it was the most important research the
world had ever seen he simply meant it squared
up so many theories settled so much that was in
doubt he had troubled no more about the appli-
cation of the stuff he was going to turn out than if
he had been a machine that makes guns this was
a possible substance and he was going to make it
vla tout as the frenchman says

  beyond that he was childish if he made it
it would go down to posterity as -cavorite or cavor-
ine and he would be made an frs and his por-
trait given away as a scientific worthy with nature
and things like that and that was all he saw
he would have dropped this -bombshell into the
world as though he had discovered a new species of
gnat if it had not happened that i had come along
and there it would have lain and fizzled like
one or two other little things these scientific people
have lit and dropped about us

  when i realised this it was i did the talking
and cavor who said go on i jumped up i
paced the room gesticulating like a boy of twenty
i tried to make him understand his duties and
responsibilities in the matter-our duties and re-
sponsibilities in the matter i assured him we
might make wealth enough to work any sort of
social revolution we fancied we might own and
order the whole world i told him of companies and
patents and the case for secret processes all
these things seemed to take him much as his mathe-
matics had taken me a look of perplexity came
into his ruddy little face he stammered something
about indifference to wealth but i brushed all
that aside he had got to be rich and it was no
good his stammering i gave him to understand
the sort of man i was and that i had had very
considerable business experience i did not tell
him i was an undischarged bankrupt at the time
because that was temporary but i think i reconciled
my evident poverty with my financial claims and


amazing stories

  quite insensibly in the way such projects grow
  the understanding of a cavorite monopoly grew
  up between us he was to make the stuff and i
  was to make the boom

    i stuck like a leech to the we-you and i
  didnt exist for me

    his idea was that the profits i spoke of might
  go to endow research but that of course was a
  matter we had to settle later thats all right
  i shouted thats all right the great point
  as i insisted was to get the thing done

   here is a substance i cried no home no
 factory no fortress no ship can dare to be without
 -more universally applicable even than a patent
 medicine there isnt a solitary aspect of it not
 one of its ten thousand possible uses that will not
 make us rich cavor beyond the dreams of avarice
 no i he said i begin to see its extraordi-
 nary how one gets new points of view by talking
 over things

    and as it happens you have just talked to the
  right man

   i suppose no one he said is absolutely
 averse to enormous wealth of course there is one

 thing-

    he paused i stood still

    it is just possible you know that we may not
  be able to make it after all it may be one of
  those things that are a theoretical possibility but
  a practical absurdity or when we make it there

 may be some little hitch-

    well tackle the hitch when it comes said i

chapter ii

the first making of cavorite

 but cavors fears were groundless so far as
 the actual making was concerned on the
 th of october  this incredible sub-
 stance was made

    oddly enough it was made at last by accident
  when mr cavor least expected it he had fused
  together a number of metals and certain other
  things-i wish i knew the particulars now-and
  he intended to leave the mixture a week and then
  allow it to cool slowly unless he had miscalculated
  the last stage in the combination would occur when
  the stuff sank to a temperature of  fahr but
  it chanced that unknown to cavor dissension had
  arisen about the furnace tending gibbs who had
  previously seen to this had suddenly attempted
  to shift it to the man who had been a gardener on
  the score that coal was soil being dug and therefore
  v could not possibly fall within the province of a
  joiner the man who had been a jobbing gardener
  alleged however that coal was a metallic or ore-
  like substance let alone that he was cook but
  spargus insisted on gibbs doing the coaling seeing
  that he was a joiner and that coal is notoriously
  fossil wood consequently gibbs ceased to replen-
  ish the furnace and no one else did so and cavor
  was too much immersed in certain interesting prob-
  lems concerning a cavorite flying machine neglect-
  ing the resistance of the air and one or two other
  points to perceive that anything was wrong and
  thp	bfrh n his invention took place

just as he was coming across the field to my
bungalow for our afternoon talk and tea

  i remember the occasion with extreme vividness
the water was boiling and everything was pre-
pared and the sound of his zuezoo had brought
me out upon the verandah his active little figure
was black against the autumnal sunset and to the
right the chimneys of his house just rose above
a gloriously tinted group of trees remoter rose the
wealden hills faint and blue while to the left
the hazy marsh spread out spacious and serene and
then-

  the chimneys jerked heavenward smashing into
a string of bricks as they rose and the roof and a
miscellany of furniture followed then overtaking
them came a huge white flame the trees about the
building swayed and whirled and tore themselves
to pieces that sprang towards the flare my ears
were smitten with a clap of thunder that left me
deaf on one side for life and all about me win-
dows smashed unheeded

  i took three steps from the verandah towards
cavors house and even as i did so came the wind

  instantly my coat tails were over my head and
i was progressing in great leaps and bounds and
quite against my will towards him in the same
moment the discoverer was seized whirled about
and flew through the screaming air i saw one of
my chimney pots hit the ground within six yards
of me leap a score of feet and so hurry in great
strides towards the focus of the disturbance cavor
kicking and flapping came down again rolled over
and over on the ground for a space struggled
up and was lifted and borne forward at an enor-
mous velocity vanishing at last among the labour-
ing lashing trees that writhed about his house

  a mass of smoke and ashes and a square of
bluish shining substance rushed up towards the
zenith a large fragment of fencing came sailing
past me dropped edgeways hit the ground and
fell flat and then the worst was over the aerial
commotion fell swiftly until it was a mere strong
gale and i became once more aware that i had
breath and feet by leaning back against the wind
i managed to stop and could collect such wits as
still remained to me

  in that instant the whole face of the world had
changed the tranquil sunset had vanished the
sky was dark with scurrying clouds everything was
flattened and swaying with the gale i glanced
back to see if my bungalow was still in a general
way standing then staggered forward towards the
trees amongst which cavor had vanished and
through whose tall and leaf-denuded branches shone
the flames of his burning house

  i entered the copse dashing from one tree to
another and clinging to them and for a space i
sought him in vain then amidst a heap of smashed
branches and fencing that had banked itself against
a portion of his garden wall i perceived something
stir  made a run for this but before i reached
it a brown object separated itself rose on two
muddy legs and protruded two drooping bleeding
hands some tattered ends of garment fluttered
out from its middle portion and streamed before
the wind
the first men in the moon



  for a moment i did not recognise this earthy
lump and then i saw that it was cavor caked in
the mud in whioh he had rolled he leant forward
against the wind rubbing the dirt from his eyes
and mouth

  he extended a muddy lump of hand and staggered
a pace towards me his face worked with emotion
little lumps of mud kept falling from it he looked
as damaged and pitiful as any living creature i
have ever seen and his remark therefore amazed
me exceedingly gratulate me he gasped
gratulate me

  congratulate you said i good heavens
what for

  ive done it

  you have what on earth caused that explo-
sion

  a gust of wind blew his words away i under-
stood him to say that it wasnt an explosion at all
the wind hurled me into collision with him and
we stood clinging to one another

  try and get back to my bungalow i bawled
in his ear he did not hear me and shouted some-
thing about three martyrs-science and also
something about not much good at the time
he laboured under the impression that his three
attendants had perished in the whirlwind happily
this was incorrect directly he had left for my
bungalow they had gone off to the public-house in
lympne to discuss the question of the furnaces
over some trivial refreshment

  i repeated my suggestion of getting back to
my bungalow and this time he understood we
clung arm-in-arm and started and managed at
last to reach the shelter of as much roof as was left
to me for a space we sat in arm-chairs and panted
all the windows were broken and the lighter
articles of furniture were in great disorder but no
irrevocable damage was done happily the kitchen
door had stood the pressure upon it so that all my
crockery and cooking materials had survived the
oil stove was still burning and i put on the water
to boil again for tea and that prepared i could
turn on cavor for his explanation

  quite correct he insisted quite correct ive
done it and its all right

  but i protested all right why there
cant be a rick standing or a fence or a thatched
roof undamaged for twenty miles round  

  its all right-really i didnt of course foresee
this little upset my mind was preoccupied with
another problem and im apt to disregard these

practical side issues but its all right-

  my dear sir i cried dont you see youve
done thousands of pounds worth of damage
there i throw myself on your discretion im
not a practical man of course but dont you think
they will regard it as a cyclone

  but the explosion-

  it was not an explosion its perfectly simple
only as i say im apt to overlook these little things
its that zuzzoo business on a larger scale inad-
vertently i made this substance of mine this
cavofite in a thin wide sheet   

  it rr yii jr onit pvfr fvi fhr

is opaque to gravitation that it cuts off things from
gravitating towards each other

  yes said i yes

  well so soon as it reached a temperature of
 fahr and the process of its manufacture was
complete the air above it the portions of roof and
ceiling and floor above it ceased to have weight i
suppose you know-everybody knows nowadays-
that as a usual thing the air has weight that it
presses on everything at the surface of the earth
presses in all directions with a pressure of fourteen
and a half pounds to the square inch

  i know that said l go on

  i know that too he remarked only this
shows you how useless knowledge is unless you ap-
ply it you see over our cavorite this ceased to be
the case the air there ceased to exert any pressure
and the air around it and not over the cavorite was
exerting a pressure of fourteen pounds and a half
to the square inch upon this suddenly weightless
air ah you begin to see the air all about the
cavorite crushed in upon the air above it with ir-
resistible force the air above the cavorite was
forced upward violently the air that rushed in to re-
place it immediately lost weight ceased to exert any
pressure followed suit blew the ceiling through
and the roof off   

  tou perceive he said it formed a sort f
atmospheric fountain a kind of chimney in the at-
mosphere and if the cavorite itself hadnt been
loose and so got sucked up the chimney does it
occur to you what would have happened

  i thought i suppose i said the air would
be rushing up and up over that infernal piece of
stuff now

  precisely he said a huge fountain-

  spouting into space good heavens why it
would have squirted all the atmosphere of the earth
away it would have robbed the world of air
it would have been the death of all mankind that
little lump of stuff

  not exactly into space said cavor but as
bad-practically it would have whipped the air
off the world as one peels a banana and flung it
thousands of miles it would have dropped back
again of course-but on an asphyxiated world
from our point of view very little better than if it
never came back

  i stared as yet i was too amazed to realize
how all my expectations had been upset what
do you mean to do now i asked

  in the first place if i may borrow a garden
trowel i will remove some of this earth with which
i am encased and then if i may avail myself of
your domestic conveniences i will have a bath
this done we will converse more at leisure it
will be wise i think-he laid a muddy hand on
my arm-if nothing were said of this affair be-
yond ourselves i know i have caused great damage
-probably even dwelling-houses may be ruined
here and there upon the country-side but on the
other hand i cannot possibly pay for the damage
i have done and if the real cause of this is pub-
lished it will lead only to heartburning and the ob-
struction of my work one cannot foresee every-
thing you know and i cannot consent for one

amazing stories

tiotis to my theorising later on when you have
come in with your practical mind and cavorite is
floated-floated is the word isnt it-and it has
realised all you anticipate for it we may set matters
right with these persons but not now-not now
if no other explanation is offered people in the
present unsatisfactory state of meteorological
science will ascribe all this to a cyclone there might
be a public subscription and as my house has col-
lapsed and been burnt i should in that case receive
a considerable share in the compensation which
would be extremely helpful to the prosecution of
our researches but if it is known that i caused
this there will be no public subscription and
everybody will be put out practically i should
never get a chance of working in peace again my
three assistants may or may not have perished
that is a detail if they have it is no great loss
they were more zealous than able and this pre-
mature event must be largely due to their joint
neglect of the furnace if they have not perished
i doubt if they have the intelligence to explain the
affair they will accept the cyclone story and if
during the temporary unfitness of my house for oc-
cupation i may lodge in one of the untenanted
rooms of this bungalow of yours-

  he paused and regarded me

  a man of such possibilities i reflected is no
ordinary guest to entertain

  perhaps said i rising to my feet we had
better begin by looking for a trowel and i led
the way to the scattered vestiges of the greenhouse

  and while he was having his bath i considered
the entire question alone it was clear there were
drawbacks to mr cavors society i had not fore-
seen the absent-mindedness that had just escaped
depopulating the terrestrial globe might at any
moment result in some other grave inconvenience
on the other hand i was young my affairs were in
a mess and i was in just the mood for reckless
adventure-with a chance of something good at the
end of it i had quite settled in my mind that i
was to have half at least in that aspect of the affair
fortunately i held my bungalow as i have already
explained on a three-year agreement without being
responsible for repairs and my furniture such as
there was of it had been hastily purchased was
unpaid for insured and altogether devoid of as-
sociations in the end i decided to keep on with
him and see the business through 

  certainly the aspect of things had changed very
greatly i no longer doubted at all the enormous
possibilities of the substance but i began to have
doubts about the gun-carriage and the patent boots

  we set to work at once to reconstruct his labora-
tory and proceed with our experiments cavor
talked more on my level than he had ever done
before when it came to the question of how we
should make the stuff next

  of course we must make it again he said
with a sort of glee i had not expected in him of
course we must make it again we have caught
a tartar perhaps but we have left the theoretical
behind us for good and all if we can possibly
avoid wrecking this little planet of ours we will
but-there must be risks there must be in ex-

perimental work there always are and here as a
practical man you must come in for my own
part it seems to me we might make it edgeways
perhaps and very thin yet i dont know i have
a certain dim perception of another method i can
hardly explain it yet but curiously enough it
came into my mind while i was rolling over and
over in the mud before the wind and very doubtful
how the whole adventure was to end as being
absolutely the thing i ought to have done

  even with my aid we found some little difficulty
and meanwhile we kept at work restoring the
laboratory there was plenty to do before it was
absolutely necessary to decide upon the precise form
and method of our second attempt our only hitch
was the strike of the three labourers who objected
to my activity as a foreman but that matter we
compromised after two days delay

chapter iii

the building of the sphere

i remember the occasion very distinctly when
cavor told me of his idea of the sphere he
had had intimations of it before but at the
time it seemed to come to him in a rush we
were returning to the bungalow for tea and on
the way he fell humming suddenly he shouted
thats it that finishes it a sort of roller
blind

  finishes what i asked

  space-anywhere the moon

  what do you mean

  mean why-it must be a sphere thats
what i mean

  i saw i was out of it and for a time i let him
talk in his own fashion i hadnt the ghost of an
idea then of his drift but after he had taken tea
he made it clear to me

  its like this he said last time i ran this
stuff that cuts things off from gravitation into a
flat tank with an overlap that held it down and
directly it had cooled and the manufacture was
completed all that uproar happened nothing above
it weighed anything the air went squirting up the
house squirted up and if the stuff itself hadnt
squirted up too i dont know what would have
happened but suppose the substance is loose
and quite free to go up

  it will go up at once

  exactly with no more disturbance than firing
a big gun

  but what good will that do

  im going up with it

  i put down my teacup and stared at him
imagine a sphere he explained large enough
to hold two people and their luggage it will be
made of steel lined with thick glass it will contain
a proper store of solidified air concentrated food
water-distilling apparatus and so forth and
enamelled as it were on the outer steels--
cavorite

  yes

  but how will you get inside

  there was a similar problem about a dumpling
  yes i know but how
the first men in the moon



  thats perfectly easy an air-tight manhole
is all that is needed that of course will have
to be a little complicated there will have to be a
valve so that things may be thrown out if neces-
sary without much loss of air

  like jules vernes thing in a trip to the moon
  but cavor was not a reader of fiction

  i begin to see i said slowly and you could
get in and screw yourself up while the cavorite was
warm and as soon as it cooled it would become
impervious to gravitation and off you would

fly-

  at a tangent

  you would go off in a straight line- i

stopped abruptly what is to prevent the thing
travelling in a straight line into space for ever

i asked youre not safe to get anywhere and
if you do-how will you get back

  ive just thought of that said cavor thats
what i meant when i said the thing is finished the
inner glass sphere can be air-tight and except for
the manhole continuous and the steel sphere can
be made in sections each section capable of rolling
up after the fashion of a roller blind these can
easily be worked by springs and released and check-
ed by electricity conveyed by platinum wires fused
through the glass all that is merely a question
of detail so you see that except for the thickness
of the blind rollers the cavorite exterior of the
sphere will consist of windows or blinds whichever
you like to call them well when all these windows
or blinds are shut no light no heat no gravitation
no radiant energy of any sort will get at the inside
of the sphere it will fly on through space in a
straight line as you say but open a window
imagine one of the windows open then at once
any heavy body that chances to be in that direction

will attract us-

  i sat taking it in

  you see he said

  oh i see

  practically we shall be able to tack about in
space just as we wish get attracted by this and
that

  oh yes thats clear enough only-

  well

  i dont quite see what we shall do it for its
reafly only jumping off the world and back again
surely for example one might go to the
moon

  and when one got there what would you
find

 we should see- oh consider the new

knowledge

  is there air there

  there may be

  its a fine idea i said but it strikes me as
a large order all the same the moon id much
rather try some smaller things first

  theyre out of the question because of the air
difficulty

  why not apply that idea of spring blinds-
cavorite blinds in strong steel cases-to lifting
weights

  it wouldnt work he insisted after all to
go into outer space is not so much worse if at all

than a polar expedition men go on polar expedi-
tions

  not business men and besides they get paid
for polar expeditions and if anything goes wrong
there are relief parties but this-its just firing
ourselves off the world for nothing

  call it prospecting

  youll have to call it that    one might
make a book of it perhaps i said

  i have no doubt there will be minerals said
cavor

  for example

  oh sulphur ores gold perhaps possibly new
elements

  cost of carriage i said you know youre
not a practical man the moons a quarter of a
million miles away

  it seems to me it wouldnt cost much to cart
any weight anywhere if you packed it in a cavor-
ite case

  i had not thought of that delivered free on
head of purchaser eh

  it isnt as though we were confined to the
moon

 you mean-

  theres mars-clear atmosphere novel sur-
roundings exhilarating sense of lightness it
might be pleasant to go there

  is there air on mars

  oh yes

  seems as though you might run it as a sana-
torium by the way how far is mars 

  two hundred million miles at present said
cavor airily and you go close by the sun

  my imagination was picking itself up again
after all i said theres something in these

things theres travel-

  an extraordinary possibility came rushing into
my mind suddenly i saw as in a vision the whole
solar system threaded with cavorite liners and
spheres de luxe rights of preemption came
floating into my head-planetary rights of pre-
emption i recalled the old spanish monopoly in
american gold it wasnt as though it was just
this planet or that-it was all of them i stared at
cavors rubicund face and suddenly my imagina-
tion was leaping and dancing i stood up i walked
up and down my tongue was unloosened

  im beginning to take it in i said im be-
ginning to take it in the transition from doubt
to enthusiasm seemed to take scarcely any time at
all but this is tremendous i cried this
is imperial i havent been dreaming of this sort
of thing

  once the chill of my opposition was removed
his own pent-up excitement had play he too
got up and paced he too gesticulated and shout-
ed we behaved like men inspired we were men
inspired

  well settle all that he said in answer to some
incidental difficulty that had pulled me up well
soon settle all that well start the drawings for
mouldings this very night

  well start them now i responded and we
hurried off to the laboratory to begin upon this
work forthwith

  i was like a child in wonderland all that night


amazing stories

the dawn found us both still at work-we kept our
electric light going heedless of the day i remem-
ber now exactly how those drawings looked i
shaded and tinted while cavor drew-smudged
and haste-marked they were in every line but
wonderfully correct we got out the orders for
the steel blinds and frames we needed from that
nights work and the glass sphere was designed
within a week we gave up our afternoon conver-
sations and our old routine altogether we worked
and we slept and ate when we could work no longer
for hunger and fatigue our enthusiasm infected
even our three men though they had no idea what
the sphere was for through those days the man
gibbs gave up walking and went everywhere even
across the room at a sort of fussy run

 and it grew-the sphere december passed
january-i spent a day with a broom sweeping a
path through the snow from bungalow to labora-
tory-february march by the end of march the
completion was in sight in january had come a
team of horses a huge packing-case we had our
thick glass sphere now ready and in position un-
der the crane we had rigged to sling it into the
steel shell all the bars and blinds of the steel
shell-it was not really a spherical shell but poly-
hedral with a roller blind to each facet-had ar-
rived by february and the lower half was bolted
together the cavorite was half made by march
the metallic paste had gone through two of the
stages in its manufacture and we had plastered
quite half of it on to the steel bars and blinds it
was astonishing how closely we kept to the line of
cavors first inspiration in working out the
scheme when the bolting together of the sphere
was finished he proposed to remove the rough roof
of the temporary laboratory in which the work was
done and build a furnace about it so the last
atage of cavorite making in which the paste is
heated to a dull red glow in a stream of helium
would be accomplished when it was already on the
sphere

  and then we had to discuss and decide what
provisions we were to take-compressed foods con-
centrated essences steel cylinders containing re-
serve oxygen an arrangement for removing car-
bonic acid and waste from the air and restoring
oxygen by means of sodium peroxide water con-
densers and so forth i remember the little heap
they made in the corner-tins and rolls and boxes
-convincingly matter-of-fact

  it was a strenuous time with little chance of
thinking but one day when we were drawing near
the end an odd mood came over me i had been
bricking up the furnace all the morning and i sat
down by these possessions dead beat everything
seemed dull and incredible

  but look here cavor i said after all
whats it all for

  he smiled the thing now is to go

  the moon i reflected but what do you ex-
pect i thought the moon was a dead world

  he shrugged his shoulders

  what do you expect

  were going to see

  are wp t said and starpd bpfore me

  you are tired he remarked youd better

take a walk this afternoon

  no i said obstinately im going to finish this
brickwork

  and i did and insured myself a night of in-
somnia

  i dont think i have ever had such a night i
had some bad times before my business collapse
but the very worst of these was sweet slumber com-
pared to this infinity of aching wakefulness i was
suddenly in the most enormous funk at the thing
we were going to do

  i do not remember before that night thinking at
all of the risks we were running now they came
like that array of spectres that once beleaguered
prague and camped around me the strangeness
of what we were about to do the unearthliness of
it overwhelmed me i was like a man awakened
out of pleasant dreams to the most horrible sur-
roundings i lay eyes wide open and the sphere
seemed to get more flimsy and feeble and cavor
more unreal and fantastic and the whole enterprise
madder and madder every moment

  i got out of bed and wandered about i sat at
the window and stared at the immensity of space
between the stars was the void the unfathomable
darkness i tried to recall the fragmentary knowl-
edge of astronomy i had gained in my irregular
reading but it was all too vague to furnish any
idea of the things we might expect at last i got
back to bed and snatched some moments of sleep-
moments of nightmare rather-in which i fell
and fell and fell for evermore into the abyss of the
sky

i astonished cavor at breakfast i told him
shortly im not coming with you in the sphere
i met all his protests with a sullen persistence
the things too mad i said and i wont come
the things too mad

  i would not go with him to the laboratory i
fretted about my bungalow for a time and then
took hat and stick and set off alone i knew not
whither it chanced to be a glorious morning a
warm wind and deep blue sky the first green of
spring abroad and multitudes of birds singing i
lunched on beef and beer in a little public-house
near elham and startled the landlord by remarking
apropos of the weather a man who leaves the
world when days of this sort are about is a fooll
thats what i says when i heerd on it said the
landlord and i found that for one poor soul at least
this world had proved excessive and there had been
a throat-cutting i went on with a new twist to
my thoughts

  in the afternoon i had a pleasant sleep in a sunny
place and went my way refreshed

  i came to a comfortable-looking inn near canter-
bury it was bright with creepers and the land-
lady was a clean old woman and took my eye i
found i had just enough money to pay for my
lodging with her i decided to stop the night there
she was a talkative body and among many other
particulars i learnt she had never been to london
canterburys as far as ever i been she said
im not one of your gad-about sort

  how would you like a trip to the moon i cried
  i never did hold with them ballooneys she said
the first men in the moon



evidently nnder the impression that thi was a
common excursion enough i wouldnt go up in
one-not for ever so

  this struck me as being funny after i had
supped i sat on a bench by the door of the inn
and gossiped with two labourers about brick-mak-
ing and motor cars and the cricket of last year
and in the sky a faint new crescent blue and vague
as a distant alp sank westward over the sun

  the next day i returned to cavor i am com-
ing i said ive been a little out of order thats
all

  that was the only time i felt any serious doubt
of our enterprise nerves purely after that i
worked a little more carefully and took a trudge for
an hour every day and at last save for the heating
in the furnace our labours were at an end

chapter iv
inside the sphere

on said cavor as i sat across the edge
f -w- of the manhole and looked down into the
v-l black interior of the sphere we two were
alone it was evening the sun had set and the
stillness of the twilight was upon everything

  i drew my other leg inside and slid down the
smooth glass to the bottom of the sphere then
turned to take the cans of food and other impedi-
menta from cavor the interior was warm the
thermometer stood at eighty and as we should lose
little or none of this by radiation we were dressed
in shoes and thin flannels we had however a
bundle of thick woolen clothing and several thick
blankets to guard against mischance by cavors
direction i placed the packages the cylinders of
oxygen and so forth loosely about my feet and
soon we had everything in he walked about the
roofless shed for a time seeking anything we had
overlooked and then crawled in after me i noted
something in his hand

  what have you got there i asked

  havent you brought anything to read
  good lord no

  i forgot to tell you there are uncertainties-

the voyage may last- we may be weeks

 but-

  we shall be floating in this sphere with ab-
solutely no occupation

  i wish id known-

  he peered out of the manhole look he said
theres something there

  is there time

  we shall be an hour

  i looked out it was an old number of tit-bits
that one of the men must have brought farther
away in the corner i saw a torn lloyds neivs i
scrambled back into the sphere with these things
what have you got i said

  i took the book from his hand and read the
worjcs of wiuiam shakespeare

  he coloured slightly my education has been

so purely scientific- he said apologetically

  never read him

  never

  he knew a little you know-in an irregular
sort of way

  precisely what i am told said cavor

  i assisted him to screw in the glass cover of the
manhole and then he pressed a stud to close the
corresponding blind in the outer case the little
oblong of twilight vanished we were in darkness

  for a time neither of us spoke although our
case would not be impervious to sound everything
was very still i perceived there was nothing to
grip when the shock of our start should come and
i realised that i should be uncomfortable for want
of a chair

  why have we no chairs i asked

  ive settled all that said cavor we shant
need them

  why not

  tou will see he said in the tone of a man who
refuses to talk

  i became silent suddenly it had come to me
clear and vivid that i was a fool to be inside that
sphere even now i asked myself is it too late to
withdraw the world outside the sphere i knew
would be cold and inhospitable enough to me-for
weeks i had been living on subsidies from cavor-
but after all would it be as cold as the infinite
zero as inhospitable as empty space if it had
not been for the appearance of cowardice i believe
that even then i should have made him let me
out but i hesitated on that score and hesitated
and grew fretful and angry and the time passed

  there came a little jerk a noise like champagne
being uncorked in another room and a faint whist-
ling sound for just one instant i had a sense of
enormous tension a transient conviction that my
feet were pressing downward with a force of count-
less tons it lasted for an infinitesimal time

  but it stirred me to action cavor i said
into the darkness my nerves in rags  i dont
think-

  i stopped he made no answer

  confound it i cried im a fool what busi-
ness have i here im not coming cavor the
things too risky im getting out

  you cant he said

  he made no answer for ten seconds its too
late for us to quarrel now bedford he said that
little jerk was the start already we are flying as
swiftly as a bullet up into the gulf of space

  i- i said and then it didnt seem to matter

what happened for a time i was as it were
stunned i had nothing to say it was just as if i
had never heard of this idea of leaving the world
before then i perceived an unaccountable change
in my bodily sensations it was a feeling of light-
ness of unreality coupled with that was a queer
sensation in the head an apoplectic effect almost
and a thumping of blood-vessels at the ears neither
of these feelings diminished as time went on but
at last i got so used to them that i experienced no
inconvenience

  i heard a click and a little glow lamp came into
being

  i saw cavors face as white as i felt my own to
be we regarded one another in silence the trans-
parent blackness of the glass behind him made him
seem as though he floated in a void

  well were committed i said at last

  tes he said were committed


amazing stories

  dont move he exclaimed at bome suggestion
of a gesture let your muscles keep quite lax
-as if you were in bed we are in a little universe
of our own look at those things

  he pointed to the loose cases and bundles that had
been lying on the blankets in the bottom of the
sphere i was astonished to see that they were
floating now nearly a foot from the spherical wall
then i saw from his shadow that cavor was no
longer leaning against the glass i thrust out my
hand behind me and found that i too was suspend-
ed in space clear of the glass

  i did not cry nor gesticulate but fear came upon
me it was like being held and lifted by something
-you know not what the mere touch of my hand
against the glass moved me rapidly i understood
what had happened but that did not prevent my
being afraid we were cut off from all exterior
gravitation only the attraction of objects within
our sphere had effect consequently everything
that was not fixed to the glass was falling-slowly
because of the slightness of our masses-towards
the centre of gravity of our little world which seem-
ed to be somewhere about the middle of the sphere
but rather nearer to myself than cavor on account
of my greater weight

  we must turn round said cavor and float
back to back with the things between us

  it was the strangest sensation conceivable float-
ing thus loosely in space at first indeed horribly
strange and when the horror passed not disagree-
able at all exceedingly restful indeed the nearest
thing to it in earthly experience that i know is
lying on a very thick soft feather bed but the
quality of utter detachment and independence i
had not reckoned on things like this i had ex-
pected a violent jerk at starting a giddy sense of
speed instead i felt-as if i were disembodied it
was not like the beginning of a journey it was like
the beginning of a dream

chapter v
the journey to the moon

presently cavor extinguished the light
he said we had not overmuch energy stored
and that what we had we must economise for
reading for a time whether it was long or short
i do not know there was nothing but blank dark-
ness

  a question floated up out of the void how are
we pointing i said what is our direction

  we are flying away from the earth at a tangent
and as the moon is near her third quarter we are
going somewhere towards her i will open a
blind-

  came a click and then a window in the outer
case yawned open the sky outside was as black
as the darkness within the sphere but the shape of
the open window was marked by an infinite number
of stars

  those who have only seen the starry sky from
the earth cannot imagine its appearance when the
vague half-luminous veil of our air has been with-
drawn the stars we see on earth are the mere
scattered survivors that penetrate our misty atmo-

sphere but now at last i could realise the meaning
of the hosts of heaven

  stranger things we were presently to see but
that airless star-dusted sky of all things i think
that will be one of the last i shall forget

  the little window vanished with a click another
beside it snapped open and instantly closed and
then a third and for a moment i had to close my
eyes because of the blinding splendour of the
waning moon

  for a space i had to stare at cavor and the
white-lit things about me to season my eyes to light
again before i could turn them towards that pallid
glare

  four windows were open in order that the grav-
itation of the moon might act upon all the sub-
stances in our sphere i found i was no longer
floating freely in space but that my feet were
resting on the glass in the direction of the moon
the blankets and cases of provisions were also
creeping slowly down the glass and presently came
to rest so as to block out a portion of the view
it seemed to me of course that i looked down
when i looked at the moon on earth down
means earthward the way things fall and up the
reverse direction now the pull of gravitation was
towards the moon and for all i knew to the contrary
our earth was overhead and of course when all
the cavorite blinds were closed down was to-
wards the centre of our sphere and up towards
its outer wall

  it was curiously unlike earthly experience too
to have the light coming up to one on earth light
falls from above or comes slanting down sideways
but here it came from beneath our feet and to
see our shadows we had to look up

  at first it gave me a sort of vertigo to stand only
on thick glass and look down upon the moon through
hundreds of thousands of miles of vacant space
but this sickness passed very speedily and then
-the splendour of the sight

  the reader may imagine it best if he will lie on
the ground some warm summers night and look
between his upraised feet at the moon but for
some reason probably because the absence of air
made it so much more luminous the moon seemed
already considerably larger than it does from earth
the minutest details of its surface were acutely
clear and since we did not see it through air
its outline was bright and sharp there was no glow
or halo about it and the star-dust that covered the
sky came right to its very margin and marked the
outline of its unilluminated part and as i stood
and stared at the moon between my feet that per-
ception of the impossible that had been with me
off and on ever since our start returned again with
tenfold conviction

  cavor i said this takes me queerly those
companies we were going to run and all that about
minerals 

  i dont see em here

  no said cavor but youll get over all that

  i suppose im made to turn right side up again

still this- for a moment i could half believe

there never was a world

  that copy of lloyds news might help you

  i stared at the paper for a moment then held
the first men in the moon



it above the level of my face and found i could
read it quite easily i struck a column of mean
little advertisements a gentleman of private
means is willing to lend money i read i knew
that gentleman then somebody eccentric wanted
to sell a cutaway bicycle quite new and cost 
for five pounds and a lady in distress wished to
dispose of some fish knives and forks a wedding
present at a great sacrifice no doubt some sim-
ple soul was sagely examining these knives and
forks and another triumphantly riding off on that
bicycle and a third trustfully consulting that
benevolent gentleman of means even as i read i
laughed and let the paper drift from my hand
are we visible from the earth i asked

 why

  i knew some one who was rather interested in
astronomy it occurred to me that it would be
rather odd if-my friend-chanced to be looking
through some telescope

  it would need the most powerful telescope on
earth even now to see us as the minutest speck
for a time i stared in silence at the moon

  its a world i said one feels that infinitely
more than one ever did on earth people per-
haps-

  people he exclaimed no banish all that
think yourself a sort of ultra-arctic voyager ex-
ploring the desolate places of space look at it
he waved his hand at the shining whiteness be-
low its dead-dead vast extinct volcanoes
lava wildernesses tumbled wastes of snow or frozen
carbonic acid or frozen air and everywhere land-
slip seams and cracks and gulfs nothing happens
men have watched this planet systematically with
telescopes for over two hundred years how much
change do you- think they have seen

  none

  they have traced two indisputable landslips a
doubtful crack and one slight periodic change of
colour and thats all

  i didnt know theyd traced even that

  oh yes but as for people

  by the way i asked how small a thing will
the biggest telescopes show upon the moon

  one could see a fair-sized church one could
certainly see any towns or buildings or anything
like the handiwork of men there might perhaps
be insects something in the way of ants for ex-
ample so that they could hide in deep burrows from
the lunar night or some new sort of creatures
having no earthly parallel that is the most prob-
able thing if we are to find life there at all think
of the difference in conditions life must fit itself
to a day as long as fourteen earthly days a cloudless
sun-blaze of fourteen days and then a night of
equal length growing ever colder and colder under
these cold sharp stars in that night there must
be cold the ultimate cold absolute zero c
below the earthly freezing point whatever life
there is must hibernate through that and rise again
each day

  he mused one can imagine something worm-
like he said taking its air solid as an earth-worm
swallows earth or thick-skinned monsters-

  by the bye i said why didnt we bring ft
gun

  he did not answer that question no he con-
cluded we just have to go we shall see when
we get there

  i remembered something of course there
my minerals anyhow i said whatever the condi-
tions may be

  presently he told me he wished to alter our course
a little by letting the earth tug at us for a moment
he was going to open one earthward blind fon
thirty seconds he warned me that it would make
my head swim and advised me to extend my hands
against the glass to break my fall i did as he
directed and thrust my feet against the bales of
food cases and air cylinders to prevent their falling
upon me then with a click the window flew open
i fell clumsily upon hands and face and saw for a
moment between my black extended fingers our
mother earth-a planet in a downward sky

  we were still very near-cavor told me the dis-
tance was perhaps eight hundred miles and the
huge terrestrial disc filled all heaven but already
it was plain to see that the world was a globe
the land below us was in twilight and vague but
westward the vast gray stretches of the atlantic
shone like molten silver under the receding day
i think i recognised the cloud-dimmed coast-linea
of france and spain and the south of england
and then with a click the shutter closed again and
i found myself in a state of extraordinary confusion
sliding slowly over the smooth glass

  when at last things settled themselves in my
mind again it seemed quite beyond question that
the moon was down and under my feet and that
the earth was somewhere away on the level of the
horizon-the earth that had been down to me
and my kindred since the beginning of things

  so slight were the exertions required of us so
easy did the practical annihilation of our weight
make all we had to do that the necessity for taking
refreshment did not occur to us for nearly six hours
by cavors chronometer after our start i was
amazed at that lapse of time even then i was
satisfied with very little cavor examined the ap-
paratus for absorbing carbonic acid and water and
pronounced it to be in satisfactory order our con-
sumption of oxygen having been extraordinarily
slight and our talk being exhausted for the time
and there being nothing further for us to do we
gave way to a curious drowsiness that had come
upon us and spreading our blankets on the bottom
of the sphere in such a manner as to shut out most
of the moonlight wished each other good-night and
almost immediately fell asleep

  and so sleeping and sometimes talking and read-
ing a little and at times eating although without
any keenness of appetite but for the most part in
a sort of quiescence that was neither waking nor
slumber we fell through a space of time that had

   jit is a curious thing that while we were in the sphere we felt not
the slightest desire for food nor did we feel the want of it when wa
abstained at first we forced our appetites but afterwards we fasted
completely altogether we did not consume one-hundredth part of the
compressed provisions we had brought with us the amount of car-
bonic acid we breathed out was unnaturally low but why this was so
i am quite unable to explain

neither night nor day in it silently softly and
swiftly down towards the moon

chapter vi
the landing on the moon

 remember how one day cavor suddenly
opened six of our shutters and blinded me so
that i cried aloud at him the whole area was
moon a stupendous scimitar of white dawn with
its edge hacked out by notches of darkness the
orescent shore of an ebbing tide of darkness out of
which peaks and pinnacles came climbing into the
blaze of the sun i take it the reader has seen pic-
tures or photographs of the moon so that i need
not describe the broader features of that landscape
those spacious ring-like ranges vaster than any
terrestrial mountains their summits shining in the
day their shadows harsh and deep the gray dis-
ordered plains the ridges hills and craterlets all
passing at last from a blazing illumination into a
common mystery of black athwart this world we
were flying scarcely a hundred miles above its crest
and pinnacles and now we could see what no eye
on earth will ever see that under the blaze of the
day the harsh outlines of the rocks and ravines of
the plains and crater floor grew gray and indistinct
under a thickening haze that the white of their lit
surfaces broke into lumps and patches and broke
again and shrank and vanished and that here and
there strange tints of brown and olive grew and
spread

  but little time we had for watching then for
now we had come to the real danger of our journey
we had to drop ever closer to the moon as we spun
about it to slacken our pace and watch our chance
until at last we could dare to drop upon its surface

  for cavor that was a time of intense exertion
for me it was an anxious inactivity i seemed per-
petually to be getting out of his way he leapt
about the sphere from point to point with an
agility that would have been impossible on earth
he was perpetually opening and closing the cavor-
ite windows making calculations consulting his
chronometer by means of the glow lamp during those
last eventful hours for a long time we had all our
windows closed and hung silently in darkness hurl-
ing through space

  then he was feeling for the shutter studs and
suddenly four windows were open i staggered
and covered my eyes drenched and scorched and
blinded by the unaccustomed splendour of the sun
beneath my feet then again the shutters snapped
leaving my brain spinning in a darkness that pres-
sed against the eyes and after that i floated in
another vast black silence

  then cavor switched on the electric light and
told me he proposed to bind all our luggage together
with the blankets about it against the concussion
of our descent we did this with our windows
closed because in that way our goods arranged
themselves naturally at the centre of the sphere
that too was a strange business we two men float-
ing loose in that spherical space and packing and
pulling ropes imagine it if you can no up nor
down and every effort resulting in unexpected

movements now i would be pressed against the
glass with the full force of cavors thrust now 
would be kicking helplessly in a void now the
star of the electric light would be overhead now un-
der foot now cavors feet would float up before
my eyes and now we would be crossways to each
other but at last our goods were safely bound
together in a big soft bale all except two blankets
with head holes that we were to wrap about our-
selves

  then for a flash cavor opened a window moon-
ward and we saw that we were dropping towards
a huge central crater with a number of minor
craters grouped in a sort of cross about it and
then again cavor flung our little sphere open to the
scorching blinding sun i think he was using the
suns attraction as a brake cover yourself with
a blanket he cried thrusting himself from me and
for a moment i did not understand

  then i hauled the blanket from beneath my feet
and got it about me and over my head and eyes
abruptly he closed the shutters again snapped
one open again and closed it then suddenly began
snapping them all open each safely into its steel
roller there came a jar and then we were roll-
ing over and over bumping against the glass and
against the big bale of our luggage and clutching
at each other and outside some white substance
splashed as if we were rolling down a slope of
snow   

  over clutch bump clutch bump over   

  came a thud and i was half buried under the
bale of our possessions and for a space everything
was still then i could hear cavor puffing and
grunting and the snapping of a shutter in its sash
i made an effort thrust back our blanket-wrapped
luggage and emerged from beneath it our open
windows were just visible as a deeper black set with
stars

  we were still alive and we were lying in the
darkness of the shadow of the wall of the great
crater into which we had fallen

  we sat getting our breath again and feeling the
bruises on our limbs i dont think either of us
had had a very clear expectation of such rough
handling as we had received i struggled painfully
to my feet and now said i to look at the
landscape of the moon but- its tremen-
dously dark cavor

  the glass was dewy and as i spoke i wiped at
it with my blanket were half an hour or so
beyond the day he said we must wait

  it was impossible to distinguish anything we
might have been in a sphere of steel for all that
we could see my rubbing with the blanket simply
smeared the glass and as fast as i wiped it it
became opaque again with freshly condensed mois-
ture mixed with an increasing quantity of blanket
hairs of course i ought not to have used the
blanket in my efforts to clear the glass i slipped
upon the damp surface and hurt my shin against
one of the oxygen cylinders that protruded from our
bale

  the thing was exasperating-it was absurd here
we were just arrived upon the moon amidst we
knew not what wonders and all we could see was
the first men in the moon



the gray and streaming wall of the bubble in which
we had come

  confound it i said but at this rate we might
have stopped at home and i squatted on the bale
and shivered and drew my blanket closer about
me

  abruptly the moisture turned to spangles and
fronds of frost can you reach the electric heater
said cavor yes-that black knob or we shall
freeze

  i did not wait to be told twice and now said
i what are we to do

  wait he said of course we shall have to
wait until our air gets warm again and then this
glass will clear we cant do anything till then
its night here yet we must wait for the day to
overtake us meanwhile dont you feel hungry

  for a space i did not answer him but sat fretting
i turned reluctantly from the smeared puzzle of
the glass and stared at his face yes i said i
am hungry i feel somehow enormously disap-
pointed i had expected-i dont know what i had
expected but not this

  i summoned my philosophy and rearranging my
blanket about me sat down on the bale again and
began my first meal on the moon i dont think i
finished it-i forget presently first in patches
then running rapidly together into wider spaces
came the clearing of the glass came the drawing
of the misty veil that hid the moon world from our
eyes

  wc peered out upon the landscape of the
moon

chapter vii

sunrise on the moon

as we saw it first it was the wildest and moat
desolate of scenes we were in an enormous
amphitheatre a vast circular plain the
floor of the giant crater its cliff-like walls closed
us in on every side from the westward the light
of the unseen sun fell upon them reaching to the
very foot of the cliff and showed a disordered
escarpment of drab and grayish rock lined here and
there with banks and crevices of snow this was
perhaps a dozen miles away but at first no interven-
ing atmosphere diminished in the slightest the
minutely detailed brilliancy with which these things
glared at us they stood out clear and dazzling
against a background of starry blackness that seem-
ed to our earthly eyes rather a gloriously spangled
velvet curtain than the spaciousness of the sky

  the eastward cliff was at first merely a starless
selvedge to the starry dome no rosy flush no
creeping pallor announced the commencing day
only the corona the zodiacal light a huge cone-
shaped luminous haze pointing up towards the
splendour of the morning star warned us of the
imminent nearness of the sun

  whatever light was about us was reflected by
the westward cliffs it showed a huge undulating
plain cold and gray a gray that deepened eastward
into the absolute raven darkness of the cliff shadow
innumerable rounded gray summits ghostly hum-
mocks billows of snowy substance stretching crest

beyond crest into the remote obscurity gave us our
first inkling of the distance of the crater wall
these hummocks looked like snow at the time i
thought they were snow but they were not-they
were mounds and masses of frozen air

  so it was at first and then sudden swift and
amazing came the lunar day

  the sunlight had crept down the cliff it touched
the drifted masses at its base and incontinently
came striding with seven-leagued boots towards us
the distant cliff seemed to shift and quiver and at
the touch of the dawn a reek of gray vapour poured
upward from the crater floor whirls and puffs and
drifting wraiths of gray thicker and broader and
denser until at last the whole westward plain was
steaming like a wet handkerchief held before the
fire and the westward cliffs were no more than a
refracted glare beyond

  it is air said cavor it must be air-or it
would not rise like this-at the mere touch of a
sunbeam and at this pace   

  he peered upwards look he said

  what i asked

  in the sky already on the blackness-a little
touch of blue see the stars seem larger and
tht little ones and all those dim nebulosities we saw
in empty space-they are hidden

  swiftly steadily the day approached us gray
summit after gray summit was overtaken by the
blaze and turned to a smoking white intensity at
last there was nothing to the west of us but a bank
of surging fog the tumultuous advance and ascent
of cloudy haze the distant cliff had receded
farther and farther had loomed and changed
through the whirl and foundered and vanished at
last in its confusion

  nearer came that steaming advance nearer and
nearer coming as fast as the shadow of a cloud
before the south-west wind about us rose a thin
anticipatory haze

  cavor gripped my arm

  what i said

  look the sunrise the sun

  he turned me about and pointed to the brow of
the eastward cliff looming above the haze about us
scarce lighter than the darkness of the sky but
now its line was marked by strange reddish shapes
tongues of vermilion flame that writhed and danced
i fancied it must be spirals of vapour that had
caught the light and made this crest of fiery tongues
against the sky but indeed it was the solar prom-
inences i saw a crown of fire about the sun that
is forever hidden from earthly eyes by our atmos-
pheric veil

  and then-the sun

  steadily inevitably came a brilliant line came
a thin edge of intolerable effulgence that took a
circular shape became a bow became a blazing
sceptre and hurled a shaft of heat at us as though
it was a spear

  it seemed verily to stab my eyes i cried aloud
and turned about blinded groping for my blanket
beneath the bale

  and with that incandescence came a sound the
first sound that had reached us from without since
we left the earth a hissing and rustling the stormy


amazing stories

trailing of the aerial garment of the advancing
day and with the coining of the sound and the
light the sphere lurched and blinded and dazzled
we staggered helplessly against each other it
lurched again and the hissing grew louder i had
shut my eyes perforce i was making clumsy efforts
to cover my head with my blanket and this second
lurch sent me helplessly off my feet i fell against
the bale and opening my eyes had a momentary
glimpse of the air just outside our glass it was
running-it was boiling-like snow into which a
white-hot rod is thrust what had been solid air
had suddenly at the touch of the sun become a
paste a mud a slushy liquefaction that hissed and
bubbled into gas

  there came a still more violent whirl of the sphere
and we had clutched one another in another
moment we were spun about again round we
went and over and then i was on all fours the
lunar dawn had hold of us it meant to show us
little men what the moon could do with us

  i caught a second glimpse of things without
puffs of vapour half-liquid slush excavated sliding
falling sliding we dropped into darkness i went
down with cavors knees in my chest then he
seemed to fly away from me and for a moment i
lay with all the breath out of my body staring
upward a toppling crag of the melting stifltiihu
splashed over us buried us and now it thinned and
boiled off us i saw the bubbles dancing on the
glass above i heard cavor exclaiming feebly

  then some huge landship in the thawing air had
caught us and spluttering expostulation we began
to roll down a slope rolling faster and faster leap-
ing crevasses and rebounding from banks faster and
faster westward into the white-hot boiling tumult
of the lunar day

  clutching at one another we spun about pitched
this way and that our bale of packages leaping at
us pounding at us we collided we gripped we
were torn asunder-our heads met and the whole
universe burst into fiery darts and stars on the
earth we should have smashed one another a dozen
times but on the moon luckily for us our weight
was only one-sixth of what it is terrestrially and
we fell very mercifully i recall a sensation of utter
sickness a feeling as if my brain were upside down
within my skull and then-

  something was at work upon my face some thin
feelers worried my ears then i discovered the
brilliance of the landscape around was mitigated
by blue spectacles cavor bent over me and i
saw his face upside down his eyes also protected
by tinted goggles his breath came irregularly and
his lip was bleeding from a bruise better he
said wiping the blood with the back of his hand

  everything seemed swaying for a space but that
was simply my giddiness i perceived that he had
closed some of the shutters in the outer sphere to
save me from the direct blaze of the sun i was
aware that everything about us was very brilliant

 lord i gasped but this-

  i craned my neck to see i perceived there was
a blinding glare outside an utter change from the
gloomy darkness of our first impressions have
i been insensible long i asked

  i dont know-the chronometer is broken some
little time    my dear chap i have been
afraid  

  i lay for a space taking this in i saw his face
still bore evidences of emotion for a while i said
nothing i passed an inquisitive hand over my
contusions and surveyed his face for similar
damages the back of my right hand had suffered
most and was skinless and raw my forehead was
bruised and had bled he handed me a little
measure with some of the restorative-i forget the
name of it-he had brought with us after a time
i felt a little better i began to stretch my limbs
carefully soon i could talk

  it wouldnt have done i said as though there
had been no interval

  no it wouldnt

  he thought his hands hanging over his knees
he peered through the glass and then stared at
me good lord he said no

  what has happened i asked after a pause
have we jumped to the tropics

  it was as i expected this air has evaporated-
if it is air at any rate it has evaporated and
the surface of the moon is showing we are lying
on a bank of earthy rock here and there bare
soil is exposed a queer sort of soil

  it occurred to him that it was unnecessary to
explain he assisted me into a sitting position
and i could see with my own eyes

            chapter viii
            a lunar morning

the harsh emphasis the pitiless black and
white of the scenery had altogether disap-
peared the glare of the sun had taken upon
itself a faint tinge of amber the shadows upon the
cliff of the crater wall were deeply purple to the
eastward a dark bank of fog still crouched and
sheltered from the sunrise but to the westward the
sky was blue and clear i began to realise the length
of my insensibility

  we were no longer in a void an atmosphere
had arisen about us the outline of things had
gained in character had grown acute and varied
save for a shadowed space of white substances here
and there white substance that was no longer air
but snow the arctic appearance had gone altogether
everywhere broad rusty brown spaces of bare and
tumbled earth spread to the blaze of the sun here
and there at the edge of the snowdrifts were trans-
ient little pools and eddies of water the only things
stirring in that expanse of barrenness the sun-
light inundated the upper two blinds of our sphere
and turned our climate to high summer but our feet
were still in shadow and the sphere was lying upon
a drift of snow	

  and scattered here and there upon the slope and
emphasised by little white threads of unthawed
snow upon their shady sides were shapes like
sticks dry twisted sticks of the same rusty hue
as the rock upon which they lay that caught
ones thoughts sharply sticks on a lifeless
world then as my eye grew more accustomed to
the texture of their substance i perceived that al-
the first men in the moon



most all this surface had a fibrous texture like
the carpet of brown needles one finds beneath the
shade of pine trees

    cavor i said

   yes

   it may be a dead world now-but once-

   something arrested my attention i had dis-
 covered among these needles a number of little
 round objects and it seemed to me that one of
 these had moved

    cavor i whispered

   what

    but i did not answer at once i stared incredulous
  for an instant i could not believe my eyes i gave
  an inarticulate cry i gripped his arm i pointed
  look i cried finding my tongue there
  yes and there

   his eyes followed my pointing finger eh
 he said

   how can i describe the thing i saw it is so
 petty a thing to state and yet it seemed so wonder-
 ful so pregnant with emotion i have said that
 amidst the stick-like litter were these rounded
 bodies these little oval bodies that might have
 passed as very small pebbles and now first one
 and then another had stirred had rolled over and
 cracked and down the crack of each of them show-
 ed a minute line of yellowish green thrusting out-
 ward to meet the hot encouragement of the newly-
 risen sun for a moment that was all and then
 there stirred and burst a third

    it is a seed said cavor and then i heard him
 whisper very softly life

   life and immediately it poured upon us that
 our vast journey had not been made in vain that
 we had come to no arid waste of minerals but to
 a world that lived and moved we watched in-
  tensely i remember i kept rubbing the glass be-
 fore me with my sleeve jealous of the faintest
 suspicion of mist

    the picture was clear and vivid only in the mid-
 dle of the field all about that centre the dead
 fibres and seeds were magnified and distorted by
 the curvature of the glass but we could see
 enough one after another all down the sunlit
 slope these miraculous little brown bodies burst and
 gaped apart like seed-pods like the husks of
 fruits opened eager mouths that drank in the heat
 and light pouring in a cascade from the newly-risen
 sun

   every moment more of these seed-coats ruptured
 and even as they did so the swelling pioneers over-
 flowed their rent-distended seed-cases and passed
 into the second stage of growth with a steady
 assurance a swift deliberation these amazing seeds
 thrust a rootlet downward to the ground and a queer
 little bundle-like bud into the air in a little while
 the whole slope was dotted with minute plantlets
 standing at attention in the blaze of the sun

   they did not stand for long the bundle-like
 buds swelled and strained and opened with a jerk
 thrusting out a coronet of little sharp tips spread-
 ing a whorl of tiny spiky brownish leaves that

lengthened rapidly lengthened visibly even as we
watched the movement was slower than any
animals swifter than any plants i have ever seen
before how can i suggest it to you-the way that
growth went on the leaf tips grew so that they
moved onward even while we looked at them the
brown seed-case shrivelled and was absorbed with
an equal rapidity have you ever on a cold day
taken a thermometer into your warm hand and
watched the little thread of mercury creep up the
tube these moon plants grew like that

  in a few minutes as it seemed the buds of the
more forward of these plants had lengthened into
a stem and were even putting forth a second whorl
of leaves and all the slope that had seemed so
recently a lifeless stretch of litter was now dark
with the stunted olive-green herbage of bristling
spikes that swayed with the vigour of their grow-
ing

  i turned about and behold along the upper
edge of a rock to the eastward a similar fringe in
a scarcely less forward condition swayed and bent
dark against the blinding glare of the sun and
beyond this fringe was the silhouette of a plant
mass branching clumsily like a cactus and swelling
visibly swelling like a bladder that fills with air

  then to the westward also i discovered that an-
other such distended form was rising over the
scrub but here the light fell upon its sleek sides
and i could see that its colour was a vivid orange
hue it rose as one watched it if one looked away
from it for a minute and then back its outline had
changed it thrust out blunt congested branches
until in a little time it rose a coralline shape of
many feet in height compared with such a growth
the terrestrial puff-ball which will sometimes swell
a foot in diameter in a single night would be a
hopeless laggard but than the puff-ball grows
against a gravitational pull six times that of the
moon beyond out of gullies and flats that had
been hidden from us but not from the quickening
sun over reefs and banks of shining rock a bristling
beard of spiky and fleshy vegetation was straining
into view hurrying tumultuously to take advantage
of the brief day in which it must flower and fruit
and seed again and die it was like a miracle that
growth so one must imagine the trees and plants
arose at the creation and covered the desolation of
the new-made earth

  imagine it imagine that dawn the resur-
rection of the frozen air the stirring and quicken-
ing of the soil and then this silent uprising of
vegetation this unearthly ascent of fleshiness and
spikes conceive it all lit by a blaze that would
make the intensest sunlight of earth seem watery
and weak and still around this stirring jungle
wherever there was shadow lingered banks of bluish
snow and to have the picture of our impression
complete you must bear in mind that we saw it all
through a thick bent glass distorting it as things
are distorted by a lens acute only in the centre of
the picture and very bright there and towards the
edges magnified and unreal

first real blizzard of the winter had
 phi hurst upon new york from the atlantic

          for seventy-two hours-as rentland
chief clerk in the broadway offices of
the american commodities company
saw from the record he was making for president
welter-no ship of any of the dozen expected
from foreign ports had been able to make the
companys docks in brooklyn or indeed had been
reported at sandy hook and for the last five
days during which the weather bureaus storm
signals had stayed steadily set no steamer of the
six which had finished unloading at the docks the
week before had dared to try for the open sea ex-
cept one the elizabethan age which had cleared
the narrows on monday night

  on land the storm was scarcely less disastrous to
the business of the great importing company since
tuesday morning rentlands reports of the car-
and train-load consignments which had left the
warehouses daily had been a monotonous page of
trains stalled but until that friday morning
welter-the big bull-necked thick-lipped master of
men and money-had borne all the accumulated
trouble of the week with serenity almost with con-
tempt only when the chief clerk added to his re-
port the minor item that the -ton steamer
elizabethan age which had cleared on monday
night had been driven into boston something sud-
denly seemed to break in the inner office rent-
land heard the presidents secretary telephone to
brooklyn for rowan the dock superintendent he
heard welters heavy steps going to and fro in the
private office his hoarse voice raised angrily and
soon afterwards rowan blustered in rentland
could no longer overhear the voices he went back
to his own private office and called the station
master at the grand central station on the tele-
phone

  the seven oclock train from chicago  the clerk
asked in a guarded voice

it came in at  as
expected oh at 

thank you he hung up
the receiver and opened
the door to pass a word
with rowan as he came
out of the presidents
office

  theyve wired that the
elizabethan age couldnt
get beyond boston ro-
wan he cried curiously

the---

hooker the dock super-
intendent had gone strangely white for the im-
perceptible fraction of an instant his eyes dimmed
with fear as he stared into the wondering face of
the clerk but he recovered himself quickly spat
offensively and slammed the door as he went out
rentland stood with clenching hands for a moment
then he glanced at the clock and hurried to the en-
trance of the outer office the elevator was just
bringing up from the street a red-haired blue-gray-
eyed young man of medium height who noting with
a quick intelligent glance the arrangement of the
offices advanced directly toward president welters

door the chief clerk stepped forward quickly
  you are mr trant

  yes

  i am rentland this way please he led the
psychologist to the little room behind the files
where he had telephoned the moment before

your wire to me in chicago which brought me
here said trant turning from the inscription
chief clerk on the door to the dogged decisive
features and wiry form of his client gave me to
understand that you wished to have me investigate
the disappearance or death of two of your dock
scaqe-checkers i suppose you were acting for
president welter-of whom i have heard-in send-
ing for me

  no said rentland as he waved trant to a
seat president welter is certainly not troubling
himself to that extent over an investigation
then the company or some other officer trant
questioned with increasing curiosity

  no nor the company nor any other officer in it
mr trant rentland smiled nor even am i
as chief clerk of the american commodities com-
pany overtroubling myself about those checkers
he leaned nearer to trant confidentially but as a
special agent for the united states treasury de-
partment i am extremely interested in the death of
one of these men and in the disappearance of the
other and fcr that i called you to help me

  as a secret agent for the government trant
repeated with rapidly rising interest

  yes a spy if you wish so to call me but as
truly in the ranks of the enemies to my country as
any nathan hale who has a statue in this city
to-day the enemies are the big corrupting thiev-
ing corporations like this company and appreciat-
ing that i am not ashamed to be a spy in their
ranks commissioned by the government to catch
and condemn president welter and any other offi-
cers involved with him for systematically stealing
from the government for
the past ten years and for
probable connivance in the
murder of at least one of
those two checkers so that
the company might con-
tinue to steal

 to steal how
customs frauds thefts
smuggling-anything you
wish to call it exactly
what or how i cant tell
for that is part of what
i sent for you to find
out for a number of
years the customs department has suspected
upon circumstantial evidence that the enormous
profits of this company upon the thousand and
one things which it is importing and distributing
must come in part from goods they have got
through without paying the proper duty so at
my own suggestion i entered the employ of the
company a year ago to get track of the method
but after a year here i was almost ready to give
up the investigation in despair when ed landers
the companys checker on the docks in scale house
no  was killed-accidentally the coroners jury

 this excellent detective scientifiction story is the
 first of a series to appear in amazing stories
 these romances dcpict the achievement of luther trant
 psychological detective

   while the results of psychic evidence have not as yet been

amazing stories

said to me it looked suspiciously like murder
within two weeks morse who was appointed as
checker in his place suddenly disappeared the
companys officials showed no concern as to the fate
of these two men and my suspicions that some-
thing crooked might be going on at scale house no
 were strengthened and i sent for you to help me
to get at the bottom of things

  is it not best then to begin by giving me as
fully as possible the details of the employment of
morse and landers and also of their disappear-
ance the young psychologist suggested

  i have told you these things here trant rather
than take you to some safer place the secret agent
replied because i have been waiting for some one
who can tell you what you need to know better than
i can edith rowan the stepdaughter of the dock
superintendent knew landers well for he boarded
at rowans house she was-or is if he still lives
-engaged to morse it is an unusual thing for
rowan himself to come here to see president wel-
ter as he did just before you came but every morn-
ing since morse disappeared his daughter has come
to see welter personally she is already waiting in
the outer office opening the door he indicated
to trant a light-haired overdressed nervous girl
twisting about uneasily on the seat outside the
presidents private office

  welter thinks it policy for some reason to see
her a moment every morning but she always
comes out almost at once-crying

  this is interesting trant commented as he
watched the girl go into the presidents office after
only a moment she came out crying rentland had
already left his room so it seemed by chance that
he and trant met and supported her to the elevator
and over the slippery pavement to a neat electric
coup which was standing at the curb

  its hers said rentland as trant hesitated be-
fore helping the girl into it its one of the things
i wanted you to see broadway is very slippery
miss rowan you will let me see you home again
this morning this gentleman is mr trant a pri-
vate detective i want him to come along with
us

  the girl acquiesced and trant crowded into the
little automobile rentland turned the coupe skill-
fully out into the swept path of the street ran
swiftly down fifth avenue to fourteenth street
and stopped three streets to the east before a house
in the middle of the block the house was as nar-
row and cramped and as cheaply constructed as its
neighbors on both sides it had lace curtains con-
spicuous in every window and with impressive
statuettes vases and gaudy bits of bric-a-brac in
the front rooms

  he told me again that will must still be off
drunk and will never takes a drink she spoke to
them for the first time as they entered the little
sitting room

  he is welter rentland explained to trant
 will is morse the missing man now miss
rowan i have brought mrtrant with me because
i have asked him to help me find morse for you as
i promised and i want you to tell him everything
you can about how landers was killed and how
morse disappeared

  and remember trant interposed that i know

very little about the american commodities com-
pany

  why mr trant the girl gathered herself to-
gether you cannot help knowing something about
the company it imports almost everything-
tobacco sugar coffee olives and preserved fruits
oils and all sorts of table delicacies from all over
the world even from borneo mr trant and from
madagascar and new zealand it has big ware-
houses at the docks with millions of dollars worth
of goods stored in them my stepfather has been
with the company for years and has charge of all
that goes on at the docks

  including the weighing

  yes everything on which there is a duty when
it is taken off the boats has to be weighed and to
do this there are big scales and for each one a scale
house when a scale is being used there are two
men in the scale house one of these is the govern-
ment weigher who sets the scale to a balance and
notes down the weight in a book the other man
who is an employee of the company writes the
weight also in a book of his own and he is called
the companys checker but though there are half
a dozen scales almost everything when it is pos-
sible is unloaded in front of scale no  for that
is the best berth for ships

  and landers

  landers was the companys checker on scale no
 well about five weeks ago i began to see that
mr landers was troubled about something twice
a queer quiet little man with a scar on his cheek
came to see him and each time they went up to mr
landers room and talked a long while eds room
was over the sitting room and after the man had
gone i could hear him walking back and forth-
walking and walking until it seemed as though he
would never stop i told father about this man
who troubled mr landers and he asked him about
it but mr landers flew into a rage and said it was
nothing of importance then one night-it was a
wednesday-everybody stayed late at the docks
to finish unloading the steamer covallo about two
oclock father got home but mr landers had not
been ready to come with him he did not come all
that night and the next day he did not come home

  now mr trant they are very careful at the
warehouses about who goes in and out because so
many valuable things are stored there on one side
the warehouses open on the docks and at each end
they are fenced off so that you cannot go along the
docks and get away from them that way and on the
other side they open on the street through great
driveway doors and at every door as long as it
is open there stands a watchman who sees every-
body that goes in and out only one door was open
that wednesday night and the watchman there had
not seen mr landers go out and the second night
passed and he did not come home but the next
morning friday morning the girl caught her
breath hysterically mr landers body was found
in the engine room back of scale house no  with
the face crushed in horribly

  was the engine room occupied said trant
quickly it must have been occupied in the day-
time and probably on the night when landers dis-
appeared as they were unloading the cavdlo but
the man higher up



on the night after which the body was found-was
it occupied that night 

  i dont know mr trant i think it could not
have been for after the verdict of the coroners
jury which was that mr landers had been killed
by some part of the machinery it was said that
the accident must have happened either the eve-
ning before just bfore the engineer shut off his
engines or the first thing that morning just after
he had started them for otherwise somebody in the
engine room would have seen it

  but where had landers been all day thursday
miss rowan from two oclock on the second night
before when your father last saw him until the
accident in the engine room

  it was supposed he had been drunk when his
body was found his clothes were covered with
fibers from the coffee-sacking and the jury sup-
posed he had been sleeping off his liquor in the
coffee warehouse during thursday but i had
known ed landers for almost three years and in
all that time i never knew him to take even one
drink

  then it was a very unlikely supposition you
do not believe in that accident miss rowan  trant
said brusquely

  the girl grew white as paper oh mr trant
i dont know i did believe in it but since will
-mi morse-has disappeared in exactly the same
way under exactly the same circumstances and
everyone acts about it exactly the same way-

  you say the circumstances of morses disap-
pearance were the same trant pressed quietly
when she was able to proceed

  after mr landers had been found dead said
the girl pulling herself together again mr morse
who had been checker in one of the other scale
houses was made checker on scale no  we were
surprised at that for it was a sort of promotion and
father did not like will he had been greatly dis-
pleased at our engagement wills promotion made
us very happy for it seemed as though father must
be changing his opinion but after will had been
checker on scale no  only a few days the same
queer quiet little man with the scar on his cheek
who had begun coming to see mr landers before
he was killed began coming to see will too and
after he began coming will was troubled terribly
troubled i could see but he would not tell me the
reason and he expected after that man began
coming that something would happen to him and
i know from the way he acted and spoke about mr
landers that he thought he had not been accident-
ally killed one evening when i could see he had
been more troubled than ever before he said that
if anything happened to him i was to go at once to
his boarding house and take charge of everything in
his room and not to let anyone into the room to
search it until i had removed everything in the
bureau drawers everything no matter how
useless anything seemed then the very next
night five days ago just as while mr landers was
checker everybody stayed overtime at the docks to
finish unloading a vessel the elizabethan age and
in the morning wills landlady called me on the
phone to tell me that hehad not come home five
days ago mr trant and since then no one has
seen or heard from him and the watchman did not

see him come out of the warehouse that night just
as he did not see ed landers

  what did you find in morses bureau asked
trant

  i found nothing

  nothing trant repeated that is impos-
sible miss rowan think again remember he
warned you that what you found might seem trivial
and useless

  the girl a little defiantly studied for an instant
trants clear-cut features suddenly she arose and
ran from the room but returned quickly with a
strange little implement in her hand

  it was merely a bit of wire straight for perhaps
three inches and then bent in a half circle of five
or six inches the bent portion of the wire being
wound carefully with stout twine thus

the mysterious string-wrapped piece of bent wire

  except for his clothes and some blank writing
paper and envelopes that was absolutely the only
thing in the bureau it was the only thing at all
in the only locked drawer

  trant and rentland stared disappointedly at this
strange implement which the girl handed to the
psychologist

  you have shown this to your stepfather miss
rowan for a possible explanation of why a com-
pany checker should be so solicitous about such a
thing as this asked trant

  no the girl hesitated will had told me not
to say anything and i told you father did not like
will he had made up his mind that i was to
marry ed landers in most ways father is kind
and generous hes kept the coupe we came here in
for mother and me for two years and you see
she gestured a little proudly about the bedecked and
badly furnished rooms you see how he gets every-
thing for us mr landers was most generous too
he took me to the theaters two or three times every
week-always the best seats too i didnt want to
go but father made me i preferred will though
he wasnt so generous

  trants eyes returned with more intelligent scru-
tiny to the mysterious implement in his hand

  what salary do checkers receive rentland he
asked in a low tone

  one hundred and twenty-five dollars a month
and her father the dock superintendent-how
much trants expressive glance now jumping
about from one gaudy extravagant trifle in the
room to another caught a glimpse again of the elec-
tric coupe standing in the street then returned to
the tiny bit of wire in his hand

  three thousand a year rentland replied

  tell me miss rowan said trant this imple-
ment-have you by any chance mentioned it to
president welter

  why no mr trant

  you are sure of that excellent excellent
now the queer quiet little man with the scar on his
cheek who came to see morse no one could tell you
anything about him


amazing stories

  no one mr trant but yesterday wills land-
lady told me that a man has come to ask for will
every forenoon since he disappeared and she thinks
this may be the man with the scar though she
cant be sure for he kept the collar of his overcoat
up about his face she was to telephone me if he
came again

  if he comes this morning trant glanced
quickly at his watch you and i rentland might
much better be waiting for him over there

  the psychologist rose putting the bent twine-
wound bit of wire carefully into his pocket and a
minute later the two men crossed the street to the
house already known to rentland where morse had
boarded the landlady not only allowed them to
wait in her little parlor but waited with them un-
til at the end of an hour she pointed with an eager
gesture to a short man in a big ulster who turned
sharply up the front steps

  thats him-see she exclaimed

  that the man with the scarl cried rentland
well i know him

  he made for the door caught at the ulster and
pulled the little man into the house by main force

  well dickey the secret agent challenged as
the man faced him in startled recognition what
are you doing in this case trant this i inspec-
tor dickey of the customs office he introduced
the officer

im in the case on my own hook if i know what
case youre talking about piped dickey morse
eh and the american commodities company eh
exactly said rentland brusquely what were
you calling to see landers for

  you know about that the little man looked
up sharply well six weeks ago landers came
to me and told me he had something to sell a secret
system for beating the customs but before we got
to terms he began losing his nerve a little he got
it back however and was going to tell me when all
at once he disappeared and two days later he was
dead that made it hotter for me so i went after
morse but morse denied he knew anything then
morse disappeared too

  so you got nothing at all out of them rent-
land interposed

  nothing i could use landers one time when he
was getting up his nerve showed me a piece of bent
wire-with string around it-in his room and be-
gan telling me something when rowan called him
and then he shut up

  a bent wire trant cried eagerly lake this
he took from his pocket the implement given him
by edith rowan morse had this in his room the
only thing in a locked drawer

  the same thing dickey cried seizing it so
morse had it too after he became checker at scale
no  where the cheating is if anywhere the
very thing landers started to explain to me and
how they cheated the customs with it i say we
must have it now rentland we need only go
to the docks and watch them while they weigh and
see how they use it and arrest them and then we
have them at last eh old man he cried in triumph
we have them at last

  you mean trant cut in upon the customs man
that you can convict and jail perhaps the checker
or a foreman or maybe even a dock superintendent

-as usual but the men higher up-the big men
who are really at the bottom of this business and
the only ones worth getting-will you catch them 

  we must take those we can get said dickey
sharply

  trant laid his hand on the little officers arm

  i am a stranger to you he said but if you
have followed some of the latest criminal cases in
illinois perhaps you know that using the methods
of modern practical psychology i have been able to
get results where old way have failed we are
front to front now with perhaps the greatest prob-
lem of modern criminal catching to catch in cases
involving a great corporation not only the little
men low down who perform the criminal acts but
the men higher up who conceive or connive at the
criminal scheme rentland i did not come here to
convict merely a dock foreman but if we are
going to reach anyone higher than that you must
not let inspector dickey excite suspicion by prying
into matters at the docks this afternoon

  but what else can we do said rentland doubt-
fully

  modern practical psychology gives a dozen pos-
sible ways for proving the knowledge of the man
higher up in this corporation crime trant an-
swered and i am considering which is the most
practicable only tell me he demanded suddenly
mr welter i have heard is one of the rich men of
new york who make it a fad to give largely to
universities and other institutions can you tell
me with what ones he may be most closely in-
terested

  i have heard rentland replied that he is one
of the patrons of the stuyvesant school of science
it i probably the most fashionably patroned insti-
tution in new york and welters name i know
figures with it in the newspapers

  nothing could be better trant exclaimed
kuno schmalz has his psychological laboratory
there i see my way now rentland and you will
hear from me early in the afternoon but keep
away from the docks he turned and left the
astonished customs officers abruptly half an hour
later the young psychologist sent in his card to pro-
fessor schmalz in the laboratory of the stuyvesant
school of science the german broad-faced spec-
tacled beaming himself came to the laboratory
door

  is it mr trant-the young apt pupil of my old
friend dr reiland  he boomed admiringly ach
luck is good to reiland for twenty years i too
have shown them in the laboratory how fear guilt
every emotion causes in the body reactions which
can be measured but do they apply it pouf
no it remains to them all impractical academic
because i have only nincompoops in my classes

  professor schmalz said trant following him
into the laboratory and glancing from one to
another of the delicate instruments with keen in-
terest tell me along what line you are now
working

  ach i have been for a year now experimenting
with the plethysmograph and the pneumograph i
make a taste i make a smell or i make a noise to
excite feeling in the subject and i read by the
plethysmograph that the volume of blood in the
hand decreases under the emotions and that the
the man higher up



pulse quickens and by the pneumograph i read that
the breathing is easier or quicker depending on
whether the emotions are pleasant or unpleasant i
have performed this year more than two thousand
of those experiments

  good i have a problem in which you can be of
the very greatest use to me and the plethysmo-
graph and the pneumograph will serve my purpose
as well as any other instruments in the laboratory
for no matter how hardened a man may be no
matter how impossible it may have become to de-
tect his feelings in his face or bearing he cannot
prevent the volume of blood in his hand from de-
creasing and his breathing from becoming dif-
ferent under the influence of emotions of fear or
guilt by the way professor is mr welter familiar
with these experiments of yours

  what he cried the stout german for why
should i tell him about them he knows nothing
he has bought my time to instruct classes he has
not bought py chiminey everything-even the soul
gott gave me

  but he would be interested in them

  to be sure he would be interested in them he
would bring in his automobile three or four other
fat money-makers and he would show off before
them he would make his trained bear-that is me
-danie

  good cried trant again excitedly professor
schmalz would you be willing to give a little exhi-
bition of the plethysmograph and pneumograph thi
evening if possible and arrange for president wel-
ter to attend it

  the astute german cast on him a quick glance
of interrogation why not he said it makes
nothing to me what purpose you will be carrying
out no py chiminey not if it costs me my posi-
tion of trained bear because i have confidence in
my psychology that it will not make any innocent
man suffer

  and you will have two or three scientists present
to watch the experiments and you will allow mo
to be there also and assist

  with great pleasure

  but professor schmalz you need not intro-
duce me to mr welter who will think i am one
of your assistants

  as you wish about that pupil of my dear old
friend

  excellent trant leaped to his feet pro-
vided it is possible to arrange this with mr welter
how soon can you let me know

  ach it is as good as arranged i tell you his
vanity will arrange it if i assure the greatest

publicity-

  the more publicity the better

wait it shall be fixed before you leave here
the professor led the way into his private study
telephoned to the president of the american com-
modities company and made the appointment with-
out trouble

  a few minutes before eight oclock that evening
trant again mounted rapidly the stone steps to the
professors laboratory the professor and two
others who were bending over a table in the cen-
ter of the room turned at his entrance president
welter had not yet arrived the young psycholo-

gist acknowledged with pleasure the introduction to
the two scientists with schmalz both of them were
known to him by name and he had been following
with interest a series of experiments whieh the
elder dr annerly had been reporting in a psycho-
logical journal then he turned at once to the
apparatus on the table

  he was still examining the instruments when the
noise of a motor car stopping at the door warned
him of the arrival of president welters party
then the laboratory door opened and the party
appeared they also were three in number stout
men rather obtrusively dressed in jovial spirits
with strong faces flushed now with the wine they
had taken at dinner

  well professor what fireworks are you going
to show us to-night asked welter patronizingly
schmalz he explained to his companions is the
chief ringmaster of this circus

  the bearded face of the german grew purple un-
der welters jokingly overbearing manner but he
turned to the instruments and began to explain
them the pneumograph which the professor first
took up consists of a very thin flexible brass plate
suspended by a cord around the neck of the person
under examination and fastened tightly against
the chest by a cord circling the body on the outer
surface of this plate are two small bent levers
connected at one end to the cord around the body of
the subject and at the other end to the surface
of a small hollow drum fastened to the plate be-
tween the two as the chest rises and falls in
breathing the levers press more and less upon the
surface of the drum and this varying pressure
on the air inside the drum is transmitted from the
drum through an air-tight tube to a little pencil
which it lowers and raises the pencil as it rises
and falls touching always a sheet of smoked paper
traveling over a cylinder on the recording device
traces a line whose rising strokes represent accu-
rately the drawing of air into the chest and whose
falling represents its expulsion

  it was clear to trant that the professors rapid
explanation though plain enough to the psycholo-
gists already familiar with the device was only
partly understood by the big men it had not been
explained to them that changes in the breathing so
slight as to be imperceptible to the eye would be
recorded unmistakably by the moving pencil

  professor schmalz turned to the second instru-
ment this was a plethysmograph designed to
measure the increase or decrease of the size of one
finger of a person under examination as the blood
supply to that finger becomes greater or less it con-
sists primarily of a small cylinder so constructed
that it can be fitted over the finger and made air-
tight increase or decrease of the size of the finger
then increases or decreases the air pressure inside
the cylinder these changes in the air pressure are
transmitted through an airtight tube to a delicate
piston which moves a pencil and makes a line upon
the record sheet just under that made by the
pneumograph the upward or downward trend of
this line shows the increase or decrease of the blood
supply while the smaller vibrations up and down
record the pulse beat in the finger

  there is still a thirdpencil touching tha record


amazing stories

sheet above the other two and wired electrically to
a key like that of a telegraph instrument fastened
to the table when this key is in its normal position
this pencil makes simply a straight line upon the
sheet but instantly when the key is pressed down
the line breaks downward also

  this third instrument is used merely to record
on the sheet by the change in the line the point at
which the object that arouses sensation or emotion
is displayed to the person undergoing examination

  the instants silence which followed schmalzs
rapid explanation was broken by one of welters
companions with the query

  well whats the use of all this stuff any way
ach said schmalz bluntly it is interesting
curious i will show you

  will one of you gentlemen said trant quickly
permit us to make use of him in the demonstra-
tion

  try it jim welter laughed noisily

  not i said the other this is your circus
yes indeed its mine and im not afraid of it
schmalz do your worst he dropped laughing
into the chair the professor set for him and at
schmalzs direction unbuttoned his vest the pro-
fessor hung the pneumograph around his neck and
fastened it tightly about the big chest he laid wel-
ters forearm in a rest suspended from the ceiling
and attached the cylinder to the second finger of the
plump hand in the meantime trant had quickly
set the pencils to bear upon the record sheet and
had started the cylinder on which the sheet traveled
under them

  you see i have prepared for you schmalz
lifted a napkin from a tray holding several little
dishes he took from one of these a bit of caviar
andlaid it upon welters tongue at the same in-
stant trant pushed down the key the pencils
showed a slight commotion and the spectators
stared at this record sheet

  ach exclaimed schmalz you do not like
caviar

how do you know that demanded welter
the instruments show that at the unpleasant
taste you breathe less freely-not so deep your
finger as under strong sensation or emotions grows
smaller and your pulse beats more rapidly

  by the lord welter what do you think of
that cried one of his companions your finger
gets smaller when you taste caviar

  it was a joke to them boisterously laughing
they tried welter with other food upon the tray
they lighted for him one of the black cigars of
which he was most fond and watched the trembling
pencils write the record of his pleasure at the taste
and smell through it all trant waited alert
watchful biding the time to carry out his plan it
came when having exhausted the articles at hand
they paused to find some other means to carry on
the amusement the young psychologist leaned for-
ward suddenly

  it is no great ordeal after all is it mr welter
he said modern psychology does not put its sub-
jects to torture like-he halted meaningly - a
prisoner in the elizabethan age

  dr annerly bending over the record sheet
uttered a startled exclamation trant glancing
keenly at him straightened triumphantly but the
young psychologist did not pause he took quickly
from his pocket a photograph showing merely a
heap of empty coffee sacks piled carelessly to a
height of some two feet along the inner wall of a
shed and laid it in front of the subject welters
face did not alter but again the pencils shuddered
over the moving paper and the watchers stared
with astonishment rapidly removing the photo-
graph trant substituted for it the bent wire given
him by miss rowan then for the last time he
swung to the instrument and as his eyes caught
the wildly vibrating pencils they flared with
triumph

  president welter rose abruptly but not too hur-
riedly thats about enough of this tomfoolery
he said with perfect self-possession

  his jaw had imperceptibly squared to the watch-
ful determination of the prize fighter driven into his
corner his cheek still held the ruddy glow of
health but the wine flush had disappeared from it
and he was perfectly sober

  trant tore the strip of paper from the instrument
and numbered the last three reactions    this
is the way the records looked

yvvvvvmmyvy

record of the reaction when trant said a
 prisoner in the elizabethan age i  

frcord vtade nihen welter saw the photograph of
 a heap of cojjee sacks

  amazing said dr annerly mr welter i
am curious to know what associations you have with
that photograph and bent wire the sight of which
aroused in you such strong emotion

  by immense self-control the president of the
 the man higher up



american commodities company met his eyes
fairly none he answered

  impossible no psychologist knowing how this
record was taken could look at it without feeling
absolutely certain that the photograph and spring
caused in you such excessive emotion that i am
tempted to give it without further words the name
of intense fright but if we have inadvertently
surprised a secret we have no desire to pry into it
further is it not so mr trant

  at the name president welter whirled suddenly
trant is your name trant he demanded
well ive heard of you his eyes hardened a
man like you goes just so far and then-somebody
stops him

  as they stopped landers trant inquired
come weve seen enough i guess said presi-
dent welter and including for one instant in his
now frankly menacing gaze both trant and profes-
sor schmalz turned to the door closely followed by
his companions and a moment later the quick ex-
plosions of his automobile were heard at the
sound trant seized suddenly a large envelope
dropped into it the photograph and wire he had
just used sealed signed and dated it signed and
dated also the record from the instruments and
hurriedly handed all to dr annerly

  doctor i trust this to you he cried excitedly
it will be best to have them attested by all three
of you if possible get the record photographed
to-night and distribute the photographs in safe
places above all do not let the record itself out
of your hands until i come for it it is important
-extremely important as for me i have not a
moment to lose

  he seized his hat and dashed from the room
leaving them in an astonished group

  the young psychologist sped down the stone
steps of the laboratory three at a time ran at top
speed to the nearest street corner turned it and
leaped into a waiting taxicab the american com-
modities companys dock in brooklyn he shouted
and never mind the speed limits

  rentland and the chauffeur awaiting him in the
machine galvanized at his coming

  hot work the customs agent asked

  it may be very hot but we have the start of
him trant replied as the car shot ahead welter
himself is coming to the docks to-night i think by
the look of him he left just before me but must
drop his friends first he suspects now that we
know but he cannot be aware that we know that
they are unloading to-night he probably counts on
our waiting to catch them at the cheating to-mor-
row morning so hes going over to-night himself
if i size him up right to order it stopped and re-
move all traces before we can prove anything is
dickey waiting

  when you give the word he is to take us in and
catch them at it if welter himself comes as you
think it will not change the plan rentland asked

  not at all said trant for i have him already
he will deny everything of course but its too late
now

  the big ear with unchecked speed swung down
broadway slowed after a twenty-minutes-run to

cross the brooklyn bridge and turning to the left
plunged once more at high speed into the nar-
rower and less well-kept thoroughfares of the
brooklyn water front two minutes later it over-
took a little electric coupe bobbing excitedly down
the sloping street as they passed it trant caught
sight of the illuminated number hanging at its rear
and shouted suddenly to the chauffeur who brought
his car to a stop a hundred feet beyond the psy-
chologist leaping down ran into the road before
the little car

  miss rowan he cried to its single occupant as
it came to a stop why are you coming over here
at this time to-night

  oh its you mr trant she opened the door
showing relief in the recognition oh im so
worried im on my way to see father for a tele-
gram just came to him from boston mother opened
it and told me to take it to him at once as it was
most important she wouldnt tell me what it was
about but it excited her a great deal oh im so
afraid it must be about will and that was why she
wouldnt tell me

  from boston trant pressed quickly having
her confidence the girl nervously read the tele-
gram aloud by the light of the coups side lamps
it read

  police have taken your friend out of our hands
look out for trouble wilson

  who is wilson trant demanded

  i am not sure it is the man but the captain of
the elizabethan age is a friend of fathers named
wilson

  i cant help you then after all said trant
springing back to his powerful car he whispered
a word to the chauffeur which sent it driving ahead
through the drifts at double its former speed leav-
ing the little electric coupe far behind ten minutes
later rentland stopped the motor a block short of
a great lighted doorway which suddenly showed in
a length of dark lowering buildings which lay be-
side the american commodities companys brook-
lyn docks

  now the secret agent volunteered it is up to
me to find dickeys ladder

  he guided trant down a narrow dark court
which brought them face to face with a blank wall
against this wall a light ladder had been recently
placed ascending it they came into the dock in-
closure descending again by a dozen rickety dis-
used steps they reached a darker covered team-
way and hurried along it to the docks just short
of the end of the open dock houses where a string
of arc lamps threw their white and flickering light
upon the huge black side of a moored steamer
rentland turned into a little shed and the two came
suddenly upon customs officer dickey

  this one next to us the little man whispered
eagerly to trant as he grasped his hand is the
scale house where whatever is being done is dons-
no 

  in and out of the yawning gangways of the
steamer before them struggling lines of sweating
men were wheeling trucks loaded with bales of to-
bacco trant looked first to the left where the bales
disappeared into the tobacco warehouse then to
the right where close at hand each truck-load


amazing stories

stopped momentarily on a scale platform in front
of the low shed which bore the number dickey indi-
cated in a large white figure

  whos that asked trant as a small figure
hardly five feet tall cadaverous beetle-browed with
cold malignant red-lidded eyes passed directly un-
der the arc light nearest them

  rowan the dock superintendent dickey whis-
pered

  i knew he was small trent returned with sur-
prise but i thought surely he must have some fist
to be the terror of these dock laborers

  wait rentland behind them motioned

  a bloated menacing figure had suddenly swung
clear of the group of dock laborers-a roustabout
goaded to desperation with a fist raised against his
puny superior but before the blow had fallen an-
other fist huge and black struck the man over
rowans shoulder with a hammer he fell and
the dock superintendent passed on without a back-
ward glance the giant negro who had struck the
blow following in his footsteps like a dog

  the black rentland explained is rowans
bodyguard he needs him

  i see trant replied and for miss rowans
sake i am glad it was that way he added enig-
matically

  dickey had quietly opened a door on the opposite
side of the shed the three slipped quickly through
it and stepped unobserved around the corner of the
coffee warehouse to a long dark and narrow space
on one side of them was the rear wall of scale
house no  and on the other the engine room
where landers body had been found the single
window in the rear of no  scale house had been
whitewashed to prevent anyone from looking in
from that side but in spots the whitewash had
fallen off in flakes trant put his eye to one of
these clear spots in the glass and looked in

  the scale table supported on heavy posts ex-
tended across almost the whole front of the house
behind a low wide window which permitted those
seated at the table to see all that occurred on the
docks toward the right end of the table sat the
government weigher toward the left end and
separated from him by almost the whole length
of the table sat the company checker they
were the only persons in the scale house trant
after his first rapid survey of the scene fixed his
eye upon the man who had taken the place which
landers had held for three years and morse for
a few days afterwards-the company checker a
truck-load of tobacco bales was wheeled on to the
scales in front of the house

  watch his left knee trant whispered quick-
ly into dickeys ear at the pane beside him as the
balance was being made upon the beam before
them as he spoke the government weigher ad-
justed the balance and they saw the left leg of the
company checker pressed hard against the post
which protected the scale rod at his end both
men in the scale house then read aloud the weight
and each entered it in the book on the table in front
of him a second truckful was wheeled on to the
scale and again just as the government weigher
fixed his balances the company checker so incon-
spicuously as to make the act undiscoverable by
for fhnt tirprjsp ttinf rrtilpd

the operation with the next truck they saw it
again the psychologist turned to the others
rentland too had been watching through the pane
and nodded his satisfaction

  immediately trant dashed open the door of the
scale house and threw himself bodily upon the
checker the man resisted they struggled while
the customs men protected him trant wrenching
something from the post beside the checkers left
knee rose with a cry of triumph then the psycho-
logist warned by a cry from rentland leaped
quickly to one side to avoid a blow from the giant
negro his quickness saved him still the blow
glancing along his cheek hurled him from his feet
he rose immediately blood flowing from a super-
ficial cut upon his forehead where it had struck the
scale-house wall he saw rentland covering the
negro with a revolver and the two other customs
men arresting at pistol point the malignant little
dock superintendent the checker and the others
who had crowded into the scale house

  you see trant exhibited to the customs offi-
cers a bit of bent wire wound with string precisely
like that the girl had given him that morning and
he had used in his test of welter the hour before
it was almost exactly as we knew it must be i this
spring was stuck through a hole in the protecting
post so that it prevented the balance beam from ris-
ing properly when bales were put on the platform
a little pressure just at that point takes many
pounds from each bale weighed the checker had
only to move his knee in a way we would never
have noticed if we vre not watching for it to
work the scheme by which they have been cheating
for ten years but the rest of this affair he
glanced at the quickly collecting crowd can best
be settled in the office

  he led the way the customs men taking their
prisoners at pistol point as they entered the office
rowan first a girls cry and the answering oath of
her step-father told that the dock superinten-
dents daughter had arrived but she had been al-
most overtaken by another powerful car for be-
fore trant could speak with her the outer door of
the office opened violently and president welter in
an automobile coat and cap entered

  ah mr welter you got here quickly said
trant meeting calmly his outraged astonishment
at the scene but a little too late

  what is the matter here welter governed
his voice commandingly and what has brought
you here from your phrenology he demanded
contemptuously of trant

  the hope of catching red-handed as we have just
caught them your company checker and your dock
superintendent defrauding the government trant
returned before you could get here to stop them
and remove evidences

  what raving idiocy is this welter replied
still with excellent moderation i came here to
sign some necessary papers for ships clearing and
you-

i say we have caught your men redhanded
trant repeated at the methods used with your
certain knowledge and under your direction mr
welter to steal systematically from the united
omtemmptit for-probably the last ten years
the man higher up



we have uncovered the means by which your com-
pany checker at scale no  which because of its
position probably weighs more cargoes than all
the other scales together has been lessening the
apparent weights upon which you pay duties

  cheating here under my direction welter now
bellowed indignantly what are you talking
about rowan what is he talking about he
demanded boldly of the dock superintendent but
the cadaverous little man was unable to brazen it
out with him

  you need not have looked at your dock super-
intendent just then mr welter to see if he would
stand the racket when the trouble comes for which
you have been paying him enough on the side to keep
him in electric motors and marble statuettes and
you cannot try now to disown this crime with the
regular president-of-corporation excuse mr wel-
ter that you never knew of it that it was all done
without your knowledge by a subordinate to make
a showing in his department and do not expect
either to escape so easily your certain complicity in
the murder of landers to prevent him from expos-
ing your scheme and since-even the american
commodities company scarcely dared to have two
accidental deaths of checkers in the same month-
the shanghaiing of morse later

  my complicity in the death of landers and the
disappearance of morse welter roared

  i said the murder of landers trant corrected
for when rentland and dickey tell to-morrow be-
fore the grand jury how landers was about to dis-
close to the customs department the secret of the
cheating in weights how he was made afraid by
rowan and later was about to tell anyway and was
prevented only by a most sudden death i think
murder will be the word brought in the indictment
and i said shanghaiing of morse mr welter when
we remembered this morning that morse had dis-
appeared the night the elizabethan age left your
docks and you and rowan were so intensely dis-
gusted at its having had to put into boston this
morning instead of going on straight to sumatra
we did not have to wait for the chance information
this evening that captain wilson is a friend of
rowans to deduce that the missing checker was
put aboard as confirmed by the boston harbor
police this afternoon who searched the ship under
our instructions trant paused a moment again
fixed the now trembling welter with his eye and
continued i charge your certain complicity in
these crimes along with your certain part in the
customs frauds the psychologist repeated un-
doubtedly it was rowan who put morse out of the
way upon the elizabethan age nevertheless you
knew that he was a prisoner upon that ship a fact
which was written down in indelible black and
white by my tests of you at the stuyvesant institute
two hours ago when i merely mentioned to you
a prisoner in the elizabethan age

  i do not charge that you personally were the
one who murdered landers or even that rowan
himself did whether his negro did as i suspect
is a matter now for the courts to decide upon but
that you undoubtedly were aware that he was not
killed accidentally in the engine room but was
killed the wednesday night before and his body hid-

den under the coffee bags as i guessed from the
fibres of coffee sacking on his clothes was also
registered as mercilessly by the psychological ma-
chines when i showed you merely the picture of a
pile of coffee sacks

  and last mr welter you deny knowledge of
the cheating which has been going on and was at
the bottom of the other crimes well welter the
psychologist took from his pocket the bent twine-
wound wire here is the innocent little thing
which was the third means of causing you to regis-
ter upon the machines such extreme and inexplicable
emotion or rather mr welter it is the companion
piece to that for this is not the one i showed you
the one given to morse to use which however he
refused to make use of but it is the very wire i
took to-night from the hole in the post where it
bore against the balance beam-rod to cheat the
government when this is made public to-morrow
and with it is made public too and attested by the
scientific men who witnessed them the diagram
and explanation of the tests of you two hours ago
do you think that you can deny longer that this was
all with your knowledge and direction 

  the big bull neck of the president swelled and
his hands clenched and reclenched as he stared with
gleaming eyes into the face of the young man who
thus challenged him

  you are thinking now i suppose mr welter
trant replied to his glare that such evidence as
that directly against you cannot be got before a
court i am not so sure of that but at least it can
go before the public to-morrow morning in the
papers attested by the signatures of the scientific
men who witnessed the test it has been photo-
graphed by this time and the photographic copies
are distributed in safe places to be produced with
the original on the day when the government brings
criminal proceedings against you if i had it here
i would show you how complete how merciless is
the evidence that you knew what was being done
i would show you how at the point marked  on the
record your pulse and breathing quickened with
alarm under my suggestion how at the point
marked  your anxiety and fear increased and how
at  when the spring by which this cheating had
been carried out was before your eyes you betrayed
yourself uncontrollably unmistakably how the
volume of blood in your second finger suddenly
diminished as the current was thrown back upon
your heart how your pulse throbbed with terror
how though unmoved to outward appearance you
caught your breath and your laboring lungs strug-
gled under the dread that your wrong doing was
discovered and you would be branded-as i trust
you will now be branded mr welter when the
evidence in this case and the testimony of those
who witnessed my test are produced before a jury
-a deliberate and scheming thief

 --you the three words escaped from

welters puffed lips he put out his arm to push
aside the customs officer standing between him and
the door dickey resisted

  let him go if he wants to trant called to
the officer he can neither escape nor hide his
money holds him under bond

amilton fish errell or fish errell
as he was known at yale contemplated
the product of his genius with elation
not unmixed with awe

 the machine stood on a solid block of
transparent glass and resembled somewhat a mod-
ern radio cabinet combined with a motion picture
machine across the face of the cabinet were three
dials but here the resemblance to radio reception
ceased for these dials bore the legends longitude
latitude and altitude respectively a fourth
dial perhaps eight inches in diameter was located
above the others and this one bore the inscription
time-space

  within was a bewildering array of tubes wires
and lamps and in front of all these a curious ar-
rangement of revolving mirrors the speed of which
was controlled by a knob at the right of the cab-
inet one pair of wires connected the cabinet with
a small dynamo while a second set led to a -foot
aerial pole outside the house itself

  it was while in his senior year at yale that er-
rells researches into the strange relationship exist-
ing between light and electricity attracted so much
attention indeed he was in a fair way of becom-
ing a celebrity when he suddenly dropped from
public view and betook himself to a secluded village
called arshamomoque at the eastern end of long
island where the errell family maintained a sum-
mer residence

  the house itself known locally as the mansion
stood on a hill overlooking the sound but suffi-
ciently back from the highway to insure a desirable
degree of privacy a spacious tower originally de-
signed for an observatory had been converted into
a research laboratory and here surrounded by the
most modern apparatus young errell worked fever-
ishly on his new invention-an invention which
even in its unfinished condition had already pro-
duced results so far-reaching in their consequences
and so revolutionary from a scientific point of view
that at times the young
man almost questioned his
own sanity

a wonderful projecting
machine

and now the ma-
chine was com-
pleted the young
inventor straightened up
took a deep breath and
reached for a cigar as
he did so the word
havana popped into his
mind

  well why not he
queried ill try havana for my first real test and
see how the ponies are running today

  whereupon he consulted a map noted the longi-
tude and latitude of that city and twirled the dials
of the cabinet to correspond then looking at his
watch which showed  pm he adjusted the upper
dial to  oclock the corresponding time for
havana

  a moments hesitation and then he reached over
and threw a little switch at the same time placing
his other hand on the knob that controlled the re-

volving mirrors a faint buzz and then a stream of
light from the cabinet illumined a white screen on
the opposite wall

  at first there was but a confused blur but as
he slowly turned the knob backward and forward
this presently crystallized into a panoramic view of
the havana race-track revealing the grandstand
thronged with wildly excited spectators and three
foam-specked horses tearing down the home stretch
almost neck and neck

  even as errell watched they flashed over the
line and a moment later the name of the winner
muchacho appeared on the bulletin board

  hot stuff he commented now for the next
test

  slowly almost solemnly he turned the upper dial
to the left-five ten fifteen twenty notches

  that should be the year  he said the
year of the great earthquake at san francisco

  consulting his map again he adjusted the lower
dials allowing  feet for altitude and again threw
the switch

  as before the picture first appeared as an indis-
tinguishable blur and then it changed gradually to
a clearly-defined birdseye view of the stricken city
and now he could behold great buildings come
crashing down throngs of panic-stricken citizens
scurrying through the streets in wild disorder
with here and there the smoke of incipient fires

  for some time he watched the awe-inspiring
spectacle then threw the cut-out switch and reset
the dials

  now ill try for distance as the radio fans
would put it he chuckled jubilant over his suc-
cess thus far

seeing st joan of arc

  reaching up he twirled the top dial rapidly to
the left with reckless disregard of this annihilation
of time and space until the indicator registered the
year 

  this should convince
the most skeptical he
said ill take a peek at
france in those bygone
days

  he thereupon computed
carefully the location of
the city of orleans and
made the proper adjust-
ments on the lower dials
then confident but deeply
impressed at the thought
of what was to come he
once more threw the
switch and regulated the
speed of the revolving mirrors until the pictures
on the screen synchronized with the actual event

  my god its joan of arc he cried as across
the silver screen in serried ranks swept the attack-
ing army at the siege of orleans at their head
clad in brightly shining armor flashing sword up-
lifted and a look of exaltation on her face rode the
warrior maid

  minute after minute he sat there with bated
breath-tremulous with excitement awed and yet
elated and then as he was resetting the dials

 tf we may believe einstein there can be nothing faster
 in our universe than light moving at the rate of -
  miles per second if einstein is right then the excel-
 lent story printed here is impossible but no one knoivs
 perhaps it is possible to catch up with the light rays that
 have gone into the beyond if it is possible to do so we
 should be able to photograph or throw on a screen at
 some future date how columbus actually discovered
 america and other famous historical events

  at any rate the time eliminator demands
your attention a very clever explanation is given of a
wonderful apparatus that does it all and is of great in-
terest


amazing stories

a thought came into his mind that sobered him with
a jolt ten minutes later he was speeding towards
new york in his big mercer

  at precisely  pm he was shown into the private
office of brig-general humiston commanding the
new secret intelligence department of the washing-
ton government

brig-general humiston and his daughter

not only the general but unknown to him his
daughter also had long taken a deep interest
in young errell the latters father and the
general having been classmates at west point this
interest was fully reciprocated especially in the
case of the daughter-a vivacious exponent of the
younger set

  but it was in his capacity as a government official
that erreil had called on general humiston having
determined to proffer his services and the services
of his invention as well to the country of his birth

  well my boy boomed the gruff old soldier
whats on your mind and why havent you been
to see us for so long jerry thinks you have for-
gotten her entirely

  general broke in the young man ignoring his
inquiry can you jump into my car and come down
to my place on long island at once i have some-
thing to show you something so breath-taking in
its possibilities and of such tremendous importance
to your department that every moment counts
are you in earnest demanded the general sit-
ting up with a jerk you want me to break a the-
atre engagement with jerry and go with you now
precisely that replied errell gravely then
hopefully why not bring jerry with you

  call at the biltmore in one hour was the re-
ply in curt military tones one or both of us will
be ready to go with you

  errells hand went up in salute he turned smartly
on his heel and left the room

  promptly on the hour the general appeared at
the motor entrance of the hotel followed closely by
jerry-bewitching in rich furs and silken coat
errells heart thumped riotously as he leaped from
the car and met her with outstretched hands

  oh jerry he cried its good to see you and
his eyes fully confirmed the words

  im from missouri was that young persons
flippant reply but the words could not disguise the
wonderful glow of happiness that irradiated the
lovely little face

  once out of the city the big car sped down the
island roaring past sleepy farms and villages as
it tore through the night and as the clock struck
 they drew up at the errell doorstep

  little was said on the outward trip but once in-
bide the house the general asked

  now errell whats it all about i hope you
havent dragged me down here on a wild goose
chase

  come up to my laboratory was errells reply
he waited a second then added you too jerry
she gave him a quick glance of appreciation

explanation of the invention

a moment more and they were in the lab-
oratory jerry and her father looking with
crank curiosity at the mysterious cabinet

  general and you too jerry began errell very
soberly what i am about to show you s some-
thing so fantastic so weird so utterly removed
from all human experience that before proceeding
further i feel i should prepare your minds for
what you are to behold please be seated and fol-
low closely he paused then went on

  when the dynamo at a power-house breaks down
every trolley car on that system stops and the elec-
tricity in the overhead wire and in the dynamo it-
self disappears-swallowed up in the earths gen-
eral store of electric force unless this electricity
can be made to reappear by starting up the dynamo
again street-car service on that system is a thing
of the past this is obvious now for the next
step

  you know how moving pictures are made with
a blas photographer turning a crank while the
villain chokes the heroine once the lights are
switched off however the scene has passed into ob-
livion-unless or until it is resurrected by project-
ing the film on to a screen what few people realize
is that every event on this earth leaves a record in
light rays whether or not a human photographer
is present to snap the picture

  in other words light rays persist or endure
since nothing is lost in nature to illustrate
through the medium of a powerful telescope we are
now able to get a view of celestial bodies which
without the aid of this instrument would necessi-
tate a journey of years in their direction in order
to obtain a corresponding view if a cataclysm
should destroy the martian canals today and we
should travel towards that planet in a projectile at
the rate of a mile a minute it would take years ere
we reached a point in space where the event would
become visible to our eyes or if we elected to re-
main here it would take just that much longer be-
fore the event would appear to the inhabitants of
this sphere

  again consider the curious paradox presented
last new years eve when couples in london danced
by radio during the last moments of  to music
played in berlin in  and then a few moments
later danced in  to music being played in new
york in  an evening paper in san francisco
might truthfully have stated on december st
the west end club of london danced the old year
out at  oclock this afternoon while a london
paper on the morning of january st might with
equal truth have announced the waikiki club of
honolulu will dance the new year in at 
oclock this forenoon

time is a measure of space

trom this you can readily comprehend that

w time is but a measure of space now for

  jl the final step

  in order to reproduce a past scene in nature
two problems arise first that of reproducing the
light rays in their proper sequence as i stated be-
fore nothing is lost in nature although it may
change its form so just a electricity can be made
to manifest itself again after disappearing so also
can light rays which persist be made to reappear
although no longer visible to the eye it is not
essential that the identical light rays of the
former scene be brought back only that th ray
the time eliminator



shall appear in their former sequence and intensi-
ties if you strike a church bell and repeat the
blow ten years later you reproduce the tone of that
bell perfectly although you do not get the original
sound wave

    projecting the generals last sundays ride
rnrhe second problem-that of correlating the
present position of this earth with the exact
 position in space which it occupied at the
instant the event actually happened-is more com-
plex involving as it does intricate problems in
geometry gravitational force relativity the earths
movement through space and other factors too com-
plicated for the lay mind

  errell waited a moment to give his hearers time
to grasp the significance of this last statement then
resumed

  these problems general have been solved in the
machine before you as  shall now proceed to dem-
onstrate where were you on sunday morning at
 oclock

  i was out for a morning canter in rock creek
park washington replied general humiston im-
pressed in spite of himself

  watch the screen in front of you commanded
errell meanwhile adjusting the dials of the cabinet

  a subdued buzzing noise and then before the as-
tonished gaze of the general and his daughter there
unrolled a panorama of the city of magnificent dis-
tances converging presently on the bridle path in
rock creek park a moment later the figure of
general humiston mounted on his big grey charger
came galloping into view

the most secret plans an open book

y god exclaimed that doughty soldier
springing to his feet do you realize
boy what this invention would mean to
your government why the most secret plans of
an enemy would be an open book to us

  it was for just that reason that i have brought
you here replied the young man gravely be-
fore we go further into that however is there any-
thing of special interest to your department right
now that you would like to know

  you couldnt teil me could you asked the gen-
eral stepping nearer in his excitement just who
were present at a secret conference at fontaine-
bleau last tuesday at  am

  just a moment cautioned errell as he read-
justed the dials and made the proper allowance for
time and distance now watch the screen

  again a faint buzzing noise then the light
flashed on and first came the eiffel tower into view
with its flaring automobile advertisement and then
fontainebleau even as they watched a closed car
drovp ip and the french minister of commerce
alighted and disappeared within the building then
came the english secretary of commerce and italys
representative followed a moment later by the rus-
sian commissioner promptly on the hour the ger-
man minister of trade and industries drove up
and joined the others

  errell glanced at the general who was trembling
with eagerness exultation and almost with fear

yes he muttered audibly they are all there

i know every one of them he was silent a moment

the

   i presume you have an inkling of what this con-
 ference means errell the idea is for each govern-
 ment here represented to control some commodity
 that is absolutely essential to american industry
 and then to boost the price to a figure so prohibitive
 as to provoke reprisals these will then be seized
 upon as a pretext for the breaking of treaties the
 next step is a world war against the united states
 -our tremendous store of gold the main objective
 but it takes money to finance a war these days
 objected errell

   precisely and therein is our strongest defense
 was the answer with fore-knowledge of what is
 contemplated our bankers can shut down on further
 loans abroad and curtail european credits this
 machine will enable us to prepare for any contin-
 gency by revealing every plan of the enemy we can
 make this country practically impregnable

   that is just it replied errell

   the first thing broke in the general is to
 safeguard your discovery should but a whisper
 of what you have accomplished get abroad your life
 would not be worth a candle

   i have thought of that said the younger man
 and for greater secrecy i think the machine should
 be kept here rather than in washington where in-
 evitably there would be a leak sooner or later you
 could run down here for frequent visits

   yes but i would have to have a very plausible
 reason for those visits interposed the general

 the apparatus wins the bride

ell - and here errell paused and
glanced at jerry who nodded brightly-
why not spend your week-ends here with
jerry and your new son-in-law we expect to be
married in june

   what whats that shouted the old general
 jerry your wife how do you get that way young
 man and he tried to look very stern in my
 day he added virtuously it was customary for
 the young ladys parents to be consulted

   um-m mused errell would you mind telling
 me in what year you were married

   i know cried jerry delightedly they were
 married in greenwich connecticut just  years
 ago today at  oclock in the afternoon

   hey wait a minute exclaimed her father in
 evident confusion as errell stepped to the little
 cabinet but he was too late already the machine
 had given its preliminary buzz and the next mo-
 ment they beheld a little two-seated ford 
 model bumping and swaying along the boston post
 road just west of the state line perhaps half a
 mile behind them came a horse and buggy the irate
 driver lashing his foam-flecked steed in a vain at-
 tempt to overtake the fleeing couple in the car

   errell glanced at jerry then at her father and
 back to the picture there could be no mistake
 the girl in the little ford might have been jerry
 herself save for the difference in dress while the
 handsome young chap at her side his eyef glued to
 the road bore a resemblance to her father ho strik-
 ing as to dispel any doubt of his identity

   you win laughed the general wiping his eyes
 take her my boy and may you be as hony as we
 were

  we were seated on the veranda of the hotel
washington in colon and the aviator had been re-

over the unexplored and unknown jungles of darien
he had sighted an isolated flat topped mountain
upon whose summit was a large city-of a thousand
houses or more-and without visible pass road or
stream leading to it

  it was rotten air hazen explained in reply to
my question and i couldnt get lower than 
feet so i cant say what the people were like but
i could see em running about first time i went over
and they were looking mightily excited then i
flew back for a second look and not a soul was in
sight-took to cover i expect but ill swear the
buildings were stone or dobe and not palm or
thatch

  why didnt you land and get acquainted en-
quired fenton sarcastically

  there was one spot that looked like a pretty
fair landing replied the
aviator but the air was
bad and the risk too big

how did i know the peo-
ple werent hostile it
was right in the kuna
indian country and even
if they were peaceable
they might have smashed
the plane or i mightnt
have been able to take off

i was alone too

  you say you made an
official report of your dis-
covery i said what
did the colonel think about it

  snorted and said he didnt see why in blazes i
bothered reporting an indian village

  its mighty interesting i declared i believe
youve actually seen the lost city hazen balboa
heard of it the dons spent years hunting for it
and every indian in darien swears it exists
well i never heard of it before said hazen
whats the yarn anyway

  according to the indian story theres a big city
on a mountain top somewhere in darien they say
no one has ever visited it that its guarded by evil
spirits and that it was there ages before the first
indians

if theyve never seen it how do they know its

there fenton demanded in my opinion its all
bosh how can there be a lost city in this bally
little country and why hasnt someone found it
why there are stories of lost cities and hidden

cities and such rot in every south and central
american country just fairy tales-pure bunk
i know there are lots of such yarns i admitted
and most of them i believe are founded on fact
your south american indian hasnt enough imag-
ination to make a story out of whole cloth its
easy to understand why and how such a place might
exist for centuries and no one find it this little
country as you call it could hide a hundred cities in
its jungles and no one be the wiser no civilized
man has ever yet been through the kuna country
but im going ill have a try for that city of
hazens

  well i wish you luck said fenton if the
kunas dont slice off the soles of your feet and turn
you loose in the bush and if you do find hazens
pipe dream just bring me back a souvenir will
you 

  with this parting shot he rose and sauntered off
towards the swimming pool

  do you really mean to have a go at that place
asked hazen as fenton disappeared

  i surely do i declared can you show me the
exact spot on the map where you saw the city

  for the next half hour we pored over the map
of panama and while-owing to the incorrectness
of the only available maps-hazen could not be
sure of the exact location of his discovery still he
pointed out a small area within which the strange
city was located

  youre starting on a mighty dangerous trip
he declared a i talked over my plans even if you
get by the kunas and find the place how are you
going to get out the
people may kill you or
make you a prisoner if
theyve been isolated for
so long i reckon they
wont let any news of
em leak out

  of course theres a
risk i laughed thats
what makes it so attrac-
tive im not worried over
the kunas though
theyre not half as bad as
painted i spent three
weeks among them two
years ago and had no trouble they may drive me
back but they dont kill people offhand getting out
will be the trouble as you say but ive first got to
get in and im not making plans to get out until
then	

  lord but i wish i were going too cried hazea
say i tell you what im going to do ill borrow
that old curtiss practice boat and fly over there
once in a while if youre there just wave a white
rag for a signal maybe the peoplell be so darned
scared if they see the plane that theyll not trouble
you might make a good play of it-let em think
youre responsible for it you know

  i dont know but thats a mighty good scheme
hazen i replied after a moments thought lets

amazing stories

see if i get off day after tomorrow i should be in
the kuna country in a week you might take your
first flight ten days from now but if things go
wrong i dont see as you can help me much if you
cant land

  well worry over that when the time comes
he said cheerfully a few days later i was being
paddled and poled up the canazas river with the
last outposts of civilization many miles behind and
the unknown jungles and the forbidden country of
the wild kunas ahead

  it was with the greatest difficulty that i had been
able to secure men to accompany me for the natives
looked with the utmost dread upon the kuna coun-
try and only two out f the scores i had asked
were willing to tempt fate and risk their lives in
the expedition into the unknown

  for two days now we had been within the forbid-
den district-the area guarded and held by the
kunas and into which no outsider is permitted to
enter-and yet we had seen or heard no signs of
indians but i was too old a hand and too familiar
with the ways of south american indians to delude
myself with the idea that we had not been seen or
our presence known i well knew that in every
likelihood we had been watched and our every
movement known since the moment we entered the
territory no doubt sharp black eyes were constant-
ly peering at us from the jungle while bows and
blowguns were ever ready to discharge their mis-
siles of death at any instant as long as we were not
molested or interfered with however i gave little
heed to this moreover i believed from my brief
acquaintance with the kunas of two years previ-
ously that they seldom killed a white man until
after he had been warned out of their country and
tried to return to it

  at night we camped beside the river making our
beds upon the warm dry sand and each day we
poled the cayuca up the rapids and deeper into the
forest at last we reached the spot where accord-
ing to my calculations we must strike through the
jungle overland to reach the mountain seen by
hazen hiding our dugout in the thick brush be-
side the river we packed the few necessities to be
carried with us and started off through the forest

  if hazen were not mistaken in his calculations
we should reach the vicinity of the mountain in
two days march even though the going was hard
and we were compelled to hew a way with our
machetes for miles at a stretch

  but its one thing to find a mountain top when
flying over the sea of jungle and quite another to
find that mountain when hidden deep in the forest
and surrounded on every side by enormous trees i
realized that we might easily pass within a few
hundred yards of the spot and never suspect it and
that we might wander for days searching for the
mountain without finding it it was largely a mat-
ter of luck after all but hazen had described the
surrounding country so minutely that i had high
hopes of success

  by the end of the first day in the bush we had
reached rough and hilly country which promised
well and it was with the expectation of reaching the
base of the mountain the following day that we
made camp that night still we had seen no indians

no signs of their trails or camps which did much
to calm the fears of my men and which i accounted
for on the theory that the kunas avoided this part
of the country through superstitious fears of the
lost city and its people

  at daybreak we broke camp and had tramped for
perhaps three hours when without warning jose
who was last in line uttered a terrified cry turn-
ing quickly i was just in time to see him throw up
his hands and fall in a heap with a long arrow
quivering in his back the kunas were upon us

  scarcely had the realization come to me when
an arrow thudded sharply into a tree by my side and
carlos with a wild yell of deadly fear threw down
his load and dashed madly away not an indian
could be seen to stand there a target for their
missiles was suicidal and turning i fled at my ut-
most speed after carlos how we managed to run
through that tangled jungle is still a mystery to
me but we made good time nevertheless fear
drove us and dodging between the giant trees leap-
ing fallen trunks tripping over roots and scrambl-
ing over rocks wre sped on

  and now from behind we could hear the sounds
of the pursuing indians their low gutteral cries
the sounds of breaking twigs and branches con-
stantly they were drawing nearer i knew that in
a few minutes they would be upon us-that at any
instant a poisoned blowgun dart or a barbed arrow
might bury itself in my body but still we strove
to escape

  then just as i felt that the end must be at hand
-just as i had decided to turn and sell my life dear-
ly-the forest thinned before us sunlight appeared
and the next moment we dashed from the jungle in-
to a space free from underbrush but covered with
enormous trees draped with gnarled and twisted
lianas the land here rose sharply and glancing
ahead between the trees i saw the indistinct out-
lines of a lofty mountain against the sky

  toiling up the slope breathing heavily utterly
exhausted i kept on then as a loud shout sound-
ed from the rear i turned to see five hideously
painted kunas break from the jungle but they did
not follow to my utter amazement they halted
gave a quick glance about and with a chorus of
frightened yells turned and dashed back into the
shelter of the jungle

  but i had scant time to give heed to this the
kunas cries were still ringing in my ears when a
scream from carlos drew my attention thinking
him attacked by savages i rushed towards him
drawing my revolver as i ran

  with bulging rolling eyes blanched face and
ghastly terror stricken features he was struggling
fighting madly with a writhing coiling gray ob-
ject which i took for a gigantic snake already his
body and legs were bound and helpless in the coils
with his machete he was raining blows upon the
quivering awful thing which slowly menacingly
wavered back and forth before him striving to
throw another coil about his body

  and then as i drew near my senses reeled i
felt that i was in some awful nightmare the ob-
ject so surely relentlessly silently encircling and
crushing him was no serpent but a huge liana
drooping from the lofty branches of a great tree
through the craters rim



  it seemed absolutely incredible impossible un-
believeable but even as i gazed transfixed with
horror paralyzed by the sight the vine threw its
last coil about the dying man and before my eyes
drew the quivering body into the trees above

  then something touched my leg with a wild
yell of terror i leaped aside a second vine was
writhing and twisting over the ground towards
me

  crazed with unspeakable fear i struck at the
thing with my machete at the blow the vine drew
sharply back while from the gash a thick yellow-
ish stinking juice oozed forth turning i started
to rush from the accursed spot but as i passed the
first tree another liana writhed forward in my path

  utterly bereft of my senses slashing madly as i
ran yelling like a madman i dodged from tree to
tree seeking the open spaces evading by a hairs
breadth the fearful menacing aerpent-like vines
until half-crazy torn panting and utterly spent i
dashed forth into a clear grassy space

  before me rising like a sheer wall against the
sky was a huge precipitous cliff of red rock

  now i knew why the kunas had not followed us
beyond the jungle they were aware of the man-
killing lianas and had left us to a worse death than
any they could inflict i was safe from them i felt
sure but was i any better off before me was an
impassable mountain side on either hand and in
the rear those awful blood-thirsty sinister vines
and lurking in the jungles were the savage kunas
with their fatal poisoned darts and powerful bows
i was beset on every side by deadly peril for i was
without food i had cast aside my gun and even
my revolver in my blind terror-crazed escape from
those ghastly living vines and to remain where i
was meant death by starvation or thirst

  but anything was better than this nightmare-
like forest at the thought i glanced with a shud-
der at the trees and my blood seemed to freeze in
my veins

  the forest was approaching me i could not be-
lieve my eyes now i felt i must be mad and fas-
cinated hypnotized i gazed striving my utmost
to clear my brain to make common sense contradict
the evidence of my eyes but it was no delusion
ponderously slowly but steadily the trees were
gliding noiselessly up the slope their great
gnarled roots were creeping and undulating over the
ground while the pendant vines writhed and swayed
and darted forth in all directions as if feeling their
way and then i saw what had before escaped me
the things were not lianas as i had thought they
were parts of the trees themselves-huge lithe
flexible tentacles springing from a thick fleshy
livid-hued crown of branches armed with stupend-
ous thorns and which slowly opened and closed like
hungry jaws above the huge trunks

  it was monstrous uncanny supernatural a
hundred yards and more of open ground had
stretched between me and the forest when i had
flung myself down but now a scant fifty paces re-
mained in a few brief momenta the fearsome
things would be upon me but i was petrified in-
capable of moving hand or foot too terrified and
overwhelmed even to cry out

  nearer and nearer the ghastly things came i

could hear the pounding of my heart a cold
sweat broke out on my body i shivered as with
ague then a long warty tentacle darted towards
me and as the loathsome stinking thing touched
my hand the spell was broken with a wild scream
i turned and dashed blindly towards the precipice
seeking only to delay only to avoid for a time the
certain awful death to which i was doomed for the
cliff barred all escape and i could go no farther

chapter ii

amazing discoveries

a dozen leaps and i reached the wall of rock
beyond which all retreat was cut off close
at hand was an out jutting buttress and
thinking that back of this i might hide and thus
prolong my life i raced for it

  panting unseeing i reached the projection
ducked behind it and to my amazement and un-
speakable delight found myself in a narrow canyon
or defile like a huge cleft in the face of the preci-
pice

  here was safety for a time the terrible man-
eating trees could not enter and striving only to
put a greater distance between myself and the veg-
etable demons i never slackened my pace as i turned
and sped up the canyon

  narrower and narrower it became far above
my head the rocky walls leaned inward shutting out
the light until soon it was so dim and shadowy that
through sheer necessity i was forced to stop run-
ning and to pick my way carefully over the masses
of rock that strewed the canyons floor presently
only a narrow ribbon of sky was visible between the
towering walls of the pass then this was blotted
out and i found myself in the inky blackness of a
tunnel-an ancient watercourse-leading into the
very bowels of the mountain

  but there was no use in hesitating anything
was preferable to the cannibal trees and groping
my way i pressed on winding and twisting turn-
ing sharply the passageway led ever ascending
steeply and taxing my exhausted muscles and over-
wrought system to the utmost then far ahead i
heard the faint sound of dripping falling water and
with joy at thought of burying my aching head in
the cold liquid and of easing my parched dry
throat i hurried stumbling through the tunnel

  at last i saw a glimmer of light in the distance
and in it the sparkle of the water before me was
the end of the tunnel and sunlight and with a final
spurt of speed i rushed towards it then just as i
gained the opening and so suddenly and unexpect
edly that he seemed to materialize from thin air
a man rose before me

  unable to check my speed too thunderstruck at
the apparition to halt i dashed full into him and
together we rolled head over heels upon the ground

  i have said he was a man but even in that brief
second that i glimpsed him before i bowled him
over i realized that he was unlike any man i or
anyone else had ever seen barely three feet in
height squat with enormous head and shoulders he
stood shakily upon the tiniest of bandy legs and
half supported his weight by his enormously long
muscular arms had it not been that he was partly

clothed and that his face wag hairless i should
have thought him an ape and now as i picked
myself up and stared at him my jaws gaped in ut-
ter amazement the fellow was running from me at
top speed upon his hands his feet waving and sway-
ing in the air

  so utterly dumbfounded was i at the sight that i
stood there silently gazing after the strange being
until he vanished behind a clump of bushes then
as it dawned upon me that no doubt there were
others near and that as he had shown no sign of
hostility they were likely peaceable i hurried after
him

  a narrow trail led through the brush and running
along this i burst from the shrubbery and came to
an abrupt halt utterly astounded at the sight which
met my eyes i was standing at the verge of a little
rise beyond which stretched an almost circular
level plain several miles in diameter massed upon
this in long rows compact groups and huge squares
were hundreds of low flat-roofed stone buildings
while upon a smooth green plot at a little distance
stood a massive truncated pyramid

  unwittingly i had reached my goal eefore me
was the lost city of darien hazen had been right

  but it was not this thought nor the strange city
and its buildings that held my fascinated gaze but
the people everywhere they swarmed upon the
streets the housetops even on the open land of the
plain they crowded and each and every one an ex-
act counterpart of the one with whom i had collided
at the mouth of the tunnel and like him too all
were walking or running upon their hands with
their feet in air

  all this i saw in the space of a few seconds
then to add to my astonishment i saw that many
of the impossible beings actually were carrying
burdens in their upraised feet some bore baskets
others jars or pots others bundles while one group
that was approaching in my direction held bows
and arrows in their toes and held them most men-
acingly at that

  it was evident that i had been seen the excite-
ment of the beings their gestures and the manner
in which they peered towards me from between
their arms left no doubt of it while the threaten-
ing defensive attitude of the bowmen proved that
they were ready to attack or defend at a moments
notice

  no doubt to them my appearance was as re-
markable as inexplicable and as amazing as they
were to me the greater portion were evidently
filled with terror and scurried into their houses
yet many still stood their ground while a few were
so overcome with curiosity and surprise that they
dx-opped feet to earth and rested right side up in
order to stare at me more intently

  i realized that it behooved me to do something
to stand there motionless and speechless gazing
at the strange folk while they stared back would
accomplish nothing but what to do what move to
make that was a serious question if i attempt-
ed to approach them a shower of arrows might well
end my career and my investigations of the place
then and there it was equally useless to retrace
my steps even had i been so minded for only cer-

tain death lay back of me by some means i must
win the confidence or friendship of these outland-
ish beings if only temporarily a thousand ideas
flashed through my mind

  if only hazen would appear the creatures of the
city might think i had dropped from the sky and so
look upon me as a supernatural being but it was
hopeless to expect such a coincidence or to look for
him i had told him to fly over on the tenth day
and this was only the seventh if only i had re-
tained my revolver the discharge of the weapon
might frighten them into thinking me a god but
my firearms lay somewhere in the demon forest i
had heard no sounds of voices no shouting and i
wondered if the beings were dumb maybe i
thought if i should speak-should yell--i might
impress them but on the other hand the sound
of my voice might break the spell and cause them
to attack me a single mistake the slightest false
move might seal my doom i was in a terrible
quandary all my former experiences with savage
unknown tribes passed through my mind and i
strove to think of some incident some little event
which had saved the day in the past and might be
put to good use now

  and as i thus pondered i unconsciously reached
in my pocket for my pipe filled it with tobacco and
placing it between my lips struck a match and
puffed forth a cloud of smoke instantly from the
weird creatures a low wailing sibilant sound
arose the archers dropped their bows and arrows
and with one accord the people threw themselves
grovelling on the ground unintentionally i had
solved the problem to these beings i was a fire-
breathing awful god

  realizing this knowing that when dealing with
primitive races full of superstitions one must in-
stantly follow up an advantage i hesitated no
longer puffing lustily at my pipe i strode forward
and approached the nearest prostrate group mo-
tionless they buried their faces in the dust bodies
pressed to earth not daring to look up or even
steal a surreptitious glance at the terrible smoke-
belching being who towered over them never had
i seen such a demonstration of abject fear such
utter debasement it really was pitiful to see them
to view their trembling panting bodies quivering
with nameless terror terror so great they dared
not flee even though they knew by my footsteps
that i was among them and feared that at any
moment an awful doom might descend upon them

  but their very fright defeated my purpose i had
won safety and even adoration perhaps but there
could be no amity no intercourse no means of
mingling with them of securing food of learning
anything if they were to remain cowering on the
ground by some means i must win a measure of
their confidence i must prove that i was a friendly
beneficent deity and yet i must still be able to im-
press them with my powers and control them
through fear

  it was a delicate matter to accomplish but it had
to be done almost at my feet lay one of the arch-
ers-a leader or chieftain i thought from the feath-
er ornaments he wore-and stooping i lifted him
gently at my touch he fairly palpitated with ter-
through the craters rim



ror but no frightened scream no sound save an in-
drawn snake-like hiss escaped his lips and he of-
fered no resistance as i lifted him to a kneeling
position

  hitherto i had hid no opportunity to obtain a
good view of these peopla but now i saw this fel-
low close at hand i was amazed at his repulsive
ugliness i have seen some rather ugly races but
all of them combined and multiplied a hundredfold
would be beauties compared to these dwarfed top-
sy-turvy denizens of the lost city almost black
low browed with tiny shifty eyes like those of a
reptile with enormous thick lipped mouths sharp
fang-like teeth and matted hair the bowman
seemed far more like an ape than like a human be-
ing and then i noticed a most curious thing he
had no ears where they should have been were
merely round bare spots covered with light colored
thin membrane like the ears of a frog for an in-
stant i thought it a malformation or an injury but
as i glanced at the others i saw that all were the
same not one possessed a human ear all this i
took in as i lifted the fellow up then as he
tremblingly raised his head and eyed me i spoke to
him trying to make ray tones gentle and reassuring
but there was no response no sign of intelligence
or understanding in his dull frightened eyes there
was nothing to do but to fall back on sign language
and rapidly i gestured striving to convey to him
that i would do no injury or harm that i was
friendly and that i wished the people to rise

  slowly a look of comprehension dawned upon his
ugly face and then to prove my friendship i
fished in my pocket found a tiny mirror and placed
it in his hand at the expression of utter astonish-
ment that overspread his ugly features as he looked
in the glass i roared with laughter but the mir-
ror won the day uttering sharp strange hissing
sounds the fellow conveyed the news to his com-
panions and slowly hesitatingly and with lingering
fear still on their faces the people rose and gazed
upon me with strangely mingled awe and curiosity

  mainly they were men but scattered among them
were many who evidently were women although all
were so uniformly repulsive in features that it was
difficult to distinguish the sexes all too were
clad much alike in single garments of bark-cloth
resembling gunnysacks with holes cut at the four
corners for legs and arms and an opening for the
head

  but while there was no variation in the form
or material of the clothing yet some wore orna-
ments and others did not leg and arm bands of
woven fibre were common many of the men had
decorations of bright hued feathers attached to
arms or legs or fastened about their waists and
many were elaborately tattooed that such primi-
tive dwarfed ugly degenerate creatures could have
built the city of stone houses could have laid out
the broad paved streets and could have developed so
much of civilization seemed incredible

  but i had little time to devote to such thoughts
the fellow i had presented with the mirror was
hissing at me like a serpent and by signs was try-
ing to indicate that i was to follow him so with

the crowd trailing behind us we started up the
road towards the centre of the city

             chapter iii
             before the king

tiuly no stranger jjrocession had ever been
seen by human eyes

before me the chief archer led the way
walking upon his great calloused hands and with
his bow grasped firmly in one prehensile foot and
his precious mirror in the other on either side
and in the rear were scores of the weird beings
hurrying along on their hands keeping up an in-
cessant hissing sound like escaping steam black
legs and feet waving and gesticulating in air and at
first glance appearing like a crowd of headless
dwarfs how i wished that fenton might have been
there to see

  apparently my actions had been closely watched
from the safe retreats of the houses and word pass-
ed that i was not to be feared for as we reached
the first buildings the edges of the roofs and the
tiny window slits were lined with curious ugly faces
peering at us it was then that i noticed that none
of the buildings had doors the walls rising blank
to the roofs save for the narrow windows while
ladders here and there in place proved that the
inhabitants like the pueblo indians entered and
left their dwellings through the roofs

  now and then as we passed along some of the
more venturesome beings would join the procession
scrambling nimbly down the ladders sometimes up-
side down on their hands often using both hands
and feet but always using hands only as soon as
they reached the ground

  how or why they had developed this extraor-
dinary mode of progression puzzled me greatly for
there seemed no scientifically good reason for it
among tribes who habitually use boats weak legs
and enormously developed shoulders chests and
arms are common and i could well understand how
a race depending entirely upon water for trans-
portation might through generations of inbreed-
ing and isolation lose the use of legs

  but here was a people who apparently had no
conveyances of any kind who must of necessity
travel about to cultivate their crops who must
carry heavy burdens in order to construct their
buildings and to whom legs would seem a most im-
portant matter and yet with legs and feet so
atrophied and arms so tremendously developed that
they walked on their hands and used their feet as
auxiliaries it was a puzzle i longed to solve and
that i would have investigated thoroughly had fate
permitted me to dwell longer in the strange city
but i am getting ahead of my story

  presently we reached a large central square sur-
rounded by closely set buildings approaching one
of these my guide signalled that i was to follow
him as he swiftly ascended the ladder to the roof
rather hesitatingly for i doubted if the frail affair
would support my weight i climbed gingerly up
and found myself upon the broad flat roof before
me were several dark openings with the ends of
ladders projecting from them and down one of these


amazing stories

my guide led the way at the bottom of the ladder
i was in a large obscure room lit only by the slits
of windows high in the walls and for a moment i
could see nothing of my surroundings although
from all sides issued the low hissing sounds that i
now knew were the language of these remarkable
people then as my eyes became accustomed to
the dim light i saw that a score of beings were
squatted about the sides of the room while directly
before me on a raised dais or platform was seated
the largest and ugliest individual i had seen

  that he was a ruler a king or high priest was
evident in place of the sack-like garment of his
people he was clad in a long robe of golden green
feathers upon his head was a feather crown of
the same hue about his wrists and ankles were
golden bands studded with huge uncut emeralds
and a string of the same stones hung upon his
chest

  the throne if such it could be called was draped
with a green and gold rug and everywhere upon the
walls of the chamber were paintings of strange
misshapen uncouth creatures and human beings all
in the same green and yellow tints something in
the surroundings in the drawings and the costume
of the king reminded me of the aztecs or mayas
and while quite distinct from either i felt sure
that in some long past time these dwellers of the
lost city had been influenced by or had been in con-
tact with these ancient civilizations

  as i stood before the dais my guide prostrated
himself before the green robed monarch and then
rising carried on what appeared to be an animated
account of my arrival and the subsequent happen-
ings

  as he spoke silence fell upon those present and
the king listened attentively glancing now and then
at me and regarding me with an expression of com-
bined fear respect and enmity i could readily
understand what his feelings were no doubt he
was a person of far greater intelligence than his
subjects and while more or less afraid of such
a strange being as myself and superstitious enough
to think me supernatural yet in me he saw a pos-
sible usurper of his own power and prominence
and if he had dared he would have been only too
glad to have put me out of the way

  at the end of the archers narrative the fellow
handed his mirror to the king who uttered a sharp
exclamatory hiss as he saw his own ugly counten-
ance reflected in it forgetting court etiquette and
conventions in their curiosity the others gathered
about and as the mirror passed from hand to hand
their amazement knew no bounds

  all of these men i now saw were clad in green
or green and white and were evidently of high rank
priests or courtiers i took it but otherwise were
as undersized and repulsive as the common people
on the streets

  suddenly i was aroused from my contemplation
of the room and its occupants by my guide who
came close and by signs ordered me to perform the
miracle of smoking very ceremoniously and de-
liberately i drew out my pipe filled it and struck
a match at the bright flare of the flame king and
courtiers uttered a wailing hiss of fear and threw

themselves upon the floor but they were of dif-
ferent stuff from their people or else the guide had
prepared them for the event for the king soon
raised his head and glancing dubiously at me and
finding i had not vanished in fire and smoke as
he no doubt expected he resumed his sitting pos-
ture and in sharp tones ordered his fellows to do
likewise

  but despite this it was very evident that he and
his friends were in dread of the smoke from my
mouth and nose while the tobacco fumes caused
them to sputter and cough and choke this at last
was more than even the king could stand and by
signs he made it clear that he wished me to end
the demonstration of my fire eating ability then
he rose and to my unbounded surprise stood erect
and stepped forward like an ordinary mortal upon
his feet here was an extraordinary thing was
the king of a distinct race or stock or was the use
of nether limbs for talking confined to the royal
family or to individuals

  it was a fascinating scientific problem to soive
i had no time to give it any consideration however
for the king was now addressing me in his snake-
like dialect and was trying hard to make his mean-
ing clear by signs for a moment i was at a loss
but presently i grasped his meaning he was asking
whence i had come and from the frequency with
which he pointed upward i judged he thought i
had dropped from the sky

  then a brilliant idea occurred to me as i re-
membered hazens story and his suggestion regard-
ing his return by plane pointing upward i made
the best imitation of a motors exhaust that i could
manage there was no doubt that the monarch
grasped my meaning he grinned nodded and
swept his arm in a wide semicircle around his head
evidently to represent the course of the plane when
hazen had flown over the city

  seemingly satisfied and i judged deeply impress-
ed as well he resumed his seat gave a few orders
to his fellows and summoning my guide spoke a
few words to him thereupon the archer signalled
me to follow and led the way across the room but
i noticed that the king had not returned the mirror

  ascending the ladder to the roof the fellow hur-
ried across to a second building scrambled down
another ladder and we entered a large room in
one corner swung a large fiber hammock in the
centre was spread a cloth decorated in green and
gold and as we entered two women appeared each
carrying handsome earthenware dishes of food
whose savory odors whetted my already ravenous
appetite

  marvelous as it was to see these impossible beings
carrying food in their uplifted feet and walking on
their hands yet i had now become somewhat ac-
customed to the people and i was so famished that
i hardly gave the upside down serving maids a
second glance

  the food was excellent-consisting of vegetables
some sort of fricasseed game and luscious fruits-
and as i ate my guide squatted near and regarded
me with the fixed half adoring half frightened look
that one sees on the face of a strange puppy

  i judged that he had been appointed my own per-
through the craters rim



sonal guard or valet-it mattered little which-and
i was not sorry for he seemed a fairly decent speci-
men of his race and we already had become pretty
well accustomed to each others signs and gestures
wishing to still further establish myself in his
confidence and feeling rather sorry for him because
of the loss of his treasured mirror i searched my
pockets for some other trinket my possessions
however were limited they consisted of a stub of
a leadpencil a note book a few coins my handker-
chief my watch my pocketknife a few loose pistol
cartridges my pipe and tobacco and a box of
matches as i drew all these out a sudden fear
gripped me i had barely a dozen matches remain-
ing and my supply of tobacco was perilously low
what would happen when i could no longer pro-
duce fire and smoke when called upon to do so

  but i controlled my fears and comforted myself
with the thought that possibly after having felt
the effects of tobacco smoke the king would not
soon demand another miracle at my hands and
that before either matches or tobacco was exhaust-
ed something might well happen to solve any prob-
lems that might arise nevertheless i heartily wish-
ed that i had arranged with hazen to bring supplies
in case they were needed and which he could have
easily dropped as he flew over

  it would i now realized have proved an extreme-
ly impressive thing for the people to have seen me
secure my magic from the giant roaring bird in
the sky but i had never of course dreamed of
such adventures as i had met and could not possibly
have foreseen the need of such things just the
same i cursed myself for a stupid fool for not hav-
ing provided for any contingency and especially for
not having arranged a series of signals with hazen
however i was familiar with wigwagging and de-
cided that if necessity arose it would be quite
feasible for me to signal to him by means of my
handkerchief tied on a stick also i felt a bit
easier in my mind from knowing that near the city
was a splendid landing place for the plane and that
hazen if signalled would unquestionably attempt
a descent

  truly it was not every explorer in a predicament
like mine who could count on being able to summon
aid from the clouds if worst came to worst or who
knew that a friend in an airplane would keep track
of his whereabouts indeed i almost chuckled at
the thought of being in this long lost city among
these incredible folk and yet within two hundred
miles of the canal and civilization and with another
american due to hover above-and even communi-
cate with me-within the next three days it was
all so dreamlike so utterly preposterous that i
scarcely could force myself to believe it and having
dined well and feeling desperately tired i flung
myself into the hammock and almost instantly drop-
ped off to sleep

  it was still daylight when i awoke and the room
was empty ascending the ladder to the roof with-
out meeting anyone i climbed down the other lad-
der to the street many people were about and
while a few especially the women and children
threw themselves on their faces or scampered into
their houses at my approach yet the majority

merely prostrated themselves for a moment and
then stood supporting themselves in their ape-like
way and stared curiously at me i had gone but a
short distance when my valet came hurrying to- my
side but he made no objections to my going where
i wished and i was glad to see that my movements
were not to be hampered as i was anxious thorough-
ly to explore the city and its neighborhood curious
to learn the purpose of the pyramidal structure i
had noticed i proceeded in that direction and was
soon in a part of the town given over to stalls shops
and markets there were also several workshops
such as pottery makers a woodworking shop and
a weavers shop and i spent  some time watching
the artizans at their work somehow from seeing
the people walk upon their hands i had expected to
see them perform their tasks with their feet and
it came as something of a surprise to see these fel-
lows using their hands like ordinary mortals

  beyond this portion of the city the houses were
scattered the outlying buildings were more or less
patched and out of repair and were very evidently
the abode of the poorer classes although the in-
habitants i saw and who retreated the instant they
saw me were exactly like all the others as far as
i could see both in dress and feature passing
these huts i crossed the smooth green field which
i now saw was a perfect landing place for the plane
tethered to stakes and grazing on the grass were
a number of animals which as i first noticed them
i had taken for goats and cattle but now i dis-
covered that they were all deer and tapirs it was
a great surprise to see these animals domesticated
but after all it was not remarkable for i should
have known had i stopped to give the matter
thought that goats sheep and cattle were unknown
to the aboriginal americans and that this city and
its people who had never been visited and had
never communicated with other races would of
necessity be without these well known animals

  moreover i knew that the mayas were supposed
to have used tapirs as beasts of burden and while
i was standing there watching the creatures a man
approached riding astride a big tapir and driving
a second one loaded with bags of charcoal and gar-
den produce here then was a partial solution of
the manner by which these weak dwarfed people
built their stone houses for with the powerful
elephant-like tapirs-and i noticed all were the
giant bairds tapir which reaches a weight of
seven or eight hundred pounds-they could easily
haul the blocks of stone from a quarry and by means
of tackle and inclined planes could readily hoist
the stones to the tops of the walls

  i had now reached the base of the pyramid and
found it a massive structure of the same flinty
stone as the other buildings running from base to
summit was a spiral path or stairway and instantly
i knew that it was a sacrificial pyramid exactly like
those used by the aztecs and on which unfortunate
beings were killed and sacrificed this discovery
still further confirmed my suspicions that these peo-
ple were either of aztec or maya blood or had been
influenced by those races filled with curiosity to
see the altar on the summit i started up the sloping
stairs i was at first doubtful if my companion


amazing stories

would permit this for the structure was sacred
and doubtless only priests of the highest order were
permitted upon it evidently however my guide
thought that such a supernatural being or god as
myself had every right to invade the most sacred
places and he offered no objection but prostrated
himself at the base of the pyramid as i ascended

  at the summit i found as i had expected the
sacrificial stone a huge block elaborately carved in
hieroglyphs and with channels to permit the blood
to drain off while close at hand was a massive
carved stone collar or yoke exactly like those which
have been found in porto rico and have so long
puzzled scientists from the blood stains upon
this i felt sure it was used to hold down the victims
head and neck while strong metal staples set into
the p stone indicated that the man destined for
sacrifice was spread-eagled and his ankles and wrists
bound fast to the rings

  it was a most interesting spot from a scientific
standpoint but decidedly gruesome while the stench
of putrefied blood and fragments of human flesh
clinging to the stones was nauseating and i was
glad to retrace my steps and descend to the ground

  from the top of the pyramid i had obtained a fine
view of the plain and city and i had noted that the
former was surrounded on all sides with steep cliffs
and i realized that the plain was not a flat topped
mountain as i had thought but the crater of an ex-
tinct volcano

  i saw no path pass or opening by which the
crater-valley could be entered but i knew there
was the one by which i had arrived as the sun
here on the mountain top was still well above the
horizon i decided to visit the entrance to the tunnel
for i was anxious to know why the people should
leave this avenue open when on every other side
they were completely cut off from the outer world
possibly i thought they knew of those horrible
man-eating trees and trusted to them to guard the
city from intruders or again they might keep the
entrance guarded for the fellow i had knocked over
as i dashed in had been at the tunnel mouth and for
all i knew he might have been an armed guard and
was merely so thunderstruck at my precipitate ap-
pearance that he forgot his duties and his weapons

  with such thoughts running through my mind i
strolled across the plain past well-tilled gardens
and fields in several of which i saw men ploughing
with well made plows drawn by tapirs even the
farmers stopped their work and prostrated them-
selves as i passed and it was evident that word of
my celestial origin and supernatural character had
gone forth to every inhabitant of the valley

  following the path i reached the little rise from
which i had first viewed the city and soon came to
the spot where i had entered imagine my utter
surprise when i saw no sign whatever of the open-
ing i was positive that i had not missed my way
i recognized the clumps of bushes and the forms of
the rocks but there was no dark hole no aperture
in the cliff then as i drew near to the precipice
i made an astounding discovery closely fitted into
the rock and so like it that it had escaped my at-
tention was an enormous stone door how it was
operated whether it was hinged or slid or whether

it was pivoted i could not determine but that it
covered and concealed the entrance to the tunnel
i was convinced why the people had left the tun-
nel open as though to clear the way for me why
they should have fitted a door to it why they should
ever use the tunnel which could bring them only
to the death-dealing forest were problems which i
could not solve

  at any rate there was nothing to be gained by
staying there and i started back towards the city
thinking to return by another route i took a path
that led towards the opposite mountain side and
presently from ahead i distinctly heard the sound
of metal striking stone

  oddly enough my mind had been so filled with
other matters that i had hardly wondered how these
people cut or worked the hard stone but now that
my attention was attracted by the sound my curios-
ity was aroused and i hurried forward what metal
i wondered did these people use for metal i
knew it must be from the ringing clinking noise
was i about to see hardened bronze tools in actual
use or had these marvelous folk discovered the use
of iron or steel so astounding had been all my
experiences so paradoxical and incredible every-
thing i had seen that i was prepared for almost
anything i or rather we soon came to the verge
of a deep pit wherein laboring at great masses of
white stone were scores of workmen standing
like skeletons among the blocks were derricks
hitched to sledge-like drags loaded with stone were
teams of tapirs and on the farther side was a big
out jutting ledge from which the stone was being
quarried hurrying down the steep trail i reached
the bottom of the pit to find every man flat on the
ground

  signalling to my companion that i wished to have
the fellows go on with their work i approached the
nearest slab of rock it was the same fine grained
whitish rock of which the city was built and lying
upon it where they had been dropped by the stone
cutters were several small hammers chisels and an
adze-like tool that they were not bronze or any
alloy of copper i knew at the first glance their
color was that of tempered steel and they seemed
ridiculously small for the purpose of working this
hard stone if these people used steel then i had
indeed made a discovery and intent on this matter
i picked up one of the tools to examine it no
sooner had i lifted it that i uttered an involuntary
exclamation of surprise the hammer although
hardly larger than an ordinary tack hammer
weighed fully ten pounds it was heavier than if
made of solid gold there was only one known
metal that could be so heavy and that was platinum
but platinum it could not be for that metal is
softer than gold and would be of no more use for
cutting rock than so much lead the tools however
were undoubtedly hard-the polished surface of the
hammer-head and the chisels and the unscarred
keen edges of the latter showed this and anxious
to test their hardness i held a chisel against the
rock and struck it sharply with a hammer

  once more i cried out in wonder for the chisel
had bitten fully half an inch into the stone it
had cut it as easily as if the rock were cheese
through the craters rim



what marvel was this what magic lay in these
tools and then the secret dawned upon me and a
moments examination of the stone confirmed my
suspicions it was not that the tools were so very
hard or keen but that the rock was soft-so soft
that i could readily cut it with my pocket knife
a wax-like earthy rock which no doubt became hard
upon exposure to the air exactly like the coral rock
of bermuda which may be quarried with saws and
even planed but becomes as hard as limestone after
exposure to the elements still the tools were far
harder than any metal except tempered steel and
for some time i puzzled over the matter as i watched
the workmen now over their fright and adoration
skilfully cutting and squaring the blocks of stone
it was one more conundrum i could not solve and
it was not until long afterwards when a careful
analysis of the metal was made that i knew the
truth the metal was an alloy of platinum and
iridium-the later one of the hardest of all known
metals

  as we left the quarry and made our way toward
the city i noticed an immense aqueduct stretching
across the land from the apparently solid mountain
side just above the quarry i had given little
thought to how the people secured water here in the
crater but it was now apparent that it was brought
from some source by the stone conduit keenly
curious to know whence it came for i could not
imagine how a river lake or spring could exist on
the crater rim i wished to investigate but darkness
was coming on i was tired and i deferred further
exploration until another day

  although i suppose i should have been grateful
for being able to communicate with the people at
all yet i keenly felt the lack of a common medium
of conversation for the sign language was limited
and i could not secure the information i so much
desired about many matters that puzzled me

  nothing further of interest transpired that night
i was supplied with food i slept soundly and did
not awaken until roused by the women with my
breakfast very soon afterwards i was summoned
to the throne room by zip as i called my companion
and once more i had to strike a match and smoke
my pipe for the kings benefit this time a second
personage of high rank was beside him a villainous
looking hunchbacked dwarf with red vicious eyes
and cruel mouth but who like the king walked on
his feet from his elaborately decorated white robes
and the mitre-like crown of quetzal feathers on his
gray head i concluded he was a high priest for
in the designs upon his costume and the form of
his crown i saw a decided resemblanoe to the aztec
priests as shown in the picturegraph of that race
moreover the quetzal or resplendant trogon was
i knew the sacred bird of the aztecs and mayas
and while i was aware that it was common in the
northern portions of panama i had never heard of
its occurrence in darien a fact which still further
confirmed my belief that these people were of aztec
stock but if this were the ease it was a puzzle as
to why they should be so undersized malformed and
physically degenerate for both the aztecs and
mayas were powerful well-formed races the
only solution i could think of was the supposition

that isolation and intermarriage through centuries
had brought about such results

  but to return to my audience with the king i
was not all pleased at thus having to use my
precious matches and tobacco and i foresaw some
very unpieasant developments in store for me if the
performance was to be of daily occurrence it was
manifest that i must devise some new and startling
exhibition of my powers if i were to retain my
prestige and my freedom for i well knew from
past experiences with savage races and from the
character of these potentates that if i failed to
perform miracles and became in their eyes an or-
dinary mortal my career would come to an abrupt
end

  to be sure there was the reassuring fact that
hazen would or should appear within the next forty-
eight hours but it was decidedly problematical as
to whether i could communicate with him or could
receive any aid from the air however there was
nothing to be done but obey and puff away at my
pipe with the idea of cutting the exhibition short
i stepped closer to the throne and blew the smoke
towards the faces of the king and the priest the
monarch was soon coughing and spluttering but
he was game while the priest to my amazement
sniffed the smoke and seemed to enjoy it here was
trouble evidently he had a natural taste for tobac-
co and this fact caused me a deal of worry for if
the old rascal took it into his head to acquire the
habit and demanded i should let him try a puff at
the pipe i would be in a pretty fix indeed

  however my fears on this score were groundless
and presently the king who could stand it no longer
signalled for me to depart which i did most gladly

  i still had it in mind to investigate the water
supply and with zip-reminding me of an aero-
batic down-beside me headed for the aqueduct
this i found was of stones dovetailed together in
water tight joints and built like an open trough
and the speed of the water flowing through it proved
the supply well above the citys level it was an
easy matter to follow the conduit for a well-trodden
path was beside it but it was a steep up-grade climb
for nearly a mile before i gained the spot where
the aqueduct tapped the mountain rim here the
water gushed from a hole in the solid rock and
from its volume i knew it must come from some
large reservoir from where i stood i could look
directly down into the quarry and the thought flash-
ed through my mind that if the people continued
to quarry in the place for many more years they
would undermine and weaken the foundations of the
aqueduct

  it was their lookout not mine however and still
intent on tracing the water to its source i turned
up a trail that appeared to lead to the mountain
top in places this was excessively steep and here
zip exhibited a new habit of his people dropping
his feet he proceeded to climb the path on all fours
his feet first and his prehensile toes grasping every
projection and bit of rock to draw him along while
his immense powerful hands supported his weight
and pushed him onward he looked more like a
gigantic spider than anything and not in the least
human panting and blown i at last gained the sum-
amazing storifis

mit and looked down upon a lake of dismal black
water filling a circular crater about half a mile in
diameter close by was an aperture in the rock
and half-filled with water and it was evident that
this was connected with the outlet below by means
of a shaft whether this was a natural formation
or had been laboriously cut by hand i could not tell
but i was prepared for almost anything by this
time and was not greatly surprised to find a clever-
ly constructed sluice gate arranged above the open-
ing to regulate the flow of water i had seen similar
crater lakes in the extinct volcanoes of the west
indies but i was surprised that hazen had not
mentioned it but on second thought i realized
that when flying over it the dark water surrounded
by vegetation would hardly be visible and might
easily be mistaken for heavy shadow or an empty
crater while the aviators surprise at the city would
fix his attention upon it to the exclusion of all
surroundings

  standing upon the rock ridge several hundred
feet above the city i had almost the same view as
hazen had from his plane and i could understand
how at an elevation of  feet or more he
had been unable to obtain any very accurate idea
of the buildings or people i also realized with a
sinking of my heart that it would be next to im-
possible for him to recognize me or to see any
signals i might make

  the most prominent spot in the entire valley
was the pyramid for this was isolated upon the
green plain and the sun striking through a gap
in the eastern rim of the crater shone directly upon
the altars summit thus bringing it out in sharp
relief indeed it looked for all the world like a
pylon on an aviation field if i expected to make
my presence known to hazen or to signal to him
my best point of vantage would be the summit of
the pyramid and i determined to climb there and
await his arrival when he should be due two days
later

  little did i dream at the time of the conditions
under which i would await him upon that gruesome
altar

chapter iv

the sacrifice

by the time we had descended the mountain
and had reached the city it was noon and
going to my quarters i was glad to find an
excellent meal having finished eating i threw
myself into the hammock and despite my scarcity
of matches and tobacco indulged in a smoke then
feeling drowsy i took off my coat placed it on the
floor beside my hammock and closed my eyes

  i awoke refreshed and reached for my coat only
to leap from the hammock with a cry of alarm the
coat was gone quickly i searched the room think-
ing zip might have placed the garment elsewhere
while i slept but the place was bare zip was no-
where to be seen and even the rug on which meals
were served had been removed

  here was a pretty state of affairs my coat con-
tained my matches pipe tobacco pocket knife and
handkerchief without it i was lost helpless in-

capable of maintaining my prestige of position
death or worse hovered over me my life depended
on regaining my precious garment and its contents
who could have taken it what could have been
their object and instantly the truth flashed upon
my mini it was that rascally high priest he had
seen me take pipe tobacco and matches from my
coat pocket he had watched me narrowly perhaps
had kept his eyes upon me through some hidden
peep-hole or opening and had seen me remove my
coat and while i slept had seized it or perhaps
he had ordered zip to secure it for him it made
little difference which for if it were in his posses-
sion he would have me in his power he could order
me to smoke and when i failed he could perform
the miracle himself and denounce me as an im-
poster my only hope was to regain my possessions
by fair means or foul and knowing that every sec-
ond i delayed increased my peril i rushed to the
ladder and across the roofs to the throne room

  from beneath me as i started to descend came
the sounds of the hissing language in excited tones
and as my head came below the level of the roof
my heart sank the dark air of the room was heavy
with tobacco smoke

  the next instant my feet were jerked from be-
neath me i was seized tumbled on the floor and
before i could strike or rise i was bound hand and
foot dazed startled and helpless i glanced about
surrounding me were a dozen of the repulsive
dwarfs gathered about the sides of the room
were crowds of people and seated upon the throne
puffing great clouds of smoke from my pipe a
wicked leer upon his ugly face and thoroughly
enjoying himself was the priest while beside him
the king coughed and sneezed and looked very miser-
able

  all this i took in at a glance then i was seized
and dragged roughly before the throne i fully
realized my doom was sealed i was no longer a
supernatural being to be feared and adored-my
treatment proved that-but merely a prisoner an
ordinary mortal oddly enough however i was no
longer frightened my first fears had given place
to anger and i raged and fumed and prayed that
the grinning fiend before me might be stricken
with all the torturing sickness which usually fol-
lows the beginners first smoke

  but apparently he was immune to the effects and
as soon as i was dragged before the throne he rose
and pointing at me addressed the crowd before him
that he was denouncing me as an imposter and at
the same time tremendously increasing his own
importance was evident by his tones his gestures
and the expression on his black face moreover he
had another card to play pointing upward and
waving his arm and making quite creditable imita-
tion of an airplanes exhaust he spoke vehemently
and then pointed to a man who crouched on the
dais

  at first i was at a loss to grasp his meaning and
then as the trembling creature beside the throne
spoke in frightened tones and gesticulated vividly i
realized he was the chap i had bumped into upon my
arrival he had spilled the beans and had informed
through the

the old scarecrow of a priest that i had arrived via
the tunnel and not from the sky

  i felt sure now that my doom was sealed but
there was nothing i could do or say there was
one chance in a million that i might be escorted
from the valley and turned loose in the tunnel but
that gave me no comfort for i knew that hideous
certain death awaited me on that slope covered with
the devilish man-eating-trees

  the chances however were all in favor of my
being tortured and butchered strangely enough my
greatest regret the matter which troubled me the
most and made me curse my carelessness in remov-
ing my coat while i slept was not that i should
be killed-i had faced death too often for that-but
the fact that i would be unable to report the wonder-
ful discoveries i had made or give my knowledge of
the city and its people to the world indeed my
thoughts were so concentrated on this that i gave
little attention to the priest until he stepped for-
ward and with a nasty grimace struck me savage-
ly across the face maddened at the blow i lunged
forward like a butting ram my head struck square-
ly in the pit of his stomach and with a gasping
yell he doubled up and fell sprawling on the dais
while the pipe flew from his lips and scattered its
contents far and near before i could roll to one
side myguards seized and pulled me across the
room despite my plight and the fate in store
for me i laughed loudly and heartily as i saw the
priest with hands pressed to stomach eyes rolling
wildly and a sickly greenish pallor on his face the
blow plus the tobacco had done its work i had
evened up the score a bit at any rate

  the next moment i was hauled through a low
doorway hidden by draperies and bumping like
a bag of meal over the rough stones was pitched in-
to an inky black cell- bruised scratched and
bleeding i lay there unable to move or see while
the occasional sounds of shuffling footsteps or
rather handsteps told me a guard was close at hand
for hour after hour i lay motionless expecting each
minute that i would be dragged out to torture or
death and wondering dully what form it would take
until at last-numb exhausted and worn out i lost
consciousness

  i was brought to my senses by being seized and
jerked to a sitting posture and found the cell il-
luminated by a spluttering torch while two of the
men supported my shoulders and a third held a
gourd of water to my lips my throat was parched
and the liquid was most welcome and a moment
later a fourth man appeared with food it was evi-
dent that the priest had no intention of letting me
die of thirst or starvation and i wondered why he
should be so solicitous of my comfort if i were
doomed to an early death

  as soon as i had eaten the guards withdrew tak-
ing the torch and i was once more left in stygian
blackness with my thoughts i wondered whether it
were day or night but i had no means of judging
it had been the middle of the afternoon when i had
missed my coat and reasoning that the food served
was probably the evening meal i decided that it was
now about sundown in that case i should probably
be put out of the way the next morning that

craters rim	

would be a full twenty-four hours before hazen
was due and i wondered what he would think when
he saw no sign of me in the valley-whether he
would surmise that i had not reached the city and
had been killed by the kunas and what he would
report to my friends in colon

  but colon friends and hazen seemed very far
away as i thought of them there in that black hole
awaiting death at the hands of the strange black
dwarfs and as far as any aid they could give me
was concerned i might as well have been in mars

  my thoughts were interrupted by my guards reap-
pearing with the torch lifting me to my feet they
loosened the bonds about my legs and urged me
through a small doorway where i was compelled to
bend low to pass and along a winding narrow low-
ceilinged stone tunnel that i was on my way to
my execution i was sure and vague thoughts of
selling my life dearly and of overpowering my
puny guards crossed my mind but i dismissed
such ideas as useless for even were i to succeed i
would be no better off there were thousands of the
tiny men in the city it was impossible to escape
from the valley unseen and i had not the least idea
where the underground passage led to attempt to
escape meant certain death and there still remained
a faint chance a dim hope that i might yet be
spared and merely deported so ducking my head
and with stooping shoulders i picked ray way along
the tunnel by the fitful glare of the flaming torch

  for what seemed miles the way led on and i
began to think that the entrance was outside the
valley and that i was being led to freedom when
a glimmer of light showed ahead the floor sloped
upward and an instant later i emerged in the open
air

  for a moment my eyes were blinded by the light
after the darkness of the passage and i could not
grasp where i was i had thought it evening but
my first glance told me it was early morning and
i knew the night had passed and another day had
come then as i looked about at my surroundings
and it dawned upon me where i was a shudder of
horror a chill of deadly fear swept over me i was
on the summit of the pyramid the sacrificial altar
was within three paces beside it stood the fiendish
priest and his assistants and gathered upon the
green plain were hordes of people with faces up-
turned towards me i was about to be sacrificed
to be bound fast to the bloodstained awful stone
to have my still-beating heart torn from my living
body

  anything were preferable to that and with a
sudden bound i strove to gain the altars edge and
hurl myself to certain death but to no avail two
of the dwarfs held me fast by the cord which fast-
ened my wrists and i was jerked back to fall heavily
upon the stones before i could struggle up four
of the priests assistants sprang forward and grasp
ing me by legs and shoulders lifted me and tossed
me upon the stinking sacrificial stone i was help-
less and instantly my ankles were tied fast to the
metal staples the bonds of my wrists were severed
my arms were drawn apart and securely lashed to
other staples the stone collar was placed about my
neck forcing my head far back and i was ready


amazing stories

for the glowering priest to wreak his awful venge-
ance

   stepping close to the altar he drew a glittering
obsidian knife-and even in my terrible predica-
ment i noted this and realized that he was adhering
strictly to aztec customs-and raising his arms
he began a wailing blood-curdling chant up
from the thousands of throats below came the chant-
ing chorus rising and falling like a great wave
of sound how long i wondered would this keep
on how much longer must this agony this tor-
ture of suspense be borne why did he not strike
his stone dagger into my chest and have it over
with

  and then from some dormant cell in my brain
came the answer i was to be sacrificed to the sun
god and i remembered that according to the aztec
religion the blow could not be struck until the ris-
ing sun cast its rays upon the victims chest above
the heart the priest was awaiting that moment
he was delaying until the sun still behind the
craters rim should throw its first rays upon me

  how long would it be how many minutes must
pass before the fatal finger of light pointed to my
heart with a mighty effort i turned my head
slightly towards the east above the rugged moun-
tain edge was a blaze of light even as i looked
with aching eyes a golden beam shot across the
valley and flashed blindingly into my face it was
now only a matter of seconds the priest raised his
knife aloft the chant from the multitude ceased
and over city and valley fell an ominous awful
silence upon the sacrificial knife the sun gleamed
brilliantly transforming the glass-like stoae to
burnished gold with his free hand the priest tore
open my shirt and bared my bosom i felt that the
end had come i closed my eyes and then at the
very instant when the knife was about to sweep
down faint and far away like the humming of a
giant bee i caught a sound it was unmistakable
unlike anything else in all the world-the exhaust
of an airplanes engines

  and my straining ears were not the only ones
that heard that note over the priests faee swept
a look of deadly fear the poised knife was slowly
lowered he turned trembling towards the west
and from the waiting throng below rose a mighty
sigh of terror

  a new hope sprang up in my breast was it
hazen he was not due until the next day and it
might be only some army plane that would pass far
to one side of the valley no the sound was in-
creasing the plane was approaching but even
were it hazen would it help me any would he see
my plight and descend or would he fly too far above
the city to note what was taking place for a space
my life was saved the fear of that giant roaring
bird would prevent the sacrifice the priest feared
 he had made a mistake that i urns a god that from
the sky vengeance would swoop upon him and his
people for the contemplated butchery but if the
plane passed or would his dread of it be greater
than his fear of defying the sun god by failing in
the sacrifice

   now the roar of the motor bounded direetly over-
head and the next moment i glimpsed the plane

speeding across the blue morning sky then it was
gone the exhaust grew fainter and fainter all
hope was lost whoever it was had flown on all un-
suspecting the awful fate of a fellow man upon that
sunlit pyramid

  and now the priest was again towering over me
once more he raised his knife i could feel the
warm sun beating upon my throat and shoulders
i could feel it creeping slowly but surely down-
ward the knife quivered in the impatient hand of
the priest i saw his muscles tense themselves for
the blow i caught the grim smile that flitted across
his face as he prepared to strike

  an instant more and my palpitating heart would
be held aloft for all to see

  but the blow never fell with a deafening roar
that drowned the mighty shout of terror from the
people the airplane swooped like an eagle from the
sky and clove the air within a hundred feet of the
altar with a gurgling cry the priest flung himself
face down and his knife fell clattering with the
sound of broken glass upon the stones

 was it hazen would he see me would he
alight was i saved

  the answer was a thunderous fear maddened cry
from below a swishing whirr as of a gale of wind
and a dark shadow sweeping over me

  and then my overwrought senses my frazzled
nerves could stand no more and all went black be-
fore my eyes

  dimly consciousness came back i heard the
sounds of rushing feet the panting labored breaths
of men sharp half uttered exclamations and
grunting noises then a shrill scream of mortal
terror and a deep drawn sigh of relief above my
wondering eyes a figure suddenly loomed a weird
uncanny figure with strangely smooth and rounded
head and great goggling glassy eyes with a jerk
the stone collar was lifted from my strained neck
and as full consciousness came back i gasped it
was hazen by some miracle he was ahead of time

  from somewhere muffled behind that grotesque
mask came a hoarse my god are you hurt

  before i could speak the bonds were slashed
from my ankles and wrists a strong arm raised
me and pulled me from the slab

  for gods sake hurry cried hazen as half
supporting me he rushed toward the altar stairs
ive got em buffaloed for a minute but the lord
alone knows how long itll hold em

  rapidly as my numbed limbs would permit i
rushed down the sloping spiral way half carried
by hazen i raced across the few yards of grass
between the base of the pyramid and the plane and
as i did so i caught a fleeting glimpse of a hud-
dled shapeless bloodly bundle of green and white
it was all that remained of the priest whom hazen
had hurled from the altar top

  the next moment i was in the plane and hazen
was twirling the propeller there was a roar as
the motor started hazen leaped like an acrobat
to his seat and slowly the machine moved across
the plain

  everywhere the people wee prostrate but as
the machine started forward one after another
glanced up ere we had traveled a score of yards
through the craters rim



the creatures were rising and with frightful screams
were scattering from our pathway it was impos-
sible to avoid them with sickening shocks the
whirring propeller struck one after another blood
spattered our faces and becrimsoned the windshield
and the wings but uninjured the plane gathered
headway the uneven bumping over the ground
ceased we were traveling smoothly lifting from
the earth

  then with a strange wild roar the people rushed
for us racing on their hands they came rocks
and missiles whizzed about us an arrow whirred
by my head and struck quivering in a strut but
now we were rising rapidly we were looking down
upon the maddened hosts their arrows and sling-
flung stones were striking the under surface of the
fuselage and wings we were safe at last a mo-
ment more and we would be above the crater rim

  a sudden exclamation from hazen startled me

i glanced up straight ahead rose the precipitous
mountain side above the quarry to clear it we
must ascend far more rapidly than we were doing

  must have splintered the blades jerked out
hazen shes not making it cant swing her
rudders jammed heave out everything you can
find hurry or well smash

  before us loomed the ragged rocky wall we
were rushing to our doom at lightning speed at
hazens words i grasped whatever i could find and
tossed it over the side a box of provisions a roll
of tools a leather jacket a thermos bottle canteens
an automatic pistol and a cartridge belt all went
i glanced up we were rising faster a few
pounds more overboard a few feet higher and we
would be clear was there anything else i could
throw out frantically i searched i saw a can-
like object resting on a frame spare gasoline i
decided but fuel was of no value now with an
effort i dragged it out i lifted it and hurled it
over

  with a sudden jerk the plane sprung upward
there was a terrific muffled roar from below and
with barely a yard to spare we rose above the
crater rim

  lord you must have dropped that old bomb
cried hazen the concussion jarred the rudder
free

the

   i glanced over the side far beneath a cloud of
 smoke and dust was drifting slowly aside exposing
 the aqueduct broken smashed and in ruins from
 the opening in the mountain side a mighty stream
 of water was roaring in a rushing tearing torrent
 the bomb had landed squarely in the quarry the
 aqueduct had fallen the shock had let loose the
 gates of the lake and the whole vast crater re-
 servoir was pouring in a mighty flood across the
 valley

   in a wide arc hazen swung the plane about
 poor devils he muttered as we soared above the
 doomed city

   already the green plain was shimmering with
 the glint of water we could see the frantic fren-
 zied people running and scrambling up their lad-
 ders again we wheeled and circled far above them
 and now only the roof tops of the houses were
 above the flood presently these too sank from sight
 and above the sunlit waters only the sacrificial
 stone remained

   its all over exclaimed hazen and heading
 northward we sped beyond the encircling mountain
 sides

   beneath us now was forest and with a shudder
 i recognized it as that death-dealing nightmare
 grove of cannibal trees fascinated i gazed down
 and suddenly from the mountain side behind us
 burst a frothing yellow torrent the pressure of
 the flood had been too great the overwhelming
 waters had forced the stone door of the tunnel by
 which i had entered that incredible valley before
 my wondering eyes the devastating deluge swept
 down the slope i saw the monstrous trees shiver
 and sway and crash before the irresistible force
 they gave way and like matchsticks went tossing
 tumbling bobbing down the hillside

   higher and higher we rose the water-filled
 crater was now but a silvery lake the slope up
 which i had fought and raced from the ravenous
 blood-sucking trees was bare red earth scarred
 deep by the plunging stream that flowed over it
 far to the west gleamed the blue pacific like a
 vast map darien was spread below us northward
 we sped before us was civilization behind us
 death and destruction the man-eating trees were
 a thing of the past the lost city was lost forever

     this is without a doubt the best story on man-made invisibility that has ever been
presented suppose we suddenly could make ourselves totally invisible what would
happen and how can it be accomplished and is it possible to ever devise means
whereby it can be effected personally we believe it can and in this story mr verrill
gives us excellent science ol how it will be done but the story contains not only good
science but gives us a real insight into what will happen when we finally do it dont

the lord of the winds



a puzzling companion

companion had three peculiarities that
puzzled me the first was the sharp
contrast between his refined manners
and his shabby outfit which made me
suspect he was not an ordinary prospec-
tor any more than i although he surely seemed to
feel more comfortable in those clothes and in such
a place it entered my mind that his disguise had
the same purpose as mine-and that we were both
engaged in the same adventure such a possibility
both amused and irritated me

  i watched him swinging from one side of the
saddle to the other as his horse just ahead of mine
cautiously went down the dangerous slope

  his second peculiarity was the sack bound to his
back this sack was small but heavy as i judged
from the effort he displayed now and then in ar-
ranging it on his shoulders what puzzled me was
the fact that he carried this burden on his back
when he could easily have tied it to the saddle

  his third peculiarity which had been first to
strike me was his remarkably long upper lip i was
sure i had seen that gorilla lip once before but
where and when

  we had met a couple of miles from rhyolite
there i had exchanged my automobile for a horse-
not because a motor car would have failed to travel
the sixteen miles of boundary canyon from the
summit of the funeral range down to the desert
valley but because a horse was more suitable to
my disguise finding that we were bound to the
same place we had agreed to travel together

  when we reached hole-in-the-rock a little
spring making its way out of the canyon we dis-
mounted to water the horses and refill our canteens
then we sat down to rest awhile on a malapais
boulder shaded by a giant cactus

  rweve been riding two
hours he said looking at
his watch

an old acquaintance

his watch had a fob
and the fob carried a
pendant with the emblem
of a fraternal lodge

  there flashed across my
memory a name

is your name wells

i asked

  yes he answered in
amazement how do you
know

  three years ago i went
for a week from san francisco to los angeles one
night i visited your lodge you were one of the
two appointed to examine my credentials and give
me the ritual examination before i could gain en-
trance

you are right and he shook my hand cordially

  as soon as he was satisfied that he could trust
me wells became so communicative that his bag
ceased to be a mystery he said with a smile

  if i had told you that i was a prospector a gold
hunter when you saw me in my evening dress at the
lodge you would have doubted me

  it is true my idea of a miner is somewhat dif-
ferent

  well he explained mining for me is a sport
a hobby a passion california has gold in every
hill once a man gets a glance at the yellow stuff in
the bottom of the pan he is a miner for life the
gold mania gets more of a grip on the mind than
does alcohol or morphine

   at times id return to the city-to the real estate
business but presently my old passion would master
me again i would find myself roaming in these
mountains searching thinking hoping dreaming
nothing but gold gold gold but this time thank
god i can quit for good

  lost your courage

  no i made a find

  gold vein

  no gems-rubies-just look

a bag-full of great rubies

he unstrapped his bag from his shoulders placed
it on his lap and opened it showing the con-
tents i saw a quantity of stones both large and
small wells picked out two of the largest stones
each as big as an egg

  you see these these two alone may be worth
 altogether in this bag i think i have
more than 

  is that possible i returned with an accent
that betrayed my skepticism

  do you know anything about gems he asked

  i confessed that i did not

  well i do and rubies are rarer than diamonds
the largest imported into this country do not reach
the size of the smallest one in this bag

  of course when they are faceted and polished
they will be much more brilliant but look at this
one as it is he held a large stone against the light

close to my eyes you
will never find other
rubies so transparent and
of a red so rich

-i expressed my admira-
tion and you said the
value of this collection
is-

  at least 
maybe twice as much-
this sack contains my for-
tune

  but why do you carry
it on your shoulders it
must be heavy

 heavy say did you
ever hear a mother say
her baby was heavy i love to feel the weight
against my back besides it is safer this bag
has not left my shoulders for three days not even
during my sleep and it shant until i reach my home
in los angeles

  but you are going in a quite different direction
  i am doing that to see professor matheson
  the lord of the winds

  thats what they call him he knows more
geology than any one else in the world i want to
see what he thinks of these stones of mine bat
why do you took at me like that

 tr centuries we have had with vs all sorts of weath-
 jt er makersbut only during the last few decades has
 science actually begun to get some vague results in arti-
 ficially creating rain or sunshine in england they are ex-
 perimenting at present with a machine to disperse fog
 in california extensive experiments have been made to
 produce rain by sending electrically-charged kites or bal-
 loons aloft and the dispersion of clouds by electrified
 sand has had some success

    in this interesting story a novel scheme has been woven
 -not at all impossible from a scientific standpoint who
 knows that at some future date a scheme such as devel-
 oped here may not come about to serve humanity you
 can not fail to be interested in this story


amazing stories

  wells could not understand my sodden exaltation
mixed with surprise

  you know professor matheson well i asked
  yes why

  since you have trusted me by showing your
treasure i will tell you my secret i am only dis-
guised as a prospector

  i knew it wells rejoined laughing

a newspaper man disguised

i ftm a newspaper man working for the san fran-
j cisco tribune on my way to get an interview
with professor matheson

  you might as well say that you are going to
interview your horse

  i know it no reporter ever got a word from
him and for these last six months no reporter has
been able even to approach him

  do you blame him after they have all called him
a lunatic

  the press of this country was in his favor till
sir oliver lodge in london and professor brillouin
in paris almost at the same time declared that
mathesons theories were wrong

  i stake my rubies he is not

  perhaps not but you will agree with me that
mathesons claims are of such stupendous magni-
tude as to stagger the wildest imagination
yes but thats no reason why he should be
ridiculed they should wait at least until the ex-
periments are over

  well some papers take his side my paper for
instance but nevertheless when one of our editors
tried to have a talk with him all he could get from
him was facts will convince more than words
so when it became known that the experiments were
going to start in a few days i asked leave to attempt
the impossible-to interview the unapproachable
matheson the interest of the public is intense
but to tell you the truth i have no definite plans
of attack i am just relying on luck

  you can rely on me wells promised smiling
mounting our horses we continued our descent
into the canyon the sun had set a dark orange
disc in a sea of pulverized gold in the narrow strip
of skies that the deep canyon permitted me to see
some stars began to twinkle and the summits of the
high cliffs in shadowy outline assumed fantastic
shapes

  what is your scheme i inquired keeping my
horse close to wells

  a very simple one-you are my partner we
found the treasure together and come to him together
for advice i will make him talk about his inven-
tion also and you will listen and note

  every word of the conversation to-morrow will
be wired to my paper meanwhile i wish you would
tell me all you know about him

        a wonderful project and its creator
cct doubt wells said if i know more than
-i has already been published in the papers
they have even printed his picture several times
but it does not look like him yon must see that
iittle fellows eyes like electric sparks brilliant rest-
less and irresistible he must be fifty but there
are times when he looks twenty-five i happened
to be there two months ago when his three hundred

men were erecting the steel towers that you will see
as we reach the desert valley you should have
seen him i doubt if he weighs  pounds whisk-
ers and all but he showed the energy of a giant
he was everywhere giving commands like a general
and when you see what has been done there in less
than a year you will marvel at the prodigy of that
wizard

  he must have overcome great difficulties
great look at this road if we may call it that
over it matheson had sixteen motor trucks going
back and forth from rhyolite to wind city as they
call his works in the valley he transported more
than three thousand tons of steel bars seventy-five
tons of cement two tons of copper wire lumber for
twenty-five bungalows provisions and tools a thou-
sand other things then he had a water pipe laid
from the ermite mine to windville

  but why did he come to this forsaken place so
difficult to reach

  i never asked him but i imagine he needed a
place where the air would be still for long periods
of time also perhaps a region quite deserted
imagine the expense

  ive heard there are more than two million dol-
lars invested in this-which is but an experiment in
diminutive proportions

  two million dollars for an experiment is a proof
of strong faith on the part of the stockholders
there are no stockholders wells declared one
man has financed matheson-a multi-millionaire

  i surely remember having read of a tremendous
corporation behind matheson

  yes i understand that if these trials prove the
soundness of the idea the largest corporation that
the world has ever known will invest some billions of
dollars to put the scheme into action enough
money to buy all the railroad lines and the panama
canal with plenty left over to buy the united
states navy but they say it will be the best in-
vestment any country can make matheson claims
he will transform the whole globe producing more
real wealth than all the worlds industries

  dont forget the opinion of sir oliver lodge and
the two great meteorologists

  their skepticism will have an interesting set
back im sure before the week is over look
there is the ermite mine

      a one-man mine and its strange owner
  could not see any signs of a camp

    is it really a mine i inquii-ed

  yes a mine that has no equal in the world-a
one-man mine you will be interested to see this
man davy-the hermit as they usually call him
tall and massive as one of these boulders he has
a neck as large as my horses neck and eyebrows
so black and thick that you cannot see his eyes he
lives alone in his mine a gold mine that he dis-
covered six years ago he operates it himself with
only the aid of a mule

  a rich mine

  very poor ground he tried to sell it several
times nobody would give him enough so he thought
that he would exploit it himself he has been liv-
ing here these six years and he has done wonders
should you pass this way in the daytime you would
see what a lone man can do he has bored two
the lord of the winds	

tunnels and constructed a mining plant that crushes
two tons of rocks daily of course the whole outfit
is the simplest that one can imagine once a month
he goes to town with his mule to deposit his little
treasure and to get provisions for another month

  does he make much

  nobody knows but im sure he makes very little
out of it he told me once that his idea was to get
enough money to operate the mine on a larger scale
with modern machinery but i wonder how long he
will have to wait he is more than fifty now

  and isnt he afraid of keeping gold in this soli-
tude

  the hermit afraid wait until you see him

  by this time we had left the main road and taken
to a narrow path at the left of the canyon which
ascended a slight hill when he had gone a hun-
dred yards wells shouted davy and stopped his
horse he repeated his call a voice very near us
answered hello there my eye spotted the sil-
houette of a man in front of a hut

  i remember little of the few minutes that we spent
in that small bare one-room cabin faintly illumin-
ated by a sooty lamp about the man i remember
only his eyes the eyes that wells found hard to
see under those thick eyebrows i always scoffed
at such things as presentment but those savage
rapacious eyes had a sinister meaning to me

  i remembered afterward that when wells in a
general way asserted that he had struck rich the
eyes of the hermit assumed a strange expression
fearful and repulsive of this much i was certain
then his attention was abnormally attracted by the
sack on wells back	

  the hermit insisted that we spend the night with
him but we declined

  thanks old man said wells we must hustle
along we have chosen this time of day to escape
the heat and expect to reach the valley by nine
oclock my friend will start back by twelve it
is moonlight tonight and by five he will be in
rhyolite again i will sleep in camp in the stone
house

  where the machinery is inquired the hermit

  yes one of the overseers who has his bed there
is away tonight

  we bade the hermit good-bye he did not an-
swer

first view of the great station

half an hour later we were out of the canyon
the valley appeared before us the moon was
high and its glowinundated the plain transforming
it into an ocean of dead calmness wells pointed
toward the north a tower as slim as the steeple
of a gothic church rose against the sky to a great
height

  during my journalistic career i have had to cover
many exciting stories filled with pathos or danger
but never have i been so thrilled as when i stopped
my horse for a minute to gaze at that shadowy
tower i felt sure that i was going to witness a
prodigious achievement which for its arduousness
its gigantic possibilities and its sublimity had no
equal in the history of the world i exulted over
the opportunity that was so soon to be mine-to
meet the man who by the power of his genius was
going to transform the earth almost like a god

  as we came nearer i distinguished other con-
structions besides the tower there were five or
six houses of different shapes and dimensions one
of them was lighted toward that one wells went
i examined the tower as carefully as i could in the
scanty light of the moon it was a skeleton tower
of steel bars built on a massive concrete base that
covered a surface about four hundred feet square
tapering as the height increased it ended almost
in a point supporting a large sphere which by the
way it reflected the rays of the moon appeared to be
made of glass innumerable wire cables parting
from the tower at regular intervals and fastened
to the ground insured the stability of the construc-
tion which i judged to be fully five hundred feet
high

  some workl i exclaimed in admiration

  yes when you think that they built thirty of
these spikes in the valley see another one over
there

  i discerned a couple of miles away a narrow
shadow rising from the flat horizon brilliant at its
extremity like a lighthouse in the ocean

  we did not need to rap at the door of the one
story house it was open as were all the windows
we went in to find ourselves face to face with pro-
fessor matheson

  his personality did not lend itself to a picturesque
description he had the ordinary appearance of a
middle aged man with a calm and cheerful face as
if he had never been troubled by any problem but
i had not been five minutes in the room before i
realized that i was in the presence of an extraordi-
nary man

  wells made his introduction as planned mention-
ing me as his partner then without delay he put
into the hands of the professor two of the largest
gems of his collection

  meanwhile i looked around the spacious room
illuminated by two electric lights the confusion
the multitude and the variety of the objects scat-
tered about made of that place a strange combina-
tion of library draughting room work-shop mu-
seum laboratory and storehouse a wooden parti-
tion separated the room from the other part of the
building accessible through a large doorway which
was wide open desirous of finding out what the
next room contained i gradually reached the door-
way and looked inside the place was dark but the
moonlight entering through the open window al-
lowed me to see that the floor was covered with
boxes all of one dimension three feet long by two
feet wide placed six inches apart and each con-
nected to the next by wires the boxes were placed
in parallel rows with room enough for a person to
step between the rows i figured that there must
be fully forty boxes in each row-in all more than
one thousand boxes i could not see anything else
in that vast room

examining the rubies-explanations of the project

my conjectures did not lead me to any plausible
explanation of the nature of what i was seeing
so i turned to the two men who were still talking
about the precious stones

  the professor was holding one against the bulb
of the electric light


amazing stories

  these are star rubies he said with profound
conviction see the aster ism that is so marked
in this stone it is produced by crystals of extreme
minuteness parallel to the crystalline axis i know
of only two other rubies as nearly perfect as this
one but they are not so large one is a bohemian
ruby preserved in the imperial treasury at vienna
the other one is in dresden

  then you really believe i have something valu-
able asked wells

  something of a remarkable value i am sure
said the other adding to the words a vigorous shake
of his head

  hurrah exclaimed wells and picked from his
bag a stone of medium size which he offered to the
professor who thanked him warmly

  i shall be glad to keep it as a rare specimen
he concluded and speaking of gems you will be
interested in seeing a beautiful tourmaline that one
of my men found while digging for the foundation
of the tower

  where is it wells inquired

  in the third building where two of my men
have made their quarters i will take you there
very likely they are all in by this time and he
started for the door

  he had not reached the middle of the room when
i inquired with a voice that i strove to make indif-
ferent would you mind professor telling me what
you keep in that room the look that wells sent
me clearly indicated that i was guilty of a serious
imprudence but the professor turned his head
smiling

  those are the batteries the electric batteries
that will furnish the current to the thirty towers

  and instead of proceeding toward the door he
walked back to the partition turned a switch and
illuminated the second room i noticed then some-
thing i had not seen before that room besides
the rows of boxes contained a very large bench to
which the wires of the batteries ran and which had
a number of electrometers and two very conspicuous
switches i noticed also and this detail had the
most important bearing on the events that succeeded
that the bench ran along the wall directly under
the open window

  over there you shift the electric current i
asked

  right answered the professor and he smiled
again at my curiosity

  a hundred questions crowded my mind at once
but wells came to my rescue seeing that the pro-
fessor was unusually communicative he thought the
time was at hand to try the effect of the story he
had concocted for my benefit

  professor he began endeavoring to make his
voice sound indifferent i wish you would tell my
friend something about your work i explained it
all to him but i must have done a poor job because
he couldnt make head or tail of my account you
can go into details because he has some education
he went to college before the mining bug got him
am i right pal

  i answered with a nod i was so anxious about
the professors reaction that i could not utter a
word

  wells noticed my confusion to save the situa-
tion he added

the project is explained by the inventor

vf course there is one thing he has understood
w -that you are the greatest genius of this and
of any other generation and that your invention is

the most astonishing thing-

  now now interrupted the professor laughing
at the earnestness of wells enthusiasm let us
not exaggerate i have found nothing new i have
only applied old and well known discoveries to a
practical and useful purpose then addressing
himself to me young man do you know much
about roentgen rays

  did i know before starting on my adventure i
had gone through all the books that could enlighten
me on the subject of professor mathesons inven-
tion but i answered hesitatingly

  well i remember they are produced by an elec-
trical discharge passed through a tube from which
the air has been exhausted

  exactly now i have found a new application
of these rays i have found a practical way of elec-
trifying the air of a vast area with a single tube
which does not differ much from the one introduced
by porter there is nothing essentially new in my
invention

  professor you are too modest interrupted
wells

  i am telling you the truth and i can prove it
come over here and i will show you something
we returned to the front room the professor
directed our attention to two spherical glasses of
about six inches in diameter and four feet apart
mounted on pedestals

  these are the miniatures of the apparatus that
i have placed in the towers-nothing but a porter
tube with one or two changes as you can see the
cathode is the same a segment of a hollow sphere
the anti-cathode is also connected with the anode
but instead of platinum or tantalum i use a compo-
sition of my invention which is not affected by the
extreme heat of the discharge the tube instead
of being exhausted as usual contains a gaseous sub-
stance about which i keep silent and the common
induction coil with a mercery interrupter produces
the discharge the usual ionization of a gas is due
to the splitting up of some of the atoms of that gas
resulting in the detachment of electrons constituents
of the atoms each electron carries a constant nega-
tive charge while the part of the atom that is left
behaves like a positive ion with the units charged
positively but with a mass that is large compared
with that of the negative ions do you follow me
tes i answered while wells stared at me to
find out if i meant it

  perhaps my yes was not as convincing as it
could have been even the professor seemed to have
noticed this

the artificial production and control of winds

uttou may not be up to date in the recent re-
x searches in this field he resumed but i
can tell you now in one word what my application
is one of these tubes ionizes the surrounding air
and the positive nuclei are attracted by the second
tube which ionizes the air not with a smaller but
with a larger proportion of negative electrons that
is absolutely all
the lord of the winds



  the professor stopped as if he had finished i
looked at him in suspense and wells kept staring
at the professor and at me with evident confusion
at length wells spoke

  but what about the winds 

   here place your hand here said the inventor
holding the hand of the miner at the level of the
roentgen tubes and midway between them

  the professor turned a switch on the table a
bluish glare appeared in both tubes sparkling
dancing while the crisp short discharges sounded
in rapid succession wells pulled out his hand
brusquely

   i feel a breeze he exclaimed

  i placed my hand where he had held hia and i
too felt a gentle breeze blowing against my palm

   it is the air electrified by the tube on the left
and violently attracted by the tube on the right ex-
plained the professor here is the basis of my
invention

  and the towers you have erected

  they serve to produce this same experiment on
a larger scale each tower supports a roentgen
tube large enough to ionize the air within a radius
of two miles if my calculations are correct

  and what do you intend to do with them i
asked

  i want to try their maximum efficiency i have
erected thirty towers in this desert at two mile
intervals covering thus fifty-eight miles in a
straight line across the plains

  is the work all done

  yes it was completed a week ago but we have
had to delay our test until everything and everybody
are out of the way we shall have to demolish all
the huts we have built for the workmen all the
small houses you have seen around here except this
one that has been purposely built with massive stone
walls and low roof you see i must take every pre-
caution because it is hard to foresee the velocity of
the wind that will be produced during the trials in
a couple of days more all will be cleared away and
all the men and animals will go to a safe place in
the canyons i will remain here with carter my
chief engineer and will begin the tests

  do you need anybody at the towers 

  no i have absolute control of them from this
house-from that bench in the next room

  we went again into the room of the storage bat-
teries and i saw again the bench under the open
window

    the mystery explained-what wind can do
ccx-u see these switches asked the professor
x pointing to the bench with these i regu-
late the discharge to all the towers

   and why are you doing all this i asked

  to produce wind of course

  wind

   yea

   you dont expect to sell wind do you

   i surely do

  god knows there is plenty of free wind in the
world

  yes but not always the kind of wind you want
nor when you want it if the trials i am going
to start here in a couple of days are successful as
i am sure they will be in five years time the whole

united states will be thickly dotted with my towers
in lines that will run in all directions from the
atlantic to the pacific from canada to mexico in
innumerable parallel rows that will cover the whole
country-and eventually will cover all the other con-
tinents and the whole globe from the poles to the
equator

  just to make wind

  yes to produce winds artificially

  for any practical good

  for the greatest good that man ever dreamed
exclaimed the inventor sweeping the air with both
extended arms and smiling triumphantly then he
resumed when i succeed in forcing at will a cur-
rent of air from any place to any place i shall have
under my control the winds and with the winds the
clouds and with the clouds the rain do you see
now i will regulate the seasons i will regulate
the climates do you know what that means it
means transforming the earth into a veritable para-
dise i will make cold regions warm pumping hot
winds from the south and i will make hot places
cool sending fresh air from the north the tem-
perature will be made even throughout the year
yuma in arizona will not roast any more at 
degrees in the shade and havre in montana will not
freeze at  degrees below zero

  but there is more than temperature do you
know how many people in our country in the orient
in africa some everywhere suffer unspeakable tor-
tures for the lack of a little water and with dried
throats pray for months for a cloud from the burn-
ing skies-and when at last the cloud blessed as a
deliverer rises in the horizon and the rain comes
the little water gathered with great care in wells
in hides in vases hot muddy noisome and full of
microbes will have to last god knows how long
those people will cease to suffer a telegram to my
central meteorologic office will cause me to send them
from the north all the rain they needand when they
have enough another telegram-and the clouds will
be pumped back and the skies will be clear again

 weather and temperature supplied to order

utll tell you what you can do professor in-
i terrupted wells in the summer when the
people of new york chicago boston and philadel-
phia are prostrated by the heat you ask them how
much they will be willing to give you for every nice
cool day do the same when the thermometer is
going below zero and you will get your expenses
back in less than a year and pile up a fortune
besides

  there is something in that i said but pro- 
fessor have you figured out what will be the coat
of installing your towers everywhere

  no not with accuracy but i estimate that for
the united states alone it will be necessary to in-
vest about two billion dollars

  two thousand millions it is enormous

  it is but look here young man do you know
the amount of farm produce of this country eight
and one-half billion dollars a year i can double
that amount i can more than double the fertility
of the country even considering the land that is
now being cultivated have you an idea of the eco-
nomic values of a normal season last year on


amazing stories

account of abnormal weather-with frosts in april
and no rain in june and july-the crops were cut
practically in two with a tremendous loss yes
the installation of my towers will require a huge
capital but it will pay it will pay not in com-
fort and crops alone but it will pay in other ways
besides when siberia as well as the sahara de-
sert and congo as well as alaska have perpetual
spring and the peoples of the earth find in the
tilling of the soil where they were born a sure un-
failing source of wealth and the differences of
climates and products are eliminated we will see
the disappearance of all the other differences that
separate nations from nations and all men saved
from famine and strife will hasten in harmony on
the road of a glorious progress

  good i wells and i exclaimed

  and at last we shall realize the dream of all
ages wars will be made impossible all the na-
tions will have to obey the verdicts of the interna-
tional supreme court and no people will dare to
rebel they would have to face my wrath do
not smile gentlemen think how the winds in my
hands may become weapons the most dreadful
weapons the gentle breeze if i choose may be
turned into a violent storm and the beneficent
rain if i wish may become a deluge woe to that
nation that will dare disturb universal peace i
will thrust upon them with full force my means of
destruction against which whole armies will be
powerless-the hurricane

  you will be mightier than a king i exclaimed

the earth his kingdom by his power over the air

ccxres because my kingdom the air covering
 x all the kingdoms of the earth will be as
vast as the earth

  the inventor said these words calmly with his
perpetual smile but the expression of his eyes re-
vealed how well he appreciated the full significance
of that assertion

  are you sure the apparatus will work i in-
quired

  i am positive of it what i am not certain
about is the degree of power that it will develop
you see the problem consists not only in originat-
ing the winds but also in fighting back the winds
that formed by the difference of atmospheric pres-
sures may be contrary to my pre-arranged plan
we must be able to develop a current strong enough
to win the strongest winds

  that is to say

in st paul minnesota there has been recorded
a wind of the velocity of  miles an hour the maxi-
mum observed in this country i expect to reach
and surpass that speed if everything goes well
that is a terrific speed said wells

  and the effects are in proportion added the
inventor the pressure of a hurricane of 
miles an hour is  pounds per square foot you
understand now why i have chosen this desert place
for my experiments and why i must wait to begin
the tests until all the wooden houses built by my
helpers are demolished and men and animals sent
to a safe distance

  professor i ventured with some hesitancy i
had planned to go back tonight but if you would

let me i should like to stay and see your towers
work

  i have no objections but i warn you there may
be some risk and you must take upon yourself all
the responsibility

  i will i assented with enthusiasm

  now professor interrupted wells you have
satisfied my friends curiosity i wish you would
satisfy mine

  oh about the tourmaline that i told you an-
drews keeps in his cabin

  yes

  well let us go there it is just half past nine
andrews must be in perhaps he is in bed already

  we turned off all the lights and went out the
night was balmy the air still and the moon high in
the sky

  andrews cabin was only fifty to sixty steps from
the stone house nobody was in

  i know where he keeps that stone said the
professor come in gentlemen

  we entered the cabin was not more than nine
feet square and the slanting roof was so low that
i could almost reach it with my outstretched arm

  as we entered the professor proved his fami-
liarity with the place by finding the electric switch
in the dark

  the powerful batteries we have stored he ex-
plained allow us the luxury of a good light i
will find the tourmaline for you mr wells

a catastrophe-disaster at large

phe inventor had scarcely ended his sentence
when a sudden roaring noise broke the still-
ness of the night the sound clearly resembled the
coming of a mighty storm we looked at one an-
other in great astonishment the wind was blow-
ing against the back of the cabin with violence
we had to shout at the top of our voices to be
heard

  we went to the door looked outside

  the professor pointed into the air the summit
of the tower was illuminated the large glass
globe was glittering with green and blue sparks

  i looked at the professor and trembled i had
never before seen a like expression of stupor and
dismay he held his head with both hands-then
as if struck by a sudden idea he made for the open
i caught him by his coat and pulled him back

  it is folly to go out i yelled but i could not
hear my own voice as the wind increasing in
violence had increased its roaring

  the professor turning quickly struck me a
powerful blow in the chest then freeing his coat
from my grip leaped toward the stone house

  the inventor perishes in the wind of his creation

what i had expected happened the ill-fated
man had scarcely taken ten steps when once
out of protection of the shielding cabin he was
seized by the wind and thrown to the ground
there he struggled frantically while the wind
rolled knocked and tossed him a little farther
on i saw him stop perhaps he had succeeded in
getting hold of some rock protruding from the
sand i saw him rising again and then the moon
was so bright that i could distinguish everything
he was lifted bodily from the ground as if he
the lord of the winds



had been a rag and blown along with such vio-
lence that his body struck the wall of the stone
house with a terrific impact

  i closed my eyes in horror but presently i real-
ized the danger that i too was facing the cabin
was about to be smashed the boards were coming
apart evidently wells shared my fears

  what were we to do

  i quickly analyzed the situation if the towers
were in action the electric power of the storage
batteries must have been turned on by something
or somebody the breaking of the current would
stop that cyclone and save us from destruction

  but how could we reach the stone house to open
the switches when a sally from the cabin meant
sure death

  as if he had read that fearful question in my
mind wells answered it in an unexpected way he
grabbed a rope lying in a corner and showed it to
me to talk was useless so he acted first he
counted the rope by arm lengths i counted at the
same time and figured out that there were fully
 yards of strong rope more than the distance from
the cabin to the stone house

  then with gestures wells asked me to tie one
end of the rope around his body under his shoul-
ders as he could not do it himself because of his
inseparable sack of precious gems to the knots i
made wells added one more then took the other
end of the rope passed it around one of the main
supporting posts of the hut pulled until all the
rope had passed through and handed it to me

  his plan was clear securely tied he would ven-
ture outside and i would let the rope slide easily
until he could reach the stone house

  he lay on the ground face down and moving
like a turtle began his perilous journey i seated
myself on the floor my back to the door my feet
against the boards of the wall my hands holding
the rope

a ray of hope but no more

this unexpected chance of salvation gave me
such joy that i heard no more of the rushing of
the hurricane nor the cracking of the cabin all
my attention was concentrated on my task of let-
ting the rope slide out inch by inch

  of a sudden there was a tremendous crash and
i found myself lying on my back with the moon-
light shining in my face the cabin had gone the
rope had slipped out of my hands

  when i recovered from my stupor i wondered
at two things-why i had not been hurt when the
cabin went to pieces and why i was still in the
same place not the prey of the devastating wind

  i explained the first by a mere miracle-and the
second by looking in the direction of my feet the
sand blown up in great quantity by the wind had
gathered against the back of the cabin and now
that the cabin was gone this sand formed a dune
nine feet long and two feet high which shielded me
from the full force of the hurricane

  i decided to take a still safer position crawling
on my back i placed myself lengthwise close to
the dune now i could see the tower and the
stone house but of the half dozen huts i saw
not a sign

  i was by no means at ease the shelter was un-
comfortable and not fully reassuring but i could
do nothing except wait for that inferno to come to
a stop

  the batteries will become exhausted sooner or
later i said to myself but when in an hour
in a day or in a week

  with horror i soon discovered the presence of a
more imminent danger i should say two dangers
one as deadly as the other i discovez-ed that the
height of the little hill of sand was gradually be-
coming lower and that the time was not far off
when it would become so low that the wind could
get its mighty grip on my body

  i discovered also that the sand carried in large
clouds by the tornado was accumulating in the hol-
low where i lay and threatened to cover me of
course i was greatly frightened yet my mind wa
clear and strange as it may sound i immediately
began to calculate which of the two deaths would
get me first-to be buried alive in the sand or to
be caught by the wind and smashed against the
walls of the stone house i even tried to speculate
which of the two was less terrible

  the hurricane now held full sway it seemed
that the whole earth was trembling the roaring
and shrilling and shrieking lacerated my ears it
was like the thundering of a hundred tempests over
an infuriated ocean or the crashing of a cataract
a thousand times larger than niagara

  now and then i even seemed to distinguish some
special sounds in that unbelievable noise yes
there was the discordant dissonance of a million
violins and cellos played in seven different keys
and accompanied by a gigantic organ with all the
pipes wide open and then it sounded like the
moaning of infinite herds caught in a forest fire
and the screams and groans of distress of all the
mobs of the world threatened by unavoidable de-
struction

the wind bridled and wreaking destruction

but above all this i heard the enraged voices of
the wind-of the wind that free since the
beginning of creation free to roam over the im-
mensities of the seas free to dominate over the
wild forests free to speed over the boundless
deserts and over the mountain peaks free to come
and go in the infinite vastness of the earth was
feeling now for the first time the touch of the bridle
suddenly imposed by the genius of man and with
desperate convulsions was in vain rebelling against
that conquering power

  my god its revolt was horrible beyond words
what was passing above my head i could not
be mistaken those were bodies of men of horses
and cattle some tumbling to the ground and rising
up again in clouds of sand then fast disappearing
from my sight

  strange as it may seem even in the agitation
of all my nerves the magnitude and horror of that
scene brought some verses to my memory i was
viewing what dante saw in the second circle of
the inferno while he was witnessing the punish-
ment of carnal sinners where

 samuel cm- sanjentjr 

there sounded a wild scream dr spaulding leaped upon the machine gibbering incoherently and smashed the mechanism into

thousand pieces
the telepathic pick-up



here was a strange light in doctor
spauldings eyes his face was im-
mobile but the lines were set in an
expression of jubilance and triumph
come on brant he said quietly i
have something interesting to show you

  with that remark he wheeled and strode into
the gloom of the hall i followed and our footsteps
echoed with hollowness in that spacious blank
space

  i had always felt a certain timidity when with
doctor spaulding we had been friends for years
and yet strangers his was a personality which
had seemingly been fashioned for dominance over
me i had never been able in our long acquaint-
ance to raise my head squarely and hold the gaze
of his eyes my fount of conversation dried up
beneath the queer influence of him and i was re-
served and stumbling in my speech

  i admired with no malice his genius-his ec-
centric and versatile genius that had placed him at
the head of his profession had made him an emin-
ent scientist and had allowed him to conquer the
fleld of electricity he had performed during his
career many marvelous feats of surgery had made
important advances in both astronomy and chem-
istry and had given countless electrical inventions
to the world of late years he had devoted himself
entirely to electrical research

  i had seen him but once in the last year and a
half at that meeting he had hinted to me that he
was at work on a radio apparatus that would
startle the world

  it wont be called radio though brant he had
told me with a dry rasping chuckle it shall have
another name when it is finished i shall explain
it all first to you

  so when i received his phone call i concluded
that he had completed the
invention and i was
burning with curiosity as
i followed him down the
hall

  he turned into the liv-
ing room that chamber
was no darker no emptier
and no more gloomy
than any other room in
his house but i loathed it
even more than the other

for always as i entered

 was brought face to face
with a portrait of the
doctors brother and the
tragedy was forcibly re-
called to me it had been

many years ago but time had not dulled it in my
friends mind nor my own i could well remem-
ber that night and tom spauldings flight a
jump ahead of the law because he was wanted
for embezzlement of fifty thousand dollars the
disgrace of it had crushed the doctor and because
it was his beloved brother the blow was even
greater it had aged and changed him and sent him
into the life of a recluse that it was responsible for
his many invaluable discoveries was probable but
not any less regrettable at least to me as for
tom spaulding we had not heard of him since

that night but perhaps that was just as well for
we learned later that he had sunk to the lowest
level of the underworld

  i gave the picture as fleeting a glance as pos-
sible but the doctor stood for a long while gazing up
at it he seemed lost in revery at last he recov-
ered himself with a start motioned me to a chair
and turned to the huge mahogany table he bent
over a large box-like cabinet of dark wood like
and yet unlike the ordinary radio set he tinkered
for a few minutes with the knobs and dials then
he faced me again

  this is the invention he said remember the
last time i saw you i told you i was working on a
super-radio this is it a telepathy radio i have
succeeded in trapping those elusive emanations-
thought-waves i wont bore you with any explana-
tion of the inner workings of the machine it is
enough that i went to the radio and the seismo-
graph to produce it i called you so that i could
give you a demonstration as i promised you are
the first person to whom i have shown it of
course i have given it a number of tests it seems
to be a success

  his eyes had lighted with ardor and his voice
had risen to an unusual pitch but almost simul-
taneously this enthusiasm waned and his face be-
came very grave

  you know brant he said slowly i have never
given up hope of finding tom i believe he is still
living i am sure of it i want to find him that
was the incentive for this invention i can locate
him with this apparatus that is what i am going to
try to do tonight if he lives his mind will speak
through this loud speaker you understand the
radio well this machine is similar it must be
tuned into the thought-wave length of the man you
wish to reach but the machine must broadcast to

receive that is the tuning-
ing consists of the broad-
casting of a key thought
if you were seeking a mur-
derer you would broad-
cast some thought con-
cerning the crime where-
upon the receiving section
of themachine would draw
in every unspoken reflec-
tion on it and convert each
into words if your key
thought were something
known to many perhaps
published in the papers
the machine would utter a
mkflwbmffggsesstm jumble of tones and voices

                        blurred by one another
it would be a babel so many thoughts each from
a different head but then the operator would con-
tinue his broadcasting thinking into the machine
with these pseudo-receiving phones varying reflec-
tions on the crime gradually leading to some clue
some phase known only to the police and the crim-
inal the million voices would instantly dwindle
to a dozen or so whereupon it would be easy to vary
the wave-length a millionth part of a hairsbreadth
and so bring in the felons thoughts alone and clear
you may see then that i have a very dangerous con-
traption here the more so since the mind is un-

 this gripping story- worthy of a poe-is based in a
 degree upon radio a machine developed by the hero of
 the story can be tuned in to the wave-lengths of any given
 persons thoughts thus giving the possessor a wonderful
 power and this story with its tragic termination tells
 not only of the possibilities of radio in the future but
 also touches on-and elaborates-the fantastic theory that
 the electric shock sustained by the human system while in
 the electric chair does not really kill but simply puts the
 victim into a state of unconsciousness with a temporary
 cessation of organic function but this is not a mere sci-
 entific treatise on the possibilities of the future for radio
 or capital punishment it is a story full of human interest
 though not without a touch of the ghastly anyhozu you

amazing stories

aware that it is being tapped i could accomplish
great evil or great good with it but as i said be-
fore i made it only that i might find tom and now
i shall make the attempt there is a key thought
that only he can respond to an incident of our boy-
hood known i believe only to us

  he seated himself at the apparatus and adjusted
the head-phones he became intent lapsing into
a deep study i sat silent tense with curiosity and
awe there was a long stillness broken only by the
ticking of the hall clock the methodical sound of
its mechanism so frayed my nerves that i got up
and stopped it then i tiptoed back to my seat dr
spaulding had not noticed my move

  presently with an abruptness that made me start
the loud speaker began to utter sounds the doctor
removed his headpiece and we leaned forward taut-
ly the sounds were unintelligible at first then
they became clear

  its tom murmurd the doctor as he recognized
the voice and he looked happy for the first time in
years

  dawn is coming said the machine the first
hint of light oh god

  there came a confusion of sounds a jumble of
incoherent words then clearly

  here they come i see the guards and the priest
oh god they are coming they are coming

  they walk so slowly so solemnly the guards
and the priest he is in his robe i see his crucifix
it is swaying on its chain as he walks the heels
are beating so regularly so perfectly in time oh
god the guards they look grim grim as the
law law it is law there is no escape can i
beat them down  the window the door a gun
rush them when they open the door theyll kill
me kill me the chair

  the doctors face had gone white and drawn he
seemed turned to stone his fingers were tight
the machine went on in its monotonous monotone

  a rat is watching its eyes are bright it is a
gray rat how long its nose is long and sharp
it is laughing there the key is turning how
slowly it grits the bolt is drawn the door is
opening it is opening slowly so slowly how gray
everything is how strange they look the chair
there is no chance is there a chance a chance
they are in  in a group the guards have
many buttons one two three the priest how
deep his eyes are his face is very grave he is
talking the rat is watching its eyes are bright
so bright god save me i

  the sounds became incoherent and jangling the
doctor had not moved the voice became audible
again

  now walk walk walk click click click
guards so grim ill run useless theres so
much steel steel everywhere im caught im
caught in the steel the chair death what will
it be will it hurt i must be quiet i must not
tremble i must be brave walk walk walk now
the little door we are going through the cham-
ber how gray it is who are these men  there
is a crowd they are grim and sober some are
white and trembling i am trembling i must be

brave i must smile but i am going to die how
silent it is oh god

  they are strapping me into the chair i am
putty they are strapping me in it is cold-so
cold i must be brave i must smile and joke but
i am going to die how still it is they have
strapped me in he has his hand on a lever he
is waiting to kill me the current is going to be
shot god save me it is cold it is so dim his
hand is moving the lever-

  oh christ christ i am bruised i am burn-
ing i am burning up oh god    now i am
numb my flesh is sizzling and burning i can
feel it i am writhing in the chair but it doesnt
hurt now i cant move my muscles wont move
i cant close my eyes my mouth is dropped open
my jaws wont move am i paralyzed am-am i
   dead dead no everything is the same
i cant be dead the doctor is examining me he
says i pronounce this man dead 

  there was a pause the doctor had not moved a
muscle his face was the hue of the grave his
eyes were indescribable frozen

  he had not seized the significance of the last
words apparently but i had in spite of the horror
i was sunk in i realized that a theory of dr spauld-
ings had been proven

  it was fully ten years since the doctor had aroused
much interest with his attack on the use of the
electric chair it was his theory that in no case did
electricity actually kill-that it merely brought on
a paresis that simulated death striking dormant
the entire organism he had cited instances of men
struck by lightning who had recovered after many
days of total paralysis during which they retained
only sight hearing and consciousness strange it
was and hideous that tonight the doctors own
brother was proving the theory the machine spoke
again

  the fool he says i am dead the fool i wish
i could talk i would call him a fool i would laugh
at him but i cant move

  the men are leaving the guards are unstrap-
ping me they catch me as i fall they are taking
me out through the little door they are taking
me down a long hall

  i would like to shout at them they think i am
dead

  the numbness has gone i can feel their hands
holding me i can feel more intensely than before

  they are carrying me into a room what are
they going to do  my god are they going to bury
me no it is the prison hospital they are going
to bring me to life thank the good god they lay
me on a table the guards but are they the guards
they act differently never mind

  ah the surgeon is preparing to bring me to life
he is getting some instruments he has a chisel or
a saw or something in his hand he is leaning
above-

  oh christ oh bleeding jesus he i cutting
my head-

  there sounded a wild scream dr spaulding
leaped upon the machine gibbering incoherently
and smashed the mechanism into a thousand pieces

      ur author chas s wolfe seems
 at home with murders and the
 police he has a special talent
 in bringing a mystery before us and
 in picturing some of the efforts of the
 ordinary mind solving it and then in
 his own gripping way developing all
 the details so as to bring the story
 to a conclusion which is a revelation
 of a mystery here is a mysterious
 stabbing no weapon to be seen or
 found the ingress and regress of the
 murderer a profound mystery arid we
 almost fear the very name of the story
 tells too much but we know our read-
 ers will find plenty of suspense in its
 text

   i gasped i knew joe fenner as a fellow student
 wireless telegraph enthusiast and scientific dabbler
 a mighty likable but not extraordinary sort of
 fellow to find him on terms of intimacy-to say

 nothing of equality-with the

                    chief of our citys police force
                    was astounding personally ive
                    always had a little fear of police-
                    men a relic of boyhood days and
                    pranks apparently the king-
                    bee of the whole clan had no
                    terrorizing influence on joe

                      the chief dropped wearily into
                    the nearest chair youll have
                    to pardon me friend he growled
                    at me im a little short on
                    manners at the best of times and
                    this thing is getting on my
                    nerves joe turning to fen-
                    ner i want you to help us
                    again

                  i turned a mental summer-
 sault the chief of police addressing my chum as
 joe asking him to help them-again ye gods i
 was my seemingly commonplace chum p detective




amazing stories

  the chief was speaking there was a man killed
in the atwood building an hour ago ive just come
from there

  my face must have reflected the varying emotions
that this statement produced within me but joes
countenance remained passive murdered he
asked quietly how

  stabbed in the back the chief might have
been saying please pass the potatoes for all the
feeling expressed in his tones

  joe shrugged his shoulders i dont think you
want me then he said its out of my line
yes youd think so agreed the chief if it
wasnt for the peculiar circumstances surrounding
the crime

  peculiar circumstances whats peculiar about
them anyway chief queried joe

  well for one thing we cant find the knife or
whatever it was that he was stabbed with
murderer took it away with him suggested
fenner

  the chiefs face took on a pained look maybe
he did he said wearily only-theres no possible
way he could get in to btab the man in the first
place and no way that he could get out after he
had stabbed him in the second place and in the
third place the crime simply couldnt have been
committed at all but it was and there you are
chief you talk through your hat reproved
the amazing fenner with astounding disregard of
the deference due one in the chiefs position
there must be a perfectly simple way in which
some one got into the place and away again

  the chief arose my cars outside he said
come along down and have a look

  as fenner hesitated i took my cue til ride along
as far as my house if you dont mind i said

  youll ride along and have a look with me said
fenner warmly  know youre just as curious as
 am to get a look at the scene of this remarkable
crime

  the chief was almost friendly yes he invited
come along its possible that an outsider might
see something that weve all missed and you cant
do any harm

  nothing loath i accepted the invitation and
rode down to the atwood building in the tonneau
with fenner the chief was busy driving and i
managed to whisper to fenner when did you get
such a pull with the police

  he gave an amused laugh oh i answer techni-
cal questions for them occasionally my chief asset
id the fact that few know that  have any interest in
these affairs at all youll be a clam i know

  the car stopped in front of the atwood just then
and i had no chance to question him further

  the atwood was one of our skyscraper office
buildings the chief entered the corridor steered
us into an elevator and we were whisked aloft six-
teenth floor grunted the chief to the operator and
we stepped out into the corridor on that story

  following chief davidson we came to a suite
of offices the frosted glass on the door bearing
the legend corey  co general offices phew

gasped fenner who was it not-

  davidson paused with his hand on the knob yes
it was old john corey and you can guess the com-
motion thisll make

  he flung open the door and we filed in the

policeman on guard touched his cap in salute to
his superior we were in an outer office several
desks were arranged around the room and at one
of them three girls huddled in a scared little group
one was sobbing softly i noticed a man with his
back toward us looking out the window into space
apparently

  paying no attention to the occupants of this room
davidson strode across to a door marked john
corey private opening it he paused on the
threshold fenner and  crowded at his back over
his shoulder i could see into the inner office a
man clad in a grey suit was on the floor on his
hands and knees he looked up quickly

  come ahead he said to the chief you cant
spoil any marks theres nothing to spoil

  we entered

  seated at a desk in the center of the room was
a man his head rested on the flat top of the desk
his arms flung forward before him davidson
nodded toward him just as he was found he
said simply it was my first sight of violent death

  horror or some other violent emotion making
my heart throb jerkily i moved forward with fen-
ner and looked down at the corpse

  a glance at the bowed back told the tale the
coat was soaked with blood which had welled from
a gaping wound below the left shoulder blade ill
never tell you why i didnt faint i wanted to

  fenner turned to the man in grey what have
you learned frank he asked

  frank who was evidently a detective shook his
head gloomily nothing he replied except what
you see hes been stabbed thats evident and
whoever did it took the weapon away with him but
how he got in here and how he got out god alone
knows ive been over this floor on my hands and
knees with a microscope theres not a mark not
a foot print in the dust except those made by corey
himself nothing not a finger print on the walls
on the desk on the body on the floor on the door
knob-inside or out-not anywhere its beyond
me

  couldnt come in through the outer office eh
fenners eyes were roving over the room frank
shook his head slowly in negation three girls
and the head bookkeeper out there all evening
working overtime all swear not one of them has
been in this room this evening corey came in
through the outer office-the only way he could
come in for this office has only the one entrance-
and closed the door about half past eight one of
the girls opened the door to come in she saw that
something had happened to corey and she didnt
cross the threshold all of them had sense enough
to stay out they telephoned for us i was the
first man in

  no other doors

  nope only one way in through that office

  fenner was gazing at the wall on the street side
did you open that window he asked

  no it was open but it might as well have
been bricked up for all the good its going to do us
corey opened it himself no doubt its just sixteen
stories to the street and you can bet no one climbed
up to it its five stories to the roof one chance
in one thousand that any one climbed down it
would take nerves of steel to drop over the edge on
the educated harpoon



a rope and if some one did have the nerve he
couldnt have gotten in by that window noiselessly
enough not to warn corey and just assuming
that he did hed surely leave a mark doing it
wouldnt he

  fenner nodded he certainly would he ac-
quiesced how about the people in the office out
there are they all above suspicion

  all above it complained frank and not only
that but the very number of them lets them out
without question its not reasonable to suppose
that three girls and a man all trusted employees
would conspire to kill their employer without a
motive for doing so one of them might try it or
maybe even two but its hardly likely that all four
would be against the man

  right you are admitted fenner i thought
that way myself but we have to eliminate the pos-
sibility of an inside job first well chief i dont
see that i can do you any good in this matter it
is unusual enough to be interesting and if you dont
mind ill drop in and have a look around in the
morning

  help yourself gloomed davidson i dont be-
lieve you can do anything in this case myself i
just took a chance you might have you know

  i wish that i could have and ill look it over
in the morning on the off chance good night
frank and good luck good night chief come
on bill and we left

  as we walked homeward fenner said it seems
that the days of miracles are not gone by after all
what do you think of that for a puzzle

  its beyond me i replied soberly the only
possible explanation that i can think of is that the
man committed suicide

  joe stood still and rocked with laughter oh
bill bill he gasped theres only one man in a
million-yes ill make it a billion-that commits
suicide by stabbing himself in the back to say noth-
ing of calmly disposing of the weapon just after
hes dead

  well then i demanded sullenly how do you
account for the thing

  he grew thoughtful at once i cant he ad-
mitted unless-

  unless what i asked as he paused

  unless-unless-well i wouldnt want to say
unless anything just now would you like to go
down with me again tomorrow morning

  i certainly would i rejoined instantly this
things got my goat

  all right then ill stop for you on my way
down

  i lay awake for hours trying to figure out how
the thing could have been done there didnt seem
to be a plausible explanation if the facts in the
case had been handed to me us a sort of a puzzle
i would have said that it simply couldnt be done
and yet-there was the dead man

  eventually i gave it up and fell into a restless
slumber

 
next morning fenner called for me as arranged
well he asked cheerfully have you solved the
mystery over night

  no i said it seems more baffling than ever
after a nights thought have you found the
answer

  not yet do you happen to have a good pair
of field glasses

i had and i produced them thats fine said
fenner after carefully examining them lets go
we had no trouble getting into coreys offices
the body had been removed and practically all
traces of the tragedy had disappeared

  fenner dropped into the chair which so lately
had been used by the hapless victim as he sat at
the desk his back was to the window which had
been closed

  well he mused how was this man killed
if this chair could only talk suppose i was across
the street in another building ah say im an
old whaler i have a harpoon and a coil of rope
the window is open in this office that broad back

is a fine target- bill look out that window

and see if i couldnt do it

  i turned to fenner and in my most sarcastic
tones i said you could joe if you had an edu-
cated harpoon after you threw it it would pause
cannily in mid-air turn at an angle of forty-five
degrees leap agilely up about six stories make
another forty-five degree turn slide gracefully

through the window and-

  but fenner was on his feet and beside me his
face was grave but his eyes twinkled sufficient
william he said your sarcasm is excellent but
im too busy to listen to the rest of it lets have
those field glasses

  ten minutes passed i began to grow fidgety when
he suddenly handed the glasses to me bill he
said do you see that building out there-the one
that appears to be as high as this one 

  i do i replied that could only be the yeakle
it and the atwood are the two tallest buildings we
have

  well look it over carefully and tell me if you
make out a clothes line on the roof

  i gazed at first i didnt see one but presently
i located it i told fenner that there was undoubt-
edly a clothes line there

  so i thought he said absently well-lets
call davidson over here its up to him now

  i stared amazed up to him i parroted
whats up to him

the arrest of the murderer said fenner rather
impatiently youre on to the thing arent you
do you mean that you know who killed corey
i asked excitedly as fenner reached for the tele-
phone

  he paused with his hand on the receiver no
i dont but i know what he was killed with-and
davidson will find out the rest

  well i demanded what was he killed with
fenner called a number into the phone and gave
me a sweet smile over his shoulder as he waited
that chunk of clothes line and- he grew ex-
ceedingly sarcastic an educated harpoon

  nor would he say more until davidson with
frank at his heels burst into the room seething
with excitement

  whats this joe panted the chief find
something got anything

joe leaned back in his chair and i saw that he was
enjoying himself immensely yes chief he said
cheerfully i know what forey was killed with
the chief darted a fiery glance at frank and

  he diamond lens

 bif fitzjames obrien 

author of the wondersmith

while simon was relating this to me i regarded the great diamond attentively never had i beheld anything so beautiful all
the glories of light ever imagined or described seamed to pulsato in its crystalline chambers its weight aa  learned from siraon

was exactly one hundred and forty carats

chapter i

the bending of the twig

a very early period of my life the
e bent of my inclinations had been
rds microscopic investigations
n i was not more than ten years
a distant relative of our family
hoping to astonish my inexperience constructed
a simple microscope for me by drilling in a disk
of copper a small hole in which a drop of pure
water was sustained by capillary attraction this
very primitive apparatus magnifying some fifty
diameters presented it is true only indistinct and
imperfect forms but still sufficiently wonderful to
work up my imagination to a preternatural state of
excitement

  seeing me so interested in this rude instrument
my cousin explained to me all that he knew about
the principles of the microscope related to me a
few of the wonders which had been accomplished
through its agency and ended by promising to send
me one regularly constructed immediately on his
return to the city i counted the days the hours
the minutes that intervened between that promise
and his departure

  meantime i was not idle every transparent sub-
stance that bore the remotest resemblance to a lens
i eagerly seized upon and employed in vain at-
tempts to realize that instrument the theory of
whose construction i as yet only vaguely compre-
hended all panes of glass containing those oblate
spheroidal knots familiarly known as bulls eyes
were ruthlessly destroyed in the hope of obtaining
lenses of marvellous power i even went so far
as to extract the crystalline humor from the eyes
of fishes and animals and endeavored to press it into
the microscopic service i plead guilty to having
stolen the glasses from my aunt agathas spectacles
with a dim idea of grinding them into lenses of won-
drous magnifying pro-
perties-in which at-
tempt it is scarcely neces-
sary to say that i totally
failed

a real microscope at last

t last the promised
instrument came it
was of that order known
as fields simple micro-
scope and had cost
perhaps about fifteen dol-
lars as far as educa-
tional purposes went a
better apparatus could
not have been selected accompanying it was a
small treatise on the microscope-its history
uses and discoveries i comprehended then
for the first time the arabian nights enter-
tainments the dull veil of ordinary existence that
hungacross the world seemed suddenly to roll away
and to lay bare a land of enchantments i felt to-
wards my companions as the seer might feel to
wards the ordinary masses of men i held con-
versations with nature in a tongue which they could
not understand i was in daily communication with
living wonders such as they never imagined in their

wildest visions i penetrated beyond the external
portal of things and roamed through the sanc-
tuaries where they beheld only a drop of rain
slowly rolling down the window-glass i saw a uni-
verse of beings animated with all the passions com-
mon to physical life and convulsing their minute
sphere with struggles as fierce and protracted as
those of men in the common spots of mould
which my mother good housekeeper that she was
fiercely scooped away from her jam pots there
abode for me under the name of mildew enchanted
gardens filled with dells and avenues of the densest
foliage and most astonishing verdure while from
the fantastic boughs of these microscopic forests
hung strange fruits glittering with green and sil-
ver and gold

  it was no scientific thirst that at this time filled
my mind it was the pure enjoyment of a poet
to whom a world of wonders had been disclosed
i talked of my solitary pleasures to none alone
with my microscope i dimmed my sight day after
day and night after night poring over the marvels
which it unfolded to me i was like one who hav-
ing discovered the ancient eden still existing in all
its primitive glory should resolve to enjoy it in soli-
tude and never betray to mortal the secret of its
locality the rod of my life was bent at this mo-
ment i destined myself to be a microscopist

he imagines himself a discoverer

of course like every novice i fancied myself a
discoverer i was ignorant at the time of the
thousands of acute intellects engaged in the same
pursuit as myself and with the advantage of instru-
ments a thousand times more powerful than mine
the names of leeuwenhoek williamson spencer
ehrenberg schultz dujardin schact and schleiden
were then entirely unknown to me or if known
i was ignorant of their patient and wonderful re-
searches in every fresh specimen of cryptogamia
which i placed beneath
my instrument i believed
that i discovered wonders
of which the world was
as yet ignorant i re-
member well the thrill of
delight and admiration
that shot through me the
first time that i dis-
covered the common
wheel animalcule roti-
fera vulgaris expanding
and contracting its flex-
ible spokes and seemingly
rotating through the
water alas as i grew
older and obtained some works treating of my
favorite study i found that i was only on the
threshhold of a science to the investigation of which
some of the greatest men of the age were devoting
their lives and intellects

  as i grew up my parents who saw but little
likelihood of anything practical resulting from the
examination of bits of moss and drops of water
through a brass tube and a piece of glass were
anxious that i should choose a profession it was
their desire that i should enter the counting-house
of my uncle ethan blake a prosperous merchant

 rpiiis classic by the famous author is not as widely
 known as it deserves to be the story is a master-
 piece from every angle although it was written over
 fifty years ago there is no question that mr obrien
 must have been an expert on microscopy because only a
 master could go into the details as he does in this story

    the theme while fantastic is beautiful in its extreme
 and the advent of the ultra-microscope invented long
 after obrien had died lends nciv color to this story
 which can be read and re-read many times-a story that
 will stand out from many others for generations to
 come


amazing stories

who carried on business in new york this sug-
gestion i decisively combated i had no taste for
trade i should only make a failure in short i re-
fused to become a merchant

  but it was necessary for me to select some pur-
suit my parents were staid new england people
who insisted on the necessity of labor and there-
fore although thanks to the bequest of my poor
aunt agatha i should on coming of age inherit
a small fortune sufficient to place me above want
it was decided that instead of waiting for this
i should act the nobler part and employ the in-
tervening years in rendering myself independent

selecting a profession

after much cogitation i complied with the
wishes of my family and selected a profession
i determined to study medicine at the new york
academy this disposition of my future suited
me a removal from my relatives would enable
me to dispose of my time as i pleased without fear
of detection as long as i paid my academy fees
i might shirk attending the lectures if i chose and
as i never had the remotest intention of standing
an examination there was no danger of my being
plucked besides a metropolis was the place for
me there i could obtain excellent instruments the
newest publications intimacy with men of pursuits
kindred with my own-in short all things neces-
sary to insure a profitable devotion of my life to
my beloved science i had an abundance of money
few desires that were not bounded by my illumi-
nating mirror on one side and my object-glass on
the other what therefore was to prevent my be-
coming an illustrious investigator of the veiled
worlds it was with the most buoyant hope that i
left my new england home and established my-
self in new york

chapter ii
the longing of a man of science

my first step of course was to find suitable
apartments these i obtained after a
couple of days search in fourth avenue
a very pretty second-floor unfurnished containing
sitting-room bed-room and a smaller apartment
which i intended to fit up as a laboratory i fur-
nished my lodgings simply but rather elegantly
and then devoted all my energies to the adornment
of the temple of my worship i visited pike the
celebrated optician and passed in review his
splendid collection of microscopes-fields com-
pound hinghams spencers nachets binocular
that founded on the principles of the stereoscope
and at length fixed upon that form known as spen-
cers trunnion microscope as combining the great-
est number of improvements with an almost perfect
freedom from tremor along with this i pur-
chased every possible accessory-draw-tubes
micrometers a camerarlucida lever-stage achro-
matic condensers white cloud illuminators prisms
parabolic condensers polarizing apparatus forceps
aquatic boxes fishing-tubes with a host of other
articles all of which would have been useful in the
hands of an experienced microscopist but as i
afterwards discovered were not of the slightest
present value to me it takes years of practice to
know how to use a complicated microscope the

optician looked suspiciously at me as i made these
wholesale purchases he evidently was uncertain
whether to set me down as some scientific celebrity
or a madman i think he inclined to the latter
belief i suppose i was mad every great genius
is mad upon the subject in which he is greatest
the unsuccessful madman is disgraced and called a
lunatic

at last some real discoveries aro madie

mad or not i set myself to work with a zeal
which few scientific students have ever
equalled i had everything to learn relative to the
delicate study upon which i had embarked-a study
involving the most earnest patience the most rigid
analytic powers the steadiest hand the most un-
tiring eye the most refined and subtile manipula-
tion	i

  for a long time half my apparatus lay inactively
on the shelves of my laboratory which was now
most amply furnished with every possible con-
trivance for facilitating my investigations the
fact was that i did not know how to use some of
my scientific implements-never having been
taught microscopics-and those whose use i un-
derstood theoretically were of little avail until by
practice i could attain the necessary delicacy of
handling still such was the fury of my ambition
such the untiring perseverance of my experiments
that difficult of credit as it may be in the course
of one year i became theoretically and practically
an accomplished microscopist

  during this period of my labors in which i sub-
mitted specimens of every substance that came
under my observation to the action of my lenses i
became a discoverer-in a small way it is true
for i was very young but still a discoverer it
was i who destroyed ehrenbergs theory that the
volvox globator was an animal and proved that his
monads with stomachs and eyes were merely
phases of the formation of a vegetable cell and
were when they reached their mature state incap-
able of the act of conjugation or any true genera-
tive act without which no organism rising to any
stage of life higher than vegetable can be said to be
complete it was i who resolved the singular prob-
lem of rotation in the cells and hairs of plants into
ciliary attraction in spite of the assertions of
mr wenham and others that my explanation was
the result of an optical illusion

  but notwithstanding these discoveries labori-
ously and painfully made as they were i ftelt
horribly dissatisfied at every step i found myself
stopped by the imperfections of my instruments
like all active microscopists i gave my imagination
full play indeed it is a common complaint against
many such that they supply the defects of their
instruments with the creations of their brains i
imagined depths beyond depths in nature which
the limited power of my lenses prohibited me from
exploring i lay awake at night constructing
imaginary microscopes of immeasurable power
with which i seemed to pierce through all the
envelopes of matter down to its original atom how
i cursed those imperfect media which necessity
through ignorance compelled me to use how i
longed to discover the secret of some perfect lens
whose magnifying power should be limited only
the diamond lens



by the resolvability of the object and which at the
same time should be free from spherical and
chromatic aberrations in short from all the obstacles
over which the poor microscopist finds himself con-
tinually stumbling i felt convinced that the sim-
ple microscope composed of a single lens of such
vast yet perfect power was possible of construction
to attempt to bring the compound microscope up
to such a pitch would have been commencing at
the wrong end this latter being simply a partially
successful endeavor to remedy those very defects
of the simple instrument which if conquered would
leave nothing to be desired

working on the manufacture of microscopes

it was in this mood of mind that i became a con-
structive microscopist after another year pass-
ed in this new pursuit experimenting on every
imaginable substance-glass gems flints crystals
artificial crystals formed of the alloy of various
vitreous materials-in short having constructed as
many varieties of lenses as argus had eyes i
found znyself precisely where i started with noth-
ing gained save an extensive knowledge of glass-
making i was almost dead with despair my
parents were surprised at my apparent want of
progress in my medical studies i had not attended
one lecture since my arrival in the city and the
expenses of my mad pursuit had been so great as
to embarrass me very seriously

   i was in this frame of mind one day experiment-
ing in my laboratory on a small diamond-that
stone from its great refracting power having al-
ways occupied my attention more than any other-
when a young frenchman who lived on the floor
above me and who was in the habit of occasionally
visiting me entered the room

in search of a diamond microscope lens

i think that jules simon was a jew he had
many traits of the hebrew character a love of
iewelry of dress and of good living there was
iomething mysterious about him he always had
something to sell and yet went into excellent society
when i say sell i should perhaps have said peddle
for his operations were generally confined to the
disposal of single articles-a picture for instance
or a rare carving in ivory or a pair of duelling-
pistols or the dress of a mexican caballero when i
was first furnishing my rooms he paid me a visit
which ended in my purchasing an antique silver
lamp which he assured me was a cellini-it was
handsome enough even for that-and some other
knickknacks for my sitting-room why simon
should pursue this petty trade i never could imagine
he apparently had plenty of money and had the
entree of the best houses in the city-taking care
however i suppose to drive no bargains within the
enchanted circle of the upper ten i came at length
to the conclusion that this peddling was but a mask
to cover some greater object and even went so far
as to believe my young acquaintance to be implicated
in the slave-trade that however was none of
my affair

   on the present occasion simon entered my room
in a state of considerable excitement

  ahl mon ami he cried before i could even
offer him the ordinary salutation it has occurred

to me to be the witness of the most astonishing
things in the world i promenade myself to the

house of madame- how does the little animal

-le renard-name himself in the latin

a spiritualistic medium

cctulpes i answered

  v ah yes-vulpes i promenade myself to
the house of madame vulpes

  the spirit medium

  yes the great medium great heavens what a
woman i write on a slip of paper many ques-
tions concerning affairs the most secret-affairs
that conceal themselves in the abysses of my heart
the most profound and behold by example what
occurs this devil of a woman makes me replies
the most truthful to all of them she talks to me
of things that i do not love to talk of to myself
what am i to think i am fixed to the earth
am i to understand you m simon that this
mrs vulpes replied to questions secretly written by
you which questions related to events known only
to yourself

  ah more than that more than that he an-
swered with an air of some alarm she related to
me things- but he added after a pause and
suddenly changing his manner why occupy our-
selves with these follies it was all the biology
without doubt it goes without saying that it has
not my credence-but why are we here mon ami
it has occurred to me to discover the most beautiful
thing as you can imagine-a vase with green
lizards on it composed by the great bernard palissy
it is in my apartment let us mount i go to show
it to you

  i followed simon mechanically but my thoughts
were far from palissy and his enamelled ware al-
though i like him was seeking in the dark a great
discovery this casual mention of the spiritualist
madame vulpes set me on a new track what if
this spiritualism should be really a great fact
what if through communication with more subtile
organisms than my own i could reach at a single
bound the goal which perhaps a life of agonizing
mental toil would never enable me to attain

  while purchasing the palissy vase from my
friend simon i was mentally arranging a visit to
madame vulpes

chapter iii

the spirit of leeuwenhoek

two eveningb after this thanks to an arrange-
ment by letter and the promise of an ample
fee i found madame vulpes awaiting me at
her residence alone she was a coarse-featured
woman with keen and rather cruel dark eyes and
n exceedingly sensual expression about her mouth
and under jaw she received me in perfect silence
in an apartment on the ground floor very sparely
furnished in the centre of the room close to
where mrs vulpes sat there was a common round
mahogany table if i had come for the purpose
of sweeping her chimney the woman could not have
looked more indifferent to my appearance there
was no attempt to inspire the visitor with awe
everything bore a simple and practical aspect


amazing stories

this intercourse with the spiritual world was
evidently as familiar an occupation with mrs vulpe
as eating her dinner or riding in an omnibus

  you come for a communication mr linley
said the medium in a dry business-like tone of
voice

  by appointment-yes

  what sort of communication do you want-a

written one

  yes-i wish for a written one

  from any particular spirt

  yes

have you ever known this spirit on this earth
never he died long before i was born i
wish merely to obtain from him some information
which he ought to be able to give better than any
other

  will you seat yourself at the table mr linley
said the medium and place your hands upon it
i obeyed-mrs vulpes being seated opposite to
me with her hands also on the table we remained
thus for about a minute and a half when a violent
succession of raps came on the table on the back
of my chair on the floor immediately under my feet
and even on the windowpanes mrs vulpes smiled
composedly

  they are very strong to-night she remarked
you are fortunate she then continued will the
spirits communicate with this gentleman
vigorous affirmative

  will the particular spirit he desires to speak
with communicate

  a very confused rapping followed this question

  i know what they mean said mrs vulpes
addressing herself to me they wish you to write
down the name of the particular spirit that you de-
sire to converse with is that so she added
speaking to her invisible guests

  that it was so was evident from the numerous
affirmatory responses while this was going on i
tore a slip from my pocket-book and scribbled a
name under the table

  will this spirit communicate in writing with this
gentleman asked the medium once more

  after a moments pause her hand seemed to be
seized with a violent tremor shaking so forcibly
that the table vibrated she said that a spirit had
seized her hand and would write i handed her
some sheets of paper that were on the table and a
pencil the latter she held loosely in her hand
which presently began to move over the paper with
a singular and seemingly involuntary motion after
a few moments had elapsed she handed me the
paper on which i found written in a large unculti-
vated hand the words he is not here but has been
sent for a pause of a minute or so now ensued
during which mrs vulpes remained perfectly silent
but the raps continued at regular intervals when
the short period i mention had elapsed the hand of
the medium was again seized with its convulsive
tremor and she wrote under this strange influence
a few words on the paper which she handed to me
they were as follows-

  i am here question me

leeuwenhoek

  i was astounded the name was identical with
that i had written beneath the table and carefully
kept concealed neither was it at all probable that

bn uncultivated woman like mrs vulpes should
know even the name of the great father of micro-
scopics it may have been biology but this theory
was soon doomed to be destroyed i wrote on my
slip-still concealing it from mrs vulpes-a series
of questions which to avoid tediousness i shall
place with the responses in the order in which they
occurred-

  i-can the microscope be brought to perfection

  spirit-yes

  i-am i destined to accomplish this great task

  spieit-you are

  i-i wish to know how to proceed to attain this
end for the love which you bear to science help
me

  spirit-a diamond of one hundred and forty
carats submitted to electro-magnetic currents for a
long period will experience a rearrangement of its
atoms inter se and from that stone you will form
the universal lens

  i-will great discoveries result from the use
of such a lens

  spirit-so great that all that has gone before
is as nothing

  i-but the refractive power of the diamond is
so immense that the image will be formed within
the lens how is that difficulty to be surmounted

  spirit-pierce the lens through its axis and the
difficulty is obviated the image will be formed in
the pierced space which will itself serve as a tube
to look through now i am called good night

the diamond found

i cannot at all describe the effect that these ex-
traordinary communications had upon me i
felt completely bewildered no biological theory
could account for the discovery of the lens the
medium might by means of biological rapport with
my mind have gone so far as to read my questions
and reply to them coherently but biology could
not enable her to discover that magnetic currents
would so alter the crystals of the diamond as to rem-
edy its previous defects and admit of its being
polished into a perfect lens some such theory may
have passed through my head it is true but if so
i had forgotten it in my excited condition of mind
there was no course left but to become a convert
and it was in a state of the most painful nervous
exaltation that i left the mediums house that even-
ing she accompanied me to the door hoping that
i was satisfied the raps followed us as we went
through the hall sounding on the balusters the
flooring and even the lintels of the door i hastily
expressed my satisfaction and escaped hurriedly
into the cool night air i walked home with but
one thought possessing me-how to obtain a dia-
mond of the immense size required my entire
means multiplied a hundred times over would have
been inadequate to its purchase besides such
stones are rare and become historical i could
find such only in the regalia of eastern or european
monarchs

chapter iv

the eye of morning

there was a light in simons room as i
entered my house a vague impulse urged
me to visit him as i opened the door of his
the diamond lens



sitting-room unannounced he was bending with his
back toward me over a carcel lamp apparently
engaged in minutely examining some object which
he held in his hands as i entered he started sud-
denly thrust his hand into his breast pocket and
turned to me with a face crimson with confusion

  what i cried poring over the miniature of
some fair lady well dont blush so much i
wont ask to see it

  simon laughed awkardly enough but made none
of the negative protestations usual on such occa-
sions he asked me to take a seat

  simon said i i have just come from madame
vulpes

  this time simon turned as white as a sheet and
seemed stupefied as if a sudden electric shock had
smitten him he babbled some incoherent words
and went hastily to a small closet where he usually
kept his liquors although astonished at his emo-
tion i was too preoccupied with my own idea to pay
much attention to anything else

  you say truly when you call madame vulpes a
devil of a woman i continued simon she told
me wonderful things to-night or rather was the
means of telling me wonderful things ah if i
could only get a diamond that weighed one hundred
and forty carats

  scarcely had the sigh with which i uttered this
desire died upon my lips when simon with the
aspect of a wild beast glared at me savagely and
rushing to the mantelpiece where some foreign
weapons hung on the wall caught up a malay
creese and brandished it furiously before him

  no he cried in french into which he always
broke when excited no you shall not have it
you are perfidious you have consulted with that
demon and desire my treasure but i shall die
first me i am brave you cannot make me
fear

the dealer is suspicious

all this uttered in a loud voice trembling with
excitement astounded me i saw at a glance
that i had accidentally trodden upon the edges of
simons secret whatever it was it was necessary
to reassure him

  my dear simon i said i am entirely at a loss
to know what you mean i went to madame vulpes
to consult her on a scientific problem to the solution
of which i discovered that a diamond of the size i
just mentioned was necessary you were never al-
luded to during the evening nor so far as i was
concerned even thought of what can be the mean-
ing of this outburst if you happen to have a set
of valuable diamonds in your possession you need
fear nothing from me the diamond which i re-
quire you could not possess or if you did possess
dt you would not be living here

  something in my tone must have completely reas-
isured him for his expression immediately changed
to a sort of constrained merriment combined how-
ever with a certain suspicious attention to my
movements he laughed and said that i must bear
with him that he was at certain moments subject
to a speoies of vertigo which betrayed itself in
incoherent speeches and that the attacks passed off
as rapidly as they came he put his weapon aside

while making this explanation and endeavored with
some success to assume a more cheerful air

  all this did not impose on me in the least i was
too much accustomed to analytical labors to be
baffled by so flimsy a veil i determined to probe the
mystery to the bottom

  simon i said gayly let us forget all this over
a bottle of burgundy i have a case of lausseures
clos vougeot down-stairs fragrant with the odors
and ruddy with the sunlight of the cote dor let
us have up a couple of bottles what say you
with all my heart answered simon smilingly
i produced the wine and we seated ourselves to
drink it was of a famous vintage that of  a
year when war and wine throve together-and its
pure but powerful juice seemed to impart renewed
vitality to the system by the time we had half
finished the second bottle simons head which i
knew was a weak one had begun to yield while i
remained calm as ever only that every draught
seemed to send a flush of vigor through my limbs
simons utterance became more and more indistinct
he took to singing french chansons of a not very
moral tendency i rose suddenly from the table just
at the conclusion of one of those incoherent
verses and fixing my eyes on him with a quiet
smile said simon i have deceived you i learned
your secret this evening you may as well be frank
with me mrs vulpes or rather one of her spirits
told me all

a wonderful rose diamond

he started with horror his intoxication seemed
for the moment to fade away and he made a
movement towards the weapon that he had a short
time before laid down i stopped him with my
hand

  monster he cried passionately i am ruined
what shall i do you shall never have it i swear
by my mother

  i dont want it i said rest secure but be
frank with me tell me all about it

  the drunkenness began to return he protested
with maudlin earnestness that i was entirely mis-
taken-that i was intoxicated then asked me to
swear eternal secrecy and promised to disclose the
mystery to me i pledged myself of course to all
with an uneasy look in his eyes and hands unsteady
with drink and nervousness he drew a small case
from his breast and opened it heavens how the
mild lamp-light was shivered into a thousand pris-
matic arrows as it fell upon a vast rose-diamond
that glittered in the case i was no judge of dia-
monds but i saw at a glance that this was a gem of
rare size and purity i looked at simon with won-
der and-must i confess it-with envy how
could he have obtained this treasure in reply to
my questions i could just gather from his drunken
statements of which i fancy half the incoherence
was affected that he had been superintending a
gang of slaves engaged in diamond-washing in
brazil that he had seen one of them secrete a
diamond but instead of informing his employers
had quietly watched the negro until he saw him
bury his treasure that he had dug it up and fled
with it but that as yet he was afraid to attempt to
dispose of it publicly-so valuable a gem being
almost certain to attract too much attention to its


amazing stories

owners antecedentsand he had not been able to
discover any of those obscure channels by which
such matters are conveyed away safely he added
that in accordance with the oriental practice he
had named his diamond with the fanciful title of
the eye of morning

  while simon was relating this to me i regarded
the great diamond attentively never had i beheld
anything so beautiful all the glories of light ever
imagined or described seemed to pulsate in its
crystalline chambers its weight as i learned from
simon was exactly one hundred and forty carats
here was an amazing coincidence the hand of
destiny seemed in it on the very evening when the
spirit of leeuwenhoek communicatee to me the great
secret of the microscope the priceless means which
he directs me to employ start up within my easy
reach i determined with the most perfect delib-
eration to possess myself of simons diamond

he murders the dealer

i sat opposite to him while he nodded over his
glass and calmly revolved the whole affair i
did not for an instant contemplate so foolish an act
as a common theft which would of course be dis-
covered or at least necessitate flight and conceal-
ment all of which must interfere with my scientific
plans there was but one step to be taken-to kill
simon after all what was the life of a little ped-
dling jew in comparison with the interests of
science human beings are taken every day from
the condemned prisons to be experimented on by
surgeons this man simon was by his own con-
fession a criminal a robber and i believed on my
soul a murderer he deserved death quite as much
as any felon condemned by the laws why should
not i like the government contrive that his punish-
ment should contribute to the progress of human
knowledge

  the means for accomplishing everything i de-
sired lay within my reach there stood upon the
mantelpiece a bottle half full of french laudanum
simon was so occupied with his diamond which i
had just restored to him that it was an affair of
no difficulty to drug his glass in a quarter of an
hoar he was in a profound sleep

  i now opened his waistcoat took the diamond
from the inner pocket in which he had placed it
and removed him to the bed on which i laid him
so that his feet hung down over the edge i had
possessed myself of the malay creese which i held
in my right hand while with the other i discovered
as accurately as i could by pulsation the exact
locality of the heart it was essential that all the
aspects of his death should lead to the surmise of
self-murder i calculated the exact angle at which
it was probable that the weapon if levelled by
simons own hand would enter his breast then with
one powerful blow i thrust it up to the hilt in the
very spot which i desired to penetrate a con-
vulsive thrill ran through simons limbs i heard
a smothered sound issue from his throat precisely
like the bursting of a large air-bubble sent up by
a diver when it reaches the surface of the water
he turned half round on his side and as if to assist
my plans more effectually his right hand moved
by some mere spasmodic impulse clasped the han-
dle of the creese which it remained holding with

extraordinary muscular tenacity beyond this
there was no apparent struggle the laudanum i
presume paralyzed the usual nervous action he
must have died instantly

  there was yet something to be done to make
it certain that all suspicion of the act should be
diverted from any inhabitant of the house to simon
himself it was necessary that the door should be
found in the morning locked on the inside how to
do this and afterwards escape myself not by the
window that was a physical impossibility besides
i was determined that the windows also should be
found bolted the solution was simple enough i
descended softly to my own room for a peculiar in-
strument which i had used for holding small slip-
pery substances such as minute spheres of glass
etc this instrument was nothing more than a
long slender hand-vice with a very powerful grip
and a considerable leverage which last was acci-
dentally owing to the shape of the handle nothing
was simpler than when the key was in the lock to
seize the end of its stem in this vice through the
keyhole from the outside and so lock the door
previously however to doing this i burned a num-
ber of papers on simons hearth suicides almost
always burn papers before they destroy themselves
i also emptied some more laudanum into simons
glasb-having first removed from it all traces of
wine-cleaned the other wine-glass and brought
the bottles away with me if traces of two persons
drinking had been found in the room the question
naturally would have arisen who was the second
besides the wine-bottles might have been identified
as belonging to me the laudanum i poured out to
account for its presence in his stomach in case of a
post-mortem examination the theory naturally
would be that he first intended to poison himself
but after swallowing a little of the drug was either
disgusted with its taste or changed his mind from
other motives and chose the dagger these
arrangements made i walked out leaving the gas
burning locked the door with my vice and went to
bed

a verdict of suicide

simons death was not discovered until nearly
three in the afternoon the servant astonished
at seeing the gas burning-the light streaming on
the dark landing from under the door-peeped
through the keyhole and saw simon on the bed
she gave the alarm the door was burst open and
the neighborhood was in a fever of excitement

  every one in the house was arrested myself in-
cluded there was an inquest but no clew to his
death beyond that of suicide could be obtained
curiously enough he had made several speeches to
his friends the preceding week that seemed to point
to self-destruction one gentleman swore that
simon had said in his presence that he was tired of
life his landlord affirmed that simon when pay-
ing him his last months rent remarked that he
should not pay him rent much longer all the
other evidence corresponded-the door locked in-
side the position of the corpse the burnt papers
as i anticipated no one knew of the possession of
the diamond by simon so that no motive was sug-
gested for his murder the jury after a prolonged
examination brought in the usual verdict and the
the diamond lens



neighborhood once more settled down into its ac-
customed quiet

chapter v
animula

the three months succeeding simons catas-
trophe i devoted night and day to my diamond
lens i had constructed a vast galvanic bat-
tery composed of nearly two thousand pairs of
plates-a higher power i dared not use lest the
diamond should be calcined by means of this
enormous engine i was enabled to send a powerful
current of electricity continually through my great
diamond which it seemed to me gained in lustre
every day at the expiration of a month i com-
menced the grinding and polishing of the lens a
work of intense toil and exquisite delicacy the
great density of the stone and the care required to
be taken with the curvatures of the surfaces of the
lens rendered the labor the severest and most har-
assing that i had yet undergone

  at last the eventful moment came the lens was
completed i stood trembling on the threshold of
new worlds i had the realization of alexanders
famous wish before me the lens lay on the table
ready to be placed upon its platform my hand
fairly shook a i enveloped a drop of water with a
thin coating of oil of turpentine preparatory to its
examination-a process necessary in order to pre-
vent the rapid evaporation of the water i now
placed the drop on a thin slip of glass under the
lens and throwing upon it by the combined aid of a
prism and a mirror a powerful stream of light i
approached my eye to the minute hole drilled
through the axis of the lens for an instant i saw
nothing save what seemed to be an illuminated
chaos a vast luminous abyss a pure white light
cloudless and serene and seemingly limitless as
space itself was my first impression gently and
with the greatest care i depressed the lens a few
hairs-breadths the wondrous illumination still
continued but as the lens approached the object a
scene of indescribable beauty was unfolded to my
view

   i seemed to gaze upon a vast space the limits of
which extended far beyond my vision an atmos-
phere of magical luminousness permeated the en-
tire field of view i was amazed to see no trace of
animalculous life not a living thing apparently
inhabited that dazzling expanse i comprehended in-
stantly that by the wondrous power of my lens i
had penetrated beyond the grosser particles of
aqueous matter beyond the realms of infusoria and
protozoa down to the original gaseous globule into
whose luminous interior i was gazing as into an al-
most boundless dome filled with  supernatural ra-
diance

the first visions of beauty

it was however no brilliant void into which i
looked on every side i beheld beautiful or-
ganic forms of unknown texture and colored with
the most enchanting hues these forms presented
the appearance of what might be called for want
of a more specific definition foliated clouds of the
highest rarity that is they undulated and broke in-
to vegetable formation and wprp tinpprt with splen-

dors compared with which the gilding of our autumn
woodlands is as dross compared with gold far
away into the illimitable distance stretched long
avenues of these gaseous forests dimly transparent
and painted with prismatic hues of unimaginable
brilliancy the pendent branches waved along the
fluid glades until every vista seemed to break
through half-lucent ranks of many-colored drooping
silken pennons what seemed to be either fruits or
flowers pied with a thousand hues lustrous and
ever varying bubbled from the crowns of this fairy
foliage no hills no lakes no rivers no forms ani-
mate or inanimate were to be seen save those vast
auroral copses that floated serenely in the luminous
stillness with leaves and fruits and flowers gleam-
ing with unknown fires unrealizable by mere ima-
gination

  how strange i thought that this sphere should
be thus condemned to solitude i had hoped at
least to discover some new form of animal life-
perhaps of a lower class than any with which we
are at present acquainted but still some living or-
ganism i found my newly discovered world if i
may so speak a beautiful chromatic desert

   while i was speculating on the singular arrange-
ments of the internal economy of nature with
which she so frequently splinters into atoms our
most compact theories i thought i beheld a form
moving slowly through the glades of one of the pris-
matic forests i looked more attentively and found
that i was not mistaken words cannot depict the
anxiety with which i awaited the nearer approach
of this mysterious object was it merely some in-
animate substance held in suspense in the atten-
uated atmosphere of the globule or was it an ani-
mal endowed with vitality and motion it ap-
proached flitting behind the gauzy colored veils of
cloud-foliage for seconds dimly revealed then van-
ishing at last the violet pennon that trailed
nearest to me vibrated they were gently pushed
aside and the form floated out into the broad light

the glorious animula

tt was a female human shape when i say hu-
man i mean it possessed the outlines of hu-
manity-but there the analogy ends its adorable
beauty lifted it illimitable heights beyond the love-
liest daughter of adam

  i cannot i dare not attempt to inventory the
charms of this divine revelation of perfect beauty
those eyes of mystic violet dewy and serene evade
my words her long lustrous hair following her
glorious head in a golden wake like the track sown
in heaven by a falling star seems to quench my most
burning phrases with its splendors if all the bees
of hybla nestled upon my lips they would still sing
but hoarsely the wondrous harmonies of outline that
enclosed her form

  she swept out from between the rainbow-curtains
of the cloud-trees into the broad sea of light that lay
beyond her motions were those of some graceful
naiad cleaving by a mere effort of her will the
clear unruffled waters that fill the chambers of the
sea she floated forth with the serene grace of a
frail bubble ascending through the still atmosphere
of a june day the perfect roundness of her limbs
formed suave and enchanting curves it was like

amazing stories

thoven the divine to watch the harmonious flow of
lines this indeed was a pleasure cheaply pur-
chased at any price what cared i if i had waded
to the portal of this wonder through anothers
blood i would have given my own to enjoy one
such moment of intoxication and delight

  breathless with gazing on this lovely wonder and
forgetful for an instant of everything save her pres-
ence i withdrew my eye from the microscope
eagerly-alas as my gaze fell on the thin slide
that lay beneath my instrument the bright light
from mirror and from prism sparkled on a colorless
drop of water there in that tiny bead of dew
this beautiful being was forever imprisoned the
planet neptune was not more distant from me than
she i hastened once more to apply my eye to the
microscope

  animula let me now call her by that dear name
which i subsequently bestowed on her had changed
her position she had again approached the won-
drous forest and was gazing earnestly upwards
presently one of the trees-as i must call them-
unfolded a long ciliary process with which it seized
one of the gleaming fruits that glittered on its sum-
mit and sweeping slowly down held it within reach
of animula the sylph took it in her delicate hand
and began to eat my attention was so entirely
absorbed by her that i could not apply myself to
the task of determining whether this singular plant
was or was not instinct with volition

more about his love animula

i watched her with the most profound at-
tention as she made her repast the suppleness
of her motions sent a thrill of delight through my
frame my heart beat madly as she turned her
beautiful eyes in the direction of the spot in which i
stood what would i not have given to have had
the power to precipitate myself into that luminous
ocean and float with her through those groves of
purple and gold while i was thus breathlessly
following her every movement she suddenly started
seemed to listen for a moment and then cleaving
the brilliant ether in which she was floating like a
flashoftlight pierced through the opaline forest
and disappeared

  instantly a series of the most singular sensations
attacked me it seemed as if i had suddenly gone
blind the luminous sphere was still before me but
my daylight had vanished what caused this sud-
den disappearance  had she a lover or a husband 
yes that was the solution some signal from a
happy fellow-being had vibrated through the
avenues of the forest and she had obeyed the sum-
mons

  the agony of my sensations as i arrived at this
conclusion startled me i tried to reject the con-
viction that my reason forced upon me i battled
against the fatal conclusion-but in vain it was
so i had no escape from it i loved an animalcule

  it is true that thanks to the marvellous power of
my microscope she appeared of human proportions
instead of presenting the revolting aspect of the
coarser creatures that live and struggle and die in
the more easily resolvable portions of the water-
drop she was fair and delicate and of surpassing
beauty but of what account was all that every
time that my eye was withdrawn from the instru-

ment it fell on a miserable drop of water within
which i must be content to know dwelt all that
could make my life lovely

  could she but see me once could i for one mo-
ment pierce the mystical walls that so inexorably
rose to separate us and whisper all that filled my
soul i might consent to be satisfied for the rest of
my life with the knowledge of her remote sympathy
it would be something to have established even the
faintest personal link to bind us together-to know
that at times when roaming through those en-
chanted glades she might think of the wonderful
stranger who had broken the monotony of her life
with his presence and left a gentle memory in her
heart

  but it could not be no invention of which human
intellect was capable could break down the barriers
that nature had erected imight feast my soul upon
her wondrous beauty yet she must always remain
ignorant of the adoring eyes that day and night
gazed upon her and even when closed beheld her
in dreams with a bitter cry of anguish i fled from
the room and flinging myself on my bed sobbed
myself to sleep like a child

chapter vi

the spilling of the cup

 arose the next morning almost at daybreak
and rushed to my microscope i trembled as i
sought the luminous world in miniature that
contained my all animula was there i had left
the gas-lamp surrounded by its moderators burn-
ing when i went to bed the night before i found
the sylph bathing as it were with an expression of
pleasure animating her features in the brilliant
light which surrounded her she tossed her lus-
trous golden hair over her shoulders with innocent
coquetry she lay at full length in the transparent
medium in which she supported herself with ease
and gambolled with the enchanting grace that the
nymph salamacis might have exhibited when she
sought to conquer the modest hermaphroditus i
tried an experiment to satisfy myself if her powers
of reflection were developed i lessened the lamp-
light considerably by the dim light that remained
i could see an expression of pain flit across her face
she looked upward suddenly and her brows coi
tracted i flooded the stage of the microscope again
with a full stream of light and her whole expression
changed she sprang forward like some substance
deprived of all weight her eyes sparkled and her
lips moved ah if science had only the means of
conducting and reduplicating sounds as it does the
rays of light what carols of happiness would then
have entranced my ears what jubilant hymns to
adonis would have thrilled the illumined air

  i now comprehended how it was that the count
de gabalis peopled his mystic world with sylphs-
beautiful beings whose breath of life was lambent
fire and who sported forever in regions of purest
ether and purest light the rosicrucian had an-
ticipated the wonder that i had practically realized

the passion grows stronger

how long this worship of my strange divinity
went on thus i scarcely know i lost all note of
time all da from early dawn and far into the
the diamond lens



night i was to be found peering through that won-
derful lens i saw no one went nowhere and scarce
allowed myself sufficient time for my meals my
whole life was absorbed in contemplation as rapt as
that of any of the romish saints every hour that
i gazed upon the divine form strengthened my pas-
sion-a passion that was always overshadowed by
the maddening conviction that although i could
gaze on her at will she never never could behold
me

  at length i grew so pale and emaciated from
want of rest and continual brooding over my insane
love and its cruel conditions that i determined to
make some effort to wean myself from it come
i said this is at best but a fantasy your imagina-
tion has bestowed on animula charms which in
reality she does not possess seclusion from fe-
male society has produced this morbid condition
of mind compare her with the beautiful women
of your own world and this false enchantment will
vanish

the dancer on the stage at niblos garden

i looked over the newspapers by chance therg
i beheld the advertisement of a celebrated dart-
seuse who appeared nightly at niblos the sig-
norina caradolce had the reputation of being the
most beautiful as well as the most graceful woman
in the world i instantly dressed and went to the
theatre

  the curtain drew up the usual semicircle of
fairies in white muslin were standing on the right
toe around the enamelled flower-bank of green can-
vas on which the belated prince was sleeping sud-
denly a flute is heard the fairies start the trees
open the fairies all stand on the left toe and the
queen enters it was the signorina she bounded
forward amid thunders of applause and lighting
on one foot remained poised in air heavens was
this the great enchantress that had drawn monarchs
at her chariot-wheels  those heavy muscular limbs
those thick ankles those cavernous eyes that stereo-
typed smile those crudely painted cheeks where
were the vermeil blooms the liquid expressive eyes
the harmonious limbs of animula

  the signorina danced what gross discordant
movements the play of her limbs was all false and
artificial her bounds were painful athletic efforts
her poses were angular and distressed the eye i
could bear it no longer with an exclamation of dis-
gust that drew every eye upon me i rose from my
seat in the very middle of the signorinas pas-de-
fascination and abruptly quitted the house

  i hastened home to feast my eyes once more on
the lovely form of my sylph i felt that henceforth
to combat this passion would be impossible i ap-
plied my eye to the lens animula was there-but
what could have happened some terrible change
seemed to have taken place during my absence
some secret grief seemed to cloud the lovely fea-

tures of her i gazed upon her face had grown thin
and haggard her limbs trailed heavily the won-
drous lustre of her golden hair had faded she was
ill-ill and i could not assist her i believe at
that moment i would have gladly forfeited all claims
to my human birthright if i could only have been
dwarfed to the size of an animalcule and permitted
to console her from whom fate had forever divided
me

  i racked my brain for the solution of this mys-
tery what was it that afflicted the sylph she
seemed to suffer intense pain her features con-
tracted and she even writhed as if with some in-
ternal agony the wondrous forests appeared also
to have lost half their beauty their hues were dim
and in some places faded away altogether i watched
animula for hours with a breaking heart and she
seemed absolutely to wither away under my very
eye suddenly i remembered that i had not looked
at the water-drop for several days in fact i hated
to see it for it reminded me of the natural barrier
between animula and myself i hurriedly looked
down on the stage of the microscope the slide was
still there-but great heavens the water-drop had
vanished  the awful truth burst upon me it had
evaporated until it had become so minute as to be
invisible to the naked eye i had been gazing on its
last atom the one that contained animula-and
she was dying

the disappearance of animulai

i rushed again to the front of the lens and looked
through alas the last agony had seized her
the rainbow-hued forests had all melted away and
animula lay struggling feebly in what seemed to
be a spot of dim light ah the sight was horrible
the limbs once so round and lovely shrivelling up
into nothings the eyes-those eyes that shone like
heavens-being quenched into black dust the lus-
trous golden hair now lank and discolored the last
throe came i beheld that final struggle of the
blackening form-and i fainted

  when i awoke out of a trance of many hours i
found myself lying amid the wreck of my instru-
ment myself as shattered in mind and body as it i
crawled feebly to my bed from which i did not rise
for months

  they say now that i am mad but they are mis-
taken i am poor for i have neither the heart nor
the will to work all my money is spent and i live on
charity young mens associations that love a joke
invite me to lecture on optics before them for
which they pay me and laugh at me while i lecture
linley the mad microscopist is the name i go by
i suppose that i talk incoherently while i lecture
who could talk sense when his brain is haunted by
such ghastly memories while ever and anon among
the shapes of death i behold the radiant form of my
lost animula

what went before

cosmo versal knoum as an eccentiic astron-
omer has made the astounding discovery
based on mathematical deductions that the world
is on the eve of a second deluge n otwitiistwnding
he is reviled and scoffed at for this announcement
he placards new york with posters calling to all
to harken to his prophecy and to prepare for the
coming flood for his own safety he begins the
building of an enormous ark and barely has it com-
pleted when reports are flashed about the world
that the loaters are actually beginning to rise

  suddenly in midday the world grew dark and
people became terror-stricken the rain descended
from alt invisible source and the waters rose liter-

ally the world sweat but the flood as quickly
abated when light came again and great was the
ridicule heaped upon cosmo and his ark but the
scientist proceeded with the building of his mam-
moth vessel and began to gather the people he had
chosen to accompany him and the animals as well
from all quarters of the earth again came the
darkness upon the land and once more the world
sweat about his ark cosmo had placed electric
wires and when the maddened populace now terri-
fied beyond measure attempted to storm the ark
hundreds fell to the ground shocked and many were
killed

the second deluge

osmos warning to them of the neces-
sity of secrecy was superfluous for the
selfishness of human nature never had
a better illustration than they afforded
the lucky recipients of the invita-
tions stole away without a word of farewell cir-
cumspectly disappearing generally at night and
often in disguise and when the attack occurred on
the ark there were behind the port-holes many
anxious eyes cautiously staring out and recogniz-
ing familiar faces in the mob while the owners of
those eyes trembled in their ahoe lest their
friends might succeed in forcing an entrance af-
ter all it was to be doubted if cosmo versl with
all his vigilance had succeeded in collecting a com-
pany representing anything above the average
quality of the race

 but there was one -----
thing that did great
credit to his heart when
he found that he had
room unoccupied before
adding to his lists he con-
sented to take more than
two children in a family

it was an immense relief
for-it must be recorded
-there were some who
in order to qualify them-
selves had actually aban-
doned members of their 

own families let it also
be said however that 	

many when they found that the conditions impos-
ed were inexorable and that they could only save
themselves by leaving behind others as dear to
them as their own lives indignantly refused and
most of these did not even reply to the invitations

  it was another indication of cosmos real hu-
manity as well as of his shrewdness that as far
as they were known and could be reached the
persons who had thus remained true to the best
instincts of nature were the first to receive a
second invitation with an injunction to bring their
entire families so it happened that after all

 qlowly the -world is sinking below the rising waters

     those who have not as yet bevti drowned admit that
 cosmo versl had been right but it is now too late
 the watery nebula is engulfing the earth and the waters
 will rise until the entire surface of the globe is covered
 to such an extent that even the highest mountain tops will
 be submerged

   in the meanwhile cosmo versdls ark is drifting over
 new uncharted oceans but through a strange freak of
 the nebula it seems that after all versl was not cor-
 rect in his calculations because suddenly the flood stops
 was cosmo versal really wrong and will the flood
 subside these are the vital questions that engross those
 who have fled to the mountain tops

there were aged men and women as well as chil-

dren-in-arras mingled in that remarkable assem-
blage

  it will be recalled that thirteen places had been
specially reserved to be filled by cosmo versals
personal friends his choice of these revealed an-
other pleasing side of his mind he took thirteen
men and women who had been in one capacity or
another employed for many years in his service
some of them were old family servants that had
been in his fathers house

  every one of these persons he said to joseph
smith is worth his weight in gold their disin-
terested fidelity to duty is a type of character that
almost became extinct generations ago and no
more valuable leaven could be introduced into the
society of the future
hbhhbhbn bather than leave them 
would stay behind myself
finally there was the
crew this comprised
one hundred and fifty
members all of them
chosen from the body of
engineers mechanics and
workmen who had been
employed in the construc-
tion of the ark cosmo
himself was of course the
commander but he had
for his lieutenants skilled
hwlbmimlma mariners electrical and
mechanical engineers and
men whom he himself had instructed in the peculiar
duties that would fall to them in the navigation
and management of the ark every detail of which
he had laboriously worked out with a foresight
that seemed all but superhuman

  all of the passengers and crew were aboard
when the baffled mob retreated from mineola and
some-when that danger was past wished to de-
scend to the ground and go and look at the rising
waters which had not yet invaded the neighbor-
hood but cosmo absolutely forbade any depart-
ures from the ark the condensation of the nebula




amazing stories

he declared was likely to begin any minute and
the downpour would be so fierce that a person
might be drowned in the open field

  it came even sooner than he had anticipated
with the results that we had already noted in new
york at first many thought that the ark itself
would be destroyed so dreadful was the impact of
the falling water the women and children and
some of the men were seized with panic and
cosmo had great difficulty in reassuring them

  the flood will not reach us for several hours
yet he said the level of the water must rise at
least a hundred feet more before we shall be afloat
inside here we are perfectly safe the ark is ex-
ceedingly strong and absolutely tight you have
nothing to fear

  then he ordered an ingenious sound-absorbing
screen which he had prepared to be drawn over
the great ceiling of the saloon the effect of which
was to shut out the awful noise of the water roar-
ing upon the roof of the ark a silence that was
at first startling by contrast to the preceding din
prevailed as soon as the screen was in place

  amid a hush of expectancy cosmo now mounted
a dais at one end of the room never before had
the intellectual superiority of the man seemed so
evident his huge dome of thought surmount-
ing his slight body dominated the assembly like
the front of jove chairs near him were occupied
by professor jeremiah moses professor abel
able professor alexander jones and the two
speculative geniuses whom he had named to
joseph smith these were costak theriad of
rumania a tall dark high-browed thinker who
was engaged in devising ways to extract and recover
intra-atomic energy and sir wilfred athelstone
whose specialty was bio-chemistry and who was
said to have produced amazing results in artificial
parthenogenesis and the production of new species

  as soon as attention was concentrated upon him
cosmo versl began to speak

  my friends he said the world around us is
now sinking beneath a flood that will not be ar-
rested until america europe africa asia and
australia have disappeared we stand at the op-
ening of a new age you alone who are here as-
sembled and your descendants will constitute the
population of the new world that is to be

  in this ark which owes its existence to the
foreseeing eye of science you will be borne in
safety upon the bosom of the battling waters and
we will disembark upon the first promising land
that reappears and begin the plantation and de-
velopment of a new society of men and women
which i trust will afford a practical demonstration
of the principles of eugenics

  i have as far as possible and as far as the
pitiful blindness of mankind permitted me to go
selected and assembled here representatives of the
best tendencies of humanity you are a chosen
remnant and the future of this planet depends
upon you

  i have been fortunate in securing the compan-
ionship of men of science who will be able to lead
and direct the ark is fully provisioned for a
period which must exceed the probable duration of
the flood i have taken pains not to overcrowd it

and every preparation has been made for any con-
tingencies which may arise

  it is inexpressibly sad to part thus with the
millions of our fellow beings who would not heed
the warnings that were lavished upon them but
while our hearts may be rent with the thought it
is our duty to cast off the burden of vain regrets
and concentrate all our energies upon the work be-
fore us

  i salute he continued raising his voice and
lifting a glass of wine from the little table before
him the world of the past-may its faults be for-
gotten-and the world of the future-mdfr it rise
on the wings of science to nobler prospects

  he poured out the wine like a libation and as
his voice ceased to echo and he sank into his seat
an uncontrollable wave of emotion ran over the
assembly many of the women wept and the men
conversed in whispers after a considerable inter-
val during which no one spoke above his breath
professor abel abl arose and said

  the gratitude which we owe to this man- in-
dicating cosmo versal can best be expressed not
in words but by acts he has led us thus far he
must continue to lead us to the end we were
blind while he was full of light it will become us
hereafter to heed well whatever he may say i
now wish to ask if he can foresee where upon the
re-emerging planet a foothold is first likely to be
obtained where lies our land of promise

  i can answer that question cosmo replied
only in general terms you are all aware that
the vast table-land of tibet is the loftiest region
upon the globe in its western part it lies from
fourteen to seventeen or eighteen thousand feet
above the ordinary level of the sea above it rise
the greatest mountain-peaks in existence here
the first considerable area is likely to be uncovered
it is upon the pamirs the roof of the world
that we shall probably make our landing

  may i ask said professor abel able in what
manner you expect the waters of the flood to be
withdrawn after the earth is completely
drowned

  that was the reply was one of the funda-
mental questions that i examined but i do not
care to enter into a discussion of it now i may
simply say that it is not only upon the disappear-
ance of the waters that our hopes depend but upon
circumstances that i shall endeavor to make clear
hereafter the new cradle of mankind will be
located near the old one and the roses of the vale
of cashmere will canopy it

  cosmo versls words made a profound impres-
sion upon his hearers and awoke thoughts that
carried their minds off into strange reveries no
more questions were asked and gradually the as-
semblage broke up into groups of interested
talkers

  it was near midnight cosmo beckoning pro-
fessor abel able professor alexander jones
and professor jeremiah moses to accompany him
made his way out of the saloon and secretly open-
ing one of the gangway doors they presently stood
sheltering themselves from the pouring rain in
a position which enabled them to look toward new
york
the second deluge



  nothing of course was visible through the
downpour but they were startled at hearing fear-
ful cries issuing out of the darkness the rural
parts of the city filled with gardens and villas lay
round within a quarter of a mile of the ark and
the sound accelerated by the water-charged at-
mosphere struck upon their ears with terrible
distinctness sometimes when a gust of wind
blew the rain in to their faces the sound deepened
into a long despairing wail which seemed to be
borne from afar off mingled with the roar of the
descending torrent-the death-cry of the vast me-
tropolis 

  merciful heaven i cannot endure this cried
professor moses

  go to my cabin cosmo yelled in his ear and
take the others with you i will join you there in
a little while i wish to measure the rate of rise
of the water

  they gladly left him and fled into the interior
of the ark cosmo procured an electric lamp and
the moment its light streamed out he perceived
that the water had already submerged the great
cradle in which the ark rested and was beginning
to creep up the metallic aides he lowered a grad-
uated tape into it provided with an automatic
register in a few minutes he had completed his
task and then he went to rejoin his late compan-
ions in his cabin

  in about an hour he said to them we shall
be afloat the water is rising at the rate of one-
thirtieth of an inch per second

  no more than that asked professor jones
with an accent of surprise

  that is quite enough cosmo replied one-
thi-rtieth of an inch per second means two inches
in a minute and ten feet in an hour in twenty-
four hours from now the water will stand two hun-
dred and forty feet above its present level and
then only the tallest structures in new york will
lift their tops above it if indeed they are not long
before overturned by undermining or the force
of the waves

  but it will be a jong time before the hills and
highlands are submerged suggested professor
jones are you perfectly sure that the flood will
cover them

  cosmo versl looked at his interlocutor and
slowly shook his head

  it is truly a disappointment to me he said at
length to find that even now remnants of doubt
cling to your minds i tell you that the nebula is
condensing at its maximum rate it is likely to
continue to do so for at least four months in four
months at the rate of two inches per minute the
level of the water will rise  feet there is
only one peak in the world which is surely known
to attain a slightly greater height than that-
mount everest in the himalayas even in a sin-
gle month the rise will amount to  feet that
is  feet higher than the loftiest mountain in
the appalachians in one month then there will
be nothing visible of north america east of the
rockies and in another month they will have
gone under

  not another word was said the three profes-
sors sat wide-eyed and open-mouthed staring at

cosmo versdl whose bald head was crowned with
an aureole by the electric light that beamed from
the ceiling while with a gold pocket-pencil he fell
to figuring upon a sheet of paper

chapter x

the last day of new york

while cosmo versl was calculating from
the measured rise of the water the rate
of condensation of the nebula and finding
that it added twenty-nine trillion two hundred and
ninety billion tons to the weight of the earth every
minute-a computation that seemed to give him
great mental satisfaction-the metropolis of the
world whose nucleus was the island of manhattan
and every other town and city on the globe that
lay near the ordinary level of the sea was swiftly
sinking beneath the swelling flood

  everywhere over all the broad surface of the
planet a wail of despair arose from the perishing
millions beaten down by the water that poured
from the unpitying sky even on the highlands
the situation was but little better than in the val-
leys the hills seemed to have been turned
into the crests of cataracts from which tor-
rents of water rushed down on all sides stripping
the soil from the rocks and sending the stones and
boulders roaring and leaping into the lowland and
the gorges farmhouses barns villas trees ani-
mals human beings-all were swept away together

  only on broad elevated plateaus where higher
points rose above the general level were a few
of the inhabitants able to find a kind of refuge by
seeking these high places and sheltering them-
selves as best they could among immovable rocks
they succeeded at least in delaying their fate not-
withstanding the fact that the atmosphere was filled
with falling water they could yet breathe if they
kept the rain from striking directly in their faces
it was owing to this circumstance and to some
extraordinary occurrences which we shall have to
relate that the fate of the human race was not
precisely that which cosmo versal had predicted

  we quitted the scene in new york when the
shadow of night had just fallen and turned the
gloom of the watery atmosphere into impenetrable
darkness the events of that dreadful night we
shall not attempt to depict when the hours of day-
light returned and the sun should have brightened
over the doomed city only a faint phosphorescent
luminosity filled the sky it was just sufficient to
render objects dimly visible if the enclosing
nebula had remained in a cloud-like state it would
have cut off all light but having condensed into
rain-drops which streamed down in parallel lines
except when sudden blasts of wind swept them into
a confused mass the sunlight was able to penetrate
through the interstices aided by the transparency
of the water and so a slight but variable illumina-
tion was produced

  in this unearthly light many tall structures of ths
metropolis which had as yet escaped the effects of
undermining by the rushing torrents in the streets
towered dimly toward the sky shedding streams of
water from every cornice most of the buildings


amazing stories

of only six or eight stories had already been sub-
merged with the exception of those that stood on
high grounds in the upper part of the island and
about spuyten duyvil

  in the towers and upper stories of the lofty
buildings still standing in the heart of the city
crowds of unfortunates assembled gazing with
horror at the spectacles around them and wringing
their hands in helpless despair when the light
brightened they could see below them the angry
water creeping every instant closer to their places
of refuge beaten into foam by the terrible down-
pour and sometimes moved by a mysterious im-
pulse rising in sweeping waves which threatened
to carry everything before them

  every few minutes one of the great structures
would sway crack crumble and go down into the
seething flood the cries of the perishing being
swallowed up in the thunder of the fall and when
this occurred within sight of neighboring towers
yet intact men and women could be seen some with
children in their arms madly throwing themselves
from windows and ledges seeking quick death now
that hope was no more

  strange and terrible scenes were enacted in the
neighborhood of what had been the water-fronts
most of the vessels moored there had been virtually
wrecked by the earlier invasion of the sea some
had been driven upon the shore others had careened
and been swamped at their wharves but a few
had succeeded in cutting loose in time to get fairly
afloat some tried to go out to sea but were wreck-
ed by running against obstacles or by being swept
over the jersey flats some met their end by crash-
ing into the submerged pedestal of the statue of
liberty others steered up the course of the hud-
son river but that had become a narrow sea filled
with floating and tossing dbris of every sort and
all landmarks being invisible the luckless naviga-
tors lost their way and perished either through
collisions with other vessels or by driving upon a
rocky shore

  the fate of the gigantic building containing the
offices of the municipal government which for a
century had stood near the ancient city hall and
which had been the culminating achievement of the
famous epoch of sky-scrapers was a thing so
singular and at the same time dramatic that in a
narrative dealing with les extraordinary events
than we are obliged to record it would appear alto-
gether incredible

  with its two-score lofty stories and its massive
base this wonderful structure rose above the lower
quarter of the city and dominated it like a verit-
able tower of babel made to defy the flood many
thousands of people evidently regarded it in that
very light and they had fled from all quarters as
soon as the great downpour began to find refuge
within its mountainous flanks there were men-
clerks merchants brokers from the down-town
offices and women and children from neighboring
tenements

  by good chance but a few weeks before this
building had been fitted with a newly invented sys-
tem of lighting by which each story was supplied
with electricity from a small dynamo of its own

and so it happened that now the lamps within were
all aglow lightening the peoples hearts a little
with their cheering radiance

  up and up they climbed the water ever following
at their heels from floor to floor until ten of the
great stages were submerged but there were more
than twice as many stages yet above and they
counted them with unexpiring hope telling one an-
other with the assurance of desperation that long
before the flood could attain so stupendous an alti-
tude the rain would surely cease and the danger
as far as they were concerned would pass away

  see see cries one it is stopping it is
coming no higher ive been watching that step
and the water has stopped it hasnt risen for ten
minutes

  hurrah hurrah yells the crowd behind and
above and the glad cry is taken up and rever-
berated from story to story until it bursts wildly
out into the rain-choked air at the very summit

  hurrah hurrah we are saved the flood
has stopped

  men madly embrace each other women burst
into tears and hug their children to their breasts
filled with a joy and thankfulness that can find no
words

  you are wrong says another man crouched
beside him who first spoke it has not stopped-
it is still rising

  what i tell you it has stopped snaps the
other look at that step it stopped right below
it

  youve been watching the wrong step its ris-
ing 

  you fool shut your mouth i say it has
stopped

  no it has not

  it has it has

  look at that step then see the water just now
coming over it

  the obstinate optimist stares a moment turns
pale and then with an oath strikes his more clear-
headed neighbor in the face and the excited crowd
behind with the blind instinctive feeling that some-
how he has robbed them of the hope which was but
now as the breath of life to them strike him and
curse him too

  but he had seen only too clearly

  with the steady march of fate-two inches a
minute as cosmo versfil had accurately measured
it-the water still advances and climbs upward

  in a little while they were driven to another story
and then to another but hope would not down
they could not believe that the glad news which
had so recently filled them with joy was altogether
false the water must have stopped rising once
it had been seen then it would surely stop again
stop to rise no more

  poor deluded creatures with the love of life
so strong within them they could not picture in
their affrighted minds the terrible consummation
to which they were being slowly driven when jam-
med into the narrow chambers dv the very top of the
mighty structure their remorseless enemy would
seize them at last

  but they were nearer the end than they could
the second deluge



have imagined even if they had accepted and coolly
reasoned upon the facts that were so plain before
them and after all it was not to come upon
them until after they had fought their way to the
highest loft and into the last corner

  a link of this strange chain of fatal events now
belongs to the spot where the united states navy
yard in brooklyn once existed that place was
sunk deep beneath the waters all of the cruisers
battleships and other vessels that had been at
anchor or at moorings there had gone under one
only the boast of the american navy the uncon-
querable uncle sam which in the last great war
that the world had known had borne the starry flag
to victories whose names broke mens voices and
filled their eyes with tears of pride had escaped
through the incomparable seamanship of capt
robert decatur who had been her commander for
thirty years

  but though the uncle sam managed to float upon
the rising flood she was unable to get away be-
cause of the obstructions lodged about the great
bridges that spanned the east river a curious
eddy that the raging currents formed over what
was once the widest part of that stream kept her
revolving round and round never departing far
in any direction and with majestic strength riding
down or brushing aside the floating timbers wooden
houses and other wreckage that pounded against
her mighty steel sides

  just at the time when the waters had mounted
to the eighteenth story of the beleaguered municipal
building a sudden change occurred in these cur-
rents they swept westward with resistless force
and the uncle sam was carried directly over the
drowned city first she encountered the cables of
the manhattan bridge striking them near the west-
ern tower and swinging round wrenched the tower
itself from its foundations and hurled it beneath
the waters

  then she rushed on riding with the turbid flood
high above the buried roofs finding no other ob-
struction in her way until she approached the
municipal building which was stoutly resisting the
push of the waves

  those who were near the windows and on the
balconies on the eastern side of the building saw
the great battleship coming out of the gray gloom
like some diluvian monster and before they could
comprehend what it was it crashed prow on into
the steel-ribbed walls driving them in as if they
had been the armored sides of an enemy

  so tremendous was the momentum of the strik-
ing mass that the huge vessel passed like a pro-
jectile through walls and floors and partitions
but as she emerged in the central court the whole
vast structure came thundering down upon her and
ship and building together sank beneath the boil-
ing waves

  but out of the awful tangle of steel girders that
whipped the air and the water as if some terrible
spidery life yet clung to them by one of those
miracles of chance which defy all the laws of
probability and reason a small boat of levium that
had belonged to the uncle sam was cast forth and
floated away half submerged but unsinkable and

clinging to its thwarts struggling for breath in-
sane with terror were two men the sole survivors
of all those thousands

  one of them was a seaman who had taken ref-
uge with a crowd of comrades in the boat before
the battleship rushed down upon the building all
of his comrades had been hurled out and lost when
the blow came while his present companion was
swept in and lodged against the thwarts and so
those two waifs drove off in the raging waves both
of them were bleeding from many wounds but
they had no fatal hurts

  the boat though filled with water was so light
that it could not sink moreover it was ballasted
and amid all its wild gyrations it kept right side
up even the ceaseless downpour from the sky
could not drive it beneath the waves

  after a while the currents that had been setting
westward changed their direction and the boat
was driven toward the north it swept on past
toppling sky-scrapera until it was over the place
where madison square once spread its lawns looked
down upon by gigantic structures most of which
had now either crumbled and disappeared or were
swaying to their fall here there was an eddy and
the boat turned round and round amid floating
debris until two other draggled creatures who had
been clinging to floating objects succeeded by des-
perate efforts in pulling themselves into it others
tried but failed and no one lent a helping hand
those who were already in the boat neither opposed
nor aided the efforts of those who battled to enter
it no words were heard in the fearful uproar-
only inarticulate cries

  suddenly the current changed again and the
boat with its dazed occupants was hurried off
in the direction of the hudson night was now
beginning once more to drop an obscuring curtain
over the scene and under that curtain the last
throes of drowning new york were hidden when
the sun again faintly illuminated the western hem-
isphere the whole atlantic seaboard was buried
under the sea

  as the water rose higher cosmo versals ark
at last left its cradle and cumbrously floated off
moving first eastward then turning in the direction
of brooklyn and manhattan cosmo had his engines
in operation but their full power was not developed
as soon as he had expected and the great vessel
drifted at the will of the currents and the wind
the latter coming now from one side and now from
another rising at times to hurricane strength and
then dying away until only a spanking breeze swept
the ever-falling rain into swishing sheets occa-
sionally the wind failed entirely and for many
minutes at a time the water fell in vertical streams

  at length the motive power of the ark was de-
veloped and it began to obey its helm from the
shelter of a captains bridge constructed at the
forward end of the huge levium dome that covered
the vessel cosmo versal with captain arms a
veteran navigator in whose skill he confided peered
over the interminable waste of waters there was
nothing in sight except floating objects that had
welled up from the drowned city and the surround-


amazing stories

ing villages here and there the body of an animal
or of a human being was seen in the tossing waves
and cosmo versal sadly shook his head as he point-
ed them out but the stout mariner at his side
chewed his tobacco and paid attention only to his
duties shouting orders from time to time through
a speaking-tube or touching an electric button

  cosmo versl brought a rain-gauge and again
and again allowed it to fill itself the story was
always the same-two inches per minute ten feet
per hour the water mounted

  the nebula had settled down to regular work
and if cosmos calculations were sound there
would be no intermission for four months

  after the power of the propellers had been de-
veloped the ark was steered south-eastward its
progress was very slow in the course of eight
hours it had not gone more than fifty miles the
night came on and the speed was reduced until there
was only sufficient way to insure the command of
the vessels movements powerful search-lights
were employed as long as the stygian darkness
continued

  with the return of the pallid light at what
should have been daybreak cosmo and his navigator
were again at their post in fact the former had
not slept at all keeping watch through the long
hours with captain arms within easy call

  as the light became stronger cosmo said to the
captain

  steer toward new york i wish to see if the
last of the tall buildings on the upper heights have
gone under

  it will be very dangerous to go that way
objected captain arms there are no landmarks
and we may strike a snag

  not if we are careful replied cosmo all
but the highest ground is now buried very deep

  it is taking a fools risk growled captain
arms but nevertheless he obeyed

  it was true that they had nothing to go by the
air was too thick with water and the light too
feeble for them to be able to lay their course by
sighting the distant hills of new jersey which yet
remained above the level of the flood still by a
kind of seamans instinct captain arms made his
way until he felt that he ought to venture no
farther he had just turned to cosmo versal with
the intention of voicing his protest when the ark
careened slightly shivered from stem to stern and
then began a bumping movement that nearly threw
the two men from their feet

  we are aground cried the captain and in-
stantly turned a knob that set in motion automatic
machinery which cut off the engines from the pro-
pellers and at the same time slowed down the
engines themselves

chapter xi

a billion for a share

tte ark had lodged on the loftiest part of the
palisades it was only after long and careful
study of their position rendered possible by
occasional glimpses of the orange hills and high
points further up the course of the hudson that

cosmo versl and captain arms were able to
reach that conclusion where new york had stood
nothing was visible but an expanse of turbid and
rushing water

  but suppose the hard trap rocks had penetrated
the bottom of the ark it was a contingency too
terrible to be thought of yet the facts must be
ascertained at once

  cosmo calling joseph smith and commanding
him to go among the frightened passengers and as-
sure them in his name that there was no danger
hurried with the captain and a few trusty men into
the bowels of the vessel they thoroughly sounded
the bottom plates no aperture and no indentation
was to be found

  but then the bottom was double and the outer
plates might have been perforated if this had
happened the fact would reveal itself through the
leakage of water into the intervening space to
ascertain if that had occurred it was necessary to
unscrew the covers of some of the manholes in the
inner skin of levium

  it was an anxious moment when they cautiously
removed one of these covers at the last turns of
the screw the workman who handled it instinctively
turned his head aside and made ready for a spring
more than half expecting that the cover would be
driven from his hands and a stream of water would
burst in

  but the cover remained in place after it was
completely loosened and until it had been lifted
off a sigh of relief broke from every breast no
water was visible

  climb in there and explore the bottom cosmo
commanded

  there was a space of eighteen inches between
the two bottoms which were connected and braced
by the curved ribs of the hull a man immediately
disappeared in the opening and began the explora-
tion cosmo ordered the removal of other covers
at various points and the exploration was extended
over the whole bottom he himself passed through
one of the manholes and aided in the work

  at last it was determined beyond any doubt
that even the outer skin was uninjured not so
much as a dent could be found in it

  by the favor of providence said cosmo versal
as his head emerged from a manhole the ark
has touched upon a place where the rocks are cover-
ed with soil and no harm has come to us in a very
short time the rising water will lift us off

  and with my consent youll do no more navigat-
ing over hills and mountains grumbled captain
arms the open sea for the sailor

  the covers were carefully replaced and the party
in happier spirits returned to the upper decks
where the good news was quickly spread

  the fact was that while the inspection was un-
der way the ark had floated off and when cosmo
and the captain reached their bridge the man who
had been left in charge reported that the vessel
had swung halfway round

  shes headed for the old atlantic sung out
captain arms the sooner were off the better

  but before the captain could signal the order
the second deluge



to go ahead cosmo versl laid his hand on his
arm and said

  wait a moment listen

  through the lashing oi the rain a voice pene-
trated with a sound between a call and a scream
there could be no doubt that it was human the
captain and cosmo looked at one another in speech-
less astonishment the idea that any one outside
the ark could have survived and could now be
afloat amid this turmoil of waters had not occurred
to their minds they experienced a creeping of
the nerves in a few minutes the voice came again
louder than before and the words that it pronoun-
ced being now clearly audible the two listeners
could not believe their ears

  cosmo versal it yelled cosm-o-o ver-sa-al
a billion for a share a billion i say a bil-li-on
for a share i

  then they perceived a little way off to the left
something which looked like the outline of a boat
sunk to the gunwales washed over by every wave
and standing in it up to their knees in water were
four men one of whom was gesticulating violently
while the others seemed dazed and incapable of
voluntary movement

  it was the boat of levium that had been thrown
out of the wreckage when the battleship ran down
the municipal tower and we must now follow the
thread of its adventures up to the time of its en-
counter with the ark

  as the boat was driven westward from the drown-
ed site of madison square it gradually freed itself
from the objects floating around most of which
soon sunk and in an hour or two its inmates were
alone-the sole survivors of a population of many
millions

  alone they were in impenetrable darkness for
as we have said night had by this time once more
fallen they floated on half drowned chilled to
the bone not trying to speak not really conscious
of one anothers presence the rain beat down
upon them the waves washed over them the un-
sinkable boat sluggishly rose and fell with the heav-
ing of the water and occasionally they were nearly
flung overboard by a sudden lurch-and yet they
clung with desperate tenacity to the thwarts as
if life were still dear as if they thought that they
might yet survive though the world was drowned

  thus hours passed and at last a glimmer appear-
ed in the streaming air and a faint light stole over
the face of the water if they saw one another it
was with unrecognizing eyes they were devoured
with hunger but they did not know it

  suddenly one of them-it was he who had been
so miraculously thrown into the boat when it shot
out of the tangle of falling beams and walls-raised
his head and threw up his arms a wild light gleam-
ing in his eyes

  in a hoarse screaming voice he yelled

  cosmo versal

  no other syllables that the tongue could shape
would have produced the effect of that name it
roused the three men who heard it from their
lethargy of despair and thrilled them to the mar-
row with amazed eyes they stared at their com-
panion he did not look at them but gazed off

into the thick rain again his voice rose in a ma-
niacal shriek

  cosmo versal do you hear me let me in
a billion for a share

  the men looked at each other and even in their
desperate situation felt a stir of pity in their
hearts they were not too dazed to comprehend
that their companion had gone mad one of them
moved to his side and laid a hand upon his shoulder
as if he would try to soothe him

  but the maniac threw him off nearly precipita-
ting him over the side of the submerged boat cry-
ing

  what are you doing in my boat over-board
with you i am looking for cosmo versal hes
got the biggest thing afloat securities securities
gilt-edged a billion i tell you here i have
them-look gilt-edged every one and he snatch-
ed a thick bundle of papers from his pocket and
waved them wildly until they melted into a pulpy
mass with the down-pour

  the others now shrank away from him in fear
fear yes for still they loved their lives and
the staggering support beneath their feet had be-
come as precious to them as the solid earth they
would have fought with the fury of madmen to re-
tain their places in that half-swamped shell they
were still capable of experiencing a keener fear
than that of the flood they were as terrified by
the presence of this maniac as they would have been
on encountering him in their homes

  but he did not attempt to follow them he still
looked off through the driving rain balancing him-
self to the sluggish lurching of the boat and con-
tinued to rave and shout and shake his soaked
bundle of papers until exhausted by his efforts
and half-choked by the water that drove in his
face he sank helpless upon a thwart

  then they fell back into their lethargy but in
a little while he was on his feet again gesticulating
and raging-and thus hours passed on and still
they were afloat and still clinging to life

  suddenly looming out of the strange gloom
they perceived the huge form of the ark and all
struggled to their feet but none could find voice
but the maniac

  as soon as he saw the men cosmo versal had
run down to the lowest deck and ordered the open-
ing of a gangway on that side when the door
swung back he found himself within a few yards
of the swamped boat but ten feet above its level
joseph smith professor moses professor jones
professor able and others of the passengers and
several of the crew hurried to his side while the
rest of the passengers crowded as near as they
could get

  the instant that cosmo appeared the maniac re-
doubled his cries

  here they are he yelled shaking what remain-
ed of his papers a billion-all gilt-edged let
me in but shut out the others theyre only little
fellows theyve got no means they cant float
an enterprise like this ah youre a bright one
you and me cosmo versl-well squeeze em all
out ill give you the secrets well own the earth

im amos blank
amazing stories



  cosmo versl recognized the man in spite of the
dreadful change that had come over him his
face was white and drawn his eyes staring his
head bare his hair matted with water his cloth-
ing in shreds-but it was unmistakably amos
blank a man whobe features the newspapers had
rendered familiar to millions a man who had for
years stood before the public as the unabashed
representative of the system of remorseless repres-
sion of competition and shameless corruption of
justice and legislation- after the world for nearly
three generations had enjoyed the blessings of the
reforms in business methods and social ideals that
had been inaugurated by the great uprising of the
people in the first quarter of the twentieth century
amos blank and lesser men of his ilk had swung
back the pendulum and reestablished more firmly
than ever the reign of monopoly and iniquitous
privilege

  the water-logged little craft floated nearer until
it almost touched the side of the ark directly below
the gangway the madmans eyes glowed with
eagerness and he reached up his papers continually
yelling his refrain a billion gilt-edged let
me in dont give the rabble a show

  cosmo made no reply but gazed down upon the
man and his bedraggled companions with impassive
features but thoughtful eyes any one who knew
him intimately as joseph smith alone did could
have read his mind he was asking himself what
he ought to do here was the whole fundamental
question to be gone over again to what purpose
had he taken so great pains to select the flower
of mankind here was the head and chief of the
offense that he had striven to eliminate appealing
to him to be saved under circumstances which went
straight to the heart and awoke every sentiment
of humanity

  presently he said in as low a voice as could be
made audible

  joseph advise me what should i do

  you were willing to take professor pludder
replied smith evasively but with a plain leaning to
the side of mercy

  you know very well that that was different
cosmo returned irritably pludder was not morally
rotten he was only mistaken he had the funda-
mental scientific quality and im sorry he threw
himself away in his obstinacy but this man-
since he is alone broke in joseph smith with
a sudden illumination he could do no harm
cosmo versals expression instantly brightened
you are right he exclaimed by himself he
can do nothing i am sure there is no one aboard
who would sympathize with his ideas alone he
is innocuous besides hes insane and i cant leave
him to drown in that condition and i must take the
others too let down a landing stage he con-
tinued in a louder voice addressing some members
of the crew

  in a few minutes all four of the unfortunates
seeming more dead than alive were helped into the
ark

  amos blank immediately precipitated himself
upon cosmo versal and seizing him by the arm
tried to lead him apart saying in his ear as he

glared round upon the faces of the throng which
crowded every available space

  hist overboard with em whats all this
trash shovel em out theyll want to get in
with us theyll queer the game

  then he turned furiously upon the persons near-
est him and began to push them toward the open
gangway at a signal from cosmo versal two
men seized him and pinioned his arms at that his
mood changed and wrenching himself loose he
onoe more ran to cosmo waving his bedraggled
bundle and shouting

  a billion heres the certificates-gilt-edge
but he continued with a cunning leer and sud-
denly thrusting the sodden papers into his pocket
youll make out the receipts first ill put in five
billions to make it a sure go if you wont let in an-
other soul

  cosmo shook off the mans grasp and again call-
ing the two members of the crew who had before
pinioned his arms told them to lead him away at
the same time saying to him

  you go with these men into my room ill see
you later

  blank took it in the best part and willingly ac-
companied his conductors only stopping a moment
to wink over his shoulder at cosmo and then he
was led through the crowd which regarded him
with unconcealed astonishment and in many cases
with no small degree of fear as soon as he was
beyond earshot cosmo directed joseph smith to
hurry ahead of the party and conduct them to a
particular apartment which he designated at the
same time saying to smith

  turn the key on him as soon as hes inside
amos blank now an insane prisoner in cosmo
versdls ark had been the greatest financial power
in the worlds metropolis a man of iron nerve and
the clearest of brains who always kept his head and
never uttered a foolish word it was he who had
stood over the flight of steps in the municipal build-
ing coolly measuring with his eye the rise of the
water exposing the terrible error that sent such
a wave of unreasoning joy through the hearts of the
thousands of refugees crowded into the doomed
edifice and receiving blows and curses for making
the truth known

  he had himself taken refuge there after visiting
his office and filling his pockets with his most preci-
ous papers how by a marvelous stroke of fate he
became one of the four persons who alone escaped
from new york after the downpour began is al-
ready known	t
the other men taken from the boat were treated
like rescued mariners snatched from a wreck at
sea every attention was lavished upon them and
cosmo versal did not appear to regret as far as
they were concerned that his ships company had
been so unexpectedly recruited

chapter xii
submergence of the old world

we now turn our attention for a time from
the new world to the old what did the
thronging populations of europe africa
the second deluge

 

and asia do when the signs of coming disaster
chased one another when the swollen oceans be-
gan to burst their bonds and when the windows of
the firmament were opened

  the picture that can be drawn must necessarily
be very fragmentary because the number who es-
caped was small and the records that they left are
few

  the savants of the older nations were in gen-
eral quite as incredulous and as set in their opposi-
tion to cosmo versils extraordinary outgivings as
those of america they decried his science and de-
nounced his predictions as the work of a fool or a
madman the president of the royal astronomical
society of great britain proved to the satisfaction
of most of his colleagues that a nebula could not
possibly contain enough water to drown an asteroid
let alone the earth

   the nebulae said this learned astronomer amid
the plaudits of his hearers are infinitely rarer in
composition than the rarest gas left in the receiver
of an exhausted air-pump i would undertake to
swallow from a wine-glass the entire substance of
any nebula that could enter the space between the
earth and the sun if it were condensed into the
liquid state

  it might be intoxicating called out a face-
tious member

   will the chair permit me to point out said an-
other with great gravity that such a proceeding
would be eminently rash for the nebulous fluid
might be highly poisonous hear hear i and
laaghterl

  what do you say of this strange darkness and
these storms asked an earnest-looking man
this meeting was held after the terrors of the
third sign had occurred

   i say replied the president that that is the
affair of the meteorological society and has noth-
ing to do with astronomy i dare say that they can
account for it

   and i dare say they cant cried a voice

  heari hear who are you put him outl
i dare say hes right cosmo versl every-
body was talking at once

will this gentleman identify himself asked
the president will he please explain his words
that i will said a tall man with long whisk-
ers rising at the rear end of the room i am
pretty well known i-

  its jameson the astrologer cried a voice
whats he doing here

  yes said the whiskered man its jameson
the astrologer and he has come here to let you
know that cosmo versl was born under the sign
cancer the first of the watery triplicity and that
berosus the chaldean declared-

  an uproar immediately ensued half the mem-
bers were on their feet at once there was a scuffle
in the back part of the room and jameson the as-
trologer was hustled out shouting at the top of
his voice

   berosus the chaldean predicted that the world
would be drowned when all the planets should as-
semble in the sign cancer-and where are they

now blind and stupid dolts that you are-where
are they now

  it was some time before order could be restored
and a number of members disappeared having fol-
lowed jameson the astrologer possibly through
sympathy or possibly with a desire to learn more
about the prediction of berosus the father of as-
trology

  when those who remained and who constituted
the great majority of the membership had quieted
down the president remarked that the interruption
which they had just experienced was quite in line
with all the other proceedings of the disturbers of
public tranquillity who under the lead of a crazy
american charlatan were trying to deceive the ig-
norant multitude but they would find themselves
seriously in error if they imagined that their ab-
surd ideas were going to be taken over in eng-
land	

  i dare say he concluded that there is some
scheme behind it all

  another american trust cried a voice

  the proceedings were finally brought to an end
but not before a modest member had risen in hia
place and timidly remarked that there was one
question that he would like to put to the chair-
one thing that did not seem to have been made
quite clear-where were the planets now

  a volley of hoots mingled with a few hears
constituted the only reply

  scenes not altogether unlike this occurred in the
other great learned societies-astronomical meteor-
ological and geological the official representatives
of science were virtually unanimous in condemna-
tion of cosmo versal and in persistent assertion
that nothing that had occurred was inexplicable by
known laws but in no instance did they make it
clear to anybody precisely what were the laws that
they invoked or how it happened that cosmo ver-
si had been able to predict so many strange things
which everybody knew really had come to pass
such as the sudden storms and the great darkness

  we are still it must not be forgotten dealing
with a time anterior to the rising of the sea

  the paris academy of sciences voted that the
subject was unworthy of serious investigation and
similar action was taken in berlin leningrad vi-
enna and elsewhere

  but among the people at large universal alarm
prevailed and nothing was so eagerly read as the
despatches from new york detailing the proceed-
ings of cosmo versil and describing the progress
of his great levium ark in england many procured
copies of cosmos circulars in which the proper
methods to be pursued in the construction of arks
were carefully set forth some set to work to build
such vessels but following british methods of
construction they doubled the weight of everything
with the result that if cosmo had seen what they
were about he would have told them that such arks
would go to the bottom faster than to the top

  in germany the balloon idea took full possession
of the public mind germany had long before de-
veloped the greatest fleet of dirigibles in existence
preferring them to every other type of flying ap-
paratus it was reported that if worst came to


amazing stories

worst the best manner of meeting the emergency
would be by the multiplication of dirigibles and the
increase of their capacity

  the result was that a considerable number of
wealthy germans began the construction of such
vessels but when interviewed they denied that
they were preparing for a flood they said that
they simply wished to enlarge and increase the num-
ber of their pleasure craft all this was in con-
temptuous defiance of the warning which cosmo
versl had been careful to insert in his circulars
that balloons and aeros of all kinds will be of no
use whatever the only safety will be found in arks
and they must be provisioned for at least five
years

  the most remarkable thing of all happened in
france it might naturally have been expected that
a frenchman who thought it worth his while to
take any precautions against the extinction of the
human race would when it became a question of a
flood have turned to the aero for from the com-
mencement of aerial navigation french engineers
had maintained an unquestionable superiority in
the construction and perfection of that kind of ma-
chine

  their aeros could usually fly longer and carry
more dead weight than those of any other nation
in the transoceanic aero races which occasionally
took place the french furnished the most daring
and the most frequently successful competitors

  then too the french mind is masterly in ap-
preciation of details and cosmo versals reasons
for condemning the aero and the balloon as means
of escaping the flood were promptly divined in the
first place it was seen that no kind of airship could
be successfully provisioned for a flight of indefinite
length and in the second place the probable strength
of the winds or the crushing weight of the de-
scending water in case as cosmo predicted a
nebula should condense upon the earth would
either sweep an aero or a balloon to swift destruc-
tion or carry it down into the waves like a water-
soaked butterfly

  accordingly when a few frenchmen began seri-
ously to consider the question of providing a way
of escape from the flood-always supposing for
the sake of argument that there would be a flood
-they got together under the leadership of an en-
gineer officer named yves de beauxchamps and dis-
cussed the matter in all its aspects they were not
long in arriving at the conclusion that the best
thing that could possibly be done woyld be to con-
struct a submarine

  in fact this was almost an inevitable conclusion
for them because before the abandonment of sub-
marines in war on account of their too great pow-
ers of destruction-a circumstance which had also
led to the prohibition of the use of explosive bombs
in the aerial navies-the french had held the lead
in the construction and management of submers-
ible vessels even more decisively than in the case of
aeros	

  a large submarine said de beauxchamps in-
to whose construction a certain amount of levium
entered would possess manifest advantages over
versals ark it could be provisioned to any extent

desired it would escape the discomforts of the
waves winds and flooding rain and it could easily
rise to the surface whenever that might be desir-
able for change of air it would have all the am-
phibious advantages of a whale

  the others were decidedly of de beauxchampss
opinion and it was enthusiastically resolved that a
vessel of this kind should be begun at once

  if we dont need it for a flood said de beaux-
champs we can employ it for a pleasure vessel to
visit the wonders of the deep we will then make
a reality of that marvelous dream of our country-
man of old that prince of dreamers jules verne

  lets name it for him cried one

  admirable charming they all exclaimed
vive le jules verne

  within two days but without the knowledge of
the public the keel of the submersible jules verne
was laid but we shall hear of that remarkable
craft again

  while animated and in some cases violent dis-
cussions were taking place in the learned circles of
europe and a few were making ready in such man-
ner as they deemed most effective for possible con-
tingencies waves of panic swept over the remain-
der of the old world there were yet hundreds of
millions in africa and asia to whom the advantages
of scientific instruction had not extended but who
while still more or less under the dominion of ig-
norance and superstition were in touch with the
news of the whole planet

  the rumor that a wise man in america had dis-
covered that the world was to be drowned was not
long in reaching the most remote recess of the
african forests and of the boundless steppes of the
greater continent and however it might be rid-
iculed or received with skeptical smiles in the
strongholds of civilization it met with ready be-
lief in less enlightened minds

  then the three signs-the first great heat
the onslaught of storm and lightning and the
noche triste the great darkness-had been world-
wide in their effects and each had heightened the
terror caused by its predecessor moreover in the
less enlightened parts of the world the reassurances
of the astronomers and others did not penetrate at
all or if they did had no effect for not only does
bad news run while good news walks but it talks
faster

  it will be recalled that one of the most disquiet-
ing incidents in america immediately preceding
the catastrophic rising of the oceans was the melt-
ing of the arctic snows and ice-fields with conse-
quent inundations in the north this stage in the
progress of the coming disaster was accentuated in
europe by the existence of the vast glaciers of the
alps the rocky mountains in their middle
course had relatively little snow and almost no
true glaciers and consequently there were no scenes
of this kind in the united states comparable with
those that occurred in the heart of europe

  after the alarm caused by the great darkness in
september had died out and the long spell of con-
tinuous clear skies began the summer resorts of
switzerland were crowded as they had seldom been
people were driven there by the heat for one thing
the second deluge



and then owing to the early melting of the win-
ters deposit of snow the alps presented them-
selves in a new aspect

  mountain-climbers found it easy to make ascents
upon peaks which had always hitherto presented
great difficulties on account of the vast snow-fields
seamed with dangerous crevasses which hung upon
their flanks these were now so far removed that
it was practicable for amateur climbers to go where
always before only trained alpinists accompanied
by the most experienced guides dared to venture

  but as the autumn days ran on and on new snows
fell the deep-seated glaciers began to dissolve and
masses of ice that had lain for untold centuries in
the mighty laps of the mountains projecting their
frozen noses into the valleys came tumbling down
partly in the form of torrents of water and partly
in roaring avalanches

  the great aletsch glacier was turned into a river
that swept down into the valley of the rhne carry-
ing everything before it the glaciers at the head
of the rhone added their contribution the whole
of the bernese oberland seemed to have suddenly
been dissolved like a huge mass of sugar candy
and on the north the valley of interlaken was inun-
dated while the lakes of thun and brientz were
lost in an inland sea which rapidly spread over all
the lower lands between the alps and the swiss
jura

  farther north the rhine swollen by the continual
descent of the glacier water burst its banks and
broadened out until strasbourgh lay under water
with the finger of its ancient cathedral helplessly
pointing skyward out of the midst of the flood
all the ancient cities of the great valley from
basle to mayence saw their streets inundated and
the foundations of their most precious architectural
monuments undermined by the searching water

  the swollen river reared back at the narrow pass
through the taunus range and formed a huge eddy
that swirled over the old city of bingen then
it tore down between the castle-crowned heights
sweeping away the villages on the river banks from
bingen to coblentz lashing the projecting rocks
of the lorelei and carrying off houses churches
and old abbeys in a rush of ruin

 it widened out as it approached bonn and
cologne but the water was still deep enough to
inundate those cities and finally it spread over the
plain of holland finding a score of new mouths
through which to pour into the german ocean
while the reclaimed area of the zuyder zee once
more joined the ocean and amsterdam and the
other cities of the netherlands were flooded in
many cases to the tops of the house doors

  west and south the situation was the same the
mer de glace at chamonix and all the other
glaciers of the mont blanc range disappeared
sending floods down to geneva and over the dau-
phiny and down into the plains of piedmont and
lombardy the ruin was tremendous and the loss
of life incalculable geneva turin milan and
a hundred other cities were swept by torrents

  the rapidity of this melting of the vast snow-
beds and glaciers of the alps was inconceivable
and the effect of the sudden denudation upon the

mountains themselves was ghastly their seamed
cavernous sides stood forth gaunt and naked a
revelation of nature in her most fearful aspects
such as men had never looked upon mont blanc
without its blanket of snow and ice towered like
the blackened ruin of a fallen world a sight that
made the beholders shudder

  but this flood ended as suddenly as it had begun
when the age-long accumulations of snow had all
melted the torrents ceased to pour down from the
mountains and immediately the courageous and in-
dustrious inhabitants of the netherlands began
to repair their broken dikes while in northern
italy and the plains of southeastern france every
effort was made to restore the terrible losses

  of course similar scenes had been enacted and
on even a more fearful scale in the plains of india
flooded by the melting of the enormous icy burden
that covered the himalayas the abode of snow
and all over the world wherever icy mountains
reared themselves above inhabited lands the same
story of destruction and death was told

  then after an interval came the yet more aw-
ful invasion of the sea

  but few details can be given from lack of records
the thames roared backward on its course and
london and all central england were inundated
a great bore of sea-water swept along the shores
of the english channel and bursting through the
skager-rak covered the lower end of sweden
and rushed up the gulf of finland buiying lenin-
grad and turning all western russia and the plains
of pomerania into a sea the netherlands disap-
peared the atlantic poured through the narrow
pass of the strait of gibraltar leaving only the
lion rock visible above the waves

  at length the ocean found its way into the desert
of sahara large areas of which had been reclaimed
and were inhabited by a considerable population of
prosperous farmers nowhere did the sudden com-
ing of the flood cause greater consternation than
here-strange as that statement may seem the
people had an undefined idea that they were pro-
tected by a sort of barrier from any possible inunda-
tion

  it had taken so many years and such endless
labor to introduce into the sahara sufficient water
to transform its potentially rich soil into arable
land that the thought of any sudden superabundance
of that element was far from the minds of the in-
dustrious agriculturists they had heard of the
inundations caused by the melting of the mountain
snows elsewhere but there were no snow-clad
mountains near them to be feared

  accordingly when a great wave of water came
rushing upon them surmounted where it swept
over yet unredeemed areas of the desert by im-
mense clouds of whirling dust that darkened the
air and recalled the old days of the simoom they
were taken completely by surprise but as the
water rose higher they tried valiantly to escape
they were progressive people and many of them
had aeros besides two or three lines of aero
expresses crossed their country all who could
do so immediately embarked in airships some flee-
ing toward europe and others hovering about


amazing stories

gazing in despair at the spreading waters beneath
them

  as the invasion of the sea grew more and more
serious this flight by airship became a common
spectacle over all the lower-lying parts of europe
and in the british isles but in the midst of it
the heavens opened their flood-gates as they had
done in the new world and then the aeros
flooded with rain and hurled about by contending
blasts of wind drooped fluttered and fell by
hundreds into the fast mounting waves the nebula
was upon them

  in the mean time those who had provided arks
of one kind or another tried desperately to get
them safely afloat all the vessels that succeeded
in leaving their wharves were packed with fugitives
boats of every sort were pressed into use and the
few that survived were soon floating over the
sites of the drowned homes of their occupants

  before it was too late yves de beauxchamps and
his friends launched their submarine and plunged
into the bosom of the flood

strange freaks of the nebula

e return to follow the fortunes of cosmo
versals ark

  after he had so providentially picked up
the crazed billionaire amos blank and his three
companions cosmo ordered capt arms to bear
away southeastward bidding farewell to the drown-
ed shores of america and sailing directly over the
lower part of manhattan and western long island
the navigation was not easy and if the ark had
not been a marvelously buoyant vessel it would not
long have survived at the beginning the heavy
and continuous rain kept down the waves and the
surface of the sea was comparatively smooth but
after a while a curious phenomenon began to be
noticed immense billows would suddenly appear
rushing upon the ark now from one direction and
now from another canting it over at a dangerous
angle and washing almost to the top of the huge
ellipsoid of the dome at such times it was difficult
for anybody to maintain a footing and there was
great terror among the passengers but cosmo
and stout capt arms remained at their post
relieving one another at frequent intervals and
never entrusting the sole charge of the vessel to
any of their lieutenants

  cosmo versal himself was puzzled to account for
the origin of the mighty billows for it seemed im-
possible that they could be raised by the wind not-
withstanding the fact that it blew at times with
hurricane force but at last the explanation came
of itself

  both cosmo and the captain happened to be on
the bridge together when they saw ahead something
that looked like an enormous column as black as ink
standing upright on the surface of the water a
glance showed that it was in swift motion and
more than that was approaching in a direct line
toward the ark in less than two minutes it was
upon them

  the instant that it met the ark a terrific roaring

deafened them and the rounded front of the dome
beneath their eyes disappeared under a deluge of
descending water so dense that the vision oould
not penetrate it in another half minute the great
vessel seemed to have been driven to the bottom
of the sea but for the peculiar construction of
the shelter of the bridge its occupants would have
been drowned at their posts as it was they were
soaked as if they had been plunged overboard im-
penetrable darkness surrounded them

  but the buoyant vessel shook itself rolled from
side to side and rose with a staggering motion un-
til it seemed to be poised on the summit of a watery
mountain immediately the complete darkness pass-
ed the awful downpour ceased although the rain
still fell in torrents and the ark began to glide
downward with sickening velocity as if it were
sliding down a liquid slope

  it was a considerable time before the two men
clinging to the supports of the bridge were able
to maintain their equilibrium sufficiently to render
it possible to utter a few connected words as soon
as he could speak with reasonable comfort cosmo
exclaimed

  now i see what it is that causes the billows
but it is a phenomenon that i should never have
anticipated it is all due to the nebula evidently
there are irregularities of some kind in its consti-
tution which cause the formation of almost solid
masses of water in the atmosphere-suspended
lakes as it were-which then plunge down in a
body as if a hundred thousand niagaras were pour-
ing together from the sky

  these sudden accessions of water raise stupend-
ous waves which sweep off in every direction and
that explains the billows that we have encountered

   well this nebular navigation beats all my experi-
ence said capt arms wiping the water out of
his eyes i was struck by a waterspout once in the
indian ocean and i thought that that capped the
climax but it was only a catspaw to this give me
a clear offing and i dont care how much wind
blows but blow me if i want to get under any more
lakes in the sky

  well have to take whatever comes returned
cosmo but i dont think there is much danger of
running directly into many of these downpours as
we did into this one now that we know what
they are we can perhaps detect them long enough
in advance to steer out of their way anyhow
weve got a good vessel under our feet anything
but an ark of ievium would have gone under for
good and if i had not covered the vessel with the
dome there would have been no chance for a soul in
her

  as a matter of fact the ark did not encounter
any more of the columns of descending water but
the frequent billows that were met showed that
they were careering over the face of the sea in
every direction-

  but there was another trouble of a different
nature the absence of sun and stars deprived
them of the ordinary means of discovering their
place they could only make a rough guees as to
the direction in which they were going the com-
passes gave them considerable assistance and they
the second deluge



had perfect chronometers but these latter could be
of no use without celestial observations of some
kind

  at length cosmo devised a means of obtaining
observations that were of sufficient value to partial-
ly serve their purpose he found that while the
disk of the sun was completely hidden in the watery
sky yet it was possible to determine its location by
means of the varying intensity of the light

  where the sun was a concentrated glow appeared
shading gradually off on all sides with infinite
pains cosmo assisted by the experience of the cap-
tain succeeded in determining the center of maxi-
mum illumination and assuming that to represent
the true place of the sun they got something in
the nature of observations for altitude and azimuth
and capt arms even drew on his chart sumner
lines to determine the position of the ark al-
though he smiled at the thought of their absurd
inaccuracy still it was the best they could do
and was better than nothing at all

  they kept a log going also although as the cap-
tain pointed out it was not of much use to know
how fast they were traveling since they could not
know the precise direction within a whole point of
the compass or perhaps several points

  besides he remarked what do we know of
the currents this is not the old atlantic if i
could feel the gulf stream id know whereabouts
i was but these currents come from all directions
and a man might as well try to navigate in a tub
of boiling water

  but we can at least keep working eastward
said cosmo my idea is first to make enough south-
ing to get into the latitude of the sahara desert
and then run directly east so as to cross africa
where there are no mountains and where we shall
be certain of having plenty of water under our
keel

  then having got somewhere in the neighborhood
of suez we can steer down into the region of the
indian ocean and circle round south of the hima-
layas i want to keep an eye on those mountains
and stay around the place where they disappear
because that will be the first part of the earth to
emerge from the flood and it is there that we shall
ultimately make land

  well were averaging eight knots said the cap-
tain  and at that rate we ought to be in the longi-
tude of the african coast in about twenty days
how high will the water stand then

  my gages show replied cosmo that the regu-
lar fall amounts to exactly the same thing a at
the beginning-two inches a minute of course
the spouts increase the amount locally but
i dont think that they add materially to the general
rise of the flood two inches per minute means
 feet in twenty days thatll be sufficient to
make safe navigation for us all the way across
northern africa well have to be careful in get-
ting out into the indian ocean area for there are
mountains on both sides that might give us trouble
but the higher ones will still be in sight and they
will serve to indicate the location of the lower
ranges already submerged but not covered deeply
enough to afford safe going over them

  all right said captain arms youre the com-
modore but if we dont hang our timbers on the
mountain of the moon or the alps or old ararat
im a porpoise why cant you keep circling round
at a safe distance in the middle of the atlantic
until all these reefs get a good depth of water on
em

  because cosmo replied even if we keep right
on now it will probably take two months allowing
for delays in getting around dangerous places to
come within sight of the himalayas and in two
months the flood will have risen nearly  feet
thus hiding many of the landmarks if we should
hold off here a couple of months before starting
eastward nothing but the one highest peak on the
globe would be left in sight by the time we arrived
there and that wouldnt be anything more than a
rock so that with the uncertainty of our naviga-
tion we might not be able to find it at all i must
know the spot where tibet sinks and then manage
to keep in its neighborhood

  that ended the argument

  give me a safe port with lights and bearings
and ill undertake to hit it anywhere in the two
hemispheres but blow me if i fancy steering for
the top of the world by dead reckoning or no
reckoning at all capt arms said

  at night of course they had not even the
slight advantage that their observations of the
probable place of the sun gave them when it was
above the horizon then they had to go solely by
the indications of the compass still they forged
steadily ahead and when they got into what they
deemed the proper latitude they ran for the site
of the drowned sahara

  after about a week the billowing motion caused
by the descent of the hakes in the sky ceased en-
tirely to their great delight but the lawless nebula
was now preparing another surprise for them

  on the ninth night after their departure from
their lodgment on the palisades cosmo versal was
sleeping in his bunk close by the bridge where he
could be called in an instant dreaming perhaps of
the glories of the new world that was to emerge out
of the deluge when he was abruptly awakened by
the voice of capt arms who appeared to be labor-
ing under uncontrollable excitement

  tumble up quickern you ever did in your life
he exclaimed the floods over

  cosmo sprang out of bed and pulled on his coat
in a second

  what do you mean he demanded

  look for yourself said the captain pointing
overhead

  cosmo versl glanced up and saw the sky blue
with stars the rain had entirely ceased the
surface of the sea was almost as smooth as glass
though rising and falling slowly with a long roll-
ing motion the ark rode steadily shivering like
an ocean liner under the impulse of its engines
and the sudden silence succeeding the ceaseless
roar of the downpour which had never been out of
their ears from the start of the voyage seemed
supernatural

  when did this happen he demanded

  it began not more than five minutes ago i was


amazing stories

just saying to myself that we ought to be some-
where near the center of the old atlantic as it used
to be and wondering whether we had got our course
laid right to go fairly between the canaries and the
cape de verde for i didnt want to be harpooned
by gogo or the peak of teneriffe when all of a sud-
den there came a lightening in the noreast and the
stars broke out there

  i was so set aback that i didnt do anything for
two or three minutes but stare at the stars then
the rain stopped and a curtain seemed to roll off
the sky and in a minute more it was clear down to
the horizon all round then i got my wits together
and ran to call you

  cosmo glanced around and above seeming to be
as much astonished as the captain had been he
rubbed his huge bald dome and looked all round
again before speaking at last he said

  its the nebula again there must be a hole in
it

  its whole bottoms knocked out i reckon said
the captain maybe its run out of water-sort o
squeezed itself dry

  cosmo shook his head

  we are not yet in the heart of it he said it
is evident to me now that what i took for the nu-
cleus was only a close-coiled spiral and weve run
out of that but the worst is yet to come when we
strike the center then well catch it and therell be
no more intermissions

  how long will that be asked captain arms
it may be a week and it may be a month
though i hardly think it will be so long as that the
earth is going about twelve miles a second-thats
more than a million miles a day-directly toward
the center of the nebula it has taken ten days to
go through the spiral that we have encountered
making that about ten million miles thick its not
likely that the gap between this spiral and the nuc-
leus of the nebula is more than thirty million miles
across at the most so you see well probably be in
the nucleus within a month and possibly much less
than a month

  captain arms took a chew of tobacco

  we can get our bearings now he remarked
look theres the moon just rising and on my
word she is going to occult aldebaran within an
hour ill get an observation for longitude and
another on polaris for latitude no running on
submerged mountains for us now

  the captain was as good as his word and when
his observations had been made and the calculations
completed he announced that the position of the
ark was latitude  degrees  minutes north
longitude  degrees  minutes west

  lucky for us he exclaimed that the sky
cleared if wed kept on as we were going wed
have struck the cape de verde and if that had
happened at night wed probably have left our
bones on a drowning volcano we ought to have
been ten or twelve degrees farther north to make
a safe passage over the-sahara whats the course
now are you still for running down the hima-
laya mountains

  ill decide later what to do said cosmo ver-
bl make your northing and then well cruise

around a little and see what is best to be done

  when day came on brilliant with sunshine and
the astonished passengers hurrying out of their
bunks crowded about the now opened gangways
and the port holes which cosmo had also ordered
to be opened and gazed with delight upon the
smooth blue sea the utmost enthusiasm took pos-
session of them

  the flood was over

  they were sure of it and they shook hands
with one another and congratulated themselves and
hurrahed and gave cheers for the ark and cheers
for cosmo versal then they began to think of
their drowned homes and of their lost friends and
sadness followed joy cosmo was mobbed by eager
inquirers wherever he made his appearance

  was it all over for good would the flood dry
up in a few days how long would it be before new
york would be free of water were they going
right back there did he think there was a chance
that many had escaped in boats and ships  couldnt
they pick up the survivors if they hurried back

  cosmo tried to check the enthusiasm

  its too early for rejoicing he assured them
its only a break in the nebula weve got a respite
for a short time but theres worse coming the
drowning of the world will proceed we are the
only survivors except perhaps some of those who
inhabited the highlands everything less than
 feet above the former level of the sea is now
under water when the flood begins again it will
keep on until it is six miles deep over the old sea
margins

  why not go back and try to rescue those who
you say may have found safety on the highlands
asked one

  i have chosen my company he said and i had
good reasons for the choice i made i have already
added to the number because simple humanity com-
pelled me but i can take no more the quantity of
provisions aboard the ark is not greater than will
be needed by ourselves if the rest of the world is
drowned it is not my fault i did my best to warn
them besides we could do nothing in the way of
rescue even if we should go back for that purpose
we could not approach the submerged plateaus
we would be aground before we got within sight of
them

  these words went far to change the current of
feeling among the passengers when they learned
that there would be danger for themselves in the
course that had been proposed their humanity prov-
ed to be less strong than their desire for self-
preservation nevertheless as we shall see the
ark ultimately went back to america though not
for any reason that had yet been suggested

  meanwhile the unexpected respite furnished by
the sudden cessation of the downpour from the
sky had other important results to which we now
turn

chapter xiv

escape of the president

when professor abiel pludder indited his
savage response to cosmo versals invita-
tion to become one of the regenerators of
the second deluge



mankind by embarking in the ark he was express-
ing his professional prejudice rather than his intel-
lectual conviction as cosmo had remarked plud-
der had a good brain and great scientific acuteness
and although he did not believe in the nebular
theory of a flood and was obstinately opposed to
everything that was not altogether regular and ac-
cording to recognized authority in science yet he
could not shut his eyes to the fact that something
was going wrong in the machinery of the heavens
but it annoyed him to find that his own explanations
were always falsified by the event while cosmo
versl seemed to have a superhuman fore-glimpse
of whatever happened

  his pride would not allow him to recede from
the position that he had taken but he could not
free himself from a certain anxiety about the
future after he had refused cosmo versis in-
vitation the course of events strengthened this
anxiety he found that the official meteorologists
were totally unable to account for the marvelous
vagaries of the weather

  finally when the news came of tremendous
floods in the north and of the overflowing of hud-
son bay he secretly determined to make some pre-
parations of his own he still rejected the idea of
a watery nebula but he began to think it possible
that all the lowlands of the earth might be over-
flowed by the sea and by the melting of mountain
snows and glaciers together with deluging rain-
fall after what had passed he could not think of
making any public confession of his change of
heart but his sense of humanity compelled him to
give confidential warning to his friends that it
would be well to be prepared to get on high ground
at a moments notice

  he was on the point of issuing but without his
signature an official statement cautioning the pub-
lic against unprecedented inundations when the
first tidal wave arrived on the atlantic coast and
rendered any utterance of that kind unnecessary
peoples eyes were opened and now they would
look out for themselves

ludders private preparations amounted to no
more than the securing of a large express aero in
which if the necessity for suddenly leaving wash-
ington should arise he intended to take flight to-
gether with president samson who was his per-
sonal friend and a number of other close friends
with their families he did not think that it would
be necessary in any event to go farther than the
mountains of virginia

  the rising of the sea mounting higher at each
return at length convinced him that the time had
come to get away hundreds of air craft had al-
ready departed westward not only from washing-
ton but from new york philadelphia baltimore
boston and other seaboard cities before professor
pludder assembled his friends by telephone on the
capitol grounds where his aero was waiting

  the lower streets of the city were under water
from the overflow of the potomac which was back-
ed up by the influx of the atlantic into chesapeake
bay and the most distressing scenes were enacted
there people fleeing in the utmost disorder toward
higher ground carrying their children and some

of their household goods and uttering doleful cries
many thinking it the best way to escape embarked
in frail boats on the river which was running up-
stream with frightful velocity and rising percep-
tibly higher every second most of these boats were
immediately overturned or swamped

  if the start had been delayed but a little longer
the aero would have been mobbed by the excited
people who uttered yells of disappointment and
rage when they saw it rise from its tower and sail
over the city it was the last air-ship that left
washington and it carried the last persons who
escaped from the national capital before the down-
pour from the atmosphere began which put an end
to all possibility of getting away

  there were on board in addition to a crew of
three twenty-two persons these included presi-
dent samson with his wife and three children
seven other men with their families making to-
gether sixteen persons and professor pludder
who had no family

  more because they wished to escape from the
painful scenes beneath them than because they
deemed that there was any occasion for particular
haste they started off at high speed and it was
probably lucky for them that this speed was main-
tained after they had left washington out of sight
they rapidly approached the blue ridge in the
neighborhood of luray and pludder was about to
order a landing there as night was approaching
when with great suddenness the sky filled with
dense clouds and a tremendous downpour began
this was the same phenomenon which has already
been described as following closely the attack at
new york on cosmo versals ark

  the aero luckily was one of the best type and
well covered so that they were protected from the
terrible force of the rain but in the tumult there
could be no more thought of descending it would
have been impossible to make a landing in the midst
of the storm and the pouring water which rushed
in torrents down the mountainside professor plud-
der was a brave man and full of resources when
driven into a corner being familiar with the con-
struction and management of aeros for he had been
educated as an engineer he now took charge of the
airship

  within twenty minutes after the sky had opened
its batteries-for the rain had almost the force of
plunging shot-a mighty wind arose and the aero
pitching tossing and dipping like a mad thing was
driven with frightful speed eastward this wild
rush continued for more than an hour by this
time it was full night and the pouring rain around
them was as impenetrable to the sight as a black
wall

  they had their electric lamps inside and their
search-lights but it was impossible to tell where
they were pludder turned the search-light down-
ward but he could not make out the features of the
ground beneath them it is likely that they were
driven at least as far as chesapeake bay and they
may have passed directly over washington

  at last however the wind slewed round and be-
gan to blow with undiminished violence from the
northeast plunging and swerving and sometimes


amazing stories

threatened with a complete somersault the aero
hurried away in its crazy flight while its un-
fortunate inmates clung to one another and held on
by any object within reach in the endeavor to keep
from being dashed against the metallic walls

  the crew of the aero were picked men but no
experience could have prepared them for the work
which they now had to do without the ready
brain of professor pi udder to direct their efforts
and without his personal exertions their aerial
ship would have been wrecked within a quarter of
an hour after the storm struck it he seemed trans-
formed into another person hatless and coatless
and streaming with water he worked like a demon
he was ready at each emergency with some device
which under his direction had the effect of magic

  a hundred times the aero plunged for the ground
but was saved and turned upward again just as it
seemed on the point of striking up and down
right and left it ran and pitched and whirled like
a cork in a whirlpool sometimes it actually skim-
med the ground plowing its way through a torrent
of rushing water and yet it rose again and was
saved from destruction

  this terrible contest lasted another hour after
the turning of the wind and then the latter died
out relieved from its pressure the aero ran on
with comparative ease professor pludder suspect-
ing that they might now be getting into a moun-
tainous district made every effort to keep the craft
at a high elevation and this notwithstanding the
depressing force of the rain they succeeded in do-
ing after the dying out of the wind they kept on
by the aid of their propellers in the same direction
in which it had been driving them because in the
circumstances one way was as good as another

  the terrible discomfort of the president and his
companions in the cabin of the aero was greatly
relieved by the cessation of the wind but still they
were in a most unfortunate state the rain driven
by the fierce blasts had penetrated through every
crevice and they were drenched to the skin no
one tried to speak for it would have been almost
impossible to make oneself heard amid the uproar
they simply looked at one another in dismay and
prayed for safety

  professor pludder not now compelled to spend
every moment in the management of the craft
entered the cabin occasionally pressed the hand of
the president smiled encouragingly on the women
and children and did all he could in pantomime to
restore some degree of confidence inside the
lights were aglow but outside it was as dark as
pitch except where the broad finger of the search-
light plunging into the mass of tumbling water
glittered and flashed

  the awful night seemed endless but at last a pale
illumination appeared in the air and they knew that
day had come the spectacle of the sky de-
luge was now so terrible that it struck cold even to
their already benumbed hearts the atmosphere
seemed to have been turned into a mighty cataract
thundering down upon the whole face of the earth
now that they could see as well as hear the miracle
of the preservation of the aero appeared incredible

  as the light slowly brightened professor plud-

der constantly on the outlook caught a glimpse of
a dark misty object ahead it loomed up so sud-
denly and was already so close that before he could
sufficiently alter the course of the aero it struck
with such violence as to crush the forward end of
the craft and break one of the planes everybody
was pitched headforemost those inside falling on the
flooring while pludder and the three men of the
crew were thrown out upon a mass of rocks ad
were more or less seriously injured but none was 
killed or totally disabled

  pludder sprang to hjs feet and slipping and
plunging amid the downpour managed to get back
to the wreck and aid the president and the others
to get upon their feet

  were lodged on a mountain he yelled stay
inside under the shelter of the roof

  the three men who together with the professor
had been precipitated out among the rocks also
scrambled in and there they stood or sat the most
disconsolate and despairing group of human beings
that ever the eye of an overseeing providence looked
down upon

  the president presented the most pitiable sight
of all like the rest his garments were sopping
his eyes were bloodshot his face was ghastly and
his tall silk hat which he had jammed down upon
his brow had been softened by the water and crush-
ed by repeated blows into the form of a closed ac-
cordion- of the women and children it is needless
to speak no description could convey an idea of
their condition

  in these circumstances the real strength of pro-
fessor abiel pludders mind was splendidly display-
ed he did not lose his head and he comprehended
the situation and what it was necessary to do in a
flash he got out some provisions and distributed
them to the company in some cases actually forcing
them to eat with his own hands he prepared cof-
fee with the apparatus always carried by express
aeros and made them drink it

  when all had thus been refreshed he approached
president samson and shouted in his ear

  we shall have to stay here until the downpour
ceases to guard against the effects of a tempebt
if one should arise we must secure the aero in its
place for that i need the aid of every man in the
party we have fortunately struck in a spot on
the mountain where we are out of the way of the
torrents of water that are pouring down through
the ravines on either side we can make our
lodgment secure but we must go to work imme-
diately

  stimulated by his example the president and the
others set to work and with great difficulty for
they had to guard their eyes and nostrils from the
driving rain which sometimes in spite of their
precautions nearly smothered them they succeeded
in fastening the aero to the rocks by means of
metallic cables taken from its stores when this
work was finished they returned under the shelter
of the cabin roof and lay down exhausted so worn
out were they that all of them quickly fell into a
troubled sleep

  it would be needless to relate in detail the suf-
ferings mental and physical that they underwent
the second deluge



daring the next ten days while they were hanging
there on the mountain the seaboard cities of the
world were drowned and cosmo versls ark de-
parted on the remarkable voyage that has been des-
cribed in a former chapter they had plenty of
provisions for the aero had been well stored but
partly through precaution and partly because of
lack of appetite they ate sparingly the electric
generators of the aero had not been injured in the
wreck of the craft and they were able to supply
themselves with sufficient heat and with light inside
the cabin at night

  once they had a strange visitor-a half-drowned
bear which had struggled up the mountain from
its den somewhere below-but that was the only
living creature beside themselves that they saw
after gazing wistfully at the aero from the top of a
rock the poor bear stumbled into one of the torrents
that poured furiously down on each side and was
swept from their sight

  fortunately the wind that they had anticipated
did not come but frequently they saw or heard the
roaring downpours of solid watery columns like
those that had so much astonished cosmo versl
and captain arms in the midst of the atlantic but
none came very near them

  professor pludder ventured out from time to
time clambering a little way up and down the pro-
jecting ridge of the mountain on which they were
lodged and at length was able to assure his com-
panions that they were on the northwestern face of
mount mitchell the highest peak of the appalach-
ian range with the aid of his pocket aneroid mak-
ing allowance for the effect of the lifting of the
whole atmosphere by the flood and summoning his
knowledge of the locality-for he had explored in
former years all the mountains in this region-he
arrived at the conclusion that their place of refuge
was elevated about four thousand feet above the
former level of the sea

  at first their range of vision did not allow them
to see the condition of the valleys below them but
as the water rose higher it gradually came into
view it crept steadily up the slopes beneath which
had already been stripped of their covering of trees
and vegetation by the force of the descending tor-
rents until on the tenth day it had arrived almost
within reach since as has just been said they
were four thousand feet above the former level of
the sea it will be observed that the water must
have risen much more rapidly than the measure-
ments of cosmo veral indicated its average rate
of rise had been three instead of two inches per
minute and the world was buried deeper than
cosmo thought the cause of his error will be ex-
plained later

  the consternation of the little party when they
thus beheld the rapid drowning of the world below
them and saw no possibility of escape for them-
selves if the water continued to rise as it evidently
would do cannot be depicted some of them were
driven insane and were with difficulty prevented
by those who retained their senses from throwing
themselves into the flood

  pludder was the only one who maintained a
command over hia nerves although he now at last

believed in the nebula he recognized that there
was no other possible explanation of the flood than
that which cosmo versl had offered long before it
began in his secret heart he had no expectation of
ultimate escape yet he was strong enough to con-
tinue to encourage his companions with hopes which
he could not himself entertain

  when after nightfall on the tenth day the water
began to lap the lower parts of the aero he was on
the point of persuading the party to clamber up the
rocks in search of some shelter above but as he
stepped out of the door   he cabin to reconnoiter
the way with the aid of search-light which he
had turned up along the rfge he was astonished to
find the rain rapidly diminishing in force and a
few minutes later it ceased entirely and the stars
shone out

  the sudden cessation of the roar upon the roof
brought everybody to his feet and before profes-
sor pludder could communicate the good news all
were out under the sky rejoicing and offering
thanks for their delivery the women were es-
pecially affected they wept in one anothers arm
or convulsively clasped their children to their
breasts

  at length the president found his voice

  what haa happened he asked

  professor pludder with the new light that had
come to him was as ready with an explanation as
cosmo varsal himself had been under similar cir-
cumstances

  we must have run out of the nebula

  the nebula i returned mr samson in surprise
has there been a nebula then

  without question was the professors answer
nothing but an encounter with a watery nebula
could have had such a result

  but you always said- began the president

  yes pludder broke in but one may be in er-
ror sometimes

  then cosmo versal-

  let us not discuss cosmo versl exclaimed
professor pludder with a return of his old dic-
tatorial manner

chapter xv

professor pludders device

day dawned brilliantly on mount mitchell
and revealed to the astonished eyes of the
watchers an endless expanse of water
gleaming and sparkling in the morning sunlight
it was a spectacle at once beautiful and fearful and
calculated to make their hearts sink with pity no less
than with terror but for a time they were dis-
tracted from the awful thoughts which such a sight
must inspire by anxiety concerning themselves
they could not drive away the fear that at any
moment the awful clouds might return and the
terrible downpour be resumed

  but professor pludder whose comprehension of
the cause of the deluge was growing clearer the
more he thought about it did not share the anxiety
of the president and the others

  the brightness of the sky he said shows that
there is no considerable quantity of condensing


amazing stories

vapor left in the atmosphere if the earth has run
out of the nebula that is likely to be the end of the
thing if there is more of the nebulous matter in
surrounding space we may miss it entirely or if
not a long time would elapse before we came upon
it

  the gaps that exist in nebulse are millions of
miles across and the earth would require days and
weeks to go such distances granting that it were
traveling in the proper direction i think it alto-
gether probable that this nebula which must be a
small one as such things go consists of a single
mass and that having traversed it we are done
with it we are out of our troubles

  well hardly said the president here we
are prisoners on a mountain with no way of get-
ting down the whole land beneath being turned in-
to a sea we cant stay here indefinitely for how
long a time are we provisioned

  we have compressed food enough to last this
party a month replied professor pludder that is
to say if we are sparing of it for water we can-
not lack since this that surrounds us is not salt and
if it were we could manage to distil it but of
course when i said we were out of our troubles i
meant only that there was no longer any danger of
being swallowed up by the flood it is true that we
cannot think of remaining here we must get off
but how where can we go

  professor pludder thought a long time before he
answered this question finally he said measuring
his words

  the water is four thousand feet above the
former level of the sea there is no land sufficiently
lofty to rise above it this side of the colorado plat-
eau

  and how far is that

  not less than eleven hundred miles in an air
line

  the president shuddered

  then all this vast country of ours from here to
the feet of the rocky mountains is now under water
thousands of feet deep

  there can be no doubt of it the atlantic
coast states the southern states the mississippi
valley the region of the great lakes and canada
are now a part of the atlantic ocean

  and all the great cities - gone merciful
father what a thought

  the president mused for a time and gradually a
frown came upon his brow he glanced at profes-
sor pludder with a singular look then his cheek
reddened and an angry expression came into his
eyes suddenly he turned to the professor and said
sternly

  you said you did not wish to discuss cosmo
varsal i should not think you would who pre-
dicted this deluge did you

  i- began professor pludder taken aback by
the presidents manner

  oh yes interrupted the president i know
what you would say you didnt predict it because
you didnt see it coming but why didnt
you see it what have we got observatories
and scientific societies for if they cant see or com-
prehend anything didnt cosmo versl warn you

didnt he tell you where to look and what to look
for didnt he show you his proofs

  we thought they were fallacious stammered
professor pludder

  you thought they were fallacious-well were
they fallacious does this spectacle of a nation
drowned look fallacious to you why didnt you
study the matter until you understood it why
did you issue officially and with my ignorant sanc-
tion-may god forgive me for my blindness-
statement after statement assuring the people that
there was no danger-statements that were even
abusive towards him who alone should have been
heard

  and yet as now appears you knew nothing
about it millions upon millions have perished
through your obstinate opposition to the truth
they might have saved themselves if they had
been permitted to listen to the reiterated warnings
of cosmo versal

  oh if i had only listened to him and issued a
proclamation as he urged me to do but i fol-
lowed your advice-you in whose learning and pre-
tended science i put blind faith abiel pludder i
would not have upon my soul the weight that now
rests on yours for all the wealth that the lost world
carried down into its watery grave

  as the president ceased speaking he turned away
and sank upon a rock pressing his hands upon his
throat to suppress the sobs that broke forth despite
his efforts his form shook like an aspen

  the others crowded around excitedly some of
the women in hysterics and the men not knowing
what to do or say professor pludder completely
overwhelmed by the suddenness and violence of the
attack went off by himself and sat down with hi
head in his hands after a while he arose and ap-
proached the president who had not moved from
his place on the rock

  george he said-they had known each other
from boyhood-i have made a terrible mistake
and yet i was not alone in it the majority of my
colleagues were of my opinion as were all the
learned societies of europe no such thing as a
watery nebula has ever been known to science it
was inconceivable

  some of your colleagues did not think so said
the president looking up

  but they were not really convinced and they
were aware that they were flying in the face of all
known laws

  i am afraid said the president dryly that
science does not know all the laws of the universe
yet

  i repeat resumed professor pludder that i
made a fearful mistake i have recognized the truth
too late i accept the awful burden of blame that
rests upon me and i now wish to do everything in
my power to retrieve the consequences of my error
the president arose and grasped the professors
hand

  forgive me abiel he said with emotion if
i have spoken too much in the manner of a judge
pronouncing sentence i was overwhelmed by the
thought of the inconceivable calamity that has come
upon us i believe that you acted conscientiously
the second deluge



and according to your best lights and it is not for
any mortal to judge you for an error thus commit-
ted let us think only of what we must do now

  to that thought responded professor pludder
returning the pressure of the presidents hand i
shall devote all my energy if i can save only this
little party i shall have done something in the way
of atonement

  it was a deep humiliation for a man of profes-
sor pludders proud and uncompromising nature to
confess that he had committed an error more fear-
ful in its consequences than had ever been laid at
the door of a human being but cosmo versal had
rightly judged him when he assured joseph smith
that pludder was morally sound and in a scientific
sense had the root of the matter in him when his
mental vision was clear and unclouded by prejud-
ice no one was more capable of high achievements

  he quickly proved his capacity now as he had al-
ready proved it during the preceding adventures of
the presidents party it was perfectly plain to him
that their only chance was in getting to colorado
at the earliest possible moment the eastern part
of the continent was hopelessly buried and even on
the high plains of the middle west the fury of the
downpour might have spread universal disaster and
destroyed nearly all the vegetation but in any
event it was there alone that the means of prolong-
ing life could be sought

  with the problem squarely before his mind he
was not long in finding a solution his first step
was to make a thorough examination of the aero
with the hope that the damage that it had suffered
might be reparable he had all the tools that would
be needed as it was the custom for express aeros
to carry a complete equipment for repairs but un-
fortunately one of the planes of the aero was
wrecked beyond the possibility of repair he knew
upon what delicate adjustments the safety of the
modern airship depended and he did not dare un-
dertake a voyage with a lame craft

  then the idea occurred to him of trying to escape
by water the aero was a machine of the very lat-
est type and made of levium consequently it would
float better than wood

  if the opposition of ship-builders incited and
backed by selfish interests had not prevented the
employment of levium in marine construction mil-
lions of lives might now have been saved but as
we have before said only a few experimental boats
of levium had been made

  moreover like all aeros intended for long trips
this one had what was called a boat-bottom in-
tended to enable it to remain afloat with its burden
in case of an accidental fall into a large body of
water pludder saw that this fact would enable him
to turn the wreck into a raft

  it would only be necessary to reshape the craft a
little and this was the easier because the aero was
put together in such a manner with screw-bolts and
nuts that it could be articulated or disarticulated as
readily as a watch he had entire confidence in his
engineering skill and in the ability of the three
experienced men of the crew to aid him he decided
to employ the planes for outriders which would
serve to increase the buoyancy and stability

  as soon as he had completed his plan in his mind
he explained his intentions to the president the
latter and the other members of the party were at
first as much startled as surprised by the idea of
embarking on a voyage of eleven hundred miles in
so questionable a craft but professor pludder as-
sured them that everything would go well

  but how about the propulsion asked mr sam-
son you cant depend on the wind and weve got
no sails

  i have thought that all out said pludder i
shall use the engine and rearrange one of the aerial
screws so that it will serve for a propeller i do not
expect to get up any great speed but if we can
make only as much as two miles an hour we shall
arrive on the borders of the colorado upland five
thousand feet above sea within about twenty-three
days we may be able to do better than that

  nobody felt much confidence in this scheme ex-
cept its inventor but it appeared to be the only
thing that could be done and so they all fell to
work each aiding as best he could and after four
days of hard work the remarkable craft was ready
for its adventurous voyage

  professor pludder had succeeded even better than
he anticipated in transforming one of the aerial
screws into a propeller its original situation was
such that it naturally as it were fell into the prop-
er place when the hull was partly submerged
and the blades being made of concentric rows of
small plates there was no difficulty in reducing
them to a manageable size the position of the en-
gine did not need to be changed at all

  the outriders made up of the discarded
planes promised to serve their purpose well and the
cabin remained for a comfortable deck-house a
rudder had been contrived by an alteration of the
one which had served for guiding the aero in its
flights

  the water was close to their feet and there was
no great difficulty in pushing the affair off the rocks
and getting it afloat the women and children were
first put aboard and then the men scrambled
in and pludder set the motors going the im-
provised propeller churned and spluttered but it
did its work after a fashion and under a blue sky
in dazzling sunshine with a soft southerly breeze
fanning the strange sea that spread around them
they soon saw the bared rocks and deeply scored
flanks of mount mitchell receding behind them

  they were delighted to find that they were mak-
ing at the very start no less than three miles an
hour pludder clapped his hands and exclaimed

  this is capital in but little over two weeks we
shall be safe on the great plains i have good hope
that many have survived there and that we shall
find a plenty of everything needed with the in-
struments that were aboard the aero i can make
observations to determine our position and i shall
steer for the pikes peak region

  when the party had become accustomed to their
situation and had gained confidence in their craft
by observing how buoyantly it bore them they be-
came almost cheerful in their demeanor the
children gradually lost all fear and with the
thoughtless joy of childhood in the pleasures and

the second deluge

by garrett p serviss
continued

wonders of the present moment
amused themselves in the cabin and
about the deck which had been sur-
rounded with guard lines made of
wire cable

  the water was almost waveless and
if no storm should arise there ap-
peared to be no reason for anxiety
concerning the outcome of their ad-
venture but as they drove slowly
on over the submerged range of the
great smokies and across the valleys
of eastern tennessee and then over
the cumberland range and so out
above the lowlands they could not
keep their thoughts from turning to
what lay beneath that fearful ocean
and occasionally something floated to
the surface that wrenched their heart-
strings and caused them to avert
their faces

  professor pludder kept them in-
formed of their location now they
were over central tennessee now
nashville lay more than three thou-
sand feet beneath their keel now
they were crossing the valley of the
tennessee river now the great miss-
issippi was under them hidden deep
beneath the universal flood now they
were over the highlands of southern
missouri and now over those of
kansas

  george said professor pludder
me day addressing the president
with more emotion than was often to
oe detected in his voice would you
ike to know what is beneath us now
what is it abiel

  our boyhood home-wichita

  the president bowed his head upon
lis hands and groaned

  yes continued professor pludder
nusingly there it lies three thou-
sand feet deep there is the arkansas
ilong whose banks we used to play
vith its golden waters now mingling
feebly with the mighty flood that
covers them there is the school
louse and the sandy road where we
ran races barefoot in the hot summer
iust there is your fathers house
ind mine and the homes of all our
arly friends-and where are they
would to god that i had not been so
dlind

 but there was another not so
dlind said the president with some-
thing of the condemnatory manner
f his former speech

 i know it-i know it too well
low returned the professor but
io not condemn me george for what
 did not foresee and could not help
i am sorry said the president
jadjy that you have awakened those
jfd jnemorka but i do not condemn

you though i condemn your science-
or your lack of science but we can
do nothing let us speak of it no
more

  the weather was wonderful con-
sidering what had so recently occur-
red no clouds formed in the sky
there was only a gentle breeze stir-
ring at night the heavens glittered
with starry gems and by day the sun
shone so hotly that awnings were
spread over those whose duties re-
quired them to be employed outside
the shelter of the cabin the impro-
vised propeller and rudder worked to
admiration and some days they made
as much as eighty miles in the twenty-
four hours

  at length on the fourteenth day of
their strange voyage they caught
sight of a curiously shaped pike that
projected above the horizon far to the
west at the same time they saw not
far away toward the north and to-
ward the south a low line like a sea-
beach

  we are getting into shallow water
now said professor pludder i
have been following the course of the
arkansas in order to be sure of a suf-
ficient depth but now we must be very
careful we are close to the site of las
animas which is surrounded with
land rising four thousand feet above
sea level if we should get aground
there would be no hope for us that
peak in the distance is pikes peak

  and what is that long line of
beach that stretches on the north and
south asked the president

  it is the topographic line of four
thousand feet replied the professor

  and we shall encounter it ahead

  yes it makes a curve about las
animas and then the land lies at an
average elevation of four thousand
feet until it takes another rise beyond
pueblo

  but we cannot sail across this half-
submerged area said the president

  there are depressions professor
pludder responded and i hope to be
able to follow their traces until we
reach land that still lies well above
the water

  near nightfall they got so close to
the beach that they could hear the
surf not a thundering sound but a
soft rippling wash of the slight
waves the water about them was
ruddy with thick sediment profes-
sor pludder did not dare to venture
farther in the coming darkness and
he dropped overboard two of the aeros
grapples which he had heavily
weighted and attached to wire cables

spoken so accurate was his topo-
graphic knowledge and so great his
skill that late in the afternoon they
saw a tall chimney projecting above
the water a little ahead

  theres all that remains of
pueblo said professor pludder

  they anchored again that night and
the next day cautiously approaching
a bluff that arose precipitously from
the water their hearts were glad-
dened by the sight of three men
standing on a bluff excitedly beckon-
ing to them and shouting at the top
of their voices

to be concluded next month

other word went into the hall but
when his face was no longer visible
to trant the hanging pouches under
his eyes grew leaden gray his fat
lips fell apart loosely his step shuf-
fled  his mask had fallen

besides we need all the men we
have i think said trant turning

back to the prisoners to get these
to a safe place miss rowan he
turned then and put out his hand to
steady the terrified and weeping girl
i warned you that you had probably
better not come here to-night but
since you have come and have had
pain because of your stepfathers
wrong doings i am glad to be able to
give you the additional assurance be-
yond the fact which you have heard
that your fianc was not murdered
but merely put away on board the
elizabethan age that he is safe and
sound except for a few bruises and
moreover we expect him here any
moment now the police are bring-
ing him down from boston on the
train which arrives at ten

  he went to the window and watched
an instant as dickey and rentland
having telephoned for a patrol were
waiting with their prisoners before
the patrol wagon appeared he saw the
bobbing lanterns of a lurching cab
that turned a corner a block away as
it stopped at the entrance a police
officer in plain clothes leaped out and
helped after him a young man wrap-
ped in an overcoat with one arm in a
sling pale and with bandaged head
the girl uttered a cry and sped
through the doorway for a moment
the psychologist stood watching the
greeting of the lovers he turned
back then to the sullen prisoners

 but its some advance isnt it
rentland he asked not to have to
try such poor devils alone but at
last to capture the man who makes
the millions and pays them the
pennies-the man higher up

   ascension

       by leland s copeland

  age by age the sun is rising
  toward the apex of its way

  seeking heights where vega sparkles
  many trillion miles away

  so the soul of man is climbing

  wistful ever mortals wind
  farther from the brute and caveman
  dawn and morning of the mind

  into dust fall kings and idols
  superstition ancient gear

  for the strength of thought is stronger
  than the curb of hope or fear

  man is breaking vain traditions

  old injustice legal wrong

  giving outworn good for better

  while he thinks and toils along
  quelling plagues controlling nature-
  losing zest for martial fame-
  winning on this little planet
  glory for the human name

  smiling upward sweeping onward
  through the night and through the day
  mounts the soul of man still higher
  toward the apex of its way

the lord of the
winds

by augusto bissiri
continued

 bellowing there groaned

a noise as of a sea in tempest torn

 by warring winds the stormy
   blast of hell

  with restless fury drove the spirits
     on

whirld round and dashd amain

  the gruesome fascination of that
maddening scene was abruptly inter-
rupted the dune of sand was now
almost as low as my head

  i pressed myself more tightly to the
ground and laid my head sideways on
my left ear i could not now see the
edge of the dune but i was feeling
the little grains of sand puffed away
every flying second

  how to describe the agony of those
moments that seemed an eternity
oh anything except that uncertainty
as to what the hurricane would do
with me before death came sud-
denly a thought flashed through my
mind there was one way out of this
mental torture-my gun i felt the
joy of meeting a milder death and
of cheating my cruel executioner i
composed myself to die as a man and
bringing the gun to my temple i
raised my head a little

the wind ceases-one only sur-
vivor tells this story

when i regained consciousness
the first thing i felt was a
severe pain in my head i recollected
everything in a flash but i could not
remember having fired any shot and
could find no trace of blood a piece
of timber lying on my legs gave me
the answer

  and to my astonishment and exul-
tation the wind was no more the
air was still and the moon shone even
more brightly

   looked at the top of the tower
the green and blue flashings had
disappeared and the large glass bulb
itself was no longer there i was
saved

  it was not difficult for me to
imagine what had put the tower and
thus the whole system out of action
some flying piece of wreckage must
have hit the top smashing the bulb
where the roentgen rays were formed

  but what had put on the current
and started that havoc

  i	found the solution when i entered
the stone house lying dead on the
bench where the batteries were his
body resting on the largest switch
his right hand still holding a pisto

  evidently the miner determined to

to hide in the stone house he had
entered through the open window
but having to jump over the long

had pressed the largest switch send-

the educated
harpoon

by chas s wolfe

continued

you found it in here some place did
you he barked

  no i could positively feel franks
relief but i know what it was done
with

  damn exploded the chief so
do  it was a knife but where-

  oh no it wasnt smiled fenner
it was a harpoon

  the chiefs lower jaw sagged and
frank darted to the window then
he turned back listlessly to joe come
again fenner he said it cant be
done

  not from those buildings below
very handy admitted joe but this
harpoon came from the yeakle

  the chief laughed shortly thats
a poor joke joe he snapped the
yeakle is a good quarter of a mile
away

fenner laughed yes but this
was an educated harpoon he said

  the detective frank gave a sudden
start i get you fenner he yelled
and he was in motion while he spoke
and ill get him and bring him here

hey yelled the chief what

  but a slamming door was the only
answer frank was gone

  davidson turned to fenner what
kind of a game is this he demanded
youre a pair of crazy asses you and
frank now tell me what youre up
to

  bright boy frank observed fen-
ner it didnt take him long to
tumble once he got the tip now sit
down and wait until he gets back

  for a half hour we waited in silence
fenner smoked nonchalantly and re-
fused to talk the chief fumed and
paced the room a waste of time
he muttered again and again the
minutes dragged by

  and then the door opened and
frank pushed into our presence a
swarthy little man with waxed mus-
taches and a decidedly foreign air
he was handcuffed two uniformed
policemen came behind bearing a long

 wooden box which they placed on the
 desk heres the bird chief
 chortled frank fenner youre a
 dandy

   the chief and  stared sure you
 got the right man he demanded
 then to the prisoner what have you
 got to say remember it may be
 used against you

   there is nothing to say said the
 prisoner in perfect english except

 that  killed corey-

   you confess yelled the chief

  the man shrugged hopelessly
 confess he echoed what else is
 there to do i suppose you want to
 know why well because corey
 ruined me financially lie stole my
 purse i stole his life but id like to
 know how you picked up the trail
 fenner stepped over to the un-
 fortunate man i found it he said
 simply why didnt you keep that
 clothes line of yours indoors

   the man started paled then cried
 in anguish my god i never thought
 of that i could have couldnt i
 you could agreed fenner grimly
 and if you had you never would have
 been caught send him over chief
 and ill tell you how the trick was
 done

   the man departed in charge of the
 two officers and fenner tore the lid
 off the wooden box which the officers
 had brought he turned to me and
 here bill he said mockingly is
 your educated harpoon

   and he placed before my aston-
 ished eyes an educated harpoon in
 very truth it was a small airplane
 wirelessly controlled and its nose was
 a long bayonet-like knife

   then the clothes line-

   was his aerial cut in joe and
 for the distance over which he wanted
 to work he might just as well have
 kept it inside just look this thing
 over carefully old man its a shame
 that fellow stooped to murder he
 has ideas worked out here that would
 have retrieved his fallen fortunes
 notice that the airplane attachment
 is really two complete planes ive
 been wondering ever since i realized
 how the job was done how under the
 sun after the knife was buried in
 coreys back it was gotten out again
 now i see when it came through
 that window the wings were right in
 back of the knife and the propellers

 in back of the wings with the rudder
 at the rear now notice the hinging
 arrangement which folded the wings
 into a rudder and opened the rudder
 out into a set of wings the whole
 machine was reversed even an auxi-
 liary propeller has been provided
 and the lag of the knife in the wound
 held the whole thing like a brake
 just long enough for the propeller to
 get up speed before it gave and re-
 leased the machine at that the fel-
 low must have had an anxious minute
 until he got the contrivance out
 through the window again only the
 fact that it is a large room allowed
 him to get the machine high enough
 to clear that window sill on its way
 out the selective control offers noth-
 ing new the control points are con-
 stantly traversed by a revolving
 clock-work driven switch and these
 miniature vari-colored lights were the
 tell-tales that told the distant pilot on
 what contact point the blade rested
 at any given minute for instance
 when the light showed red the rud-
 der could be swung to the right when
 on green to the left he followed its
 course through powerful night glasses
 take a look at the coherer you never
 saw the like before ill bet its a
 peach and this relays weight or
 rather lack of it would amaze you
 but the masterpiece of the whole
 thing is the power plant he must
 have worked for months on this model
 gasoline engine i can imagine that
 for its weight it produces an awful
 power and it is absolutely silenced

   there are at least a dozen new
 ideas involved here and new applica-
 tions of hundreds of old ones under
 the spur of a great emotion-re-
 venge-this man has produced a
 thing of terrible possibilities you
 have seen what happened to corey

   the chief and i were gazing in
 awe at the little plane i appreciated
 the disposition of wing surface which
 cut down the span sufficiently to al-
 low it to pass through a window three
 feet wide and i realized the patient
 paring away of a fraction of an ounce
 there that brought the total weight of
 the machine low enough to allow of
 the small supporting surface there
 was not an unessential piece of ma-
 terial to be found on the plane the
 only thing not needed in the operation
 of the thing was the knife and even

that had been ground down until it
was little more than a very thick
needle along its length with a large
cutting surface at its point

  the chief finally broke the silence
i think he said that the educated
harpoon is too dangerous a contri-
vance to survive science many need
a lot of these do-funny things on it
but it will have to worry along with-
out them the details will not be made
public and just as soon as that man is
convicted im going to personally
destroy it

 fenner nodded thoughtfully yes
he agreed its a shame to do it but
god help us all if its constructional
features become known

  he lifted it tenderly and placed it
in the wooden box with the lid in
his hand he paused looking down
his eyes shone with the love of an
enthusiast for the delicate wicked
creation good-bye educated har-
poon he breathed
