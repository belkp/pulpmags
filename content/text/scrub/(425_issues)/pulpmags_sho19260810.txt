 time the healer

it furnished an eloquent testimonial
i to the healing qualities of time when in
celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of the
battle of the little big horn aged white
survivors of the regiment once commanded
by general george
a custer and
equally ancient in-
dians who had par-
ticipated in the
campaigns leading
up to and follow-
ing that massacre
met on the battle-
field and solemny
shook hands in
token o f lasting
peace between the
white man and the
red as all will re-
member the battle
of the little big
horn was the be-
ginning of the end
as a dominant race
for the indian it
was to be the bat-
tle whereby the
reds would turn
back forever the
westward pushing
whites and it was
the greatest i n-
dian victory in the
history of frontier
fighting for de-
coyed into an untenable position general
custer and his command were wiped out to
a man by the overwhelming force of in-
dians

   with the news of the disaster a wave of
                         fury swept the country the public clam-
                         ored for vengeance worse still were the
                         criticisms in that hour of the soldiers who
                         had died criticisms against their tactics
                         even against their
                         courage itself
                         charge and coun-
                         tercharge flew fast
                         even while the men
                         who could make
                         no defence lay but
                         newly buried on
                         that lonely knoll
                         by the little big
                         hom yet on that
                         very hill indian
                         and white man
                         met and pledged
                         their eternal
                         friendship memor-
                         ialized only the
                         courage and s o -
                         dierly qualities of
                         both sides

                        why can we not
 apply the lesson
 to our own daily
 lives even to the
 small disagree-
 ments and bitter-
 nesses of existence
 leave unsaid the
 criticisms forget
 the vengeful ness
 look for the good
 now instead of waiting for fifty years to
 temper our passions and open our eyes to
 keener saner more understanding sight

the loot of the lazy a

 a complete novel

 by w c tuttle
 author of romance straight shootingetc

 cultus collins once more starts out to investigate for the cattle associa-
 tion and falls into more action than he thought could be found in the
 whole southwest and the end of it all was his own discovery that it
 needs more strength to be best man at a wedding than to be best man
 in a gun-fight-with which role cultus was only too familiar

it was one of those foggy raining
dismal nights when all the world
seemed one vast drip drip of water
cold gusts of wind from the bay
where the fog warnings boomed dis-
mally boat whistles shrilled while on the
streets of san francisco little less wet
than the bay itself cable-car motormen
danced jigs upon their gongs seeking to
clear the tracks which they could hardly
see in the dim glow of their own head-
lights

  standing in the protection of a half
lighted doorway just outside the borders
of chinatown was a girl she was
dressed in a black suit black hat close
inspection would have shown that both the
suit and hat were slightly more than well
worn and were also very wet she car-
ried no umbrella she was not beautiful
but perhaps it was because of the abject

	

misery in her big dark eyes the utter
helplessness of her expression

  she was of medium height slender
white-faced in fact her face was so
white against the gloom of the doorway
which blended with her black garb that it
seemed like a white mask suspended in-
visibly against a dark curtain the wind
swirled past the doorway showering her
with rain but she did not draw back--
only stared ahead dumbly

  a policeman emerged out of the fog
peered at her as he went slowly past
glanced up the street toward the clanging
of a street car bell and went on pos-
sibly he thought she was waiting for a car

  a man emerged from a doorway farther
up the street and came down past her
he was tall rather slender his head sur-
mounted by a huge stetson sombrero
which made him look gigantic in the dim
short stories

light his heels hit hard on the sidewalk
because of the fact that he was wearing
high-heeled boots and in one hand he car-
ried a suitcase

  the street car clanged past before he
could reach the corner so he placed his
baggage on the sidewalk shoved his hands
deep in his pockets and leaned against a
post almost directly in front of where the
girl stood he turned and looked directly
at her but turned back and drew his hat
farther over liis eyes he shivered a little
he had no overcoat either

  a man came from the opposite direction
swathed in a heavy overcoat whistling aim-
lessly he was a big man the collar of his
coat touching the brim of his derby hat
he did not see the girl until he was almost
past her he stopped and came back to
her it is possible that he did not see the
tall man who leaned against the post

  hello kid he said ingratiatingly
what are you doing out in the rain all
alone 

  the girl did not rqly but drew back
against the wall the tall man turned his
head

  no coat no umbrella the man in
the overcoat laughed say you must be
up against it kid you dont look so bad
snap out of it gee you dont need to
shiver on a corner

  will you please go away asked the
girl im all right

  ill say you are kid-all right i like
you dont be uppish come on and ill
show you a good time

  please let me alone the girl spoke
softly

  dont try to kid me laughed the man
youre going with me and ill show you

the best time-

  the tall man had stepped in behind him
and a huge hand which gripped like a vise
had fastened to his shoulder

  the lady asked yuh to let her alone
yuh know the tall mans voice seemed
mild apologetic

  the man squirmed quickly who in
hell are you  he demanded

  names wouldnt mean anythin the
other said mildly

  the man jerked loose then keep your
hands off me  his is none of your busi-
ness now trot along and let us alone

  	maam the tall man spoke softly ig-
noring the threatening attitude of the other
man do yuh want to go with this man
i certainly do not

  i reckon thats final dontcha think
  the big man in the overcoat possibly did

not agree with this and he was foolish
enough to swing a right-handed blow at the
head of the tall man the overcoat was
a serious handicap his blow had only
traveled half of its arc when a thick bony
fist seemingly weighted with lead caught
him under the chin and he went backward
into the street where he went down in a
heap

  the girl stifled a scream but the tall
mans chuckle was reassuring

  did yuh know this man maam he
asked caressing his right hand

  no i did not i dont know who he
is

  neither does he-right now aint it
cold i hate this kind of weather i
spose its because i live so much on the
desert

  on the desert the girl spoke softly
where everything is dean and good-
and the sunshine-

  have you lived there

  ages and ages ago

  the tall man peered closer at her yuh
dont look old

  im twenty-two

  the tall man laughed softly yeah
yore sure ancient maam and yore all
wet and shiverin will yuh- say
thats funny i just knocked that feller
into the street for askin yuh to go with
him and i was about to do the same thing
hes gettin up

  yeah and hes goin the other way
hes stoppin at the sidewalk probly won-
derin what to do about it mebbe he dont
know what its all about

  the man had staggered to the opposite
sidewalk where he stood humped slightly
in the rain his derby hat was out in the
street but he did not seem to miss it a
policeman was coming down that side of
the street and they heard the man say
something which caused the officer to
stop

  cmon said the tall man grasping the
girl by the arm yuh never can tell what
that jigger will tell the law

  shielding her as much as possible from
the rain the tall man picked up his suit-
case and escorted the girl around the cor-
ner and down the block she did not hold
back there was too much sincerity in
the voice of this big cowboy for her to
feel afraid

  where are we going she ventured to
ask

  i know a place he said jerkily it
aint so much to look at and lotsa ornery
folks eat there but they sure sabe how to
the loot of the lazy a



cook a steak and make soup do yuh
like soup

  soup the girl spoke the word
queerly as though it was something she
had once known but had forgotten

  yeah thats it lotsa onions and meat
here we are

   he led her up a rickety stairs where the
air was redolent with odors of frying
meats garlic the hundred-and-one odors
that make up the atmosphere of a bohemian
chop-house where no questions are asked

  no head waiter met them in fact they
were almost knocked down by a hurrying
waiter carrying a tray of dishes a short-
haired broken-nosed individual a one-
time artist in the manly art of scrambling
ears

  it was warm up there amid all those
smells the tall man led the girl to a va-
cant booth which an anemic-looking
waiter was cleaning up and they sat down
opposite each other the tall man had
placed his suitcase beside the entrance
where he could watch it it was the first
time they had had a good look at each other

   the girls face was slightly flushed now
and when she removed her dripping hat
she was really pretty her hair was a
soft brown the mans face was long and
bony with a large nose keen gray eyes
and a big mouth his cheek-bones were
prominent his hair of a neutral shade
neither blonde brown nor red

  his hands were huge bony-wristed
flecked with freckles he was dressed in
a cheap brown suit flannel shirt and his
trousers were tucked in the tops of his
high-heeled boots the girl looked in-
tently at him there was no denying that
he was homely then he smiled at her
she caught her breath for a moment-and
smiled back at him

  he was not the same man when he
smiled she caught herself staring at him
while the waiter took their order wonder-
ing that a smile should so absolutely change
a man the waiter went away marveling
at the appetites these two must have

  maam said the tall man gravely my
names collins my friends call me cul-
tus cultus collins from cuyamac

  and i am just mary smith she said
simply they used to call me mary
elizabeth-when i had friends

  when yuh did have mary smith 
  yes

  uh-huh mary smith how long since
yuh ate a meal

  why-er-this noon

  yuh dont need to lie to me mary
  

elizabeth callin yuh that ought to prove
me yore friend-and yuh hadnt ought to
lie to yore friends

  mary smith looked into the gray eyes of
cultus collins and decided not to lie be-
cause he seemed to know that she lied

  it wasnt a very big meal she said
slowly

  it wasnt any meal at all mary smith

  no i guess it wasnt and then
mary smith bowed her head on her wet
anus and cried while cultus collins up-
set a bottle of catsup trying to pat her on
the shoulder and tell her to quit crying
several diners looked curiously at them
but they were of the breed that mind their
own business

  mary smith finally stopped crying dab-
bled her eyes with a wet handkerchief
and tried to appear brave while she choked
over the first meal she had eaten in two
days cultus did not question her nor
did she offer any explanation until the
steaks and baked potatoes and soup and
salads were but memories and they were
eating huge slices of apple pie and cheese
for which the place was famous

  there were roses in mary smiths
cheeks now even if her body was still wet
from the rain bit by bit she told her
story to cultus collins it was not a new
tale of woe mary smith had come from

a little town in
new england
literally ran
a w a y because
she did not want
to marry a cer-
tain man greatly
desired by her
parents and be-
cause she want-
ed to see some
of the world
she had saved
enough money to buy a ticket to the mid-
dle west and by selling a few pieces of
jewelry she was able to stretch this ticket
to san francisco where she had an aunt

  but the aunt was not there lack of
a business education lost her several fairly
good positions sickness cost her all her
slender savings and just now she was a
week overdue on her room rent and the
room was locked against her for three
days she had haunted the stores trying to
get a position but they merely looked at
her shabby clothes and told her that there
was nothing available just now

  cultus collins rubbed his chin and won-
dered what to do he was not financially
short stories

able to give her much assistance he
could give her enough money to square up
her room rent and enough for a few days
of square meals but tliat would not
remedy the clothes proposition-and with-
out clothes she could not hope to get a pay-
ing position

  just what was yuh goin to do-standm
there in the rain mary smith he asked

  she shook her head her eyes filling with
tears i-i dont know my body was
numb and i guess my mind was not far
from being in the same state it was all
so hopeless dont you see

  uh-htih i see and yet yuh wouldnt
go with that man

  she shook her head i was going the
other way

  toward the bay

  mary smith nodded dumbly cultus
sighed and shook his head

  its a queer old world mary smith
ive been here two days and i was roomin
in a little place jist up the street from
where we met i was leavin yuh see i
had plenty of time but i hurried thats
fate i reckon

  it was fate for me sighed the girl
the ay seems a long way from here
mr collins

  cultus smiled widely nothin like a
steak to make a person change their mind
another couple had entered the restau-
rant and came up to the next booth the
man was fairly young sleek-haired flash-
ily dressed the woman was wearing a
brown traveling suit trimmed with ex-
pensive furs and was wearing a small hat
she was young and beautiful in an arti-
ficial way but just now her face was con-
torted with indignation as she faced the
young man

  i suppose you think that was a smart
thing to do she fairly snapped at him
is it any of your business if i want to take
a little trip explain yourself 

  the man deposited a suitcase beside the
one cultus had placed near the booth en-
trance and took the girl by the arm

  in t lak so damn loud he advised

  get in there and sit down janice i just
wanted to be sure you wasnt doin a runout
on me this dont look right to me i
happen to know that your lawyer friend
has been up to see you twice in two days
and i know you havent any need of leeal
advice sit down

  they sat down in the next booth but
their voices were pitched loud enough for
cultus and mary smith to hear what was
said

  ill explain nothing declared the girl

let that pocketbook alone- well are
you satisfied

  it was evident that the man had investi-
gated her bag

  youre not very well heeled thats true
but that dont mean you wont meet some-
body at the ferry building  heard you
tell the taxi driver where to take you
now come clean janice you were going
to leave me flat ive bought you clothes
diamonds paid your rent furnished you a
car-and you run out on me

  gune a few moments of inaudible con-
versation the mans voice was raised in
anger

  what do you care how i make my
money youre getting rather prudish it
seems i suppose you think that if the
police get me youll go along because you
spent my money eh  well my money is
as good as the money of that dirty hum
of a lawyer hes as crooked as anybody
in the district sa-a-ay are you giv-
ing me the gate for that welcher 

  your opinions do not interest me
said the girl call me a taxi im sick
of your insinuations

  aw pull that stuff and get a vaudeville
contract why you little bum anybody
would think you was bernhardt snap
out of it get away from me ha ha
ha ha fine chance na-a-aw sit
still or ill knock you for a loop

  cultus was not so interested that he
failed to see two men come in one was
the big man he had knocked into the
street while the other was of the same type
as the man with the girl they halted mid-
way of the room ignoring the gestures of
a waiter

  then cultus heard the man in the booth
say theres that dirty welcher now
leggo me

  a dish crashed to the floor as the man
jerked away from the girl and stepped out
beyond the curtains of the booth the
two men had turned toward it and the
big man had stepped forward his hand
reaching inside his overcoat as the wo-
mans companion emerged

  there were no preliminaries it seemed
to cultus that both men knew what this
meeting would mean he saw the man at
the booth whip out a snub-nosed gun the
other man was just as quick and both guns
spat rapidly filling the room with short
snappy reports both men shooting as fast
as they could press the trigger it was all
done in the space of a few seconds the
man at the booth entrance dropped his gun

                                                        to
the loot of the lazy a



turned around as though to re-enter the
booth but his grasping hands tore down
die hanging curtains pulling them down
on top of him as he fell

  the other man was on the floor try-
ing to stay on his hands and knees a
frightened waiter had dropped a filled tray
and was running toward the back of the
room

  my god they hit that girl too some-
one yelled

  and then somebody cut off the lights
cultus and mary had got to their feet and
were at the booth entrance when the lights
went out plunging the room in darkness
but cultus had located the exit and now
he grasped his suitcase in one hand while
with the other he clung to mary smith
fairly dragging her to the top o the stairs
tearing a way through the frenzied mob

  at the top of the stairs he lifted her up
with one arm fending the stragglers away
with his suitcase and plunged down the
rickety stairs and out into the rain where
he let her down cultus knew it would
only be a minute or two until the police
would be there so he hurried mary smith
down the street around a corner where
they found a taxi

  into this they went and cultus told the
driver to take them to the ferry building
mary had said nothing and by the dim
light of the cab cultus could see that she
was very white he patted her on the
shoulder and she tried to smile

  hang onto yore nerve he whispered
and then his eyes happened to fall upon

the suitcase at
their feet

  it was not
cultus bag at
all it was the
other one

  cultus look-
ed at it closely
only in the
dark could i t
have been mistaken for the battered suit-
case cultus had owned this one was of
fine finish-an expensive thing-and was
filled to capacity but cultus did not
mention it to mary smith

  they got out at the ferry building and
went inside cultus bought tickets to
oakland it would be ten minutes before
ferry time so he led mary smith to a se-
cluded scat putting the suitcase on his lap
it was not locked he unfastened the
nickel buckles and opened the case while
mary gasped with astonishment it was
filled with womens clothes dainty things
 

which seemed to arise from the depths of
the case as they were released from pres-
sure

  on the top were two envelopes the
first contained a ticket and pullman ac-
commodations to oreana arizona and a
hundred-dollar bill the other was sealed
in a plain envelope cultus ran the blade
of his knife under the flap and opened the
envelope without damaging it together
he and mary smith read

dear m

  introducing lattice lee alias anything
you want to call her she knows pari of
the game and is a fair actress if you can
keep her sober good luck to you

                          yours

l

p s i only gave her a hundred out of
that five you sent so you only owe me a
hundred if it pans out all right better
see that she gets hers because i wont
swear to her playing on the square unless
you do

  cultus looked sideways at mary smith
as he sealed the letter and replaced it in
the suitcase he removed the envelope
containing the tickets and hundred-dollar
bill which he handed to mary smith

  why give it to me she asked looking
queerly at him

  does fate scare yuh mary elizabeth
he asked softly i was going to arizona
when yuh made me miss my car i wasnt
headin for oreana but its on my way

  but im not going to arizona

  listen to me mary elizabeth smith
yuh cant buck fate if im any judge of
things as they look that big feller was the
one that was sendin that girl janice lee
out to oreana arizona

  the big feller is plumb full of lead and
i heard somebody say that the girl was hit
she was behind him yuh remember a
lot of lead was used this night you was
headin for the bay wasnt yuh heres a
suitcase full of clothes and im sure i seen
a trunk check stickin down in a corner
theres a hundred-dollar bill from now
on yore janice lee a pretty fair actress
as long as yuh stay sober and they bet-
ter pay yuh whats cornin to yuh or youll
yelp sabe what it means

  but-but wouldnt it be wrong fal-
tered mary

 it started wrong mary	 

  as cultus fastened up the shining
buckles the ferry-boat passengers came
crowding out he picked up the suitcase
short stories

 

hold out his ham to mary smith and they
went out together

  and while they listened to the throb ot
the engines and the eery wail of the fog-
horns a police officer reported to a desk-
sergeant

  it was all over when we got there

searg two dead men and a girl they
say cant live they sure did a good job
everyone else was out of there but we got

a suitcase which one of the waiters said
speed evans brought in loring the
lawyer was all shot to pieces

  another officer came in carrying the bat-
tered suitcase and the detective bureau as-
sisted in its examination they found two
pairs of overalls several socks a red shirt
a lariat rope and several packages of to-
bacco

  if that belonged to speed evans its
too bad he got kiiled observed a hard-bit-
ted detective grinning

  why asked the desk sergeant

  why because the blamed crook must
have been starting out to do something use-
ful in the world

  what do you know about loring the
lawyer 

  enough said the detective to shed
very few tears over his demise

  and the girl 

  speeds girl searg maybe loring
tried to get her shes badly shot from
liquor got two automatic bullets through
her besides no use investigating they
cleaned up everything for themselves my
gosh that dump is a wreck

  somebody else took a wallop at loring
tonight said an officer who had been at
the restaurant he was all over mud
and his hat was in the street he tried to
teli me what it was all about but i told
him to go home and wash his face

  and thus ended the incident as far as
the police were concerned cultus collins
suitcase was thrown on a shelf along with
a lot more derelict bundles and the of-
ficers went back to their work

oreana city was a typical cattle
town of the southwest an old
place where the original settlers
had builded with adobe and was still half
adobe most of the houses were one-story
arranged along a single dusty street and
the alignment of the buildings would have
driven an engineer frantic in early days
they had builded along a crooked road and
the crooked road was still the main street
of oreana city

  it was located at the end of a branch

railroad line which served thirty miles of
cattle and mining country an irregular
freight and passenger train made daily
round trips over the line making little pre-
tense of a schedule oreana city like the
majority of cattle towns was more un-
moral than immoral the honkatonk was
the main center of amusement and gam-
bling was taken as a matter of course

  a stage line ran from oreana city to the
gold mines of welcome creek thirty miles
away being an outfitting center for both
cattlemen and miners made oreana city
somewhat the pivotal center of that little
universe it was also the county seat

  three miles northwest of oreana city
was the ranch of the iazy a three miles
southwest of oreana city was the ranch
of the star x between these two outfits
was a feud which had lasted so long that
no one paid much attention to it any more

  that is they hadnt until the funeral of
old jud ault owner of the lazy a over
a year previous to the funeral jud ault
had been shot from ambush the bullet in-
juring his spine and causing partial paraly-
sis since then he had never been able to
walk it was generally believed that the
bullet was fired by one of eph wheelers

star x outfit if
not by old eph
himself but
there was no
evidence to con-
vict them

  the feud had
started so long
ago that no one
seemed to know
just what had
caused it some
said it started over a card game in which
whisky played a prominent part others
said it was over the woman who married
jud ault and died when their little girl
faith was but a tiny slip of a child at
any rate jud ault and eph wheeler had
been bunkies before this trouble but had
not met face to face in over twenty years

  jud ault even before his injury which
finally killed him was a grim sour-faced
old man quick of temper he hated man-
kind and did not hesitate to say it the
lazy a made ault rich mining engineers
had urged the old man to lease or sell part
of his ranch which was rich enough to
make him a millionaire but he refused
he hated miners they dug holes in the
ground he did not want to be rich

  faith had grown up in awe of her par-
ent the prettiest girl in the country but
the loot of the lazy a



denied of suitors woe unto the gay cow-
boy who tried to jingle his spurs across the
threshold of the lazy a ranch-house and
when she was eighteen she married jack
keene a gambler ran away with him
sjent a short honeymoon and came back
for the paternal blessing

  but what they found was a door closed
against them never again did jud ault
speak to his daughter he drew back in
his shell like an old turtle even refusing
to go to town and when it was definitely
decided that jud ault had made his final
decision jack keene gambler former law-
yer according to miles lane a local at-
torney who had formed a friendship for
keene disappeared from oreana city-
alone

  not even then did jud ault relent and
take back his daughter who had no means
of support men went to him and urged
him to take care of her even if he did not
want to see her and he cursed them out
there was no doubt in the minds of every-
one that jack keene had had an eye on the
lazya when he married faith but had
sneaked away like a cur when he found
that his marriage did not mean money

  then came the keene baby men said
that old jud ault would relent now but
lie never saw his grandchild faith keene
lived in a little shack of a house which jack
had partly furnished she tried to make a
living by taking in washing but the re-
turns were too small compared to the phy-
sical labor involved also she was obliged
to compete with a chinese laundry-which
some of the cowboys offered to put out of
business and give her a clear field but
she declined their offer

  things were breaking very badly for
faith keene when miles lane came to her
with some money which he told her came
from jack keene she did not wonder
why he did not send her this money direct
because she was too thankful to get it
lane would not tell her where jack keene
was every month the oreana city law-
yer would bring her enough for her
monthly wants and she was able to strug-
gle along and take care of her baby

   east of oreana city about four miles
were the tumbledown ranch buildings of the
cross arrow owned by badger hill and
his son known as shitless they were
veritable range derelicts these two bad-
ger was a short squatty bewhiskered sort
of a man who greatly resembled his name-
sake his vocabulary was limited to few
words-mostly profane

   shifless was a big hulk of a man less

    

than thirty years of age he was not un-
handsome in his big lumbering way his
features were strong blocky and his wist-
ful gray eyes seemed to be continually won-
dering at the world from beneath a huge
mop of blonde hair which seemed forever
to stand on end

  it was hinted that the cross arrow ex-
isted through the taking of oreanas-
calves which had escaped the branding-
iron of their original owners farther to
the north these animals were designated as
mavericks and it was also hinted that
badger hill was not averse to forcing an
oreana-taking a calf away from its
mother that he might later run it on the
cross arrow and claim it for his own

  shifless hill had in a way grown up
with faith keene and always admired her
from afar jud ault had detested badger
hill and his big cowpuncher son-mak-
ing it mutual because both badger and
shifless hated the hardfaced owner of
the lazy a

  eph wheeler was a mild-mannered old
man thin-faced keen-eyed one of the
old type of cattlemen who cursed with no
trace of emotion and fanned the hammer
of his sixshooter when the need arose
with the air of a man who had a slightly
disagreeable task to do and wished to do it
as quickly as possible

  dude wheeler the son was a tall
straight-backed young man who walked so
straight in his high-heeled boots that it
seemed as though a gust of wind would
blow him over backward he was thin of
face with a wide mouth showing excellent
teeth when he smiled his eyes were
deep-set black as india-ink beneath heavy
brows while his nose was bony

  his love for gaudy clothes had won him
his cognomen and he was the flashiest
cowboy in the oreana country but dude
wheeler was a tophand cowboy ready to
fight drink gamble or race he had been
taught to hate the lazy a but now there
was no lazy a as far as the ault family
was concerned faith had been disowned
and no one ever heard jud ault speak of
having any relatives so as long as there
was no ault family to fight it seemed that
the feud would or had died no one con-
sidered that faith keene was an ault

  the lazy a was in the hands of idaho
breen who had been aults foreman for
years idaho was small of stature as gray
as a badger and with about the same dispo-
sition perhaps association with jud ault
had caused breen to become cynical never
smiling
ip

  cleve sears the sheriff had well de-
scribed idaho breen when he said if i
was goin to pick out a mail to do a first-
class job of murderin somebody id pick
idaho breen cause hed be sure that it
was a neat job-and i dont reckon his
conscience would ever bother him at
all

  not that idaho had ever killed anybody
-not in the oreana country at least no
one had ever heard him mention the feud
between the lazy a and the star x but
for years he had ridden with a winchester
rifle in a boot under his saddle fender

  it had been hinted that dude wheeler
had found faith ault rather easy to look
upon but because she was an ault he had
rarely seen her seldom did the lazy a
and the star x outfits meet in oreana city
but when they did both sides were coldly
civil they came to the same dances
thereby causing the sheriff much mental
anguish for fear of
trouble as he wanted
to play square with
both sides

  but the aults were
gone now and there
were only idaho breen
and his three punch-
ers omaha woods
mex leone and
pie ide but they were enough in
range language a man had to be salty to
work for the lazy a omaha woods
was broad of beam with the neck and
shoulders of a wrestler and the mustache
of a viking

  mex leone was small slender almost
as black as an indian possibly the best
bronc rider in the country pie ide was
rangy built tall powerful men likened
him to abraham lincoln in his facial as-
pect but the physical likeness was the only
way in which he resembled the great eman-
cipator pie ide was as hard-bitted as a
foundup bucker but with a sense of humor
which neither omaha nor mex seemed to
possess

  it was about a week after the funeral of
jud ault sliifless hill was on his
monthly peanut spree while the other
cowboys spent their monthly salary or a
great part of it for liquor and cards shif-
ess hill consumed large quantities of pea-
nuts and a sprinkling of peppermint candy
hearts chuckling to himself over the inane
inscriptions thereon

  just now he had strolled to the front
gate of faith keenes little place where
faith was sitting on the porch with the lit-

short stories

tie boy she spoke to shi hess who
opened the gate and came in sprawling
lazily on the steps

  he offered faith some peanuts but she
declined smiling at the boyish actions of
the big cowboy who poked a finger at the
boy who chuckled with delight

  hyah makin it he asked faith

   oh all right shifless

  uh-huh shifless crunched a mouth-
ful of peanuts his big hands hanging
limply on his knees thas food mrs
keene glad to hear it say he looked
up at her quizzically i heard that yore
dad left a will

  faith looked blankly at him why i-

i never heard-

  well he did i heard idaho breen
tellin about it miles lane helped him
make it out idaho signed it so he said
some of the boys got to talkin about the
lazy a and some of em seemed to think
that you was agoin to git it but breen
said there was a will he didnt tell much
about it except that there was a niece or
somethin like that mixed up in it i was
a wonderin if miles lane had told yuh any-
thin about it yuh know

  he didnt shifless faith sighed
deeply no i didnt know anything
about it

  uh-huh i hear lotsa fellers goin
around kinda admittin that jud ault was
all right i suppose thats the thing to do
after a mans dead and gone but they all

knowed that-

  he was my father shifless

  thats all right bein a father seems
to be more or less of a responsibility mrs
keene but yore dad shucked his yeah
hes dead and gone and you get tears in
yore eyes when folks talk about him
mebbe yore right ive got a dad shif-
less smiled slowly his wistful eyes fixed
upon the little boy on faiths lap and lotsa
folks say he aint worth nothin hes a
mean voiced hard-fisted old pelican yeah
i know him better than anybody else does

  they say he steals cattle but they
aint never caught him at it mebbe hes a
thief and he sure uses bad language some-
times he gets drunk and acts pretty rough
but as long as i can remember mrs
keene hes never said a mean thing to me
except shifless smiled and filled his
mouth with peanuts except the time he
said that i shore as hell was a throw-back
to my monkey ancestors dad hates pea-
nuts

  faith laughed and the boy chuckled as
though he understood

                                                         
the loot of the lazy a

  yuh named him jack didnt yuh

asked shi fless

  yes softly jack keene junior
uh-huh well shi fless got to his
feet brushing the peanut shells off his lap
ill be anglin along say i was jist a-
thinkin out at the ranch ive got a little
painted bronc he aint biggern a minute
been goin to break him to ride but hes so
small that m feet hit the ground i was
jist a-wonderin if little jack wouldnt like
him

   oh thats thoughtful of you shifless
but dont you realize that little jack wont
be able to ride a horse for a long time
uh-huh well i-uh-thas all right
too yore welcome ill give him the
bronc and keep it out at the ranch until
yuh need it them painted ones shore live
a long time well good day mrs keene
i reckon ill git more peanuts and head
fr home

   shifless walked back to the main street
and was heading toward the new york
general merchandise store when he met
cleve sears the sheriff sears was short
and fat with a full-moon sort of a face
his idea of a good time was to sit in the
shade and whittle

  hello shifless he said jerkily too
much fat had made him short of breath

   lo cleve drawled shifless what-
cha know

  i know that idaho breen is sore as
hell know what he done this mornin
so he says he found fifty-three lazy a cow
hides in a prospect hole somewhere be-
tween the lazy a and the road to welcome
creek said the damn hole was about
fifty feet deep and he didnt know that
them hides was there until he smelled em
smellin kinda deep wasnt he  smiled
shifless

  probly the smell come out the mouth
of the shaft

  probly still that aint so bad for
him hides are worth good money right
now

  the sheriff breathed heavily i dunno
idahos mad says hell show the star x
where to git off at

  shifless cracked his few remaining pea-
nuts poured them into his mouth and be-
an chewing complacently didja hear
hat old jud ault wrote out a will before
he died

  somebody said he did left the lazy
a to a niece of his

  and left his daughter out in the cold
yeah thats true i hear her husband
is sendin her money every month thats
to

how she gits along shifless he cant be
such an awful jigger if he does that for
her

  must be all right mumbled shifless
dont yuh reckon the feud between the
lazy a and the star x is ended

  it ort to be shifless still yuh
never can tell they tell me that this niece
of jud aults is named ault-mary ault
ordinarily id say that a woman aint got
no business runnin a cow ranch but if
she keeps idaho breen there she wont have
to do much of the runnin idahos been in
charge ever since jud ault got shot
uh-huh the lazy a is worth a lot of
money cleve i had a talk with one of
them minin engineers bout a year ago
he was pokin around the hills out near our
place and he told me that the surface show-
in on the lazy a was worth a cold mil-
lion

  yeah i heard it too old jud knowed
it was there but the lazy a made him
plenty of money-and he hated holes in the

ground i asked
miles lane if
the old mans
will stated that
no minin was
ever to be done
 the lazy a
but he said it
didnt

  i was jist
w o n d e r i n if
faith keene
couldnt contest that will cleve

  miles says she cant because the old
man left her one whole dollar he says
he disowned her and didnt want to even
leave her the silver dollar but miles
showed him where she could bust the will
if he didnt mention her at all

  uh-huh shifless picked his teeth
with a match it pears to me that them
damn lawyers jist has to be accurate even
if it wrongs the right folks well im
all out of peanuts see yuh later cleve
s-long shifless

  shifless sauntered on up the street he
saw idaho breen in front of miles lanes
office talking with lane they nodded
coldly to him as he went past and entered
the store just beyond

 miles lane was above average height
slightly stooped his sandy hair was thin
and wiry his eyes close-set were buried
beneath beetling brows which gtew to-
gether over the bridge of his thin nose
the hinges of his wide jaws were knobby
from incessant gum-chewing but al-
short stories

 

though the jaw was wide at its hinge it
tapered clown to a weak chin which gave
his head the appearance o-f being topheavy

  he invariably wore a winged collar and
a stringy black tie which no doubt gave
him a judicial air lane was a bottle
drinker perhaps so because of its econ-
omy and as a result he was very often
under the influence of liquor

  you said shed be here wednesday
eh questioned idaho breen his cold eyes
studying the flushed face of the lawyer
yes wednesday breen

  uh-huh when is the will to be read 
oh after she gets here well have
the judge and the sheriff there to hear it
i suppose the best thing to do will be to
take her right out to the lazy a as soon
as she comes

  thats what i aim to do miles i was
just wonderin if faith keene will make
any move to contest the will it looks as
though she could do that

  if she had enough money to make a
fight of it idaho im goin to have a talk
with her and see how she feels about it
but she cant do much the will gives her
one dollar thats a legal point and
everybody around here knows that jud
ault wouldnt let her iq his house he
disowned her	t

  no i dont think shes got a chance to
contest the will in fact i dont think she
ever thought of such a thing shes
proud	t

  how much do yuh really think the lazy
a is worth miles

  the lawyer smiled thoughtfully the
mineral rights are easily worth a million
i talked with those engineers when they
prospected it and they said it was so rich
that they were afraid to estimate one of
em got drunk and talked they were em-
ployed by eastern capital and  happen to
know that jud ault was offered more
money than he knew existed just for the
mineral rights

  i know that said idaho ive liad
assays made too oh its there miles
you bet its there now what about
those cow-hides	

j ust what i told you that prospect
hole is full of lazy a hides that damn

  tr sr	used lhat deep shaft to get

nd of lazy a hides theyve been eat in
lazy a meat for years and ive wondered
where they threw the hides

  any proof asked lane judicially

 proof no how dm yuh prove
who shot a beef theyve all been shot
 then drop the subject until youve got

no use starling a

proof idaho theres
battle with the star x

   just let em keep on eatin our meat

 eh 

   have you ever eaten any star x beef 
yore damn well right i have but
not that much

  the amount doesnt matter what i
want you to do is to forget those hides
if you can get the goods on the star x
im for it but right now we dont want
 stir up any war get this girl estab-
lished out at the lazy a breen i sup-
pose every cowpuncher in the country will
want to marry her

  breen laughed coldly i suppose my
own outfit have taken to washin their
necks ever since they heard she was coin-
in

  shed e a good catch lane laughed
softly i might marry her myself
you better quit drinkm advised
idaho coldly

 i dont drink enough to hurt me

 well i dont want yuh to drink enough
to hurt me

  miles lane laughed i guess you
wont get hurt much just forget those
cow-hides idaho well deal with the
star x when we get the goods on em
anvway rustling is petty larceny beside
what well get

 something prompted idaho to step over
to the front window which looked out on
the crooked main street leaning against
the wall near the window was shifless
hill still eating peanuts idaho motioned
to lane who came over
apparently shi fless was
in eating more peanuts

i idaho watched the big cross arrow
 puncher who finally dusted the peanut
shells oft his shirt front shoved the re-
mainder in his chapps pocket and walked
away he did not even glance toward the
window idaho stepped back his eyes
squinting narrowly

  do yuh suppose that big fat-head was
listenin to what he might hear

 i dont think so breen anyway
what could he hear

   nothin i reckon i dont like him
   hes harmless

   yeah i suppose he is except when it
comes to stealin calves

  anyway our conversation was none
of his business

   but perhaps shifless hill felt differ-
ently alout it he untied his horse at the
new york store hitch-rack mounted and
rode toward home he had not stopped in

to the window
merely engaged
the loot of the lazy a



front of miles lanes office with the inten-
tion of listening in fact he had heard
only the dull mumble of conversation until
lane had raised his voice slightly and said
just forget those cow-hides what do
we care rustling is petty larceny beside
what well get

  beside what well get muttered shif-
less now jist why did he say that i
wonder 

dear al

  you heard about me getting shot it

a cripple-paralysis bullet lodged against
my spine and the doctors are afraid to take
it away ive lost my nerve al im as

tion i dont want no cow detective hang-
ing around me but i do zvant a man zvho

lud ault

  cultus collins looked up from reading
the letter a gray-haired man with kindly
blue eyes was seated at a desk beside him
idly drawing circles on a desk blotter with
a pencil on the walls were detail maps of
arizona a meat packers calendar a
framed picture of a longhorn steer from
the adjoining room came the clicking of a
typewriter

   

  i had a hard time locating you collins
said the gray-haired man  got that let-
ter nearly three weeks ago

  yuh say this lazy a is at oreana
city

  yes have you ever been there

  cultus smiled grimly but shook his head
no do you believe in fate

  in fate why i dont know collins
do you 

  im beginnin to cultus smiled
softly as he folded up the letter thats
a queer sort of a letter al theres a lot
in it a lot of the soul of a bitter man
mebbe i better see if i can help him i
dunno what he wants done do you 

  no perhaps its merely hallucina-
tions cultus i dont know much about
the place if you take the job itll be up
to you to go there and see what you can
find out ill give you a note to ault so
hell know youre on the job

  all right

  the secretary of the cattlemens asso-
ciation penciled a note for cultus while the
lean-faced cowboy grinned softly over the
manufacture of a cigarette grinned to
himself because he still had an hour to
catch the same train that mary smith was
taking to oreana city

  cultus had had no inkling that the cattle
association was going to send him to
oreana city he had told mary smith
good-by and had promised to join her as
soon as possible to help carry out the de-
ception neither of them knew what it
meant but there was no question that it was
a crooked deal and now the association
was sending cultus to the same location

  what seems so funny to you  queried
the secretary as he folded the note cul-
tus grinned widely but did not reply they
shook hands and cultus went back to the
busy street of an arizona metropolis he
headed for the depot where he found
mary smith

  part of the hundred-dollar bill had been
invested in a modest gray suit and a small
hat there were roses in her cheeks now
as she sprang up to greet cultus

  ive got to buy a ticket to oreana he
grinned

  oh are you going with me she asked

  v-ah

house mex leone stopped putting on a

been shining his boots with rising sun
stove-polish which was smelling to high
heaven

pion said omaha he thinks he can

body else that was my collar provin

omaha mildly

omaha when tliat girl takes a look at

in to accept one of omahas clean collars

  probly

  are you aimin to make a play for thii
heiress asked omaha resignedly

xfrft-

  jist like a road-runner pickin a grass-
hopper said pie seriously aint it
legitimate shes single there aint
nothin in the constitution of the state that
says i aint eligible is there im a clean
whole-souled young feller and ive got am-
bitions to be somethin in the world

  if youd a said you was clean-souled
id keep still cause yore soul aint visible
grinned mex you aint took a bath
since yore bronc bogged down in the little
muddy last spring with all the land shes
gettin on the old lazy a i dont reckon
the lady would want any extra real estate
pie

  mex dodged gracefully through the
doorway just ahead of the shoe-brush
which pie hurled the length of the room
it was a good throw-as far as velocity
was concerned-but the angle was bad and
omaha looked up just in time to get the
handle of it across the bridge of his nose
omaha went backward over a chair land-
ing on the back of his neck near the door
howling bloody murder nothing could
ever convince omaha that pie ide had not

                                                        
the loot of the lazy a



intended to hit him he came to his feet
swearing a streak blood running from his
injured nose eyes half blinded

  his grasping hands came in contact with
his belt and gun on a bunk and he fired
one wild shot as pie ide went under a bunk
on his hands and knees

  gdigytih wailed omaha he stag-
gered to the center of the room one hand
held to his streaming nose as he tried to
locate pie under the bunk

  whats goin on in here idaho
breen had just heard the commotion and
had come from the stable what hap-
pened to you omaha put down that
gun

  it was an accident idaho panted pie
sticking his nose and eyes out between a
drapery of blankets which hung down over
the end of the bunk i throwed that
brush at mex and omaha walked into it
take the gun away from him idaho

  id waddent no dab aggcided denied
omaha he idtedded to hid be

  he throwed it at me mex stuck his
head around the corner of the doorway
but youve got my consent to kill him
omaha

  some of you damn fools are goin to
kill each other one of these days declared
idaho why dontcha ever grow up

  omaha tossed the gun to the bunk and
turned to the broken mirror to examine his
injury the nose was swelling and was
tinged with purple across the bridge
idaho grunted disgustedly and walked out
while pie crawled from beneath the bunk
and advised omaha to hold his breath and
stop the bleeding

  will thad stob id asked omaha wear-
ily-

  sure it will

  omaha tried it but with no results
how log he asked heavily how log
do you hab to hold id 

  all depends on the person said pie
seriously some die a lot harder than
others

  but this time pie had secured omahas
gun and walked outside to join mex
idaho was hitching up the buggy team
with the intention of going to oreana city
to meet the train idaho had not dressed
for the reception of the heiress of the
lazy a but the three cowboys felt differ-
ently about it all they knew was that
mary ault old jud aults niece was com-
ing to the lazy a idaho had told them
that she was a fairly young woman it
was not often that the lazy a boys dressed

up but when they did they made an event
of it

  pie had suggested that they all go to the
depot to meet her but idaho vetoed that
idea idaho drove away it would be
several hours before train time omaha
came from the bunkhouse looking queer
with his purple nose which resembled a
potato in contour

  all dressed up and no place to go
complained pie its hours before the
train comes in

  and nothin to drink on the ranch
wailed omaha id sell my soul for a
shot of liquor

  got over yore hayfever eh grinned
mex yore nose looks like the handle
on a door

  thasall right growled omaha ne
mind my nose

  it strikes me that somethin must be
done said pie we cant gloom around
here for hours dressed thisaway sup-
pose we go to town keep out of sight of
idaho and when the train whistles we can
head for home

  yore voice is tuned for my heart-
strings said mex how about you
omaha

  pshaw im halfway there right now
cmon

  and while the three lazy a cowboys
headed for town four other riders buck
wing heinie moriarity klondike
evans and joe chevrier of the star x
foregathered in the oreana saloon and
gambling house with enough money in
their pockets to make the visit worth while

  buck wing was a long-legged buck-
tooth cowboy with one eye slightly out of
line and one of his ears in prize fight
parlance was slightly cauliflowered mor-
iarity was short broad of shoulder typi-
cally celtic even to his love of battle

  klondike evans was of medium height
bald-headed sallow complectioned which
accentuated the wispy black mustache on
his long upper lip joe chevrier was a lit-
tle red-faced french-canadian voluble
excitable the butt of most of the rough
jokes originated by buck and heinie

  the lazy a and the star x outfits had
never met since the funeral of jud ault
personally there had never been any bad
blood between the cowboys but they had
been loyal to their own outfits respecting
the ancient enmity

  idaho breen saw that the star x outfit
was at the oreana so he tied his buggv
team in front of the new york store and
gave the oreana a wide berth  his was
short stories

 

as pie ide had expected so the lazy a trio
tied their horses at the rear of the oreana
and made their entrance through the rear

door

  the four star x boys were at the bar
omaha pie and mex stopped alout mid-
way of the room looking at the star x

  buck wing grinned widely he had
imbibed plenty of liquor and his soul was

mellow toward

everylxxly

   s far as i
kin see he said
slowly t here
aint no feud
left hyah
cowboys

  and for the
first time since
the feud started the star x punchers
shook hands with those from the lazy a
after about the sixth drink omaha offered
this explanation

  this here miss ault which the old
man designates in his will-paper as bein
the one he chooses to own the lazy a is
due to hit oreana city this evenin idaho
breen aims to take her out to the ranch
thats the reason were all duded up this-
away when that train toots for oreana
city we fogs for home and lines up at the
front door to welcome her

ishly my my i dont see how you boys

copal preacher you shee it was that col-
lar that fooled me

lap the ends over to fit his neck

  my gawd he shore is a dude ap-
plauded buck wing yore all pretty
gaudy if yuh ask me still its perfecly
proper under the circumstances what-
cha say joe

  joe chevrier hadnt said anything
liquor made him just a trifle mournful
it seemed he looked gloomily upon the
three lazy a punchers

  say noting  he replied me im
jus link wat somebody say bout star x
kill lazy a beef and trow hide in de pros-
pec hole 	

  drop it growled heinie this is
no time to stir up a lot of smelly cow-hides
you frog-eater

  frenchy was properly squelched but
continued to glower he was just drunk
enough to hold a grudge and his remarks

brought a decided chill over the festivities

  im for buryin any hatchet that might
be around said pie ide we might as
well all be good little friends together

  sure thing agreed buck wing im
willin but you know yourself pie that
idaho breen made some remarks that are
hard to overlook

pect hole from here to welcome creek

hitched up his belt his eyes snapping

klondike

  argiunents were forgotten for the mo-
ment while seven men drank joe chev-
rier threw his glass in a cuspidor smash-
ing it into a hundred pieces

  i drink no more wit lazy a declared
joe waving his arms im insult from

ship

erently tak dat off by gosh i no

the loot of the lazy a

hides wailed omaha

buck wing thickly

four ant-eaters

  if you fellers has got any quantity of
brawlin to do i wish youd go someers

  whos brawlin demanded klondike
this here is jist an argument among men
-so keep out of it

  both sides knew that there was no chance
tor peace omaha hitched up his belt
spat dryly and said all right you star
ks dont want no peace i can see that
io well go away that cowhide matter
iont mean nothin to any of us all i
an say is that if yuh ate all the beef that
was inside them hides yore shore plenty
iat on good meat

  then the three lazy a cowboys filed out
hrough the front door and headed down
he street toward the rawhide saloon just
r well enough organized to ignore the fact
hat idaho breen might meet them

all six of em went eh joe chevrier
rooked owlishly toward the front door
there was only three said klondike
by gosh dere was six went out ex-
ploded joe i tell you wat im sore

  you couldnt whip a canary declared
  uck wring shut up

  but dey accuse wailed joe

  they ort to be teached a lesson ob-
    ed klondike

 they will be nodded buck ive
 ot a scheme that train gets in after
 ark and there wont be nobody there to
 leet the girl except idaho breen howd
 be- buck scratched his chin
 houghtfully howd it be to swipe that
 

girl and take her out to the star x

  ill buy a drink exploded heinie
youve spoke yore piece

when idaho breen came to oreana
city he drove his team to the little
depot where he left it to await the
arrival of mary ault he went to the de-
pot where the agent divulged the informa-
tion that the train would be about three
hours late

  i got a telegram for jud ault he grin-
ned didnt just know how to deliver it
-do you breen 

thats funny aint it laughed idaho
mebbe i better take it along with me
it might concern the business yuh know
sure here she is lookin for some-
body on the train 

  idaho pocketed the telegram yeah
the new owner of the lazy a is due in on
this train

  that so oh i did hear about jud
ault making out a will

  idaho nodded and walked out to his
team he opened the telegram it was
from the secretary of the cattlemens as-
sociation and read

  sending you best man for job will iden-
tify himself

al traynor

  idaho leaned against a buggy wheel and
pondered over the telegram

  sendin you best man for job he mut-
tered what job a telegram to a dead
man and ai traynor is secretary of
the association i wonder jist what job
they had in mind

  he folded up the telegram and went back
up the street the sheriff was sitting in
front of the new york store whittling
his eyes scanning the front of the oreana
saloon idaho spoke to him and the sher-
iff moved over to give him a seat

  yore gang and the star x gang are
over there in the oreana offered the sher-
iff pointing with
his pocket-knife
theyve been in
there for about
fifteen minutes
and nobody aint
been throwed
out yet

idaho scowled
a 

eh

heavily

gettin

drunk

 all got drunk corrected the sheriff
i

short stories

tust at that moment the three lazy a lys
filed out and headed for the rawhide none
of them were able to follow a chalk-line
they riled into the rawhide and the sheriff

breathed easier

  well im glad thats over he said
thankfully

  the sun had gone down and it would
soon be dark they were lighting one of
the hanging lamps in the oreana when joe
chevrier and klondike evans came from
the place both of them were unsteady on
their feet it seemed that klondike was
trying to argue joe out of doing a certain
thing of which joe was bound and deter-
mined to do

  my gosh im insult roared the little
cowpuncher angrily as they came across
the street lie tak it off klondike

  thasall ri mumbled klondike you
aint got no shense i tell you for-frgit
it da-aw-gone yuh whatsa use-

  ho ho joe had seen idaho and the
sheriff he braced his feet roaring out
his war-whoop you sonn-of-a-gonn

  klondike made an ineffectual grab at joe
who had dragged out his six-shooter stag-
gering out of klondikes reach

  wham crash his bullet smashed
through the window just over idahos and
the sheriffs heads

  wham wham two more bullets prac-
tically ruined the rest of the window while
idaho and the sheriff running like a team
of heavy-bodied fire-horses headed for
the sheriffs office

  wham another bullet struck the side
of the building as they fell through the
doorway heinie moriarity and  buck
wing staggered out of the oreana while
from the rawhide a short block down the
street and almost opposite the sheriffs of-
fice came the boys from the lazy a seek-
ing to find what the shooting was about

  wham joes fifth bullet struck the
dirt just in front of omaha woods who
almost fell over backward when the spray
of gravel blew up in his face and with-
out any further argument pie ide drew his
six shooter and proceeded to take pot-shots
at the star x gang

  a bullet knocked klondikes sombrero
oit and when he stooped over to get it
another hunk of lead threw gravel in his
lace so he forgot the hat and went gallop-
ing drunkenly toward the doorway of the
jreana where he caught his toe on the step
and fell halfway through the doorway

  the shooting lecame general except joe
uievner who was the cause of the whole
thing and who was tryinfg to stuff more

cartridges into his sixshooter but with lit-
tle success buck wing had run in close
to the side of the oreana while heinie sat
down in the street shooting across one

bended knee

  bang a note entirely different from
tliat of the six-gun joe chevrier yeljed
like an injured pup and galloped toward the
far corner of the oreana grasping at the
rear of himself the enraged sheriff had
poked a ten-gauge shotgun through a pane
in his office window and had given the
star x frenchman something to think
about besides loading his gun

  heinies gun was empty so he crawled
on his hands and knees back to the oreana
the lazy a outfit had backed to the door
of the rawhide only to find it barred
against them the saloonkeeper was tak-
ing no chances of them using his place as
a fort

  is anybody hurt panted pie ide as
they leaned against the barred door

  i got tny mustache full of gravel
wailed omaha and some of it hit my
sore nose

  didja see what happened to the frog-
eater chuckled mex the sheriff
busted him with a load of duckshot

  i wonder what started it grinned
pie as he reloaded his long colt 
lets go across the street and set on the
sidewalk them snakehunters are tod
drunk to hit a house and itll soon lie dark-

  yuh didnt see us hittin anythin
didja inquired omaha pawing at his
mustache were a fine lot of shooters
we never hit anybody

  we fanned em out of the street didnt
we fleered mex didja want to kill
em omaha

  well i didnt want to kiss em lets
sneak around and get in the back door of
the sheriffs office

  and git a hidefull of duck-shot eh
pie ide shook his head so hard that his hat
fell off weve got all the war we can
handle without foolin with the sheriff and
idaho breen

  the star x boys were of the same opin-
ion as three of them leaned against the
oreana bar klondike was bitter his
fairly new stetson had a jagged hole in the
crown

  well what started it anyway de-
manded buck wing

  joe chevrier took a shot at idaho breen
and the sheriff

  danged fool did we kill any of the
lazy a

  nobody seemed to know joe came
the loot of the lazy a



ihrough the rear doorway limping he
ad sobered considerably

bv gar im get stoong by fortee bee
exclaimed behin me im feel like
centi-peed walk hall over me

yuh got a load of duck-shot in yore
kick snorted buck wing disgustedly
its too damn bad he didnt use a can-
lon what made yuh start shootin out
here you danged canuck yuh shore
ut us in bad

  well joe grimaced painfully im
-ee dat ida-hoo and im so insult about de
jow-hide

  we might go down and apologize to
be lazy a boys suggested heinie mor-
arity theyre probly in the rawhide
but that suggestion didnt go well with
buck wing except for the bartender
they had the oreana all to themselves
what few other patrons had been in there
had sneaked out the back door during the
shooting and had given the main street a
wide berth the bartender while still
sticking to the ship did not feel any too
secure

  i dont apologize to nobody declared
buck if joe wants to apologize to idaho

and the sheriff-

  she dont snorted joe im ver
sore jus now

  id suggest that we go home said
klondike mourning over his sombrero

  and let the lazy a think they run us
tout

  let em think what they win what
they dont know wont hurt em

  the lazy a bunch sitting like three buz-
zards on the sidewalk saw the star x
rboys ride away from the oreana hitch-
rack and chuckled with glee it was too
mark to see them get their horses at the
-rack idaho breen and the disgruntled
sheriff also saw them ride away and
breathed a sigh of relief

we whipped em declared mex
we shore did by golly chuckled
omaha here comes idaho and the sher-
iff i suppose theyre cornin to congratu-
late us

  but idaho breen was not in a congratu-
latory frame of mind

  why in hell didnt you fellers stay at
the raru and behave yourselves he de-
manded angrily cornin down here and
startin trouble

  who started any trouble grunted pie
ide if we hadnt been here to turn the
 ide you and the sheriff would a had to
pull another alamo theyd shore made
yuh hard to catch

       

  you fellers started it yuh mixed
with that star x outfit in the oreana and

made trouble
well what-
cha goin to do
about it asked
omaha is this
a free country
or are we work-
in for a czar
idaho debat-
ed good cow-
hands were not
plentiful he knew he was just on the
verge of losing all three of them

  well he said slowly i suppose its
all right but i didnt want you boys
drunk when miss ault comes dang it
that aint the right spirit boys she
probly aint used to seein a lot of drunken
punchers

  whos drunk demandedomaha
idaho shook his head mebbe i was
mistaken i-i was judgin from the
shootin that yuh wasnt cold sober why
some of yore bullets hit the sheriffs of-
fice and it aint noways in the line between
where you was and the middle of the
street

  oh we didnt want to kill em said
pie ide all we wanted to do was to
scare em out of town so theyd let you and
the sheriff out of the office

  my shotgun settled that said the sher-
iff panting heavily i handed joe chev-
rier an ounce and a quarter of number fives
and hell itch for a long time

  there aint no fun left anyway said
mex morn fully id jist as soon go
home

  same here nodded omaha we
was jist killin time anyway

  so the lazy a boys went behind the
oreana where they mounted their horses
and headed for home idaho tried to find
miles lane but the lawyer was not in evi-
dence the town had recovered its com-
posure after the bloodless battle and there
was much speculation as to what would
happen next time the two outfits met
it was almost time for the train arrival
when idaho went to the depot he went
in the waiting room where the agent told
him the train would be in very soon then
he went out on the platform and walked
around the corner of the depot with the in-
tention of changing the position of his
half broke buggy team which might get
frightened at the train but as he swung
around the corner three or four men piled
upon him bearing him down by sheer
weight of numbers an old saddle-blan-
ket was flung over his head and inside of
two minutes idaho breen was trussed up
like a mummy and dumped unceremoni-
ously behind the depot

  the train ground ponderously up to the
station and when mary smith climbed
down the steps assisted by the gray-haired
conductor she was met by luck wing and
klondike evans of the star x behind
her came cultus collins apparently paying
no attention to her

  howdy miss greeted buck wing a
half smile on his face are you miss
ault 

  why yes said mary who was pre-
pared to be alias anything she was called

  klondike grasped her suitcase and she
walked with buck who guided her around
to the hitch-rack where the frightened
team was being taken care of by heinie
and joe mary noted a strong smell of
liquor about them

  it seemed settled that klondike was to
do the driving he got in and took the
lines while heinie and joe clung to the
bridles of the rearing broncos

  head for the ranch said buck
well catch yuh

  youll go some if yuh do snorted
klondike surging back on the lines the
team whirled around almost upsetting the
buggy and went up the main street of
oreana city like a pair of racehorses head-
ing for the wire

  mary got little view of oreana city as
she was entirely occupied in clinging to
the seat of the open buggy the road was
far from smooth and they went bouncing
off the street into a wide sweep of low
hills gray and blue in the starlight klon-
dike clung to the frail lines content to
keep the running team in the road

  the light buggy meant nothing to the
broncos running wild cold-jawed a
mile or more reeled out behind them klon-
dike knew of a bad spot in the road where
 washout had cut a deep furrow across
the highway to go into this at top speed
would mean a smashup he shortened
his lines braced his feet and pulled stead-
ily but the cold-jawed broncs did not
mind the pull on the straight-bar bits

  klondike still half drunk realized that
things were not working out just right
he shot a glance at the girl beside him
who was clinging to the seat with both
hands and surged back on the lines again
he knew the washout was very close now

  snap the left line broke and came
back striking klondike in the chest and

stories

throwing all the pull on the right line it
swerved the team to the right and a wheel

went over a mesquite snag throwing klon-
dike off the seat

  just beyond here an old road turned to
the right an old road which had not been
used for years the buggy slewed around
skidded dangerously and then straightened
up as the frantic team headed up the old
road

  mary was thrown off the seat and down
against the dash but managed to get back
to the seat her mind was in a whirl as
she realized that the driver had leen thrown
off she wanted to jump but realized the
danger the buggy was careening over
the old road possibly half a mile from
where klondike had been thrown out when
the team whirled suddenly throwing mary
off into a patch of brush and headed back
in the general direction of the star x
cutting across country

  the cause of their sudden turn was a
lone horseman who had appeared suddenly
just a fewr yards ahead of them the

team was almost
into him when
it turned and
mary narrowly
missed being
thrown against
his horse the
horse whirled
wildly but he
reined i t back
dismounted
swiftly and ran
over to the girl

  with little difficulty he disentangled her
from the bush which had broken her fall
and placed her on the ground it was
dude wheeler cutting across country to-
ward the star x his face a mixture of
wonder and astonishment as he scratched
a match and looked down into the fright-
ened eyes of mary smith

  are yuh hurt he asked when he saw
her eyes open she did not say-merely
blinked at the match which burned dudes
fingers before he dropped it

  i-i dont think im hurt-much she
said as he scratched another match she
managed to sit up and he braced her with
one arm i guess im-im badly
shaken she admitted

  yeah ill bet you are but how did
yuh happen to be up here all alone with a
runaway team

 why i dont know exactly the
driver fell off you see

 yeah i see- that much dude
the loot of the lazy a



wheeler was lighting several matches so
he might get a better look at this girl

  who was the driver he asked mary
shook her head i dont know i just
came in on the train tonight you see

  in on the train echoed dude he
looked closer at her say are you miss
ault

  why-er-yes said mary turning her
eyes away

  the matches burned out and dude did
not light another

  i see he said slowly he got to his
feet and stood there gazing across the
hills yore a long ways from the lazy
a he said i dunno what-i wonder-
that was a lazy a team you dont
know who the driver was 

  no i have no idea who he was they
just put me in the buggy and the team ran
away

  i see im jack wheeler miss ault
folks call me dude 

  oh what a queer name

  we own the star x outfit

  isnt that nice i-i think ive hurt
my ankle mr wheeler

  i reckon you got off lucky if thats all
he helped her to her feet but she was
unable to walk

  i dunno said dude slowly its a
long ways to the lazy a i hadnt ought
to take yuh to the star x but its the
nearest place can yuh stand alone until
i get my bronc 

  mary clung to the brush while he led
his horse up to her

  you cant straddle no horse in that
skirt he told her

  no i suppose not admitted mary
what will we do

  and if i set yuh sideways on that sad-
dle and got on behind yuh wed probly
both get throwed off because that bronc
aint broke to pack double i reckon
theres just one thing to do

  he swung her up in his arms lifted her
to the saddle and got up with her lifting
her in his arms as he got into the saddle

  but you cant carry me in your arms
she protested

  this is all the evidence in the world
against yore idea he said as he rode off
through the hills if you can stand it i
shore can miss ill try and not hurt yore
ankle

klondike evans had landed just

off the road and just hard enough
to daze him for a minute or more
when he recovered sufficiently to realize
o

what had happened the team was far
away too far for him to even hear it he
was walking circles in the road when
buck wing joe chevrier and heinie mor-
iarity came galloping up the road leading
klondikes horse they drew up and con-
sidered klondike who was still half
speechless from hitting the ground so hard

  what in hell happened panted buck
wheres the team

  gone klondike puffed heavily and
flapped his arms helplessly th-throwed
me out line busted i dunno what hap-
pened next

  my gawd blurted heinie piously
shell be kilt

  already killed ill betcha exploded
buck git on yore bronc klondike
weve got to head em off

  head em off klondike lurched to
his horse and climbed into the saddle
head nothin theyre miles away and
goin strong i couldnt even check em
but no one was listening to him they
were spurring ahead as fast as their horses
could run

  watch for her along the road yelled
buck

  their horses never slackened their run
until they reached the big gate of the star
x where they found the buggy almost
wrapped around one of the gate-posts it
was the end of the road inside the yard
were the two horses one had lost all
its harness except the collar and limped
badly the other seemed to be all right

  the boys dropped off their horses cold
sober now and searched all around but
there was no sign of the girl sadly they
mounted and rode back toward town going
slowly searching both sides of the road
carefully afraid of finding the girl dead

  theyll hang us wailed klondike
ill betcha they will

  you get bout feefty shot in de hin-
side and you not scare from hang de-
clared joe who rode standing up in his
stirrups shes sure kill hall de joy for
you

  that was a fool thing to do com-
plained buck	

  this is a nice time to think about it re-
torted klondike it sounded good when
we was drunk anyway it was yore idea
buck

  originally klondike you was the
one that suggested ridin a circle and corn-
in back to the depot yuh remember don t
lay it all onto me	

  she was a danged pretty girl toofj
said klondike i got a good look at her


short stories

  sure and pulled all on one line

  aw let up on him buck said heinie
were all to blame dude will fire all of

us for this anyway so we might as well go
to town get drunk and take our medicine
if there ever was four bigger fools id
like to see what they look like

cultus collins walked from
the depot and engaged a room at the
oreana hotel after which he went
to the oreana saloon the sheriff and
miles lane were at the bar talking with
the bartender who was explaining the ar-
gument between the lazy a and the star
x they nodded to cultus who sat
down at a table and picked up a news-
paper

  i wasnt here to see the fun laughed
lane lucky that no one was hurt ex-
cept joe chevrier those few shot prob-
ably wont hurt him much do you lenow
if miss ault came in tonight

  i think so said the sheriff idaho
was there to meet her and i saw his outfit
go out of town on the run just got a
flash of the buggy and i think the girl
was in it idaho was drivin a half broke
team

  joe chevrier said he had been stung by
forty bees laughed the bartender he
didnt get much sympathy

  lane turned to cultus have a drink
with us stranger

  cultus dropped the paper and came up to
the bar

  my name is jones he said jones
of oklahoma

  mine is lane the lawyer introduced
cultus to the rest did you come in on

while back said the sheriit

  cultus squinted at his glass he had a
letter of introduction to a dead man it
seemed

  she inherited the lazy a ranch of-
fered the sheriff

  she didnt say anythin about it said
cultus thoughtfully a nice sort of a
girl it seemed to me

  shell be rich the sheriff backed
against the bar holding his glass that
lazy a is worth a nunt of monev
cattle asked cuitus

  gold the old man could have sold

out for a million but he hated holes in

ground que

  lanes question was interrupted by the
entrance of idaho breen he was hat
less a smear of blood across his mouth
and a livid scratch across over his righ
eye he spat angrily and lurched again
the bar

  give me a drink he snorted here
gimme that bottle

  idaho grasped the bottle and took a
heavy swig so heavy that the bartendei
gasped it was probably the biggest drin
ever taken in the oreana idaho slammed
the lxrttle back on the bar wiped the back
of his hand across his lips and tried tfl
blink the tears out of his eyes

  thats wliat id call a snifter observe
the sheriff

  sa-a-ay idaho pounded on the bat
with both bands as though to give fore
to his statement a-a-a-ahem-m-m-m j
was assaulted by several men a while ago
they hog-tied me in a dirty blanket and
left me out back of the depot the agenf
happened to find me my teams gone-
the girls gone

  you was exclaimed the sheriff
whatcha know-say i seen yore buggy
team go up the street just after the train
came in

  my buggy team choked idaho are
yuh sure

  yeah it was goin kinda fast but im
sure i seen a woman in it idaho

  yuh did eh idaho struck the top
of the bar with his fist it was that
damn star x outfit  they laid for me
and stole the girl they never left town
who was the girl they stole asked
cultus idaho glared at him wrho are
you

  this is jones of oklahoma said the
sheriff mr jones this is mr breen
foreman of the lazy a

  the girl they stole said idaho not
offering cultus his hand was the new
owner of the lazy a outfit

                                                            
the loot of the lazy a



  the girl we spoke about said the
sheriff the one that came in on the
rain with you

  oh yeah-that one

  was you there asked idaho quickly
didja see her git off the train who
net her eh whatd they look like
cultus grinned widely i dunno it
was kinda dark and i didnt pay much at-
rention

  it has been over an hour since the
rain came in said lane looking at his

watch have you-

  i have rasped idaho with a dirty
blanket over my head and part of it in
ny mouth i thought i was goin to have

o	stay all night

  just why would the star x steal that
ijirl asked cultus

  because they hate the lazy a  snorted
idaho we had a regular battle in the
street tonight nobody got killed i sup-
pose both sides were too drunk to shoot
straight theyd do anythin-them dirty
zoyotes im goin out to the star x and
get that girl

  think about it a while advised the
sheriff them boys wont eat her in
spite of yore opinion of the star x they
aint cannibals they was all drunk
idaho and their idea of a good joke would
je to steal the owner of the lazy a
dirty cow-thieves idaho was very
mad indeed

  thats a killin statement said the
sheriff dont let dude wheeler hear
yuh say it

  bad medicine asked cultus

  bad enough to resent a statement like
that

  you shouldnt say things like that
idaho said lane

  well by god i found fifty-three lazy

-a cow-hides in-

  we know that interrupted the sheriff
idaho reached for the bottle and took
another drink as a cowboy came in he
was from one of the small ranches south
f oreana he nodded pleasantly to
everyone

i was wonderin if any of the lazy a
gang were in town he grinned the
star x outfit are down in the rawhide
down in the rawhide asked idaho
how long have they been down there
well i dunno i heard the bartender
ell em that the lazy a thought theyd
un em out of town and the star x boys
aid they hadnt never left town

  idaho glared thoughtfully the taste
   

of the blanket was in his mouth and he
spat disgustedly

  did the agent see the girl get off the
train asked lane

  idaho shook his head he said he
didnt

  i reckon that jones of oklahoma is the
only one thats sure she ever came ob-
served the sheriff

  i saw a girl get off corrected cultus

  miles lane cleared his throat softly if
i were in your place idaho id go home
and sleep on it i dont think that girl is
in any danger of being hurt and you can t
do a thing tonight

  thats good advice nodded the sheriff
tomorrow mornin if the girl aint
showed up ill go with yuh to the star x

  yeah and ill take my whole gang
flared idaho ive got to hire a horse to
ride home on he stamped out of the
saloon and they heard him going down the
rickety sidewalk heading for the livery
stable

  cultus went back to the hotel puzzling
over what had become of mary he could
have described the two men who met her
at the train but decided not to he could
identify buck wing and klondike evans
any time and cultus wanted to know more
of things before he told anybody what he
knew

dude wheeler saw the wreck
of the lazy a buggy when he
rode through the gate with mary
in his arms in the dim starlight he could
see the two horses down near a corral so
he decided that the runaway team had cut
back to the road which they had followed to
the ranch gate

  he drew up at the porch of the ranch-
house and dismounted still carrying mary
in his arms

  your arms must be paralyzed she
said

  not exactly he laughed yore not
as light as yuh was when i first picked yuh
up hows the ankle feelin 

  why it seems numb but there is little
pain

  thats good he picked her up and
they went in the house

  the star x living-room was a commodi-
ous place rough finished with a huge fire-
place on one side the floor was strewn
with navajo rugs and many of the chair-
seats and backs were of cow-hide untan-
ned it was a typical mans abode at
one side of the front door was a gun-rack
	short

filled with rifles loose cartridges a
heavy colt revolver coil of spot-cord rope
packages of tobacco and some dog-eared
magazines were scattered over the rough
table top in the center of the room

   on the floor in front of the fireplace was
the skin of a grizzly bear while over the
mantle was a huge elk head with magni-
ficent antlers mary gazed around the
room after dude had placed her in their

easiest chair

  ill get some
hot water said
dude mebbe

s	o m e liniment
will help it out
you take it easy
and ill fix yuh
up fine

  mary watched
the tall straight-
backed cowboy
leave the room and sank back in her chair
with a sigh wondering what would happen
next her life had been adventurous in-
deed since she had met cultus collins
she had no idea just what she was to do in
oreana city thinking it over calmly was
impossible for her she was an impostor
and whether she could carry out the decep-
tion remained to be seen

  someone had entered the room behind
her and she turned to see eph wheeler
clad in an old red undershirt overalls and
a pair of mismated woolen socks the
old mans sparse hair was standing straight
up and his face appeared very thin in the
lamplight he squinted closely at her
glanced toward the kitchen where dude
was noisily poking wood in the stove and
then came a little closer to her

  just who might you be he asked cu-
riously i thought i must be dreamin
when i heard a womans voice out here

   am mary ault said mary bravely

i he old mans mouth opened but he did

not speak he rubbed his right hip with

u i nv elbow frowned at the lamp
shifted his feet

  mind sayin that again he asked

  mary repeated the name the old man
        fde cae in frm the kitchen
        ather and topped short

  trnr wake yuh up dad he asked

 i he old man did not reply he was too
interested in mary

  this js miss ault said dude

pick her uprat she said- whered 
dude explained about the runaway and
how he had found mary he was unable

stories

 to tell who had been driving the team and
 mary did not know

   its a lazy a rig said dude blue
 buggy with red wheels its wrapped
 around one of our gate-posts the horses
 are down by the corral i cant imagine
 what a lazy a rig would be doin out
 here

   my suitcase was in it said mary dude
 walked out and came back in a few mo-
 ments carrying the suitcase which was
 none the worse for the runaway the old
 man sat down and watched mary while
 she soaked her swollen ankle in hot water

  so jud ault was yore uncle eh he
 remarked know him

   no said mary she hadnt the slight-
 est idea who jud ault was

   he was a dirty old pup

  mary flinched she was evidently no
 related to a saint

   he turned his own daughter out con-
 tinued the old man but he was a dirty
 old pup long before that

   dad i dont reckon she cares to know
 all this said dude softly

  well she ought to anyway she
might as well hear it from me cause shei
goin to hear it sooner or later

   that liniment will take a lot of the sore-
 ness out said dude ill soak a ban-
 dage and-

   it seems to me yore takin a lot of
 pains with an ault said the old man
 dude flushed but did not reply

   been packin a winchester for em for
 years now yore wrappin up their ankles

   mary laughed lecause she did not real-
 ize how serious had been the hatred le-
 tween the two ranches

   what is a winchester she asked

  a gun said dude his hand trem-
 bled slightly and he spilled a little of the
 liniment

   do all men carry guns out here she
 asked dude looked up at her his eyes
 serious

   most of em do

  tell me about jud ault turning his
 daughter out

  its true dude did not look up at
 her she married a gambler some say
 he was also a lawyer but he didnt practice
 law here old jud ault wouldnt speak
 to her again she lives in oreana city
 with her little boy

   and he didnt leave her anything when
 he died 

   a dollar

   and the ranch is worth a million they
 ay growled the old man

 ucky

 i-i didnt know much about it fal-
 ered mary

 lane sent for yuh i reckon he made
 ut jud aults will

 yes said mary because she didnt
 enow what else to say

 dude finished bandaging the ankle and
 ook the water back to the kitchen

 are you thinkin of stayin here to-
 light asked the old man

 why i-i dont know said mary

 i guess youll go back to town

 dude came back and the old man turned
 co him yuh better harness up the team
 and take her back to the hotel dude
 they looked at each other for several
 moments

 that might be the best thing to do
 said dude slowly then ill hitch up the

 team

 he went out softly closing the door be-
 hind him mary curled up on the big
 chair her chin in her hand she did not
 like the old man who filled his pipe and
 smoked noisily

 youll sell the lazy a wont yuh he
 asked not unkindly

 mary shook her head im sure i dont
 know mr wheeler

 runnin a cow-ranch aint no womans
 job he sucked heavily on his pipe of
 course you might marry a cow-man

 i hadnt thought of that

 yore a queer sort of a girl thats
 about all most girls think about

 do you know much about girls
 hmph well dont they

 do they

 eph wheeler threw his pipe on the ta-
 ble with a grunt of disgust im glad
 yore goin back to town i hate an argu-
 ment

 and you start them yourself

 i do not the old man drew himself
 up angrily his eyes flashing i never-
 say i dunno what this is all about i wish
 dude would hurry with that team you
 make me mad aults always made me
 mad you remind me of jud ault

 mary laughed openly at him and he
 s alked from the room swearing under
 his breath he did not put in an appear-
 ance when dude carried her out to the
 buggy and dude did not mention him until
 they were well on their way to oreana city

 the moon was up now and the hills
 were bathed in a silver glow blue in the
 depths and silver where the moonlight
 brushed the ridges a mystic fairyland



where the moon and stars came down close
to the world mary leaned back in the
buggy seat and looked at a world she had
never seen before

oh isnt it beautiful she said simply
yesm it is i never get tired of these
hills at night the rough edges are all

gone lotsa
nights i just ride
into the hills
ride away back
on the ridges
its like goin
away from the
rest of the
world

  im sorry
dad talked like
he did but hes
old and he hates the lazy a theres 
women at the star x pretty soon our
four cowpunchers will be driftin home
from town loaded to the gills with liquor
-and it might not be a nice place for a
lady-the star x ranch theyre a rough
lot youll be better off at the hotel i
put yore suitcase in the back of the buggy
its a wonder it didnt get all smashed
and you too

  yes thats true im sorry to have put
you to all this trouble mr wheeler i
just cant imagine what would have hap-
pened to me if you hadnt met that run-
away

  well it was kinda lucky about a
hundred yards beyond where you was
throwed out theres a deep washout i
reckon things would a gone to smash in
there its about thirty feet across-and
there aint no road

  you mean a deep rut

  yuh might call it a rut maam its
about twenty feet deep

  oh mary shuddered im glad i
met you

  well so am i said dude softly and
it wasnt any trouble so yuh dont need to
thank me

  but you hate the ault family you

probly go out to the lazy a tomorrow
they drove up to the hotel ducle car-
ried her suitcase in and mary was able
to walk slowly the proprietor was read-
ing by the light of a smoky old oil lamp
he stared over his glasses at mary

ley said dude shes only goin to be

yes maam looks like old jud eh

  the old man bent double over his stock
joke grabbed the lamp in one hand the
suitcase in the other and led the way down
a narrow hall

  ill put ye in the presidents sweet
he chuckled its the only one that the
wash-bowl aint cracked

  dude watched them turn into a room
and went outside there was plenty of
noise in the oreana so he went over
klondike buck heinie and joe were de-
cidedly drunk they goggled at him owl-
ishly sobering a trifle it was rather un-
usual for dude to come to town at that
time of night buck invited him to have
a drink but he declined

buck by the arm

  then its all right heres happy days
gents

it was early the following morning
when idaho breen and his three cow-
boys rode in to oreana city each
man carried a rifle in a scabbard and an ex-
tra belt of cartridges the lazy a was
prepared for war cleve sears the pudgy
sheriff sighed mournfully when he saw
them he wanted to be fair with both
sides even if joe chevrier did try to kill
him the evening previous idaho briskly
stated his intentions of going out to the
star x and demanding the girl and an ex-
planation

  and you better come along cleve he
said its yore place to see that we get a
square deal

  no-o-up the sheriff shook his head
in the first place yuh dont know they
took her last night yore outfit staged a
battle with the star x which wasnt no-
ways decisive if yuh go out there all
the loot of the lazy a



heeled for a scrap-youll git it idaho
and im not goin to back yore play and
i jist want yuh to know that the law aint
back yuh if yuh kill some of the star x
set to kill somebody thats agin the
law if you go out there and git some of
yore men killed yuh aint got no law to
back yuh if yuh kill some of the star x
all hell cant save yuh from bein tried for
murder better do quite a lot of thinkin
about it idaho

  it was a long speech for cleve sears to
make and it left him gasping for breath
it also left idaho breathless

  are you backin the star x de-
manded idaho you went and used a
shotgun  joe chevrier last night and

now yuh want to back their-

  im not backin anybody chevrier
tried to kill one of us mebbe both but
that was last night yore goin out there
to pick a fight well go ahead but re-
member what i told yuh

  but i want to find the girl wailed
idaho im not lookin for a war cleve
that girl was stolen dontcha see why
ive got a charge of horse-stealin i can
put agin the man who took my team
there aint no law against killin a horse-
thief

  aint never been no law agin it said
the sheriff slowly at least when yore
sure youve got the right man

  well i dont think yore playin square
cleve

  idaho joined his men in front of the
rawhide saloon where they sat down to
debate over their next move the sheriff
went on up to the hotel dining-room where
he usually ate his meals he was just in
the act of making an attack on a platter of
ham and eggs when mary limped into the
room and sat down

  cleve sears was a bachelor but not
feminine-proof he stared at mary and
found it difficult to concentrate on break-
fast she paid no attention to him but
ordered her breakfast from the hotel pro-
prietor who asked her how her laig was
this morning

  much better thank you she smiled

  dont mention it miss ault want
yer aigs lookin up or blind

  i dont think i know what you mean
leave em as they lay or turned over
maam 

  oh as they lay laughed mary the
man shuffled away to the kitchen the
sheriffs breakfast was unfinished but he
hurried outside and crossed the street to
where idaho and his men were still debat-
ing what to do

  if yore lookin for a miss ault-shes
eatin breakfast in the hotel announced
the sheriff

  idaho blinked rapidly over there
huh  howd she git there

  i didnt ask her said the sheriff coldly
i suppose she stayed there last night
persnally i think you was drunk and
didnt meet the train

  no such a damn thing i tell yuh-
oh well i dont care wrhat you think
they all filed over to the hotel and on
the way they saw miles lane coming down
the street he was greatly surprised at
the news and anxious to see her the
four cowboys stayed in the hotel lobby
while the sheriff idaho and lane went into
the dining-room

  miles lane lost no time in introducing
himself and also introduced idaho breen
and the sheriff mary had finished her
breakfast so lane asked her to go to his
office with him and idaho

  youve got yore credentials aint yuh
asked idaho mary produced the letter
which lane glanced through nodding
quickly he turned to the sheriff

  cleve i wish youd get old judge mears
and bring him to my office we dont ex-
actly need him but id like to have him
there when we read the will

  the sheriff turned away and lane led
the way to his office ignoring the three
cowpunchers who were anxious to meet
the girl once inside the office lane
closed the door and motioned mary to a
seat idaho lounged against the closed
door looking speculatively at mary who
tried to appear at ease

  this letter says to keep you away from




short stories

 liquor said lane seriously maybe you

 understand that

    yes said mary softly

    ill say that loring was a good picker

 lane laughed softly how much did he
 tell you about this deal

   not very much mary glanced at the

floor	   

   all right youd fool anybody my
 dear i was afraid loring might send a
 hard-boiled female

    yuh cant tell by the label laughed
 idaho

   thats true lane moved closer to
 mary and lowered his voice i dont
 know how much loring told you but you
 dont need to know very much what
 you dont know wont hurt you just do as
 we say and youll get your money is
 that plain

 mary nodded not trusting her voice
 all right well read that will as soon
 as the men get here and then youll go out
 to the lazy a and remember-you are
 mary ault as long as you are here you
 plav square with us and youll get your
 profit

and if she dont- idaho breen

 hesitated

 we wont discuss such a remote possi-
 bility idaho now lane became quizzi-
 cal will you please tell us what happened
 to you last night 

 i-i hardly know faltered mary a
 man met me at the train put me in a buggy
 and the team ran away another man
 found me after i was thrown out and
 brought me to the hotel i hurt my ankle
 but it is much better this morning

would you know these men if you
seen em asked idaho

 mary shook her head quickly it was
 quite dark you see

 hear any names

 no-except the man who brought me
 in his name was wheeler

 dude wheeler eh idaho laughed
 harshly

    i hat was his name he was very nice

to me	j

 idaho laughed but dropped the subject
 the sheriff and old judge mears
 strict judge were coming in the

 lazy a crowded in and
 listened to miles lane read the will of jud

 vruh the exception of one
 dollar the entire lazy a property was left

 to his niece mary ault his brothers only
 child-an orphan	

    the old judge nodded over the legality
 of the instrument and the reading was

over the will had been witnessed by
idaho breen and pie ide

   as they came from the office cultus col-
lins met them near the door he nodded
pleasantly to everyone idaho turned to
pie ide and asked him to go over to tlie
livery stable and secure a rig to take mary
out to the ranch

  cultus moved in close to idaho id
like to speak to you on a little business
matter he said

  idaho squinted narrowly at cultus as
they moved down the street a short ways
away from the crowd cultus drew out
the letter he had brought to jud ault and
let idaho read it

   now i dont know what its all about
confessed cultus it kinda seems to me
that ive arrived too late but mebbe you
know what the old man wanted done
idahos eyes hardened slightly i
dunno just what-oh yeah he looked
at cultus a half smile on his lips i
reckon i know what it was about yuh
see weve been losin a lot of cattle jist
a while ago i found a lot of lazy a hides
in a prospect hole about three miles from
our ranch somebody has been killin our
stock and the old man was worried about
it theres been bad blood between our
outfit and the star x for years and that
bothered him too if you can clean up

   a  this cattle
   stealin vore
   a wonder do
   yuh think yuh
   can 

     cultus smil-
  ed widely i
  dunno ill
  try

   fine

	idaho fairly

v	beamed

x	yuh better

give me a job on the lazy a suggested
cultus it would kinda mask my real
work dont yuh see

  well idaho rubbed his chin thought-
fully yeah i can you aint got no
horse here have -uh no say you git
yore stuff out here and put it in the buggy
and you can drive miss ault out to the
ranch well be along with yuh

  all right but i aint got nothin to
fake along mebbe i better buy a couple
of shirts anyway ill get along

     eah git what yuh need ide will be
here with the buggy in a few minutes

 cultus nodded and went to the new
york store while idaho went back and

                                                         
the loot of the lazy a

 irew miles aside showing him the tele-
ram he had which was sent to jud ault
then he told miles about the letter of in-
roduction cultus had from the secretary
t the cattlemens association and of how
le was going to keep cultus out at the lazy
 to hunt rustlers

  his name is jones isnt it asked
lane

  thats the name he gave last night
the letter he had didnt mention any
names but jones or not jones hell hunt
rustlers to his hearts content and ill
have him where i can watch him all the
time

  lane laughed softly its working out
fine

  better than that miles how do yuh
like our heiress

  better than i thought i would she
sure tits the part why youd almost take
her for a decent girl

  almost grinned idaho loring
knew what we needed the only thing
that worries me is that loring is in a posi-
tion to demand more money he knows
too much

  let him try anything like that and ill
send him to the penitentiary for life
growled lane here comes the rig
they helped mary into the buggy while
one of the boys got her suitcase from the
hotel she gave lane the check for the
trunk and idaho promised to send a
wagon after it cultus came from the
store carrying a bundle and idaho mo-
tioned for him to take the lines lane
hastened to introduce mary and cultus
smiled

  i met miss ault on the train he said
i didnt know who she was at that

time

  well lead the way said idaho head
straight out of town and take the road that
leads to the left

  cultus nodded and drove slowly up the
street while the men crossed the street
and mounted their horses

  hang onto yore nerve cautioned cul-
tus im goin to stay at the lazy a and
hunt rustlers i had to show my hand in
order to keep an eye on you mary eliza-
beth this is a game and well play it to-
gether but dont let anybody know be-
cause its a dangerous pastime theyre
goin to ride in close now so be careful
what yuh say to me

  mary nodded and looked straight ahead
as the cowboys spurred in close to them

  yore name is jones aint it said
idaho leaning from his saddle

       

   cultus nodded quickly bill jones to
 be exact

  from oklahoma

 i thats the place

   uh-huh idaho straightened in his sad-
 dle and there was a smile on his lips as
 he looked straight ahead perhaps he
 didnt know it but there was also a smile
 on the lips of jones of oklahoma too and
 he was also looking straight ahead

old jud ault had load little
pride in appearances and as far as
the lazy a was concerned he was
content to let it run down the old ranch-
house was half adobe two stories a very
livable place but not much to look at a
wide veranda extended the width of the
front on the ground level with the old
flagged floor still intact the big living-
room was much the same as that of the
star x which was of decidedly masculine
flavor

   old wang lung a wizen-faced old ce-
 lestial presided over the culinary end of
 the lazy a he had been with the lazy
 a for many years and was known as
 hop for no reason at all he had ac-
 cepted both mary and cultus without com-
 ment he was jealous of his kitchen and
 woe to anyone who intruded

   idaho breen had told the boys confiden-
 tially that bill jones of oklahoma was an
 association detective cowboys as a rule
 do not care much for a range detective and
 this rangy homely specimen with the sol-
 emn visage rather amused them

   pie ide tried to frame up some practi-
 cal jokes to play on the detective but dis-
 carded each one shortly after its inception

   i jist cant do it he confided to
 omaha as they sat on the top pole of the
 corral together i git a swell idea for a
 joke on him and then i cant seem to pull
 it off he looks at me with them funny
 eyes and i kinda-you know how the hair
 raises up on the back of a dog when its
 scared thats the way i kinda crinkle
 well you aint scared of him are yuh
 omaha smoothed his mustache and stared
 at pie ide the tall cowboy shook his
 head

   it aint exactly bein scared omaha
 but somethin tells me that he knows all
 about that joke even when i think of a
 new idea he looks at me just as though he
 knowed what i was thinkin about and that
 the joke was as old as the hills

   aw he aint so smart said omaha
 hes been here a week and he aint done
 nothin-much


short

   i know he was over to that pros-
pect hole where idaho found them cow-
hides  asked him what he thought of
em and he jist looks at me kinda funny
and says  think the cows that wore all
them hides are dead

   omaha snorted he did eh gawd
he sure is a detective

   idaho dont think much of him said
 pie i heard him ask jones the other day
 how long he figured the lazy a was goin
 to pay him a salary if he didnt do some
 detectin

   what did he say pie

   he said he was doin his best idaho
asks him how he goes about it to find a rust-
ler and he says he usually tries to put
himself in the place of the rustler i
dunno what he meant and i dont think
idaho did but idaho says well have yuh
done it in this case jones says he had
but it didnt seem to work out idaho
asks him what he intends to do now and
jones says well mebbe ill put myself
in the cows place and kinda work it out
from that angle 

   i think jones is a plain damn fool
said omaha

    i think said pie slowly that that is
 jist what jones of oklahoma wants us to
 	think omaha

the association
aint in the habit

	f sendin fools
on a job of this
kind

thasso huh

	never seen a
cow-detective that
had sense enough

to pour sand out of a boot

  allasame im glad im pure grinned
 pie he lifted his head and squinted to-
 ward the main gate here comes miles
 lane do yuh know omaha im begin-
 nm to suspect that hes stuck on our new
 boss

dangedp fool growled omaha pie
laughed softly lotsa fools around here

	feetp to me even cleve sears our
estimable sheriff aint losin no chances
to come out here

 all of which was very true much to the

teisterwho met mies

a

ses m  n ajelter directed  mary

 ault idaho looked closely at it put it in
 his pocket and looked over the rest of the

stories

mail the front door was closed behind

them

  that letter was mailed in oreana city
observed lane idaho nodded and walked
to the far end of die veranda followed by
the lawyer idaho took out the letter and

tore open the flap it read

my dear miss ault

  by this time you probably realize that
there is little friendship lost between your
ranch and mine but after all there is no
reason why zee cannot be friends vrou
understand that  cant very zvcll come to
see you at the lacy a and i do want to see
you again cant you meet me in town
just drop me a note and ill be waiting
there for you make it soon

                   sincerely yours

                dude jack wheeler

idaho snorted disgustedly and tore the
letter into shreds scattering them in the

breeze

   not going to give it to her eh queried
lane

   dont look like it does it

  suits me how is she

  all right sa-a-ay dude wheelers
got a lot of nerve id like to see him
moonin around here 

  lane laughed softly youve got to ex-
pect those things shes a pretty girl
idaho looked closely at lane you
aint lettin that bother you are yuh her
looks dont mean anythin to you do they 
lane flushed slightly not a bit
well said idaho softly they better
not miles ill be glad when everythin is
fixed up and shes out of here by god
i cant git any work out of three fool
punchers who insist on weaxin white col-
lars and takin baths

  how about jones of oklahoma
idaho grinned that poor fool i
wonder if the association was playing a
joke on the lazy a or if they jist wanted
to git rid of jones every day he saddles
his horse and goes ridin in the hills-
alone but he aint found out anythin
where does he ride asked lane
oh i dunno i dont pay much atten-
tion to him

  they sauntered back to the front door
and went into the house mary was
curled up on a couch reading an old mag-
azine but started to leave the room when
they came in she had grown to dislike
the oreana attorney

  dont go said lane youre always
running away it seems
tiie loot of the lazy a

  she wanted to go to town today of-
cred idaho but i told her wed get
inythin she wants

  sure we will nodded lane

  does that mean that im a prisoner
lere asked mary indignantly

  have it that way if yuh want to re-
jlied idaho this deal is almost settled
ind were not takin any chances on you

  but what harm would there be in going

o	town she asked

  youll stay here declared idaho
you can go when we tell yuh to go-and
hen we dont care where yuh go just so
yuh go a long ways from here youll be
well paid for the job and yore only instruc-
tions after yuh leave here is to forget that
yuh ever seen the place i reckon loring
explained that to yuh

  mary turned her attention to the maga-
zine glad to drop the subject lane and
idaho went outside and finished their con-
versation while mary stared out of the
window she had virtually been a pris-
oner since she arrived at the lazy a hop
served her meals to her in the living-room
keeping her away from the dining-room
and from any contact with the men

  she had had no chance to talk with cul-
tus breen had treated her respectfully
enough for which she was grateful but she
did want a few words with cultus idaho
breen took no chances on her and stayed
close to the ranch while miles lane han-
dled the legal end of the inheritance

  as yet she had been told nothing of
what they wanted except that she was
mary ault the new owner of the lazy a
she had been given the room formerly oc-
cupied by jud ault which had been
scrupulously cleaned by hop as far as
physical comforts were concerned she was
all right

  the lazy a had furnished cultus with
a horse and saddle and breen had told him
to do as he pleased cultus realized that
mary was more or less of a prisoner but
there was nothing he could do to relieve the
situation he also knew that breen was
little interested in the stolen cattle except
that he would like to make some trouble for
the star x

  that idaho breen and miles lane in-
tended to loot the lazy a was easy to see
cultus realized how easy it would be for
him to prove that mary smith was not
mary ault but it would be difficult to
prove that there was no mary ault it
would only serve to brand mary smith as
an impostor and him as her confederate

  cultus surmised that breen and lane in-

tended to merely use the girl as a tool to
get the ranch cheap the letters proved
that the girl who was shot in san francisco
was janice lee or at least she was not
mary ault after associating with the
three cowpunchers at the lazy a cultus
decided that they were not in the plot it
was evident that they believed as did
everyone else that mary ault was genuine
in fact there was no reason for anyone to
think otherwise

  on the same day that lane brought the
letter from dude wheeler cultus rode in
at the tumbledown cross arrow and met
badger and shifless hill the old man
was sitting on his little porch clad in a
sleeveless undershirt faded pair of over-
alls without boots or socks-his bare feet
resting on the porch-rail while he slumped
back in a rickety chair smoking his pipe

  he unbent enough to remove his pipe
from his mouth and to grunt a welcome
cultus dismounted tied his horse and sat
down on the steps as cultus rolled a

cigarette shif-
less came o u t
stooping a little
as he stepped
through the
doorway

  howdy he
said pleasantly
i didnt know
we had company
yore jones
aint yuh

  y e a h im
jones cultus got up and shook hands
with shifless

  somebody-i reckon it was the sheriff
-said who yuh was yore with the lazy
a aint yuh 

  im over there smiled cultus
damned outfit snorted the old man
shifless smiled

   dont like em eh queried cultus
   no why should i like em

  no reason i suppose cultus smiled
over his cigarette seems like a good out-
fit whats wrong with em 

  i reckon its all right since jud ault
died said shifless before the old man
could speak this girl cant be blamed
for what jud ault done mebbe shes
mighty fine

  shes a fine girl said cultus hows
things with you folks

  we cant kick smiled shifless

   as long as the other outfits raise pleniy
of calves-were doin well said the old
man at least thats what they say about
 

us shifless tried to stop him hut the
old man shook his head violently  w hat s
the difference they all say t

  shifless smiled grimly at cultus who
smoked slowly looking at the old man

  it just happens said shif less slowly
that mr jones is an association detective
sent here to try and find out who is stealin
lazy a cattle

  the old man jerked slightly and looked
at cultus his eyes blazing cultus re-
marked to himself how much the old man
did look like a gray old badger angry over
something

  so thats what yuh are eh he snarled
kinda lookin over the cross arrow are
yuh  well go ahead 

  cultus looked at shifless ignoring the
old man who told yuh that  he asked
miles lane the lawyer

  cultus nodded he had suspected this
he wondered if all the cattle outfits in the
oreana country didnt know what he was
doing

  are you a pretty good friend of lane
he asked

  shifless hesitated for a moment well
ive known him quite a long time jones
he didnt lie about yuh did he

  cultus shook his head slowly no he
told the truth-as far as he knew it hill
as far as he knew it

  even a lawyer dont know it all
well what in hell are yuh doin here
at my ranch  rasped the old man

  tryin to be friendly

  tryin to be-what

  friendly

  oh yeah and then see what yuh can
find out eh

  if you dont steal cattle youve got
nothin to fear said cultus slowly

  well thats nice of yuh

  shifless studied the tall homely cow-
boy there was a world of power in that
lean body he sat humped over on the
steps and his cotton shirt drawn tight
showed the ripple of his back and shoulder
muscles as he moved the slightest his
wide lean hands with the long fingers
the broad bony wrists bespoke vise-like
power

  i didn t come over here because of
what i ve heard said cultus slowly be-
cause i hardly ever believe what i hear
i m not deny in that i was sent here by
the association but it was because tud
ault wanted me to come

  but hes been dead quite a while
jones

short stories

it took quite a while to locate me and

they didnt know the old man was dead
now what in hell did that old crook
want of a detective demanded badger

hill

  i dont know confessed cultus he
didnt know either but he thought things
wasnt just right

  you bet they wasnt right said shif-
less hotly jud ault turned his daughter
out of his house because she married a man
he didnt like and after the man left
her without any support the old man
wouldnt help her

  shes a pretty nice sort of a girl i
hear said cultus he was looking at
shifless hill as he spoke he saw the
jaw of the big indolent-iooking cowboy
shut tightly and his wistful blue eyes
stared out across the hills

  yeah shes-nice said shifless
slowly the old man glanced at shifless
and at cultus and cultus saw an expres-
sion of amusement in the old mans eyes

  they say her husband is still support-
in her said cultus

  shifless nodded but did not speak
has he been here since he left his
wife

  no

  yes said the old man quickly i
saw him yuh dont need to argue with
me shifless said the old man when
shifless opened his mouth to speak he
turned to cultus i saw jack keene in
oreana city talkin to miles lane one
night shifless says i was mistaken but
i know what i see

  how long ago was this

  over a year ago

  a year ago last june said shifless
i think it was about the fifteenth of the
month weve argued about it enough
that i remember the date

  thej talked for a while about cattle con-
ditions but rustling was not mentioned
again old badger hill shook hands
with cultus when he left and asked him to
visit them again

  cultus had been to the prospect shaft
where idaho breen found the lazy a cow-
hides but there was no clue in a lot of
hides the animals had all been shot and
the hides showed that the cattle had been
killed at intervals for several months

  he rode back to oreana city and found
the sheriff talking to mrs keene in front
of his office the sheriff introduced them
mrs keene was carrying several packages
which cultus offered to take the little
boy accepted cultus at once when cultus

                                                      
the loot of the lazy a

untied at him and the three of them walked
lo mrs keenes home

  mrs keene was interested in mary ault
nd asked cultus about her cultus con-
essed that he could tell little about her
ultus carried the packages through the
ittle living-room to the kitchen and on
he way back he stopped to glance at a
holograph on the center table

  that is little jackies father said mrs
ceene cultus nodded thoughtfully as he
ioked down at the unmistakable features
f loring the san francisco lawyer who
ad been killed iu the cafe gun battle the
lan he had knocked into the muddy street
jack keene queried cultus

 faith keene nodded did you know
im she asked softly

 cultus shook his head and turned to-
-ard the door

 im mighty glad to have seen yuh
raam he said as he held out his hand

 it was kind of you to carry the pack-
ges for me she replied he shook hands
ravely with the little boj and went down

to the main
street wearing
h i s sombrero
pulled down
over h i s eyes
he was finding
out more than he
had expected

 jack keene
was the m a n
who was sending
the woman to
pose as the niece
of jud ault and
it was very evi-
dent to cultus that keene or loring as
e was known in san francisco was in
fie plot to loot the lazy a but keene
as dead and cultus did not think that
jlther lane or breen knew of the shoot-
t ig the girl janice lee was probably
ead or in a hospital and possibly she
id not know enough about the details of
fcie plot to ever let lane and breen know

i hat happened

as cultus sauntered up the crooked
reet miles lane rode in and took his
rse to the livery stable cultus leaned
ainst a post in front of the oreana sa-
on until lane went to his office and then
ossed the street

lane greeted him pleasantly and they
it down together in the office lane told
jm that he had just returned from the
pzy a
i



  i was just talkin to mrs keene said
cultus

  a nice girl said lane briskly too
bad she lost out on the lazy a possibly
jud ault was too severe but he hated
jack keene and- oh well it was his
business i suppose what have you
found out in regard to the missing cat-
tle

  not very much what do yuh know
about the cross arrow

  less than nothing-except hearsay i
know the hill family to speak to them
thev havent a good reputation

  and the star x

  youve heard about the feud

  sure they staged a battle in the
street here the night i came breen talks
about em killin lazy a stock and all that
but i cant quite swallow it lane the
star x is as big as the lazy a and they
dont need to kill lazy a cattle

  lane looked up quickly have you
been at the star x

  i was out there yesterday and had a
talk with the wheelers

 and they knew you were from the
lazy a

  they knew i was from the associa-
tion corrected cultus

  lane smiled crookedly that infor-
mation wont help you any jones

  mebbe not smiled cultus yuh see
i wasnt the one that told em

 no who do you suppose-

  they say you did lane

  that i told them why that is pre-
posterous jones

 and old man hill-

  did he say i told him

  shifless did

  pshaw lane colored tried to swal-
low failed i dont know why they
would say such a thing jones

  nor you said cultus softly un-
less yore tryin to get me killed off
why the idea is ridiculous jones i
havent any interest in your affairs except
as they affect the lazy a i have been at-
torney for ault for years and naturally
i am interested in anything affecting the
lazy a ranch idaho breen wants you to
clean up this rustling why id be the
last person on earth to seek to injure you
jones

  well thats fine of yuh drawled cul-
tus he shook hands with lane and saun-
tered out dude wheeler was just going
into the post office and waved a salute to
cultus who walked up and met him 
i want to ask yuh somethin jones


short stories

said dude a bashful grin on his face
they moved close to the door of the post-
office yuh know i met miss vuftthe

said dude she s

go ahead

night she came in
sure a nice girl

  cultus grinned widely

cowboy	  

  im glad yuh understand sighed
dude its thisaway jones i aint
seen her since that night and yuh see i
cant very well go out there to the lazy a
i wrote her a letter and posted it here this
mornin i just found out that miles lane
took the lazy a mail out to the ranch to-
day

  and miles lane dude hesitated
hes dressin up to go out there yuh
see i dont trust him and im wonder-

m

  if he delivered the letter eh

  yuh might put it thataway jones i
know him pretty well

  all right grinned cultus what
can i do for yuh

  will yuh hand her a note from me
yeah ill do it i aint seen her to
speak to for a long time but if its possi-
ble ill see that she gets it

  dude secured some paper and an enve-
lope and when cultus rode back to the
lazy a he carried the note to mary it
was almost supper time and the boys were
all at the ranch cultus went to the long
wash-bench just outside the kitchen door
and began washing while hop stood in the
kitchen door dangling a ladle in his hand

  hop do you happen to know a china-
boy in frisco whose name is wrang lee
asked cultus

 old hop smiled widely yessa-my
clousin he lun chop-suey lestlant

 cultus grinned and nodded his head
that s the feller hop wang lee good
friend of mine

  this was not true because cultus did
not know wang lee and only knew of a
popular chopsuey restaurant of that name
lut old hop beamed wang lee velly
hch-niy clousin

  	thats irne cultus mopped his face
with a towel as he moved in closer to the
uunaman wong lee my friend hop

sabe cousn must be my frien- you
  yessa

  good cultus took the envelope from
his pocket caught it in a fold of the towel
and handed it to hop

  that note is for miss ault hop no-
body must see

  the old celestial accepted the towel

slipped the envelope inside his shirt and
turned away without a word it was evi-
dent that mary received the note but her
reply was to cultus which was given to
cultus by old hop after they had finished
supper she wrote

  am virtually a prisoner tell mr
wheeler i will see him as soon as possible
would like to talk with you but breen says

i	am to talk with no one if hop unll
carry notes it will be of some help to us
they are treating me all right

  the note was unsigned the fact that
she was a prisoner was no news to cultus
and he knew dude wheeler was right in
suspecting that miles lane had not de-
livered the letter to mary cultus realized
that under the law it would require nearly
a year to probate the will of jud ault ad-
vertise for creditors and to follow out all
the legal phases of the instrument but he
also knew that while hardly ethical it
would be legal for an heir to sell out his
or her interests to anyone who was willing-
to take a chance on the legality of the willj
in question

  and if breen and miles lane intended
doing such a thing there was nothing he
could do to prevent it mary without the
advice or assistance of anyone would be
obliged to sign the name of mary ault to
a bill of sale to the lazy a of coursej
he could notify the authorities of fraud
possibly defeat the purpose of breen and

lane but only serve to throw the will
courts indefinitely-or until it n
proved that no mary ault existed

into

  bej

  cultus decided that there was nothing
for him to do except to wait until some-
thing happened that would give him a
chance to puzzle out a solution of the case
in the meantime he decided to keep work-
ing on the cattle
stealing end or
the case he had
a talk with ida-
ho breen about
the cattle thafl
night but the
lazy a foreman
did not seem in-
terested he
tried to lead
breen into a dis-
cussion of jack keene husband of faith
ault but idaho side-stepped the subject
so cultus dropped it and went to bed af-
ter deciding to visit welcome creek the
next day

                                                         
the loot of the lazy a



earlier that afternoon shifless
hill had ridden to oreana city and
gone to the depot he had sent a
fle to a san francisco gunmaker for some
pairs and it was due back he paid the
cpress charges and took the package out-
de where he sat down on the edge of the
nation platform and unwrapped the rifle
t had been encased in a light wooden box
nd packed tightly with newspapers
shifless tried the action found it fune-
on mg perfectly and began putting the
ipers back in the long narrow box when
is eyes happened to get a flash of a pic-
ired face on one of the wrinkled news-
apers quickly he spread it out emitting
grunt of wonderment

 the unmistakable features of jack
eene stared up at him along with the face
 a pretty girl beneath whose portrait was
le name janice lee but the name be-
eath keenes picture was j loring coll-
ecting the pen and ink scroll which joined
le two portraits was an artists concep-
on of the gun battle between two men
id behind one of them was a girl dressed

	a traveling suit

  the story told of a gun battle in a san
rancisco cafe in which j loring an at-
rney and speed evans alleged gangster
id dope peddler had killed each other
anice lee had been struck twice and had
ied twelve hours later without regaining
nsciousness it had little to say about
oring except that he was little known
cjtside the tenderloin

  shifless read it through twice the rifle
-ing across his lap there was no ques-
tion in his mind about this man being jack
teene he noted the date of the paper
urefully tore out the article and put it in
sis pocket

picking up the rifle and the box he
talked around the depot threw the box
a weed patch and went back to his horse
e rode back up the street to miles lanes
bice it was getting late but he found
fane there

 whats on your mind shifless
 ked lane when shifless placed his rifle
 the desk and drew out the clipping
 e oreana city attorney took the clip-
 g and stared at the picture of jack
 ene and as he read the story he
 rned to sway slightly and his eyes
 nked painfully

 he lifted a hand and wiped the tears
 om his eyes not tears of grief or re-
 jtse but tears like a man might get whose
 es had stared into a bright light for a
 lg time he did not speak although shif-

less knew he had read the article

  what do yuh know about that asked
shifless softly

  my god breathed lane hoarsely
jack keene dead

 well hed probly finish thataway said
shifless

  lane looked at shifless blankly what
did you say he asked

  i said hed probly finish thataway
oh-yes lane looked at the clipping
again shifless had torn it through leav-
ing the date-line at the top of the page
lane looked at this and glanced quickly at
a calendar on the wall

  weve got to keep faith from finding
it out miles said shifless softly we
cant let her know

  faith oh yes yes we must keep
it quiet shifless you wont tell anyone
will you i can trust you cant i

  well id be the last to tell her
drawled shifless heck i wouldnt
have her find it out-not now

  thats fine lane almost pawed for
shifless hand well keep it dark eh
dont let anybody know if one person
finds it out theyll all know it

  i wont tell shifless shook his head
nossir say miles jack must a been
pretty tough eh i wonder if that was his
girl probly was faith still thinks hes
all right shifless looked wistfully out
through the window still thinks hes all
right miles

  yes yes impatiently you never
can figure a woman shifless

nor anybody else softly jack
keene took a different name and left his

wife-

  i know how you feel shifless you
love faith keene no dont shake your
head maybe she thinks a lot of you ill
help you

  i dont need no help miles i asked
her the other day why she didnt get a di-
vorce from jack and she said he was still
supportin her and that she couldnt never
marry anybody as long as jack was alive
now jacks dead-and we cant tell her
still what difference does it make if

shed marry-

  no dont tell her lane grasped him
by the ann dont do it shifless any-
way it isnt for you to do dont you see
shed think you-you were trying to hurry
things  dont you see 

  yeah i see shifless nodded slowly
i reckon we better keep it dark for a
while well im headin home miles
hang onto that piece of paper wont yuh


short stories

  oh ill keep it safe shi hess good

nshifless mounted his horse and rode
out of town carrying the rifle in the crook
of his right arm while miles lane locked
his front door and flopped in his office
chair trying to gather his scattered senses
he studied the clipping again janice
lee that was the name on the note of
identification  it was evident that the girl
out at the lazy a was not janice lee
but who was she miles lanes brain
whirled did this association detective
jones of oklahoma have anything to do
with it he wondered where did this
girl come from and where did she get the
identification papers 

  jack keene alias j loring was the man
who wrote the note-and he was dead
lane wondered if this girl at the lazy a
had stolen the papers at the time of the
gun battle and if she did who was be-
hind her masquerade

  lane drew a big bottle from a desk
drawer and took a drink he left the bot-
tle uncorked and every few minutes he
would lower the contents perceptibly he
decided to go to the lazy a ranch and
show the clipping to idaho breen but the
quart bottle was empty when he got his
horse at the livery stable-and mr lane
was very drunk

  in fact he was so muddled from drink
that he took the wrong road out of oreana
city in the dark and when he sobered to
the extent that he cared to realize anything
he found that he was not on any road had
no sense of direction-and nothing to
drink so he just rode on and on won-
dering dully if the moon would ever come
up and show him some familiar landscape

  after a while he saw the silhouette of an
old building which he recognized as being

nililllillli t h c deserted
  stamp-mill and
  buildings o f
  the abandoned
  suicide mine
  it had not been
  worked for
  several years
  jim scott the
  original owner
  had sunk every
  cent he owned

housl say bd- hus himsf  thelhih

house-thus giving it a new name others
had tried m vain to make it pay and it
was finally abandoned

  lane did not realize that the night was

nearly over so he was not going to tak
any chances on getting lost as long a
he had the buildings of the old mine as
landmark he knew it would not be difficuj
in daylight to cut across the hills to th
lazy a

   he struck one of the old trails and ro
 up closer to the old shaft-house where h
 intended to dismount a cold breeze wa
 sweeping across the hills and miles lan
 not dressed too warmly needed shelter

   suddenly he saw the dull gleam of 
light shining through a crack in the ol
building and almost at the same install
he realized that he had ridden in beside
saddled horse he was still a little daze
from the liquor but instinct told him ths
something was not just right

   turning his horse around he rode slow
back clown the trail turned his horse ini
the shelter of a mesquite clump in- a dfl
wash and dismounted curiosity prompts
him to climb back up the trail again in
this time he circled to the opposite side i
the building he took plenty of time an
was particular about making unnccessat
noises

   he came in against the wall of the buiu
 ing and worked his way around to whei
 a broken board gave him a fairly good vid
 of the interior the machinery had a
 -been moved away but there still remaine
 the old framework of the hoist parts of th
 old tracks and the huge timbers where th
 hoisting engine had stood

   but miles lane was not interested in th
 details of the old building an old lai
 tern hung from a nail in the old hois
 frame and in its faint illumination laij
 could see the huge bulk of a man his sha
 dow dancing grotesquely on the walls a
 he skinned out the carcass of a steer whid
 was also suspended from the hoist-frami

   another whole beef all dres d hun
near him lane could recognize him no
it was shifless hill he was workin
swiftly his skinning knife flashing in th
yellow light lane licked his lips an
swallowed heavily he could see the lan
tern light flash on the cartridge-heads in hi
belt and against the wall near him stood
winchester rifle lane was unarmed an
he suddenly realized that it might not b
healthy for him in case shifless suspecte
his presence as though fascinated h
leaned against the building and watched th
big cowboy strip off the hide he did nc
realize tliat daylight was creeping over th
hills

   shifless anished skinning the animal
and threw the hide down the shaft lan
the loot of the lazy a



led to himself he had plenty of evi-
s to send shifless hill over the road

	long time-in case he needed to use

	shoved away from the wall realizing
it was daylight and crept away in the
tion of his horse he did not want
less hill to find him there

 he three lazy a cowboys were
a snoring trio when cultus left the
bunkhouse and went to the stable
e he saddled his horse it was still
 and cultus knew that hop would not
breakfast for another hour at least

	decided to postpone his morning meal
he reached welcome creek
jltus had never been to welcome
k but he knew it was not over fifteen
s east of the lazy a and that by trav-
 past where idaho breen had found
lazy a hides in the prospect hole he
d strike the wagon road which led
i oreana city to the welcome creek
ts

ultus mounted and rode away from the
it breen had given him a tall roan
ing which had plenty of speed and the
of the early morning gave it plenty of
dtion to go ahead the going was
y good and cultus let the roan pick
wn speed

ultus had never seen the old suicide
but had heard the boys speak about
he rode around the side of a hill and
e in view of the old buildings shortly
r daylight his horse made little noise
ae sandy soil and he was within a hun-
 yards of the old shaft-house when
jaw miles lane sneaking away from
de the building cultus horse was
ly masked by the brush so cultus
-kly dismounted he recognized lane
icdiately leading his horse to the
t he was able to watch the lawyer who
iked down a dry wash mounted his
re behind a mesquite clump and rode
tly away going toward the lazy a
thats kinda queer observed cultus
w just what was a lawyer doin there
his time in the mornin 

-ultus watched lane ride across a ridge
 disappear before moving on down to
 shaft-house he dropped his reins

i	walked boldly to the sagging old door
re he stepped inside and jerked to a
dstill when he found himself looking
the muzzle of a rifle in the hands of
less hill

 was still half dark in the old build-
shifting his eyes from the menacing

gun muzzle cultus could see the two beeves
hanging neither of the men spoke for
several moments thegun muzzle did not
waver

  well what about it asked shifless
ill a fiat voice

  a smile chased across cultus lips nd
he shook his head

  i reckon thats up to you shifless
yeah im wonderin how yuh guessed
id be here

  i didnt grinned cultus

  no kinda early in the mornin aint
it

  cultus nodded yeah i was on ray
way to welcome creek

  and jist stopped to look eh

  well no-o-o yuh see i didnt have
no idea of stoppin here until i seen our
friend the oreana city lawyer sneak away
from outside there grab his horse and fog
for the lazy a

  miles lane

   thats the feller

  cultus could see that the big cowboy was
puzzled

  what was miles lane doin here he
demanded

  search me but he was here put down
the gun shifless

  i suppose i might as well jones im
caught with the goods if lane is headed
for the lazy a hell probly bring back the
whole gang

  cultus walked past him and looked at
the beef threw the hides in the old
shaft he asked

  yeah

  intendin to pack the meat to welcome
creek tonight eh

  the big cowboy leaned against one of the
uprights and nodded gloomily i dunno
how yuh guessed it but yore right

  that wasnt hard to guess you killed
those animals that wore all them lazy a

hides-

  that breen found finished shifless
yeah i did

  wtelcome creek was the only possible
market i figured you couldnt sell all
that beef breen had an idea that the star
x was the ones that was killin off his
stock but the star x dont need to kill
beef

  ive been killin oft lazy a beef for
over a year said shifless slowly i
couldnt handle much at a time its quite
a job for one man dad wouldnt help
me he said i was a damn fool and i
sure was now what are yuh goin to do
about it


those

 how deep is this shaft	f

 two hundred feet there s big

slopes of course

  all right how could the lazy a find

hides is there any way to get
down there
not unless
they go down
on a rope
which they
wont do said
cultus
whered they
ever find a two
hundred foot
rope  lane
thinks you
dont know he saw yuh so well just heave
them two beeves down the shaft which
will destroy all the evidence what little
blood is scattered around wont convict
anybody cmon lets get busy

  whats yore game queried shifless
  helpin out a damn fool

 the lazy a was at breakfast when
miles lane rode in breen left the table
and met him at the front door

whats the matter with you asked
breen you look pretty tough miles
the lawyer took hold of breens sleeve
and drew him off the porch and around
the corner

  is jones and the girl still here he
asked

 the girl is jones has gone to welcome
creek whats the matter

  lane drew out the newspaper clipping
and showed it to breen

  theres whats the matter idaho jack
keene is dead look at the date-line on
that paper that girls name is janice
lee and shes dead

  idaho lifted his eyes from the paper
staring blankly at the lawyer but what
does it mean he whispered

  what does it mean  it means that this
girl is not janice lee that she is somebody
else rhis is not the girl jack keene sent
us weve been double-crossed idaho

in jones  bet jones knows that keene

shaft-house of the suicide mine

  lane got his horse and rode lack t
ward oreana city while breen went bac
to the dining-room the cowboys wei
rolling their after-breakfast cigarette
when breen called them outside

  you fellers saddle up and go to the ol
suicide mine he ordered lane juj

  the cowboys hurried after their hors
not that they disliked shifless hill b
that they desired action- they rode aws
with their rifles and idaho went back
the house where he found mary in
living-room

us of jones of oklahoma suddenly
turned and glared at mary who stood
ide the center table looking at him

 	mary sat down in a chair beside the ta-
  wondering what to do she was afraid

 i	breen from a window she had seen
 the cowboys ride
 away hop was in
 the kitchen wash-
 ing dishes but she
 knew she could ex-
 pect no help from

 rwhere breen laughed shortly

 i set still you act sensible and
 a those papers and well see about your
 lises-mary ault breen laughed
 paly mary ault and you tried to
 a me

 cultus and shifless rode away from the
 mine heading toward the cross arrow
 fless was still a little mystified as to
 cultus had helped him destroy the
 lence they had left nothing for the
 y a to find as evidence unless they
 fe willing to search the two hundred foot

level of the crumbling old shaft

  i reckon mr lane didnt lose any time
in tellin breen what he saw back there
observed cultus

  shifless nodded gloomily probiy
not jones i dont sabe what lane was
doin there at that time in the mornin

  i dont know shifless ive hear-
that you kinda think a lot of faith keene
shifless turned in his saddle you
heard it did yuh 

  thats nothin agin yuh cowboy why
dont yuh marry her

  plenty of reasons i reckon in the
first place i dunno if shed marry me if she
could and in the second place-shes still
got a husband

  well smiled cultus yuh can easy
find out the first part of it and in the sec-
ond place jist between me and you her
husband is dead

  shifless stared at cultus

  how do yuh know jones

  i happened to be there when he was
killed i didnt know it at the time but l
seen his picture later and it was the face
of a feller they called loring a cheap
lawyerin frisco

  shifless nodded quickly there was
two men killed-and a woman her name
was janice lee

  cultus leaned closer to him how do
you know that

  it did not take shifless long to explain
about finding it in the paper

  i took it to lane he said lane

was keenes friend and i thought-

  you took it to him last night cultus
jerked up his horse

  yeah

  good gosh exploded cultus and
lane has gone to meet idaho breen lis-
ten shifless you go to town if breen
or lane show up there with that girl-
mary ault-stop em no i cant tell yuh
why just stop em and then come out to
the lazy a

  cultus whirled his horse around drew
his hat down over his eyes and sent the
roan on a stiff gallop back toward the lazy
a he realized that the newspaper clip-
ping would prove to lane and breen that
mary smith was an impostor it was
something unforeseen and cultus knew
that breen would stop at nothing now to
get control of the lazy a

a nd about the time that cultus had
jk found out about the newspaper clip-
x jlping miles lane was riding back to
the lazy a with the papers for mary to
 

sign he had had them prepared for days
they were snake-tight and all they needed
was the signature of mary ault and his
own as notary public he had made the
imprint of his seal before he left the of-

 her signature would make idaho jim
breen owner of the lazy a estate and
idaho breen would take miles lane m as
a full partner in the holdings even the
partnership papers were all prepared lane
was very thorough in his crooked work

  he rode his lathering horse up to the
ranch-house and went in mary was sit-
ting beside the table her face very white
on a chair against the wall sat idaho breen
he hat been drinking from a bottle and
was just drunk enough to be alert

  got everythin ready he asked lane
nodded and spread the papers on the table
get the pen and ink idaho

  mary stared at the typewritten sheets
take a good look at em sister
laughed breen as he came with the pen and
ink and placed them on the table

  lane dipped the pen in ink and handed
it to her placing his finger on the ruled
line put your name right there just
write mary ault

  mary looked up at them her hand trem-
bling but that isnt my name

  nobody knows it better than we do
laughed breen write it out and well
take a chance on it you wasnt supposed
to come here yuh know

  suppose i refuse to sign mary shut
her lips and looked defiantly at breen
you cant make me sign

  tryin a holdup eh no good my
dear everybody knows you are the owner
of the lazy a and if yuh refuse to sign
well fake a signature

  and ill swear it isnt mine-and prove
it

  breens jaw tightened and he leaned
closer to mary no yuh wont you
wont prove anythin if youve got a lick
of sense youll sign that paper right now
mary took the pen and signed the name
of mary ault there was nothing else
tor her to do breen laughed softly as
lane handed him the paper and reached
for the bottle

t	easy  tha stuff advised

lane were not out of the woods yet
breen took a big drink and put the bot-

j illhuritif   te turned to mary who
still held the pen in her hand

  git dressed for travelin he ordered
pack yore suitcase in ten minutes were
pulhn out poco tiempo

short stories

  he turned to lane you stay here
with her while i hitch up a team to the

buggy

  mary walked back to her room and
packed her clothes she put a few things
in the suitcase but did not bother to pack
the trunk she had riot worn any of jan-
ice lees clothes as she had not been out
of the house since her arrival

  she was glad to leave the lazy a but
down in her heart was a fear that these
two men were not through with her yet
she had been living in sort of a daze ever
since that night at the restaurant in san
francisco and when she had asked
breen where he was going to send her lie
had said quint sabe-who knows

  she carried the suitcase in to the living-
room and sat down in an old rocking-chair
lane was helping himself to breens  mot-
tle and his hand trembled as he looked at
mary

  breen was hitching up a pair of vicious-
looking grays a half broken team h
was obliged to tie them to the corral fena
and drag the buggy around to them as
soon as they were hitched he went to th
house and flung open the front door

  you pull out ahead of us miles h
growled hit the grit hombre because
well need an open road

  lane placed the bottle on the table an
walked out going straight to his horse
which he mounted and rode swiftly away

  what about my trunk asked mart
breen turned from watching lane galloj
out of sight

  you dont need to worry about that

  mary shivered slightly as breen emptiei
the bottle down his throat and threw th
bottle viciously aside he picked up hei
suitcase and pointed toward the door

  start goin he growled mary pre
ceded him from the house and they wen
down to the corral where the gray tean
humped angrily under the feel of the bar
ness

  breen threw her suitcase in the back
the buggy and motioned her to get in
she sat down and looked at him he ha
turned and was staring past the end of tl
stable then he began running toward if
front of the stable which was near th
main gate

  he was within twenty yards of the gat
when cultus came in sight swinging hi
horse toward the gate mary saw breer
jerk to a stop throwing up his right hand
which held a six-shooter she tried to cry
out to cultus who was partly mask
from breen by the huge gate-post but be

i

ore she could inter any sound cultus
urned to come through the gate and
ireen fired

  cultus jerked sideways from the shock

ctl i

igainst the fence and stopped looking
ack at its rider

  breen ran up to him and quickly turned
lim over evidently satisfied that cultus
vas out of the game for good he ran back

o	the buggy and untied the horses which
vere still jerking nervously from the sound
f the revolver shot

  he climbed in beside mary whirled the
cam around and went out through the
jate at racing speed the lurch of the
mggy almost threw mary out and she did
lot get a look at cultus as-they raced past
reen did not try to check the horses his
raw was set tightly and mary could see
hat his lips were white he did not speak
lor look at her

  mary had only been over the road once
ut she knew it was even more dangerous
han the one she had ridden over in the
runaway the night she came to oreana
lity about a mile below the lazy a the
road looped around over some dizzy grades
 lbove a deep canyon and she remembered
hat cultus had remarked that it was a
lace where a driver was only allowed one
mistake

  she looked at breen wondering why he
lid not make any attempt to check the run-
ling team he was crouched on the edge
f the seat his feet drawn well under him
ilis eyes shut to mere slits as the buggy
lurched and bounded over the uneven road
they whirled down through a swale where
lie mesquite ripped along the wheels and
iides like the sound of tearing silk

  a rock sent them skidding wildly but
ihe buggy did not upset it threw mary
flo her knees but breen ripping out an
path yanked her back in the seat his elbow
striking her in the mouth as he recovered
iis balance she threw up both hands to
protect her face and the next instant
ireen had flung himself clear of the buggy
mary whirled around trying to see him
ut he was blotted out in a swirl of dust

  she jerked around in the seat and saw

just ahead of her the beginning of the
grades around the deep canyon there
was nothing she could do now to at-
tempt a jump from the buggy would mean
that she would have to choose between fall-
ing into the canyon or being smashed
against the rocky side of the grade

  the two horses were running at top
speed their bellies low to the ground the
lines whipping through the air the buggy
and its one occupant bounding along be-
hind them mary tried to pray but she
was so dazed so frightened that she could
only hang on

  they whirled around the first turn on
two wheels straightened perilously near
the outer edge and headed for the next
sharp curve it was a sharp turn to the
right and on the left hand side was an old
washout filled with brush

  but the running team turned too late
and the inside wheels of the buggy smashed
against the wall came a whirl of dust
and gravel a cataclysm of overturned
buggy flying hoofs the scream of a horse
and the outfit hurtled over the edge drop-
ping straight down for fifty feet where it
struck the apex of a broken ledge seemed
to hang for a moment and then went crash-
ing and rolling into the bottom of the gorge
a hundred feet below

cultus had seen idaho breen just
before the shot was fired and be-
fore the shock of the bullet had
knocked him unconscious he knew that
breen had shot him he was shocked
back to consciousness by a deluge of cold
water and opened his eyes to see hop the
chinese cook standing over him bucket in
hand

  you hut pletty damn bad queried
the chinaman anxiously

  cultus struggled to a sitting position
clamping his jaws to hold back the exclam-
ation of pain which came to his lips it
seemed that a red-hot iron was searing
deeply in his left shoulder he panted
for several moments while cold perspira-
tion dripped from his face

  but his mind cleared rapidly and the
chinaman helped him to his feet he
wasnt just sure why breen had shot him
he felt for his gun and found it still in the
holster

  why did he shoot me asked cultus
hoarsely

  the chinaman shook his head do
know i not see i hea

  cultus looked vaguely around as though
trying to see breen


short

  he ro way said hop he take li 
missie way in buggy mebbe go town
go like hell team lun way  o sabe

  -team run away 

  plitty bad team not bloke yet

  -for gosh sake cultus wiped the
back of a hand across his eyes  hop

was miles lane here today

  tessa he lide way jus befo you

come lide damn fast

  thats it muttered cultus a run-
away team-and those grades oh hop
ive been a fool

  cultus went gropingly out to his horse
which did not try to get away from him
he climbed into the saddle forgetting to
pick up his sombrero and spurred the ani-
mal savagely through the gateway and
down the road toward oreana city his
shoulder was bleeding and he was racked
with pain but he shut his teeth against the
hurt and weakness and drove the roan at
racing speed feeling down in his heart
that nothing could save mary smith now

  the tall roan slowed down the moment
they struck the grade and cultus half
blinded by pain and weakness swayed in

the saddle as he
peered over the
edge of the
grade knowing
that only a mir-
acle could pre-
vent the running
team from disas-
f	ter

  the first curve
showed nothing
except that
wheels had torn
deeply into the outer edge of the grade
but at the next turn he found the left
front wheel of the buggy which had torn
off from the impact against the rocky wall
here was also plenty of evidence that
something had gone off the edge as the
grade was sloughed off

  cultus dismounted and leaned against
his horse trying to overcome the dizziness
which caused his knees to sag he tried
to walk around the horse toward the edge
of the grade but he staggered like a
n mari and fell to his knees

  keep a-gom you quitter  he muttered

 icri j  goin to let yore own
body lay down on yuh  he stopped talk-
ing to himself and his eyes focused sharply
on a spot in the brush on the left side of
the road

   then he lurched to his feet staggered off
the road and tore his way into the brush

stories

where mary smith was half lying ha
sitting in the brush her eyes open a smea
of blood across her face when the bugg
struck the rocky wall it had thrown her t
the uphill side of the grade and into tli
tangle of brush

  cultus went to his knees beside her try
ing to disentangle her from the brusl
while she looked at him dazedly su
moning all of his strength he lifted
from the brush and carried her back to
road where he went to his knees again

  mary smith he said brokenly m
smith r 

  her eyes were open and she did not s
badly hurt but she did not know him

  i-i wanted to answer your note
told him but they watched me
closely i wanted to see you again

  she began crying softly and cultu
pawed clumsily at her hair trying to sootl
her

  yean i know he whispered shi
thought she was talking to dude wheeled
and cultus knew

 wheres idaho breen he asked
mary stared up at him the questiof
stirred something in her mind

  he jumped she said simply

  cultus nodded i thought he did 
cultus managed to catch his horse ij
was a difficult job for him to get into t
saddle with mary smith but he did i
the tall roan went slowly while cult
reeled in the saddle his arms locked arou
mary smith cultus forgot that he h
been shot it was a nightmare he though
someone was corning down the grade to
ward him and he laughed foolishly

  the man came up to him shoving h
horse in close now he was trying to ta
mary smith away from him cultus tried to
prevent this the man was talking to him
imploring him to let him take the girtj
cultus wanted to draw his gun on the man
but didnt dare let loose of mary with his
right hand it seemed to cultus that he
had lost his left hand

  the mans voice seemed familiar and
cultus tried to remember who he was it
suddenly dawned upon him that this man
was dude wheeler and he laughed aloud
at the queer kinks of a nightmare

  let me have her jones begged dude
man youre hurt

  this statement seemed to drive the mists
from cultus brain he could see dude
wheeler plainly now feel the surge of
dudes sorrel against the roan

  i want her jones said dude
  aw-ri cultus nodded drunkenly

cultus swayed weakly spurred his horse

ded for oreana city

miles lane lost no time in getting back
i oreana city he had no idea what
 ns idaho breen might have but lane
s just wise enough to absent himself to
vn where he could have a good alibi

 stabled his horse and headed for his of-
- just as the three cowboys from the
zy a rode in he waited for them at


the oreana hitch-rack and received a scowl
from pie ide

  what he jist said goes double for me
said mex im the smallest one of the
bunch and im plumb willin to hear all
the war-talk you can bring up

  lane turned on his heel and walked
away while the three cowpunchers guf-
fawed loudly and
went toward the
oreana their spurs
rasping belligerently
shifless hill had
ridden into town
ahead of the lazy a
b u n c h and they
found him in the oreana saloon

 a reckless spirit prompted omalia
woods to call shifless aside and he did
not mince matters when he told him of the
report miles lane had brought to idaho
breen shifless said nothing to affirm or
deny lanes report

  breen sent us down there to investi-
gate said omaha but we didnt find a
thing im jist tellin yuh this for yore
own benefit shifless not tryin to start
anythin with yuh

  much obliged omaha drawled shif-
less thats shore kind of yuh

  sb ifless moved slowly from the saloon
and went across the street to the store
where he bought a bag of peanuts then
he came out crunching them between his
strong teeth and went to miles lanes of-
fice the attorney started slightly at sight
of the big cowboy but relaxed with a
forced smile

  you dont look very well said shif-
less kinda chalky around the gills
lane swallowed heavily and shifted his
position no im all right
physically

  why yes certainly wliat did you
mean shifless


short stories

  morally shifless crunched slowly on
some peanuts you always pretended to
he inv best friend and so yuh sneaked out
to the old suicide mine and tried to put

the dead wood on me

  -why-uh-no no shi fless who
told you that f-i got lost last night

and--listen i-i-

  lane stopped to swallow he didn t
like the expression in the eyes of the big

   uv boy

  youve got the loop around yore feet
said shifless you sent the lazy a gang
out to get me miles lane

  but they didnt find anything ha ha
ha ha ha i knew they wouldnt find-

uh-listen shifless that was-

  you was tryin to play a joke on me
eh shi hess dusted his hands on the
knees of his chaps you thought it would
lie awful funny to me to git hung youve
shore got a sense of humor

  lane was speechless but his brain was
working swiftly he was in a precari-
ous position and he knew it well

  i runs across jones the detective said
shitless he knowed that jack keene
was dead  so i told him about what i found
in the paper and he went whalin back to-
ward the lazy a hes a queer sort of a
jigger he saw you sneak away from the
old mine this mornin miles

  he knew about jack keene

  shore did said he saw jack git shot
my god then that girl- lane
stopped realizing that he was talking too
much his hand shook as he reached into
a desk drawer getting to his feet as he did
so to mask the fact that he had taken a gun
from the desk

  what about the girl asked shifless
none of your business rasped lane
and ho turned end walked to the doorway
his mind in a whirl he was afraid of
jones of oklahoma who had seen jack
keene killed he wanted to see idaho
breen if idaho breen was bringing that
girl to oreana city he should be here by
this time he thought what could be
keeping him had jones reached the
lazy a before idaho and the girl were
ready to leave he wondered

  he saw cleve sears the pudgy sheriff
coming up the street lane swung away
from the office and hurried down to meet
the sheriff while shifless sauntered to the
office door and saw them meet farther
down the street

  hyah miles puffed the sheriff how
are yuh t day

  dont look toward my office cautioned

lane shifmess hill is watching us i
saw him butchering cattle at the old suicide
mine early this morning-in the shaft-
house the boys from the lazy a went
there to get him but he had thrown all the
evidence into the shaft there must be t
way to recover it cleve so you better ar-
rest shifless and put him in jail but
look out for him he knows i saw him
and he probably knows im telling you
about it now

  the sheriff nodded slowly are yuh
sure miles

  sure why i saw him he wouldnt
be butchering his own cattle up there in
that old building all weve got to do is to 
get the evidence out of the shaft

  and its two hundred feet deep but
ill arrest him if yuh say so miles and i
you can swear out the warrant later
thais all right cleve ill do it

  lane crossed the street headed for the
livery stable and shifless walked swiftly
across to the oreana saloon the sheriff
hesitated for several moments he hate
to arrest this big cowboy he had known
shifless for years and it was like arrest-j
ing his brother shifless had disappeared
in the saloon when the sheriff started
across the street

  but shifless did not stop in the saloonj
he surmised that lane had told the sheriff
so he walked straight through the saloon
went out the rear entrance and cirdi
around to the livery stable where he went
inside

  the stableman had led out lanes sad-
dle horse and was assisting lane in sal
dling it neither of them heard shiflesfl
come in and lane did not see him until he
turned his head and saw the big cowboy
leaning against the side of the stall sijm
feet away lanes eyes hardened and his
right hand fumbled at his coat pocket

yuh hadnt ought to do that warned
shifless yuh know i seen yuh put a
gun in that pocket and im superstitious
lane dropped his hand and reached fof
the reins

  you aint goin nowhere said shif-
less quietly he turned to the mystified
stableman you can yank the hull off
that critter and tie him back to the hay-i
box mr lane aint goin ridin-not

yet  	i

  what in hell do you mean asked lane
angrily since when did you start tell-
ing me what to do 

  well smiled shifless mr jones told
me to kinda keep an eye on you lane and
im not coin to ridp herd on vnh thats 

not goin to ride herd  yuh thats

                                                              
the loot of the lazy a



 didnt yuh no yuh dont need to lie
 ibout it

  you poor fool panted lane do
 ou think you can keep me from doing
 vhat i please

  i dunno miles it might be worth an
 experiment supposin you jist make a
 i teak

  lane flapped his arms helplessly
 something seemed to tell him that shif-
 ss hill was dangerous in spite of his
 izy grin and he knew that he could never
 et a gun from the side pocket of his coat

 as quickly a s
 shifless could
 draw from his
 holster

  a  right
 put the horse
 u p h e said
 hoarsely ill
 probably b e
 back for him
 pretty soon so
 you dont need
 bother taking the saddle off

  lane walked out the wide entrance and
 lii fless came behind him there was no
 gn of the sheriff but a man was running
 own the middle of the street-idaho
 -reen

  whats the matter with him gasped
 liles lane as idaho stumbled across the
 ciewalk and into the oreana saloon there
 i as no one to answer lane so he started
 tinning toward the saloon followed by
 iifless who ran awkwardly in his high-
 veled boots

 faith keene and her little boy came
 wn a cross street and stopped to let the
 o running men pass her shifless stop-
 fcd short beside her

  what is the matter shifless she
 iked anxiously he shook his head i
 nnt know faith it was the first time
 had ever called her faith theres
 tmethin wrong and it affects the lazy a
 nch i dont sabe it but i want to tell
 u somethin faith jack keene is dead
 ies been dead quite a while

 	she stared at him wonderingly jack
  ene dead shifless

 iyeah i found it out last night you
 li ter take the boy over to the store i
 nno what this all means but yuh better
 si in a safe place here comes the star x

 	fit-and the lazy a boys are already
 we

 maith nodded and hurried the little boy
  oss the street while shifless went

  i

straight to the oreana saloon where an ex-
cited crowd of men listened to idaho
breens story of how his team had run
away thrown him out and had gone over
the edge of the grade with mary ault

  aw she couldnt go over that edge and
live declared pie ide so whatsa use of
gettin the doctor

  the whole works went over panted
idaho  i ran all the way to town
couldnt do anythin alone she didnt
like it out there so she sold out to me to-
day he stopped to get his breath i
didnt have the money to buy it-not
enough to pay it all because she wanted a
big price-but ive got it-got a bill of sale
my god its awful i was bringin her
down early so she could get a train back to
san francisco

  well you couldnt help it said some-
one gosh thats an awful way to pass
out yuh can see it cornin

  well lets get out there snorted pie
ide lane had already joined the crowd
and a few moments later shifless walked
in followed by buck wing heinie mor-
iariuy klondike evans and joe chevrier

  the sheriff backed against the bar for-
getting all about arresting shifless in his
fear that the lazy a and the star x out-
fits might pick up the battle where they
had left off the night mary came to town
the star x boys halted just inside the
place and the sheriff seemed to think that
this was an opportune time to lake their
mind off any possible continuation of the
feud

  dont start anythin boys he said
warningly speaking to buck wing who
was in the lead this is no time to start
trouble miss ault lias jist been killed in
a runaway and were goin out to get her

  the sheriff stopped for several mo-
ments no one spoke lane stepped in close
to the sheriff and touched him on the arm

  get shifless hill he said shifless
was only a few feet away but made no
move to get away the sheriff scowled at
lane but stepped over to shifless who
still made no move

  shifless ive got to arrest yuh for
butcherin lazy a beef he said slowly
miles lane says he seen yuh doin it
so there aint nothin i can do

  thasall right cleve

  the rest of you jiggers get yore horses
somebody get a rig at the stable and some-
body else rustle the doctor said the sher-
iff

  the crowd made a break for the front
door fairly shoving shifless and the sher-


short stories

iff outside just across the narrow street
a small group had gathered around the

figure of a woman faith keene was on
her knees beside the figure talking to dude
wheeler

  coming across the street toward the ore-
ana saloon was the man whom they knew

as ones of oklahoma his shirt was
plastered with blood from the wound in his
left shoulder and he shambled in his walk
as though his knees were jointless his
face was dirty bloody but his jaws were
tight and there was hardly a line to show
where his ups were breen had been
shoved out at the forefront of the crowd
as was miles lane	

  what in thunder happened to you
gasped the sheriff

  cultus stopped bracing his feet far
apart his half shut eyes fixed upon idaho
breen who had whirled sideways as
though to try to force his way back through
the crowd

  breen dont move cultus voice
croaked like that of a raven breen was
half turned around as the men behind him
fought to get out of line

  dont move lane it was hardly
more than a whisper

  what is it panted the sheriff he
had forgotten that he had a prisoner
whats wrrong with you jones

  hes been shot said someone

  plumb loco

  blood all over him look out for
him boys

  dont move breen it was a weak
warning you bushwhacker you dirty
murderer thief you tried to steal the
lazy a oh ive got the goods on you
 seen jack keene killed i know your
game and you tried to murder that girl
to cover your steal-you and miles lane

 idaho breen was game his hand
flashed back to his holster came back so
swiftly that few saw him make his draw
hut the bloody-faced cowboy bracing his
knees to stay on his feet only made one
move his right hand dangling loosely at
ins side lipped up nnd forward firing the
gun almost as it left the holster

  came the crash of breakingglass  the
store-front across the street when breens
bullet missed cultus by several feet and
breen pitched forward on his face flinging
his gun almost out to cultus feet

  i or a moment everyone had forgotten
miles lane lie darted sideways running
swiftly toward the hitch-rack taking s
chance that no one would shoot at him for
fear of killing a horse he had drawn a

gun the crowd surged toward him
liardly knowing what to do cultus was
running slowly toward the hitch-rack cut-
ting across in au angle to try and prevent
lane from going norlh

  swiftly lane untied a wicked-looking
gray horse which bore the star x brand
the horse whirled madly as lane caught
a foot in the stirrup and he was forced to
drop his gun iij order to make the mount

  again the horse whirled as cultus ran
toward it and lanes right knee was atop
the saddle fighting to kep his balance
he managed to get seated but before he 
could swing the horse around cultus had i
jlung one arm around the frightened ani- i
mals head swinging sideways with his i
whole weight

  with a scream of rage and fright the
star x gray seemed to fairly pin-wheel on 
one front leg and crashed down  its
right side flinging lane under the feet of 
several rearing pulling broncos which 
were doing their best to break away

  quickly the crowd rushed in cut the 
horses loose and got lane while some of
them lifted cultus out of the dirt and car-i
ried him away from the hitch-rack he
sat up and looked around a half grin on
his grimy face

  by god thats bull-doggin em
snorted pie ide propping cultus head
against his knee howr are yuh jones
the sheriff shoved his way to cultus
breens dead he said weve sent for
the doctor for lane hey are yuh lis-
tenin to me that ault girl aint dead
shes over there across the street whats
it all about jones did breen shoot yuh
cultus looked up at him is lane
badly hurt

  he shore is kicked and tromped all
to pieces

  help me up will yuh

  they helped cultus to his feet and buck
wing and pie ide assisted him over toj
where lane was lying the doctor was
just looking him over when they arrived
lane was conscious but badly hurt he
scowled at cultus and groaned under the
examination of the doctor

  cultus looked up to see mary smith 
faith keene dude wheeler and shifless i
hill mary smith was very pale weakj
but beyond the shock of her fall and a tew
minor bruises she was all right the doc-
tor shook his head and got to his feet

  that means im all through eh whis-
pered lane tell me the truth doc

  im sorry lane youre right
the loot of the lazy a



breen  he asked his eyes fixed on cul-

  is

ied to smile but the pain was too much
did jack keene shoot jud ault asked
ultus lane shifted his eyes and looked
faith who was looking down at him

her eyes wide
with amazement
and fright lane
slowly shook his
head

  breen shot

wearily

  breen did
lane turned his
head and looked
at cultus

  you know he
d jones hes gone so it wont hurt
cm any

then cultus knew that jack keene had
ot jud ault but that miles lane was
ying to save a heartache for faith

i was sure he did replied cultus
kets clear it all up this time lane was
ini fless hill guilty of what you said

 the crowd turned away cultus was
graying in his tracks when shifless
might him mary ran to him grasping
rs hands he tried to smile at her but it
aias only a grimace he felt a hand on his
loulder and turned to see dude wheeler
 good boy jones whispered dude
aou sure cleaned up the crooks well
t you to the doctor

 im all right whispered cultus you
uk out for mary

vl hope to jones all my life
jcultus looked at mary everything was
ipy and her face seemed to stand out
lm the fog as it did the night he met
r in san francisco she was smiling
ough her tears

  i wanted you to know it first she said
i am going to marry dude wheeler
jones of oklahoma you have almost killed
yourself bringing me happiness

  i-i think it was worth it mary eliza-
beth he said trying to smile

they seemed to fade out and he was
talking to shifless and faith
keene

  ive told her the whole story jones
said shifless she had to know that for
over a year ive been stealin lazy a cat-
tle sellin em to a butcher in welcome
creek and givin her the money the money
jack keene was supposed to be sendin
her but she wont prosecute me because
she owns the lazy a now

  wre do shifless corrected faith
or soon will

  cultus laughed softly im glad im
sorry for breen and lane but theres
enough happiness to more than balance it
is that doctor ever goin to quit foolin
around and do somethin for my shoulder
im sure gettin weak in the knees

  youre all fixed up said faith this
is the first time youve been rational since
the shooting three days ago youll be as
good as new in a few days youll have to
be because you are going to be best mail
at a double wedding

  cultus stared up at the ceiling and
around the room

  and both the star x and the lazy a
gangs are settin outside the house waitin
for the doctor to tell em youll get well
said shifless

  settin together queried cultus
have been for three days theyre
workin the place in relays like me and
faith and dude and mary theyll be
here soon

  mary has told us the whole story said
faith softly personally i think she
should have married you

  cultus shook his head slowly averting
his eyes no-o-o its better this way
yuh see he turned and smiled bravely
im kind of a nervous disposition and id
never be contented with a wife that-that
was always ridin runaways

  shifless laughed heartily and won-
dered why it didnt sound funny to faith
-who understood but the looting of the
lazy a was over the feud ended so cul-
tus smiled and went to sleep realizing that
he would need more strength to be best man
at a wedding than he would to be best man
at a gun-fight
idols

by l patrick greene
author of an aching affair bush shadows

etc

    the major and jim tue hottentot finally reached the mountains of
    the moon after the long trek on which they have followed
    the red idol and a stranger adventure than they had yet en-
    countered awaited them there in the great caverhs of mystery

f g he flames of the campfire died
down only a bed of ashes re-
mained and their glow did little
more than pick out in red high-
lights the features of the soli-
tary watcher by the fire making him look
as if he were wearing a grotesque mask
giving him the appearance of a good na-
mred gargoyle

  lie sat very close to the fire his naked
feet almost in the embers and draped
about his shoulders he wore several thick
woolen blankets even so he shivered
and his teeth chattered together as the cold
wind howled through the tops of the
stunted trees it was sub-tropical africa
but that wind was born among the snow
clad peaks of the mountains of the moon

  to the right and left of the watcher
perilously close to the fire huddling to-
gether for warmth were the figures of
men men who had been overcome by the
coma-like sleep of physical exhaustion
f hey had trekked until they could trek no
tart her and then dropping to the ground
had not moved again-sleeping where they
ell all about them were the loads they
had been carrying loafs which had grown
lighter with each passing day loads which
had strangely seemed heavier with each
forward pace not one of the packs had
been opened not even the one containing



food sleep for once had been more ar-
dently desired than food

  with a palpable effort the watcher by
the fire rose to his feet letting the blanks
fall from his shoulders he stood there
for a moment stretching yawning widely
reflecting the fire glow his magnifies
torso his overlong muscular arms
brawny thighs and calves looked as if they
were hewed out of polished bronze

  stooping he put more logs on the fire
a shower of sparks leaped up appearing
like a swarm of fire-flies and were swi
up by the wind and emptied into the
blackness of the night

  dense clouds of smoke poured forth j
from the wood clouds which momentarily
brightened breaking at length into a fierce
flame which illumined the ground

  with an impatient click the watchf
picked up his blankets and spread them
wide so that their shadow fell athwart the
face of a white man who slept on a bed of
cut grass some little distance away he
moaned softly in his sleep like an over tired 
child

  presently the flames died down again i
giving place to fragrant smoke which drove
away the few tenacious mosquitoes the cold
had not killed

  t he watcher looked up at the black man-
tle of the sky noting the location of the

                                                        
idols

southern cross among the myriads of stars
vhich painted the heavens with an eerie
hosphorescent glow

it is time-past time he muttered in
he clicking dialect of a hottentot i will

	and wake the baas

he took a few tentative almost somnam-
ulistic steps toward where the white man
-as sleeping

then he stopped hesitated and returned

 	the fire

he picked up a water bag and drank
reedily the rest of its contents he poured
ver his head shivering as the icy stream
ickled down his back and his barrel-like

best

now-i have no desire for sleep he
lid writh a soft chuckle i will keep both
atches-the baas is tired he has had to
 trry the burden of the grumblings of these
uny fools- his scornful gesture em-
riced the sleeping carriers-set before
im ai-e and he did more than that
he shame of it one he carried on his
rack when the fools legs could n longer
i ipport him my baas should have left
snat man to die but if he had-he would
ot have been my baas 

he sat down again beside the fire pull-
ug his blankets about him staring fixedly

	the flames wnth eyes half veiled by
 eep-heavy lids

his head dropped lower rested at last
in his up-drawn knees his mouth sagged
nde open his eyes closed

t ime passed

 jim the hottentot slept

there were furtive rustlings in the bush
r eyond the clearing of the camp faint
ri-hispers mingled with the howling of the
 ind there was a metallic clatter in-
itantly silenced as of steel dropping upon
 rock

a tree hyrax screamed nearby it was
ja ominous note like the strident wailing
f a child in a place where one is sure no
j lild could be it seemed like a blasphem-

-	is outcry against the cathedral hush of the
shrsh

the hottentot opened his eyes with a
aart he grinned self-consciously as he
azed all about him at the forms of the
keeping men at the trees beyond the cir-
i- of flickering firelight he listened for
rtj-me alien noise a whisper from the black-
ss of the bush tliat would indicate the
esence of intruders

	finally his eyes had seen nothing his
normally keen ears had heard nothing lie
hed with relief save for himself and
e sleepers the bush was an empty wil-

derness there was nothing to fear save
-save the blood-congealing cold he
wriggled closer to the fire pulling his blan-
kets yet closer about him

  there was a noise behind him first the
sharp hissing intake of breath of a man
who has plunged his head into cold water
then the soft tread of booted feet

  jim the hottentot grinned he could
have distinguished that footfall amongst
the tread of a thousand marching men

  ihe white man his baas had risen and
was standing now behind him

  jim-it is past time long past you
should have called me

  an unseeing listener would have said a
native was speaking so perfectly did the
white man pronounce the vernacular

  i have no need of sleep baas the
hottentot replied i will take both
watches the baas must sleep he has
trekked far today and the way was very
hard

  the white man laughed softly

  and you-you did not trek is that
what you would say you rode on the
back of your grandsire a baboon for
you the way was easy yet i think but
for you your baas would have perished in
the quicksands but for you he-

  it was nothing the hottentot inter-
rupted hastily we are men we do not
keep a tally of such things even so the
count is in your favor and as i have
said what i did today was nothing

  truly the white man murmured to
risk ones life in order that another may
live is always a small thing but i am a
man-not such a man as jim the hotten-
tot  there is none like him-therefore i
will keep watch and you will sleep

  he sat down on a pack close to the hot-
tentot who knowing that further expostu-
lations were useless spread his blankets on
the ground rolled himself up in them and
prepared for sleep

  you saw nothing during your watch
jim  the white man asked

  i saw nothing i heard nothing baas
there is nothing to fear and i- then
sleep caught him in its overpowering am-
bush and his words trailed oft into a rau-
cous snore

  the white man-he was known through-
out south africa and points north east
and west as the major known as a man
who played all games squarely for the
games sake and not for the rewards to be
won-smiled wistfully

  poor old jim he mused drawling the
words affectedly hes absolutely played
 

out never seen him look so leastly fag-
ged before and weve been together for
five ten nearly fifteen years but no won-
der the dear old chaps tired on top of
a hard trek at an altitude which makes one s
bally old heart pump overtime he takes it
upon himself to keep my watch as well as
his own the dear old fool

  he nibbed his square clean shaven chin
reflectively his gray eyes held a half mys-
tic half wondering light in them

  yes he continued slowly its a brute
of a country even the carriers and
theyre indigent to the soil in a manner of
speaking are absolutely tuckered out my
word the things weve been through
that beastly quagmire-miles of it the
jungle the lava rocks the cold the heat
mosquitoes flies and all manner of un-
clean crawling things the steady up-
hill grind and for what

  he fumbled in his tunic pocket and from
it took a small image cut from some iron-
hard wood it was a hideous thing
carved by a master craftsman it was a
startlingly realistic representation of a bes-
tial negro there was something elemen-
tal about it it suggested the dark soul of
darker africa glowing red in the fire-
light it looked as if it had been but re-
cently dipped in blood

  the face was that of a west coast na-
tive the facial and body scarifications in-
dicated its connection with the all power-
ful egbo society its sinewy clutching
hands clasped about its enormous belly
seemed indicative of its creators ambition
to subject the whole world to the rule of his
people

  the major closed his lingers upon it
with a gesture of disgust

  and ive been following the trail of the
bally thing for months his thoughts ran
on simply because a red-haired johnny
of a yank told me a wild tale concerning it
of a white girl-his sister-and her uncle
held prisoners in the mountains of the
moon by natives who are plotting to end
the white rule in africa an incredible
story oh absolutely yet- he shook
his head-the yankwas killed because of

this grinning image and-

  he was overwhelmed by an avalanche
n t recollections  is minds eye was filled
with visions of the perilous adventures
which had befallen him since he had fol-
lowed the trail of the red idol the trail
which had brought him to this place-the
lower slopes of the mountains of the
moon

  faced with such evidence lie could not

short stories

 ociety

doubt the existence of a secret s
which was insinuating its influence in
south african kraals

        z

  and yet- his voice once again gave
utterance to his thoughts-as far as  a
judge its not a malevolent influence our
troubles-mine and jims-apart from the
natural difficulties of the trail liave been
instigated by men who used the society
for their own benefit and one cant i
judge a society by the black sheep among itsjj
members might as well say-for exam
pie-that all white men wear-er-mon-
ocles because i happen to do so and
wouldnt if it were not for the fact that
monocle makes me look such an innocen
chappy and i suppose i am innocent i
it comes to that oh rather however
to resume i fancy my account with the
black sheep is settled in full actually the
johnnies at the head of the bloomin orde
owe me a rising vote of thanks i sha
point that out to them if i ever meet ihera
but will i ever meet them i have m
doubts grave doubts im beginning
believe its all a myth quite here we ar
on the threshold of their reputed strong
hold and absolutely not a sign to show
which way to turn theres nothing here

tains stand guard i dont believe there

ciety

  he chuckled softly

  but now what to do acknowlec
its all a dream that what red h
told me was simply a figment of his vet

vivid imagination as jim insists or-

  he rose slowly to his feet and paced
slowly up and down endeavoring to maw
shal his thoughts in some semblance of or 
der even such mild exercise altect
him his lungs strained at the rarefied air
his heart pounded with a force that tlire
ened to release it from the confines of hi
powerful chest

  well leave it to chance he mutter
presently as stooping over he placed th
red idol on the ground beside jim whei
he wakes tin and sees that his first reactioi

 will be to throw it in the fire-he thinks it
 is evil witchcraft and i think hes right
 so if he does that we will start back to-
 morrow with the carriers if on the other
 hand he checks his impulse and brings the
 idol to me-well then well stay and see
 the thing through and somehow im
 inclined to think well start back

   he sighed as a man will who turns his
 jack on a long sought for goal and resumed
 his restless pacing to and fro

   he was dressed in a suit of white duck
 ind as he passed in and out of the circle
 jf light thrown by the fire his appearance
 was ghost-like or at least grotesquely alien
 o his environment

   pie halted presently at the edge of the
rlearing silhouetted for a fleeting second
igainst the blackness beyond by a log
v which suddenly burst into flame

   then-darkness encompassed him and
 le vanished

   there were stealthy rustlings in the un-
 iergrowth the heavy breathing of men
 struggling under a heavy load

   again silence a silence intensified by
djie screaming of a hyrax

eefore the sun rose when the bush
 was a place of gray wraith-like
 shadows and the mountains were
 lihrouded with mist the carriers awoke as
 i at a given signal silently they rose
 cook up some of the packs and vanished-
 reading south

   but jim the hottentot slept on what
 meed had he to fear was not his baas
 lis baas who could do no wrong keeping
 s vatch 

   his hand moved out instinctively toward
 h he fire and his fingers brushed against the
 ed idol closed on it and gripped it tightly

 	   he girl and the man shivered to-

 gether beside the roaring fire which
  jl lighted up the deepest recesses of the

 	ave occasionally a gust of wind blew
 p through the caves opening fluttering
 reside the heavy curtain of skins in disdain
 if mans feeble attempts to block its pass-

  it was a cold wind frost laden and
 nocked the heat of the fire it caused the
 an and girl to pull their skin coverings
 ill closer about them

   the girl laughed softly

   if we ever get out of this mess uncle
   le said and tell our friends that we
   arly froze to death beside a big fire in
   juatorial africa theyll never believe us
   her companion nodded he was a thin
   

undersized little man his gray beard had
apparently been clumsily trimmed with
blunt tools but despite that and the
greasy skins which were his only clothing
he looked like a man of affairs in the civil-
ized world his head was well-shaped
the big dome of his forehead suggested that
he housed a brain stocked with scientific
lore and the eyeglasses he wore-even if
they were cracked and in place of the
black silk ribbon which in other days se-
cured them had a piece of knotted string
-gave him the precise intellectual appear-
ance of a college professor

   if we ever get out of this mess alice
he said slowly we will have far more as-
tonishing tales to tell die world than one of
being frozen that is not astonishing
when one considers the altitude of our-er
-prison but- he sighed-im afraid
our chances of rescue are hopeless and this
plan of yours sheer folly i should never
have brought you on this trip-

  ssh dear she placed her firm
shapely hand over his mouth youve
said that a hundred and one times and
ive interrupted you a hundred and one
times just as im doing now youve
nothing to blame yourself for and if i died
tomorrow-ive had an awful lot of fun
even this experience has been worth while
we havent been treated so badly you
know plenty of food plenty to drink
exercise-somewhat restricted ill admit-
and clothes latest fashions from the
mountains of the moon what more can
a girl want

  she laughed and rubbed her hands up
and down the leopard and monkey skins
which-with a -womans knack of such
things-she had transformed into a bar-
baric costume

  john harding ph d looked proudly at
his niece

  white blood cant be beaten he mur-
mured

   of course not the girl echoed swiftly
 specially not when it is opposed to black
and mondaras blood is of the blackest
in spite of his college degrees and his show
of civilizations culture lies a savage at
heart and is superstitiously afraid of the
mysterious men at the head of this move-
ment and so i say my plan will suc-
ceed

  harding moved restlessly

  i dont altogether approve alice if
we fail-well only hasten the end w hy
not wait maybe red managed to win
through and is heading a relief expedition
perhaps this white man mondara talks


short stories

about is the advance guard of the expedi-

tllthe girl shook her head decisively

  no red was killed-poor old red-
at lourenco marquez yes i believe
mondara about that hes a liar i know
but the vindictive gleam in his eyes when he
told us about it was too real to be feigned
no weve got to make a dash for it this
morning it will be easy if mondaras
afraid of his skin as i think he is well
make for the camp of this white man and
then- she shrugged her shoulders-if
they come after us-

  and of course they will harding in-
terposed

  well die as whites should the girl
concluded calmly

  she rose and wrapping her skins closely
about her went to the opening of the cave
holding back the skin curtain

  two natives armed with long-bladed
spears stood on guard they were al-
most naked yet seemed indifferent to the
bitter cold

  she answered their scowling looks with
a smile and stammered a few words in the
vernacular they made no response save
to chuckle softly at her ludicrous pronun-
ciation

  she drew herself crect and braced her-
self to meet the furious spasmodic gusts
of wind she looked up at the fading
stars the blackness of night was fast giv-
ing way to the somber gray of early morn-
ing but she could see very little would
have seen less had she not known what to
look for and where

  she knew that the cave was one of the
many man-made holes in the walls of a
crater-like depression-an extinct volcano
her uncle said she knew that less than
two feet from where the guards were
standing the wall dropped a sheer two
hundred feet to the bed of the crater and
that crater was a fertile oasis amidst a
chaos of barren snow-crowned heights

  lightened by the mystical glow of false
dawn she could see far below the roofs
of numberless huts the light faded

rested for a moment on a huge grotesque
idol just to the left of the cave then van-
ished clouds of white mist rolled down

from the heights above

  the girl shivered but a light of deter
mi nation shone in her eyes as she returnee
to the fire

  the man looked up inquiringly

  is it time alice

  soon uncle the false dawn has gone

i- she laughed nervously-i can hardly
contain myself

  you think wed better go through wit
it alice its a gamblers chance at th
best if we lose-we lose everything

therell le no hope for us we-

  its the only way she said decidedly
we must make mondara our prisoner
and force him to show us the way out o
the crater

  i know it alice just the same ic
like to christen this with the brutes blood

  he flourished a stone-headed club
was just such a weapon as the first cave
dweller might have wielded

  they were silent for a little while

  do you think hell come alice the
man said

 he always has uncle so whj
shouldnt he this morning of all morn
ings oh hell come i have no doubt
that and ask the same beastly question
but- her eyes glowed-he wont g
quite the same answer

  her hand opened and closed about the
haft of a keen-bladed wooden knife she was
holding

  it will be easy she continued talkii
chiefly to calm her uncles fears he wi
come in alone in that insolent way of his
he makes a show of bravery but he think
we are unarmed but this time well sur-
prise him well rush him before he has
time to draw his revolver or give an alani
and then when hes our prisoner hell do
anything we ask him to once he unde
stands that well kill him if he re fuss

hes a coward and-

  and a little mad i think her unc
supplemented

  she nodded agreement

  yes thats what makes him so da
gerous-and our ultimate success so sur
rays of golden light crept into the cav
dulling the fire gleams the tread of
booted feet sounded on the rocks outside
they heard a mans voice singing a ballad
of the london music halls

  hes coming the girl whispered and
moved quickly taking up a position behind
a large boulder near to the caves entrano
idols	

 professor harding rose the stone- lessly we thought you were mondara

 headed club gripped tightly in his hand and-

 and tiptoed with exagg rated caution to an 
 angle in the wall of the cave directly op-
 posite the girl he was a ludicrous com-
 bination of modern savant and prehistoric

man

    the footsteps had come to a halt the
 song ended they could hear the new-
 comer exchanging ribald jokes with the
 guards then sounded the patter of naked
 feet the night guards had been dis-
 missed others had taken their place

 the skin curtain before the opening
 trembled a mans voice sounded forming
 the english words with precise primness
 now i go to talk to the pretty lady it

said	

    long black fingers appeared at the edge
 of the screen which bulged slightly show-
 ing the outline of a mans form

    suddenly the curtain screen was pulled
 on one side and a man entered the screen
 falling into place behind him

    with half suppressed cries of triumph
 alice and her uncle swiftly closed on him
 the professor aimed a blow at the intruder
 with the stone club but so great was his ex-
 i citement missed the weapon descending

 	with a jarring blow on the mans shoulder

  making him lose his balance sending him
 i headlong to the floor

   transformed for the moment into a
 blood lustful savage the little professor
  raised his weapon again but before he
 -n could strike the girl pushed him away

   dont she cried quiet dont
  you see this is not mondara this is
 r a white man

    she knelt down beside the fallen man
 cutting the bonds which tied his feet loosely
 together taking the gag from his mouth
 j voicing apologies and hasty explanations

     its all right dear miss the other said
 t sitting up with an effort answering the
  look of deep concern in her eyes im
 i quite all right quite charmed by the very
 r warm reception you gave me but what is
 i it all about if i may ask

 the little professor very self-conscious
 at and ashamed of his exhibition of beserk

 	b fury knelt clown beside the stranger and
 a gently fingered his shoulder with exploring
   understanding fingersr

    nothing broken he exclaimed in re-
 ijilief but youll have a most painful
 hi bruise i aimed for your head im glad

 lill missed-

    so am i the other interrupted

    you see the girl explained breath-

i see-yes and who is this mondara
you were prepared to greet so lovingly

the girl did not answer instead she
looked helplessly at her uncle

  i told you it was no use that man be-
gan and finished with a dismal groan

  it had suddenly occurred to them both
that their last chance of escape had van-
ished that the new captive must be the

white man at
whose camp they
had intended to
seek safety and
hard on that
realization fol-
lowed the
thought that
their jailer un-
doubtedly knew
of their plan to
escape

  the girl shrugged her shoulders in a
gesture of despair the wonderful courage
and confidence which had supported her
during the long months of captivity sud-
denly left her and she buried her face in
her hands

  her uncle rose and crossing over to her
patted her comfortingly on the back

  then with startling suddenness the
other man commenced to laugh hysterically
and to babble an incoherent jumble of eng-
lish and native words he bowed his head
to the ground patted the girls feet and
called her strange sounding names

  she drew back with a little cry of fear
thinking that the stranger had gone sud-
denly mad she looked to her uncle for an
explanation and when that man winked
meaningly at her she understood vaguely
the reason for it all

  a high tittering laugh drew her attention
to the entrance to the cave and she turned
in time to see a man enter

  he was dressed in a loud plaid suit of
thick tweed the trousers were turned up
to display his gaudy socks his long light
brown shoes were very pointed and he
moved with mincing steps a stiff white
collar forced him to hold his weak chin high
and the color of his skin in contrast to it
looked darker than ebony his coarse
crinkled hair had been plastered with some
strong smelling pomade and his black eyes
glittered with malicious mirth

  in his right hand he held a revolver and
with it menaced the three

and how do you like your new friend
he asked suavely you should be most
short stories

 

rateful to me knowing how eager you
were to seek his company i caused him to
be brought here to you-thus saving you

a tiresome journey

  the girl did not answer her uncle mut-
tered angry curses and the stranger still

babbling foolishly crept on hands and
knees toward the ornately dressed native

  back that man ordered sharply go
back his voice ended in a frightened
squeak and when the white man stil came
on he retreated swiftly and shouted an or-
der to the guards outside

  two powerful natives immediately en-
tered and after a short struggle succeeded
in trussing up the white man who was so
evidently afflicted by the spirits because
of that they exercised no more force than
was absolutely necessary

  their task done they again left the cave

  the native laughed affectedly

  im afraid your good uncle hit our
friend too hard he said so now-
his eyes glittered-i must ask you to give
to me the club so cleverly manufactured
professor quick throw it gently so
that it falls at my feet

  professor harding hesitated a moment
and then threw the weapon with all his
force at the mans head

  that was foolish the native said icily
as he dodged the hurtling weapon you
will have to pay for that and now your
knife alice dear

  the girls anger rose at the mans leer-
ing familiarity but she obeyed his order
with a pose of meekness

  the native picked it up and examined it
with an elaborate show of interest

  what a foolish waste of time he said
to think that you could catch me off my
guard as if i didnt know what you
were doing and what your foolish plans
were you must have forgotten profes-
sor that walls-even the thick walls of this
cave-have ears and im afraid you
won t have time to make more weapons i
have at last persuaded the great ones to
send me out as a missionary that is
funny is it not and you will go with me
on my terms or-

  he passed his finger significantly across
his throat

  we prefer this professor harding
lure  mitated tlie others ges-

  it is for you to say the native looked
at alice

  i have already given you my answer
many times mondara death is prefer-
able to the shame which-

  but think he urged once free of
this place i will take you to america or
france or where you will i have great
wealth-diamonds rubies gold i told the
great ones that wealth-white mans
wealth-was necessary if i was to preach
the black mans creed i told them that
with wealth i could buy white men could 
hasten the day the great ones wait for
and that is true au-a i know have
i not lived in the countries of white men
and so the great ones have given me
freely of their stores i go from this

place the richest man in the world i--i

   all this is of no interest to us the girl
interrupted coldly talking to you is
time wasted and as for your wealth-j
we know your end in a very little while m
you will be penniless and you will crawls
back here-if you dare but you will notjj
dare confess to the great ones that youl
have been false to their trust

  he was nonplussed for the moment

  but you underestimate my wealth hefl
said then i do not lie when i say that
i will be the richest man in the world-the
wealth of solomon is at my command

fiere in these hills are the mines- 

  he broke off abruptly looked furtively
about him then repeated the wealth offl
solomon is at my command

  but not his wisdom professor hard-
ing murmured

  and what of your mission the girlf
continued as if she could not grasp the
horror of his suggestion what of the
great ones aim to make all africa black
w hat of the part you are to play in order
to bring about the fulfillment of their arn-
bition

  he laughed at that

  as if i care the great ones arejj
fools they work and plan for future
generations what are the future gener-
ations to me nothing-less than noth-
ing i pretended to side with them in or-b
der to gain some of the treasure they havel
stored up possessed of that-i leave af-j
rica and the great ones to stew in theirf
own juice

  then besides your other evils you aref
a traitor to your people

  have it that way if you please i shall 
call myself a prince as i did at college in i
england my royal blood will give me the i
entree to houses my wealth alone fails to
open i shall be received everywhere with
open arms white men will fight each

other for my friendship and-

  yes-you are quite mad the girl said
idols



slowly if i could only see the great

ones and tell
them the truth

about you-

h e laughed
derisively

  if you could
see them and
could speak t o
them in a lan-
guage they un-
derstand and
 tell them what i
have told you my life would not be worth
that he snapped his fingers but you
cant see them-and if you did you
couldnt talk to them they understand
r language but their own and now  will
you reconsider your decision

  he scowled as she turned her back upon
him

  if you do not come freely ill take you
by force he threatened and your uncle
will die slowly

  and i would live only long enough to
kill you she replied slowly

  a staccato drum-beat sounded in the val-
ley of the crater

  i go now mondara said i will give
you until tomorrow and then if you
havent decided to fulfill my conditions

-

  with his threat unfinished he quickly left
the place

  the girl went to the cave opening and
peering out saw the native disappear down
the steep narrow path cut out of the side
of the rock which led to the bed of the
crater

  returning to the cave she saw her uncle
sitting beside the bound man whispering
excitedly

  joining them she bent over to unfasten
the bonds telling her uncle to help

  has mondara gone the professor
asked

  she nodded

  eoth the men sighed with relief

  then thats all right dear miss the
bound man said in a normal voice no
dont loosen the bonds the mondara
chappy may return and its just as well
that he should continue to think im a lit-
tle-er-mad

  but whats to be gained the girl
asked by pretending that and why not
let us loose you with your help we
might be able to overpower the guards
and-

no that wont do dear miss any
false move just now would hasten our

deaths i think and whilst theres life
theres hope i played the giddy ass as it
were because i thought i might get near
enough to jump on that poisonous bounder
but he wasnt having any as you saw
and then i decided to carry on the farce
dont know why-no doubt theres a good
reason waiting to be found

  at least the professor said slowly
youve made yourself a person of some
importance in the eyes of the guards they
tnink youre really mad and therefore un-
der the protection of the spirits

  ah thatll no doubt come in useful
some time and now introductions and
what not are in order i think you are
professor harding and this is your niece
miss alice as for me-im aubrey st
john-generally known as the major
the girl bowed gravely

  and now continued the major i
think we ought to examine our resources
exchange information and so forth and
i dont think we ought to waste much time
i am inclined to think that mr mondara
will have me transferred to another cell
very shortly yes hes much too wise a
bird to put all his eggs in one basket as it
were

  the professor nodded agreement

  our story is soon told he said and
the sum total of our knowledge is very lit-
tle with my nephew and niece i came to
this district in search of certain scientific
data bf accident-actually i fell down
the shaft of an ancient mine and broke my
leg-i stumbled upon the existence of a
secret society which planned to make the
black race supreme throughout all africa
a red idol a powerful symbol of the so-
ciety also came into my possession be-
lieving at the time tliat a blood- rebellion
was being planned i sent my nephew down
country with the idol and a full report of
my discovery

  the same day he departed my carriers
deserted and we were taken prisoners by
mondara and brought to this place that
was months ago since then i have dis-
covered-you heard how mondara talks a
little while ago-that the heads of the so-
ciety have no thought of overpowering the
whites by force but are concentrating their
resources on the educating of their people

i think-

  may i ask questions the major in-
terrupted it will be quicker

  im afraid im very vague the profes-
sor apologized and your suggestion s a
good one


 have
 ciety

you

 seen

short stories

the heads of the

 so-

    no except mondara and the guards
 we have seen no one all the time we have
 been here no one to talk to that is of
 course when we have taken exercise on the
 narrow ledge outside we have seen people
 down in the valley of the crater

   have you spoken to the guards

   no tthey do not speak english nor
 do they understand my swahili

   they arc west coast natives  the ma-
 jor explained but you have been here
 months you say surely you liave learned

 their language

  no how could i they don t talk
 even to each other in my hearing they
 dont attempt to converse with me i have
 only spoken to mondara

   the major frowned

  um hes a clever blighter so all
 you know is what hes seen fit to tell you 
 yes the professor admitted but
 im quite sure that he has not lied to us
 about the society he lies about his own
 personal prowess and so forth of course
 but his overweening egotism and his con-
 fidence that we cannot give information
 against him impells him to speak freely
 about the society and its endless ramifica-
 tions i think for instance that we may
 accept all that he said this morning as sub-
 stantially true

   including the story of solomons trea-
 sure

   including that

   that makes my fingers itch the ma-
 jor muttered and this stone idol
 johnny just outside the cave do they wor-
 ship that

    think not the professor replied
 slowly no i am sure they do not it
 is simply a perpetual reminder of the aims
 of the society it personifies the triumph of
 the black race

   um funny place to put it still i
 imagine it can be seen quite plainly from
 below

                      t h e little wooden
                    idol i sent down coun-
                    try with my nephew is
                    a facsimile of it the
                    professor continued

 and how did that
 come into your hands 
 there was a man
 down at the bottom of
 the shaft-the one i
 fell down you under-
 stand he was on guard there he tried
 to kill me i shot him he could speak

 -he told me many things
 i took the idol from him
 was a funny experi-

 english a little-
 before he died
 afterward it

 ence-

   and under what conditions does mon-
 dara offer you freedom

   my promise to marry him the girl
 said evenly

   phew he is a little mad isnt he
 hes advanced just that little beyond the
 savage which makes hum very dangerous
 but what was your plan of escape which
 my capture knocked on the head

   we were going to attack mondara cap-
 ture him a-id make him lead us to your
 camp

   then you knew i was in the neighbor-
 hood how

   mondara told us he lias been giving
 us reports of your progress for the jast
 three weeks drum talk you know 
 thought you were the advance guard of a
 rescue party my nephew red had suc-
 ceeded in getting together i had begun
 to think that mondara lied to us when he
 told us that red had been killed

   that was no lie the major said
 gravely i was with him he told me
 about you and i promised him to bring
 help

    there was silence for a little while

   but why did you come alone the
 professor asked

   no one would come with me-the of-
 ficials laughed at the idea of a secret so-
 ciety and all that oh well we must
 put our heads together and think up a way
 to get out of this	

   only a miracle can help us the girl
 said with a sigh please tell me about my
 brother

   he- the major began then began to
 laugh boisterously as he struggled to free
 his hands from the ropes which bound
 them

    the girl started back as if at a blow but
 at once mondara accompanied by four
 powerful natives entered the cave

   you are clever very clever mister
 aubrey st john major he said scoffingly
 but not so clever as mondara i left you
 thinking you mad but doubts came and i
 returned to make sure so-laugh no
 more you are no longer under the pro-
 tection of the spirits instead-you shall
 be under my protection

   splendid the major drawled but
 could say no more for in response to mon-
 dara s curt order the four natives came for-
 ward and after gagging and blindfolding

                                                           
idols



him picked the major up and carried him
from the cave

   i think i am very clever eh profes-
sor mondara said complacently it is
very hard to pull the wool over my eyes
you have found that out i hope and if
youre wise youll use your influence to

jjersuade miss alice to-

   get out snapped the professor and
mondara first bowing- sarcastically has-
tened after the men who had taken the
major

   the professor and alice looked blankly
at each other

   our last state is worse than the first
the professor said nervously

   im not so sure i think the major
will find a way

   the professor smiled wearily

   youre putting your trust in a broken
reed alice he has courage and colossal
strength-youd never suspect that at a
casual glance-but thats all i dont be-
 lieve he has a brain in his head besides

 even if he had what could he do hell be
 put in a cave like this with men  guard
 night and day he has no weapons

i he-

   the girl shook her head

   you cant shake my confidence uncle
 im relying on the major dont know
u why-call it a womans intuition and
uncle isnt he frightfully handsome

 f- w he sun was hastening upon its
i westward course the valley of the
a crater was a place of purple shadows
as the shadows rose twilight gloom was
everywhere save that one ray of light from
 the setting sun shining through a gap in
i the western wall focussed on the stone
j image accentuating its bestial lines the
rred with which it was stained glowed like
jwarm freshly spilled blood

   the people of the crater were hastening
to a clearing directly below the idol as
 if at a signal they dropped to their knees
i their faces upturned toward the image and
 from a thousand throats came their chant
of supplication a prayer that their ambi-
tions might be quickly fulfilled the rock

ialls echoed with the mournful cadence
id the volume of sound seemed as if it
ust fill the whole universe

the sun sank lower the shaft of light
jw only illumined the idols face the
tick lips seemed to part in an under-
anding leer

the chant ended in a wild shout as the
ght totally vanished and the people de-

parted to their huts for them although
the sky above the towering snow-crowned
peaks was still a dazzling blue night had
commenced

the major groaned softly then sit-
ting erect with an effort tore the
filthy bandage from his eyes his
clothing hung upon him in shreds and his
back was scored with long livid weals-the
marks of a sjamboks lash

  presently when his eyes became accus-
tomed to the flickering light of the fire he
rose to his feet walked unsteadily to the
cave opening and peered out two na-
tives gripping assegais firmly in their right
hands were kneeling there their faces
turned toward the stone idol which was but
a few paces to the right from below
came the sound of a vast multitude chant-
ing

  cautiously the major stepped out onto
the narrow path he was possessed with
the idea of rushing the kneeling men ob-
taining their spears and selling his life as
dearly as possible suddenly the chant-
ing below ceased the two men jumped to
their feet and turned to face him they
menaced him with their spears and with
angry gestures indicated that he should re-
turn to the cave

  i intend  harm he said plaintively
in the language of one of the gold coast
tribes let me stay a while

  but they only scowled and advanced im-
placably upon him when the points of
their spears were but a few inches from
him he shrugged his shoulders and reen-
tered the cave

  this is a deuce of a mess he muttered
as he sat down beside the fire i wish

jim the bally old
blighter were
here things
wouldnt be so
bad then with-
out him im lost
absolutely he
sighed i won-
der whats hap-
pened to the dear
old chap  some-
how i dont think

are alive i should say that the people
who run this little affair are not exactly
bloodthirsty if we could only eliminate
the mondara chappie id be willing to gam-
ble that i could get us all out of the mess as
easy as wink

  he rose to his feet and paced slowly up

and down	

  yes he continued mondara must

   eliminated and theres very little time in
which to do it of course if hes jelling
the truth he leaves here in two clays time
but first i think he will eliminate us-and
 hats not so good and he plans to take
miss alice by force u she wont go will-
ing v and she wont of course so
there are two good reasons why mr mon-
dara must not go-or why we should go
first yes i think that would he best
but there are a lot of obstacles in the way
-a frightful lot and i want to see this
reputed solomons treasure and- his
voice sharpened-i want to teach mon-
dara that it is not wise to sjambok a white
man

  hes cunning he had me carried for
miles an miles then he sjamboked me
then more traveling-blindfolded all the
time and yet here i am now in a cave
not a hundred feet from that which im-
prisons miss alice and the professor did
i say mondara was cunning hes not
hes a fool trying to make me think that
i was miles awav from the others when a
moments thought must have shown him
that the idol was a dead give away of my lo-
cation oh well even if the other two
dear souls are only just the other side of
the idol they might as well be the other
-ide of the world for all the chance i have
of getting in touch with them

  the entrance of two native women es-
corted by the guards ut an end to his cogi-
tations one of the women carried a plat-
ter heaped high with food and a large
rourd full of water the other had a
pile of faggots for the fire they placed
their burdens on the ground and retired
grinning sheepishly at the majors fulsome
compliments

  at least he mused as he sat down to
cat they dont intend to starve me this
chicken-

  for a time the business of eating fully
occupied him

   and that he said at length with a sigh
ot satisfaction he had been very hungry

 stm imy pnt we are not meant to
be killed it is undoubtedly the order of
the head johnnies that we are to be well
treated

   he shivered

  phew its getting cold the sun
must have set

   he put a couple of sticks on the fire an-
other he held in his hand balancing it
thoughtfully	

  it looks as if mondara must be killed

he muttered and ive used worse weap-
ons than this he sat staring morosely
at the lire endeavoring to find a way out
of the difficulties which emhogged him

  l ime passed swiftly but the major did
not move did not shift his gaze from the
lire unshaven his hair in disorder his
clothing dirty and tom there was little
about him to suggest the monocled im-
maculate dude which was his well culti
vated pose only the well trained observer
would have been aware of the colossah
strength stored in his relaxed frame of the
fighting spirit indicated by his firm we
shaped chin and of the keen brain whic
worked behind the mild vacuous appeann
blue eyes

  he rose suddenly and taking a light
brand from the fire explored the walls n
his prison cave

  at one point there was a wide crack
the wall he passed his improvised torch
through it and found that it was wi
enough and deep enough to admit thfc
length of his arm shielding his eyes fn 
the wood smoke which drifted back froi
his torch he squinted through tlie cradl
the rock wall he judged was near
two feet thick and beyond was anothci
cave or-or a passageway

  and if its a cave he mused as he re
turned to the fire then its opening mu
be partly concealed by the idol and if itj
a passageway-it may lead to the treasut
mondara was talking about better than
that it may lead straight through

mountain and-

  he closed his eyes realizing that lie wa
too tired to marshal his thoughts properly
and he was too wise to indulge in vague
wonderings

  tomorrow he muttered sleepily i
investigate but now i must relax  there

nothing i can do there-

  his voice trailed off into silence h
head dropped lower his chin rested on h
up-drawn knees and he slept as a native
sleeps slept with every sense on guard t
warn him of the approach of danger
time passed

  then a voice sounded in the cave
ghostly whisper of a voice seeming t
emanate from the crack

  baas it said baas

that same morning jim the ho
tentot awakened tardily from sleep
rising to his feet he gazed vacanil
first at the swiftly rising sun then at the

j
  

idols



  dying ashes of the fire and the deserted
  camp

 baas he cried and when the empty
 echo of his own voice was the only an-
 swer he grinned sheepishly because i
 have slept overlong he muttered the
 baas plays a game with me he shook
 his head doubtfully as he eyed the loads
 left by the deserting carriers i will wait
 here he presently decided and cook my-
 self food he will send someone back for

 these loads
 then for the
 first time he was
 conscious that
 he was gripping
 something tight-
 ly in his hand
 he opened his
 fingers and look-
 ed at the little
 red idol and his
 expression o f
 disgust as he suddenly threw the thing
 i from him was almost comical in its inten-
  sity

a cloud of gray ashes leaped upward as

 	the idol dropped into the midst of the
 ci smoldering fire

   with a cry the hottentot ran forward
 ti raked the idol from the fire with his fin-
  gers carefully brushed the ashes from it
 r and secreted it amongst the tangled mop

 -	of his hair

 the baas would not like it burnt he
 muttered as he walked restlessly up and
 down listening intently for any sound
 which would give him a clue as to the
 whereabouts of his baas and the carriers
 after a while -with a self-condemning
  grunt of disgust he examined the ground
 h all about and there read the story of the
 a carriers departure

 i am a fool he grumbled i should
 a have known wo-we the sleep spirits

 -	must have bound me fast the carriers-
  mashona dogs that they are-have started
 i back on the long trek to their kraals au-a
 fi may they die on the way but i should

 	have remembered i should not have slept

 i	i should have kept watch with the baas
 a yesterday they said they would go-and i
 t slept while they departed but my baas
 i where is he 

     do not see his spoor here he con-
  tinued ivo-we and all the time i
  lept

   he scrutinized the ground even more
  closely stooping over almost double up
  and down he went following the majors
  restless pacing of the night until finally

he came to the spot where darkness had
suddenly descended upon the major

  little more than a casual glance was suf-
ficient to show him all that had happened
and greatly distressed he returned to the
fire and squatting down on his haunches
gazed blankly before him at that mo-
ment he wished that death might come to
him now that his baas had gone his
baas who could do no wrong there was
nothing to live for for many years they
had played the game together-hunting
exploring welded together in that bond
of sympathy which nature weaves about
men-irrespective of color-who are men

  wo-wei jim moaned

  his baas had been captured by followers
of the little red idol they had crept up
close whilst he-jim the hottentot-slept
worse yet-they had probably crept up
close during his watch and had bided their
time not moving doing nothing to betray
their presence to the white man when he
corfimenced his watch

  wo-we jim said again and i told
the baas that there was nothing to fear
yet i must have slept during my watch
they could not have creot up without the
baas hearing them and they were so
close that he had no time even to utter one
cry of warning

  then came a thought which lightened
his mood of despair the little red idol
probably the baas had left that with him
as a sign that he was to follow probably
the baas had gone off willingly with the fol-
lowers of the idol at least they had not
raided the camp they had not been respon-
sible for the carriers desertion they had
not harmed him then it might be the
major was still alive

  the hottentot put some more wood onto
the fire blowing on the embers until the
new fuel burst into flame then opening
certain of the packs he methodically cooked
himself some food which he ate median-
ically he was storing up vitality for the
unknown trek before him

  his hunger satisfied he took two revol-
vers and a belt of cartridges from one of
the packs and strapped them about him
a long coil of rope he carried about his
shoulders the rest of the packs he ar-
ranged in an orderly pile and covered them
with branches and armfuls of the long
grass which had served as his baas bed
weighting it down with heavy boulders

  then from his own little store of things
he selected a large hunting knife which he
stuck in the cartridge belt sadly discarded
the blankets and set out on the trail
o

  picking up the spoor of the unknown
abductors jim the hottentot followed it
at a fast pace straight uphill it went fol-
lowing as jim presently perceived a
faintly defined trail even so the trek-
king was difficult and jim was frequently
forced to call a halt the trail was so
steep in places that he liad difficulty in
keeping his footing

  it was nearly noon when he came to a
large barren plateau jutting out from the
mountain there the trail was clearer and
he was able to go at a faster pace an
hour later when he had crossed the pla-
teau he was faced by a steep unclimbable
wall of rock in despair he searched the
wind polished surface for signs of foot-
hold but found none neither could he see
any further signs of the trail of the men
he followed

  the path-if path it could be called-
vanished at a small clump of stunted
bushes at that point his baas and the men
who had carried him had apparently dis-
solved into nothingness

  with unflagging energy jim cast about
in ever widening circles endeavoring to
pick up the spoor again cheering himself
with the memories of other adventures he
and his baas had shared adventures which
had brought them face to face with death
-yet they had always won through

  and we will be too cunning for death
this time jim shouted challengingly

  the wind which howled continually
about the plateau with an almost gale-like
velocity snatched the words from his
mouth splitting them up into incoherent
syllables casting them into an abyss of si-
lence jim shivered and vaguely com-
pared himself to a morsel of dirt upon the
peak of the world

  he had returned now to the place where
he had lost the trail was standing close to
the clump of bushes suddenly with a
sheepish grin at his own stupidity he
parted the bushes and uttered a soft cry of
triumph swiftly uncoiling his rope he
fastened one end securely about a large
boulder and tying a good sized stone to
the other end threw it into the gaping hole
the bushes concealed

  before half the length of the rope snaked
into the hole a rocky clatter told him that
the stone had reached bottom and without
turt her hesitation he slid down the rope

  the bottom reached he was challenged
by a native who loomed up in the twilight
gloom of the place like a creature of the
nether world

he liad formulated a plan of action

  i come on the business of this one lie
said and taking the idol from his hair liel
it out on the palm of his hand

  the other swiftly examined it hande
it back and then lighted a torch in the
embers which glowed fitfully in a sma
brazier

  the way is before you he said as
handed the torch to jim and sat down be
side the brazier having apparently no fur
ther interest in the matter

  jim looked at him uneasily somethin
warned him that he was not to win throng
so easily he edged closer to the sent
his hand on the hilt of his hunting knift
his eyes had now become accustomed
the yellow light of the torch and he sa
that he was in a circular highroofed cave
shafts led off from it in all directions

  which road do i take he asked gruf
ly and went still closer to the sentry

  the other laughed mockingly j

  if you were sent on that ones bus
ness he said the road was made knen
to you

  i was not told or if i was told i
forgotten jim said dully so show
the road i take i have the idol

  aye so you have but that alone
not enough wthat is its voice wli

  jim looked about the place seeking sor
clue which would indicate which shaft
should take but they all looked alike
there were no distinguishing marks beads
of sweat rolled down the hottentots fac
he was horribly afraid not for himself

 but for the safety of his baas if he

 failed now-

    that is the one i will take he said with
 i a show of confidence and pointed to an
 opening in order to gain access to it he
 would have to pass very close to the sen-

 i	tty

   you choose well the other grunted
 but jim detected a note of malicious tri-
 umph in the mans voice

    whistling softly jim walked toward it
 but as he was about to pass the sentry he
 drew his knife and leaped upon him

   over and over they rolled struggling
 furiously the sentry was strong but
 jim was stronger

    tf you kill me the man gasped jims
 knife pricking at his throat what good
 will that do you let me up and i will
  tell you the proper road

    get up then jim panted triumphantly
 and see that you make no sound

   silently the other obeyed turning his
 hack to jim as that man directed holding
 i his hands out behind him

    jim cut a length off the rope and tied the
  mans hands together

   now he said as he lighted another
 j torch show me the road

   it is that one the man nodded to-
  ward a shaft directly opposite the one jim
 i had selected

   so-o then you shall go ahead of me
 r and lead me to its end and remember i
  shall be very close behind you holding the

 	rope which binds you the point of my knife
 --it is very sharp-pressed between your

 shoulder blades now lead on-and play
  no tricks

    he pricked the other with his knife urg-
 ing him on

   nay hottentot the man gasped i
 lied that way is strewn with poison
  thorns that way is death

   au-ci said jim then show me the

 	right way

    the other hesitated then shrugging his
  shoulders it is that one he said and
  walked unhesitatingly toward the shaft di-
 rectly to the left of the one he had first in-
 dicated wait jim said and yanked

 ii	hard on the rope he held causing the man
 r to fall over backward

    quickly jim tightened his bonds passing
 r the rope around his feet so that the sentry
 was helpless incapable of moving

    now bite on this he said and thrust a
 gag between his jaws

    i will release you when i return-if i
 return jim said as he dragged the man a
  little distance along one of the shafts

  then taking a bundle of torches with
him he went boldly forward

  for what seemed an endless time he fol-
lowed the winding tunneled passage mar-
veling at the ivory smoothness of the walls
-as if polished by countless million hands

  mostly im going toward the direction
of the setting sun jim muttered it
may be that this road will take me to the
place where the sun buries itself with the
coming of night it may be that this leads
to the place of the wicked dead he shiv-
ered at the thought of it but at least
he comforted himself the man who kept
watch was no spirit-but a poor guard

  one by one his stock of torches burned
down and out he had only one left and
that half consumed when he came to a
wide ravine which was spanned by a flimsy
rope bridge the ravine actually it was
a wide crack in the rock caused by some
upheaval of nature-extended for an enor-
mous distance

  far overhead jim could see a tiny patch
of sky

  dubiously he tested the bridge then
started to cross it swayed sickeningly
to and fro and when he was but halfway
across he lost hold of his torch

  almost nauseated by giddiness he
watched the tiny point of flame drop into
the darkness below watched it until it van-
ished he listened intently but no sound
came up out of the depths and he visualized
it falling for all eternity

  his hold on the ropes stiffened and he
clung there afraid to move it seemed to
him that many seasons came and went be-
fore courage returned to him and he moved
slowly forward

  when he readied the solid ground again
he crept forward on hands and knees al-
most sobbing with relief yet not daring to
stop until he had put several hundred paces
between himself and the bottomless horror
of the pit had he known there was a
store of torches and food hidden in a niche
in the wall close by

  then on again very slowly feeling his
way cautiously forward inch by daring
inch endeavoring to make his eyes pierce
the darkness

   he lost all thought of time all awareness
of self he rememoered only that his baas
-the man he worshipped with an almost
idolatrous zeal-was somewhere ahead
he was subconsciously aware that the tun-
nel was sloping upward his naked feet
could feel the steps which had been cut

into the rock

  the tunnel suddenly leveled out again


short stories

and jim with a feeling of relief realized

that the darkness was not so intense

  a tongue of flame shot out from the wall
ahead it moved mysteriously to and fro
up and down then as mysteriously disap-
peared-seemed to have been swallowed
up by the rock	

  with a groan of fear jim dropped to his
knees and covered his face with his hands
he was sure that he had seen a manifesta-
tion of the spirits presently summoning
up courage though he could not silence the
chattering of his teeth he rose and went
on after a while and never had his pace
been so slow he came to a place where
there was a crack in the left hand wall of
the tunnel through which straggled a shaft
of light

  greatly daring jim crept up to it and
peered through at first he could distin-
guish nothing then he saw his baas sitting
beside a fire but his great joy did not de-
stroy his caution

  baas he called softly then when
the major did not move called in a little
louder tone o-he baas

  he chuclded with delight as his baas
opened his eyes and stretched himself
wearily he did not call again he knew
that his baas had heard that his pregnant
call had penetrated beyond the outerguard
of sleep

  casually the major rose put more wood
on the fire glanced toward the opening of
the cave-he could see the sentries outside

they were sitting
with their backs
to him-then went
to the crack

  jim he whis-
pered happily is
it really you 

  a ye baas
none other are
you all r i g h t
baas no harm
has come to you 
i am all right jim save that a sjambok
scored my back

  there shall be an accounting for that 
jim said fiercely

	jim  major cau-

tioned you brought guns

  aye baas two

  jim passed the revolvers and cartridge
belt through the crack with a sigh of relief
jim did not like firearms as the major
buckled the weapons about him under his
clothing he chuckled gleefully their
possession put escape into his liands

  one of the sentries peered into the cave

then rejoining his companion announced
the white man is mad he stands by
the wall laughing to himself he will
give us no trouble let us sleep

  how do i get into that place where you
 now are baas jim asked or how do
 you get out  he strained at the sides of
 the crack as if he would rend tlie rock still
 farther apart

  it cannot be done that way jim thel
 major said but we will find a wayi
 there is  great need of haste now tdlj
 me how you come to this place but first
 -are you hungry

  what is meat to me now that i know
you live baas the hottentot replied hap-
pily yet nevertheless i could eat a lit-
tle

  the major laughed softly and brought
over from the fire the remains of his eve-
ning meal which he passed through the
crack to jim while the hottentot ate
the major gave him a full account of his 
experiences

  au-a exclaimed jim the end of tlie
 majors narrative coinciding with the last
 crumb of food and it is all my fault

if i had not slept-

  there is no fault jim doubtless if
they had not captured me we would nova
be on our way south again my mission 
failure as it is- but my voice growa
tired tell me then of your journeyt
mgs

  it is a long trail and where shall fl

 start 

  where is the red idol i left beside

 you 

  jim grinned

   i threw it in the fire baas

 teh the major clicked reprovingly 
 and then i took it out of the fire un-
 harmed baas and it is well i did it

is a powerful charm it-

  and for a time jims deep voice rumbled 
  describing in great detail his manifold
 adventures

 that is all baas he finally concluded
 and now we will go back the way i cainejj
 let us start now i like not this place
 and think you jim that i can squeeze
 through this crack

  i had forgotten that then must we
stay here until death comes

  the way is open for you to return
jim

  the way is closed unless you are with
 me baas such talk is folly the hot-
 tentot growled

  tlie majors eyes glowed

   did the carriers take all the packs with

                                                          jo

them jim he asked lightly concealing
ihc emotion be felt at jims fresh demon-
stration of loyalty

   kay baas only the ones containing
their food

   the major nodded and rubbed his chin
reflectively

   im glad of that he drawled in eng-
lish im beastly dirty and i need a shave
besides i feel quite lost without my mon-
ocle that mondara smashed it to smith-
ereens with his sjambok ah im afraid
he will have to pay for that oh quite
and so considering that i need so many
things i think the sooner we get out of this
place the better i think perhaps if all
things go in our favor we will go tonight
not a bit of good waiting about and it
should be quite simple-quite i imagine
the passage jims in comes out by the stone
idol so-all i have to do is shoot the sen-
tries outside my cave and the sentries out-
side the professors and just amble along
but i dont like that idea very much

   the sentries are quite good sorts really
and killing them would be such a messy
affair besides the reports would give the
alarm and i couldnt shoot the whole
bloomin population of the crater no
weve got to get away quietly and i
want to take mister bloomin mondara
along with us hes our only real danger
hes civilized-probably has rifles and re-
volvers and what not so he must come
along with us res for the good of his soul
he must come along he must be taught
 a few things and thats not all pon my
soul no this expedition has cost me a
deuce of a lot of money i must reimburse
myself somehow dont you think so
jim	

   golly -yes baas if i dont see
you slong hullo jim stammered not un-
 derstanding a word of what the major had
said answering the interrogative note in his
i- baas voice

   i thought you would say that old top
r the major drawled then in the vernacu-
lar now go to the end of the passage and
t find when it comes out also look for a
r crack in the wall opposite

   jim departed returning almost imme-
i diately greatly excited

   the passage ends less than a spears
if throw from here baas he reported be-
i tween the idols legs is the opening the
i light from the fires of the watchers showed
rf me that and there is a crack in the wall
 opposite but it is not so big as this one
 it is only a small crack i could only just
j see through it i looked and saw the

white woman and the old white man they
were sitting by the fire looking as if death
was very close to them

  it was jim until you came death
was close to all of us but you have
frightened death away so now there is
no cause for fear and now what

   his brows knit in puzzled thought

  i have no paper no pencil-nothing by
which i can write a message he muttered
ill have to trust it to jim i hope theyll
have the sense to listen to him i think
they will at least miss alice will shes
splendid she- aloud he said listen
jim you must go to the other crack and
make the girl or the man come to speak
with you here take this- he passed a
thin stick through to jim-and wave it
to and fro until they see it then whisper
their names missy alice-professor-
over and over again until they come to the
crack say their names

   missy alley pfessor jim said halt-
ingly

  the major nodded

  that will do then jim when they
have come to the crack you will tell them
this

  and slowly making jim repeat sentence
after sentence the major outlined the first
steps of the scheme which would he hoped
end in escape from the crater

   now tell me he said finally just as
you are going to tell them all that i have
said and speak slowly for their knowl-
edge of the vernacular is not good

  jim nodded and began

   i am jim i am the majors right hand 
i am his mouth this is what he says to
you before the rising of the morrows
sun we will all leave this place in safety
but first you missy alley must play a
part call now for the man mondara if
you make much noise shouting his name
the sentry will send for him then when
he comes this is the meat of what you
must say to him

   i have been thinking many things
mondara it is better to live even as your
slave than to die i am young  desire to
live i desire much wealth much wealth
would make me forget maybe that your
skin is black so i am almost ready to
fulfill your condition and go with you
freely but how can i believe that you are
rich go bring me proof now that you
have all manner of precious stones as you
have boasted if i am satisfied that you
do not lie then i promise you i will go
forth from this place with you-and that
freely


  that is what my baas says you must
sav missy allcv and you pfessor my

baas the major
says that you must
forbid the girl to
do as she says
you must be an-
gry with her

  then after
mondara has de-
parted  will
come again with
further word
from my baas
jim looked at the major

  have i the message right he asked
quite jim your words are the echo
of mine go now and see what you can
do

  when jim had departed on his mission
the major paced restlessly up and down
presently he sat down close to the crack
and endeavored to eject his personality into
the other cave commanding its occupants
to listen to the voice of jim

  time passed dragged wearily

  o-he baas

  he roused himself at jims excited whis-
per

  well jim he asked

  she will do it baas the hottentot
said even now she makes ready at
first they would have none of my story
the old man said t was a liar he said
 was one of mondaras men trying to trap
them but the girl said i was a true man
but first she made me repeat the words the
baas put into my mouth many times there
listen baas she calls now

  faintly muffled by the walls of the cave
the major heard the girl calling mon-
dara mondara

  he chuckled with satisfaction

  keep a close lookout jim he ordered
he may come by the passage if he does

-	you have a knife

  aye i have a knife baas jim an-
swered grimly

     hen you will know what to do do
not kill him unless that cant be avoided
but do not let him call for aid watch
now i go to the opening of my cave to
see what is to be seen

  as the major came to his caves open-
ing the girl s voice sounded louder clearer
mondara mondara

  the sentries before her cave were ap-
parently trying to silence her with threats
whilst the men who kept guard over him
were grumbling loudly because their sleep
had been disturbed

  go get mondara one of them shout
he will silence her

  a noisy altercation followed and th
the major saw one of the guards rise a
make his way swiftly down the narrow pa
leading to the crater below

  after a time-the major judged a hal
hour had passed-the guard returned ho
ing aloft a flaming torch and behind hi
was mondara

  well satisfied the major retreated
into his cave and seated himself abj
before the fire nevertheless it was on
by the exercise of magnificent self-contr
that he was able to refrain from rushi
out and fighting his way to the other ca
he was nervous for the girls safety h
afraid that she would betray unwitting
the existence of jim

  someone entered his cave and ca
slowly toward him he knew it was
dara and was halt determined to bring mat
ters to an issue there and then his bett
judgment however ruled otherwise
must wait a little longer

  and how is the mad mr aubrey
john major mondara drawled inoc
ingly

  the major sprang to his feet ss i
greatly alarmed

  when did you come in  he gasped 
must have been asleep i- then
drawl came into his voice again i t
it that you have come to release me f
this hole eh frightfully good of yo
but let me tell you i shall report yo
beastly behavior to the authorities

  mondaras eyes gleamed

  you are a fool he said in a contempt
ous tone i just came to tell you that t
morrow i leave this place and the girl g
with me of her own free will in less than
a month i shall be on board ship headin
for paris after that- he shrugge
his shoulders

  but youll take me with you the ma
jor pleaded you wouldnt leave me he
to die in this hole why-

  no i wont leave you here to die 
shall kill you before i go

  he turned abruptly on his heel and left
the cave

  baas it was jim at the crack again
the major crossed over quickly

  well jim

  missy alley she says that mondara
has gone to get the proof of his wealth
in a little while he will return she now
wants to know what she must do when he
comes again

  tell her jim that she must make a

 ihow of being well satisfied with what she
 ees tell her to speak soft words to
 iondara tell her to make him many soft
 promises if need e but she must send
 lim away quickly tell her to tell him
 hat she must sleep in order to be ready for
 i lie morrows trek say that to her and
 hen come back here to me

  when jim returned to report that he had

 	lelivered the message he saw the major

	nd arms and face

 with the charred
 end of a piece of
 wood

  is the baas
 mad  he gasped

  n ay j i m
 only for a little
 while i desire to
 ass as one of the
 sentries

  then the baas
 is indeed mad as
  the black char from a piece of burned
 rood could make him black au-a does
  lat thicken his lips change the color of
 t is eyes and hair break down the bridge
 f his nose what folly and there are
 jither tilings-

  what i do is enough jim it is only to

 	bol a man whose eyes are blinded by his
 vivn splendor he will not look at me
 cosely-until it is too late why should
 e suspecting nothing he will see noth-
 ig now jim i go to take my stand
 car to the entrance of this my cave and
 nu will shout-putting your lips to this
  -ack-afonn-akat-chang-obbaiv-cliang v 
  wtiat is it baas jim asked wonder-
 rgly after he had muttered the words to
  mself a charm

  a most powerful charm jim i think

 	will bring the guards running to see
 vhat it is all about but shout the words
 ttadly and let there be fear in your voice
 i hear but i do not understand jim
  uttered and he repeated the words softly
 i himself as he peered anxiously through
 e crack

  the major put more wood on the fire
   st dampening it with water from a gourd
  e flames died down vaguely through
  rmids of smoke jim saw his baas take up
  fiosition to the right of the caves opening
  d then he grinned as understanding
  rflne to him his baas was holding a re-
  wver in his hand he was crouching
  fflhtly on the balls of his feet he was
  ady to strike

    atnn-alal-fkarn-olhavi-fkant literally cliild-frcl-nnt-
     not the thing without hands or led name given by
    no wmi cojt tribes to snakes-particularly python

  jim wailed his charm dolorously and re-
peated the phrase again and yet again
there was fear loathing arid an appeal
for help in his voice outside the two
guards held a hasty consultation then-
had not mondara expressly ordered that
 harm was to come to the white man yet
-they rushed into the hut

  the first passed the major before he
could strike heading for that part of the
dimly lit cave from which came the shout
of fear the second man went down like
a pole-axed bullock as the major brought
down the long barrel of his revolver on
his head

  the snake is here warrior the major
said quietly as the other turned at the thud
of his companions fall drop your
spear

  the man looked at him with a grotesque
air of bewilderment he was convinced
that the white man was in league with the
spirits the voice had sounded from over
there nowhere near where the white man
was standing and there was no one else
in the cave then the voice must have
been that of one of the spirits even so
the warrior was of a mind to try conclu-
sions with the major for the moment he
feared the spirits less than he feared the
wrath of mondara

  he shortened his hold on his assegai and
crept stealthily forward

  stand the major ordered sharply and
cursed under his breath when the native
still came forward

  he knew that the warriors life was in
his hands he had only to squeeze the
trigger of his revolver and the stalwart
menacing form would be lifeless flesh and
bone but apart from the fact that tlie
major knew the report would raise an
alarm and bring others to the attack-thus
ruining his plan of escape-he was averse

o	killing

  the warrior was very near now his hand
was going slowly back in a moment the
major knew he would rush in to the at-
tack and then a weird moaning noise
came from the crack the warrior turned
in alarm and at that moment the major
closed in  him

  the struggle that ensued was a very
short one the majors strength was
more than a match for the warriors-
giant of a man though he was-and be-
sides the native was defeated already by
superstitious fear in a very little while
the major had him down on the floor of
the cave gagged and bound with the same
ropes that early in tlie day had bound
short stories

him rising from his task he saw that
tim was performing a like task with the
other native who was beginning to show
signs of returning consciousness

  and now what baas the hottentot
asked happily directly after his cry
which had taken the warrior off his guard
he had emerged from the passageway and
entered the cave at its entrance

  now said the major we will go out-
side and play that we are the guards

  a few moments later they were squat-
ting on their haunches beside the fire out-
side the cave they were enveloped from
head to foot in skin blankets

  presently there was a sound of booted
feet coming up the steep path and a mo-
ment later mondara came into sight he
had no torch and in his hands he carried a
large tin money box he walked fur-
tively continually looking over his shoul-
der as if afraid of being followed when
he came still nearer and full into the cir-
cle of light thrown by the fire the major
saw that his face was strained the pupils
of his eyes dilated and that beads of sweat
stood out on his forehead

  the major pulled his skin blanket closer
about him under its cover he held his
revolver ready for use

  dogs mondara said angrily as he
neared do you dare to sit in my pres-
ence i-

  he turned suddenly and drawing his re-
volver aimed at some invisible point in the
darkness beyond the fire gleam so he
stood for a moment and then shrugging his
shoulders as if in derision at vague half
formed fears he hurried on rounding the
angle made by the stone image and van-
ished from sight

   i wonder what was the matter with the
blighter the major mused he acted
as if he were afraid of being followed
shouldnt be at all surprised if he hadnt
robbed the treasury as it were and is
afraid that they are on his trail perhaps
i should have tackled him then-but no i

think not on his return though-

  they waited for a while in a silence so
profound that jim was afraid the beating
of his heart must be heard by the inhabi-
tants of all the world then from the
cave on the other side of the stone image
came a confuscd murmur of voices a
womans voice soft almost caressing
and then the voice of mondara shrill
blatantly triumphant

good night miss alice they heard
him say tomorrow then at sunrise
the major and jim arose to their feet

and crept nearer to the stone image

  they heard mondara exchange a cmdi
jest with the guards and then the soui
of his footsteps coming toward them

  suddenly down in the valley of the cnue
there sounded the deep menacing boom i
drums lights flickered about the valley

vhrtll voices sounded giving orders th
lights massed together advanced towa
the cliff the next moment momla
rushed hastily round the idol directly in
the arms of the major and jim who we
waiting for him

  he was badly frightened and liad en-
tirely lost his self-possession

  let me go let me go he screamed
the vernacular they have found me oti
let me go

  he clawed at them with his naked hatu
in his terror he had forgotten all about
revolver and the thin veneer of dvilizati
had entirely gone from him he vas no
only a puny badly frightened savage

  let me go he cried again  it
have found it out

  found what out the major asked qt
etlv also in the vernacular and he sho
mondara much as a terrier shakes a rat

  i killed the keeper of the treasury
mondara gasped and now the gfl
ones have set the avengers on my trai
let me go before it is too late

  hold him jim the major said tertf
and leaving mondara in the firm grasps
the hottentot the major made his va
along the path to the other cave that
he was confronted by the two guards vi
watched over the cave in which the prorefr
sor and the girl were imprisoned the
menaced him with their spears but back
at the sight of the revolver in his han
hacked at his order into the cave th
hands held high above their heads t
professor and the girl ran to greet the m
jor with exclamations of gratitude ai
wonder they showered him with
tions

  there is no time for explanations nov
he said roughly bind these two jota
nies professor and then we will have
run	

  it was quickly done and as quickly the


idols

 ft the cave hastening hack to where jim
 id mondara awaited them the shouts
  the people sounded nearer the place was
 luminated by the gleam of many torches
 hurry hurry mondara almost
 reamed in a little while it will be too

let him go jim the major ordered
ind see that you keep close to his heels
as jim released his hold mondara
i irted through the widespread legs of the
i nage and was immediately lost to sight
the blackness of the passage beyond
with a cry of follow swiftly baas
e path is smooth the hottentot hastened
ter him

 follow jim the major said to alice
 id the professor i will bring up the

ar

the major was about to follow them
hen a spear whizzed by his head the
rlajor fired swiftly at the onrushing war-
 ors checking them and then sped hastily

 	rough the black depths of the tunnel
 atching up with the professor and alice
 tising their nearness in the gloom he
ged them to better speed

 ahead of them was the blackness of the
 it behind them the warriors yelling fierce
 reats their torches stabbing the darkness
 ith points of yellow light an assegai
 uttered on the rock just behind the ma-

  you and alice go on the professor
 isped i am all in let me have a revol-
 t and ill hold them back

 the majors answer was to pick up the
  tie man in his arms and with a curt
 i arry on to the girl they continued their
 ght to the professor he gave one of
 s revolvers and his burden fired at inter-
 ls whenever a yelling warrior came to

 o	close quarters ahead of them they
 i uld hear the shrill piping voice of mon-
 ra the deep booming voice of jim the
 tottentot echoed back strangely in the dim
 i died passage like the roar of a maddened
 j behind them sounded the fierce cries
 the pursuing warriors the fumes of
 awder mixing with the smoke from the
 ches stung their nostrils

  at last they caught up to jim the hot-
  not

 is mondara with you the majoi-
 ned

 ya baas jim said grimly at first
  was very fast but once i had caught up
 flth him the rest was easy not once has
 e point of my knife been farther than a
 urs breadth from the great vein in his
 ftk

  good the major said tersely keep
it there and the tin box where is
that

   mondara carries it jim answered

  the pursuers seemed to have slackened
their speed and were falling farther be-
hind undoubtedly the professors shoot-
ing erratic though it was had greatly dis-
couraged them

  and that is a good thing said jim
for soon we come to the bridge i told you
of and i do not want to hurry over that

  as he spoke mondara stumbled and fell
to his hands and knees jim groped
through the darkness after him but in
vain crawling several paces on his hands
and knees mondara had evaded him and
then rising to his feet ran forward at
full speed his mocking laugh came back
to them through the darkness

  i will get him baas jim cried and
hastened forward a few minutes later
a tiny flame of light appeared ahead of
them and they saw that mondara with a
lighted torch in his hand was halfway
across the rope bridge w ithout any hesi-
tation jim started to cross too making the
bridge swing precariously

  back mondara snarled and aimed his
revolver full at the hottentot but just as
he was about to press the trigger jim
jumped violently up and down the fran-
tic swaying caused mondara to drop the
tin box in his endeavor to retain his bal-
ance with a cry of rage mondara fired
three shots in rapid succession two of
the shots went wide but the third seared
jims ribs and the shock of it almost caused
him to lose his hold before mondara
could fire again the majors revolver
spoke and mondara hung limply for a
moment to the ropes and then gradually
almost imperceptibly his stiffened fingers
opened and with a wild animal-like scream
he dropped into the pit for a little while
they could follow his fall lightened by the
flame of the torch then it too vanished
and they were left once again in the dark-
ness

  are you all right jim the major
asked anxiously

  ya baas jim replied mournfully
only once again im at fault mondara
has escaped me and he has taken the stones
with him

  the major laughed happily the po-
tential wealth the tin box had contained
meant nothing less than nothing when
weighed in the balance with the safety of

jim		 i

  they are coming major the girl


short stories

warned and the major with a startled look
over his shoulder saw that the pursuers
were very near he fired rapidly aiming
at the ground lefore them he liad no
desire to kill the tunnel was filled with
the whine of bullets

  is the bridge sate jim he asked

  ya baas and it is easier to cross it
in the dark than with a light in the dark
one cannot see what will happen if a foot
goes astray im now on the other side
come quickly

  a few moments later the girl had crossed
in safety and the major with the professor
now on his back had also made the dan-
gerous crossing

  almost as soon as the majors feet had
reached the solid ground jim hacked away
at the main ropes supporting the bridge

  this is quicker jim said the ma-
jor and fired point blank at the thick
strands they parted and the bridge drop-
ped uselesslyhanging to its stays on the
opposite side

  now ve can go on at our own pace
the major announced gaily and laughed at
the infuriated yells of the warriors whose
farther progress was halted by the broken
bridge

  go back to the great ones the major
shouted in the language of the natives
tell them their secret is safe with us so
long as they refrain from deeds of blood-
shed

  our quarrel is not with you a war-
rior answered but with mondara-the
dog he killed the keeper of the treasure
he-

  he will work no more evil the ma-
jor answered gravely if this pit has a
bottom-look for him there there you
will find him and the things he stole

it was sunrise jim the hottentot
squatted by the campfire cooking the
morning meal from the frying-pan
came the pleasing odor of bacon a coffee
pot simmered nearby wrapped in blan-
kets not far away the girl and her uncle
slept peacefully

  presently a cheerful whistle sounded be-
yond the bushes which fringed the camp
clearing and the major appeared he was
clean-shaved and dressed immaculately

do they still sleep jim he asked 
a baas not even the smell of food
wakens them they must re tired indeed

  without doubt the major said but
what of you you old heathen are you never
tired are you not tired now

   why should  be i have done nothin
   the major jaughed

   no he drawled in english you
 done nothing all you have done is tt
 save my life and the life of miss alice an
 the professor

   then in the vernacular jim

   ya baas

   where is the little red idol

   jim fumbled in the tangled mop of h
 hair and from it took the little wood
 image which had first set their feet on t
 trail which led them to the mountains
 the moon he spat in disgust as he h
 it out to the major on the palm of his han
 i do not want it jim the major sai
 keep it it is your reward

   jim spat again and then threw the
 into the fire

   so may all evil end baas he said
 a happy grin

   the major nodded

   when did the carriers leave this place
 he asked jim

   yesterday morning before sunn
 baas but yesterday morning seems
 ten thousand years ago

   nevertheless jim the major respon
 ed with a chuckle it was only yes ten
 morning and if we hurry traveling 
 we may catch up with them

   that was in my thoughts too baasj
  and once we have caught up w
 them the major continued i can p
 suade some of them to return here for
 rest of the packs

   when the baas persuades no one 
 say him nay jim said

   exactly after that-the rest will
 easy

   but what is the rest jim asked anx
 iously

   we take the miss alice and her u
 to a white mans settlement

 and after that baas after th
 wfhy after that jim we will wan
 up and down this land sleeping where
 night finds us eating whatever may fall

our guns living-	j

   ya baas jim interrupted tl
 is living but we will come no more i
 this place of cold winds and bottomh
 pits

   no jim where the wind blows th
 we will go

   and we will play the game baas
 jim meant the game of i d b

  mabe jim who knows b
without doubt we will play whatever ganl
is set before us

       the story of high days on the high seas the deep sea tradi-
       tion as shown by the little skipper of a yankee clipper and
       the single-track mind of the farmer among his crew

t aint fitten for a hog ter eat said
bennett and looked from man to
man around the circle of sailors gath-
ered in the focsle of the ship jvin-
throp for the midday meal each
i ad a wooden mess kid between his knees
nd a spoon in his hand but none as yet
ad made a move to eat the cracker hash
ipped from the big mess kid made of a
 utter tub sawed in half that stood in the
nter of the deck

 a hog no tier a skunk nuther couldnt
i-and ther smell pronounced bennett in a

	asal new hampshire drawl when he saw
is shipmates agreed with him ordinarily
jjsse big slow-moving sailor had little to
ny he had left his fathers farm eigh-
ten months before in the spring of 
nd shipped aboard the ivinthrop as a
rreenhorn a voyage around the horn to
iie mouth of the columbia river for furs
ience to china for silks and tea and back
ound the horn again to twenty degrees
orth latitude had made a sailor of him

ut not one competent to lead a focsle
 mncil or decide when hash made of salt
feef three years in the cask became unfit
wr foremast food

   taint no plum duff corroborated

rthro the cook of the focsle he was
	

a gay header and his copper skin and
sinewy strength marked him as one of the
little colony of indians on nantucket who
supplied so many prime sailors to yankee
clippers when we knocked in the head
of the cask and was hoistin it to the main-
top i thought it was pretty strong how-
somever- jethro stabbed his spoon into
the mess as much as to say that it was eat
this or go -empty but even he made a wry
face as the mouthful approached his nose
and grimaced as he swallowed it

   n i aint a-goin to eat it nuther said
bennett in stubborn determination getting
to his feet im a-goin to capn esten
i be and im a-goin to tell him taint fitten
ter feed a sailor such stuff

  hi belay that warned jethro amid
stir and murmur of alarm throughout the
focsle ye fule mr deckerll just
knock ye down

  but driven by the anger of a long-suffer-
ing man smarting under injustice the other
had run up the focsle ladder and was on
his way aft before any one of a half dozen
outstretched hands could catch and detain
him

  from the forecastle as far aft as the
mainmast he walked swiftly but as he ap-
proached nearer and nearer the quarter-


short stories

deck his pace slackened captain esten
and mr bull decker first mate both were
in sight standing back to back near the
wheel fiddling with their quadrants while
they prepared to take a meridian altitude
of the sun so nearly overhead they could
not be sure whether the angle with the hori-
zon should be measured from the north or
the south neither was a man to be ap-
proached by a seaman for a trivial cause
and to add to bennetts reluctance to in-
terrupt the officers engaged in the mysteri-
ous business of shooting the sun the
weather was threatening

  the win t hr op lay in a belt of flat calm
with all sails set and hanging limply from
the yards here and there a faint cats-
paw was ruffling the surface of the sea
and a moment or two before one of these
light puffs must have filled the sails for
the ship still kept steerage way yet wind
was coming overhead the sun still shone
bright and hot but to the westward a black
mass of thundercloud had climbed up al-
most to the zenith in ten minutes or so
the sun would be blotted out there would
be a squall of wind and a torrent of rain
not long in duration but of gale intensity
and even to bennetts by no means acute
perception it was high time for the win-
throp to shorten sail yet though his fin-
gers tightened about the mess kid he
crossed the quarterdeck and stopped an
arms length from the officers waiting awk-
wardly for them to notice him simul-
taneously as the sun dipped from its ze-
nith the two lowered their quadrants

  what are yer doin aft git forward
where ye belong growled decker

  bennetts face reddened largely from
embarrassment for in spite of his size
he was shy and speech was not easy to him
hut he stood his ground though he knew
it was ever a word and a blow with decker
the mate had first gone to sea as a fore-
mast hand and fought his way aft to the
quarterdeck by the bull strength of his
shoulders he had a surly pride in the
scars fifteen years of fighting had left on
nis face a broken nose the front teeth
kone from both jaws where a second mate
had smashed him in the mouth with a be-
aying pin off java head long ago he
had spat out the teeth that day kicked the
teet from under his assailant while he lay
on the deck and then jumped up and used
his boots so savagely the mate spent the rest
ot the voyage knitting broken ribs decker
got his berth

  bennett was a big man six feet tall and
weighing over two hundred and though his

broad face expressed good nature n
than the implacability of a fighter deck
distrusted all big men who might win
motion as he had done at his expense
was his habit to manhandle them early
the voyage to ease his mind but benn
had gone into the starboard or secot
mates watch and there had been no
portunity now dccker licked his lips
anticipation and his big fits closed skn

  i want ter speak ter the capn sir lie
nett persisted decker gathered hims
together but captain esten by a quick stc
forward spoiled his chance for an urn
pected rush

  go forward snapped the skipp
what do you mean by coming aft w
weve got to shorten sail

  still bennett stood his ground

  this hash aint fitten fer a christian
eat he said stubbornly thet salt
is spiled capn and yer kin smell it
yerself

  esten snatched the kid from the sailn
hands looked sniffed tossed its cont
over the rail and thrust the wooden
back into bennetts fingers

  now you dont have to eat it get
ward he ordered

  capn taint- bennett persist
when with a bellow decker leaped for
neck

  both the mates hands reached out
the back of the sailors head he inten
to catch bennett by the collar of
checked calico shirt and by a sudden
smash the sailors face against his
skull but with both hands bennett th
out the mess kid like a battering ramj
struck decker in the chest and stor
him though the force of the rush kn
the kid from the sailors hands

  im a-goin sir he cried i
mean no disrespect capn-

  stop it mister esten snapped
tried to catch decker by the shoulder
the latter tore away and leaped for be
again lists swinging one the
blocked with a hastily raised forearm
other struck him in the ribs with a th
like a maul hitting a barrel still he
his feet and a push of his open right h
against deckers throat sent the male s
gering back as far as the wheel

  doant ye cried bennett men
of focsle tales in which sailors had b
kicked into insensibility shot spr
eaglet by the thumbs and flogged for
less than he had done terrified him bir
decker recovered and closed in ben
shut both eyes and struck with all
the black squall

 ght his fist crashed solidly against
 ue a body struck the deck and when a
 vmd passed without a further assault
 de upon him bennett opened his eyes
 the rim of stormcloud had covered the
  and the ivinthrop was suddenly in sha-
 v decker lay sprawled flat on his back
 he helmsmans feet insensible with only
 white showing between his half opened
 lids knocked out completely and
 ttain esten was staring at bennett in
 lzement only for an instant-then his
 h snapped together and his black eyes
 hed

 mr hayes boatswain he shouted
 rail his officers to his assistance

 jehind bennett there was a thump as a
 ch was clapped on the slam of the bolt
 oting home and jethro glided past him
 confront the skipper
 t he didnt mean it sir said the gay
 ider his brown face was impassive
 only the glitter of his black eyes bore
 less to intense excitement i clapped
 the cabin hatch and the officers cant
 on deck capn esten cause he didnt
 n mutiny sir he didnt

 he cabin hatch shook as the imprisoned
 rs beat on its under surface with their
 in the breathless hush over the
 un that precedes the breaking of a black
 dl in thunder and rain their half muffled
 its were audible captain esten alone
 r his quarterdeck recoiled a pace he
 still holding his quadrant and he bent
 n slowly to place it in the binnacle as
 igh its safety were his first considera-

 hough skipper esten was only twenty-
 slender of medium height not yet
 ned to his full strength once it came to
 rs he would be a child in the hands of
 r of the two sailors yet he was master
 le ship whose will was law on the high
 given time he might iron these mu-
 ts shoot them if he wished mr
 es and the petty officers would break
 way onto deck soon the crew had
 the focsle but they stood irresolute by
 rmainmast too awed by his authority
 the force alloat and ashore which he
 ded to take part in jethros defiance
 ett was white-faced and jethro him-
 tood with his arms folded the gay
 ers face was set and determined but
 jped to avoid violence that esten
 t a glance
 porarily he was helpless but he
  deal with the mutineers later now
 ist take in sail before the squall blew
 of the bolt ropes he took two quick



strides to the starboard rail so that ben-
lett and jethro were no longer between him
and the crew

clew royals and tgallants he shouted
all hands take in sail

  no belay that jethro shouted
wheeling in his turn ill break the head
of the first man to touch a rope

  the crew hesitated a negro pushed out
of the crowd and started for the main
tgallant down haul but a lanky sailor
caught him by the collar and pulled him
back

  lively esten shouted and started
forward to enforce his order only to meet
jethro breast to breast

  it aint mutiny exclaimed the latter
his words tumbling over one another as he
talked swiftly to take advantage of the
few seconds remaining before the squall
broke bennetts my shipmate capn
and hes a greenhorn that dont hardly
know his ropes yet i wont have him
thumped or flogged for somethin he didnt
mean

  it werent fitten fer a christian ter
eat muttered bennett

  dye think ill let a foremast hand come
it over me whispered esten the blood
throbbed over his cheekbones in his fierce
dark face till he suggested a red hawk
poised to swoop dye think i can pass
open mutiny by the lord harry no
then do what you like to me later but
youll see every stick and rag go off this
ship in the next minute jethro cried
its your first ship howll it feel to be
dismasted whatll old stony esten say
when his son comes into salem caught

ed over them the
whirling clouds
of its forefront bespeaking the force of the
wind to come esten spared it one glance
and then his eye jumped from mast to
mast each clothed in canvas and settled on
the crew standing at the shrouds ready to
go aloft fearful of the outcome but never-
theless standing behind jethro the first
strong puff of wind that heralded the squall

ofanvaand creak of the blocks as he
running rigging drew taut there was
still time to take in sail but already it was
the last possible moment

  no aid esten talk of my father
will you hed rather id sink the ship
than see his son strike his colors to a damn
copper-colored sand-llea of a foremast
hand dismast her if you like but when
this squalls over ill deal with you and
bennett as i see fit

  jethro shrugged and folded ins arms
esten did the same and faced the sailor
and the two waited eye meeting eye both
were pale both feared what was to hap-
pen but hoped that at the last moment the
other would lack nerve and yield

  i didnt go fer to hit mr decker ben-
nett began

  be still snapped esten and jethro
together

  in the heart of the cloud the lightning
flashed a white line of tossing waves clear
against the gloom to windward became vis-
ible and raced toward the ship

  heres the wind sir jethro warned

  let it come said esten

then the squall knocked the win-
throp down it struck her towering
canvas with a bellow of wind and
a deluge of rain it tore her main royal
from the bolt ropes and sent it kiting off
to leeward the fore royal yard cracked
before the sail ripped to tatters the rest
of the rigging held and the force of the
squall heeled the ship to starboard over and
down till the sea rose over the starboard
rail and foamed half across the deck amid-
ships and the masts were all but flat upon
the water the ship struggled to rise but
the force of the wind held her prostrate
and during that first tremendous gust of
the storm when it blew a gale without a
seconds lull the winthrop was all but on
her beam ends better for her if her sails
had gone for once down a ship will rarely
rise again

  on the poop the man at the wheel kept
his footing but esten jethro and bennett
were flung in a heap against the lee rail
decker slid across the deck after them and
as the rail dipped might have gone over
the side had not jethro caught him by the
waistband of his trousers and held him
aboard pushing the mate who stirred
and muttered as the cold salt water began
to revive him to bennetts arms jethro
scrambled along the steep deck and pulled
esten out of the water

  hard up-put your helm hard up
skipier yelled

  the helmsman heard and the w
turned but with the ship on her beam
and making no way through the water
would not answer to her rudder

  got to get sail off her jethro shou
in the captains ear

  esten shook the wet black liair out
his eyes and rose to his knees to peer f
ward through the rain that half conceal
the ship a few of the crew were cli
ing to the main shrouds others lay behi
the jort bulwarks holding onto the pin
with hands and teeth

  cant do it the c ptain replied si
ing though jethro was not a yard away
order to make himself heard decks t
steep to work the downhauls or brac
he paused angry that he had answered
seaman at all what do you care y
got what you wanted he yelled

  jethro shook his head not mutii
he shouted back had to stand by a sbf
mate-i can cut away the masts sir
no give her a chance to rise-
father built this ship esten yelled cs
blow like this long sailsll go but
rather lose them than the sticks w
got into you jethro

  i wont eat that hash but ill do
duty sir bellowed bennett before
shipmate could answer will ye he
mr decker sir hes cornin arou
thrusting the struggling mate into tl
skippers arms bennett crawled oyer
jethro the latter shouted something
his ear and the two began to work t
way forward off the poop and into tl
waist here they crawled to the crcw
jethro reached the side of the lanky saiffl
and shouted in his ear the latter shot
his head evidently refusing to release i
grip and move from his place of safet
and the gay header struck him in the fa
the sailor let go slid down the deck in
the lee rail and crawled forward rubbil
a bruised jaw meanwhile bennett hi
pulled two men from the rail by rna
strength and drove them before him
ward the focsle

  still the wind blew without cessatio
and the winthrop was held on her bea
ends esten dragged decker as far as 
wheel and draped him around the binnacl
and then to his surprise saw bennett ail
jethro come crawling back

  i close hauled the jib and fore staysail
panted the gay header in his ear they
bring her head around if she rises and mi
can scud before it twont blow long

                                                            
the black squall

  thats well said the skipper well
save her yet lad he smiled with stern
approval and added sorry you mutinied
and trying to curry favor eh

  no said the sailor but i aint noth-
ing against you or your ship sir only
taint right to flog a greenhorn sir and
decker had a grudge

  decker can kill his own snakes re-
joined the skipper but its irons for
you my lad

  jethro only shrugged then with sud-
den excitement he shouted she rises sir 
rising she was the first fury of the
squall was slackening the rain fell harder
but the wind dropped and the winthrops
trucks slowly lifted from the sea as she
rose the close hauled jib caught the wind
and began to drag her head around helped
by the rudder

  shes a fine vessel-watch her sir
jethro breathed

  none better than the esten ships
boasted the skipper and gripped the sailors
shoulder in excitement

  like a tired man the winthrop rose
erect and fell off before the squall aloft
the mizzen tgallant split in two yards
bucked and slatted for though jethro tried
to drive the crew to the braces they were
shaken by their narrow escape loath to be
plucked from their handholds and in any
case there was no time to trim the yards
but the ship bore the squalls fury yards
whipped the over-strained backstays hum-
med and boomed she gathered way and
went streaking through the water once
more the squall came down in full force
until the vessel put her lee rail awash and
jumped ahead while jethro threw back his
head and yelled in sheer excitement and
delight

  his yell was echoed from the poop
where esten steered his teeth set and shin-
ing white struggling with a bucking twist-
ing wheel that was far too much for the
skippers light weight even aided by the
helmsman until bennett understood the
crisis and threw his great bulk on the lee
wheel ten minutes of wild sailing and
then with a final whoop the wind dropped
to a steady breeze the sun popped out and
the black squall went roaring off to leeward
leaving a troubled sea that slowly smoothed
and a breath of breeze that wafted the ship
along at a bare two knots an hour by the
wheel decker pulled himself erect and felt
his jaw

  squalls blew over hey he muttered
the words wheezing and hissing through
the gap in his front teeth an wheres



that bennett ye tamed him did ye
capn

  yes squalls over replied esten
shortly between middle-aged mate and
young master there was no love lost for
when old stony esten put the winthrop
in command of his son because all smart
salem lads captained ships when they
reached their majority he had sent the
mate along to keep an eye on things
nothing had ever been said of this either
by stony or the two officers but the
younger man knew and resented it

  and a fine hurrahs nest the squall left
didnt it-all your doing decker the cap-
tain reproached bennett hes forward
sending up a new fore royal yard youve
met a better man decker esten added
with relish

  not me sir growled the mate but his
hand continued to caress his jaw and he
made no move to go forward howd he
come to git past ye and the sail still
spread

  thats my business said the skipper
sharply like it was when you jumped
at a man when he was still talking to me
lemme tell you mister the estens can
kill their own snakes and dont need help
of a mate a foremast hand can knock down
you began it-watch me finish it now

  with the passing of the squall the crew
had turned to with a will and the damage

aloft was al-
ready partially
cleared once
the job was in
hand jethro slid
down the
shrouds and
walked aft to the
quarter-
deck stopping at
the hatch to
knock back the
bolt and release
the imprisoned
officers they
rushed out led
by the tall lanky
hayes the sec-
ond mate and
began an angry
and excited bab-
b  e that esten
stilled with a n
upraised hand
for jethro had faced the skipper the
gay headers arms were folded in his
level black eyes was neither defiance nor
a plea for mercy he was waiting the
short stories



captain hardened his lips fore and aft
men stood still straining their ears for
his first word and over the ships side the
ground swell kicked up by the squall slap-
ped loudly against the hull 

  whos master aboard this ship es-
ten demanded	

  i dont know-yet jethro dared de-
pends whats done-now theres moren
one idea in the afterguard

  get the irons said esten though
his eyes never left the sailors the com-
mand was addressed to the second mate
but it was decker who hurried below his
tongue licking his bruised lips and when
he reappeared with the handcuffs he also
carried a three-foot length of rope knotted
at one end to give it weight and make sure
of breaking the skin when it fell across a
naked back jethros eyes began to glit-
ter dangerously

  you refused to obey an order the cap-
tain charged you cost me a royal yard
two royals and a tgansle got anything
to say

  no said jethro

  hold out your hands

  the sailors eyes flashed glanced right
and left then seeing the hopelessness of
resistance he extended his wrists and esten
slipped the heavy manacles upon them

  also you pulled mr decker back over
the side and shortened sail the captain
continued as though it were a part of his
indictment the key turned in the cuffs
first left then right three days in irons
in the sail locker get below

  youre master captain esten he said
with stem approval and turned on his heel

  by the bull o barney capn shouted
the outraged decker sail locker hell
just caulk off there all day snoozin on his
back warm and snug you aint even
fastened them irons-he cn slip em off in
a jiffy here-heres the medicine fer a
mutinous dog he shook the knotted
ropes end

  when i want your advice ill ask for
hu ster decker said the skipper

  maybe you know whos master here
hey 

  the little captain stepped forward his
angry eyes looked up into the mates surly
face and decker subsided muttering be-
sides your turn s coming esten promised
with saturnine humor send bennett
aft

  more slowly even than at noon when

the black squall still hung over the ship
the big sailor obeyed on the way he
passed jethro but the latters whisper to
keep a stiff upper lip fell on deaf ears for
the stubborn slow thinking farmer ex-
pected the worst

  sir he rumbled when he reached the
quarterdeck pulling his forelock in an awk-
ward sea salute

  you knocked mr decker down es-
ten snapped

  i didnt go fer ter do it grumbled the
sailor sullenly he hit at me he did
and-

  belay that interrupted the captain
theres never been blowing or striking on
the esten ships cept when a man talks
back or refuses duty you going to re-
fuse duty

  no sir the big man shook his head i
slowly his blue eyes wide i never sir i
only-

  see you remember warned the skip- j
per thats all i got to say now-if 
you an mister decker got anything to set-
tle settle it-and by the lord harry the i
best man comes aft out of the corner
of his eye the skipper was watching his
mate decker was a bully but for all that
he was a quick thinker as the sailor was
not fresh in his mind was that open j
handed shove of bennetts that had 
checked his bull rush in mid career the j
blow on the jaw that had stretched him 
senseless for at least ten minutes easy 
to order bennett about risky to face the i
issue fist to fist in that second the mate 
decided for discretion

  mind what capn esten says and go j
forard you decker growled-growled
like a big dog that does not dare to bite j
but bennett lingered all this talk bewil-
dered his slow-witted mind and he was 
a man of one idea

  i aint had no dinner sir he remon-
strated half stubborn half humble and j
that hash wamt fitten-

  oh go forward go forward esten j
chuckled  thet hash and that beef was 
spilled when the squall had us on our beam
ends-the doctors cooking new

  thankee sir thankee said bennett 
and went forward with a grin on his broad
face the sunlight which followed the squall
warm on his back
a fresh recruit

by herbert l mcnary
author of fighting fishermen tied races etc

pep was what the big league green sox needed they had everything else
and then station wow connors was signed up and-but read for yourself

myer gottenberg tailor
by trade waited anxiously
for the first customer of the
morning to walk off and for-
get his paper the customer
obliged and myer pounced on the journal
and turned eagerly to the sporting page
his eager eyes danced behind thick lenses
and in a moment he was rubbing his slim
hands in glee as he read where the green
sox had been walloped lo defeat in the
ninth inning by the whales and such
ostentatious joy on the part of myer was
not easily understandable for in the
first place far from being a supporter of
the victorious whales or even a resident of
the whales home town myer as a mat-
ter of fact lived in the big league town
represented by the vanquished green sox
and anyway myer knew less about base-
ball than he did about the einstein theory

  to understand myers gladsome emo-
tion one would have had to know or have
some knowledge of manager sliding pat
nulty of the green sox

   pat nulty used to be a fair base stealer
in the days of his youth but he never ac-
quired the cognomen of sliding until he
became a bench manager manager nulty
controlled his team from the dugout fur-
thermore he never wore the togs of an
active player instead he arrayed himself
in civilians usually blue and sat on the
bench and there he needed considerable
room for when the breaks went against


 the green sox manager nulty commenced
 sliding up and down the bench all of
  which was very detrimental to the seat of
 his trousers which latter misfortune in
 turn was very profitable to his tailor
 myer gotten berg so now you know why
 myer always prayed for misfortune lo
 frown upon the green sox and rejoiced
 accordingly when it did

   business for myer had been very good
 lately and that afternoon the sox drop-
 ped a second game to the whales follow-
 ing its conclusion manager nulty stag-
 gered into the green sox clubs executive
 offices-and kept close to the wall

   have all the stenographers gone he
 asked anxiouslv of the club secretary

  yes why

   i wore out another pair of pants and
 with a shadow of relief dispelling some of
 the clouds that had permanently settled
 upon his woebegone countenance manager
 nulty crossed to the owners office

   owner childs ordinarily had the pa-
 tience of job but the limit had been
 reached

   well are we ever going to win again
 he asked nulty sourly as that perturbed
 person dropped into a chair across the desk
 from him

   nulty shook his head wearily im be-
 ginning to doubt it theyre driving me
 cuckoo

   whats wrong complained the owner
 for two years now ive been outbidding




short stories

everyone for the best won in the country
and as far as plugging holes it s like pour-
ing water into a sieve didn t i pay 

and three players for betts to plug up third

  and the sap has to go and get married
on the strength of it sighed manager
nulty and half the time he dont know
whether he is on third base or the wash-
ington monument then there is pricker
and corrigan at short and second always
putting the alphonse and gaston act they
stick together like two sheets of fly paper
i tried breaking them up as roommates last
road trip

  was that when they hit the slump
yes and youd think id placed a con-
tinent between them its like that with
the whole team they got the mechanical
ability but what good is that it aint
like the good old days when a ball player
took the game seriously when if you were
caught speaking anything but profane lan-
guage to an opponent you were mobbed
by your mates and you had to sneak into
the park and leave with a bat in each hand
and there were more black eyes in the club
than gloves maybe the game is more re-
fined now but just the same it can go too
far now all the players think about is
real estate and automobiles and clothesand
manners youd think they were actors
most of them are at that i got three
irishmen on the team and im ashamed of
them not an argument in the crowd

what good are a bunch of stars if-

  the secretary stuck his head into the
room

  someone to see you pat says liis
name is dennison

  dennison a faint glow came into
the seamed face of the tired manager
send him in

  a moment later nultys counterpart en-
tered the room his eyes were blue where
nultys were brown and he was three
inches taller and pounds lighter than nulty
but he was just as manifestly a baseball
man as the manager of the green sox
nulty jumped to meet him

    tom its one long time since ive heard
from youm he grinned as he pumped his
hand then he turned to childs heres
one of those old time ball players  was
jubt telling you about he looks as peace-
ful as a priest now and thats the way he
always was off the field but stick a plug of
tobacco in his gob and get him on the dia-
mond and billy the kid was a saint com-
pared to him

  ou were some ructious yourself pat



in the old brotherhood days grinned

dennison you paid more assault fines
than i ever did

  yeah sighed nulty reflectively them
were the good old days he came back
to earth and what are you doing now
tom

  still in baseball owner and manage
of parkerville team

  there followed a brief hiatus while
nulty sought for some painless method of
extracting the location of parkerville

  its in the tri-county league sup-
plied dennison

  sure  know lied nulty fooling only
himself dennison smiled wistfully

  i dont wonder you never heard of it l
i own the franchise but it aint worth a jit i
and im gettin along in years now pat
you want me to help you out sup-
plied nulty while childs looked on suspi- 
ciously

  yes i sure do pat you hold the key i
to my future i know where i can get a
wonderful ranch out in california for
 and the doctors say mary thats 
my wife needs the california climate
then im planning to send both eddie and
mildred to college

  nulty commenced to squirm uneasily
trying to slide in the chair as he did on the 
bench

  what do you want me to do

  i want you to buy a player from me i
that is i want you to persuade mr childs 
here to buy him

  how much asked childs sharply
  stooooo mr childs

  the owner made a sound like a gurgling j
brook and slumped in his chair nulty
gasped like a fish

  what is he a pitcher the manager j
finally asked

  no an infielder

  whats his batting average
  two-thirty-eight 

  what then lies a wonderful fielder 
is that it

  his average for third base was second
best in the league stated dennison

  how many games did he play third 
  eight

  say tom exclaimed nulty what
are you doing kidding me

  i never was so serious in my life pat

i want that californian ranch im stak-
ing everything on this player he hasnt
got a baseball asset except maybe being a
good or a lucky pinch hitter but were
leading the league such as it is and crab
connors is the reason and i know liell
a fresh recruit

make you lead this league ive studied the
paper accounts of the green sox so that i

know the team
almost as well
as you do pat
and im telling
you that con-
nors will take
you out of sixth
place and win
you the pen-
n a  because
you got the stuff
here

	but 

is quite a sum to gamble on a two-thirty-
eight minor leaguer suggested childs
with veiled sarcasm-

  im taking the gamble mr childs
you pay me the  if you win the
pennant--and the world series will more
than make up that amount or pay me
 if you come second or third
 if you come fourth and nothing
if you fail to make the first division will
you gamble with me

  childs pondered swinging back and
forth in the swivel chair

  anyone who can put the green sox in
the first division is worth  to me
he said ill take a chance

  thank you mr childs and youre go-
ing to pay me that hundred grand too just
one thing pat no matter what this con-
nors says let him get away with it

  so long as the team climbs assented
nulty

crab connors joined the green
sox in chicago he came into the
ornate lobby of the ritz looking like
a small town sheik wearing podunk cor-
ners conception of fifth avenues latest
in gents furnishings he had a bristly
thatch the color of brick dust two aggres-
sive blue eyes and a chin that demanded
recognition the ornateness of the lobby
failed to dazzle him as he crossed to the
desk and asked for manager nulty the
latter had just concluded dinner and was
in the lobby connors had him pointed
out and then advanced upon him

  say youre manager nulty aintcha
im connors your new infielder when
do i eat

  the manager was a bit taken back but
remembered his promise not to scatter
vituperation on this new recruit

  ill get you a room and have something
sent up

  whadya mean sent up demanded



connors this is my first whack at a big
league chow house and im not passing it
up for an invalids sandwich breakfast in
the hay may be the works but im no cow 
i want a table once in a while

  but you cant go in protested nulty
its past the dinner hour and you would
have to pay a cover charge in the blue
room

  say are you a manager or an umpire
snapped the rookie cant you see them
eating in there

  but they were in there before the clos-
ing hour-hey where are you going
im going in an eat and connors
strode determinedly for the main dining
room a waiter sought to dissuade him
with a polite smile but smiles werent
stopping connors

  out of my way greaseball he shot
out of the corner of his mouth and pushed
the astonished waiter aside and tossed him-
self into a chair at an empty table the
headwaiter came bustling over he too
wore an indulgent smile

  you cant come in here he explained
whadya mean i cant im in here
aint i 

  but-it ees after the hour the head-
waiter lost his urbanity and became dis-
tressed

  can that chatter napoleon this is a
hotel aint it its a public service insti-
tution aint it its got a license to satisfy
the publics necessary cravings aint it
well its got to do that so long as the hotel
is open thats the law

  the headwaiter stared at him uncompre-
hendingly through popping eyes and
then appreciating that the affair was
arousing attention he quickly summoned a
waiter and instructed him to take connors
order

  connors consulted the elaborate menu
  well start with some whcatcakes
  the waiter dropped his pencil

  msieu we have ze wheatcakes only at
breakfast his resentment would have
subdued an ordinary man but connors
only bristled

  wliadya mean breakfast its on the
menu aint it get me the headwaiter get
me the manager an everybody

  before he got through connors had
about everyone of the hotel staff gathered
around his table the gist of his incon-
trovertible argument was this if a store
makes a mistake and advertises a thousand
dollar fur coat for ten bucks i can go in
and get it for ten bucks cant    hat s
the law aint it well this is the same


short stories

aint it it says wheatcakes on the menu
dont it youve contracted to feed me
whats on the menu aint-havent you
where do you aliens get off tryin to tell us
americans what the law is

  shure an who the divil do ye be cal-
lin an alien to flamed the house detec-
tive only to have the manager restrain

him	 

  lissun i ordered wheatcakes and i m

going to get em aint i 

  the manager and house detective went
into consultation and it was decided that
connors was to get his wheatcakes he
got them whatever else he got only the
manager house detective and chef knew

  manager nultv had given connors in-
structions to report to him at ten in the
morning but it was just about this time
that connors solved the method of sleep-
ing in a hotel bed manager nulty met
him in the lobby when he and some of the
players came in from dropping another
game to chicago and the manager felt
about as joyful as a radio fan with five
blown out tubes

  why didnt you report to the park he
bellowed while the regulars gathered
around to see the rookie suffer

  whadya mean report to the park this
is the last day in chi this trip aint it
i gotta have some time to look the burg
over havent i 

  nulty purpled and threatened to break
a blood vessel or two but only made a rum-
bling sound

  get packed he snapped we take
the eight oclock train

  connors made no effort to fraternize
with the green sox on the train instead
he flopped into one of the sections not
made up and perused a play by play ac-
count of the days game one that failed to
pay compliments to the men who sat chat-
ting or playing cards around him about
the time the train rumbled across into in-
diana the secretary came and stood over
him

  connors youre in the wrong section
vou re sleeping in upper seven

  whadya mean upper snapped con-
as  sleepinm a lower aint i

  a derisive shout of laughter went up
from all the players

   listen said big steve polaski the first
sacker his amusement tempered with good
intentions only regulars get the lowers

  whadya mean regulars ive been
readm this account of todays game for an
hour tryin to find a regular ball player
in the outfit six errors dumb base run-

ning faunin in the pinches why you you

 big squarehead

	havent got a
hit since they
started m a k-
i n g base-balls

white

  now nor-
mally big po-
laski had the
disposition of
ja dresden
i doll but a man
in a slump is not normal and the manner
in which connors passed his compliments
out of tlie side of his mouth would irritate
an alligator the big player flushed and
exclaimed indignantly

   thats all right im the regular first
baseman

  regular hookworm ya mean he
grabbed the paper and read  polaski
failed to cover first and welsh was safe
barret and polaski let smiths pop fly fall
between them and froman scored from
second why you big squarehead you
play first like the pyramids play egypt
polaski opened his mouth to retort but
sensing the futility of engaging in verbal
combat with this terrier he drew off like a
saint bernard hell get that freshness
taken out of him he grumbled to his
mates it was so long since fists had flown
on the green sox that it never occurred to
polaski to resort to this method

  dan horgan veteran catcher felt that
he owed it to his age dignity and race to
take the young upstart in hand

   one of the first things every rookie is
supposed to learn young man is to hold
his tongue he instructed in the compelling
tones of a traffic cop

  whadya mean hold my tongue
youre a fine one to tell me not to talk
youre dumb dan horgan aintcha tlie
guy what talked an umpire into takin a
game away from you

  horgan turned the colors of the rain-
bow connors had referred-as succinctly
as it ever had been-to the one sore spot
in horgans life and ball players need to
make but one several jears ago horgan
had involved an umpire in dispute despite
the fact that the green sox had a lead of
four runs in an important game in the
ninth the umpire called a mail out at the
plate the runner protested vigorously
that horgan had not touched him hor-
gan to embarrass the umpire substantiated
the runner and the umpire in rage re-
versed his decision whereupon the team
a fresh

 came to life and put over five runs and
 horgan learned where he had talked him-
 self out of a game now he had been re-
 minded of it by one of his own team and
 a rookie at that

   joe kane centerfi elder came in from
 another car and was informed of the roo-
 kies intention to occupy a lower his first
 night traveling

   try and get in one challenged kane

   try and keep me out of one retorted
 connors and dove into the nearest berth
 which happened to have been assigned to
 glenn the big right fielder it was up to
 the easy-going outer gardener to get him
 out and glenn scratched his head over the
 problem for he had no desire to have his
 pedigree analyzed nor his diamond trans-
 gressions caustically reviewed the green
 sox goaded big glenn into action and his
 resentment smouldered not so much against
 connors as against his mates

   i never thought i roomed with a guy
 that was yellow declared homer cottle
 who patroled the left fields in the summer
 time and the georgia savannahs in the
 winter

   whos yellow you big cracker and
 glenn exchanged the first harsh words
 with his buddy in three years ill get
 him out when im ready to hit the hay

   eventually glenn decided to retire and a
 squabble ensued in his berth assisted by
 others he plucked out the kicking connors
 and tossed him into upper seven connors
 poked his head through the green curtain
 and for twenty minutes or more proved
 himself an omnivorous gleaner of statis-
 tics by reminding each and everyone of
 the score and all the ball players of their
 numerous weaknesses misfortunes delin-
 quencies and transgressions

   in a few sizzling moments he gave a
 consensus of all the biting opinions of the
 most vitriolic of sport writers as to why a
  team with seven three-hundred hitters and
 three star pitchers languished in sixth
 place shoes magazines and numerous
 impedimenta came his way hurled by men
 with high priced throwing arms but he
 avoided all contributions with the dispatch
  of an african dodger and never paused to
 dot his is or cross his ts in his ora-
  tory until he had driven everyone of the
 j players to bed

   but crab connors made no attempt to
 i close his eyes in that narrow confinement
  of upper seven but merely rested while
 i the train swayed from side to side and the
  wheels clicked symphoniously beneath him
 with no other sounds to create discord save

recruit

heavy breathing and a faint snore or two
then connors lowered himself from his
berth to the curtain lined aisle

  beneath each berth were pairs of shoes
connors took these and rearranged them
so that their makers could not tell them
apart removing or tying lacings when so
inclined then he proceeded to hunt up
his baggage he found his suitcase and
removed what he wanted from it near
by was a bat bag and on second thought he
removed a bat also and then made his
swaying way back to number seven with
a bat in one hand and a ukelele in the other
he clambered into his berth

oh-h-h it aint gonna rain no mo no mo
it aint gonna rain no mo

how in the heck can i wash my neck
if it aint gonna rain no mo

  this was the selection rendered by con-
nors and he certainly rendered it in a beau-
tiful rheumatic tenor accompanied by some
original ukulele discords with numerous
verses

  sing something new growled a voire
smothered by a pillow

oh-h-li what i sing is new enough
for all youse guys im thin kin

for from the pep youse burglars show
i think you played with lincoln

oh-h-h it aint gonna rain no mo no mo
it aint gonna rain no mo-

  hey feeble-minded-bag your head

oh-h-h sticks and stones may break my
  bones

call me zvhat you can

but all that i will say to you
is so is your old man

oh-h-h it aint gonna rain no mo no mo
it aint gonna rain no mo-

  a dozen or more of angered athletes
tumbled out into the aisle

  somebody kill that pest will ya please

oh-h-h it seems to me that i just heard
someone call me a pest

well until i get a lower berth
no one will get no rest

oh-h-h it aint gonna rain no mo no mo
it aint gonna-

  connors scrambled to his knees and
clutched his bat as he sensed assault

the first who tries to climb this betj
gets this bat right over the head
so

short stories

he paused and surveyed the pajama

brigade in the
aisle

do i get my
lower berth

 u s e the
head growled
joe kane we
got to open with
a double header
tuesday

what of it

  you couldnt

play no worse if you were unconscious
do i get my lower r

  he got it

connors slept late the next morn-
ing and for all the oaths that per-
vaded the sleeping car and shriveled
the porter when it came time to putting on
shoes none had the temerity to awaken
connors ball players are the most con-
servative people in the wrorld the green
sox were spared his interference until he
poked his head through the cordon watch-
ing an intense game of bridge corrigan
and fricker the damon and pythias of
baseball were playing cottle and kane
and all four seemed to have unusual cases
of nerves

  why didnt you finesse on hearts
crabbed connors calling attention to an
obvious error on the part of corrigan one
which lost game and rubber and which
others had been kind enough not to men-
tion

  what do you know about bridge
snapped corrigan coloring angrily

  this much-that theres only supposed
to be one dummy at a time

  you might have known i had the king
cut in fricker peeved at losing i bid
no j rumps you apple head

  whos an apple head  in attempting
to rise corrigan kicked fricker the lat-
ter thought it deliberate just as corrigan
saw no accident in frickers tipping the
card table on him in a moment they were
swinging at each other cottle jumped in
to separate them and stopped a swing on
the nose and lashed out blindly by the
time the peace dove hovered over the
peered again rah connors had disap-

  despite the fact that the statistical i v
strong green sox threatened to drop into
seventh place a fair throng turned out on
their return from a disastrous western
swing a double header with the pelicans
was alwaysan attraction and besides it

is always worth the price of admission to
sit safely up in the stands and tell some na-
tionally known husky how rotten he is
the first game wasnt three innings old

before the boys in the fresh white suits
gathered a bumper crop in raspberries big
steve polaski  first collected the most
because he was nearer than most of his
mates to the grandstand was bigger than
any of them and still wallowed in a batting
slump

  in the eighth the green sox unexpect-
edly produced a batting rally it was in- 
explicable as far as the fans were con-
cerned but in the green sox dugout for
eight innings crab connors had eloquently 
expounded on his first impressions of a big ji
league game and those who played it until j
the sox commenced going to the plate with
burning ears this unlooked lor rally
fell short of tying the game by one run
which was just about what the fans ex-
pected

  then in the ninth kane led off with a
triple and in the excitement the fans for-
got their resentment but remembered it
when fricker and cottle popped out then
the pelicans pitcher lost control and
walked glenn and betts bringing up po-
laski who had been dropped in the batting
order

  i think this is where i get out of my
slump exclaimed polaski reaching for a
bat

  you got as much chance of getting out
of a slump as a murderer has out oi the
electric chair snarled connors say
whats my chances of goin up im the
best pinch hitter in baseball

  nulty looked at him one run was
needed to tie a pass would force that in
the pelican twirler was wild and connors
made a much smaller target than the big
polaski

  go in and wait him out he ordered
polaski flung his bat away in disgust and
connors carefully selected a stick for him-
self

  the pelican pitcher needed no mental
telepathy to tell him that this rookie who
stood swinging his bat menacingly at the
platter had come up with instructions to
wait for a walk and so he made the first 
ball sweeter than a gallon of ice creain
connors stepped into it and rapped it on a j
line over the third basemans head and two i
runners raced in before the left fielder got 
hold of the ball

  connors got more applause for that sin-
gle hit than the rest of the team had heard
in weeks but nulty wore anything but

                                                       
a fresh recruit



  smiles as connors came into the bench

    i told you to wait him out didnt i
 for the love of pete are you kicking
 when  won you the game

   supposing you knocked that ball into
 an infielders hands

    say lissun that aint tlie way i play
 ball

    nulty subsided

   the green sox settled the second game
 early in the second inning polaski came
 to hat with two on he had been sulking
 in the dugout between games peeved at
 the ignominy of having a rookie pinch hit
 for him still in his sulks at the bat he
 swung hard at a fast ball and hoisted it
 into the centerfield stands for his first hit
 in three games and his first homer in a
 month and that is liow polaski came out
  of his slump

   with a safe lead nulty sent connors
 v in to play third in the sixth inning and the
 j fans welcomed him with a salvo of ap-
  plause connors started a line of chatter
  that could be heard all over the park but
  had little to do in the fielding line until
  olson of the pelicans reached second and
 i then stole third on a slow ball he rode in
  high in the approved fashion of testing a
 rookies nerve and tore connors new uni-
 form connors looked at the rent and
 ithen at olson and the next minute jumped
  for him umpires and coach got them

apart about the
 time the two
 teams gathered
 around them
 and the police
 were driving
 the fans back
 into the stands
 about five
 minutes later
 the players got
 back to their
 respective po-

 -	ations and during all that time connors
 ifitened to the verbal endorsement of sev-
 ttal thousand spectators

   dan horgan saw a chance to catch the
 r n raged olson off third and snapped the
 mdl down too late olson made a head
 fcrst dive for the sack at the same time
 connors dove for him and they came to-
 other in mid air connors rose and shook
 -ae fog from his eyes olson lay cold

   hey a couple of you stretcher bear-
 rs connors yelled over to the pelicans
 tpnch come over here and drag this stiff
 ti tlie morgue

   i some of the pelicans came and they

paused long enough to tell connors of
some popular methods of doing business
with an undertaker

  yeah lissun ill take the whole team on
three at a time

  can that chatter cut in the umpire
this isnt congress

  what is it-a sewing circle

  i dont want none of your wise cracks
whadya mean wise cracks who
started this old astigmatism

  out of the game bellowed his honor
whadya mean out of the game i
havent taken a sock at you yet hell
what a league ya get put out for talk-
in if thats the case  might as well get
my moneys worth i can ask ya questions
cant i the rule book says i can well
wras it your uncle or your father that got
hung for sheep stealin 

  ill give you two minutes to get off the
field-

  well youd better put your mask on
while youre looking at the watch

  youll feel that one in the pocket off
the field i tell you

  and now as the banished connors
headed for the dugout shooting conver-
sation over his shoulder the meanwhile
the fans realized that this rookie had been
put out of a game on his first day and
these fans ran the risk of contracting ton-
sillitis as they alternatinglv encouraged him
and condemned the umpire

  usually somewhere in the final para-
graphs of the sporting accounts of the dou-
ble header as printed the following day
there was some mention of the games
themselves but practically all the rest of
tlie paragraphs were devoted to the latest
acquisition to the green sox fighting
crab connors broadcasting and sta-
tion wow were some of the agnomens
attached to him and he was credited with
contributing more color than the northern
lights that day the fans came out in
droves to get a look at him he came
through as a pinch hitter in the sixth and
then went in at second where he made two
assists a putont and an error and pre-
cipitated a dozen arguments

  at no time in the games that followed
did connors play brilliantly although he
was always more or less spectacular as a
fielder he fought the ball making his plays
appear difficult and his misses excusable
and he failed to shine at the bat except in
pinches when nearly everyone else in the
park was handicapped by a nervous ten-
sion most of the games found him on tlie
coaching line where his rasping penetrat-
short stories



mg tones informed the universe of the

misfortunes and indiscretions of all oppos-
ing players their immediate relatives and
remote ancestors with the result that more
than one wild pitch went skimming by his
head and he took his life in his hands
whenever he went to bat

  gossip travels rapidly in the big leagues
and connors distended ears gathered all
that was essential and used this for the
foundation of elaborate libel with innate
shrewdness he learned just how far he
could go with each umpire and clung to
the line with the skill of a blondin at
that umpires hesitated to banish or sus-
pend him for then he could sit in the
grandstand and being beyond their juris-
diction needed to place no restraint upon
his invective or his efforts to incite may-
hem

  it must not be suspected that he spared
his own team far be it from such the
green sox had been known to be as docile
as hay munching cows now they became
caged panthers they sported more black
eyes than a leopard has spots each slight-
est difference of opinion was transmuted
under connors skillful manipulation into
a casus belli and agreement to meet under
the stands formerly the wives of the
players sat in one happy group in a box or
twobehind the sox dugout now rows of
seats intervened across which they shot
steely glares and yet connors himself
was never involved in fistic combat each
player lived in mortal terror of his tongue
and if necessary connors talked himself
out of each impending crisis

  nor was nulty himself spared and the
manager wished many times to see the last
of his pest but more than his promise to
his old friend dennison kept him from
shooting connors a baseball manager
will wear a pair of shoes two sizes too
small and risk atrophying his feet rather
than make a change while his team is win-
ning and the green sox were winning
even good natured steve polaski was ar-
guing over the close ones and mauling the
ball as if he bore it some special grudge
i he first of august had found the soxin
sixth place but the teams ahead were
pretty well bunched and after the sox had
knocked off the leaders in straight series
if became anyones race and myer got-
tenberg wrung his hands in despair for he
made no more suits now for sliding pat
nulty nulty jumped now instead of slid-
ing along the bench

  september found the green sox in third
place and without a friend in the league or

two players on the team who dared confide

in each other september fifteenth tt
slipped into second place and in the li 
week of the scheduled season they clinched
the pennant when connors talked the op
posing pitcher to throw to second with na
one  the bag tom dennison saw the
pennant won and went to the office to col-
lect his check for 

  thats an awful lot of money for m
player who has batted only two-twenty--
seven and has made almost as many errors
as putouts but there is no denying hes the
means of our winning the pennant and the 
question is am i pleased about it i used
to have one happy family an aggregation 
of gentlemen now i feel like a fagin 

  maybe youre right agreed dennison
as he put the check in his pocket moneyl
isnt everything-but it conies in handy at
times

the town hysterically prepared for j
the world series and the grays of
the other league arrived for the first
two games while the world series
brings together the best ball players of the
year it does not necessarily produce the
best ball every man is on a tension only
orthodox plays are followed and the pitch-j
ers use more stuff in each game than they
ordinarily would in a month but the
green sox began the series with none of
the usual caution connors flailed them
pitilessly and the photographing and at-
tending ceremonies failed to prove to be
soothing antidotes

  they took the field in a fighting mood
and with connors
broadcasting fro ni l
the first base coach-j
ing line they got thel
jump on the con-
servative grays and
busted the g a  e
wide open in thel
first frame thel
grays took thel
slaughter so keenly i
that they appeared 
on the field the second day completely tin-
nerved and suffered another disgraceful-
rout they recovered slightly in their own j
home town but failed by a run to save the 
game

  in the fourth game the grays who were
favored before the series opened showed
a return to form and captured the verdict
without great effort the fifth game de-
veloped into a scoreless pitching duel until
the ninth inning when the pinch hitting

                                                           
a fresh recruit

 connors worried the pitcher into a walk
 and then involved the first sacker in argu-
 ment as to whether the latters wife would
 ask for alimony or start a perennial dona-
 tion to charity for being rid of the big ba-
 loney unfortunately in the height of the
 argument the grays pitcher tried to catch
 connors napping but only fooled the first
 baseman the ball traveled to right field
 and connors legged it to third whence he
 scampered in on a sacrifice fly for game
 and series

   following the usual custom the green
 soxs share of the receipts was made out
 to a single player dan hogan and de-
 posited in his name then the players met
 to agree on the proper division only
 those players who had been with the team
 all year were privy to this session which
 automatically excluded connors dona-
 tions were made to the trainer coaches
 secretary ground keepers and others and
 half shares voted for certain of the roo-
 kies

   and now we come to connors de-
 clared cottle brave enough to break the
 silence

   heaven forbid breathed hogan but
 its got to be done my suggestion is that
 we vote him a full share for after all he
 was the means of our winning the pen-
 nant and he talked himself into the run
 that won the series

   ill agree on the full share assented
 kane because i wouldnt dare do other-
 wise  but i dont agree that he won us the
 pennant after all it is hitting and field-
 ing that wins the games and of course
 pitching we provided that connors
 merely made us recognize that we had it
 thats to his credit but there is a iot that
 isnt this money cant compensate for
 what i have gone through the past couple
 of months nor restore the friendships that
 j pest has made me lose

youre right grumbled glenn here
im going back to san francisco a block
 away from jim barrett here and id give
r a-plenty to be able to bring the wife over
i and play bridge again



  and id give the same to have you
sighed barrett

  i guess we all have a few hatchets to
bury observed hogan so lets do it
lets call the kid in give him credit for
winning the pennant this year but per-
suade him to lay off next season we
know what we can do on the field and we
can come through just as well next year
and still be one happy gang again

  gosh exclaimed fricker to corrigan
it would be great to be rooming with you
again

  you said it agreed corrigan

  and so when smiles wreathed the coun-
tenance of the green sox again and they
felt accustomed to them they called in
connors

  well beamed hogan we voted you
a full share

  wtiat the hell else do you think youd
do snapped connors

  well we didnt have to retorted bar-
rett you werent with us the whole sea-
son

  i bet you argued on that point until
your tongue dropped out youre the egg
that wanted it put in the paper that it was
only forty-seven instead of forty-nine
cents you owed glenn for a bridge game

  it was forty-seven

  youre another exclaimed glenn men-
acingly

  hey cut in kane dont be like
fricker and corrigan

  whadya mean like us demanded
fricker as he and corrigan leaped for him

  dont blame me for what fricker
starts panted corrigan between punches
and then stopped one on the ear

  cut this out snapped hogan

  who do you think you are-the man-
ager demanded cottle i ve taken your
lip just enough now you take that-

  the judge of the municipal court ruled
only on the charge of disorderly conduct
and fined each of the green sox ten dol-

 conclusion

chapter xix

the sheriff comes

kawlins walked around the
place in a dumb cold daze his
hat was lost his clothing was
dusty and disheveled as if he
had striven for his life hand to
land it did not come into his thoughts to
inquire whether he had passed through the
fight unwounded it was enough that he
was not conscious of any pain

  it seemed to him that a profound silence
had settled over his lonely homestead  that
the three men riding like thieves in all
haste down the creek had snatched some-
thing away from him neither tlie nature
nor value of which he was fully conscious
of leaving him altogether unlike what he
had been only a little while before

  how long before how long had that
battle lasted not a great while scarcely
more than a few minutes he calculated
it was daylight when they woke him in
tiieir efforts to pull his house down the
sun was only making a far-off candle-flare
on the horizon now it would be almost
an hour yet until sunrise and he had
killed a man

  it gave him a shocking start to think of
it that way the sun an hour away yet and
he had killed a man what connection
there was in the peculiarly divided thought
he did not know nor trouble to adjust

  there was a great stillness over the grassy
  valley a growing fear in his breast couldi
  he justify the killing of that man to au-j
  thority when it came to inquire couldi
  he justify it to himself

    there was a sickening feeling of revul-
  sion for the whole unfortunate adventure
  the pitiful things which he had there toi
  defend were not worth the life of any man
  were not worth the upbraidings of con-
  science the years of regret this mornings 
  hot-headed work would cost it had taken
  this tragedy to adjust his sense of values
  before the fight he had believed his posi-
  tion unassailable by the most exacting mor-
  alist among mankind now it looked as
  if the whole project had been founded on
  a wrong conception what was the home-
  stead worth to him now he had shed blood
  to defend it how far would public opin-
  ion in that one-man country support him
  in his defense

    it was a troublesome thing an appalling
  thing to rise up and confront a man he
  had reasoned that the united states gov-
  eminent would stand behind hku in the
  defense of his rights would it do so
  what was the united states government
  but an oligarchy of influence

    rawlins withdrew a distance from tlie
  trampled scene of his dooryard and sat
  down on a little rise behind the house he
  was beginning to sweat and palpitate in the
  heat of doubt and fear that his disturbed

 rnagination generated the raiders had
 jisappeared in the hills heading for the
 nearest camp he believed to gather re-
 nt orcements and come back it wuold
 not be their way to give it up

   in case they came back what should he
 do would it be wiser to jump his horse
 when he saw them coming and leave it to
 them or stand and fight as he had begun 
 there was no answer to it forthcoming at
 that moment he thought hed better look
 around and find his hat

   as he turned to go about this errand so
 trivial in the grim business of that day
 rawlins saw somebody approaching rid-
 ing hard edith stone there was no
 doubt about it pie knew her manner of
 riding and he knew the horse he went
 to meet her running in his desire to stop
 her before she came in sight of the dead
  man lying in that stretched straining pos-
 ture his face against the ground

   edith arrived in a flurry of dust lean-
ing eagerly as she came on she was pale
 and frightened there was a fearful look in
 her eyes

   oh they didnt they didnt she

 gasped catching her breath with open
 mouth the sound of it like a sob

 no said rawlins stupidly

 he was standing with the rifle under his
 arm pale and dazed-looking

 i saw them up there-saw them through
 the field-glasses she shuddered

 es he seemed to agree clogged and
 heavy in his understanding

 what happened to you ned  are you
 hurt 

 she flung out of the saddle confronting
 him in fresh concern

 no not hurt

 what happened ned  what did they
 do

 they tried to drag my house down and
 i shot a man hes up there hes dead i
 shot him

 oh well she said looking at him curi-
 ously what could they expect  they
 came here huntin trouble didnt they

 you must not go up there he said in
 terrible earnestness you must go back
 home

 you dont want to let em get your
 nerve that way neel she admonished

what has happened before

 eorge washington ogden has written several of the most popular serials which
short stories has ever printed painting for us pictures varying from those of old-time cali-
 fornia of the road to monterey to the kansas cowtown doings of the cow jerry in
 sheep limit he draws a picture of a youngster from kansas who knowing nothing of condi-
tions farther west decided to go in for sheep raising this young rawlins had simply put his
 finger on a portion of a map and decided that there was the place he would take up a homestead
and graze his sheep in the best of pastuies of the prejudices feuds and no-trespass ideas of the
 cattlemen of his chosen district he knew nothing-but he was to learn

    first he ran into a long wire fence around the very district of the northwest he had so confi-
i dently chosen from the map and found that cattle interests had the country closed off with the
 various sheepherders of the neighborhood looking longingly across the wires but powerless to claim
their rights rawlins is taken on as a hand with airs lila duke widow of a sheepman and a
- huge sheep oner in her own right rawlins idea is to learn the business while with mrs duke
mthcn go in for raising sheep on his own this plan is upset by mrs dukes suddenly marrying
a what the people of the country jocularly call a mail order beau and this peck an ex-tailor out
wo get as much money from the widow as he can has  use for rawlins who sees through rum
too well so rawlins loses his job and peck is installed at the duke sheep ranch much resented by

tippy mrs dukes overseer and edith her niece rawlins is still determined to buck the cattle
interests and enters into a long correspondence with his congressman in an endeavor to hnd out by
what right this large tract of land is being held the satisfaction in that quarter is none so he
rputs the congressmans letter in his pocket and files a homestead claim on that corner of the dt y
 wood range where the guarded fence stretched league upon league barring the homeless trom
tthcir inheritance and their rights		 

    rawlins tries to enlist the help of other sheepmen of the country in his endeavor to iorce nis
 rights in the cattle country but without success al of tliree weeks pass quietly after kawlms
 rtakes up his abode inside sheep limit and nothing happens so he prematurely begins to nave a
 carefree feeling then rawlins is summarily ordered off by the foreman of the ram whose
 owner has fenced in what is really open range but still lie refuses to leave both mrs i ec 
 edith are pessimistic about what will happen to him if he defies the order to move but ne s
 -ntains that he will stand by his rights then he finds that lus feeling of satety was

short stories

her own composure regained come on
down to the creek and wash your face-
youll feel better then

  she took him by the arm and led him
down to the waters edge her horse fol-
lowing the animal sprawled its fore-
legs and drank gratefully from the shallow
stream while edith took the rifle and raw-
lins bent down to refresh himself accord-
ing to her counsel

  didnt you meet them he asked with
a start asif the thought had frightened
him the water wasting through his cupped
hands	

  they turned off into the lulls go
ahead and wash

  he obeyed in a spiritless way as if noth-
ing mattered now lie had killed a man

  you knew you might have to shoot
some of them if you held your own she
said gently yet with a little hardness of
accusation or censure as if to say he had
failed in her expectations of him in not
standing up under it like a man

  it isnt so much a question of right as
of values he said looking up gravely
water streaming from his face

  this was puzzling to her and vexing
because she did not understand she
flushed frowning her displeasure

  did you know any of them was
hewitt there

  no hewitt wasnt with them but i
thought i recognized the man we had trou-
ble with that day at the fence

  yes he was apt to have a hand in it
were you in the house when they came
id been on the watch for them two
nights outside i must have dozed off-
they were at their devilment when i first
saw them

  rawlins pulled a deep sigh shaking his
head sorrowfully the weight of his tra-
gedy still pressing him down making his
senses blunt

  they came huntin trouble she re-
peated they got what was coinin to them
you act like youre sorry

   its an awful thing to kill a man over
an outcast chunk of ground like this he
said

  i dont suppose they tried to kill you
 don t suppose they even took a quiet lit-
tle hot or two at you to scare you off
he was going to bum the house hed
just struck a match when i-hed just
struck a match

  what did you want to spoil his inno-
cent little joke for if its going to make
you feel so sick she asked out of pa-
tience with his uocked and shaken state

didnt they shoot at you 

  i expect maybe they did edith he

plied

  you expect maybe they did she sai
with scornful reproach look here

  she took hold of his shirt-sleeve on ti e
side toward his body near the arm-pit
showing him a bullet hole rawlins looked
at the place curiously and tucked it under
his arm to hide it apparently ashamed tj
have his past peril known he muttered
something that she did not understand
holding his arm tight against his side

  two or three inches over and it would
have been your heart instead of your
sleeve she said and you stand there
like you wanted to apologize for them
what are you goin to do when they come
back with hewitt to wipe vou off the
earth

  there was an insolent challenge in her
demand

  come back with hewitt  he repeated
stretching his eyes as if the thing had an
astonishing sound his face darkened
with a rush of hot blood he stood feed
wide apart clenching his lists damn
them ill fight them to a finish

  youre all right now honey she said
a tremor in her voice she looked at him
smiling a twisted little smile

  its my property its my home even
if it dont amount to much ill defend itj
down to the last kick there is in me

  he stepped over briskly and picked u
his gun scraping the trickling drops of hi
late ablution from his cheek with the rim
of his hand

  yes i knew you would she said id
like to stick around and help you ned if
youll let me

  you can help me more edith if youll
cut across to lost cabin and send the sher-
iff and coroner over here he said they
had a double turn of rope around my
shack- indignantly pounding the air in
denunciation of the outrage-with four
horses hitched to it trying to drag it down
its there yet-the sheriff can see it

  if you think id better go ned she
consented

  somebodyll have to go and  cant
leave it to them to come hack here and fin-
ish it off have you got anything to cut
the wire

  i always carry something to cut the
wire

  bring the sheriff in the short way-if
hes got the nerve to come

  she nodded starting up the bank for her
horse he caught her arm

                                                       to
sheep

   ride around the house lie said giv-
ing tier a straight
meaning look
she nodded
again going on

  rawlins went
up the erfeek to
unsaddle grabau
and turn him out
in a liobble see-
ing no remote ex-
igency that would
impel him to de-
sert his homestead now he was ex-
hilarated by his recovery from his dazed
oppression of spirits

   that was a pretty decent sort of sher-
iff a sheepman kind of sheriff what-
ever influence senator galloway had in
politics generally around there his foot
must have slipped in the election of that
man so rawlins thought that morning
when the sheriff arrived in quick time
after ediths summons the coroner coming
along more deliberately with a proper con-
veyance for carrying off the wreckage of
the fight

   that -was about all there was to it the
sheriff said looking with keen interest at
the double rope around the house with the
outrunning lariats lying as they had been
cast off if a gang of cusses came to shoot
a mans home up hed be a damn fool if he
didnt shoot back rawlins had done a
mans job and that was about all there was
to it as far as the sheriff could see

   the coroner arrived in due time bring-
ing with him a jury of sheepmen being an
expedient man and determined to have the
case investigated and disposed of on the
ground the inquest was held over the
slain man where he lay with the half-
burned match beside liis fingers the
whole proceeding did not occupy more than
ten minutes the jury not only finding raw-
lins justified but commending him warmly
for his defense of his rights which was
they said in no small measure the defense
of the public rights too long defied in the
dry wood country

   the inquest over these- sheepmen cast
their calculative eyes around the country
knowing themselves safe in their official
position taking advantage of the event to

i	do a little locating against some future day

i	when a little extra range would be handy

   edith hung back out of the proceedings
until they had lifted the body into the
wagon and covered it with a sheep-herders

i	tent then she came over to shake hands

i	with rawlins as the rest of the -sheepmen

di m it	g

had done and do the liest she could to
make it appear that killing a man tmder
the proper circumstances was nothing to
worry over or remember with remorse

  the sheepmen all knew edith for fifty
or sixty miles was a small matter between
neighbors in dry wood in those times it
is just about the same even today they
talked about the drouth and kicked the
ground judiciously turning up the soil to
note its qualities and chewed pieces of
hay from rawlins stacks making quite a
neighborly reunion out of it the dead
man in the wagon was the smallest part of
their thoughts

  not so with rawlins after the coroner
the jurymen and the sheriff had gone back
to lost cabin taking the short cut across
galloways land for the first time in their
lives and edith had ridden away to the
ranch to relieve whatever anxiety her aunt
might feel over her unexplained absence
it would take a long time to wear the hide-
ous accusation from his own conscience
the upbraiding that it might have been
avoided

  an unworthy man an outlawed man a
vicious and murderous villain yet he
had been htiman worth more at his basest
evaluation than the little oblong of semi-
arid land that a perverse infatuation had
urged this sheep-mad stranger from afar
to enter upon in peril and attempt to hold
in strife

  there would not be much in that life
hiding out of a night that way like a cat
to wake soon or late with the bold chal-
lenge of fire in his eyes this resistance
this first success would only embitter them
lending vengeance to their other griev-
ances fancied or contrived

  so rawlins reasoned as lie made his bed
in the buffalo wallow that night not in
the intention of standing sentinel over his
possessions again for he was weary to the
ljone let them come when they would
and do what they might if he could not
wake in time to stop them if it came to a
battle again he would stick to his hole and
give them the best he had even the
sheepmen who plainly expected much of
him could not demand more

chapter xx

a forehanded shepherd

it was not the gleam of fire on his
eyeballs nor the sound of guns in his
ears that woke rawlins when morn-
ing was breaking gray over the slieep-
lands he heaved himself up suddenly
short stories

when the sound of it struck through his

heavy slumber

  sheep the tremulous pleading help-
less babble of a band of sheep

  rawlins took a cautious peep through
the fringe of his hiding-place seeing noth-
ing of the complaining creatures which
seemed to be near at hand in large num-
bers there was a fog in the valley or a
skim of fog which pressed close to the
ground common to that valley in theearly
morning rawlins often had seen it be-
fore so shallow that the tops of the taller
cottonwoods along the creek protruded
above it the sheep were bleating out of
it beyond the creek none of them was to
be seen

  he came out of his hole cautiously re-
lieved to see his house and haystacks still
there he wondered whether this was a
new scheme of galloways men running
their flocks over to his valley hoping to
drown him in sheep or whether the herd-
ers had acted on orders predicated on the
certainty that he would be ousted by that
time it was a trespass any way they had
worked it for the sheep were on his land
he intended to send them out of there in
short order he wasnt going to have
sheep in there ruining his hay crop

  making a stealthy circuit of his prem-
ises rawlins encountered the sheep un-
der the creek bank where he had tied his
horse the day before along there the
bank was high on one side of the stream
only the other being a pebbly slope which
high water covered at its present low
stage the stream pressed against this high
bank only three or four yards wide the
pebbly shore making a sort of sheltered
nook very good for a bedding-ground
here the shepherds had brought their
sheep while he slept either ignorant of
their proximity to his house or assured in
their belief that all was safe

  what puzzled rawlins was that no
shepherd was in sight no smell of his
breakfast fire on the air it is a law among
sheepherders of the northwest that flocks
must be moved from the bedding-ground at
dawn faced into the wind and spread to
graze while the dew is on the herbage by
careful attention to this rule of the craft
a flock is able to subsist for many days
without water it saves the shepherd
labor and the sheep flesh in long drives to
tanks and streams

  there was no voice of sheep-herder ris-
ing in the age-old cry that marshaled the
sheep forth from the bedding-ground
there was no shepherd to be seen not

even a dog to bristle and give the alarm of
the peering strangers presence it was
mystifying to rawlins who did not care
to push his investigations too far

  he would wait until the fog cleared as
it would with the first spears of sunlight
lancing over the hills it was lucky the
sheep had not come into his uncut grass
which stood knee-high ready for the
scythe they would have done great dam
age trampling there for it was a middling
big band a thousand or more from what 
he could see there was nothing to do but i
wait and act according to what should be l
revealed

  rawlins went back to the house which 
he had not examined for intruders think- i
ing the herder or herders might have taken 
possession and be sleeping late on account 
of the unaccustomed luxury of a bed be- j
neath a roof there was nobody in the 
house it remained just as he had left it 
yesterday the hay on the floor where the i
incendiary had thrown it the broken glass i
from the window littering the ground he 
had not thought it worth while in his tin-
certain state to right things up around the j
place there might be something bigger
to come off around there yet which would
muss things up even more

  it was assuring at any rate to find
things undisturbed uneasy as he was
over the presence of the sheep he was 
strongly tempted to make a hre in the
stove and get breakfast but instead re-
turned to the creek where he sat down
overlooking the flock to wait the breaking
of the fog

  the sheep were huddling and crying be-

                       low him lambs i

                    breakfast not
                    much cocctned i

                          clense fog mak- j
ing rifts in it here and there opening mo- 
raentary vistas through one of these rifts i
rawlins had a glimpse of a dog sitting in i
stolid patience on the farther rim of the
flock it was a big white-breasted animal j
morose in its pose

  rawlins got up a creepiness of appre- j
hension crinkling over him it was not a 
stray flock as he had begun to believe the
herder was somewhere near tired from his
labor of the night in bringing the band into

                                                        
sheep

the disputed pasture as he turned and
peered the quickening wind came with a
rush down the creek dispersing the fog
in a breath revealing what he sought

 the herder was lying beyond the dog
ridiculously covered across the middle part
f his body by a blanket and the canvas of
is little tent rawlins first amazement
gave way to humor he chuckled as he
hastened down the creek bank and struck
icross the shallow stream for there was
not a double of that long figure in the dry
ivood country it was the romantic form
f dowell peck

  the dog backed off bristling silent as
rawlins approached the sleeping keeper of
he flock it retreated within a few yards
f its master where it crouched ready to
epel any intrusion on his weary slumber
rawlins did not care to test the creatures
idelity any further he stood where he
vas and let out a whoop that brought
peck up in a comical tangle of blanket and
ent

 peck had a gun and was making a two-
landed effort to haul it out of the scab-
ard when rawlins yelled to him
i its rawlins he called dont you
mow me

  pecks long hair was over his eyes his
ng mustache drooped in dejection like a
vet roosters tail he cleared his coun-
enance of the fog-damp locks one hand
i till distrustfully on his gun

 oh all right rawlins he said his

	oice hoarse and rough-edged from sleep
-come on over

 rawlins went up the gravelly strand
opening a way through the flock water
overflowing his boots he was carrying
ris rifle a pistol buckled on him for he
 ad crawled out of the buffalo wallow ex-

	ecting a fight peck kicked the encum-
lering covers aside with a gay leg caper-
fflg joyously

i i was headin for you and i hit you
iseck called over the diminishing distance
yfurty dang good for a greenhorn in the
gght ill say

 darned good i call it rawlins
shouted back over the confusion of the
seep but what the devil does it mean 
ow did you get here-where are you go-

 right here peck replied sticking out
s long arm in greeting i started for
jbht where im at and  got here

 you certainly did rawlins marveled
jpu how did you do it  whats the ob-

jwcll i tell you rawlins them dang

limit	

sheep theyre more to blame than me in
the first place if they hadnt started it i
never would a thought of it or if i had
thought of it thatd wen the end of it i 
guess they run away a couple of days
ago and i couldnt stop em they was
wild-eyed for a drink i guess they hadnt
had one for two or three weeks

  oh they bolted on you did they 
they sure did i couldnt no more
stop em than i could a freight train we
struck a hole in that dang fence where
you come in at i guess and i shot em
through i saw your house from the top
of a hill out there and i said theres where
id break away from the old woman and
take a little stake along with me we hit
that hole about sundown and i kep them
dang stews on the trot till midnight

  peck youre a wonder rawlins com-
mended him in genuine praise but how
did you know youd hit my place you
couldnt see it from this side of the creek
i knew youd be on a crick all sheep-
mens nutty about cricks and when i
struck it i stopped i was goin to take a
look around for you this morning

  but what possessed you to bring that
band of sheep in here peck dont you
know theres a war going on between me
and galloways gang

  let em come said peck with porten-
tous confidence slapping his gun im
with you

  what will your wife say when she
hears youve run that band of sheep in
here

  id like to hear said peck comforta-
bly

  shell raise the roof

  let her said peck easy in his mind
there wont be anybody but her for it to
fall back on

  things are kind of uncertain in here
peck mighty uncertain to tell you the
truth darned if i know what youre go-
ing to do with that big band of sheep

  im goin to run em around in here and
fatten em up then ill sell em and hit the
breeze peck announced i had that all
figgered out when i was shootin em
through that hole in the fence the old
lady shell not bother me here shes a-
scairt to set her leg inside of that wire
fence and i tell you right now rawlins
id ruther stand up and fight seventeen
men a day than live around where that wo-
man can git at me

  well keep the band on this side of the
creek rawlins directed and youll be
all right with me ive got a nice patch of


short stories

hay over on the other side i want to cut

  sure peck agreed and sent his dog
to turn the sheep away from the creek

  t want to bum some breakfast off of
you and git you to hold me up a few days
till  can put me in some grub peck said
putting it up as a proposal between equals
no favor asked and no thought of being
denied

  youye welcome right up that bank-
you can see the tops of my haystacks over
there-when youre ready fi go cm and
get things started

   peck came to the lnuse in due time car-
rying his scanty bedding and scrap of tent
he tlirew them down with contemptuous
air kicked them into a corner and grunted
with disdain

  thats what a mans wife gives him to
lay his hones on and put over his head in
the night he said any hired man of
hers has got his wagon or his good tent
and plenty of grub brought to him right
along

  i see she gave you a gun she must be
loosening up a little

  all the gun she ever give me peck
discounted drawing the weapon from the
scabbard presenting it proudly for in-
spection i bought that oil of old man
clemmons-i give him four stews for it
shell carry a mile

   its an old-tiraer peck but it looks like

a good one can
you hit any-
thing with it 
sometimes
peck confessed
ingenuous-
ly but ill bet
yu the pop i
can throw a bluff with it as big as any man
around here

  i dont believe it would pay you to
try it inside of galloways fence peck
when you pull your gun here you want to
begin to shoot theyre not much on the
muff you know i thought theyd run
that band of sheep in on me i took it so
much for granted i never thought to look
at the brand

  youll see another brand on em before
long im goin to cut me a stencil out of
a coal oil can and print capital peck on the
sides of them stews a foot high ill let
that old woman see whos boss of this
gang

  maybe youve got a right to claim em
peck i dont know much about the law
in such matters

  sure i have what belongs to the

wife belongs to the husband but what

husband gits his paws on is his ltb
lo be that way in this case i dont give
dang what the law says

  they sat at breakfast rawlins with on

leg in the door his guns at hand wat
against a suqjrise over across the
pecks sheep could be seen making
cheerful picture in a landscape that j
hns had found empty to loneaomencss
the lays past

  youve got a nice hand of them tliere
he said

  yeah peck agreed with the easy off-
hand way of a regular sheepman its a
good joke on the old woman the way d
loaded me up with that band of sh
rawlins you know riley the feller rl
had the law books in his wagon y

 was talkin to riley one day about gittii
a divorce off of die old woman i nit he
i didnt liave much of a show a man
to watch his step not to give his wife
openin for a knockout riley said he
me have a book on divorces said if ii
read that and study up and walk a straij
line i might be able to flop her one
these days tippie come by one day at
caught me readin that book

  i heard about it

  yeah she was red-headed she coni
learin over to my camp next day and sa
she married me for keeps then she wen
over and fired riley right off the lut
she split his sheep up among us other hire
hands cornin out ahead one man on thr
deal the way she figgered it i liad autr
four hundred before that she loaded
up with six or seven hundred more shi
said shed give me somethin to think abon
besides divorces she was goin to make i
sheepman out of me or kill me a-trysti
-glad she loaded me up with them extrs
stews now im just that much ahead i
darned if i see how youre going tc
come out on it peck but i wish you luck
i suppose youve got a right to sell tht
sheep if you want to but i doubt if any
body around here would buy them froi
you	

  im goin to ship em to kansas city
when them lambs grows a little more 
think ill go over to the bank at lori
cabin and see if i cant raise a little loan
on em if i can ill hire some feller to
do the work no sheepman that herds his
own sheep ever amounts toanything raw-
lins no more than any other business man
that tries to do it all himself

  youre not far wrong there peck
rawlins agreed

                                                          in
  what busted your winder rawlins
peck suddenly inquired coming alive to his
outward surroundings now that his inner
void was filled and his opinions aired
looks like youd clean up this shack a lit-
tle what do you want hay th rowin
around on the floor that way for you
been feedin your horse in here

  i mentioned to jou a while ago that
theres a war going on between me and
some of galloways men they came here
yesterday morning to tear my house down
they kicked in the window and tried to
bum it after theyd failed to upset it with
ropes that accounts for the muss i
havent had time to clean up

   what the doodle was you doin to let
em bust your winder that way peck
wanted to know with an uncharitable chal-
lenge

  i did the best i could peck rawlins
replied sighing as with a sad regret

chapter xxi

a profane wish

that day passed as peacefully as if
no question of a homesteaders
rights inside the fence ever had been
raised rawlins was under a heavy strain
which relaxed in some degree as evening
fell and peck gathered his sheep in a lit-
tle bowl which seemed to have been
ordered by nature to meet this exigency
pecks bedding-ground was about half a
mile beyond the creek  rawlins land
where the new proprietor of the flock
spread his canvas over a bush and crawled
under it to his repose after smoking an
aftersupper pipe with rawlins

  pecks attitude toward sheep had under-
gone a radical transformation he had
now all the zeal of a proprietor handling
the flock as if he had a personal interest
in the welfare of the weakest of them
showing a surprising craftiness for his
short apprenticeship on the range he
itvas planning to go to lost cabin the next
lay and see about raising a loan on the
flock off there to himself inside gal-
loways fence peck felt that he had put an
insurmountable barrier between himsel f
ijand his wife

  rawlins did not encourage this propri-
etary view nor the flight into finance which
heck proposed tr try he was greatly dis-
turbed by pecks invasion of his valley
with the sheep and troubled over the pros-
pcct of being blamed by mrs peck for
harboring her runaway husband even if
she did not charge him with connivance in



the entire plot it would be difficult to
convince the lady with her present low es-
timate of pecks initiative and resourceful-
ness that he had brought the flock inside
galloways fence alone

  the wise thing to do rawlins concluded
after he had seen peck stowed away under
his bush for the night was to go and in-
form mrs peck of her husbands adven-
ture w hile this course might appear
treasonable to peck for whom rawlins
was beginning to feel a little sympathy and
kindness it was only just to himself

  aside from putting himself in the way
of being blamed by mrs peck the pres-
ence of the sheep at his place would add to
his own complications galloway would
come down on him hard for this apparent
publication to all sheepland that the limit
was off for sheep in dry wood rawlins
secret hope was that mrs peck would
move in the matter at once and take the
sheep home

  rawlins felt that it was safe to leave
things unguarded for a while at night
after galloways men had been shown his
determination to hold his own there they
would not be likely to risk an assault by
night in which all the advantage would be
his hewitt had not been with them it
was likely they were awaiting him or at
least instructions from him before mak-
ing another move

  so concluding he saddled graball and
rode to the ranch hoping as he went along
to find tippie there tippie could return
with him they could take an early start
and have the sheep outside the fence by
sunrise

  edith was at the gate a saddled horse
standing by the house was dark and
silent as rawlins rode up and dis-
mounted edith flung the gate open eag-
erly greeting him with relief

  i was about to start over there and see
if i could find out anything she said i
didnt get to go up the hill today i was
worried about you ned

  its been as quiet- as sunday up there
today edith im beginning to think
theyre going to let me alone

  the little paring of moon was very
bright cheering the whole sector of the
sky where it seemed to hang not much
more than the height of a man above the
hills rawlins could see the anxiety of
her face as she shook her head slowly in
denial	 

  you know theyre not going to sne
said then quickly as if her words had
been waiting give it up ned give it up-

sheep limit


short stories

it isnt worth another fight it isnt worth

what youve gone through already let
them have it-give it op

  no im not going to give it up he
replied with argumentative briskness i
did think of doing it as you know to ray

disgrace and--	 

  no no she protested remembering

her own scorn

  but ive got over all that after the

sheriff had been
there after my
talk with him
and those sheep-
men i felt all
right i was
i shaken at first-
nearly shaken
loose from my
grip theres more at stake for me there
than my homestead now edith theres
every principle of justice and manhood
id be a coward to quit it now

  i urged you on she said repentantly
i was always blowin about a man that
would come along some day with nerve
enough to open that country i was proud
of you when you went in but i didnt
think youd ever have to kill anybody i
didnt think theyd crowd you that far
now theyll kill you to even it up theyre
not the kind to let it drop now

  its going to be all right he assured
her and took her hand chafing it consol-
ing it by his caress as one comforts a child
for a hurt

  there never had leen any courting be-
tween these two in the sense that homely
word is generally understood rawlins
did not know just what his feeling toward
edith was at the best a sort of hopeful
perhaps a bit wistful friendship very like
his feeling toward that country where he
had taken up his claim there was some-
thing big to be done before he could call
it his own

  youth has its way of adjusting these
things without many words and in that
way the case stood without words between
rawlins and edith stone

  its going to be all right rawlins re-
peated rubbing it in her hand like a lini-
ment everythings going to be all right
has your aunt gone to bed

   no she s not here weve had a sen-
sation of our own here today ned what
do you think pecks run away again and
not only run away but taken a band of
eleven or twelve hundred sheep along with
him aunt lilas out on the range hunt-
ing them now-especially the sheep i

peck sheep dog and

was with her all day but we didnt

trace of them

  thats what ive come over about
rawlins said the shake of a laugh in h

words

  have you seen him

  i left him not an hour ago hes over

there with me

peck 

sure enough

all

  peck of all men taking a band of
sheep into that country-peck 

  to peck and nobody else the honor
belongs well die sheep must be given
some credit for initiating the movement 
must admit peck says they ran away
from him or with him and came to the
hole in the wire when he shot em throng
and headed for my place hed spotted it
from the hills

  and hes in there

he seems to be very much at home
he says hed rather fight men every day
than face his wife once in a while hes
got a gun a yard long hanging on him 
peck

  the surest thing you know he says
he can hit things with it sometimes and i
believe him so well id want to lie back of
something thick when he turns it loose
edith ljegan to laugh in spite of herself
its no laughing matter young lady
he said with pretense of great severity to
have him on your liands with twelve hun-
dred sheep more or less ive got trou-
bles enough of my own without your dear
old uncle dowell i dont want him and
his sheep around there

  and he wont leave edith gasped with
merriment the poor man wants to stay
there where he can fight his way in peace
and not have to study divorce books and
have his mustache pulled

  you unfeeling little rascal said raw-
lins hand on her shoulder then he went
a little farther and embraced her quiver-
ing shoulders dragging her close as if to
compress the laughter out of her

  can you imagine elmer trailing arouna
after peck  hes in the mountains the
girl said drawing away but with no trace
of resentment

  i hoped i might get him to go back with
me and start that band of sheep out of
there at daylight

  what if uncle dowell pulled his gun
and said no

  he might do it too hes got his plans
made away ahead for that bunch of sheep
do you know wliat he calls them  stews
sheep limit

  aunt lila told me but im afraid that
st loe brand of humor failed to make a
great big hit with her

the question is will she go after him
 wonder shes always had a mortal
rerror of that fence thats why i had to
stop cuttin it she used to be in agony
every time i went after the mail

  my worry is that shell implicate me in
pecks break for liberty especially as im
harboring him but i was as much sur-
prised to see him as shell be to hear hes
there

  i dont think shell blame you ned
but it certainly will jolt her when she finds
out where hes gone what kind of plans
is he making for the sheep ned 

  im afraid theyre all disloyal to the
hand that married him he says hes go-
ing to put a mortgage on them for one
thing to raise money for hiring somebody
to do the work while he does the thinking
im afraid mr peck hinted darkly that he
intended to drive them out and ship them
to kansas city as soon as the lambs were a
little heavier but i think wed just as well
keep that between us it wouldnt con-
tribute to harmony between mr and mrs
peck if she recaptures him which i feel
shes bound to do

f you wouldnt think that worm had
sense enough to plan it all out that way
like a regular man would you edith
laid im beginning to think theres hope
for him after all

 hes developing sheepmanly traits
fight along i was surprised to see it but
jits true maybe the guns got something
to do with it

i of course shell get him if he ever
breaks out of there and hell have to come
out when you leave ned
r but rawlins had no intention of leav-
ing with that friendly sheriff only a few
rmiles away and those eager sheepmen
iftround lost cabin waiting the hour to
feme in he no longer felt himself unsup-
ported and alone those sheepmen were
flcady to jump the day they felt it a litrle
ss than half way safe rawlins had seen
 hat sticking out of them like pumpkins in
 sack when they sat as jurors in the cor-
ners inquest a little while if he could
ld on and there would be neighbors
hough to carry everything inside the
pence

 i wish i was a man edith sighed

 im glad wishing cant make you one
  rawlins told her

  well i do she insisted stubbornly
  but maybe i can help you anyway



  whatever opportunity this offered for
saying something gallant rawlins allowed
to pass untouched for sincerity has a slow

tongue

  do you expect mrs peck home to-
night he asked after the chance for say-
ing something that he knew should have
been said and was expected to be said had
fallen flat

  she was headin for clemmons range
when i left her if she dont hear any-
thing of her sheep down there-and of
course shell not-i expect shell turn back
home it may be morning before she gets
here

  they discussed the probability of mrs
pecks invasion of the forbidden territory
edith being of the opinion that the chances
were all in pecks favor it was impos-
sible for her to see anything tragic shaping
up in the situation for peck the comedy
outweighing everything else

  the moon was touching the hills when
rawlins left her lighter of heart and
stronger of hope than when he came dan-
ger was drawing away from him he be-
lieved  peace was about to descend on his
valley where the price it had cost him al-
ready was marked by the brown splotch in
the white earth before his door

chapter xxii

a man at last

peck was up at daylight next morn-
ing whooping in high and exultant
voice as he spread his sheep to graze
in due and ancient form he was in high
feather when he came to the house for
breakfast to find that his industry sur-
passed rawlins if early rising was to be
taken as a measure he found the home-
steader sitting on the edge of his cot yawn-
ing away the dregs of sleep

  rawlins had chanced a surprise by sleep-
ing in the house going  the argument
by which he had convinced himself last
night that they were due to leave him alone
the peaceful morning pecks cheerful
countenance in the door the feeling of
eagerness to be up and at it all contrib-
uted to strengthen the belief that un-
troubled days were before him he set
peck to making a fire in the sheet-iron
stove while he assembled biscuit materials
designing to begin that felicitous morning
with the first good meal in two days

  peck stood on his knees before the lit-
tle stove regulating the damper to con-
trol the roaring fire he had made chuckling
to himself in what rawlins took to be the


excess

short stories

of spirits ill his unaccustomed b-

was just a-thinkin rawlins peck

said twisting his long neck to took round
 l fired you one time didnt i 

  you bet vou did reck

yeah that was one thing i made stick

with the old woman hut  was a new rat-
tle to her then well  tell you rawlins
im goin to he a feller that can hire em
and lire em as last as they come in the fu-
ture days to come im clone with that
woman she aint got money enough
stacked up to coax one leg back to that
ranch

it was best not to say anything to peck
about his wifes hot hunt for him on the

range or the
mystery his dis-
appearance had
been to every-
b o d y outside
peck would be
better off for
knowing noth-
ing of the trip
to the ranch last
night at least he
would be easier
in his mind

  i was just a-
thinkin rawlins where id a been at if
i hadnt fired you that time and where
youd a been at too i give you a start
by firin you and made a place for myself
to light when i come to the jump-off im
darned glad i fired you that time raw-
lins

  it does look like it was for the best all
around doesnt it well i never held it
against you i wasnt very much stuck
on working as a herder for your wife or
anybody else

  yes it was best for me and good for
you as the song says that bunch ought
to clean me up thirty-five hundred maybe
four thousand freight and everything paid

thatll set me up-

  they both broke for the door rawlins
dropping his breakfast preparations and
peck his speculations there was a hurst
of shooting an outbreak of yells across
the creek in the direction of pecks sheep
i erk made it into the open first where he
turned his face white his crawfish eyes
wild

its them fence tellers-theyre killin
my sheep git your gun and come on
peck streaked away like a hound with
the last word never looking back to see
whether rawlins was going to support him

in the battle or leave him to the defense
his flock alone he was out of siglit u

the creek bank when rawlins came
with his rifle

  four men were stirring confusion ar
the sheep the witless animals contri
mg to their own destruction by crow
together in bunches rawlins liel
these were the four men whom he had
pulsed two days ago come back to adi
the account he hurried on to ov
peck not so much because he counted
him to be of any use but to keep him
rashly exposing himself

  peck was across the creek loping upftfe
gravelly shore where he had bedded ini
flock the night he arrived the fence
riders who were dubbing and shooting live
sheep had not seen peck although he nb
making no effort at all to conceal liimsdi
tearing toward his abused flock gun
his concern for his property so gr
had no thought of danger

  rawlins paused on the high batik
be had a vantage from which he could
worked great and sudden damage a
the slaughterers of the flock holding 
fire on account of peck the new fl
roaster suddenly grown valiant in his
erty and property rights was at 
hundred yards in the lead but still
more than a pistol-shot distant from
nearest rider working havoc among
sheep rawlins knew die raiders ca
rifles it would be a small matter to
peck flat at that distance with one v
put shot-	

  down the bank through the shaikh
stream and after peck the homestead
charged heavy with the water that fille-
his boots sagged down by the ammunitiff
he had loaded every available pocket witi
yelling to peck to lie down and wait ji
peck heard he didnt even look badl
straight toward his abused flock he werrl
his long legs straddling sage-cjumps a
taking them in clean leaps at least sen
enough in control above his roused an
loiiiug anger to know he couldnt do a
damage with his gun that far away

  when peck came within what he caj
culated as shooting range he sti
braced himself with legs spraddled wi
lifted his gun gripping it in both lian
and cut loose the roar of that anci
rim-fire forty-five drew the first notice
the fence-riders to the defenders of the
flock if they had seen peek and rawj
lins before that moment they evidently had
thought them still too far away to he taken
into account thev had been clubbing and

                                              
sheep limit

 shooting and riding into the huddling lit-
 tle bunches of sheep as if bound to do as
 jnuch destruction in the flock as possible
 before turning their attention to whoever
 was responsible for this insolent invasion

  they probably had concluded that raw-
lins or whoever was herding the sheep
had cut for safety at their approach it
was likely they had not counted on any-
body but rawlins having the effrontery
to bring sheep inside the fence a home-
steader who would shoot a man exercising
the feudal prerogative of burning his
shanty might even drive a band of sheep
inside the long-respected limit

 at the sound of pecks gun the man at
whom he had fired whirled around from
his atrocious slaughter yelling warning to
bis friends he threw down the club he
had been mauling the sheep with jerked
liis rifle from the scabbard under his leg
pinged a bullet so near pecks head that
rawlins saw him jerk it and duck as if a
lornet had come at him

   that only appeared to make peck hotter
 dn he went slinging his long legs over
 rush and gully waving his gun and yel-

 i ng

   rawlins tore along after him going with
 nore caution and considerably less speed
 touching like an indian as he dodged from
 ush to bush ready to pitch in a shot the
 loment he saw he could do any good the
 fthers began to peg away at peck who
 topped again legs braced wide as before
 un steadied in both hands head to one
 ide a little as he deliberately squinted and
 hned

  to the surprise of rawlins and no
staubt to the astonishment of the other side
-for it was a long pistol-shot-pecks
careful aim was good the man who was
pushing forward in a bearing of contemp-
tuous security rifle raised to throw down
tti a one-handed shot jerked back in the
saddle as if he had ridden into a rope
wretched across his way he rode on that
ay a little distance rifle and reins drop-
ped then slumped off to one side and fell
i pecks pause had brought rawlins up
within a few yards of him he made a
imprint and came alongside as peck was
growing his feet for another charge raw-
bns made a grab and caught the back of
fis jumper

 get behind something peck here
down with you-quick

  kawl-ins was down on elbows and knees
  ind a clump of sage with its little wart
  earth heaped and held around its deep-
  r iking wide-spread roots old peck
  



stood looking down at him curiously both
hands gripping his gun as if he did not
understand the reason for a man whose
valor he never had doubted up to that mo-
ment being in such a sweat to get some-
thing between himself and trouble

  the three sheep-killers were charging
up well spread out their shots cuttingthe
bushes over rawlins head he pulled
pecks leg wasting valuable time to get
the rascal brave in a simpletons ignorance
of his danger down out of that buzzing
hot stream of lead

  while rawlins hand was still gripping
pecks bony shin pecks legs gave way as
is he had been hamstrung he sank down
in a dazed groping way to his knees still
holding to his gun with one hand settled
slowly without a word or groan and lay
in a huddled bunch close beside rawlins
behind the little knuckle of earth

  rawlins did not know whether peck was
killed or seriously wounded there was
no blood but he had heard the bullet strike
there was no time to investigate or give
peck the assistance upon which his life if
life there was in him might depend the
sheep-killers were standing off not above
fifty yards their guns quiet since pecks
disaster spying cautiously around for sight
of rawlins who had not fired a shot it
was likely they thought the had got him
too

  now they came ahead cautiously to
close in and finish it if anything remained
to be done rawlins flattened down and
fired they gave it back to him hot and
fast

  there was a confusion of striking bul-
lets around him dust and smoke from his
gun at the next sight he had the middle
saddle was empty the horse was charg-
ing on straight toward him it passed in
terrified stampede so near the earth flung

up by its hoofs
showered h i m
where he lay

  the two re-
maining of the
band had no in-
tention of giv-
ing up the fight
for hewitt was
one of the m
rawlins saw
he had come to-
 day to close the
matter there
w o u l d be no
running away before a single man of the
homesteader breed again

shokt stories

  they separated wider sul to flank him
and drive him out rawlins drifted as the
bullets txa  cat in uma the side snak-
ing himsolf on bows reserving somefchiag
for the rush he worked himself a few
feet away from peck hoping the poor fel-
low might escape any further damage if
tliere was an ember of life in him still

  hewitt was on the right he came push-
ing in with steady determination holding
his restive horse down to a slow walk
rawlins resented his mean persistence he
slewed around threw his gun across pecks
body and tired with the jump of his
gun hewitt threw in a shot that got raw-
lins between elbow and wrist twirling the
rifle out of liis hands

  rawlins scrambled for pecks pistol
hewitt shouting to his companion both of
them rushing in for the finish rawlins
was rising to his feet pecks gun in his left
hand to have it out in a whirlwind close
the chances all against him as he knew too
well he was dazed his right arm was
numb and unresponsive it was a bad cor-
ner for a man to be caught in it was the
end

  hewitt was not twenty feet away pistol
lifted to throw down for the last shot
when a diversion was set up in the rear
somebody began to shoot somebody was
riding in headlong charge through tall
greasewood and sage with a wild high
whoop that raised the hair to hear raw-
lins took a left-handed chance shot at
hewitt as he whirled his horse and gal-
loped away

  whoever it was that had charged in that
desperate moment went on after the sheep-
killers the strident challenge sharp as a
steam siren cutting over the noise of quick
shooting rawlins stood on the little hump
of earth to see what there was to be seen
the sheep-jcillers were hitting it up in a
panic to get out of there the one in pur-
suit pulled up and looked around as if to
see if there were any more

  rawlins came down from the mound in
amazement which became double amaze-
ment on beholding peck sitting up looking
very pale and sack but far from a dead
man yet peck was staring with the big-
gest eyes rawlins ever had seen in a hu-
man head hands pressed to his belly
breathing m sharp little putts

  its your wife rawlins said wijdjv
excited peck peck i tell you its vour
wife

  he shook peck as if to wake him peck
looked up weakly

  she shot me peck gasped

  no no peck she saved us-she

us i tell you its your wife

  peck had no time for comment or
tion if lie liad the capacity or the i
for either mrs peck came tearing
flinging -herself from the saddle before
horse had answered her hard hand on
rein she was on her knees beside
in a moment his dazed head galh
against her bosom groaning over h
tears streaming dow-n her range-chal
face

  oh dowey darlin youre all shot
slithers she moaned oh why d
i git here sooner why-didnt-
here-sooner

  there was such a note of remorse a
accusation in her wail as to verify ra
lins in the belief he had held all the tiiu
that she was fond of peck and her liars
ness was only in effort to reshape him
fit a place of honor in the land of sheep

  where are you shot honey she
reclining peck tenderly his head on
lap

  here said peck pressing his st
ach rolling his bead from side to side
if the agony of his wound was beginning
make itself felt

  mrs peck began to explore with t
hand a doleful look of pity in her
face

  why there aint no hole in you there
she said gently greater relief than sur
in her voice

 slammed clean through me-
there peck insisted pulling his br
with a rattling sound

  mrs peck began to lay his anatomy ban
in her anxious explorations rawlins
account of the blood he was losing and th
pain of his own wound turned aside he
began making such repairs as a handker-
chief would provide relieved to see
artery was cut although one bone was
broken

  this gave him great concern involvi
the possibility as it did of losing part
his arm pi is anxiety over peck ivas
siding as that notables strength increa
and mrs peck declared there was no b
let hole in him peck resented this
daring he knew very well he was si
through the place to which his hand re-
turned with solicitous hovering he clo
ins eyes and lay with his mouth ope
groaning

  mrs peck removed the brooding 
after a gentle struggle and lent over for
a closer inspection of the spot

  there is a bruise there honey-its

 titmin purple and blue over a place as big
 as my hand she said wherever in the
 world could that bullet a went to what
 made it flatten out agiri you honey do
 you suppose i never heard of one doin
 that before youve got a charmed life
 pure as youre born youve got a charmed
 life

   what did you have in the pocket of
 your jumper peck rawlins inquired
 managing to grin although his arm hurl
 him as if it was under a w-agon wheel

   peck made a remarkable recovery when
 the investigation turned to the contents of
 his pocket he sat up with a jerk a red
 rush of resentment coming into his thin-
 edged face he put his wifes hand away
 rudely

   none of your dang business what i got
 in that pocket or any other pocket he
 said im my own man im goin to
 carry whatever i dang please in my pock-
 ets from now on

   why of course you can dowey darl-
 in mrs peck-said soothingly

   peck glowered around red veins in his
 wig glassy eyes looking savage and mean

   where in the hells my gun rawlins
 he asked

   there-your hats  it peck

   im goin over to find that feller i
 shot peck announced grabbing his gun

  getting up with as much iron in his legs as
 he ever had if he aint dead ill finish
  him-cornin in here killin off my sheep

   mrs peck looked at him with beaming
 admiration

    ill go with you darlinv she proposed

   youll stay where youre at till youre
  called for old lady peck put her in her
  place severely im goin to stir my own

 ildtfle of mush from now on

 all right dowey she yielded meekly
 happy in his mastery rawlins knew

   peck went on about his vengeful busi-
 ness mrs peck turning to rawlins as if

 	to share her admiration discovering his

 might

   why ned youre bleedin all over the
 k place she said here-let me see your
 f arm

   rawlins told her there was nothing more
 i to be done for temporary relief than what
 he had contrived already but that he would

 	ive grateful if she would allow him to ride

 	her horse to lost cabin to have the doctor

 i attend his hurt to which mrs peck heart-
 ily agreed

 she brought the animal up took the hol-
 ij tr with her two efficient pistols from the
 i saddle and urged himto go at once raw-



lins paused before mounting to thank her
ior her assistance in the moment of his ex-
tremity

  it would have been all over with us in
a minute more he said

  im sorry i didnt come sooner she
replied with the modesty of true valor
edith left me a note that mr peck was
over here with you but i didnt find it
till after breakfast i guess she went out
lookin for me  guess she was worried
when i was gone all night did he-

hesitantly her
eyes raised with
a timid eager-
ness he never
had seen in them
before-did he
shoot one of
them fellers
ned 

  he certainly
did he went
after them like a
hornet left me so far behind i thought id
never catch him youve got a man now
mrs peck a man right down to the back-
bone

  yes said mrs peck sighing hap-
pily ive got a man at last

another runaway

rawlins returned from lost
cabin before noon attended by
the sheriff and coroner the latter
official bringing with him the identical set
of sheepmen jurors that had served a few
days previously over the first victim of the
homesteaders war

  the coroner found a double job cut out
for him this time the raider who fell
before rawlins rifle in that mornings bat-
tle was not dead although shot through the
body he was a virile scoundrel with the
snakes tenacity of life in him and if the
coroner was disappointed in having the fel-
low as a subject for his official investiga-
tion he was compensated by getting him as
a patient peck had made a clean job of
it there was nothing left for the doctor
side of the coroner to do in his case

  that was undoubtedly the most enthusi-
astic verdict ever returned by a coroners
jury in the dry wood country it sounded
much like a resolution by a chamber of
commerce welcoming some new and im-
portant industry the presence of these
two bandy men holding their own against
great and -vicious odds inside senator a


short stories

loways fence that big band of sheep graz-
ing peacefully the morning s tern lying
visitation quite forgotten opened the gate
of possibility to a new and prolific range

  as before the sheriff had nothing but
praise for rawlins enlarged this time to
include peck whom he surveyed with a
perplexed look of questioning surprise
but he was discreet with complete con-
trol over his tongue no matter what his
thoughts he cast his eye around the coun-
try in sheepmanly appraisement

  mrs pecks pride in her valiant and effi-
cient husband was beyond all measure
whatever duke had done to build up the
fortunes and consequence of the family
before his unromantic end in the creek it
was reduced to a point in comparison with
pecks deeds peck had taken sheep be-
yond sheep limit he had broken the op-
pressors hand and battered down his wall

  that was the way mrs peck saw it at
least rawlins part in the venture was not
considered or if taken into account at all
only as a minor force in the historic event
of pecks sweeping invasion even the
sheep which had stampeded peck into this
glorious eminence against his power and
intention were not given the smallest
word of credit in her glowing praise

  after the coroners business was settled
and the official party had gone away mrs
peck transferred her saddle to graballs
back and returned to the ranch to fetch up
a wagon and supplies she and peck ap-
peared to have come to a complete under-
standing during rawlins absence nei-
ther of them had any intention of taking
the sheep out of that refreshing pasture
she was puffed up with the red arrogance
of a conqueror all her fears of the fence
and its lawless defenders had dissolved
she had a fighting man in the family now
who had made his place in that land of
dusty flocks

  mrs peck had put in the morning skin-
ning the sheep killed in the raid they had
found forty-three peck said several
more were crippled so badly they would
have to be killed cheap peck said echo-
ing his wifes declaration rawlins knew
 hat was a small price to pay for a pas-
ture that would take care of their sheep
shut out of the forest reservation by gov-
ernment restriction

    i  order tippie to bring em in
peck announced swelling around in the
double importance of large proprietor and
handy man with a gun

  they were at rawlins house which
peck from his grand air appeared to



think he had acquired by right of conquest
along with the rest of the territory inside
galloways fence rawlins was lying on
his cot feeling pretty well out of the game
on account of the pain in his arm peck
getting dinner ready

  hows your arm peck inquired turn-
ing suddenly as if it had just struck him to
inquire into the misfortunes of a man
whose part in that historic encounter had
been so unheroic and small

  pretty good peck

  you look kind of white around the
gills rawlins youd better take it kind of
easy for a while leave em to me if they
come back

  ill nearly have to old man

  yeah thatll be all right doctor say
hell have to take any bones out of you or
anything 

  no he says he can save my arm did
you help skin the sheep 

  yeah me and the old lady thought we
might as well save them hides-theyre
worth six bits apiece ill tell tippie to
bury them dead ones when he comes and
kill off the cripples and skin em me and

the old lady-

  did you find that bullet in your pocket
peck

  peck looked around again leaning on hi
long bony arms hands fiat in the pan hi
face was reproachful his animated coun t
tenance under a cloud of displeasure bu
he brightened up in a moment

  it was there all right rawlins hj
confessed it was smashed as flat on on
end as ifd struck a rock

  you old iron-bound scoundrel saiti
rawlins expressive of admiration

 this cheered peck up	

  you remember the divorce book rile
lent me rawlins yeah the old lad
tore it tip after she banged me around witli
it a while and throwed the pieces in thl
fire it didnt burn though not much o
it when she was gone i picked out sorror
of the importantest pieces of it i doubled
em up and put em in my pocket savin i
em to have somethin to read on more thai
 ever expected itd ever do me any goou
in court them leaves made a wad twe
inches thick  guess sleepin on em yotl
know and everythin pressed em tight i
darned lucky thing for you old fellers
but if your wife had been a few second
later you and id be gettin out of the boa

and give him back his job if it hadnt
been for riley lendin me that divorce
book whered i a been right now  shed
a been plantin toadstools on my grave
f peck went off to attend his sheep after
dinner his gun against his leg no more
troubled over having killed a man than if
he had been doing that sort of thing right
dong he seemed to take so much satis-
faction out of the event and enlarge him-
lf to such overspreading importance that
rawlins wondered whether he was in the
vay of becoming a killer as he had heard
of trifling anti insignificant men turning
ta



out in the old days he would do to
watch

  mrs peck drove in when the sun was
low bringing supplies she reported ev-
erything quiet at the fence nobody in
sight no interference with her passage
which she had been ready to contest with
any force her courage had mounted so
high but she wore a woried look in
spite of her days triumphs

  peck was still afield with the sheep as
mrs peck got down from the high seat of
the wagon her eyebrows pulled together in
a black knot she looked at rawlins who
had come to the door to greet her as it
she had something to say that concerned
him seemed to reconsider going about her
unloading silently

  ned what do you think she said
presently turning to him abruptly
ediths run off

  run off he repeated in amazement
his heart seeming to fall like a bucket in a
well what in the world would she want
to run off for

  you can search me unless its a man
i think maybe shes been writ in to one of
them mail-order fellers herself and hes
coaxed her to run off and meet him

  i dont think shed do a thing like that
she left early this morning elmer
come in he said a clemmons saw her
pass headin toward jasper she cant git
there before tomorrow afternoon-ill
have plenty of time to go over to albin
jacobsens in the morning and telephone
the sheriff to stop her i wanted to ask
you if you think i ought to or just let her
go her way

  let her go her way rawlins replied
resentful of ediths desertion if she
wants to ait out and leave us that way let
her go but why would she run away
she wouldnt have to do it would she 

  no shes her own man now i was
only her guardian till she was of age but
it looks mighty queer to me

  it certainly does look queer

  she didnt leave me no letter nor noth-
ing only that little note tellin me mr
peck was up here

  im pretty sure shes got something in
view we dont understand and i cant be-
lieve its a man rawlins said his genef-
osity rising up to the girls defense she 
probably be back in three or four days

  i dont know what to do-i dont want
to see her go wrong-but shes her own

man	 

  i dont believe id intertere in her
plans whatever they are he advised
short stories

shes running off with-if she s running
off thats her own business you couldnt
stop her if you wanted to if shes just
gone to jasper to get some pretty clothes
or a little hat or something shed resent
your interference dont you think

  mrs peck looked off across the valley
on the farther rim of which peck was be-
ginning to raise his voice in the evening
roundup of the sheep she drew a big
breath as of inspirational relief the per-
plexity of her brows relaxing calm settling
over her face

  ill ask mr peck about it she said

chapter xxiv

a fool and his gun

the seriousness of rawlins wound
made a daily trip to the doctor neces-
sary mrs peck liad gone back to
the ranch the same evening she came with
the wagon and the startling news of
ediths desertion leaving the two men to
hold what they had won pecks great in-
terest in the welfare of his sheep took him
abroad early and kept him away all day
except for a dash in at noon for dinner

  this threw rawlins on his own one-
armed resources very largely and he found
little that he could do he had not been
able to devise any scheme by which a one-
armed man could wash dishes for one
thing owing to that things had a dis-
tressing way of accumulating about the
place peck being content to scrape the
plates of the last meal for the next peck-
had not even thought to volunteer any help
in saddling graball for the daily trip to
lost cabin by using his teeth rawlins
had managed the cinch in a hazardous fash-
ion that held until he got to town where
the doctor tightened the girth to carry him
home

  several days passed that way with no
further interferenece by the forces which
had dominated that illegally occupied ter-
ritory so long while mrs peck had vis-
ited them daily news of edith was still
lacking the sheepwoman appeared to
have recovered from her first flurry but
rawlins was beginning to feel the strain of
anxiety he believed there was something
between mrs peck and edith which the
sheepwoman had concealed responsible for
the girls sudden desertion of the ranch

  a feeling of resentment toward edith
for her precipitate action her cold expres-
sion therein of complete aloofness from his
affairs and all interest in them had hard-
ened rawlins to her welfare for a while

now this feeling was clearing out of his
mind giving place to fear that edith had
not gone entirely of her own free will the
girl was not so heartless as to pull out like
that after the understanding that had
grown up between them she would have
come to him with her troubles he believed
unless she had been goaded beyond for-
bearance or driven away outright

  rawlins had returned from lost cabin
shortly before noon on the fifth day since
the fight a cloud of anxiety concerning
edith darkening the outlook even obscur-
ing everything beyond that hour

  he unsaddled graball and turned him
out to graze the horse having become so
entirely domesticated and affectionate that
he would come running at a called or whis-
tied summons and turned his one-handed
efforts to preparing the midday meal he
had brought potatoes and onions unusual
luxuries from town that trip with antici-
pation of an old-time kansas dish of the
two vegetables sliced and boiled togethefl
for supper that evening if he could get
peck to prepare the vegetables when he
came in for dinner the rest could be man-
aged with one hand

  rawlins was not quite certain that his
own gloomy state of mind was responsible
or whether peck had been sulky the past
two days he had appeared to be some-
what less communicative and voluble than
usual fancied or real pecks attitude had
not given much concern now when peck
came in for dinner there was no mistak-
ing his ill humor rawlins wondered if he
had stepped on the new flockmasters toes

  taters huh said peck taking a peep
into the sack its about time you was
chippin in somethin on the grub raw-
lins youve been eatin off of me ever
since the old lady brought up that grub

  all right peck rawlins returned
good-naturedly although he felt a desire
for a hot retort to the inhospitable charge
theres some onions in the sack too i 
thought maybe i could get you to clean
some of both of them for supper i could
manage to cook them all right

  it dont look like youve managed to
cook very much dinner peck said con-
temptuously i tell you right now raw-
lins im gittin tired of doin all the work
around this joint and youve got the gall
to ask me to clean onions on the side i
wouldnt clean the dang things for a dollar
apiece and i wouldnt eat em for five
you cant put all the dirty work off  me
around here i tell you rawlins

  im sorry old feller but youll have to
sheep

 take it as it comes rawlins said in
 friendly dispassionate way

   ive been doin it ever since i landed
 here peck sneered his glassy goggle eyes
 seeming to advance and recede in their
 shallow sockets as he leered at rawlins
 look at them dishes took at this messy
 joint it looks to me like youd clean
 things up rawlins you can afford to me
 iurnishin the grub

    the doors open peck if you dont like
 the kind of hospitality im able to offer
 rawlins said

   is zat so peck chattered you wait
 till i go then will you you aint got
 nothin on me because you killed a man

them coroner
fellers said the
one i killed was
twice as big as
yours you kind
of want to watch
your step when
you talk about
firin me out of
any door raw-
lins

 peck youre
 talkin like a fool rawlins said calmly

   he was not afraid of peck although his
 pistol was hanging  the wall behind the
 door where he had relieved himself of it
 on his return from town nor was it sur-
 prising to see this villainous streak of
 egotism and overbearing selfishness in the
 man rawlins had seen it growing from
 the day when pecks lucky shot knocked
 a man over in the fight but it had devel-
 oped faster than expected

   ive got as much right here as you
 have peck declared scowling and glow-
 ering as he slammed a slab of bacon down
 to haggle off some for the pan in his bun-
 gling way whered you a been at if i
 hadnt run them sheep of mine in here and
 stood them fellers off who done the
 fightin that time thats what  want to
 know ill bet you money if you found
 the bullet that went through that other fel-
 ler youd see it come out of my gun and
 that aint no dream

   youre welcome to all the glory peck
 you and tippie tried to git me shot up
  ycr there when i was green and didnt
 know the ropes you thought you was pul-
  hn somethin smart on a dude from st
 f joe you thought youd either git me killed
 off or run out of here  was green all
 right but i wasnt so green i couldnt see

 	yur game

   kawlins sat still keeping his mouth



shut but he was considering with grav-
ity that amounted to a great peril for peck
whether he ought not grab the hammer that
lay on a cross-studding and knock the slan-
tleious scoundrel cold his muscles were
setting for a quick reach and a quicker
blow when his more generous nature re-
strained him peck was not without justi-
fication in his rancorous recollection of that
plot against his safety and dignity there
was not much that he could say in self
defense

  you aint got nothing on me peck in-
sisted meanly this is as much my place
as yours you couldnt a held it down if
i hadnt been here to stand em off

  peck allowed the argument to rest there
concentrating his talents on frying the ba-
con which he always managed to put a
black border around with curled-up ends
almost raw he slashed and speared his
food vindictively all through the meal
looking up from his operations occasion-
ally with his round glassy eyes more bulg-
ing and expressionless than usual as if to
begin the one-sided quarrel again but he
evidently thought better or worse of it and
held his peace until he was through

  when peck pushed back everything
cleared up he seemed to be in a better
humor

  im goin to be square with you raw-
lins he said producing a wallet as sud-
denly as it was astonishing im goin to
pay you cash money for your shack and
so-called improvements  this place and
take your receipt for it then youre go-
in to hit the breeze

  rawlins was so amazed by this sudden
discovery of pecks hand that he sat across
the table from him staring he was un-
certain whether peck was trying to pull off
some kind of a joke of his own to even
past scores or whether he had some too
notion in his head for getting possession of
the homestead the choicest site for sheep
headquarters in that locality as the sheep-
men on the coroners jury had said

  what the devil are you drivin at
peck he asked at length as peck began
to put money down on the table beside a
folded piece of paper he had taken from
the greasy leather wallet that never could

have been his own

  up came pecks gun which he steadied
in his peculiar fashion with both hands
the left clasping the wrist of the right

  i mean youre goin to hit the breeze
out of here peck announced trying to
look mean succeeding fairly well
five hundred dollars and theies a 


short stories

sale for you to sign if you make a break
for a gun ill bust you wide open

  peck youre a bigger fool than i
thought you were rawlins told him ap-
parently without any deeper feeling than a
man would have in stating an obvious fact

  ill show you how big a fool i am if you
keep on talkin rawlins im just big
enough fool maybe to shoot you like i did
that other feller whos here to swear you
didnt pull your gun first

  well anyhow said rawlins appar-
ently undisturbed i decline your offer for
my improvements and possession of this
place it wouldnt do you any good even
if you could make your bluff go

  rawlins calm as he seemed was boiling
with inward rage he was picking up and
casting away the fugacious schemes which
came rushing into his mind for getting the
upper hand of peck the man was cun-
ning enough to know he had a long chance
in that none too particular community of
getting away with his plea

  youll have to pull your freight money
or no money you can take it or leave it
--thats up to you

  cupidity had made a tyrant out of a
fool thought rawlins as had happened be-
fore in history the best thing to do was
try to play him on a little while for an
opening and grab his chance when it
came

  ill send your things over to the hotel
at lost cabin in a day or two peck said
you can go and claim em or you can
leave em but if you ever show your face
around here agin ill bust you wide open
all right peck youre the boss right
now rawlins seemed to yield shove
that paper over here-ill sign it

  no you dont you dont git me to put
this old gun down till youre saddled up
and gone out of here come around here
and sign it and watch your step

  peck got up backing away from the
chair keeping his gun held on rawlins his
bony shoulders hunched up head to one
side one eye squinting along the barrel
rawlins pushed his chair away from tlie
table trying to assume a dejected and con-
quered mien he went slowly around the
end of the tabic where pecks old mexican
hat lay on the slab of bacon from which
their dinner had been cut the handle of
the butcher kmfe presented in a hopeful
invitation to rawlins eye as he passed un-
seen before that moment unthought of un-
til that breath

  rawlins snatched the knife and made a
lunge at peck who backed off trying to

cock his pistol a precaution which he had
overlooked one to which rawlins perhaps
owed his life rawlins jabbed the knife
against pecks ribs disconcerting his busi-
ness of raising the hammer-it was a sin-
gle-action old-time weapon-which slip- 
ped from under his thumb and came down
with a roar the bullet went somewhere 
rawlins was not concerned where just
then knowing it had not gone through him 
drop it he yelled making peck jump
with the threat of sudden death he put into
the command

  peck let it go there was a look of ter-
ror in his bulg-
ing eyes as he
lifted his long
arms and teg-
ged for his life
he backed off
his legs striking
the cot drawn
against the wall
bloodless agony
in his face

  dont kill
m e rawlinsn
peck begged i
wasnt goin to hurt you-it was only a
bluff

  yes im going to kill you rawlins
said savagely pushing the knife till it bit
youre not fit to live

  peck begged in broken ejaculations as i
rawlins faced him to the wall and stood 
him there with upraised hands then raw- 
lins dropped the knife and snatched his i
gun from the holster hanging in its accus-
tomed place behind the door

chapter xxv

the penitent

rawlins began to cool down in a
little while seeing the ridiculous-
ness of the situation peck was i
only a comedian take him at his worst

  peck im going to let you live-just 
now rawlins told him after holding him 
against the wall hands up between the low 
joists until he was stiff with fright but i
if i ever catch you with a gun on you
again anywhere anytime ill kill you on
sight take off that belt

  peck fumbled at it weak in the knees
trembling in every joint rawlins motioned
for him to throw it under the cot which 
he did and rawlins kicked it and the gun
back out of sight pecks eye was on the
greasy wallet and pile of greasy sheepland
money on the table
r

sheep limit

  rawlins he appealed turning in the
supplication of abject cowardice let me
take that money and hit it to hell out o
here before the old woman comes

  not on your life said rawlins get
the ctishpan

  peck moved limply about the order rol-
ling his unquiet eyes on rawlins gun
which followed him in every movement
not more than two feet from a vital part

  fill it up with onions rawlins com-
manded as peck stood with the pan a
dumb appeal in his glassy eyes

  for gods sake rawlins peck
pleaded i never could stand em-
theyll kill me

  youd just as well die one way as an-
other rawlins told him the gun inexora-
bly approaching his ribs

  peck filled the pan fishing the last onion
out of the sack and sat on the floor under
rawlins directions the receptacle between
his long legs where he went to work on
his bitter penance rawlins sat in the chair
that peck had occupied lately his gun close
to the back of pecks long neck

  ive got myself in a hell of a fix fol-
lerin that old womans lead said peck
his fright beginning to turn from cold to
hot he sweated as he worked and wept
his burning eyes on the door

  you have rawlins agreed coldly

  peck shook his head and wiped his eyes
on his sleeve

  let me go without the modey raw-
lins he begged let me git out of that
door and ill travel so fast itd take two
men to count me

  when youre through with that job
well talk about the next rawlins replied
and touched pecks sweating neck with the
gun

  ill give you them sheep-you can take
on-if youu let me git out of here
peck proposed

  if i took all your interest in them i
wouldnt even own a bleat rawlins said
youve done a lot of talkin about show-
in people where they get off peck youre
tretty dose to the edge right now yourself
get busy

  peck peeled along in the lacrimal vapor
that even his long back and neck could not
hoist his eyes above sniffling snorting
tears dropping on his dejected mustache
presently he began to talk trying to make
a case against his wife

  site was behind that dang fool move of
raine rawlins peck said information
which rawlins scarcely needed after see-
ing the wallet and greasy bills



  she said if id take my old gun and
bluff you out of here shed give me that
check-book she promised and i could go
the limit she was stuck on this place for
sheep she wanted it worse than she ever
wanted to marry a man in her life you
was a cripple she said you couldnt do
nothing with it and some sheepmend come
along here some day before long and boot
you off but i wasnt goin to hurt you
rawlins that gunplay of mine was all a
bluff

  i told you once that was a dangerous
thing to try inside of this fence peck

  i believe you rawlins but i wouldnt
a hurt you if youd a said you wasnt
goin to take that money and stood up for
your rights id a backed down thats
what i had it lined up to do i figgered
youd let me have that money if you didnt
want it

  rawlins said nothing only put the
creepy gun-barrel to pecks sunburned
neck

  peck worked on in desperate expedition
for a while keeping his mouthshut except
when he released a groan of agony or sigh
of hopelessness

  shes coinin up here this afternoon
peck said after a long silence by thun-
der i believe thats her now

  keep your seat rawlins said

  peck thought better of his attempt to
scramble up out of his disgraceful posture
the pan of onions between his thighs but
he looked round at rawlins with one last
plea in his red eyes

  let me tell her im just a peelin on-
ions for supper he begged put your
gun up rawlins and let me tell her that
if she knows you made me do it shell set
on me the rest of my life

  you were my guest rawlins re-
proached him and rou pulled your gun on
me and tried to rob me i believe youd a
killed me if youd got a chance at my back
go on with that job

  pecks imagination was at work through
his ears it wasnt his wife it wasnt any-
body at all he went on with his melan-
choly task working silently except for his
sniffling and snorting and peculiar little
squeaks of torture when he dropped the
knife now and then to drag the sleeve of
his jumper across his eyes he came to
the last onion in time his eyes swollen and
red

  rawlins he begged contritely let me
have one bill of money off of that pile ana
turn me loose ill leave this country so
fast itll singe my hair you can see how
itll be with me rawlins if that woman
comes here anti ketches me ill be sen-
tenced to jail all the rest of my life

  rawlins knew peck was right about that
for mrs pecks respect would vanish like
the plating on base jewelry the minute she
saw her husbands failure he was not
moved bv any pity at the prospect for
peck whatever he might get out of that
marital adventure in future would be no
more than he deserved but there was an-
other side of it to consider which pecks
proposal suggested

  that was the punishment and humila-
tion of mrs peck by aiding her disaffected
spouse to quit her in that cold and sum-
mary style that would hit her about as
hard as a divorce for the story would go
over the sheep country from the railroad
ou the north to the railroad on the south
and sheepmen and their red ladies would
laugh over it in greasy delight for mrs
peck was not a universal favorite rawlins
had learned lately her reputation was
bad in and around lost cabin where she
had the name of hard and tricky dealing
of hogging water and range to which she
had no right under the apportionment such
as other sheepmen respected

  there would be no sympathy for her on
the range the story
of her comical mail-
order husbands de-
sertion w o ii  d be
spread around with
chuckles and grins
about the surest
way for him to play
even with mrs peck was to speed her anx-
ious husband in his unfaithful design
peck went on with his argument as if he
had read rawlins thoughts and hoped to
bring him around

  if youll let me take a bill of that money
-just one bill i dont care how little it is
-ill hit it up so fast away from here ill
set the grass afire shell never ketch me
this time if youll let me go rawlins you
can t prove nothing on her youve only got
my word for it she was at the bottom of
this steal but if youll let tne hit it up for
st joe right now youll put a crimp in her
i on can take the rest of that dang money
and stick it in your jeans for damages and
tumble and hurt feelins and let me hop
out of here before she shows up shell
think i took it all

   and you  hop off somewhere and get
a gun and come back and shoot me in the
neck rawlins said with recriminatory bit-
terness youre so crooked i wouldnt

stories

trust you around the comer of the house

  if i ever pick up a gun again said
peck lifting his hand as if taking his oath
on it you can shoot me with a bootjack on
sight ive had enough of that dang gun i
wish to criminy i never saw it  tell you
rawlins im done with guns im
through

if  thoughtyou were tellin the truth
peck id let you go but how am  to

know 

  well i tell you rawlins you come
with me to lost cabin and hold that gun of
yours agin my ribs till you see me on the
stage hittin it up for the railroad if you
doubt my word i tell you im cured i
wouldnt no more touch another gun than
id pick up a redhot horseshoe give me
a bill off of that pile to pay mv way to the
railroad and ill ride the bumpers to st
joe you can keep the rest you can tell
her i took it all

   dont want any of it peck leave me
the wallet and this paper you had drawn up
for me to sign i can use them take the
rest and go

  peck jumped at the word as if he had
heard thunder he stiffened eagerly his
red eyes shining

  say you aint stringin me are you
rawlins he asked doubtfully

  take it and go-before i change my
mind

  peck grabbed the money and put it in
the side pocket of his notable bullet-proof
jumper snatched his big hat off the side of
bacon and broke for the door he stuck
his head out for a look around tooling it in
his peculiar way as if testing the wind be-
fore hoisting his sail then he set out one
foot cautiously with a long striding
movement

  the heel of the other foot was the last
sight rawlins had of anything belonging
to dowell peck which way he went or
how fast rawlins never knew when he
went out in a little while peck had disap-
peared as completely as if he had taken one
hop that was to land him in st joe

  rawlins was not troubled about the pos-
sibility of pecks vengeful return heeled
with that much money urged on by the de-
sire to be free of his matrimonial entan-
glement and back among the sartorial
charms of st joe peck would go right on
if he should miss the stage at lost cabin
he very likely would beat it to the railroad
rawlins believed and correctly as time
proved that the sheeplands would know
peck no more

rawlins picked up the unsigned bill of
sheep limit

sale and read it not having seen the con-
tents before it carried out what peck
had said for while the writing doubtless
was pecks with many capitals for com-
mon words many flourishes and some
short cuts in spelling there was a cunning
about the composition beyond the capacity
of that romantic cavalier it was the hand
of peck but the mind of his wife

 together with the greasy wallet now
empty to the leather rawlins put the bill
of sale in the drawer of the kitchen table
that served him for all purposes left the
pan of onions where it was but got pecks
pun and belt from under the cot and hung
them behind the door then he went out-
side to watch around for the next act in
that days eventful doings

  it was at least two hours after pecks
going the sun standing at midafternoon
when he saw mrs peck approaching from
the direction of the sheep which peck had
ranged out that morning some distance far-
ther up the creek than ever before she
stopped at the top of every slight rise as
e came along to search the valley in the
icinity of the sheep which were spread
ide she was looking for peck rawlins
knew very likely she had appointed to
meet him there to get the news of his suc-
cess being too crafty to compromise her-
self by appearing at the house before the
fbing was settled

i watching her wary progress toward the
liouse rawlins decided to conceal himself
in the buffalo wallow and see how she
would take it when she arrived he left
the door standing open the butcher knife
on the floor where he had dropped it the
n of onions beside the table as peck had
released it from the embrace of his ro-
antic legs but pecks pistol he belted
ound himself and his own rifle he took
n from the wall and hid

mrs peck rode up from the creek in
e same hesitant way every little while
stopped looking around anxiously
when she reached the house she hesitated
off a distance as if debating whether to
dismount or ride to the door finally she
e on slowly drew up in front of the
r some twenty or thirty feet away from
leaned and looked into the house then
dismounted leaving her horse standing
d went in

  she came out almost at once so quickly
at rawlins who had left his conceal-
ment to go to the house and have it out
with her had to dodge behind a bush for
it was not ready to be seen as long as she
piling up evidence of her guilt by her
	



baffled and anxious search of the premises
for signs of something that would accoun
tor the apparent desertion of the place
when she had disappeared around the
house rawlins went forward he met her
as she reappeared bursting around the
corner fairly panting with impatience

  oh there you are ned she said
startled turning as white as her tough
harsh skin could become without a long
bleaching ive been lookin all over for
you

  without expecting to find me he said
with such a cold hard manner as to cause
her to glance at him quickly feigning she
did not understand

  i thought id either find you or mr
peck around the place she said

  sure especially mr peck well
mr peck isnt here

  she was looking at the two guns swing-
ing on rawlins one of which she recog-
nized with a start that seemed to make her
eyes jump she read the suggestion of
what had happened to peck in the display
of his gun as rawlins had intended

  she stood looking at rawlins the blood
gone out of her face her mouth open with-
out a word to fill it she was a squat
broad coarse figure in her mans coat and
upturned overalls with greasy sombrero
pulled down on the back of her head to
the ears

  he did the best he could to put through

what you started
him out to do
madam raw-
lins said with
stern arraign-
ment but you
went too heavy
on a chance shot
that made a
weak bad man
out of a fool
peck was a crow
down in his giz-
zard he isnt here any longer

  she stood there swallowing dry lumps
gulping staring wetting her lips with her

tongue	 j-j

  you didnt-you didnt-kill him did

you ned

  he was too damned onery to kill
said rawlins vehemently but hes dead
to you from this day on

  mrs peck appeared entirely over-
whelmed whether by guilt remorse a
sense of her treachery rawlins could not
tell only that she was crushed smasneu
flat her boisterous assurance gone ner
short stories

loud authority silenced in her vulgar
mouth she did not attempt any denial
nor utter one weak word of defense she
was cauglit and convicted and she realized
it whatever her accomplishments in a
business way effrontery she had not
learned

  come in ive got something of yours i
want to give you rawlins ordered rather
than invited

  perhaps mrs peck thought it was the
money at any rate she did not hesitate
but entered as rawlins stepped aside at the
door to let her pass she stopped short a
little way within the door looking around
with renewed fear on the sight of dis-
order that had urged her out a few minutes
before in search of the answer she was
about to get the answer now and she was
afraid

  rawlins took the empty wallet from the
drawer handed it to her silently she
took it opened it turned it with hopeless
blankness a stricken sick look in her eyes
rawlins unfolded the paper with pecks
writing on it which if he had signed un-
der the threat of pecks gun would have
made him homeless displaying it at arms
length before her eyes

  you see it isnt signed he said and
folded it again and put it in his pocket
here he offered pushing the pan of
onions toward her with his foot take
these away with you if you want them-
theyre seasoned with pecks tears youll
never see him again he took the money
you gave him to force on me at the point
of his gun and left he was glad to go
 let him leave because he said and i be-
lieved him it would hurt you more to have
him desert you than to have him killed

  mrs peck turned to the door went out
stood a little while looking around as if she
expected to see pecks vanishing figure at
the top of the hills somewhere

  youre to blame she said sorrowfully
rather than vindictively you drove him
away

  no youre the one that did it he cor-
rected her hes been waiting for his
chance ever since you started lo make a
sheepman out of him and you know it

  somebody was coming in a wagon from
the direction of lost cabin along the old
trail that used to run across the creek at
that place in the days before galloways
fence was built the mark of the old road
was to be seen yet between rawlins stack-
yard and house and this wagon the sudden
sound of its clucking as it lurched over the
long-disused road startling their attention

was heading down that way it was mj
more than a quarter of a mile off wh
they saw it first two people on the seat 
led horse following behind

   mrs peck turned to rawlins with a lit
tie color in her face a little glint of vindic
live fire in her eyes

  thais edith and tipple she said
pie follered her to jasper the day she lefl
they run oil there and got married

  she said this with cruel malevolena
glad in this moment of her great humila
tion to put her tongue to somelhiug tlis
would give him pain

  give me an iuvellup and some paper-
want to leave her a note

   whatever the writing it was soon don
mrs peck handed the message to rawlin
requesting him to deliver it to edith wh
she arrived she was mounting to ride o
about her business when rawlins hurrit
to her the unsigned bill of sale in h
hand

   you may liave this-its no use to me
he said putting the paer in her han
nobody knows anything about it but y
and me and peck if you keep it und
your hat nobody will ever know

   mrs peck crumpled the paper and stxni
it in her pocket swung to the saddle wi
agility surprising for her weight and year
she looked down at rawlins with soici
thing unsaid in her open mouth and look i
at the wagon which was drawing nezi
some indication of emotion in her hard ft
tures which rawlins interpreted as sorroi
ful contrition she thrust her hand towajl
him suddenly without a word as if a skin
him to forget and forgive while making s
fare well

  rawlins let her hand hang there untrs
for a little while the hardness of fcj
wrong the resentment of her cunniij
treachery holding back all friendly conce
sion then his redundant generosity ror
and leveled everything he took bj
rough hand for a quick clasp and wav
her away secretiy wishing her better fci
tune with her next man although he kne
she deserved no more than she was suffei
ing that minute

to save the sheep

edith jumped out of the wagon j
soon as she drove into rawlin
yard and came running to him con
cern in her face breathless in her inquii
about his wound

the sheriff told me about it that ws
sheep limit

the first id heard of the fight you and
peck were in she explained i was down
at jasper- only got back today i passed
byhere this morning and knocked on your
joor but there wasnt anybody around
rawlins was not very successful in his
attempt at unreserved cordiality although
he greeted tippie warmly when he came
over in his deliberate fashion which nei-
ther mischance to other men nor good for-
tune to himself seemed sufficient to accel-
erate the wound was troublesome but
not serious rawlins told them the doc-
tor said he would be all right in six weeks
or two months it was unlucky to happen
to a man who had hay to cut but he had to
take the bad with the good

  yes it was aunt lila and she had left
a note rawlins produced it as he spoke
and delivered it glad of the diversion it

fiused thankful that the congratulations
e felt bound to offer in keeping with con-
vention although so contrary to his honest
desire could be staved off for a little while
let them spring it he told himself he
was not supposed to know anything about
their business although on the face of
appearances it was plain enough for any-
body to conclude

i thats funny said edith her face a
study in emotions as she stood looking at
the brief writing mrs peck had left
thats darned funny she amended a lit-
tle more forcefully passing the note on to
fippie

i um-m-m said tippie glum as glue
seeming to study the note not as funny
its some things ive read

  he handed it to rawlins who asked
  diths permission in a questioning glance
  ith flushed laughed queerly nodded
  rawlins read the hastily written line or
  o read again grinned a feeble knocked-
  out sort of grin looking from one to the
  other the writing ran 

 edith j give you them sheep for a zved-
ding present from your old aunt

lila duke

 wedding present said edith red as a

geranium well i like-

  sure said tippie weddin pres-
ent

i i con- rawlins began to be stopped
by edith with interdictory hand

  sh-h-h you might say something
he said a laugh in her eyes

 sure weddin present tippie re-

i m



peated the old lady thinks youre goin
to get married

  no she dont elmer edith corrected
him laughter growing in her bright happy
ey- thinks were married already
you and ned how in the thunder
could she think--

  no you and i

  she dont think youre that big a fool
tippie said sarcastically

  rawlins felt as if he had gone through
some dreaded initiation the relief of hav-
ing it over with and knowing that the
worst fears were unfounded gave him
such a feeling of lightness he could have
flapped his wings and crowed he saw
now how impossible it was tippie would

  have been the
  last m a n to
  think of such a
  thing good old
  tippie honest
  old tippie
  rawlins felt like
   embracing him

	thats what
v she think s
edith insisted and look how she signs
her name lila duke what do you think
she means by that edith appealed to
them with baffled eyes

  habit said tippie

  shes a widow again rawlins ex-
plained

  did they kill him tippie asked eag-
erly hopeful

  no hes run off again this time hell
make it stick

  shell be the feller to get the divorce
then said tippie thats what she means
by signin the old name she considers it
settled already

  edith seemed indecisive between laugh-
ter and tears the thought of peck per-
sisting in his efforts to get a free ieg once
more moved the deep appreciation of hu-
mor in her soul but reflection on her
aunts bitter humilation and misery checked

the outburst

  yes its off for good this time she
said aunt lila wont send the sheriff
after him any more poor old soul she
deserves it but im sorry for her just the

same	  

  how longs he been gone tippie in-
quired

  i dont know just when he left-he was
around here this morning rawlins said
vaguely determined that hditb never
should know of her aunts greedy plotting
to oust him from his homestead it it de-
short stories

peiitled on him to tell her of it

  i think id better go over there and
keep my eye on your sheep a while then
edith tippie proposed im afraid the
old lady might experience a change of
heart and drive em out of here

  tippie took the saddled horse hitched at
the tail of the wagon and rode off edith
and rawlins watching him go the silence
of embarrassment between tliem edith
was the first to recover

  site had her nerve to think id marry
elmer she said

  didnt she

  she knew all the time i was going to
jasper to file oil a homestead in here i
told her i was going to i asked her to tell
you

  file on a homestead edith you

dont tell me why she never-

  ive got the papers i can prove it
edith laughed thats mine joining you
on the east

  well  never thought id have you for
a neighbor he said his delight dampened
not a little by the thought that she never
intended to he anything more and she
never said a word

  we had a little fuss edith said

  i thought as much

  wed had plenty of them before about
my money you know she said id used
it all up in board and education and care
and that kind of stuff when ive worked
my way ever since ive been with her she
never was my legal guardian you know
ned she wasnt under bond or anything
father asked her to look after me when he
was dying he turned over his insurance
and all he had to her to keep for me

  so that was the way of it 

  there wasnt much we compromised
on fifteen hundred dollars she paid me
and i struck out for jasper to file on that
land while the filin was good

  you took a long chance im afraid
edith hewitt was here with the last
bunch that raided us when peck killed
one of them he isnt the kind of man to
let it drop even though weve got the sher-
itt behind us now ive been looking for
them every day

  edith heard him out with a queer look
of incredulity and surprise

  why is it possible you havent heard
the news ned sheep limits off youve
won your fight

  nobodys been around here to tell me
about it he replied a little sarcastically
as if to say if that was hernotion of a joke
he couldnt see it

  hut youve been over in town toiiajj
and thats all theyre talking about therej

she said

  i didnt see anybody but the doctor atu
he failed to mention it whats the l

news edith

  what  told you ned sheep limiti
off galloway was in town himself tii

morning trying to square it and explain 
tliis shootin-up his gangs been doing tt
you

  you dont tell me

  he was the sheriff told us about it
the sheepmen are already hittin the rwu
to jasper in droves to file ou land in her
the sheriff says therell be a hundred thou
sand sheep on this new range inside of i
week

  well i wish gallowayd done his talk
in a little sooner rawlins said hoa
does he explain it whats behind hi
change of heart

  the w ool growers association is be
hind it edith explained theyre gc
tin to be a power in politics in this corn
try and galloways uneasy about his j 
he says his lease is just about out on thi
land anyhow and he intended to take h
fence away hes been pass in out tja
word that the limits off tellin the sheef
men to go to it he says the shoot in h
men did trvin to drive you out wasn
authorized by him he sidesteps all r
sponsibility the sheriff says

  rawlins was not highly elated over th
news that galloway had declared shaft
limit off it seemed to him somehow thi
he had failed that galloway had fort
stalled his triumph and taken every man
of credit from his hand it would appeal
to the public that his fight had been ust
less untimely ill-advised if he ha
waited a little while the general impress
would be that he might have taken posse
sion in peace as the rest of them would tk
still there would be some who woul
understand galloways hand had bee
forced by his assertion of rights inside th
fence those sheepmen who had bees
there twice as a coroners jury knew th
effort to oust him had been a viciousl
earnest one it would be hard to ma
them lxlieve galloway had any intention o
giving up the land umil he saw this per
sistent homesteader was there to stay ant
his staying would be the rift in the feua
that would admit so many more that sena-
torial prerogative must give way before th
rush

  let the credit go where it might sheep
limit was off the big white spot like a des
r

sheep limit

erf in a geography map would be blank
and mysterious no more he had won
what he had put his foot inside the fence
to win and much sooner even though at
greater cost than he had expected

 its all right he said drawing a deep
breath but  wish galloway had begun
to talk a little sooner youve got your
homestead anyhow you were lucky to
get down ahead of the rush and i appreci-
ate your courage and-and your-nerve
much more than  can tell you are you
going on to the ranch 

  no its all off down there for me ive
got my tent and all i need in the wagon-
thats what i went on to lost cabin for
tliis morning i traded in my saddle-
horse to smith phogenphole on that team
and wagon

f it looks like a good team and i guess
the wagons all right you know more
about that sort of thing than i do edith
are you going to camp on your home-
stead 

i sure im here to stay and i sup-
pose- seriously face averted-ill have
to marry somebody now or lose the sheep
wo wedding no present thats the way
aunt lilall figure it

i i wish there wasnt a sheep in the
world he said with such bitterness it
fceemed he must have taken a sudden and
seep dislike for the wooly genus

i thats no kind of talk for a sheepman
file corrected him gently

  i couldnt ask you to marry me just to
  ve a band of dirty sheep he said ridic-
  ously as he realized when he saw her
  t her hand over her mouth to stifle a
  ugh i always intended to he drove
  ive planned toward it ever since i
  t saw you edith and now-darn it
  dith youd think i wanted to marry you
  st to save the sheep

  foolish  said edith facing round with
  encouraging grin it would be just
  same with me if there wasnt any sheep
  hat do you suppose i took up that home-
  d for

twhy pleadingly hopefully you
dnt take it up just because you wanted to
i my neighbor did you edith 

  i took it up because i had to do it while
  was single and i wanted that land in the
  mily

  edith earnestly firmly when elmer
  es back ill ask him to stay around here

  i we go over to town and-and-

  i get it over with she laughed no
fees not going to be any grand rush

tiie

   



about this thing ned im going to camp
over on my claim but im going to look
after you till your arm gets well itll be
all right-elmers going to be here with
us hes taken up the half-section on the
west of you

   the old rascal not to say a word to me
about it

  yes he s quit aunt lila hes going
to stock up with a fine breed of sheep and
go into it on a big scale i expect aunt
lilall sell out now shes talked of it a
good while

  tippie was coming back from his sur-
vey of the sheep evidently satisfied that
mrs peck was not hovering around them
in the indecision of a changing heart

  you re a hospitable and neighborly
man i must say edith pretended to ac-
cuse rawlins with the freedom of a lady
whose claims on a man have been adjusted

to her entire sat-
isfaction ive
seen the outside
of your house
from the hills a
hundred times
and now when
im up to it you
dont even invite
 me to look in-
side

   its all kicked
up and thrown around in there he tried
to justify himself ive been one-sided
for a week and peck wasnt much good
for housework you must excuse appear-
ances edith and not judge my habits by
what you see

  edith laughed at the disorder at the
crude housekeeping attempts and un-
washed dishes which were spread around
some of them even on rawlins cot but
it was the pan of peeled onions under the
table that caused her special merriment

  what on earth did you clean them all
at once for ned she wanted to know
or did you do it of course not with
one hand it must have been peck but
why  were you expecting company 
rawlins stood by grinning feeling him-
self cornered for a reasonable explanation
he wished he had put the pan under the
bed when he had come in for a minute
after mrs pecks departure to take off
pecks gun

   it was done  a little bet this morn-
ing between peck and me he said peck
bet me his gun he could clean all the onions
without shedding a tear and he lost

                    by j d newsom
           author of boots three days lcaze

 for countless miles of marching in sunny france private cooper
 had been nagged and jeered at by the bullying corporal walthon
 when a man was footsore ready to drop there would always come
 that snarling keep going but when they got into action among
 shells and machine-guns keep coinc came to mean something else

the battalion had been on the
move ever since dawn going
at a snails pace along congested
roads where an unending stream
of motor traffic raised clouds of
gray-white dust the air was full of gaso-
line fumes dust and profanity truck
drivers and ambulance drivers all of them
in a great hurry cursed the battalion and
the battalion its collective mouth full of
grit cursed back as best it could

  it was a baking hot cloudless day the
tall poplars lining the road offered no pro-
tection against the glaring sun and the
men crawled along sweating limping
blasphemously disgusted with the war
with france with themselves it was roll-
ing open country through which they were
marching on either side of the road there
were fields of yellow wheat aswim in the
dancing heat haze clumps of trees crowned
the low ridges closing the horizon

  most of the time the battalion was forced
to keep to the grassy bank by the road-
side dodging along between the trees and
the ditch  he bank was cut by drainage
gulleys so that the men walked for a few
yards and then had to jump across a ditch
this method of marching made them look
like merry school children out on a picnic
skipping and frisking out of sheer joy
but the things they said would have singed

the hair off the average school boys head
skipping ditches with a full pack on one
back full cartridge pouches a box res
pirator a ritie not to speak of entrench
ing tools bayonet and a steel helmet-skip
ping ditches when thus encumbered doe
not improve a battalions temper

  moreover they had lost their brigad
and the colonel was riding up and down th
line trying to inspire his men to stil
greater exertion when he was not dodginj
motor trucks something was happening
over the edge of the horizon somethin
great and portentous to the accompanimen
of heavy shelling which reached the march
ing men like an overtone to the rumblinj
wheels of the traffic

  wounded men limped by on the otha
side of the road and a flock of very dirtj
german prisoners stood alout with theii
hands in their pockets-to hold up theii
pants for all the buttons liad been cut ofi
to make their escape too foolish to be con-
templated

  the battalions officers and senior non-
coms were even more short-tempered than
their men not because they had strayed
far from the fold and knew not where ta
find it but because with every passing
kilometer they were losing men who could
not keep up with the procession

  a reinforcement draft of two hundred


keep going

  nd fifty men had joined up two days be-
ore their feet were soft their lungs were
weak their backs were broken and their

cgs were so much mush the old hands
he veterans of the argonne woods
tramped through the dusty grass without
too much trouble but the newcomers found
life very hard indeed and dumbly won-
dered what it was all about

corporals sergeants and some officers
ded them along but every so often a
sat down collapsed or rolled into the
itch and stayed there refusing to be
oved either by threats or appeals to his
r nature and his superiors had to
ve him there because the battalion went
er onward like time and tide waiting for
no man

  one man however try as he might
could not drop out and go peacefully to
sleep by the roadside he was a short
spare young man by the name of randolph
cooper whose head bobbed drunkenly 
his shoulders as he walked for he was very-
tired in addition to his other equipment
he was bent beneath the weight of an auto-
matic rifle he shambled along at a jog-
trot his knees giving way at each step
and he skipped no ditches he stepped
iown into each gully and climbed painfully
p the other side dust was caked on his
ce where sweat had grooved little chan-
ls giving his countenance a frightful ap-
arance which unfortunately did not ter-
fy corporal walthon

  walthon was large beefy and muscular
  here other men had to trot he strode
  ng taking long easy steps most of the
  e he was stepping on coopers heels
  iberately stepping on coopers heels
  e too was hot and sweaty and his prom-
  ent blue eyes were rimmed with eyelashes
  vy with clotted dust his tunic was
  hooked exposing his bull neck and his
  est which was indeed hairy

  he was not losing any men every few
  onds his large voice boomed lustily
  eep moving youse guys keep mov-
  first man drops out ill bat him one
  it the butt end of my rifle gwan
  eep moving theres a war on

but cooper was his pet aversion cooper
d joined with the last draft and was top
ntlemanly to suit walthon he didnt
jsat his beans off his knife and he didnt
gem to know how to swear moreover
 was very quiet and had a great respect
or walthons stripes when walthon
lied him names he smiled sadly that
lile got walthons goat in something less

in

than fifteen seconds flat so he loudly de-
clared

he gave cooper no peace or rest gwan
xjj pr broken blossom he boomed

 his ain t no time for any of your kid-
glove stuff keep moving snap into it

  cooper kept moving looking over his
shoulder from time to time with a despair-
ing look in his eyes the smile was quite
gone

  the battalion came to a hill which the
road climbed without a twist or a turn it
was ten oclock in the morning and grow-
ing hotter and hotter cooper got halfway
up and stopped leaning against a tree-
trunk his mouth hanging open gurgling
for air

  well what dvou think youre doing
barked walthon posing for your pic-
ture gwan git going

  but corporal pleaded cooper i
cant im worn out i swear i am cor-

              -gun

hop along now hop

cant i rest for a second ill catch
up

  over my dead body youll fail out
jeered walthon catching his victim by the
coat collar and pushing him along gwan
git going keep moving

this undignified treatment which
aroused the whole sections primitive sense
of humor made cooper very mad indeed
corporal he said between set teeth

if you step on my feet again-

  spit it out urged walthon whats
on your mind 

  i-why ill report you cooper said
wildly ive had all i can stand and if
you dont stop i swear ill report you

  aint he cute bellowed walthon
sergeant heres a guy wants to report
me

  sergeant gorton was too hot and pi eoc-
cupied to argue whats trouble he in-
quired	

  this bird cooper claims i been climb-
ing up his heels walthon answered bois-
terously hes been trying to fall out all
morning

  walk on em some more urged lor-
ton damn it if any more men drop be-
hind we wont muster a full company by
the time we get where were going

  where is it ve are going sergeant
called out a little east-side new yorker
by the name of goldringer ve going to

the war this time		

you know as much as i do grunted
 

gorton  fust keep going

  yvalthon winked at cooper and jeered
there yare old kid im reported what
dyou know about that  gwan he added
savagely as ceoper stumbled keep go-
ing or   walk all over you

  oy  laughed goldringer vat a life
vat a life eh cooper aint ve got fun

  there was murder in coopers eyes as
the whole section shouted loud inquiries af-
ter the health of its poor broken blossom
his good manners seemed to be deserting
him rapidly

   you think youre damn funny he
snapped at walthon well i guess you
are but im going to get you far this and
get you good and plenty

  walthon looked at him curiously won-
dering whether the worm really was about
to turn but he dismissed the incident
with a grunt

  all right kid he agreed but you
better save your breath just now-and keep
going cmon snap into it

  they tramped on up hill and down dale
over roads blocked by traffic and lanes that
were deserted save for stragglers and
wounded men and as they drew nearer to
the sound of the guns they came upon dead
men and dead horses lying stiffly by the
roadside

  they passed through a village wrecked
burned out and smoking and went on up a
long slope into a belt of trees where the
dead lay thick in the wood they found
the rest of the brigade all snarled up wirh
horse transport and trucks and artillery
limbers as they passed close to a ravine a
howitzer battery opened fire with a roar
cooper who was not used to the sound of
guns going off at close range leaped side-
ways dropped the automatic rifle on one
mans toes and collided with another before
he could be stopped

  dear dear exclaimed walthon catch-
ing him by the belt and dragging him back
into place aint we the nervous one
gwan you saphead pick up that gun and
git going

  t he whole section said rude things about
cooper s morale and he hobbled along af-
ter that one spasm without paying any at-
tention either to his mates abuse or to the
roar of the howitzers but he thought a

  the wood was full of guns tucked away
in odd corners and all of them came into
action at the same time so that the noise
became deafening and the vibration shook
the leaves off the trees

  at last after long delays while guides

short stories

lost their way in the green-lit depths 
the wood the battalion rcached its a

pointed poitit
on the eastes

fringe of t v
wood bey on
the land f i
away toward
blazing villqj
which waft st
rounded x
broad fields 
wheat a uf
lined road pai
 ed close to t
village cutd
diagonally across die battalions front a
a line of telegraph poles marked tlie tra
of a railway hidden in a cutting whi
crossed tlie highroad at right angles son
where within the triangle formed by i
wood the road and tlie railway there wij
germans many of them two attacks
seemed liad failed to dislodge the eneii
who was hanging on desperately to j
railroad cutting and tlie wreckage of i
village

  peering through the underbrush coon
could sec the black vomit cast up by i
heav- shells that were battering the iii
and the white and black smoke puffs 
shrapnel making strange patterns agais
the sky

  at that distance however it did ij
seem very terrible even though the soic
of the bombardment rolled back like cea
lessthundcr by degrees his eyes adapt
themselves to the distance and he real i 
dimly what was happening over by i
highway a strong thick tree was all at oii
torn in two and flung away when j
smoke of the explosion cleared nothil
hot a splintered stump remained ar -
roofed bam on the outskirts of the villi 
crumbled in a great shroud of pink d i
and bright yellow smoke the wrecks j
caught fire

  away off to the left several lines of rrl
were moving through the wheat cooj
saw the shrapnel puffs appear in the sj
above them the lines seemed to be bloi
to pieces the wheat was full of shadoi
troughs here and there men still movl
forward machine-guns clattered angri
no more men were moving through t
wheat and the guns closed down agai
hunting out the machine-guns

  horror-struck cooper stared at t
leaping fountains of earth and smoi
watching for those midgets to reappear

  veil vat you looking at inquin


keep going

 gowrmger lying close beside him in the
 underbrush seen a ghost or some-
 thing

  did yon see what happened over
 there choked cooper they were
 blown to bits to bloody bits

   aw thats all the bunk declared wal-
 thon whose face was pasty white for he
 bad been watching the attack also
 theyre lying down waiting for the guns
 to finish the job quit belly-aching you
  poor matt youre enough to give the whole
 regiment conniption fits pipe down for
 gods sake pipe down

   other men with the same savage empha-
i sis urged cooper to shut up and lie still
 they needed no reminder of the job that
 lay ahead of them but cooper could not
lie still here he was face to face with
something new and frightful it scared
him half to death while the other half of
him wanted comfort and sympathy he
certainly got neither from that gang along
the fringe of the wood too many men were
getting ready to answer their makers call
and none of them had any pity to spare

   cooper buried his head in his arms and
 wept salt tears of misery and disgust he
 was tired beyond the limit of endurance he
 was hungry he was hot ants were crawling
 down the back of his coat collar and he
 didnt care if it snowed ink

   oy cackled goldringer finding this
 display of emotion highly contagious
 must ve all be killed by those great shells 
 vat a vaste of life it is ve vas told the
 germans vas running avay look at em
 running away for god look at them then
 ve are losing the war

   walthon who had no nerves caught
 cooper by the shoulder and jerked him to
  is feet

     you lousy bum he snarled youre
 a soldier now and if you dont quit boohoo-
 ng ill lay you over my knee so help me
   and pound the life outen youse
 -mmon my fragrant blossom smarten up a
 bit

   he gave cooper a friendly kick for the
 cgood of his soul and that last indignity put
 tfresh courage into cooper

  ill get you for that he said savagely
 you big stiff you cant get away with that
 rt of thing dyou hear im going to
 get you good and plenty

  walthon noting the look of fury in his
 i victims eyes nodded his approval

   i hats dandy he declared just hold
   until we get in among the krauts and
   oull be jake youre coming on kid
   re coming along



  t hen the germans turned their guns
onto the wood hunting for concealed bat-
teries and for the next half hour the bat-
talion suffered most terribly men were
crushed and buried beneath falling tree-
trunks and whole platoons were blown to
pieces and scattered among the hign
branches it lasted no more than thirty
minutes but they were eighteen hundred
seconds of living hell while the air was
full of screaming things and the ground
opened up and belched hot gases upon the
men sweating inside their masks they
lay close to the ground with nothing to do
but wait wait wait for the rush of the
shell that would bring death to them

  at last the guns switched off concen-
trating on the batteries farther back in the
wood and the battalion came out of its
trance it was late afternoon the sun
was slowly going down into a haze of pur-
ple dust and the trees were full of thick-
ening shadows down below in the golden
plain the fight still raged neither side gain-
ing or losing thick clouds of smoke
hung above the smashed village casting a
long weird shadow upon the wheat

  then came the order to move out of the
wood

  sergeant gorton gave orders in a clear
voice which rang among the trees you

see  viase

pine   

       left of
that theres a
road and a level
crossing got
that  right
oar foll-cs are
held up just this
 side of the vil-
 lage and theyre
getting cut to
hell by machine-
guns in the railway cutting you cant see
the cutting bnt its there right enough
were going to clean it up before nightfall
and hold it sos everythingll be jake for
tomorrows show the next division is
away forward on the right waiting for us
get that were holding up the works

  another regiment was already moving
forward bearing off toward the highway
where the wink-wink-wink of rifle and ma-
chine-gun fire was plainly visible in the
fading light cooper found himself mov-
ing also gripping his liayonetted rule so
hard that his fingers grew cold and numb
the wheat was full of concealed shell
holes dead men were everywhere under-
foot so that the battalion tnpped and stum
bled through all kinds oi half seen horrors
short stories

and the officers were busy keeping the long
line steady as if it were on parade instead
of marching to its many deaths across a
cliarnel house

  cooper kept one eye on walthon firmly
resolved to carry out his threat but he no-
ticed with cooling ardor that walthon was
watching him also soon he had other
things to think about for stray bullets
were beginning to whine past his head
here and there almost unnoticed in the
breast-high wheat men were beginning to
drop and the battalion left in its wake a
dreadful trail of broken men whose voices
cried out for a little while and then were
lost in the growing din

  the long line pressed on tramping
tramping tramping through the rich ripe
wheat where there were already so many
dead they went down into a shallow fold
in the ground and there the german shrap-
nel caught them like the steady hiss of
hail on water the bullets beat down upon
the crops the battalion went on at a jog-
trot moving quickly out of that whistling
inferno up on the crest of the ridge lay
the advance posts-the survivors of other
attacking waves who had reached that high
point and could go no farther they were
strange powder-blackened creatures un-
lovely to behold but they raised a weary
cheer as the battalion swung on its way
erect unblinking grimly splendid and
heartbreakingly proud as they paraded past
the shell holes where the outposts lay

  the long twilight was ending and the
sun was a disk of copper gleaming behind
violet and saffron streamers but it was
light enough yet for men to see the dark
mass of the village and their objective to
the left of it marked bv the tops of tele-
graph poles standing out black and gaunt
against the sky

  then all along the front dropped the
creeping barrage timed to the second a liv-
ing leaping flashing wall of steel and
earth deafening and overwhelming it
seemed to blow the earth itself out of be-
ing to pulverize and scatter it and turn it
upside-down

  keep up with it keep close yelled
gorton youre bearing off too much to
the left-

  cooper swayed away shielding his face
with his arm as he heard the rising shriek
of an onrusliing shell it struck the
ground at gortons feet the blast of the
explosion flung cooper to te ground gor-
ton was gone blotted out  lumps of
earth fragments of hot metal rained down
on coopers back and legs he lay still

wrenched by an uncontrollable fit of nau-
sea for he had seen his first man most
hideously killed he shut his eyes to try
to keep out the picture an arm suddenly
detached sailing through the air and gor-
tons head-

  up wit you me broken blossom

  it was walthons raucous voice braying
in his ear and walthons gun butt was
hammering against the small of his back

  cmon git going theres nothing
wrong wit you git up keep going

  his words were blown away by the hur-
ricane of sound for the german counter-
barrage had come down and the craziest
nightmare conjured up by the craziest brain
was as nothing compared to the immensity
of that flashing clamor

  into it into the twilight of smoke and
noise went the battalion the colonel was
down and the senior captain was gone
and companies were commanded by ser-
geants and not a german yet had been
sighted in small groups the survivors
drifted along like phantoms stumbling
through a red-shot darkness full of wild
shrieks dust and the spreading black
spouts of bursting shells

  cooper went on because to go back was
senseless sometimes there were men be-
side him and sometimes he went on all
alone dead men lav everywhere curled
up in shell holes flat on their backs staring
up slack-jawed at the flaming summer
sky caught in grotesque poses

  walthon loomed out of the flying dust
he trudged along beside cooper head bent
down on his short neck seemingly preoc-
cupied by the important business of step-
ping carefully over the dead his long
strides carried him past cooper he half i
turned with a quick threatening gesture
keep going he yelled cmon
goings fast as i can cooper shouted
back angrily

  git on faster ordered walthon he
grabbed at coopers shoulder and tried to
drag him along for companys sake but
cooier tripped and went sprawling into a
shell hole where there was a puddle of cold
blood

  he started to scramble out sickened by
the sight of the soft thingsspattered in that
hole but he flattened out again as a slither-
ing shriek rising clear above the uproar
warned him of onrushing doom the shell
burst a few yards ahead one great hunk
of steel ripped the pack off his back and the
dark sky rained dirt clods upon him

  he struggled to his feet and went on
in a daze he tripped upon something that
keep going

  lay in front of him the something was
  corporal walthon half buried bv the ex-
  plosion but unhurt coopers boot caught
  him full in the face

   walthon bellowed yon mutt you
 done it a-purpose just as you said you
 would ill skin ye alive you been lay-
 ing for me ye lousy skunk 

    youre a liar yelled cooper i didnt
  do it on purpose i didnt even see you
  hurt

    you did do it a-purpose brayed wal-
 thon dig me out you hunk of tripe
 dig im caught all down one side

    all right ill dig you out cooper re-
  torted savagely carried away by the bril-
  liancy of the thought which had just flashed
  through his mind but by god  take
  one real kick at you first you got it
  coming your way

    and clumsily he aimed a kick at a por-
 tion of walthons anatomy rising slightly
 higher than the rest of him then he dug
 while the corporal raved and swore he
 would kill him and squirmed his way out
 of the heavy shroud

    all at once the inevitable consequences
  of his rashness dawned upon cooper he
  had deliberately struck a non-com on the
  held of battle appalled by what he had
  done all his fine courage oozing out of
  him he took to his heels glancing back
  over his shoulder he saw the dark bulk that
  was walthon come lumbering after him

    abruptly he passed out of the heart of
 the barrage it was almost dark all color
 had drained out of the sky and the plain
 was dull gray ahead the trees lining the
 highway were black fingers raised against
 tlie sky

   he was all alone in the wheat going
 straight toward the german line ap-
 parently the attack had fizzled out he
 decided to lie down and waitfor orders but
 he caught sight of walthon hurrying along
 close behind him he was much more
 afraid now of walthon than he was of a

i whole army corps of germans he
bounded ahead diving into the wheat he

	was startled to the verge of nervous pros-
t tration to find himself lying next to little
h- goldringer

for god where is everybody chat-
 tered the east-sider what a terrible
business this is not another step vill i
it make till i am given orders it aint sen-
 sible

   we got to reach the embankment
 snapped cooper goaded on by fear of the
c corporal come on buddy lets get
there i dont see any germans i guess

us

our barrage did the trick

  but other men had struggled through the
curtain of fire and were moving forward

a machine-g u n
began to clatter
another joined in
and yet another
a stream of bul-
lets sang above
cooper and
goldringer a s
they hugged the
ground wheat
stalks cut by the terrible reapers fell upon
their backs

  i guess we might as well quit- be-
gan cooper

  ihen he felt a hand close on his ankle
he wrenched himself away and crawled
on exhibiting an astonishing turn of speed
on his hands and knees goldringer stayed
close beside him

  veil vy dont you quit gasped the
east-sider this is craziness or did you
want the medal of congress or some-
thing

  medals hell cooper said simply
keep going you poor simp or well both
get killed

  they came to a broad lane in the wheat
at the end of the lane there was a machine-
gun they could see tlie spurt of flame
winking in the growing darkness and they
flattened out as the bullets whipped by less
than a foot above their heads the artil-
lery fire was dying down though shrapnel
was still being sprayed over the german
positions at the intersection of the highway
and the railroad cutting

  enough whispered goldringer this
is a great foolishness i am telling you

suppose ve find a good deep hole-

  but the wheat crackled and swayed closc
behind them and cooper shied like a skit-
tish colt	t
keep moving he rasped were
nearly there they cant see us its al-
most dark come on dont be scared im
with you

   they had lost all contact with their com-
pany with their battalion and it seemed to
them that they alone were lying up close
to the german line with set teeth and eyes
bulging out of their heads they crawled
along on their bellies gaining a foot a yard
at a time levering themselves forward on
their elbows

  rifle fire and the sharp crack ot hand
grenades broke out over on their left it
was quite dark and the flash of the exp o-
sions made bright splashes of light -look-


short stories

ing behind him cooper saw walthon on
his knees in the wheat peering cautiously
from side to side there was a look of
cold fury on the corporals face which sent
cooper floundering along as if devils were

behind him

  the whole sector was alive with little

fights which ilared up died away and flared

up again to the tune of banging rifles and
the rap-rap-rap of machine-guns mares
soared tip along the line of elm trees where
the heavy smoke of bursting shells billowed
like low hanging clouds apparently the
attack liad failed to reach its objective the
shallow railway cutting and had turned
off too much to the left

  side by side cooper and goldringer
crawled on among the shell holes keeping
well away from that broad lane in the
wheat until abruptly they were confronted
by a rusty iron fence almost on top of
them a machine-gun opened fire crashing
and spitting for a full half minute and
in that half minute they worked their way
beneath the wire and fell in on top of the
gun-crew they killed them fighting like
wild men with all the pent up misery and
terror they had experienced to give them
fresh strength

  when it was over they were purged of
their terror for they had battled against
great odds and won the dead lay be-
neath their feet three shadowy corpses
tumbled in the bottom of the dark black
hole fear of walthon was blotted out of
coopers mind instead he felt immensely
elated he slapped goldringer on the
back and exclaimed weve done it
buddy we got here after all

  aw say it mit flowers urged gold-
ringer in a sibilant whisper we aint
safe yet this place is crawling mit
heinies

  and to hell with walthon added
cooper pursuing his own train of thought
ill break his neck if ever i see him again

   keep quiet snarled goldringer full
of heinies here i am telling you

  the cutting seemed to be lightly held
for they were left alone for a long while
and had lime to remember how tired and
thirsty they were before anyone disturbed
them somewhere along the way cooper
had lost his automatic rifle but they found
three lugers on the dead men and to keep
awake they tried to experiment with the
german machine-gun it jarred off with
a rattle almost kicking the grips out of
coopers hands

  working quickly they swung the gun
around on its tripod so that it commanded

the railroad embankment and the cutting
then they sat down to wait for what might
befall the feeling of elation gradually
wore off and they were so weary that they
would fall asleep for short terrible sec-
onds awaking with a convulsive start as
their jaded bodies sagged down and down

  the night dragged along the stars
were beginning to pale when a german
suddenly appeared on the brink of the hole
he gave a grunt of dismay when gold-
ringer cried hit him once cooper it
is a heinie

  there was a revolver in the germans
hand he drew back and fired twice both
bullets thudded into goldringers shoul-
der cooper brought the man down with a
single shot through the throat he top-
pled sideways down the embankment it
was all over in a flash but goldringer was
dying and several men were running along
the cutting toward the fallen german

   get the gun going choked goldringer
i feed it yet

   so instead of lying quietly in the post
where they might have escaped detection
for a while longer they brought the ma-
chine-gun to bear on the men in the cutting

and opened
fire it was
rank bad shoot-
ing but some
of the bullets
struck home
and the group
dispersed up
and down the
e m b a n k -
ment the fight flared up taken off their
guard the germans fired wildly- a party
advanced boldly along the wire fence on
the embankment and cooper blew them
off their feet after that no more men
tried to reach the post in so bold and dircet
a fashion

   coopers wrists were almost broken but
he kept the gun going cursing himself
whenever the jerking weapon almost leaped
out of his hands beside him goldringer
was dving lying propped up against the
side of the hole his head thrown back
blood trickling out of his mouth

   the light was growing fast the east was
striped with silver hugging the edge of
the cutting running fast a compact group
of germans bore down upon the captured
post wearily cooper trained the gun
upon them he no longer cared what hap-
pened if only he could sleep for just a little
while the gun clattered deafeningly a
few germans fell the rest pressed on one

                                                              
keep going



man flung a grenade it burst just short
of the pit and lashed coopers face with
gravel

  he pressed hard against the thumb
pieces but the gun was silent the belt
was empty he tugged at the luger in
his pocket

  someone leaped into the hole almost on
top of him

  keep going kid  hold it

  it was walthon with the automatic rifle
pressed close to his shoulder the ger-
mans went down in a straggling heap
strung out along the side of the cutting

  great stuff buddy  croaked walthon
i been hunting for you all night howre
you tooting

  not so bad answered cooper grin-
ning through the blood streaming down his
face you see-i kept going after i left
you

  ill say you did agreed walthon
god how you can sprint

  yep and i sprinted myself into this
mess by keeping going i guess were just
about through

  thats about right still we kept go-
ing and got here by heck shake kid
youre jake

  half a dozen machine-guns sprayed the
pit with lead forcing them down while up
the cutting came a fresh party of germans

  lets give em hell shouted cooper
suddenly bossing his corporal we got
to pass out sometime

  but before they could move the combined
american and french barrage struck all
along the line and they lay in the bottom of
the hole while howitzer shells and then
s transformed the cutting into a seeth-
ing caldron of smoke and wailing death

  the sides of the pit caved in they
crawled out into another shell hole taking
the automatic rifle with themn eventually
after long hours it seemed  the hurricane
moved on and their deafened ears caught
the sound of machine-guns they saw

coal-scuttle helmets bobbing up mechan-
ically they brought the automatic rifle to
bear and emptied it all along the crest of
the embankment

   a dozen men appeared marching stead-
ily through the gray dust-fog just as they
had marched the day before-their own
people lying side by side they watched
them go forward tumbling down the em-
bankment and up the other side more
doughboys and yet more went by some
of them waved to the two scarecrows and
jerked their thumbs over their shoulders
one man called out gwan back you
two this aint your show

   i guess hes right at that agreed wal-
 thon how about it kid had enough
 ill say i have cried cooper

   fine listen buddy help me up i
got a lump of lead in my leg somewhere
feels kind of numb

   they helped each other to their feet and
 went forlornly back across the broken land
 hobbling through the lines of advancing
 men unknown and unsung-the first
 yanks to reach that cutting and to stay
 there

   walthon was sagging at the knees so
badly that cooper had to half carry half
drag him along- until they stumbled upon
a party of stretcher-bearers hunting
through the much trampled wheat for
wounded men

   i can walk o k cooper said roughly
 but you better give this corporal a ride
 hes all in 	

   youre dead right i am whispered
walthon say kid you kep going line

   cooper said nothing tmtil walthon lay
 full length on a stretcher then he looked

 down scowling

   poor broken blossom  he muttered
thickly poor broken hell i can keep
going ten times longer than any  t-iee

 	thenhe pitched forward into th wheat
 and had to be carried back also

a jolt for hell and high water

carl jensen logging oper-
ator waylaid captain mackaye
as he was about to return to the
okisollos bridge b jiminy
skipper she ban pretty thick
he exclaimed funny thing this time of
year

  nothings funny about the weather on
this coast captain mackaye growled

  lie leaned over the rail staring ahead
what would you do now if you were
aboard that yacht you are always talking
of jjuying he asked at last

  b jiminy i never worry jensen an-
swered i hire a skipper to worry for
me

  captain mackaye had often amused him-
self with the lumbermans yachting ambi-
tions but just now the fog was thick and
getting thicker and like all mariners the
skipper hated fog his present run up the
british columbia coast from vancouver
was particularly difficult with strong tidal
currents narrow channels and landing

  floats in out of the way coves and arms of
  the sea

    he was about to return to the bridge
  when following the hoarse roar of the
  okisollos whistle he heard the shrill air
  signal of a small craft directly ahead cap-
  tain mackaye stiffened at the rail and
  stared into the gray curtain

     the okisollos whistle roared again and
  then out of the fog on the port bow came a
  dim shape that quickly took form as a small
  motor yacht

     especially from the height of the steam-
  ers deck she created an impression of
  doughtiness except for a pilot-house
  and trunk cabin aft her decks were clean
  and flush yet in line she was unmistak-
  ably a yacht and her bright work was rub-
  bed her brass shining the royal ensign
  floated from the signal mast and the stars
  and stripes at the stern

    a laughing boyish face was thrust out
  of a pilot-house window and there came a
  piping friendly note from the whistle
  the mate on the bridge answered and then
  the yachts skipper spied captain mackaye
  and shouted a greeting
  n	jo
his own logs

  b jimmy jensen began admiringly
as the white craft melted into the fog
astern

  wait mackaye commanded as he lis-
tened intently i thought so you dont
often see one without the other

  there was another shrill whistle ahead
a cocky assertive and wholly fearless blast
and then out of the fog slightly on the
starboard bow came a gray blur captain
mackaye and jensen hurried across the
deck and leaned over the other rail

  at first glimpse it appeared to be a work
or fish boat with black hull gray pilot-
house full bows broad beam and wide
stern but the last third of her fifty feet
showed a trunk cabin and like the white
yacht she flew the royal ensign on her sig-
nal mast and tlie stars and stripes astern

  an old man stood in the pilot-house door
and the head of another patriarch was
thrust out a pilot-house window they
waved casually to captain mackaye stared
critically at the okisollo and then their
craft slipped astern and was lost in the
fog

  you on a yacht captain mackaye ex-
claimed scornfully that old fellow
standing in the pilothouse door he could
buy you and your lumber camp a hundred
times and never miss the money but you
dont see any white pants and gold lace on
him or any tea table on his after deck
who is he asked jensen a trifle
taken aback by the skippers vehemence

  jack mead of seattle he and his
son jerry are the mead lumber company
hell and high water jack they used to
call the old fellow and still do and the
lad in the viking that we passed first is
the old mans grandson j j ive sighted
em many a time most always in convoy
all sorts of weather theyre what i call
yachtsmen

  b jiminy i have me a yacht yet carl
jensen exclaimed enviously

  and a skipper and a regular crew eh 
you bet you and a steward every
day he ban going to wear clean white suit
me i never touch a thing on the yacht
there were men aboard the okisollo
loggers on their way to camps up the
coast with whom jensen once had worked
but he had put those days behind him
never forgot that now he was au operator
that he owned donkey engines and camp
equipment that he possessed quite a bit of
real estate in seattle-in his wifes name-
and that he must talk only in a large way
and of large things must associate only
with men of affairs
in

  even with steamship captains there was
a certain amount of condescension though
it was mingled with a shrewd desire to
maintain pleasant relations with a man who
might some snow winter night pass up
the jensen camp and thereby cause bitter
complaints among loggers deprived of their
weekly consignment of fresh california
fruits and vegetables

  with captain mackaye he was particu-
larly affable for it happened that the okis-
ollo had the loughborough inlet run and
made weekly stops at the jensen camp in
cordero channel and it never occurred
to jensen that the skipper might be amused
by his yachting ambitions

  and those white pants and blue coat and
a cap and all the ribbons and gold braid
youll have them too the captain asked

  and a tea table on the back end like i
seen em do was the complacent answer
and when i get me a yacht i wont travel
on your old steamers any more b jiminy
i ban going go forth and back to my camp
when i ban ready and good

  perhaps the fog had gotten on the cap-
tains nerves and perhaps the loggers gold
lace ideas rasped the old seaman that
lad we passed in the viking young mead
he exclaimed hotly hes one of the few
yachtsmen that deserve a boat he could
have a diesel yacht as big as the okisollo
and carry a crew of twenty but he goes
out alone in that sixty-footer except for
an old chinaman to cook his meals and
keep things clean and nothing holds him
in either ive passed him when the gulf
of georgia was standing on her ear  ou
youd better set your tea table on a float

  b jiminy i have me a yacht yet
jensen persisted  but captain mackaye bad
already climbed the steps to the bridge

  astern of the okisollo driving on
j through the fog across the mouth of
 howe sound her huge motor turn-
ing over an even three hundred revolutions
per minute the viking held as true a com-
pass course as is possible for a small craft
in a ground swell

  john jeremiah mead her skipper listen-
ing intently for the fog signals of other
vessels his eyes always ahead or on the
compass swayed easily at the wheel there
was a trace of a smile about his mouth and
his eyes were alight fog might disturb
the master of a passenger or cargo boat
for him it furnished a game

  sing john his chinese cook came for-
ward from the after companionway ana

stood shivering at his side he looked out
r	short stories

the windows then studied the chart

  this too damn thick he exclaimed at
last you bet tel go in gibson landing

  j j grinned picked up a pencil wrote
some figures its ten seventeen he said
ill bet you that at eleven twenty-three the
point atkinson foghorn is fair abeam
the chinamans love of gambling
showed in his dark little eyes and then he
looked suspiciously at his employer you
go chaseum self he retorted you
catchum echo some island

  then ill bet you were tied up at the
yacht club at twelve-thirty

  you readum tide in nallows you
atlura time wana bet sule ting he shuf-
fled away down the wet deck leaving j j
to handle his yacht alone

  the viking made good her time and
course at point atkinson and a half hour
later was in the thick traffic and heavy cur-
rents of first narrows but once inside
vancouver harbor j j found the sun was
burning up the fog he had no difficulty in
the dredged channel to the royal van-
couver yacht club

  there a number of owners and a few
paid hands on the larger craft paused in
their work to watch him slip into a visitors
berth perhaps some hoped for a miscal-
culation a bungle but most of them knew
and liked j j and had only admiration for
the manner in which he handled his yacht

  sixty feet is a bit larger than a one-man
boat and the yachtsman who cruises alone

in one and
does so success-
fully has the
respect of his
fellows now
j j worked
his way in as
smoothly and
as surely as if
he had been
handling a
small launch
his lines were laid out his fenders ready
and the moment the viking lay alongside
the float he was overboard in thirty sec-
onds she was fast fore and aft the fenders
dropped and in twtenty seconds more a
sprns line held her tightly

  j j sprang aboard and into the engine-
room where he released the compression
threw the ignition switch and closed the
gas line a quick wash and change to
yachting uniform and he was on deck
again

  you could fire half your crew and still

get along j j called the owner of a

converted sulxrhaser and there was envy

in his voice thick outside

  never saw a thing from welcome pass
to the narrows come aboard you fel-
lows

  four canadians had gathered on the
float and accepted the invitation not only
were they always interested in the viking
for she was a craft ideally constructed and
arranged for real cruising but they liked
j j ungrudgingly admired his seaman-
ship and were eager for news of the intri-
cate coastal waters from which he just had
come

  down in the big comfortable main cabin
j j pressed a button and sing john shuf-
fled in no gin no scotch no nothing
he began at once those hand loggels
they dlink you dly last week

  j j was only twenty-three and both as
a yachtsman and a host he was deeply
chagrined im awfully sorry he began

i never know-

  the slow steady lark of a big heavy
duty motor came from nearby and j js
face brightened hop over to the cleo-
patra sing and get a bottle from grand-
dad

  huh the chinaman exclaimed and
he made no movement who evel see
jack mead n black livel ben make polt
with bottle bet you five dollas ben he
telephone then tie his boat

  the canadians laughed uproariously
they had heard these discussions between
j j and sing john lefore when j j
was about to speak again there came a light
rap on the companion way hatch

  telephone message for captain mead
came a caretakers voice his father and
mother are at the hotel and wish to see him
as soon as he arrives

  thanks sliver j j called please
call dad and tell him ill be there in half an
hour im awfully sorry and he turned
to his guests twas going to have you

chaps stay for luncheon-

  lunch  sing john cried shrilly you
say you go one week you go thlee lat he
stalve on this packet no dlink no
glub allsame jap boat and he retired in
disgust to the galley

  j js guests laughed their way ashore
and j j crossed over to the cleopatra
now tied up in the next berth he found
jack mead his grandfather alone in the
galley

  wheres ben j j asked
telephoning say what were you
turning over this morning

sure never heard your whistle this
side of white rock wonder if our

here was a note of concern al-
most of apology in his voice he
was inordinately proud of his grand-
sons ability as a sailor and he tried des-
perately to conform with what he knew to
j js standards

jack mead was seventy-three and still
jack mead there was no stoop in his
broad shoulders no increase in his waist-
line except for his gray hair he ap-
peared much the same as the hell and high
water jack mead who had been king of the
swift river lumberjacks in wisconsin back
in the nineties and except when talk-
ing to his grandson he was still the rough
gruff dominant personality that had earned
a name and a reputation in the last days of
american river driving

 in no way had the millions forced by
him and his son jerry from the great for-
ts of oregon and wisconsin brought a
ge plain almost uncouth yet sturdy
d efficient the cleopatra served as an
adequate expression of the man and she
was his most beloved possession

 mother and dad are in vancouver
 j said

  flunky just told me jack answered
want me for lunch said i couldnt
tome

  the old mans voice had stiffened curi-
  lsly and his grandson looked at him in
  irprise

  got to get that wheel fixed jack
  ded dont like hotels anyhow

  but at three oclock that afternoon he
tered his sons suite j j had gone
k to the yacht club jerry mead and
wife gloria were alone

  hello dad jerry greeted his father
sit down been waiting two days for
m

  if hell and high water jack had not
ganged since his river pig days on the
jerry mead had physically he was
lfich the same tall finely built moving
vth the ease and grace acquired by those
jstose feet have spent much time in calked
hoes

but his face was lined his hair was gray
s speech was rapid sometimes brusque

   had the air of a man driven of one
frung too tightly

  gloria mead greeted her father-in-law
armly and the old mans eyes lighted at
nt of her for a few minutes they

   jo



talked exchanging bits of news making
inquiries it was scarcely a month since
they had seen each other and there could
be no clearer expression of the strong
bonds which united these three than the
quiet but unmistakably genuine manner
toward one another

  well whats eatin you lad jack
mead burst forth at last thought you
were fixed up to do anything with those
powers of attorney i signed

  they hardly cover what i have in
mind jerry answered moreover it is
a step in which i need your approval i
want to close out the mead lumber com-
pany consolidate with pacific lumber
products get out of the business

  close out the mead lumber company
jack mead repeated in a voice cracked by
incredulity you crazy

  im doing it because im sane jerry
retorted weve more money than we

need and im tired if j j-

  what about j j jack demanded
when jerry broke off

  there was a quick defense in the old
mans tone that brought a smile to gloria
meads eyes but jerry did not seem to have
caught it

  j j doesnt care about the business
he said dully hes tried it a couple of
times gets restless and pulls out far as
i have been able to learn he hasnt room in
his mind for anything except boats

  and there aint a man on the coast can
handle one any better the grandfather
interrupted hotly

  im not blaming him jerry said wear-
ily its his affair what he does in life
only-id always counted on it id fig-
ured it out id be fifty-seven when he
was thirty and i could step out leave it all
to him now theres no kick in it for me
its not logging its business finance
every tilings systematized run by rule
i might as well be head of a bank or a shoe

factory	

  and you trying to make the same thing
of him jack snorted

  its ten years since youve done a stroke
of work of any sort jerry reminded his

father	 

  and why back on the swift or
when we first come to the coast we were
loggers we wore stagged pants and
corked shoes and had hard hands and our
men called us by our first names and told
us to go to hell if they felt like it

  now whats it like and jack ar
and towered over his son ou madet e

ing a mead they both scared him out

tom there isnt a detail of the actual
logging he doesnt know backward but
he never showed any real interest he
doesnt care about logging

ben black who had complaine
ever since driving the black rrvi
in wisconsin that his name had b
come twisted was not quite as old as jau
mead many years before in a loggir

                                                          
his own logs

 town saloon he had told jerry mead he
 would like to work for a man who could
 whip him jerry promptly knocked him
 cold and for more than a quarter of a
 century black river ben had been unin-
 terruptedly in the mead employ

   shrewd whimsical loyal as only men of
 his time and class could be he was one of
 the last of the old river pigs of the middle
 west even when jerry and his father
 joined forces on the swift after a winter
 v of bitter warfare black river had ac-
 knowledged only one employer but later
 ou in oregon and washington when the
 mead company had expanded to a point
 where the personal relations of the old
 i wisconsin days were no longer possible
 when jack mead lost interest in an indus-
 try dependent
 upon machinery
 and operating on
 an e i g h t-hour
 day the old-time
 wisconsin lum-
 berjacks were
 drawn together
 by bonds of a
 com m o n past

id by j j

these two rough and grizzled whose eti-
ire lives had been devoted to three things
lly-hard working hard drinking and
ird fighting-became completely subservi-
lt to the wishes of a small boy and
len this boy sniffing the salt air of pu-
tt sound developed an interest in the
and boats two old men from the mid-
of a great continent acquired a forced
id often bitterly earned knowledge of
js and tidal currents of internal com-
istion engines and the rules of the salty

nor did they ever quite catch up with
j just as the cleopatra could never
lite keep pace with the viking their
terest became genuine the cleopatra be-
ie their home most of the year they
re members of a yacht club and con-
led more or less to yachting customs
it they carried to the sea their lumberjack
twpoint though this was compensated
in large part by their river pig courage
d resourcefulness

   theoretically black river ben was still
   the employ of the mead lumber com-
   fny still drew a monthly pay check and
   board and-also theoretically-black
   jver was the crew of the cleopatra but
   ule there may have been something
   jdal in the handing of lumberjacks un-
   a leader in the days long past there

      to



never liad been a trace of the master and
man relationship the bonds that held
oreman and crew together were those of
mutual respect a road monkey called his
wealthy employer by his first name

  and now while black river was still an
employe and jack mead a millionaire sev-
eral times over all was essentially equal
between them they shared each others
lives and problems as completely as they
sliared the task of combating wind and cur-
rent  and black river ben knew instantly
when old jack stormed down the compan-
ionway that something cataclysmic had hap-
pened yet he waited patiently when they
were seated in the comfortable main cabin
of the cleopatra and when the air was
dense with pipe smoke and a half empty
bottle of scotch stood on the table be-
tween them jack began to speak

  first time i talked to jerry i didnt say
much i got in a taxi to come out here and
then right at the yacht club i told the fellow
to turn back jigging around in that thing
had sort of shook up my brains and when
i got to the hotel i was able to say what id
wanted to say the first time id be saying
em yet only glory-i never saw her cry

before and-

  jack poured another drink and ben
stared incredulously

  you dont mean you and the lad went
to the floor together he demanded

  if you call speakin my mind that we
did

  but-not since that spring on the swift
-why you two been like a foot in an old
driving shoe

  jack mead growled and sputtered the
more because it was the first difference of
opinion between himself and his son in
twenty-five years

  but when he says j j isnt a logger he
might just as well say he isnt a mead

he declared

  theres other things j j cares more
about than logging black river remarked

  why shouldnt he who wants to go
logging the way they do it nowadays with
machines in summer hottern the hinges
of hell dust so thick you cant breathe
and-show j j a wet log that s all lie

needs	 

  it would have to be wet in salt water

there aint  more river driven

  theres lots of salt water and a good
many billion feet of timber along this

coast	

  the mead company owns quite a dir

why dont you turn j j loose on t
  lack mead did not reply he had blus
i	short stories

fiered and cursed he had gone hack to the

hotel and called down his son and yet way
down at the itortoni of his rough and loyal
old heart there was a cold sensation of
dread for like many another doting grand-
parent he had worshipped j j blindly

perhaps only gloria mead under-
stood that this devotion was some-
thing deeper however denied the
companionship of his own son until jerry
had attained dominant manhood all the
suppressed warmth and tenderness of the
rough old battler had been expended on
j j the boy was perfection and it was
this rather than the wiping out of the
mead name in he lumber industry that
had aroused jack mead

  no one understood jacks deep affection
any better than black river ben and yet
such was the relationship between the
owner and the crew of the cleopatra ben
did not hesitate to speak every man
sometime or other has got to take a lick-
ing he remarked j j has never had
his matter of fact he lias never had a
fight

  for the first time in ten years hell and
high water jack mead clenched a fist to
deliver a blow but black river ben did
not appear to see it

  and why he demanded because
of you any time he ever wanted any-
thing you gave it to him from that first
canoe right on up through the skipjack
and the claribcl and the frou frou and the
swan-those was two in one year-and the
bella bella and the baranof right up to
the viking you gave em to him soons he
knew he wanted em and there aint a
lad of his age on the coast has as fine a boat
as the viking all teak built in china cost-
ing orty-five thousand laid down in seat-
tle

  fight black river poured himself a
drink and downed it with a gesture of dis-
gust all hes ever had to do is wish-i

  jack mead was too angry to recognize
bens purpose they knew each other too
well for him not to understand under nor-
mal circumstances and there never had
been cause to doubt bens devotion to j j
t now jack only blundered blindly on
 s a mead and he can lick his weight
m anything that walks swims flies or
crawls he shouted hes a mead and
t here ain t been a mead licked since the
first log was cut in wisconsin how you
know he cant fight

   i dont know it only i never saw
him black river paused an instant as


if gauging jacks temper very much as a

blacksmith judges the coior of a piece of
heated steel and then he added and the
way things is going i dont think i ever

will

  he had judged correctly had struck at
the right moment jack swore violently
stamped about the cabin but he made no
direct reply above all else it was essen-
tial from jack meads viewpoint for a
man to be ready at an instants notice to
lattle with his body or his brain to com-
pel victory by sheer might and courage
fifty years before he had been named hell
and high water because neither had ever

daunted at
stopped him
and lie had tak-
en it for grant-
ed that hi t
grandson pos-
sessed thest
q u a  i t i e s ir

 i nevei
even seen bin
hit a man ber
added whei
jack subsided
ben was 
wise old man
he let it go a
that and hi
himself
deeply troa
bled so fas
as he was concerned there were only threr
people in the world each a mead and hk
all gods they must retain perfection and
despite all he had said he had perfect faid
that j j was everything he had suggeste
he might not be

  j j himself appeared when the discus-
sion finally ended that night he had hat
dinner with his father and mother and ther
had seen them aboard the night boat foi
seattle

  dads getting frisky he commented x
he sat down beside his grandfather tak-
ing a few days off just for a pleasure
jaunt

  jack looked searchingly at his grand-
sons smiling face is that all jerry cam
for he asked

  far as t know unless he talked busi-
ness with you

  nothing he said to me sounded like
business what you figurin on doing to-
morrow

  j j thrust out his legs and stared at his
shoes there was just a suggestion of a
his own logs

frown on his face a look of puzzlement in
his eyes i think ill drift back up the
jcoast he said

  aint you going to the regatta over at
cowichan bay black river ben de-
manded thought that was what we
come down for

  and that reliability run from seattle to
victoria jack added in amazement you
only got to win once more to get the cup
or keeps

  they dont make those races hard
enough j j exclaimed with sudden ve-
jiemence eighty miles-you do it in a
tide boats are finishing so close to the
estimated time its practically a perfect per-
formance if theyd run a few hundred

miles-

  the young mans eyes lighted at the
rospect of such a contest and then he
lnigged his shoulders

  i was sort o hoping we would get into
  it black river said plaintively

  go on you two j j urged you
re only fifty-seven seconds off last year
ou got a good chance to win

  our wheels been jimmed jack ob-
  ted

  haul out tomorrow get u trued up
  ce on all the gas you can o youll be us-
  the same quality right through run to
  ittle in daylight and check absolutely on
  ur time work out what you think youll
  it in and you can win that race

  j j was interested now and enthused
  fe slapped his grandfather on the back
  id give most anything to have you clean
  he cried theres a couple of fel-
  ts with big boats and crews who think
  re got things down pretty fine

  but where you going jack insisted
  back up the coast and again j j
  iped down in his seat come up after
  regatta ill leave word with henry
  iere i am

  t noon the next day the cleopatra
  had been hauled out and twenty-
  four hours later she was headed
  ith in the gulf of georgia two old
  drove her checking off distances
  idying tide tables always watching the
  thometer the first of the next week
  made the run from seattle to victoria
  thin fifteen seconds of their estimated
  while no other yacht was within half
  hour of the performance expected

  no need for us to get so swelled up
  remarked late that night when the last
  ite-flanneled visitor had left the clco-
  tras main cabin if it hadnt been for



j j telling us how to figure that tide-

   its still a mead cup jack growled
and then after a moment he added i
wonder what the lads doing

  he had something on his mind ben
declared and if i didnt know j j id
think it was a girl

   but girls were as scarce as orchids among
the intricate channels the viking and her
skipper were traversing and as far from
j js mind moreover not even he could
have explained why he suddenly decided to
abandon his intention of entering the race
he was hardly conscious of a growing rest-
lessness since the opening of the cruising
season and that last night in vancouver he
only knew that he wanted to get back
among the high mountains and swift wa-
ters beyond the gulf of georgia

   alone except for sing john he had left
the city behind him about the time tlie cleo-
patra was being hauled out that night
he anchored in a delightful little cove on
nelson island a spot doubly delightful be-
cause it was not on the charts and before
noon the next day he had reached the rag-
ged islands

   there venturing out into the gulf and
the long dreary pull to vancouver came a
tug with a tow of logs a mile away j js
glasses had told him it was the grizzly and
when it was abreast he had already turned
ready to come alongside

  the viking and the grizzly had once
ridden out a gale together in smugglers
cove and captain billy joyce himself came
down to the deck to take the vikings bow
line in a moment the two were fast

  trying to break your record j j
asked as captain joyce came aboard
youll lose some logs

  not between here and powell river
joyce grinned wheres the cleopatra

  regatta at cowichan the glass is
dropping fast

   i know but the wind won t come before

dark

   hoav do you figure that

  captain joyce smiled he understood
t t and his methods of getting lnforma-
 and there are no better judges of

weather on the
pacific than the
towboat skippers
who take logs
down the hun-
dred miles of
boisterous a n d

 whats the matter with the paper com-
 panys tugs j j demanded when he had
 tucked away an added bit of weather wi-

 dom

 between one being overhauled and an-
 other towing a camp outfit they got caught

 pass you in the fog when i come up on th

okisollo some day  get me a yacht an
then the steamship company can yust hai
my freight and not me

   come aboard j j invited

   the viking had never been given a mor
 thorough or more admiring or possibl
 less intelligent inspection than she receive
 from jensen the most ordinary detail c
 pleasure craft equipment awakened an a
 most childish interest

  she ban all teak eh he demand
b jiminv this main cabin she pretty
never see a sleeping car look so nice and
ban go forth and back on em quite a ll
down in washington

j j pressed a button and sing jol

always talking about the boat hes going apieared with a bottle of scotdi and thr
          i  i-i	an it	lenten stared with admiration i

 to own and what hes going to do with it

 ers going to scrap this steam plant and put

 tered

    i would if i had the money

   money

   i mean my own money thats the
 only kind there is

    start in with the viking

    j j laughed i could build a good tug
 for what she cost he said

   when you get started let me know
 id like to work for you

    id already counted on that

 at noon the next day the yacht and
 the tug drew in to carl jensens
 lcamp

   for two days jensen had been fuming
 because of the nonappearance of the tug
 but he forgot it the moment he saw the
 pleasure boat he stood on his float
 watching her slide toward him white clean
 bright work shining brass gleaming sixty
 feet of nautical perfection and beauty

   bjimmy captain thats the kind of
 boat im going to have only bigger he
 called to joyce

   when your boom gets in eh joyce
 laughed

   but the loggers exuberance could not
 be dulled by any such practical considera-
 tions

    i ban hearing about you he said af-
 ter the boats had been made fast and he

 glasses jensen stared with admiration
 the white jacketed servant

   b jiminv i have me a yacht yet j
 exclaimed	 j

   if you had a tug you could trade it f
 this one captain joyce suggested

   i ban got no tug but b jiminy i tra
 this logging outfit for it

   joyce ivrgheu until he saw j j leanr
 forward and staring at the logger

  what you got here the young mi
asked sharply

   three donkeys and a contract to cut f
 million feet jensen said its a ft
 show all the timber right on the side
 this mountain i put in less than half
 million this boom it the first ten si
 lions altogether	jl

   j j asked innumerable questions abcl
 the donkeys and equipment the owner
 the timber the nature of the contract lx
 tain joyce stared at him curiously

   you come ashore jensen said
show you

   together they went over the operation
 while joyce fastened on to his tow x
 men stared curiously at the yachtsman
 white flannels as he scrambled abo
 watching asking questions at the e
 of two hours he had seen everything cc
 nected with the outfit

   back at the float j j was about to j
 aboard the viking when he saw a man wj
 a pickpole working on the logs that hi
 come down the long slide into salt watt
 he stared for an instant then turned
 tensen

  go below he said make yours
at home if you want a drink call bn
john

   he walked down the shore and out on


his own logs

tc boom the man working there was
fciast sixty small apparently clumsy in his
talked shoes but there were no waste
notions every act spoke efficiency and
iertitude his work was a beautiful thing
o watch

i where did you drive j j demanded

 tlie logger looked at him curiously

 and the swift j j cut in how

go chaseum self

often you been drunk in kettle falls
j the old-timer grinned you from
wisconsin  he asked

i born in minnesota when did you
leave there 

f they were off sam creer who had
logged straight across a continent from
jiaine to washington was in an alien land
and engaged in an occupation that bore
tie resemblance to the lumbering methods
his youth he could not make out this
kite clad stranger and he had a natural
spicion of anyone from a yacht but
j had aroused old and pleasant mem-
es and he knew the language of the

river driving
days that were
gone forever
so sam
 bloomed like an
old dog long
neglected that
suddenly re-
ceives attention
he became gar-
rulous compar-
ed the old days
with the present
and answered
js questions with profane and eniight-
ng comments after half an hour the
ung man went back to the yacht

  there he found carl jensen pacing forth
   back on the after deck there was a
  gestion of the possessive in his attitude
  stride

      jiminy i trade you my whole outfit
  this boat and ten thousand dollars he
  laimed

    j stared at him coldly you will

    	he answered curtly youll trade
  aiht one for the other

  jensen protested became violent but
  hing could shake the young man and
  that afternoon the logger capitulated
  ten minutes the viking was under way
  fled through the yuciuetaws for van-
  ver and seattle

    

the presentation of cups at cowi-
chan did not come until the last night
of vie regatta and early the next
morning the cleopatra was heading north
through sansum narrows her skipper
en  rrw wou have telegraphed or radi-
oed j j of their victory had he been with-
in reach of such communication now
they made all speed to find him

  that night after crossing the gulf with
a stiff northwest wind on the portbow that
shook them up a bit they anchored in the
little nelson island cove where the viking
had stopped more than a week before th
next afternoon just south of grief point
black river ben came up the after com-
panionway to see the viking a mile behind
them

immediately the cleopatra was hove to
been down to vancouver again jack
mead commented as they waited he
probably figured wed be along here today
ben stared then picked up the glasses
whats he carrying all those flags for 
he demanded looks like a circus boat
the cleopatra and the viking had their
own private signals a code of long and
short blasts of the whistle and jack
grasped the cord but there -was no re-
sponse from the white craft astern in an-
swer to his tooting

  ben had dived below and now appeared
with the big silver cup they had won he
waved it high over his head as he stood on
the after deck still they received no rec-
ognition from the viking

  the yacht was close enough now for
them to see several figures on her decks
the two old men stood and stared mum-
bling their astonishment when the i iking
swerved toward them and slackened speed

  for a moment the flags drew the atten-
tion of jack and ben there was a big
american ensign at the peak and one at the
taffrail and from each end of the spreader
arm hung a royal ensign from the mast
head streamed a vice-commodore s pennant
and on each stay the burgee of the seattle

yacht club	   tv

hes gone crazy exclaimed jack

whose own knowledge of flags and their

use had been acquired with much effort

and perplexity	 

  a resplendent figure stepped out ot the
vikings pilothouse door and stared at
them the sun glinted from qnibes
of gold braid on his blue cot - - 
cap
short stories

 its a circus and ben swore

 a white clad steward came to the after

 deck a blue cap and jumper appeared at
 the engine-room hatch and through the
 pilothouse windows jack saw a stranger at
 the vikings wheel

 what ban the matter r came a voice

 you want a tow

 wheres j j  demanded jack mead
 ignoring- the others question

 i dont know him

 youd better know him he owns that
 boat jack roared

 i tan carl jensen and this ban my
 yacht if you mean that young feller
 mead he sold it to me

 sold it you stole it and jack
 reached for the clutch lever intending to
 run alongside

 well i trade my lumber camp for it
 which is the same thing jensen said com-
 placently she ban one fine boat this
 yacht

 wheres j j ben asked

 he ban running the camp  guess he
 tell me he going right up

 where is this camp

 cordero channel

 never mind that jack cut in you
 get your papers fella im coming aboard
 and see em

 he brought the cleopatra alongside the
 now motionless viking and jensen went
 below

 five minutes later both boats were on
 their way north the viking still beautiful
 despite her flag strung rigging the cleo-
 patra sturdy and efficient slowly dropping
 astern

 in her pilothouse were two astounded
 old men

 thats why he wouldnt go to cowi-
 chan bay ben said

 jack mead said nothing and after a
 while ben black made one of the few psy-
 chological mistakes of his life and you
 give him that boat he lamented forty-
 live thousand laid down in seattle

 and when i gave it to him it was his
 jack snapped youd better take a look
 around in the engine-room

they were compelled to tie up at
henrys boom because of the tide in
the yucluetaws and for the first
time in their numerous visits they did not
fish for salmon that evening further-
more the genial henry found that they did
not even wish to talk the next morning
they were gone

 j j was in the little building on a float

which served both as office and living quar-
ters when he heard the familiar exhaust
of the cleopatra he went out and sig-
naled that she could tie up beside him then
took the bow line when ben threw it

   methodically hut smartly and in silence
the two old river drivers made their craft
secure shut off the engine took down and
furled ensigns and pennant then aftei
a last glance to see that every tiling was
shipshape they turned and inspected whai
was to lie seen on shore

  we won that cup jack said at last

   j j let out a whoop sprang aboard tlv
cleopatra and pounded them on the bacl
until they winced

  i knew you could he cried ho
far off were you

   fifteen seconds

   better than i did last year

   the next nearest was a half hour fast
ben offered

   j js exultant shout followed and ther
was nothing perfunctory in that applause
the two old men knew that for then
strangers to salt water until they wer
nearly sixty to have taken the cup from th
crack yachts of seattle vancouver an
victoria had brought a keener joy tha
t j had ever derived from his own vi
tories

   the excitement died down after a tirr
ben and jack stared toward shore wal-
ing j j watched their puzzled faces i
silence

   guess ill go down and clean up the er
gine ben said after a few moments

  j t- walked toward the accommodate
ladder

  might as well wash those break fan
dishes jack observed as he started b

low	 j

  yet whatever may have been their n
tentions neither could have kept avva
from shore while j j was busy in tr
office they looked over the operations

   it was an inspection conducted entirel
in silence though most of their own lo
ging days had been spent in the midd
west they knew the machinery methods c
the pacific coast they had not been o
shore fifteen minutes before they realize
just how inefficiently operated was th
camp j j had purchased even the sloi
and indifferent manner of the crew did nc
escape them

   and hes still wearing his white pant
and yacht cap jack said moodily whet
they were again aboard the cleopatra

   ben let it go at that he had not seei
anything that would permit a comiortinj
                     his own logs
reilsstimjtce and they stared at each other



a moment in si-
lence they
were bewilder-
ed and a bit
afraid and the
situation was
entirely beyond
their compre-
hension

  if hed only
said be wanted
to do anything
like this jack
began at last
youd v

given him a
couple of camps i suppose like youve
given him everything else he ever asked
for ben growled he went out not
waiting for a comment leaving a dejected
lonely figure in the cabin

  during the remainder of the morning
j j in his brief encounters with them
failed to take them into his confidence so
far as that young man gave evidence in
speech or manner trading a yacht for a
logging camp was of no more importance
or interest than the purchase of a new
scrubbing brush for use on the vikings
spotless decks he was busy in his little
office while jack and ben wandered along
the mountainside and when they were back
aboard the cleopatra he himself went from
one donkey to another in the half hour be-
fore lunch

  in one respect carl jensens outfit had
been well equipped from a larger oper-
ator who had gone broke he had purchased
a complete floating camp-bunkhouses
cookhouse blacksmith shop and office all
these buildings well constructed comfor-
taole rested on rafts of great cedar logs
there was a large scow too for the don-
keys and it was a simple matter with the
assistance of a tug to move the entire camp
and working equipment anywhere along the
coast once moored in a quiet bay work
could begin almost immediately while a
few lengths of pipe would connect a spring
with the float and provide running water
for cookhouse and shower baths

a

t noon sing john went aboard the
cteopalra and asked jack and ben
to have their midday meal with j j
fhey had been waiting for the invitation
for they knew it meant an opportunity to
learn what was being done in that most im-
portant department of logging in british
columbia the commissary

the crew trooped down the mountain-
side and across the boomsticks to the float
jack and ben wise in the ways of men who
work in the woods were quick to read the
story not only indifference to the job but
insolence was displayed in carriage and
facial expression such a camp lost money
every day

  j j- flanked by his grandfather and
black river ben sat at the liead of the long
table the crew down the sides as in all
ging camps there was complete silence
except for the clatter of knives forks and
dishes and low whispered requests to pass
the meat

  into this funereal assemblage burst sing
john his eyes ablaze that cook he
tellum me get hell out he cried shrilly
he say boss no boss he runum kitchen
no want china boy

  several men snickered j j looked up
inquiringly the cook appeared in the
door i dont want this dirty chink
around he declared he thinks he
knows too much all the time buttin in
and telling me what to do

  there was something very boyish in
j js expression his eyes were always
questioning and his smooth face placid
even his voice was mild there was about
him the air of one who had always found
life very delightful and interesting and
easy

  i think he said slowly and quietly
that sing john knows more about cooking
than you do hell take charge after this
meal

  whatever was the cooks reaction to this
calm statement no one except the cook
knew sing john with a shrill squeal
drew all attention

  you go chasettm self j j he cried
me no iummel camp cook me nevel hile
out cook iummel camp you go chaseum
self lound block

  only j j seemed undisturbed by the on-
slaught which quickly developed into shrill
chinese j j had a healthy appetite and
he kept on eating after a moment sing
john calmed down and went into the

kitchen	a	

  one of the crew tittered another guf-
fawed they all laughed go chaseum
self one exclaimed and they roared

  j j remained undisturbed and contin-
ued to eat but to jack mead anti black
river ben there had come an overpowering
perturbation never had they seen j j
in a similar situation but never had there
been doubt in their loyal hearts ot his an
ity to meet it


short stories

 

  back there in vancouver when they had
sat long over a bottle in the cleopatras
main cabin there had been only a purpose
in bens statement tliat he had never seen
j j fight it had hurt him to say it like
jack he looked upon the young man as
completely and thoroughly mead and no
mead ever had stood for open insolence 
the part of an employe

  now for the first time in many years they
found food distasteful they quickly fin-
ished went out and climbed aboard the
cleopatra from her main cabin they
heard the men stamping out of the cook-
house

  go chaseum self someone snickered
go chaseum self lound block

  there was raucous laughter

  if little white pants will take that from
a chink what would he take from a white
man another asked and snorts of dis-
gust followed

  jack and ben did not dare look at each
other they were two sick and miserable
old men life had suddenly ceased the
gloom of a british columbia coast winter
was as bright sunshine compared with the
dejection that filled the main cabin

for a long time they sat there star-
ing with sightless eyes and then as
one man they arose ben went into
the engine-room and started the motor
jack on deck to cast off the lines and
as they gathered headway and stood out to-
ward the channel neither turned to look
at the camp they were leaving

  j j heard them waved an unheeded
farewell and then turned back to his office
he was his own timekeeper and each af-
ternoon he had spent several hours trying
to get the books in shape and determine just
where he stood the blackness of his dis-
coveries left little time or energy for the
emotional problems of others

  at the conclusion of his work he made
out seven time checks signed them and
took them with him when he went out

  it was only a few minutes before five
quitting time and j j slowly walked
ashore there at the end of the boom-
stick was a small level space and in the
center of it he waited

  the men came saw him there and grin-
ned as they approached the third a rig-
ging shnger a little taller and heavier than
j j- was the one who had exclaimed go
chaseum self at the table that noon

  heres your time j j said quietly as
the man passed til take you over to

johnstone strait so you can catch a boat

for town tonight

  all the men stopped the rigging

slinger looked at
his check in
amazement and
then he laughed

  i go chaseum
myself eh he
asked

 if youre
able j j said

  he had step-
ped back and
laid the six re-
maining time checks on a stump weight-
ing them with a piece of granite then he
whirled and slapped the rigging slinger in
the face

  the man staggered away too amazed to
do more than catch his balance and then
with a roar he charged

  it was not a short fight the rigging
slinger was confident and he was mad and
he was bigger than j j for a time he
rushed his late employer off his feet sent
him spinning with a wild swing j js
white trousers were smeared with black
soil and his white shirt was stained with his
own blood

  and then j j began to fight craft and
a certain deliberateness and determination
rather than any skill were the factors that
began to make themselves felt after
three minutes the rigging slinger found
himself on the defensive two minut-
later he knew he was licked

  it was then that a hook tender thrust out
a foot as j j charged past immediately
the man found himself facing two gleaming
butcher knives in the hands of an infuri-
ated chinaman

  wild with excitement sing john chased
the hook tender into the water and then
whirled ready to repel any other interfer-
ence

  clackum head j j he shrieked as he
brandished the knives clackum head
big stiff no good clackum head and
throwum in salt chuck

  breathless but cool and steady j j
swung heavily and the rigging slinger spun
half around and sat down he did not
get up

  j j shook his head wiped the blood
from his face with a sleeve and stepped
back to the stump where he selected an-
other time check

  heres yours he called to the hook
tender who had climbed onto the boom-
stick come and get it

                                                           
iiis own logs

  what do i gel with it the fellow de-
manded

  that depends on how much you can
take

  it wasnt much the men watched in
disappointment sing john danced with
glee and shouted strange words before
it was over the men were laughing when
the hook tender rolled out of harms way
j j turned back to the stump

   five more of you get your time he
said i dont think we would get along
well together take you to rock bay to-
night

he passed out the checks and then
walked down to the water across
the boomstick and into the office

  a half hour later bathed in clean shirt
and fresh white flannels his face bruised
and scratched he came out at sound of the
gong and entered the cook camp where he
took his place at tlie head of the table

  the men looked at him covertly and
not without admiration there was some-
thing very youthful in his expression and
actions something charmingly boyish that
would have aroused only their scorn had
it not been for that scene on the shore

 and when they began to eat for a
time there was the usual silence and then
someone in a stage whisper asked for an-
other hunk of that yorkshire pudding

  the men laughed

  boss said a bucker an old man known
the length of the b c coast for his com-
ments ill wear white pants myself to
hold down a job in a place where they feed
like this aint had nothing like it since
the duke and i went hunting grizzlies

  go chaseum self sing john called
from the kitchen door and turned away
with apparent disgust but sing john
knew how well he could cook

  the next morning j j appeared in wool
trousers work shirt and calked shoes
there were only enough men to operate
two donkeys but there was an entirely dif-
ferent atmosphere on that mountainside

  down at the bottom damp from the
spray thrown high into the air by the huge
fir sticks striking the salt chuck with all
the force of speeding tons was j j pol-
ing logs into place ready for the boom-
ing

  there was a smile on his smooth face
that grew the harder he worked some-
times he was swamped and he grinned the
more for never had logs come down that
slide in such numbers

  far up the hillside there was even a dif-

ferent note in the shrill tooting of the
whistle punks in the whine of the winches
in the stuttering exhaust of the donkeys

  into this scene of cheery industry the
cleopatra nosed her way a week after her
departure she drew up at the float beside
the office in as smart a landing as any born
sailor ever made for several minutes
there was the meticulous almost ceremon-
ial business of making fast the lines at bow
and stern a spring line the dropping of
fenders the shutting off of the motor the
furling of ensigns at last two old men
stepped ashore

  their wise eyes had taken in the fir sticks
shooting down the skidway the clouds of
vapor from the donkeys the boomsticks
shoved far out from shore by the accumu-
lated logs their ears had caught the fre-
quent tooting of whistles and the sound of

saws and their
sore old hearts
were soothed by
undreamed o f
joy

  sing john ap-
peared in the
cookhouse door
and stared with-
out apparent
recognition

proached

chapter iv

swindled 

a half hour after their arrival at
j js camp jack mead and black
river ben repaired to the main cabin
of the cleopatra and as ben tore the
tissue wrapper then the cap off a bottle
of scotch there was something reverent in
the attitude of the two men

  the first drink thats tasted natural to
me in moren a week ben said when he
had set down his glass

  i been off it too jack added and that
was as far as they let sentiment carry them

  they turned instead to practical things
i mind that sam creer ben said re-
ferring to the old river driver whom j - j
had left in charge of the work jut a
short stories

young lad drivin the black one spring
says he worked for me jack contri-
buted he knows the swift anyhow but
you notice hes got a hunch of old-timers
with him minnesota and wisconsin lads
j j sent creer out to round em up
first thing when he took over the camp
thats one reason theres so much git up
and go to the crew

  seventy thousand feet in the chuck
yesterday thats going some hell be
making money at that rate

  there was silence and another drink
at last ben after rubbing his chin a long
time ventured a question wliat you
suppose j j is going to do when he stubs
a toe good and hard

  jack did not answer this at once he
considered it for a time and then in tribute
to bens keener mind he asked what if
he dont

  one of the finest tilings that ever hap-
pened to any man is to get both toes
bunged up ben declared

  and his knuckles too jack added
there was another drink and more si-
lence a huge fir log slithered down the
slide five hundred feet at a forty-five de-
gree angle and hit the salt chuck with
geyser effect whistles tooted there
was the roar of falling forest monarchs

  anyhow ben said you were right
the lads a logger hes making this run
down outfit pay

  of course and jack was merely ac-
cepting an axiomatic truth hes a mead
and hes putting in his own logs

  they waited with some impatience for
the arrival of the okisollo the next day
and when j j stepped onto the float they
were there to meet him

  there were no traces of the battle of the
previous week nor of worry or responsibil-
ity his expression was untroubled jack-
slapped him on the back in an awkward
shamefaced way youre getting in some
logs he said

  need to j j replied shortly hows
the cleopatra

  frisky as ever ben caught a fifty-six
pound tyee the other night at henrys
pretty close to your record eh i
thought you two probably were down
there

   there was an absent note in j js voice
that  only ben caught and the young
mans eyes were on the freight that was be-
ing unloaded on the white plumes of vapor
up the mountainside on the logs inside the
boom then he caught sight of sam creer
and hurried toward him

  after a few minutes ben slipped away
and halted just out of hearing of j j and
his foreman the young man looked up
and saw him standing there

  anything the matter j j asked
  not with us and ben accented the last

word a bit unnecessarily only-

  thats good j j said with apparent
relief as he joined ben because  wont
have a chance for a chat with you two just
came up to see how tilings are going and
im taking the okisollo back to vancou-
ver

  if you had the viking you wouldnt
have to worry about steamships ben
growled

  but then i wouldnt have this and
j js eyes were laughing when he added
and all that goes with it

  thats just what i was thinking lad
but now you got it and-and- he hesi-
tated and j j stared at him

  i aint saying you havent done fine
ben hurried on but two heads are bet-
ter than one and no ones ever said yet that
old jack mead wasnt a logger besides
he dont understand the kind of a lone
game youre playing

  j j looked away even ben could not
know how keenly that appeal had touched
him for j j had only two idols hell and
high water jack mead and his own
father but the youths mouth straight-
ened slightly granddad ought to under-
stand he said gently he played it once
himself did you ever see either dad or
granddad ask another man to put in his
logs for him

 no ben agreed only-

  thats the answer and j j was his
old cheerful unruffled self ive got to
run for it you two hang around until i
get back from vancouver

  he called the last over his shoulder and
ran up the gangplank just as the okisollos
lines were cast off

  so long he called to his grandfather
jack and ben watched the steamship
draw away and then wandered back to the
cleopatra but when they sat down in
the main cabin neither opened the conven-
ient locker door behind which there was
always a bottle there was something
rather comical-and rather pitiful-in
these two old men suddenly grown very
old and forlorn

  after a long time black river ben
laughed a man grows up and then he
grows down he said you and me
were all through and we get it into our
heads we could spend the rest of our time
his own logs

paying around with j j we talked but
way down at the bottom we was wishin
hed stick around with us and now-
he stopped and chuckled

  jack glared at him now what he
demanded

  j js growed up and gone off and left
us to play around alone and being
young hes sort of forgot were on earth
ben was philosopher enough to touch the
hurt and to laugh but he had to phil-
osophize alone all his life jack mead
had been swayed purely by emotions he
could not analyze he merely reacted and
he was reacting now to j js failure to
take him into his confidenceto tell anything
about his plans his hopes his troubles

  i aint so old i he exclaimed rebel-
liously at last i may have quit but it
wasnt because i had to

  what you thinking of doing ben
asked

  im going to put some wrinkles in that
lads face

  he got up and went on deck far up
the mountainside he saw sam creer at the
edge of the slash and climbed until he
found him

  hundreds of men like sam creer had
worked for jack mead back on the swift
river in wisconsin and there was nothing
about them jack did not know but sam
jack soon discovered possessed very little
of the information he wanted he was
talkative and merely to be working for a
man who knew something of the old swift
river days had been enough to arouse his
enthusiasm and loyalty moreover he had
not been slow to impart to the crew much
of the mead history so that something
more had been added to the prestige j j
had gained by whipping the hook tender
and the rigging slinger

  in the end jack had to be content with
one thing tossed m as he was about to
leave hes a hustler sam chuckled
and though you might not think it to look



at him he aint afraid to take a chance
get the logs into the chuck as fast as steam
and gravity can get em there was the last
thing he said to me and he says dont
get mad and fire a man cause there aint
enough money in the bank to pay him 
thif jack reported one thing to ben
the lad s a hustler w hat you say we eo
back to henrys

  ben studied him a moment and then as-
sented

  and so the cleopatra was sailing east-
ward as the okisollo came down from
frederick arm they saw j j waving to
them on the bridge they waved in reply
and gave the old signal with their whistle
but when they went on bucking through
the last ebb in the yucluetaws neither
looked back they could not any more
than they could have put their appalling
loneliness into words

  and there were times in the week that
f- followed when j j wished he were
jl back aboard the piking glancing out
of an after window of the pilothouse and
seeing the sturdy old cleopatra shoving the
salt chuck out of her way he recalled
times when they had anchored together in
remote inlets or coves when they had
tramped up mountain valleys in search of
hidden trout streams and of course the
long evenings aboard when jack and ben
had redriven the swift and retold jerry
meads exploits as a budding lumberman

  it was from ben at various times when
jack was absent that j j had learned of
the memorable struggle between the father
and son separated since jerrys babyhood
and how they had met after a bitter winter
each with a crew of sixty men at his back
and each detenuined to take possession of
the south lake dam and the precious wa-
ter behind it

  you  live a long long time lad betore
you see any man show more nerve than
your dad did ben would tell the eager
	short

youngster hell and high water jack
mead was vour granddad a man whod
never- been licked king of the swift
river lumberjacks he was if ever there

was a king in america

  and jerry worshipping his dad and
doing his best to ruin him because he knew
it was the only way they could get together
-by his licking his own father

  he could fight some himself jerry
could i know ive seen him and ive
felt him just one-eighth of a second was
all he needed to settle me like a mule

  but old jack every time  see a fir
log coming down into the chuck i think of
his fist jerry knew it saw jack fight
once or twice and boys oh boys if
they ever mixed it

  ben would stare back over the years
his old eyes shining

  but they didnt fight the boy had al-
ways insisted at this point

  they fought for logs and for the first
time in his life hell and high water had
it put over on him thats how it come
they got together man to man just after
dawn that spring morning at the south
lake dam

  i guess sonny i was the only man of
the hundred and twenty there that knew
just what was going on in those two mead
minds i dont think even they knew
they only felt

  you see jerry had to beat jack and
jerry knew that but he couldnt bring
himself to humble the old man he just
couldnt

  see what a ticklish point that was what
your dad was up against and thats
where he showed his nerve here was
jack coming for him blood in both eyes
and a sledge hammer head at the end of
each arm jerry couldnt run he wouldnt
fight he just stood there smiling never
batting a lash looking straight into old
jacks eyes and took it

  boys oh boys ive had a good time
livin but id been satisfied to die right
there when one of jacks men laughed
and said jerry was yellow you should have
seen old hell and high water he nearly
jailed the fellow and then he says hes a
better man than any ten of you damn your
souls and hes your boss because hes a bet-
ter man than i am 

j j had grown up with that story
ringing in his ears  for to black river
ben it was an epic of all time and of
all people more than once jerry mead

stories

had caught his young son looking at him
with wide eyes and liad wondered and
into young manhood j j liad carried vi-
sions of those grand old days back among
the snow enshrouded forests and along
rushing spring freshets while lexington
and gettysburg had always been second to
that battle on the swift

  j j thought of those things when from
the okisolios bridge he saw the cleopatra
plowing on into the yucluetaws and for
the first time there was a suggestion of a
crease in his forehead as he turned and
looked south

  down there he knew he must stage a
little battle of his own not with fists not
facing bodily punishment but with wits
and-he was beginning to understand-
with a courage that must be greater ijecause
he was not bolstered by onlookers by any
of the stimulating elements of drama

  so far j j had accomplished two
things he had welded a good crew be-
hind him and he was getting in logs fast
enough to know he could make money

  but he was well aware that this is less
than half the battle for the british colum-
bia logging contractor capital to meet the
payroll credit to feed the men and buy new
equipment-these were necessary to keep
going and j j had neither

  nor was there hope of getting any from
his logging operations the owner of the
timber needing quick money and relying
on the fact that he had an exceptional
show a limit easily logged had driven
a hard bargain because contractors were
eager to get the work he had been able to
stipulate that no money would be paid until
three million feet were in vancouver so
far jensen had sent out less than half a
million

  that left two and a half millions to go
before any money would be forthcoming
j j had ascertained the accuracy of thati
simple sum in arithmetic over and over
while sitting in his little office six weeks
of work at top speed and then the long
dreary delay while a tug captain jockeyed
with the weather all the length of the gulf
of georgia to wait that long was impos--
sible somewhere and at once he had to
get money

  from vancouver he went directly to
seattle where he sold his motor car and
turned bis r class sloop over to a boat
broker who gave him no encouragement
for a sale until the following season
luckily jerry and gloria mead were out
of the city and the son escaped any explan-
ations

                                                                
his own logs

  back in vancouver he visited a wholesale
grocer and after much argument got a
small amount of credit with wire cable
he was not successful and then the day
before the okisollo was to make her weekly
trip he went to the bank in which he had
already opened an account with the savings
from his allowance

  the cashier was startled by the frank
almost ingenuous explanation of the situa-
tion and then his wits began to work

jensen he said carl jensen that
name-



 in to see you again some day and he was

 gone

j

he called a clerk asked for a certain file
ran through some papers when he looked

                         up it was with
                         hard cold eyes
                         when did you
                         purchase this
                         logging outfit 
                         he asked

                       two weeks
                     ago

                      it was un-
                      encumbered 
                      of course
                      more ques-
                      could not under-
                      the strange

 or

stand their significance
sharpness in the cashiers tone

  i would advise you to see a solicitor
the banker said at last for a moment i

believed-

  but i did have a lawyer arrange the
transfer j j interrupted hes a
friend of mine over at the yacht club
he owns the clio

  i suggest that you get an attorney who
spends more time ashore was the dry
comment this man jensen is from the
states he operated through the forma-
tion of a company here of which he was
president may twentieth he borrowed
ten thousand dollars giving the companys
camp equipment as security the mort-
gage was not filed until ten days ago we
discounted the note it will be due 
august twentieth

  bankers often break hard news and they
are accustomed to see men react in vari-
ous ways when a shock comes or hope is
gone but the cashier could not associate
this case with anything he had ever en-
countered the clear young eyes still
stared into his the youthful face remained
untroubled

  perhaps i have not made myself clear
the banker began kindly

  oh i got you j j answered read-
 ly ive been gypped i was just fig-
uring how-thanks for your time ill be

j called up his yachtsman law-
yer and made an appointment then
telephoned to the yacht club and
asked for one of the caretakers

  whos been up the coast lately sliver
he asked

  several boats were named

any of them speak of sighting me
well captain mead sliver began in
an emljarrassed voice and j j laughed

  wondered what had happened to the
viking or to me eh he asked i sold
her sliver so im not responsible for all
the glad rags she is wearing

  he asked more questions discovered
that the viking had been sighted the day
previous headed north in lewis channel
and five minutes later he was in his law-
yers office

  talbert he began at once youre go-
ing to loan me one thousand dollars
on what security the lawyer asked
with a grin for he specialized in lumber
jid there was little about the meads tliat he
did not know

  your own reputation

  mine what do you mean

  j j told about jensens note for ten
thousand dollars

  you let me in for that he concluded
i hired you to look after this for me and
thats the way you did it itll make bad
advertising for you

  talbert drew out a checkbook and began
to write now he said when he had
blotted the slip of paper and handed it
across the desk to j j heres what
we-

  ill tell you something about law mari-
time law j j interrupted but first
when are you going to take your annual
cruise

  next week

  you are not you stay in  ancouver
and heres what i want you to do

  he drew his chair closer leaned across
the desk and for several minutes he talked
rapidly wrhen he had finished he jumped

to his feet	 

  ive just time to get to my bank ne

said and was gone

  t j was on the bridge of the okiolo
all the wav up the gulf the next day and
there wasnt a craft on the water that he
didnt watch anxiously through the geb

it is irritating travel taking a

short stories

 

post office and fishing hamlet there are
long detours up inlets and through narrow
twisting channels and it seems the ship is
hardly clear of one float and the lines are
coiled before she is sliding in to another

  j j found the twenty-four hours be-
fore reaching his cainp particularly try-
ing for much depended on what he would
find when he reached it yet it was cap-
tain mackaye who discovered what he
wanted most to know

   theres your old packet he said as
they rounded a point jensen had to
come back and let his old crew know that
he owned a yacht

  it was that very trait in the scandi-
navians character upon which j j had
counted from the stories of captain
mackaye and towboat skippers from his
own observations on their trip to seattle
together he had believed that jensen could
not resist the temptation to return to the
scenes of his logging operations and ex-
hibit his proud possession

  the viking was as resplendent as ever
and half a mile away j j could see the
new owner sitting on the after deck be-
yond her dull and drab in comparison lay
the black and gray cleopatra

  j j was grinning like a small boy when
he stepped onto the float jack mead and
black river watched him curiously from
their after deck nodded when he waved
enthusiastically

  i dont see any wrinkles in his face
yet  ben remarked and jack strode off

  when the okisollo had pulled away a
white jacketed steward came onto the float
from the viking

  captain jensen would appreciate the
honor of your presence at tea sir he said
formally to j j

  b jiminy yes come aboard jensen
called expansively from the viking before
j j could reply and bring your grand-
father and his friend too

  he nourished a cigar as he strode to the
rail there seemed to be more gold braid
than ever  his coat and his ornate yachts-
mans cap was set at a rakish angle

  ill be glad to come j j called gen-
ially a few things to attend to and ill
be aboard

  lrorn his foreman he learned that while
the viking had been there since morning
jensen had neither come ashore nor seemed
aware that he was tied up at the float of his
former camp at noon when the men had
come down for dinner he had paced and
posed the length of the viking occa-
sionally he bellowed an order but never

once did he look toward shore

  most of the morning sam creer re-
ported he set out at the back end there
under the tent business drinking tea any-
how i guessed it was tea twice i heard
him holler for the flunky to bring him
some

  on board the cleopatra j j received a
more detailed and also more inflamma-
tory report of the activities aboard the
viking while they practiced only the es-
sentials there was nothing in yachting eti-
quette jack and ben did not know it was
a condition they had set for themselves
when they had started out to keep pace
with j j and their flat refusal to be seen
on such a ship reached heights of lumber-
jack oratory j js eyes twinkled

  there isnt anyone we know in the se-
attle or vancouver yacht clubs who
wouldnt pay a price for a chance to watch
this fellow at close range he said i
never saw weber and fields but i know
they couldnt put on a show like this

  he won them over despite their grief
over the degeneration of the viking and a
few minutes later the three walked out
onto the float

  b jiminy come aboard gentlemen

jensen cried ef-
fusively as he
met the m
grand day for
yachting isnt
it

 jack mead
glare d bens
eyes twinkled
and j j in his
best manner introduced the vikings
owner

  glad to meet you jensen said when
he shook old jacks limp hand  heard
about you down in washington i live in
the states myself logged down there
too that your yacht

  its my boat jack answered

  tidy little thing i ban looking at her
but  not see any crew

  and you wont-aboard the cleopatra
well i like a good crew myself when
a man goes out yachting he goes for a rest
and how can you rest when you do all the
work me i yust say something and it
ban done steward

  the last was a bellow and the white
jacketed figure appeared almost immedi-
ately

  tea on the back end and get a
wiggle on	

  he led the way aft ben punching j j-

                                                        
r

his own logs

in the ribs jack still glowering jensen
tated them with a flourish passed a box
of cigars

  a tray appeared and a plate of small bis-
cuits the steward poured tea in j js
after dinner coffee cups bearing the mono-
gram of the seattle yacht club ben and
i j accepted theirs jack only shrugged
his shoulders and grunted

  ive drunk a good many things aboard
the viking but never tea between meals
he burst forth at last when jensens talk
ceased for a moment

  b jiminy i hate that slop myself
jensen exclaimed but when youse ban
in rome you got to do it steward

  they drank scotch three of them a bot-
tle of it as the afternoon slipped by j j
had his customary charged water after the
first glass and after steering the conversa-
tion for bens delectation for a time he
lapsed into silence they were well into
the second bottle and jensens speech was
becoming a little uncertain when the young
man took advantage of a lull

  jensen he said quietly did you for-
get all about that ten thousand dollar mort-
gage when we made our trade

  the vikings owner stared with open
mouth and thenhe laughed

 b jiminy forget it  he cried that
lan a gute one nobody ever see me for-
et ten thousand dollars

  then you must have forgotten to speak
  out it

despite his liquor jensens mind was in
ir working order he examined the
ooth untroubled and unangered face
jacross the table and found it very innocent
d very boyish

 that ban another gute one he
 ughed that ban yust what i ban going
 say i yust forget to tell you and
 fterward when i think about it i say
 h what ban ten thousand dollars to mr
 lead and i forget it again

 i knew it must be something like that

j j said brightly and without looking to-
ward the amazed faces of jack and ben
 and so long as you forgot to mention it
ruppose we drink a toast to the departed
bor i guess thats what the ten thousand is
blow its about time for me to have an-
ptfier

i craft had dulled the effects of the whisky
   jensen liad ijeen watching j j closely
   he spoke but with the last words and
  he guilelessness of the boyish face he was
  issured

  b jiminy that ban another gute one

   cried we drink to the departed 

   



  a little later jack and ben went back to
the cleopatra j j remained took the
chair next to jensen talked boats cruising
motors jensen beamed became more ex-
pansive ordered another bottle

  of course you stopped at the vancou-
ver yacht club on your way up j j
said

  well you see i not have time to join
a yacht club down in seattle and my skip-
per he tell me i got to belong if i go visit-
ing other clubs

  oh thats too bad there are a lot of
good fellows down there and they would
have been more than glad to have you take
a visitors berth

  then i ban dont have to be a member
of a yacht club jensen asked eagerly

  its the thing to do but if i were there
-id be glad to introduce you- and j j
frowned speculatively

  ven you ban going to vancouver

  i ought to be there now but the okis-
ollo-

  b jiminy dont you worry i take you
there right now hey captain get un-
hooked and pull out we ban going to
vancouver me and mr mead

chapter v

the fighter

a

t midnight the viking tied up at
the float in pender harbor and was
away again at seven but not before
j j had left a message for transmission
over the government telegraph at noon
she passed beneath the prospect point sig-
nal tower in first narrows and j j from
the pilothouse door saw the lookout read
the yachts name with his glasses and then
disappear a hundred yards beyond lie
knew their arrival would be known in the
city

  carl jensen in fresh white flannels his
gold lace shining stood in state on the af-
ter deck as they passed up coal harbor
and through the dredged channel to the
yacht club t- j- was in the pilothouse
giving the skipper the course but when
they approached the moorings he could
not resist the temptation to take the wheel
and the viking made her usual smart ar-

rival	a

  two men were standing on the float
and no sooner had bow and stern lines
been made fast than they climbed aboard
one was in uniform and as he approached
jensen the yacht owner arose with an ex-
pansive smile this could be no less 
short stories

tho commodore of the club come to extend

an ofticiaj welcome

  b jiminy gentlemen i ban glad to see
you he exclaimed wont you sit down
and have a cup of tea or a glass of

scotch 

  are you carl jensen the man in uni-
form asked sharply

  thats me

  owner of this yacht the viking

  yes and she ban one tine boat let me

show-

 represent his majesty the king and
i hereby serve notice on you that your

craft is libeled
in the sum of
fifteen thou-
sand dollars i
will give you
ten minutes in
which to re-
m o v e your
crew yoursel f
and your per-
sonal belong-
i n g s after
which no one is allowed aboard

  jensen gaped and blinked j j was
coming along the deck one hand reached
out and he gave the rail what was noth-
ing less- than an affectionate pat

  b jiminy mr mead you tell these
fallers they ban make mistake f jensen
cried they say i cant stay on my own
boat this an american boat and he
turned furiously on the man in uniform
your king got nothing to say about it

  your craft has been libeled by due
process of law was the even reply i
advise you to gel a solicitor meanwhile
it will be necessary for you to remove your-
self your personal belongings and your
crew

  but what you mean libeled cant a
man run his own yacht where he wants to
without having a king getting fresh mr
mead you tell em i buy the boat from
you

  the gentleman is entirely right jen-
sen j- j- answered you see libeled is
the marine term for attached if you put
tip the fifteen thousand dollars you can
have your boat

  you think im crazy i aint got it
and why should i pay anybody fifteen
thousand dollars 

  because your memory is poor and you
forgot to tell about a little matter of a ten
thousand dollar mortgage when you traded
your logging outfit for the viking as
soon as that is settled you will have iio dif-

ficulty in getting your loat hack again
it was some time before jensen caltm
down enough to leave the viking but 
was no sooner on the float than his ctv
demanded their wages j j and ta
bert his lawyer departed for the city wht
the seattle man was listening to ne
threats of libel

  can you rush things through j
asked as soon as the lawyer started h
car

  as fast as the court will act we-
got a good case didnt the darned fo
know he shouldnt have brought that bo
back into british columbia waters
all he knows about a yacht is having
tea table on the after deck and he cat
raise tliat money can he

   my report from seattle is that he hast
much cash but considerable real estate
his wifes name

  the way ive sized him up be wot
touch tliat j j said got somebody
buy in the viking

  i know half a dozen men wholl ta
that chance to make a couple of thousai
and play square with you boy and t
bert glanced at the youthful face beside h
with admiration tinged bv awe i hand
to you if at your age you can eat yo
cake and have it too i want to see y
work ten years from now

  its sort of rough on jensen j i
said quietly but maybe itll be a lesson t
him anyhow he was a yachtsman for
week

   youre a grand little moralist  talbtl
scoffed

   i cant afford to have anyone think ii
easy besides i havent had a nibble j
this cake vet a lot of that three mi hi i
feet is still standing on a mountain ail
its got to be in vancouver before i gt
any cash

  it seems to me youre justified in g
ing to your father or your grandfather f j
a loan youre sound can pull out with
good profit

  tve never asked for a tow yet it
make port

  oh i know how you feel about j
you just jumped into a bad situation b
with the mead lumber company behir
you- and he waved his hand

  they werent behind me when i juinpe
in and im not playing the game th
way j j answered in a tone tliat d
missed the subject you can drop me o
anywhere along here i want to scot
around for a tug going up the coast
he found one and forty-eight hours aij
his own logs

ter me had left his camp he was back again

   the cleopatra was not there and creer
 could not tell him where it had gone

   they just pulled out that night he re-
 ported never said a word

   probably after salmon j j said and
 immediately he was immersed in reports of
 what had been done in his absence

   the crew he found was keeping up its
 pace a rivalry had developed between
 two donkeys the fallers and buckets
 were comfortably in advance of the en-
 gines and the big machine at the head of
 tlie skidway was handling the logs as fast
 as they came within reach of its long ca-
 ble

   but j j was well aware that such effi-
 ciency in the camp did not spell success it
 was essential but other things could wreck
 him

   jensens note for ioooo secured by the
 lachinery and equipment was due august
  after his talk with the cashier of the
 bank he knew there could be no hope of

 	extension that must be paid or he
 ould be foreclosed the viking was
 ibeled but the case might not come to
 ial in time he could not depend  it

   jensen had delivered  feet of
 gs and  had been put in the water
 ince j j took over the camp with no
 ious breakdowns and the crew maintain-
 g its present rate he could get the re-
 aining two million feet into the water and

                      his sections



test of seamanship now he saw only dis-
aster in a freshening wind

  it could not be risked so short a time
even in august and he could not afford any
more risks than he had for j j knew
t i this one job this one lot of three
million feet the existence of his small out-
fit he read everything each days prog-
ress each contingency in terms of the fu-
ture in strides toward an ultimate goal
and m that light he could not fail

  for several days he took no action nor
did he go to work again on the logs in the
boom as he had the first week instead
he spent all his time on the mountainside
watching the operation looking over the
uncut timber and planning how best to get
it to water at the end of the fourth day
he went to rock bay across johnstone
strait and sent a telegram to his lawyer

  rent a donkey on skids and hire a
crew fallers and buckers send them
quick by tug

                          made up ready
                          for towing in
                          six weeks

                         a glance at
                       the calendar
                       showed that
                       this left less
                       than a week in
                       which t o tow
                       the logs to
                       vancouver col-
                       his money and go to the bank

 j j whistled and his smooth face puck-
 ed in a frown the yucluetaws rapids
 and then  sea miles in the gulf of
 fceorgia he knew every inch of that wa-
  rway had seen log booms held up for
 bays at the ragged islands behind grief
 joint in pender harbor
 b very often it offered marvelous cruis-
 that long narrow gulf of georgia
 d very frequently with a big tide and a
 ff breeze it could kick up a sea that
 ould pop logs out of a boom as one would
 e matches out of a box once j j
 the viking had welcomed a gale as a
 

  on his way back in the gas boat which
had been part of the camp equipment j j
grinned at the thought of the load he was
laying on talberts shoulders he had put
the anxiety of terms and payment up to the
lawyer and once the donkey was on the job
it couldnt be taken away until it had
served its purpose

  but he had little time or energy to give
to talberts problem his back was to the
wall and he had to have that donkey those
three million feet must reach vancouver
if he were to meet his obligations and con-
tinue operations talbert had let him in
for this present difficulty and could help
stand the burden

a

week later the cleopatra ap-
peared as she approached the float
jack mead in the pilothouse saw the
steam plumes of four donkeys on the
mountainside black river ben from the
engine-room hatch also saw and came for-
ward

  j js growing he commented

  hell be outgrowing his pants first thing
he knows the old lumberman growled

  they tied up and stepped onto the float
j j was not in sight and sing john in
answer to a question merely waved to-
ward the mountain

  ben walked ashore and for a time stood
watching the logs as they shot down into
the sea after a while he climbed to tlie
skyline donkey where he found a seat on
a stump in a few minutes j j appeared
short stories

 

  things is moving fairly fast black
river commented at last

  theyve got to j j answered his
tone was sharp and a little hard and a lit-
tle strained

  ben glanced at him quickly then away
that note jensen hung on you lie asked

  in a way hut it would liave been just
the same without it this thing-its got
to go over big ben

  the old man started he had never
heard that note in j js voice before it
managed to convey the idea of strong but
repressed emotions the yearnings and eag-
erness and insistence of youth

  its queer about logging ben said
mention a logger and most people think
of a millionaire they dont know that
for every one that makes good theres
twenty that goes broke its a hard game
and a ftinny game it aint just a business
proposition the best business man in the
world couldnt make a logging outfit pay
just because he was a business man theres
something about it-well like being a fiddle
player i guess a loggers born just like
they say a poet is

  but just being born a logger doesnt
make one j j objected

  no and being born a poet dont make
a man one unless he learns to read and
write and how long or how short a lines
got to be

  hows he going to find out  and there
was a sudden insistence in j js question

   just try in i guess

  ben black had always occupied a place
of his own in j js heart both jack
mead and ben had been bis playmates the
mountains the forest the sea all had been
shared explored and adventured upon to-
gether

  from this experience rough old jack
strangely softened by contact with the
boys fresh eager mind had emerged in
the role of a conquering hero of the past
a man to be respected and worshipped

  but age had mellowed the quick wits and
the lightness of bon black river driver
into a rich philosophy and a keen perspec-
tive quality which j j had instinctively
recognized as a boy and had learned to de-
pend upon in his youth ben had been the
recipient of confidences which j j would
never have dreamed of sharing with his
father or grandfather

  thats what im doing-trying j j
said at last there wasnt any chance
down there in washington and oregon
it was like going swimming all bundled up
in life preservers

  or hunting bears in a zoo

  it was not necessary for j j to e
plain more he knew ben under sto
perfectly but there was one thing th
ben did not know j j believed

  besides the young mail said at las
theres more than that to this busiues
the mead lumber company is establishes
it runs in grooves and id be just a k
learning to do business its way

  you mean about shipping your luml
in your own ships ben asked

  j j glanced up sharply for he was it
prepared for this understanding of 
dream if the mead lumber compai
is going on its got to carry its own pro
ucts to the consumer he exclaim
other big companies do look wb
happened during the boom in southe
california we lost out on a lot of bus
ness liecause we couldnt get the carriei
ive talked to dad about it hes n
afraid of salt water he just doesnt knci
it has a distrust of something new bl
weve got to come to it

  ben considered this in silence

  look at our markets in the east j
continued dads built up a faith in t
mead lumber and mead grading wii

our own shl
we could g
that prodt i
there regular j
d e p e n d a
ly and at d
minimum t
cost

 and yc
figure that yj
couldnt go
there now a
make yot
ideas stick
ben suggested

  not now but later and there was tj
triumphant conviction of youth in j j
tone dont you see ben ive got
put this over to make good with myself ai
then with him

  there was a passion in his voice ben be
never heard before and the old mans mit
turned back to that winter camp on tli
swift when jerry had battled so fierce
to prove himself in his fathers eyes 
a long time neither spoke

  ben finally broke the silence with
question how long you figurin on
five years was the prompt answer
in bc

  of course im incorporated now th
mead logging and towing company 
his own logs

    towing ben repeated in surprise
 you bet before im through im go-
 ng to tow my own logs to my own mill in
 vancouver im going to tow other mens
 gs and im going to tow them differently
 than they were ever towed before and
 from places where they havent been able

o	tow successfully im going over to
ie west coast of vancouver island and
up above cape caution im going to get
ogs from places where there isnt an ax
mark now because no one thinks its pos-
sible to get logs out

  j j had risen and was standing before
 ben his hands clenched his smooth face
 suddenly and strangely lined and creased
 lis eyes burning ive got to do all that
 le cried tensely ive got to make my
 dad come to me

  ben shook his head not from doubt but

o	whip away the drops of moisture that
lad appeared so quickly on his lashes and
then he grinned

  whats the matter j j demanded

 my minds wanderin i guess ben
explained lamely i was just thinkin of
something that happened back in wiscon-
sin one winter before you were born

chapter vi

a stab in the back

it here is no business like logging
and the manner in which it has been
ijl conducted at various times and in
various places raises a justifiable doubt as
jp whether it always remains strictly a busi-
less

  on a big scale with great companies and
 extensive holdings it is of course a sound
 established industry yet as in any en-
 terprise which depends upon the natural
 esources of a land there is always the op-
 rtunity for the small man of small means
 fr tlie daring individual

  in many places gold mining has been
fcduced to a business undertaking com-
anies have big investments huge plants

ii	the benefits of modern science and
  et the prospector continues his lonely
  panderings the pocket miner grubs with
  ck and shovel and small companies with
  o-stamp mills struggle through to suc-
  ss or failure always there must be
  ilh and optimism

  logs and gold liave much the same ef-
  t upon men the solitary cruiser
  rches for new timber lands the hand
  er works alone the small operator
  in with one or two donkeys and a
   w and always there is bright faith in
  hi



success great fortunes have been pyra-
mided and every man with a few dollars
and a donkey believes he can do the same
though he sees wrecks piled high on either
side of his path

   it is much like raising chickens or find-
ing ore that runs so many ounces to the
ton on paper it works out beautifully
a tract of timoer has cruised so many mil-
lion feet the cost of operation will be so
and so the rest is profit it has been done
a thousand tunes is still being done and we
get boards with which to build our houses
today because the logger is a first cousin
to the gold miner because he has faith in
himself and an ultimate fortune

  john jeremiah mead was born with the
entrancing odor of newly sawed lumber in
his nostrils grew up sniffing the sweet
aroma of a tree crashing before the ax
he knew logs and loggers in tlie few
years he had spent cruising along the de-
ligntfully broken british columbia coast
he had visited countless hand loggers and
camps great and small he knew their
woes and their opportunities saw them fall
and rise to success

  his own undertaking had not been an
impulsive affair for two years the idea
had been simmering in his mind and he had
been constantly on the lookout for an op-
portunity

   his logger blood was richly charged with
the loggers faith and optimism but the
two generations of success behind him had
laid a solid deposit of shrewd cool wisdom
and he had used it it was carl jensens
trickery alone that brought him face to face
with a crisis

  and as he sat in his office a few days
after his talk with black river ben he saw
that he faced defeat he knew that a word
to his father or grandfather and he could
pull through but complete failure was far
sweeter than any plea to them if he won
he was going to win alone

  he had been saving his allowance for
many months he had sold his motor car
had borrowed from his lawyer and with
this cash he had kept going meeting his
payroll and paying enough on his supply
bills to satisfy his creditors

he had counted on meeting the present
crisis by borrowing using his equipment
as collateral jensens mortgage prevented
i hat it was true that by catching jensen
british columbia waters and libeling

in

the viking he was in a position not only to
regain the lost  but the yacht as
well but he had just received a letter from
talbert that jensen had employed an at-
short stories

 

tonicy had obtained a delay and that the
case could not be brought to trial before
the note fell due

it was a bitter pill for youth for
liigh hopes and a most commendable
intention and for a mead from
early childhood j j liad been nourished 
the saga of the meads the meads had
always won had fought until success had
been compelled now he tinned and
twisted in his chair at the thought of his
own ignominy yet always his-mind turned
back to the weekly payroll that must le met
 saturday night and the meager balance
tliat would be left

  as j j sat there he suddenly became
very still ami tense the jjayroll  al-
ways his thoughts had brought him to that
in the remaining three weeks he could hold
off his creditors in vancouver hut the
men less than a million feet to go nine
working days and
the logs would be in
the water there
was a margin of ten
days in which to get
them to vancouver
five thousand dol-
lars a  d he could
win

  he had to borrow
it and there was 
security a hanker
would laugh at him
he had no collateral
and the men must be
paid the men
nothing on which to
borrow

  for a long time
j j did not move it was saturday af-
ternoon the hours were slipping mon-
day morning there would lje no white
piutnes on the mountainside no tooting of
whistles no geysers at the skidway but
when at last he totaled up the time book
and began to make out checks it was with
sudden impetuosity with a certain elation

  supper was eaten in the usual silence but
when the first man finished and started to
leave j j looked up just a moment
please he said i want to talk to you
fellows a minute when were all through

  the man sat down there were glances
of inquiry  he silence now seemed op-
pressive

  at last j j arose he had dreaded that
moment for never in his lifehad he made
a speech or talked to a group half so large
but now that it had come he found himself

curiously unimpressed by the srares
nearly fifty men and ly the frank challen
he read in so many eyes something el-
some force i tad complete possession
him

  he laid a bundle of time checks on t
table and then one foot on his chair
elbow on his knee he began to talk

  he told them first how he had purcha
the camp and the contract to cut the timb
gave the terms of die contract and then t
plained how with what little capital he fc
and what he could borrow on the equ
meat he had been assured of carryi
through successfully until the fust th
million feet were in vancouver

  j j grinned when he told how both
and his lawyer had been deceived by j
sen how the mortgage prevented his b
rowing as he had exacted and some
the men grinned hack at him

  here j j said as lie picked up 
bundle of paper from the table are 
time checks for each one of you paying j
all work done to this moment thi
checks are perfectly good at my bank til
is money there to meet them

  but and the easy maimer and t
vanished and his voice became hard 
have a balance of less than two hund 
dollars when these checkes are cashed 
enough to pay you for mondays work j
i cant borrow a cent this ca
equipment is covered by a mortgage t
falls clue august twentieth no ban
would listen tome for a minute no bt
ness man would take a chance on lett
me have five thousand dollars lecause
wouldnt le business

  someone down the table laughed j
waited and then he said quietly beca
i know  cant get anywhere with a lan
or a business man im coming to you j
lows im going to ask you to loan me i
five thousand dollars i need until these lp
are delivered

  there was a note of incredulity in 
laughter which greeted this a few staii
curiously	jl

  i dont mean to put up thecash j
continued with a confidential grin wi
 m asking is that you let the pay days si a
until those logs are in vancouver i
told you exactly where i stand i can sh
my contract you can look over my boo
the moneys there in the salt chuck c
in those logs but i cant turn it into ca
to pay you fellows until the logs rea

 red quickly

 ith a laugh

im willing to pay through the nose
s the reply ive got to youre
y last chance ill pay you fellows ten
cent for the use of your money for
ee weeks

he waited a moment and when no one
-ke he continued i dont want you to
rik of that as a bonus im not offer-
 you one if you fellows turn me down
camps closed im through

erhaps it was because he had ut-
tered the words aloud for the first
time it may have been that he
denly realized a mead was making a last
pairing plea to a bunch of loggers
tever it was the effect upon j j was
ling

 his foot came down to the floor with a
 jmp the intent conversational manner
 shed both hands gripped the back
 the chair and he leaned forward eyes
 e his boyish face strangely hard im
 asking a favor of you he cried
 rsely i dont come in here begging
 your money ive made a straight
 osition to you and you can take it or
 ve it

and im not threatening you the
ps closed now unless you say other-
 thats a fact not a threat nor
i promising you anything except the in-
t on your money i f i keep on doing

 all i can tell you is this if you do as
 k you can bet your last cent that theres
 hing i wont do to protect you ive
 en over a rotten camp and made it pay
 far i can keqi on making it pay if i
 a chance

 j stopped abruptly and turned to the
at his back he opened it then
ted ill he in the office he said de-
what youll do and send someone over
f-ll me or ask any questions
hey heard him walking away heard his
 door open and close and no one

  a   - ick set gray haired
bucket aughed outright in the panic of
 back m wisconsin i was glad to work
tor my board and tobacco he said but
i never yet had a chance to work for wages
and interest

  he was an old-timer one of those sam
creer had rounded up but there were only
eight of them the others were of an-
other school of lumberjacks the coast
school men who earned twice as much in a
week as the old middle western lumber-
jack had earned in a month they were
fed as no workingmen in the world were
fed their dress in town gave no indica-
tion of their occupation even in their
reading they encountered philosophies and
beliefs which were unknown to their
predecessors

  and if they had missed the hardships of
the earlier days of the industry so too they
had missed the old-time attitude toward
their work the earlier loyalty to individual
employers the earlier pride in a calling
to them a job is a job judged dispassion-
ately on the merits of the working condi-
tions and the recompense calloused or
cynical justifiably or otherwise no senti-
mental plea no magnetized touch of leader-
ship could touch them easily

  it was such a group to which j j had
talked and he knew it the old days when
hell and high water jack had taken a
drive down swift river with sixty loyal
yelling fighting men behind him were gone

  fine chance to work for nothing for
tliree weeks one of them remarked

  ten per cent of nothing is what

  why dont he pawn his white pants

   willies off the yacht and now hes off
the logs

  aw give the kid a chance a bucker
growled he never asked anything of
you he made a proposition and told you
to take it or leave it

  and he got in some logs aths

added he ci

 have won
 through

 i f the
 square-
 head hadnt
 slipped one
 over on him 
 there was a
 laugh and sam
 creer stood up

theres one

thing he didnt tell you the omdrrex-
plaincd he trapped jensen mto gomg
to vancouver and he tied up his yaeht so


short stories

now he stands a good chance to get the
logging outfit and the yacht too

  he can have my three weeks pay a
young fellow cried jensen came up here
just to show off m front of us fellows that
worked for him and if hes been gypped
im with he kid

  theres something else he didnt tell
another remarked he said the only se-
curity we had was his word we can put
a lieu on those logs no matter who owns
them and he knows it

  yes you got to admit hes a square
shooter he didnt come no haby act

   worked for the mead lumber com-
pany down in washington and you cant
tell me his dad and his granddad are go-
ing to let him go under a donkey engine-
man said theres millions back of him
only he didnt tell us so one of the
old-timers remarked significantly

  they got the point and were silent
there had been an appeal in j js talk an
appeal they had not wished to admit any
man likes a game fighter and here they
knew was one

  in the moments of silence that followed
j js fate hung in the balance the
scoffing had not killed entirely the impres-
sion his speech had made the mead
name was powerful the idea of working

for nothing was disturbing and yet-

  aw let him have it a young fellow
scarcely older than j j exclaimed as he
anxse and stretched his arms who
wants some poker tonight

  they were on their feet half of them
talking

  sure let him play a while longer
anyhow he leaves us sundays off
you le santa claus sam and go climb
down his chimney

  jestingly disparagingly they hid their
real emotions the fact that they had been
touched by a game kid with his back to the
wall and trooped out to the bunkhouses
 sam creer knocked at the office door and
was told to enter j j sat at his rough
desk a little white but his eyes steady

  theyll go you sam said and went
-out

  he was a wise old man and he knew that
moment was the youths alone he had
turned before he could see the quick blur
that came to j js eyes

th e only indication of an emotional
reaction on he part of the crew came
monday morning when the logs
seemed to shoot into the salt chuck with
more rapidity and frequency the whistles

to toot more cheerfully and insistently t
great fir trees to crash with an added ii
petus from the fallers a camp was telh
j j it was lehind him

  three days later he was assured tliat t
logs would be ready on the date set and
had one o the men take him over to joh
stone strait in the gas boat there
caught a steamer for vancouver

  he had already made arrangements 
a tug there was one that lie wanted t
largest in the harbor not only lecause
needed a powerful tow boat to take c
sixty sections but because the company h
the reputation of seldom losing a log

  he could have telegraphed but he coi
not afford to take cliances those c
had to go out

  two days after he departed the cu
patra came around tlie point and slid up
the camp there was the usual met
lous mooring and then when j j did i
appear jack and ben sought sing joh
he go town get tug the cook 
nounced he cotne back okisollo
thats day after tomorrow ben ssi
hes sure got some logs in that boom
pletty close sixty section next wi
nesday sing john announced proudly
jack mead looked sharply at the chi 
man and then up tlie mountainside
mg in he had been quick to sense the i
tivity there was even more snap in a
work than when he had last visited a
camp

  he walked away up the slope and afl
a little while he found sam creer ti
old wisconsin lumberjacks eyes wj
bright and his movements quick jsl
saw it and talked of a big salmon he 
caught then skilfully slowly he worll
around to the matter he had in mind  i
some git up and go to this crew i
remarked

  the logs are moving sam concede
and then he added with sudden enthusiais
first time i ever heard of such a thi a
he talked to em like he was doing em
favor and they took it that lad ijr
mead-well hes a mead if ever there vl
one

  what you talking about jl
growled

  sam told the story and told it well fi
the drama of it had moved him perili
more than the others

  jack listened in silence and without s
change of expression huh he grunlt
at the end he must have hypnoti
em bunch of damned fools

  he strode away down to the water a 

i
           his own logs
the cleopatra where he

climbed aboard

poured himself a large drink he grin-
ned while he downed it and he continued
to grin until he heard the men come down
to dinner a little later he went out onto
the float

  singly and in groups the members of the
crew were leaving the cookhouse rolling
cigarettes filling pipes talking jack
watched them measured them and when
a few minutes later he spoke to one on
shore he felt certain he had chosen well

  my names mead jack mead he be-
gan abruptly i understand you lads have
got the idea the mead lumber company
is backing this outfit i dont want you to
make any mistakes or come to us for any
money so im telling you right now that
the mead company and nobody connected
with it is putting a cent into this camp or
will stand any losses

  the fellow mumbled something in sur-
prise stared and jack walked away
aboard the cleopatra he aroused ben from
a nap

  lets get out of here he suggested
were most out of liquor and wed better
be heading vancouver way

chapter vii

the strike breaker

in contrast with his worries at
the camp j j had encouraging news
in vancouver

  jensen was going to delay things so
that we might be fighting that case all win-
ter talbert told him he was mad and
he got a good lawyer i saw things were
going to be tied up so i took another
tack

criminal prosecution j j asked

  no though there was grounds for it
and were charging fraudulent intent in li-
beling the viking but there are other
means of winning a suit i just tipped
things off to the newspaper boys

  what do you mean j j asked

  you know yourself it was a good story
son of millionaire lumberman trades yacht
for logging outfit because he wants to go to
work logger has always had ambition to
own a yacht sit on the after deck and drink
tea they trade yachtsman goes to
work logger goes yachting

  why boy we even got pictures of the
viking all decked out the way he had it
and a description of his triumphal cruise
up the coast visiting all his old logging
friends

  you can imagine what the papers did

   



seattle

they ate it up first page jensen was
interviewed told all about the joys of cruis-
ing and then when it came out you
should have heard him he left town in
disgust

of course both you and jensen being
men the seattle papers hopped
right to it their
camera men met
h i m-he still
wore his yacht-
ing clothes-and
they guyed him
unmercifully

 that was
three days ago
yesterday jen-
sens attorney
told me he is through through with the
viking with yachting and with british
columbia he never wants to see any of
the three again or hear anything of them
when the case comes up therell be no op-
position the viking will be sold to satisfy
your claim somebody buys it in for you
and there you are eating your cake and
having it too

  before august twentieth j j de-
manded quickly

  sorry boy thats the one place where
i fall down the judge of that court is
away on his vacation and wont be back
ive tried every way but there is no
chance

  well j j grinned im going to get
my logs down here in time anyhow now
im going over to see the man who owns
them and make sure he has the money
ready

  the owner of the timber which j j was
cutting had driven a hard bargain with jen-
sen because he wanted to insure quick
work he needed money and that money
depended on getting the logs to vancouver

as quickly as possible

  j j received a cordial welcome  ne

timber owner had read the papers j- j- s
own success meant that the logs would be
delivered a month earlier than he had ex-

 we wont wait for a scale he said
lensen delivered  feet you bring
down fifty-five sections and the minute the
tug puts thtm inside the mill boom  pay

you for three million

  thats fine j j grinned you see
i may have to hustle to get to the

  that note eh the lumbernam
laughed from what i ve read in the pa
pers i guess youll make
youncr fellow ive got ten

 it and say
 million more
i	short stories

up there im goiug to cut this fall want
it

  ill need money j j answered
promptly no more of this three million

before the pay starts

  sure ill be in better shape by then
and we can fix that ill have a contract
ready next time youre down

  in the office of the towing company
t j went at once to the owner wheres
the neptune he asked

  passed powell river this morning with
a tow

  thats fine shell just be able to make
it next thursday whos on her star-

rat 

  yes iiow much you going to have

  between fifty-five and sixty sections
j j answered and theyve got to be
here quick as steam can bring them

  dont worry ive been ready for you
the neptunes got to take fifty-five or
sixty sections to make money and were
glad to have em all in one place ill shoot
her out of here as soon as she gets in

  never even in a regatta had j j known
the elation of that day in vancouver he
was winning winning all along the line
he had overcome one obstacle after an-
other only victory could result

  there is nothing in the world quite like
it youth feeling its strength reaching out
clutching lifes prizes testing and proving
itself as j j walked down the street
he wondered how he liad ever found any
zest in racing for a silver cup when there
were so many worth while things to strug-
gle for

  his elation was not lessened even when
he went to the bank and discovered that his
note had been disposed of

   quite naturally we did so when we
had a good offer the cashier told him
we dont care to take over any more log-
ging outfits than we can help

  you would have been paid  j- j- re-
torted angrily my boom will le here

  the banker smiled good naturedly my
boy he said it is a daily occurrence in
this city men waiting for a boom i hear
it so often i sometimes wonder how their
faith can persist

  my loora will get here

  i hope so

t he okisollo sailed the next morn-
ing j j was so confident he would
be able to meet the note he gave lit-
tle thought to the fact the bank no longer
held it but later in the day he began to
wonder why anyone should wish to have it

in his possession at last he went to the
attorneys who he liad been told now held
the note when he sent in his card he was
received by the head of the firm

   want to know for whom you pur-
chased a note for ten thousand dollars se-
cured by the property of the mead log-
ging and towing company he demanded
abruptly

  the lawyer was a suave old gentleman
with sideburns my dear young man
he said that is a question i cannot answer
we hold the note in the interests of a
client

  i know that but who is he j j per-
sisted

  we liave instructions not to divulge his
name

  but thats hardly fair what if i want

an extension

  all negotiations are to be conducted
through us

  j j did not want an extension it had
become a matter of pride to meet that note
when it was due a goal in this new and en-
trancing game he was playing and he in-
tended to stand or fall on doing so but
lie was suspicious of the lawyer felt an in-
stinctive distrust of what lay back of the
purchase of the note

  very well he said how about my
getting thirty days more time

  i am afraid that is an impossibility
was the answer our instructions are to
foreclose immediately if the money is not
paid

  in a flash j j saw the answer jenen
had announced that he was through but
here he was striking back

  all ive got to say is that youre in a
pretty business he exclaimed ive
libeled your clients yacht because of fraud
on his part in connection with this note
he withheld knowledge of it when lie sold
his logging outfit by which it is secured

  my dear young man the lawyer pro-
tested i am sure you err

  i dont err and i wont youll find me
at the vancouver hotel on august twen-
tieth see that youre there with the note

  later going back on the okisollo j j
laughed when he thought of the shocked
expression on the old gentlemans face
but he did not laugh when he thought of
jensen as never before he determined
that he was going to win through for the
first time the personal element entered the
situation there was someone he wanted
to humble

  as the okisollo approached his camp
j j went below to get his bag and it was
p

not until they were warping in to the
float that he saw there were no logs shoot-
ing down the skidway no exhaust steam
from the donkey engines on the mountain-
side that a number of the crew were wait-
ing their baggage at their feet to take the

steamship

  the okisollo
was still ten feet
from the float
when j j took a
running leap
from the lower
deck cargo doors
and landed
squarely in front
of his departing
workmen

  where are you going he demanded

  none answered they had not expected
his volcanic landing

   why arent you at work j j insisted

   were quitting one of them said sul-
lenly

  the okisollo was tied up now the re-
mainder of the crew had come from the
bunkhouses j j looked at them he
was beside himself with rage he took a
step forward and his fists were clenched

  wrhats the matter with you fellows
he asked hoarsely

   again no one spoke

  afraid to speak eh youre a bunch
of quitters a bunch of welchers your
words not worth the breath its spoken
with you told me youd stick and i be-
lieved you you work a week and now
when we might have won out you bunch
it

   dont get too fresh young fellow a
big faller grumbled i wont stand for
those names

   youll stand for that and more because
any man wholl break his word go back on
someone whos in a hole hasnt guts enough
to resent being told exactly what he is

   youd a got a square deal if youd been
square with us someone called from the
back of the crowd

  j j leaped forward pushed his way
through to the speaker whose voice he had
recognized it was the man to whom old
jack mead had spoken a wood bucker
j named glover

  youre a liar glover he cried i
have been square with you

   you were not and glover while truc-
ulent in voice retreated a step there
aint no mead money back of you if
 youre broke youre broke and your father
nor your grandfather wont step in and help

    

his own logs



you out pay us what weve earned and
that s so i know it old jack mead told
me so himself

  it was the thing needed to break j js

rafe pe had lost contro of himself saw
only defeat and in that moment he did not
care what happened would gladly have at-
tacked the entire crew now it was his
turn to step back

   lie told you  j j repeated in aston-
ishment

  he whirled saw sing john in the cook-
house door was the cleopatra here
while i was gone he asked

  old jack n black livel they come
stay hour go away the chinaman an-
swered impassively

  j j whirled to face the crew tlie
mystery of his grandfathers act must wait
with a clear head he faced the crisis

  is there one of you fellows who ever
heard me say there was mead money be-
hind me that in case i went under it would
help me out  he demanded hotly

  a few shook their heads none an-
swered aloud but at the back of the
crowd several were walking away picking
up their baggage

  captain mackaye j j called to the
blue clad figure on the bridge above him
dont let one of these men aboard your
vessel for ten minutes and as a favor
will you hold your boat here that long
the skipper had been watching and lis-
tening and he was not entirely ignorant
of the situation moreover the nerve of
the youth had won his admiration

  keep those fellows ashore the cap-
tain bellowed down to his crew anil
leave those lines alone i ll tell you when
to cast off

   thanks captain j j said and again
he faced his men

  now he resumed that night i talked
to you when i asked you to let your wages
slide for three weeks did i say anything
about mead money being back of me about
it being used to help me out

  no one spoke and j j looked around
how about it matheson he de-
manded pointing at a man and you
fraser campbell tarr murray
did i give you the impression i had any-
thing back of me 

  purposely he had picked out the older
steadier men and he insisted that each an-
swer before going on to the next all
shook their heads emphatically though with

a bit of shame	

  you gave us a square talk and didn t
claim anything murray answered
 short stories
then why this fellow along and thanks for waii-

 

   all right j j retorted

the quitting

  because your grandfather let us know
it was the right thing for us to do an-
swered glover

  what did he say

  that he and your father and the mead
lumber company wouldnt stand any
losses and didnt have a cent in this camp

  and nobody ever claimed they did
j j retorted i told you i was going un-
der unless you fellows came through and
 would have won out if you hadnt been
a bunch of quitters and welchers

  thats enough of this talk the big
faller cried

  ill say it again j j shouted and
ill tell you something else there isnt
any mead money kick of this camp but
theres a mead running it and youll find
tliat out before youre through

  how about it someone called from
the crowd they say that back east no-
body worked for a mead unless a mead
had licked him does that go here too

  he was one of the crew who had come
in with the new donkey a loud talking hook
tender who voiced an opinion  every sub-
ject

  step out where i can see you when you
talk like that j j commanded and when
the crowd parted he walked up to the
man

  now he said you know and i know
that conditions are not the same here on
the coast as they were back in wisconsin
maybe my grandfather had to lick every
man on his crew and maybe he only
wanted to i wouldnt have a man in my
crew i had to lick

  so youre fired ive got a hundred
and eleven dollars left in the bank you
get your pay now take off your coat

  thats talking cried captain mack-
aye from the bridge and the score of pas-
sengers hanging over the rail most of them
loggers on their way to various camps let
out a cheer

  the man sensed that the crowd was not
with him and drew back but j j had an
excess of emotion that needed working
ot

  come on and see what a mead is like
he shouted and sprang forward

  it wasnt much of a fight the fellow
didnt get started or didnt try when he
fell down j j turned away in disgust he
went into the office wrote out a check and
gave it to the man

  all right captain he called take

mg 

the skipper
gave the word
lines were
thrown off and
t h e okisollo
drew slowly
away

now j j
said as he faced
his waiting
crew its eight
hours before dark you can get in a days
work

  the men laughed and turned away be-
fore noon logs were sliding into the chuck

chapter viii

a heart invincible

jerry mead gathered from an oc-
casional letter postmarked in some un-
known office up the british columbia
coast that j j was still cruising jerry
was very busy not only with the mead
lumber company itself but with plans for
the consolidation and he was away from
seattle much of the summer

  negotiations for the merger were prog-
ressing more rapidly than he had antici-
pated his entire attention was occupied by
it and it was with something of a jolt that
he read in a seattle paper tliat his son had
traded his yacht for a logging camp and
stood in a fair way not only to keep the
camp hut to get his yacht back as well

  jerrys inclination was to believe that it
was only a newspaper feature with no more
foundation than a joke on the part of some
of j js friends he forgot it until a
few days later when he received a telegram
from his father asking him to come to van-
couver jerry caught a night boat and was
registering at his hotel when jack mead
came up	tt

  no need of writing your name there
jack said bring your bags along

  whats up jerry asked when they
were in a taxi

  i dont know exactly hows the mer-
ger coming

  better than i had hoped were about
to draw up the final agreement

  huh pretty fast work whens it
go into effect

  immediately

  jack said nothing

  where are you taking me jerry in-
sisted i want to return tonight  

im taking you up the coast a ways

                                                         
his own logs

  but i cant jerry protested ive
got to get back this thing cant be put
off 

  old ack was silent for a while and
jerry saw that he was disturbed look
here lad the father blurted out at last
ive never asked much of you you and
ive always understood each other pretty
well weve hitched fine we never had
any doubts did we 

  no

  then dont have any now i havent
changed a bit

  jerrys instinctive protest died before the
realization of the unusual nature of this
request no ordinary circumstances could
have dictated it

  and there had been something in the old
mans manner and voice that was entirely
new it was a passionate insistence al-
most a plea was as close to an expression
of deep emotion as he had ever known old
hell and high water to come

  jerry was silent he did not wish to
go he ought not spare the time cut him-
self off from all communication with seat-
tle and yet he knew that here was some-
thing in which he could not fail his father

  all right he said at last but make
it as quick as you can

  characteristically jack made no com-
ment instead he began telling his son
of the cup the cleopatra had won and of
his and bens satisfaction in beating the
crack yachts of the northwest

  you mean that old tub of yours is the
fastest boat in seattle jerry demanded

  the surest jack answered it aint
a speed race they call it a reliability con-
test this year we run from seattle to
victoria just the finishing time is set
and every skipper figures out the speed of
his boat and tides and maybe wind and
he decides how long it will take him then
he starts so as to finish right on the dot-
if he can

  didnt j j win something like that
two years running hes a wizard at
it and he knows his boat bettern most
commercial skippers but this year he
wouldnt enter he went dangling off up
the coast and left ben and me to uphold
the honor of the family	

  and you and ben won eh

  just fifteen seconds off our estimated
time no other boat was within half an
hour its most eighty miles

  thats steady running

  its more than that jack exclaimed
with some heat its being absolutely
sure and mighty longheaded thats the

reason j j won twice and would have
won this year if he had entered

  nd that is all jack would tell about
f- j j until they were sailing north in
-mcalm channel the next afternoon
ben was below washing the luncheon
dishes jerry and his father were alone in
the pilothouse

  j js bought a logging camp and been
running it all summer jack announced
without any preliminary

  so thats what im up here for i saw
something in the papers but didnt believe
it

  its only a small part of the reason
jack said he traded the viking for
three donkeys a fine float camp complete
equipment and contract to cut six million
feet with half a million already delivered

  i understand jerry said coldly you
put him up to this it happened just after
i saw you in vancouver and you think
that-

  stop right there jack growled i
never knew it myself didnt know where
he was until i run into the viking with this
squarehead aboard so get that idea out
of your head ever since he started he
hasnt told me a thing about his business
what im going to tell you i learned my-
self

  but you influenced him you told him

i	was planning this merger intended to get
out of the business jerry insisted

  i did not and ill give you any odds he
doesnt know yet what youre up to hes
been- jack stopped and chuckled
hes been too busy to know theres any
other logging outfit in the world except his
own

  and you brought me up here to watch
him cut a little jag of logs like that six
millions nothing if his contracts all right
that doesnt alter my opinion j js not
a logger and he doesnt care about the busi-
ness that s what i didnt want to do
force him into any-

  force him jack interrupted i
guess the lads done all the forcing i told
you in vancouver what he needed-his own
logs and his own game and he found it
dont think anything you ever tackled at
his age was like this

  the fellow he made the trade with
slipped one over on the lad and his lawyer
hid out a mortgage had it filed after the
trade ten thousand dollars that
spoiled j js plan to borrow on the out-
fit

  worse than that he had a poor crew
  o

no git up and go and it didnt make
any better when he wore his white yacht

pants on the job

  jack seemed to be concentrating on hold-
ing the cleopatra to her course down a
perfectly clear and wide channel

  he fired half a dozen gave two of them
a good licking and in a week those three
donkeys were putting more logs into the
water than any three i ever saw before
he sold his car and then when he found
how jensen had tricked him he turned
round and libeled the viking he knew
maritime law and he didnt let that square-
head put anything over on him now it
looks like hes going to have liis camp and
boat too

  jerrys eyes had brightened but he
couldnt quite place the j j he knew in the
picture

  that was a clever trick he admitted
and then after a quick glance at his father
he added hes smart all right i never
said he wasnt but can he stand the
gaff

  jack walked to the rail and knocked the
ashes out of his pipe well he went flat
broke and then he got his crew to let wages
slide until he had delivered tlie logs lie
said when he returned to the wheel how
he did it i dont know theyre a differ-
ent breed than the lumberjacks i knew back
in wisconsin but he did it i guess
that ought to show you hes a mead we

always had our
men behind us
but this took
something dif-
ferent from just
leading a bunch
of hell raising
river pigs down
fast writer
jerry made no
effort to conceal
his pleasure for
he knew t h e
value of that
quality of lead-
ership which he
and his father
shared black
river ben came
up from below and stood in the pilothouse
door jerry looked thoughtfully over the
water for a while and then turned to his
father

  the lads got stuff i never said he
hadnt only hes playing a short game
like that reliability run you won how do
you know the thing will hold him

well ive given him a chance to quit
jack answered i bought up that note
and told the lawyers to foreclose if the
money wasnt paid and last week i drop-
ped in at the camp and dropped a hint that
the men couldnt count on any mead money
being behind j j and paying any wages
he couldnt

  you did whatf jerry demanded

  thats the rottenest trick  ever heard
of ben exploded furiously youre
getting too old to live if youre that mean
j j was havin tough enough sleddin and
he was getting by now with that why
he cant win out youll break the lads
heart thats what you will you- and
there followed a scorching flow of exple-
tives that only an old river pig could
achieve

  it wont break his heart if hes a mead
jack said coldly when tlie furious ben had
subsided

  it was brutal and it was heroic jerry
glanced down and saw his fathers knuckles
were white where they gripped the wheel
he had always known how jack worship-
ped his grandson how the boy had so
strangely softened the rough river driver
of a past generation and suddenly he com-
prehended how the old man had put his
faith to the test not because of any past
performance but because of pride in name
and blood

the cleopatra went steadily on and
there was silence in her pilothouse
they were abreast church house
with the yuduetaws opening ahead when
at last jerry spoke hows the boy stand
now  he asked

  if he held his crew the logs are in the
water and the sections made up the
neptune comes tomorrow to take em to
town the notes due the twentieth

  but this is the ninth jerry exclaimed
taking a boom of two and a half million
the length of the gulf of georgia he
hasnt a chance

  it can be done jack said and then
with a slight break in the voice that had
never faltered before if hes a mead

  they tied up at henrys that night to
wait for the high water slack in the morn-
ing but they did not fish for salmon in
the rapids instead three silent men sat
in the cleopatras main cabin and waited

  a dozen miles to the northwest j j sat
in his office also waiting but there was
 tension no expectancy his job was
done fifty-six sections of fir and cedar
logs were in the water sections of be-

                                                        

short stories
it
his own logs

tween forty-five and fifty thousand feet
each

  that afternoon the last hole had been
bored in a boomstick the last boom chain
dropped through the booming winch
had drawn the logs tightly together the
swifters were in place before noon the
neptune would come and she would have
ten days in which to get the logs to van-
couver one hundred and twenty-five sea
miles to the southeast

  j j was not tired youth derives
stimulation not exhaustion from a strug-
gle now as he sat there he was already
busy with the next job the ten million
feet he was to cut there was a pad of
paper before him a pencil in his hand and
he was dreaming the lumbermans dream
that is so curiously like the city mans
dream of a chicken ranch-so many hens
so many eggs per day so many chickens
at the end of the first year

  only j j had raised every chick and
he knew it everything except a forest
fire had risen up to balk him and he had
gone on

  five years he said to himself over and
over five years and dad will come to
me

  he sat back for the first time that
summer he found himself wishing for a
sight of the blunt bows of the cleopatra

it was a moment he would have liked to
share with his grandfather and with ben

he wanted them to know that some of the
fire and force that had made jack mead a
legendary hero had come down to him

  and he wanted too to hear his grand-
fathers reassurance that whatever remark
had caused the mutiny it had been due
wholly to a misconstruction of an innocent
statement there could be no other ex-
planation he had concluded of glovers
story

  the next day the neptune arrived just
before noon j j was apprised of her ap-
proach by a prolonged tooting from all
four donkeys but when he went out onto
the float he saw that the big tug was ap-
proaching slowly behind her was a boom
of logs

  to j j it meant only one thing that
captain starrat had picked up a hand log-
gers boom and would leave it while he took
j js logs to town the men came down
the mountain for dinner and the tug man-
euvered the boom into the bay and made it
fast

  j j was the first to leave the table and
as he went outside the tug was drawing
up to the float



  how about it starrat called from the
pilothouse your boom ready

  every log j j answered with a grin

  fifty-six sections

  fifty-six eh thats too much i
cant take more than forty-five of them

  what j j demanded incredulously
youve got to take em

  anything else was unthinkable fifty-
five sections had to be in vancouver or he
did not get his money

  i take what i have orders to take
starrat answered gruffly ive got fifteen
sections now and forty-five just make a
tow

  the men had been trooping out of the
cookhouse and heard and they were suf-
ficiently aware of the situation to catch the
full import but j j still could not be-
lieve

  look here starrat he said i was
in your office a few days ago and reed

promised me the
neptune would
take out my en-
 tire boom

  well i been
there since and
he told me t o
bring this other
stuff and take
what  could of
yours

  but my logs
have got to be there j j protested
reed knows that

  see here young fellow and starrat
leaned over the rail and looked down at
j j if i was to listen to the troubles of
every logger i tow booms for id feel as
if i was ninety years old all the time

  my logs are going j j stated em-
phatically

  sure ill take out forty-five sections
and in a week or so reed will send up a
small tug for the rest

  youll take them now

  there was a new note in j js voice and
the tug captain stared down at him curi-
ously there had been command in it not
a mere statement but the expression of a
will a purpose yet starrat only grinned

  tell you what son he said ou
fight this thing out with reed he s the
man to talk to im just doing what im
told by the man who pays me my wages
when you get your own towing company
you can give orders to tug captains but not
before

  it was said patronizingl and with an in-
solence which j j sensed had a purpose
i	short

behind it even the contemptuous refer-
ence to his own towing company was but
a reminder of the high dreams which had
been his only an hour before

  j j looked back where his own men
were grouped on the float victory had
been achieved the logs were ready not
only through his own efforts but by their
faith and trust they stood there watch-
ing waiting to see what he would do they
had kept their part of the compact

	remained for him to see that the logs
reached vancouver whether he was be-
ing thwarted by reeds duplicity or by the
boorishness of the tug captain it didnt
matter those logs all fifty-six sections
must start

  at once all the energy and determina-
tion the high purpose and ambition of the
summer were concentrated in the moment
and in the issue and in the person of cap-
tain starrat

  youre going to take my logs all of
them he said and youre going to leave
that other boom here those are your or-
ders and im giving them

  the captain laughed and spat signifi-
cantly over the rail grow some whis-
kers kid he answered before you talk to
grown men

  the tug had been made fast to the float
while they were talking and j j leaped
aboard and started along the port side to-
ward the bow starrat saw him coming
and ran down the steps there they met

  whiskers eh j j cried in a choked
voice any whiskers on this and he
let fly with his right

  starrat was nearly forty and heavier
and taller than j j and he had no mean
reputation on the vancouver waterfront as
a rough and ready fighter he laughed and
struck back when j js fist caught him on
the side of the head and j j went spin-
ning away

  come on kid and get another one the
captain taunted

  j j came with a rush his head down
both arms working and again he was sent
reeling against the bulwarks for an in-
stant he hung there a little dazed and
then charged forward again as furiously
as before

  only this time he suddenly stopped short
let starrat swing then leaped in when
they broke away after a furious exchange
of wild blows the tug captain was breath-
ing hard and there was a smear of blood on
his face

  with j js first rush his entire crew had
sprung to the side of the neptune and

stories

climbed over the rail to points of vantage

the tug boatmen too had run forward
the mate started to interfere only to find
a big logger in front of him

  the kid gets a show he was told

  sing john was there brandishing two
butcher knives and yelling strange shrill
words and when j j charged that second
time the cleopatra drew up to the tugs side
and jack and jerry mead and black river
ben stood on her deck and watched

  his face smeared with blood his clothes
torn his lungs heaving j j swept in to a
fresh assault for a time starrats skill
kept him away it was brutal the log-
gers cheered at the first few rushes but
when they saw their employer hurled back
time after time they became silent except
for muttered exclamations and an occa-
sional word of advice

  but j j did not hear nor did he see his
father and grandfather and black river
ben he was unaware even of the crowd
that had gathered that lined the bulwarks
of the neptune he knew only that he
faced defeat and that he could not lose
only that in the lug captain were personi-
fied all the deceit and opposition all the
troubles and woes of the summer and that
he must go down lie prostrate on the deck

  it was brutal and it was magnificent
bloody bruised staggered by heavy blows
without skill the youth continued to be the
aggressor there were times when it
seemed he could not go on when jerry and
jack mead gripped the cuopatras rail
with pressure whitened fingers when some
of j js crew began to mutter stop it

  but though bruised in body and dazed
in brain one clear undimmed light shone
before j js half closed eyes he must
win

  it was brutal and it was beautiful pure
courage kept him on his feet pure cour-
age sent him charging in pure courage
furnished the power behind the blows he
struck

  and not once liad starrat been shaken
from his position he still stood waiting
timing his blows confident he was
rather fat his occupation gave him slight
opportunity for exercise and his wind was
bad but j j had not shown anything to
disturb him he knew he had only to wait
keep cool pick his chances

  but j j had something starrat had
never before encountered it was a fight-
ing heart come down from the two men
who stood side by side on the cleopatras
deck a will and a purpose that never admits
defeat and as j j charged again and
his own logs

again and yet again as he was hurled hack
against tlie bulwarks only to leap forward
starrat began to be troubled he was
breathing heavily and this youngster who
should have been prostrate on the deck five

minutes before
was always com-
ing back

  with the cap-
tains wonder-
ment an idea
penetrated j js
rage enshrouded
mind he must
use his head not
waste himself so
his lungs were
bursting now his arms were becoming
leaden

  he charged twice more less furiously
starrat grinned the end was coming
and then j j advanced slowly arms still
he feinted ducked the heavy swing and
with all the fury of a terrier he charged
in head down both arms shooting straight
and hard into starrats mid-section

  the tug captain grunted and winced he
beat down at the head pressed against his
chest but was driven back a heel caught
a ring bolt in the deck and he tripped

  instantly j j became a thing possessed
of unleashed fury a raging battering burst
of passion not for an instant did he re-
linquish his advantage he did not know
starrat had tripped only believed he had
retreated and he kept him going back-
ward

  the loggers burst into a wild cheer
black river ben reached inside the pilot-
house and held down the cleopatras whis-
tle cord

  and in that din amid the shouts of men
who had reverted thousands of years j j
kept battling on crowding striking bor-
ing ceaselessly something told his white-
hot brain that body blows were effective
and he no longer reached for starrat s
face and he knew a wild sweet exulta-
tion as a fist sank into soft flesh

  the very fury of the struggle threw
them apart starrat gasping hands down
stared at his adversary

  youre a good kid he said i admit
it   

  swaying battered dazed still clinging to
the one thought j j charged again the
very ferocity of it toppled starrat over
anti he went down j j on top of him

  the young man was in a frenzy now
he grasped the captain by the throat beat
bis head on the deck



  do all my logs go out he demanded

today

  it was not the sobbing wail of a frenzied
youth but the hoarse insistence of a man
he relaxed his grip for an instant

  they do starrat squeaked

i

chapter ix

the house op mead

t was sing john who was first to
j js side when the young man arose
to his feet and staggered away from
starrat

  you come by kitchen he said as he put
an arm around his employers waist i
washum up

  but others were there the loggers
crowded around shouting hoarsely now
jack jerry and ben leaped at once to the
deck of the neptune and were struggling
to get through the crowd

  the mate of the tug ran up the steps to
the pilothouse and looked down from there
at the mob

  hey you loggers he cried its
one oclock get off this boat so we can
get busy we got to make slack at the yu-
cluetaws this afternoon

  old jack reached j js side there
were tears in his eyes and he was swearing
steadily and indiscriminately one of the
old mid-western lumberjacks saw him and
grinned

  say old-timer he cried ive heard
what they used to call you on the swift
but you lost your name now its passed
on theres hell and high water mead
and he pointed to j j

  thats the boy hell and high wa-
ter neither can stop him the loggers
cried youre a has-been old fellow
maybe jack retorted but i want to
tell you men that every dollar a mead owns
is behind this camp from now on get to
work

  the loggers whooped as they leaped onto
the float and streamed away captain
starrat was on his feet shaking off the
deckhands who supported him he strode
forward and confronted jack what you
let me in for he demanded angrily
you never said anything about this kid
being a cross between a wildcat and a bull-
dog i didnt know id have a fight like
this on my hands

  t did jack retorted and i knew
he could lick you

  well dont come around to me with any
i	short

more of your funny schemes play your

 own game after this

whats he mean jerry demanded

  mean that this old fossil came around
 to me with a plan to tie a knot in this kids

 logging starrat replied he said he had
 it fixed up with reed my boss but if he

didnt-

 theres nothing to fix up jack said
 go on and get these logs out

he turned and found j j confronting
him the boys eyes were nearly closed
blood smeared his face and his shirt was
in tatters

 and what vou told my crew he cried
 they nearly quit because of your med-
 dling why are you bucking me

 and that aint all black river ben in-
 terjected angrily he bought up that
 note on you lad and he was going to fore-
 close

 they faced each other grandfather and
 grandson staring straight into each others
 eyes the younger searchingly wonderingly
 the older with undisguised pride

 why j j began and then he started
 i see he said you wanted to find
 out-

find out nothing jack interrupted
with a growl i knew all the time you
never had to prove anything to me but

i didnt know-there was-

 he broke off uncertainly and turned to
 jerry j j looked around and saw his
 father for the first time

how did you ge here he demanded in
surprise

on the cleopatra

i see and j j looked understand-
ing from his father to his grandfather
you had to have proof eh i knew it
well im not ready to give it yet come
back in five years

 five years jerry repeated in bewil-
 derment

 in five years ill show you now im
 going ashore and wash up

sing john led him away and when they
were gone ben turned to the two meads
and laughed

 now you two bright boys he jeered

how you going to get out of that put
up a game on him will you test him
out eh hell why didnt you come
and ask me

stories

that afternoon the cleopatra went
south j j ignoring his torturing
body was at the wheel through the
yucluetaws an hour and a half before high
water slack jerry stood beside him in the
pilothouse and watched in silence until they
were through

  you can handle a boat boy he said
then

  i can handle ships j j retorted
quickly

  ships

   dont mean to navigate them i mean

to use them
hauling lumber
before i get
through im go-
ing to be run-
ning every end
of the game my-
self from tree
to retail lumber
 yard

  all the way
through calm
channel jerry
was silent at last he aroused himself

  where can i send some telegrams he
asked

  powell river is the nearest office will
be closed before we can get there but they
will go off in the morning

  i wish you would stop theres a lit-
tle deal i want to head off as soon as i
can

  he looked up to see his father standing
in the pilothouse door the old man was
grinning broadly

  and another thing jerry continued
when you get things cleaned up next
week i wish youd run down to seattle for
a day or two

  there was just a trace of deference in
the fathers voice that did not escape j j
and his heart leaped but he had deter-
mined to do certain things and j j was
not easily shaken in his purpose sorry
he said but id rather wait

  again jack looked at jerry and grinned

  i think jerry said slowly that any-
thing you ay will have just as much weight
today as five years from now

  which is how a yacht grew into a fleet of
lumber carriers that have the same house

by barry scobee
author of black sheep heavy money etc

       the deans were old-timers in the cattle country and bore an hon-
       ored name there so that was why young sam deans ma was de-
       termined that the name would never be associated with rustlers
       if she had to ride for an endless night to accomplish her purpose

the roly-poly detective knocked
imperatively on the siding of
the little unpainted shanty-
house about mid-afternoon and
mopped his nearly bald head
while he waited steps sounded on the
bare floor within the door was opened
and a big bony woman of a pioneer type
stern and unresponsive stood there

  mornin grunted the caller replacing
his hat miz nancy dean

  yes

 sam home

 sam her grim face relaxed and
brightened as if at a magic word no
suh my son aint in right now

  rwhere is he

  the query was brittle it wiped the
brightness from her face and set her
hard on guard her eyes lifted above the
mans big hat and searched out across the
dusty southwestern land toward the tree-
less town beside the railroad track wishing
that she might see sam coming then her
masked glance dropped back to the round
red face that in a way was as stern as her
own

  who are you she asked brittle as he

 names pink he turned back the
lapel of his vest oddly suggestive of pull-
ing his lip wrong side out in an impudent
grimace and displayed a bright star

     

  railroad detective he added

  come in she invited succinctly

  she closed the door behind to keep out
the blowing dust pink selected the rock-
ing chair and sat down with his hat on his
knees she sat down in a straight-back
and faced him

  now what you got to say for yourself 
she demanded

  nothing said pink sam where is
he

  i dont know hes been in no cussed-
ness if thats whats itchin ye

  how do you know maam without the
evidence didja hear about that half mile
o stock tram going into the ditch up lieah
day before yesterday afternoon

  got ears aint i  she whipped scorn-
fully instinctively opposed to this intruder
who was somehow against sam heard
the thunder when it piled up didnt i 
heard the bejlerin cows got eyes aint i 
seen the cattle and the riders going back
and forth didnt i and sam has been
working day and night at the wreck aint
he

  no said pink sotly and smiled

  nancy dean whitened under her sallow
tan at this inadvertent giving away of sam
but she pushed out in a quick attempt to
cover	fl

  hoooo mister you think i actually

r
short stories

meant working day and night dont you
do you think  dont know all about my

boy v

  pink declined to enter that discussion

and kept on

  two cars of that train load had un-
branded yearlings maam a few have
been rounded up some were killed and
crippled and their beef and hides have been
handled by the crew of salvagers the rail-
road company sent out but some fifty
or so are still missing

  well

  its been recalled maam-to speak
plain-that when sam was helping round
em up that first evening and get them to
the stockyards he kept cutting those un-
branded yearlings farther and farther to-
ward the fringe all the time till about dark
he had em worked out and throwed to-
wads the north-

  you saying sam stole them nancy
dean broke in harshly he didnt why
mister what on airth would he do with
them 

  cant imagine maam again pink
smiled with significance they say sam
has got a hard head and a strong back

  she did not fail to receive this by the
handle-that sam was all muscle and no
wit red spots appeared on her high cheek
bones and pink took warning and spoke
with more deference

  over in town miz dean they said
you was as honest as the day is long and
was striving to make a man outa sam i
expected you to cooperate at once in getting
the yearlings back before a warrant of
arrest was issued because the hoof prints
of the horse that followed those yearlings
zigzagging in behind and pushing them
along to the road where all tracks was lost
had the right fore shoe bent

  hoooo mrs dean derided in a long-
drawn shrillness what did he do with
them tell me that hid em maybe
under a rock or in a shadder of a cloud
or maybe behind his horse out there on the
flat

  she cackled in unbelievable scorn pink
flushed they got up moving toward the
door

  a dozen men are ready to swear that
sams right fore shoe was bent said pink
ill swear out the warrant

  mrs dean swung open the door for him
and he waddled through

  you go to the stock pens she advised
witheringly and like as not youll find
them yearlings in some pen there where
theyve been overlooked by you tenderfeet

  pink faced about and tried to fix her
with his glare

  madam he demanded you tell me
where that cow thief son o yours is

  i dont know where he is she flung
back this time without hesitation you
miseable snooping wretch youll prove
your words or i  sue that railroad o yours
skyhigh for slander sams done no
wrong

  she slammed the door in his face she
leaned her arms and head against the ianels
and sobbed with the dry racking of a wo-
man whose tears have all but dried up in
the grinding mill of human life but not
for long in a moment she was peering
from the window hardly seeing the angry
waddling figure of the detective in scan-
ning the dusty scape for her son

  sam had come home in the wee small
hours of the morning slept the forenoon
away and after dinner had gone to the
village-all of which nancy dean would
have told pink had he not become so
brusque there at first

  the sleuth had scarcely disappeared in
the maze when sam came cantering along
mrs dean went out to meet him at the
wire gate of the horse lot her skirts blow-
ing her face bleak and merciless

  where are they sam she sang out
without preliminary

  sam jerked around startled he was
big uncouth strong backed with a sand
complexion and stiff hair showing undei
his big western hat in contrast to th
sombrero he wore shoes instead of thi
cow country boots sam wasnt nothin a
his neighbors said

  where are they she repeated grimly
  what ma

  she did not weaken her position by ex-
planations she drilled at him with wint-
ery eyes and waited sams face vvenj
white under his round weathered cheek-
a family trait in high moments-and hi
wavered at last and turned to unsaddling
his horse nancy dean stooped and picked
up the bays right fore foot one prong oi
the shoe was bent nearly broken she
faced sam again with one dry aching sob

  where are they it was like the beal
of a fist	 

  sam strode to the house she on his heels
inside she unlocked a drawer in an old
chest and pulled out a quirt

  ive tanned your hide with this before
now she said ill dojt again even it
you are above votin age

 ma-

  she lashed out before he could evade
sams ma



the pliable leather hooked around his head
and left a streak on his right cheek

 ouch damn he cried dont

ma

  where are they

  he tried to seize the whip with sprawling
hands she succeeded in lashing him
twice more across the shoulders and neck
with all her might then he caught her
wrists hell was in his little slate eyes
he choked on his words he could not
strike or twist his mother-not quite he
walked her backward and sat her down on
the bed then he fled

  sam she shouted after him from the
threshold theyre getting out a warrant
for a cattle thief

 sam stopped he came back with re-
luctant dragging steps looking shriveled
and meek

  where are they  she panted unrelent-
ing

  sam looked at her his great wrestlers
shoulders against the door tliat he had
dosed behind him he moistened his lips
and swallowed

  hid he whispered in the hills four
miles south of here

  she studied him then slowly returned
the quirt pushing the drawer shut with
the side of her hip

 what was you aiming to do with
them she asked

 turn them to tonky jones-i wanted
money

  that cattle thief

  sam twirled his hat to a corner and
sulked to his cot in the little lean-to

  come night said his mother well go
get them and added if sheriff tweed
at got you in jail by then

  she told sam about the detective they

discussed the
subject at length
s a m realizing
more and more
the sore predica-
ment he had got
himself into it
came to nancy
dean with a
growing convic-
tion that for the
sake of wiping
lie slate clean they must accomplish noth-
ug less than getting the yearlings back to
wie stockyards-they must succeed in this

  o	save sam and keep the dean name clear
 she could not keep away from the win-
ow away from watching for the coming
f an officer with a warrant she arranged

pv      
    j 
   j y 
ingeniously to hide sam behind a curtain
against the wall where clothing was hung
out of the dust

  ill fool em she declared

  sometimes as she watched at the win-
dow she sat with arms folded a grim and
sorrowing figure sometimes she sewed
absently on a colored shirt for sam while
her expression clouded and cleared clouded
and cleared as she thought now of sam as
a toddler at her skirts and again as her
grown son in trouble she was afraid
afraid of the sheriff afraid because he was
of a newer generation and a comparative
newcomer in the cattle country he did
not know the deans their honorable record
as an old-time sheriff would know them
probably didnt care just a newer genera-
tion nancy dean shuddered once and
once she wiped away a starting tear but
never once did her stern old pioneer soul
weaken in sams behalf

  she prepared supper and when they had
eaten it was lamp lighting time but she
did not light a lamp sam went out to
remedy the bent shoe and saddle the horses
while she washed the dishes then she
donned old overalls and boots relics along
with the saddle that she would ride of the
days when she rode with her husband
handling the herds that he eventually lost

  it was just when she was ready to start
that the headlights of a car suddenly ap-
proached the house and stopped as a
rapping came on the front door she slipped
out by the back door and stole around to
where she could observe

  two men were between the headlights
and the house-sheriff tweed and frank
long his deputy

  nancy dean flitted across the horse lot
through the thick dusk to hurry sam at
the shed but the shed was empty sam
and the horses were gone from behind
the rickety door she watched the move-
ments at the house a flashlight was dart-
ing about inside-the officers making a

fore she knew it the men were almost to

the shed		

  chance of escape cut off mrs dean
jammed herself down in a corner of the
rear stall and in a moment the pocket light
was flashing from the doorway and tweed
spoke harshly

 horses gone	

  just got away-cookstove still hot
complained frank long if wed of got
back to town an hour sooner wed ot
clipped this warrant on sam and saved us
a lot or trouble like as not
short stories

  theyve gone to handle those yearl-
ings tweed was put out scatter them
to destroy the evidence against sam or
if the old womans in on the deal-

  she aint few minutes we was in
town a half dozen of the ol-timers collared
me said mis dean would he more likely
to make sam trot those yearlings back than
to be in on the deal with him poverty poor
as she is

  yeah the old-timers give me an ache
always trying to run things chief pink
told me theyd been feeding him that soup
all day he laughed at the idee said old
lady dean would do anything under gods
sun to protect tliat loafing sam of hers
theyll hide those yearlings deeper in the
hills or scatter em to the four winds
scatter them well put in a week rounding
them up and wed never get them all see-
ing theyre unbranded theyd mix in
with other herds

  a moment of silence then tweed spoke
more incisively

  frank im a mind to make a big try
tonight before the stuff can be moved far
or scattered deputize some of our good
friends with cars-the boysd call it a lark
-and go out and scrape the landscape with
the headlights and spotlights-every road
and back trail and hill and flat where cars
will travel wed be almost certain to find
that old woman and sam transferring the
bunch somewhere or else just going to it
catch sam red-handed or make him show
us the stuff make a case out of him two
three years inside would do that loafer good
anyhow few hours work tonight might
save us a week of hard labor

  youre right the deputy agreed in
case we should find them bringing the stuff
back to town whatll we do

  pinch sam if its in two hundred yards
of the stockpens hes got it coming the
bum these old-time families call me an
upstart and try to run things well just
show em they cant monkey with the buzz
saw lets go 

  i weed got away from the door and let
it swing to in six strides nancy dean
was there peering and listening when the
two men got half way to their car she eased
out into the night and went searching be-
yond the shed what had become of sam 
surely he was just out here waiting for her
and he was a short way off

  tweeds turning out the town against
us she panted as she stumbled up to him
weve got to get the yearlings in before
he finds us

  tweed-did he have a warrant

  a warrant-and contempt in his heart

for us old-timers and you

   lets ride

  they galloped east across the unfenced
alkali flat with the march wind against
their backs the woman astride her old
warped saddle that she had not been in for
ten years when they reached the north-
south road that came out from town sam
turned along it toward the town

  they couldnt track me after i got the
caves to this hard road he told his
mother riding close ill show you how
i took them

  he presently turned off to the left
obliquely toward the stockyards the
ground was cut up by hundreds of cattle
being shipped in the last two or three weeks
and no particular herd could be traced
anywhere within a quarter of a mile of the
yards

  i drifted them past the pens and across
the track way in the night when everbody t
was gone sam went on the stuff ir
the pens was bawling nobody could ol
told what i was doing

  you didnt gather them up and drive i
them by yourself said mrs dean cattle-
wise

  had a hobo from the wreck give hini
two dollars he thought the stuff wait
mine after we got back from hiding them
he went on his way slick idee sam cons
tinued with a touch of pride to crosii
them over the track and to the south hills i
tweedll be more likely to think i tool
them to the north hills

  slick idee replied mrs dean crush
ingly aint good sense when its criminali
reckon youre right ma

  on ahead at the stockyards they could
hear cattle bawling showing that not ah
had been shipped no lights were to bd
seen

  we better turn in and water thc
horses said sam they had no watesl
since morning	 i

  sam she warned somebody mighj
be there in the dark to see us	

  well horses got to drink aint theyf
they reined around the end of the pensr
moving cautiously to the circular meta 
trough beside the creaking windmill th 
night was as dark as a clear moonless nighi
could be sams horse finished drinkingfl
first and moved off mrs deans hace
just lifted its head and was mouthing wateij
when without warning a light flashed inf
her face	i

  excuse me mrs dean it was theii
station agent the light snapped offi

you-looking for somebody

 nol exactly she answered from a
throat constricted with alarm and she
blurted out the first words that came to
give sam time to get away theyre kind
of accusing my son of driving off some
yearlings and  told that detective feller
this afternoon that like as not a lot o
tenderfeet had overlooked the stuff heah
in the pens

  not a chance mrs dean it looks like
sam maam right sorry to hear it they
might make it purty hard for a-ahm you
know how it is mrs dean about cattle
stealing

  why was this man prowling around un-
der foot she suddenly asked herself was
somebody going to ship tonight and spoil
her plans of bringing the stolen goods
back 

  shipping tonight she asked at the
same time making her horse step about to
cover sounds sam might make

 no the agent answered no mo
cars till tomorrow and he added com-
plain ingly i came down here to shut off
this windmill fore it strips its gears got
no helper now then mrs dean where
is sam

  as when the detective had first put the
question nancy dean hesitated percep-
tibly then answered positively

i dont know	

i she did not know she assured herself-
he might be forty feet away or a hundred
yards

  she rode off toward the town until she-

was out of the
agents hearing
when she turned
south and pres-
ently found sam
out on the flat
they kept on
south to ascend-
ing ground and
a wire fence
which they fol-
lowed to the
road a gate let
the m through
into a great
ranch and they
headed south-

j four miles nearly said sam

 the west wind was high and cold it
tit at their faces pushed die breath down
their throats ice would form this night
or the first time sam showed compassion
for his mother



  youll freeze ma he said you
better go home ill do this

  no goin home till the yearlings are
back she retorted stubbornly though her
heart warmed at sams interest

  she wore an old knitted hood a sheep-
skin jacket that her husband had left
and yarn mittens but the glassy wind
penetrated to her very marrow

  as they mounted the gently rising
ground and rose higher than the town they
watched back over their shoulders and
after a time they saw the lights that began
to crawl over the country beyond the town
toward the north hills once nancy dean
brought up and while the horses humped
their rumps to the bitter gale she and sam
stared at the spectacle-seven or eight
glinting headlights scattered over the
country hurrying turning here and there
on little used back roads up the sides of
slopes there was something threatening
implacable about the widespread move-
ment and nancy dean turned to her son
with a new question born of her fears

  you sure them yearlings will be there-
couldnt get away or not lung

  theyre there answered sam in his
positive way nobody riding up in those
rocks to find them

  did honky jones know they were
there

  yep i told him

  theyll have to be there she said or
that upstart of a sheriff will send you up
they rode on mrs dean experienced
a bit of pride that sam had been shrewd
enough to cross the railroad and come to
the south hills otherwise they might now
be cornered over there by the cars

  they had made three of the four miles
when they were given a start by the snorts
and noises of stirring animals and they
saw they had come upon a handful 
horses sheltering in the lee of a rocky
upthrust on the open slope they stopped
to get a few breaths out of the wind and
view the moving lights against the opposite
slope only three or four were visible the
others no doubt having penetrated the hills
nancy dean thrust out her mittened hand
in an abrupt gesture

  the town jumps at ye the first chance
it gets she said its whatcomes of
your idling and never working	

  ive told j a and toldja id go to work
sam retorted hotly when i could find i
job where theahs a chance o pummolion

  them yearlings better be up there or yo
chances of pummotion will be mighty slim
come on

short stories

  they struck out again in a short time
a high rimrock began to take black shape
ahead sam kept straight on as if he meant
to ride into it the grade was stiffly up-
hill now

  caves are right at the foot of the rim

sam explained in snatches over the wind
in a bowl dug out by the water that pours
over from the mesa in the rainy season

  a shallow rocky canyon began to close
in on them until they were riding single
file then sam stopped

  i laid a rock wall across this neck to
keep the yearlings in he said as he got
down

  then he grunted queerly nancy dean

slid from her saddle

  what sam 

  theyre gone sam criecf hoarsely

  gone

  the rocks all knocked down some-
bodys done it calves couldnt

  they led their mounts over the loose
rocks and through the narrow gap into the
bowl there was no shifting of startled
yearlings they made their way to the
back side the place was empty sam
struck a match and mrs dean saw that
he was squatting at the edge of a pool

  little seep sam explained skim
of ice broke through at this edge where
a calf stepped and not frozen again
hasnt had time calves havent been gone
long see where they trailed water with
their feet plumb fresh yet

  that cattle thiefs beat you to them
her jaws snapped

  tonky wasnt to be here till midnight
like i told you sam struck another match
and looked at his big tin watch ten
he said

  hes taking them to his strip de-
clared mrs dean with conviction

  tonky jones had inherited from his
father a ranch of twenty sections or so-a
small area in this land of great ranches
tt extended in a long narrow strip from
the other side of this rimrock to the mexico
border the senior jones had so chosen
it in the early days for a trap when cat-
tle drifted on to it he would drift them
casually down to the mexico line and sell
them to unscrupulous buyers it was more
than suspected that tonky was emulating
the example that had proven fatal to his
father lie had come twice from the grand
jury unscathed but the cowmens hearts
were hardening and tonkys days were
numbered

  if hes double-crossed me- began
sam savagely and stopped it was a hard

moment for him prison seemed terriblj
close he went on in a different quietei
tone ive been a fool mother but don
you worry now ill get those yearling
back or know the reason why-back to tin
stockyards too where they ought to be
nancy deans old heart thumped wit
joy at this excellent coming out of her ikiy
if tonkys doing this sam went on
hell have to take them down to the road
he cant get them over the rim any othft
way and hes just got started we cai
overtake him

  they remounted and set out at thi
mouth of the little canyon they turned of
to the right parallel with the rimrock
but rocks and huge boulders that througj
the ages had rolled down from the rim am
lay on the upper reaches of the slope drov
them down hill some just as the boulder
undoubtedly had done the yearling herd
but as soon as they were past the boulde
field they kept straight along the slope

  in a surprisingly short time they mad
out a moving black blotch ahead the
pressed forward steadily sharp littl
noises reached their ears-a rider slappin
his leather chaps to urge the calves along i
pushing forward they made out two rider
driving the herd of yearlings-dim figure-
against the dim sky and quite unrecogniz
able

  the deans halted for a consultatior
there was something sinister about thosi
silent riders handling stolen cattle whtj
were they how might they be armed
and how determined were they  san
seized his mothers saddle horn and pulle
the horses together in low talking distance
ive got my old revolver he said sig
nificantly	 i

  no shooting she warned we ain 
killers

  we could ride in on them shooting ant
hollering thieves is purty easy scareci
off

  two cant make much noise to scan
with nancy dean said

  sam pondered this after a few second
he burst out with inspiration

  say the horses back by the rocks
come on well give them fellers with
the caves the scare o their lives

  he reined down the slope and she per-
force followed they trotted then gal-
loped nancy dean was an old hand in
the saddle she had helped her husband
through entire roundups she saw some-
thing now that she wanted to call to sam s
attention she pushed ahead and soon
caught up with him
sams ma

  see that she called

   yeah

  she meant the headlights that sheriff
tweed had out combing the hills only now
at least six of them were on the main road
coming toward town

  quittiv said sam jubilantly

  but nancy dean doubted it

   they found the horses still sheltering in
the lee of the rocks and headed them out
diagonally up the slope sam slapping his

thigh with h i s
old hat to hustle
them into a trot
there were six
or seven of the
animals they
were used to be-
ing rounded up
and driven the
same as cow
stock and they
kept pretty well
bunched with
sam and mrs
dean riding on
the rear flanks

  the two kept watching the string of
lights on the road it required but a few
minutes for the bright glares to enter town
and be hidden behind the buildings

  the little bunch of horses becoming
limbered broke into a gallop this was
what the deans wished but it appeared
that the loose stuff was going to outdistance
the ridden animals and get away

  sam bellowed something and nancy
dean saw what was meant-the parade of
man hunting headlights and spotlights com-
ing out on the south side of town and mak-
ing for these south hills

  sam began to whoop and slap his hat at
the horses to set them cantering again
and he yelled at his mother in wind-blown
snatches

  we gotta hurry-ride them thieves
down-git them caves-

  -hurry- went the echo of his
mother

  even at that moment the headlights were
coming through the road gate into the
ranch this was evident because alternate
cars were turning right and left to go
across the pasture land

  the range horses were galloping again
mother and son had to drive their mounts
with the quirt to keep up human eyes
could not make out a great deal hardly
more than the black bulk of the rimrock
but this was sufficient for their well de-
veloped sense of location when she



judged they had climbed far enough mrs
dean bent in on the bunchs right flank and
turned it straight along the slope at about
where she thought the calves would have
gone

  four cars at long-spaced intervals were
mounting up the hill-slope diagonally
rirst one then another swung in zigzag
style raking the thin dry grass for two or
three hundred yards with their beams

  all at once it seemed hopeless that the
deans could accomplish their purpose and
the woman slacked her horse with the
thought of calling sam and seeking con-
cealment while there was yet time but
sams voice came calling with the wild
daring of youth

  shove em ahead push em hard make
them cattle thieves think were a troop o
cavalry

  mrs dean urged her mount again the
range horses no longer climbing were will-
ing to run and she and sam soon had them
pounding along

  the unridden horses were now thunder-
ing along pell mell heads high hoofs oc-
casionally cracking on loose rocks

  then all at once the dark blotch of the
calf bunch loomed ahead it was galloping
too the riders with it were vaguely vis-
ible occupied with their own affairs they
evidently had not discovered what was
coming behind them

  nancy dean and sam together loosed
teir warwhoops a shrill ki-yi-ing and
sams pistol began to bark the surprise
was complete one of the mysterious rid-
ers let out a yell of consternation one fired
belatedly twice and both abandoned the
calves and disappeared down hill this
maneuver turned the range horses down
hill also preventing them from running
down the calves

  this aliowed sam and his mother to
come in on the rear of the yearlings sam
rode hard along one side and turned them
up the slope the climbing soon wore out
their panicky speed and they slowed
down

  the bunch was spreading out however
and both sam and mrs dean had to over-
work their jaded mounts to keep the calves
together at the same time back over their
shoulders they could see the zigzagging on-
coming automobiles

  they got the yearlings bunched again
still forcing them up hill and sam made
a hasty scout back to see if there were any
stragglers	

  weve got em all he bellowed tri-
umphantly when he regained the herd
i

short stories

  they were now at the very foot of the
rimrock but there was no hiding place
on the contrary they were standing out on
the slope for every eye to behold the

stock was white-faced herefords easy to
see in a light

  hoo-ay caves i shouted sam in his
driving urge git along and to his
mother were caught if we stay here
nother bowl up here toward the road got
to make it

  they crowded the yearlings into gallop-
ing again mrs dean behind sam at one
side they could not have held the bunch
together under such circumstances without
the rimrock on one side

  the headlights and spotlights came
nearer all the cars were coming straight
on now up hill and toward the deans as if
their fiery eyes had caught a glimpse of the
calves and the riders and meant to run them
down

  they see us shrilled nancy dean
hide sam hide and ill talk to em 

  no lights touching us yet sam denied
we can make it maybe once to that
hole-hoo-ay caves

  they -ove their jaded horses at the rear-
most yearling to rush them on the cars
were gaining rapidly and bunching as if
they were centering on their quarry like a
pack of hounds

  then the head calves began to disappear
sam realized they were clambering down
into the shallow pot against the wall he
sped around to the other side to hold them
in

  the calves were no sooner in the bowl
than it was plain that the depression was
not deep enough to hide them adequately

  for the first time nancy dean and sam
stood hopeless the cars were near when
they swerved a little more everything would
be lost the woman awaited the moment
bleakly though the heart within her was
near to turning to water and then an
unexpected thing took place that caused
her to wliisper an incredulous question into
the night

  what-what they doing

 for the cars were speeding on past no
doubt of it she watched breathlessly
they began to turn there not two hun-
dred yards away she thought they were
coming back then she realized that they
were on the road and that they were disap-
pearing in the pass that led through the hills
and around to the other side and she
understood-they were going to tonky

jones strip leaving a clear field for the

deans

nancy dean and sam had just

finished the disnes from a late
breakfast when a car drove up in
front of the little shanty-house and detec-
tive pink and a strange city-looking man
alighted pink introduced the stranger as
the railways attorney

  we found the yearlings in the stock-
yards this morning maam smiled the
roly-poly detective to mrs dean when they
were all seated

  right where i told you snapjxtd
nancy dean as unrelenting as ever you
aint got a speck of evidence on airth to de-
fend yourself with in a slander suit
yesm said pink agreeably reckon
santa claus brought them back we
thought maybe debts would be settled nicely
all the way around maam if wed come
over and offer sam a good job

  job sam and his mother exclaimed
together

  the station agent pink explained
with an insinuating glance at sam needs
a young buck with a hard head and a strong
back for a helper

  sams slate colored eyes glittered at
pink

  any chance o pummotion he de-
manded sharply

  chance of being pummoted up to be
the president of the road pink drawled
if you can make the grade

  or maybe even clear up to be a railroad
detecative sam sneered

  hell take the job said nancy dean-

and there was no
doubt about it

  sure agreed
sam meekly
and keep it
too

  he flung out
of the house and
struck off to-
ward town

  the two visitors arose and moved to the
door mrs dean was beaming with sup-
pressed satisfaction over the happy out-
come

  you know said pink ruminatively
i sort o thought yesterday that maybe you
were-uh shielding sam

  me lying about sam protested nancy
dean why i wouldnt tell a lie about
him sams my son i wouldnt lie about
my own son
  the winning ticket

     by frank richardson pierce
     author of the squaw alans mother rough going etc

    a story of the heart throbs and romance following in the wake of a
    ticket for that greatest annual event in alaska-the ice break-up

when carmack struck the
gold that started the great
stampede through skagway
over the chilkoot pass down
the river to the klondyke
sam winslow was working in a brokers
office in boston he talked gold until the
entire office force became restless and the
boss lost his temper and fired sam sam
had worked for that boss ten years and had
proven faithful the boss had expected
sam to show up the next day in a meek
and lowly mood and beg for his old job
back but sam had sworn he wouldnt sit
at his old desk again until he had dug a
sock full of gold out of alaskan or yukon
gravel like many others he believed it
could be picked up in the streets and that
the creek water was so thick with gold
a man had to let it settle before he could
take a drink

  sam arrived in due time and helped a
lot of others celebrate the first fourth of
july in dawson when it rained bullets
from american gats and so frightened the
thousands of dogs that some are running
yet that winter sam came in with enough
gold not only to fill his sock but several tin
cans as well boston was rather distant at
that moment sam spent the winter enjoy-
ing the high pressure amusements and mak-
ing a watch chain of nuggets a picture
 

of sam and his heap of gold published in
boston brought letters from all of sams
old friends it seemed that a wave of hard
luck swept them shortly after his departure
and all of them needed money loans of
course at the usual interest to tide them
over to a better day some offered good
security others securities were indefinite
sam having a good time with the world
before him shook his head

  poor devils he muttered humped
over books watching the clock breathing
second hand air scared of their jobs i
havent forgotten those days instead of
going back there and lording it over em
with my money ill just give era a hand

  youll see what the north had done to
sam he had come from a crowded city
where it was every man for himself with
little thought of the other fellow and a
season where men depend a lot on each
other had changed him and that was the
end of sam financially he sent many
thousands of dollars over the trail on jake
klines sled and he got back pieces of paper
saying i promise to pay-

  the gold in the tins was gone in the
spring some of it had gone for pleasure
but most of it had gone outside  hat re-
maining in the sock went to a grubstake and
sam moved on

  the years passed swiftly and sam was


short stories

 

forgotten by many and the first to forget
were those to whom sam had loaned

money some of the letters he sent out-
side-and he did not send them until he
was broke himself-pleaded for more time
others were unanswered and some were
returned unclaimed the northern post-
mark was sufficient of itself to hint at the
contents one letter had been steamed
open and rescaled again sam smiled with
a trace of bitterness at that-not because of
the loss of money but because people
slipped down the social scale until they did
such things

  camps that were  a million tongues
knew sam he struck the good camps and
the bad but he never again struck real
pay his limbs grew a bit stiff in time
this was because he had waded so many
icy streams and permitted his clothes to
dry from the heat of his labor heat that
goes into the drying of icy clothing never
returns to warm the blood one season
he could not prospect at all-the year he
had rheumatism sam was in a native
village when the influenza struck the world
he felt sorry for the poor devils of in-
dians and nursed them through then when
he caught it himself there was no one able
to care for him by this time sam was
used to that sort of thing he crawled
into his cabin and burned for days but
lived emerging a shaking skeleton of a
man of course he was in no shape that
year to prospect until too late to more than
scratch the ground

  but he managed to find three square
meals a day most of the time once he did
chew his moccasins and he laughed as he
did it because it reminded him of a story
he had read he had laughed when he read
the story-in the comfortable snugness of
his bunk then he had said thinks like
that never happen except in books a
lot of things had happened to sam that
would never be published in books because
thty were beyond belief-an insult to a
readers intelligence

  now he moved stiffly about his cabin
thinking not of past glories or disappoint-
ments but of the immediate future hav-
ing cooked a meal washed the dishes and
swept the cabin-most miners are very
tieat he examined the contents of his sock
it was a well worn sock-worn from hold-
ing small pokes of gold and not from
contact with his foot a moose hide poke
rolled out along with an old pocket book
containing slips of paper which read i
promise to pay the paper was yellow
with age and had worn through at the folds

in many places but the poke contained
nearly two ounces of gold he hefted it
in his hands expertly weighing it for
twenty-five dollars  can get in the ice
pool he reflected and i might le lucky

  the ice pool was an annual event in vari-
ous parts of the north-as much a part of
the community life as the ice itself the
salmon the gold and the winter trail

  when the ice went out that signaled the
ending of winter the opening of naviga-
tion then supplies came in prospectors
went forth to search bars and gulches for
gold the day the ice went out was greater
than new years or christmas to commun-
ities on ice-bound rivers for a considera-
tion a man could guess the day hour and
minute the ice would go and the man com-
ing nearest the actual time won the pot
often it amounted to thousands of dollars
this year it cost more to get into the big
poo but first prize was twenty thousand
dollars of course sam knew he would
not win it but he liad always taken a
chance-with purse and life that was the
second thing the north had done for him 
-taught him to take a cliance the first 
thing he had learned was lending a hand i
to another human being-fiot necessarily a i
friend

  ive got grub enough he mused and i
theres no reason why i shouldnt put 
twenty-five dollars into the pool if i dont i
do what ive always done these many years e
itll be because im afraid thats a sure 
sign a man is slipping-when hes afraid i
yes when the boys come around ill put i
in my ounce and a half they would be i
around in a day or two for this was a 
sporting event and every man was entitled e
to a chance

  he fried some bacon and stirred up the t
pot of sourdough-this pot was never emp- k
tied but added to from time to time in- -
suring a steady supply of batter hot tea 
seemed to warm up his joints he seemed i
less stiff in his movements then the 
gambler within asserted itself heck i 
might win that twenty-thousand after all 
no luck in twenty-five years its time i
had a change that was what he thought c
each year whenever he was fed and warm f
he voiced the thought-luck was due for a 
change heck he repeated im feeling i
lucky this spring and if i win--

  what would he do if he won well
there was a new generation about him
they lacked less of the spirit of the old
generation when the hardships were more
severe money more plentiful than now
and that reminded him he hadnt called

                                                    
the winning ticket

on old howard perry in several days
howdy as they called him was about all
in sam pulled on a parka and stepped out-
side spring was in the air right enough
he sniffed it and as he followed the river
down to perrys cabin his mind estimated
when the ice would go out several dates
were settled only to be changed at length
satisfied he grinned this year im going
to write the winning ticket

the smoke was trailing lazily from
perrys cabin sam knocked and
entered

  howdy howdy he said

  hello sam im feeling all shot to
pieces

  perry looked pretty bad but sam wisely
told the ailing sourdough he looked great

  blew the last of my dust for some medi-
cine the other went on dust id figured
to put in the pool too you see living
here this long ive worked out a system-

  perry always had a system in the old
days he devised systems of beating faro
and other games his systems never
worked except in favor of the house but
sam did not smile as he remembered this
perry was too far along the trail to make
sport of system eh sam queried

  yes ive been here ten years now
i watch the willow buds and that patch of
snow on the side hill he pointed to a
rock three thousand feet above them and
called it a side hill that was what it
was compared with the surrounding peaks
ive got it down fine now i can write the
winning ticket

  sure you can sam agreed

  but i havent any dust perry con-
tinued not even enough to buy medicine
didnt need medicine the last year or two
but now- well sam it eases the pain
it seems like it dont do a fellow no good
to live out of tin cans yfcars on end theres
something about canned grub-

  sam had been thinking he too could
write the winning ticket if he played his
lucky hunch but now he forgot the ticket
with a sigh needing dust for medicine
to ease the pain eh he said

  yep

  heres a couple of ounces if thatll help
howdy sam offered

  now sam- perry began to protest
but his words lacked conviction sam
you havent any too much dust yourself

  plenty enough to loan you a couple of
ounces sam interrupted he knew it
was a gift but preferred to call it a loan
he gave it all to the last grain his dust



that was the way sam did things then
rc wistled because he felt like whistling
of course he was pretty stiff from rheum-
atism and all that but he was better off
than howdy who was in pain always sam
reasoned the only time he was in pain
was when he moved if he didnt move
he wasn t in pain obviously he did not
move more than necessary so he limped
back to his cabin when the weather was
warmer and the heat had loosened up his
joints he would work his way to a gulch
he knew and pan a few
i ounces maybe he would
jtake out one hundred dol-
lars in two months-not
even wages-but it would
buy some flour rice and
tobacco he would dry
salmon raise vegetables
and kill a caribou or two
for meat hed manage
but it was tough to miss
the pool first time he
had missed the pool since he came into the
country too still the dust he had saved
yes denied himself for was going for a
noble purpose

  the following morning he visited the
gulch hoping maybe that tlie snow was
not as deep as usual or that perhaps a
stream beneath had wrashed out a small
quantity of dust-it had once happened
but no the snow was twenty feet deep in
that gulch it would be midsummer before
he could shovel gravel into the sluice box

  dejectedly he returned home a dog
team and several men had made themselves
at home thought you were never com-
ing sam one of the men shouted
where you been-prospecting

   a little

  any pay

  nope

  well sam youre going to get in on
the pool this year of course  sam had
been expecting that query he knew the
purpose of their visit-to give some of the
old-timers who couldnt travel much a
chance to get in on the pool    

  sam shok his head cant make it this
year boys	t

  huh

  pokes empty

  hmmm the other considered lell
you what ill do theres no stampede on
dogs are not worth much with spring ana
summer ahead give me your sandy dog
and ill pay for two chances how about
it f

  sell sandy sell that old boy who had
i

short stories

starved with him well sam guessed nut

  no he answered quickly

  ill loan you the money sam sandy
bsecurity enough

  sam hesitated he sure had a lucky
hunch this time something told him may
d at two oclock a m the ice would go
out twenty thousand dollars on the
other hand-

  no he said almost furiously i
wont dont tempt me then lest he
weaken he ordered them away

the days dragged for sam this
was the first year he had not written
a ticket for the pool he was done
the greatest sporting event in alaska and
he not a part of it of course if he hadnt
given two ounces to howdy almost
fiercely he drove that thought from his
mind

  the ice will go out two oclock in the
morning on may second he repeated
and this was april th or would be in
five hours for it was seven oclock in the
evening

  at eight oclock a sourdough entered the
cabin just thought id drop in and pass
the news along seeing as how youre not
getting around much sam he related
incidents both local and national in im-
portance then their conversation turned to
the pool what time will the ice go out
sam

  two a m may second sam an-
swered quickly

  i dont think so i wrote my ticket for
the sixth a lot of others done the same
one fellow dont know who wrote his time
down as april twenty-eighth four oclock
in the morning thats the earliest the
next is april th two fellows  that
date and hundreds from then on great-
est pool in years well sam i must be
mushing-

  the door opened and a breed stood
framed in the entrance perry says come
dam quick he panted i get doctor
then he was gone running swiftly

  wed better go jonas sam suggested
to his visitor howdy has been ailing for
quite a spell now looks bad

  poor devil jonas reflected hes had
ft system for winning all his life and he
never won wonder if hes a system for
dying

  hope so sam replied i sure hope
so if itll make it easier he even had a
system this year for figuring the time of
the break-up claimed he could tell by the
snow on the hillside the buds on the wil-

lows and the like of that poor howdy
he ate out of tin cans too long and it got
him poor howdy

  sam dressed for the trail and with jonas
stepped outside just before they de-
scended to the frozen surface of the river
sam glanced down stream he could look
for miles from this point there was a
bend at the sjt on which he stood far
in the distance a red light gleamed a
lantern supported on a tripod from the
trijxxl there ran a line ashore attached to
a bell when the break-up came when
the ice moved then the bell rang and the
time was recorded and hell broke loose
bells rang whistles shrieked and every dog
broke into mournful howling that was
winters release of her grip on an empire
but now it was quiet deathly quiet
abruptly as if in warning the ice cracked
the men started nervously then laughed
ice often cracked tliat way this was too
early for the break-up even the reckless
sourdough who had written april th
knew the twenty-seventh was too early

  they made their way up river to perrys
cabin and entered sam and jonas ex-
changed quick glances long on the fron-
tier each had seen men die in violence and
peace die in bed die with their boots on
and six-guns flashing

  as they entered old perry gasped sam
im hitting the long trail but im not
afraid worked out a system long ago
im following it write this down

  perry dictated and sam wrote

  i howard perry in my right mind
give everything i possess to sam ivinslow
in return for his looking out for me when
he rvas too sick to look out for himself
everything i leave is sams i have no
heirs

  with an effort hesigned the paper and
jonas and sam added their names at wit-
nesses not much perry muttered a
good rifle gold pan sled and dog harness
yes and the ticket

  sam started at this he had given up
his big chance in order that perry might
have dust for medicine and perry had
spent it  an ice pool ticket denied him
his chance to play the hunch yes his
one sure hunch may d and two a m
but a man cant quarrel with a dying man
and besides perry was speaking again

  sam

  yes howdy

  didnt find out until yesterday you gave
me your last dust for medicine thats

                                                        
the winning ticket

like you sam thats why youre in alaska
instead of the warmth and sunshine where
you belong perry peered at sam with
sunken eyes i didnt know when i wrote
my ticket sam or id sent the dust back
i did need it for medicine but my system
is sure this time its-

  he stopped strength suddenly left him
his words trailed off for the effort to teli
all on his mind had cost him much sam 
he whispered turn on the light turn
on the light

  the light was on burning as brightly as
possible sam looked at jonas i wish
the doctor would hurry he whispered i
wish-

  turn the light a little higher sam
perry whispered

  sam turned up the wick until it smoked
but to the dying man the room was dark

  outside the ice cracked again  again
then again it was too early for the
break-up just yet may d sam had
guessed and his hunch told him he was
right someone had been foolish enough
to guess april th and then there was the
reckless sourdough who had written april
th on his ticket

  sam

  yes howdy

  mighty dark sam his breath was
coming in gasps though when he spoke
he managed to articulate the phrases in one
breath

  kinda dark howdy where was that
infernal doctor of course the trail was
long and he might have been on another
case lots of flu so they said

  aint getting no brighter-sam

  not much sam admitted perrys
eyes were wide open too

  and then the dying man sighed its
lighter now sam

  yes its lighter howdy sam saw
that perry had stopped breathing the
room was still in death the ice cracked
in a series of reports was it moving
they listened it sounded as if slab was
crunching against slab moving slightly
thrn it was quiet

  then through the night came another
sound the blending of whistles bells howls
of dogs cheers of humans pistol shots
until hushed by distance the sound seemed
almost musical crack  crack crack 
this was clear enough old joe hook was



cutting loose with his tlnrtv-thirty rifle a
mile up the stream the ice in front of
perrys cabin moved a few feet then
stopped then moved again the break-up
had come a sleeping monster had stirred
as the cold blood of his being moved
through his veins

  on and on the ice would go piling up
damming the flood until lowlands were
flooded then giving way with a roar crash-
ing grinding always restless until it

reached the sea
and the streams
were clear and
man and his
steamers
brought goods
for gold and
pelts

  sam opened
the door a n d
the musical
note from the
camp two miles away came loud strong
then soft almost dying at times as a lull
came people were mad with joy

  the break-up

  the words came from perrys lips
slowly softly yet clear enough and
they had thought him dead

  yes the break-up

  whats the-time

  quarter after one on the morning
of-

  the man in the bunk lifted himself up
to hear the final words then fell back and
died without hearing them

  -of april twenty-eighth sam fin-
ished

  and the next morning they buried perry
on a little knoll above his cabin poor old
perry who always had a system that never
won then sam winslow examined his
legacy rifle well oiled and cared for
dog harness well greased pots and pans
some grub and the ticket perry had written
as sam looked up he could see the snow on
the side of the hill and the buds on the
willows the roar of the break-up was in
his ears the ice flowed by in ceaseless
legions like troops rushing toward the
battlefield to fill a breach he tore open
the envelope and read the ticket old how-
ard perry had devised from his system
it read

the cheater

by charles wesley sanders

author of sweet harmony etc

  on this wild and stormy night the sheepherders were to see proved once
  more the adage that a cheater has to tlay a lone hand if iles caught

      s borton opened the door of
the sheep shearers shack a
  gust of rain-laden wind caught
y  the door from his hand and
flung it wide open borton
stepped up on the low threshold and stood
blinking against the light from the oil lamp
which was suspended from the ceiling
outside the night was bleak rain had
been falling since before dusk falling with
a steady monotony except when the wind
king puffed his checks and blew an oc-
casional swift breath

  bortons eyes quickly became accustomed
to the light and the eyes swept the room
and its occupants there were four of
these two small men one of medium
height and one of six feet or more with an
amazing breadth of shoulder bortons
gaze hung upon this man for a fraction of
a second longer than upon the other men
in that fraction of a second borton saw
that the man was eyeing him closely siz-
ing him up trying to judge by his garb
where he was from

  borton would have smiled at that if he
bad not known that u smile would mean
betrayal his dress was-what a man might
have woin anywhere a dark blufe suit high-
heeled boots stetson and black slicker
the big man he knew could gather noth-
ing from that

  well close the door stranger the man
  said doors was made to keep the
  weather out an there is plenty weather
  tonight

  its not bad borton returned ive
  seen worse weather

where

  the big man spat out the word there
  was a kind of challenge in it he might
  as well have asked where borton liailed
  from

  borton did not answer he advanced
  into the room and closed the door behind
  him taking off his hat he shook the
  water from it and dropped it on a stool
  he shrugged out of the slicker with a quick
  easy movement and hung it on a peg in
  the wall he stood revealed as a man of
  perhaps thirty he was two or three inches
  shorter than the big man and would weigh
  thirty pounds less a good deal of his
  bulk was in his chest and shoulders he
  tapered down to a lean waist and slender

les-  

the marks of sun and wind were on

his face except where his forehead had

been protected a clean white band was

there from above his eyebrows to his short

straight brown hair his eyes were blue

very clear the face was lean too but

there was the color of good health in his

cheeks good health borton had abun-

      	
i

dantly he was merely trained down to a
sharp fineness

  draw up to the fire one of the small
men invited

  borton walked over to the battered stove
and stood with his back to it his hands
behind him he stood very straight very
still his chin was lifted so that his eyes
were on the top of the far wall he be-
lieved he had come to journeys end but he
had to make sure for three months he
had been making a patient search min-
utes hours a night would make no differ-
ence

  though he did not look at the big man
he was aware subconsciously that the
mans eyes were on him he knew that
there was a look of suspicion in those eyes
they were small eyes set back beneath
jutting brows of coarse sandy hair thin
straggling sandy hair was on the mans
head the beginning of a beard of like
quality and color was on his face

  for perhaps two minutes there was sil-
ence in the room the while borton kept
his attitude and the big man stared at him
then the big man moved on his stool the
legs of it made a slight sound on the rough
floor the man cleared his throat

  immediately there was something tn the
air hostility definite with infinite pos-
sibilities lay between borton and the big
man

  there was another sound footfalls on
the rough boards borton turned his head
then turned it slowly with an effect of
vagueness in his manner two of the men
had walked over beyond the big man and
had grouped themselves behind him the
other man who had invited borton up to
the fire had stepped behind the stove so
that it was between him and borton as
borton withdrew his gaze from the trio
his eyes encountered the eyes of this man
and a brief glance of understanding passed
between them

  bortons eyes went back to the three
other men the big man drew in his thick
legs and hooked them about the legs of the
stool his mouth was indeed so clamped
that his heavy lower lip was thrust out

  where was it you seen all this bad
weather he demanded

  borton produced papers and tobacco
and rolled a cigarette

  why he said i was in a cyclone in
the oklahoma panhandle one time

  oregon is a long ways from okla-
homa the big man offered

  not as far as schenectady borton
said ive never been in schenectady

    to



    there was no hint of a smile on his lips
  no glint of humor in his eyes

   wise cracker hun the big man
 sneered you ridin a hawse

    a buckin bronc said borton cant
  ou see him tradin ends right this minute

     he man beyond the stove snickered
 above the big mans beard the strong
 flush of anger rose but he held himself in

    there was a lull like the lull in a storm
  borton took advantage of it with his
  left hand-curious how he always used his
  left hand-he dug into the ton pocket of his
  coat and produced a crumpled bunch of
  bills he straightened them out and re-
  moved a one possibly he was clumsy
  possibly not in any event the three men
  beyond him could ea ily see that several
  of the bills had yellow backs with the
  dollar bill in his hand he crumpled up the
  others and restored them to the pocket
  the dollar bill he tossed on the bare table
  before him

    t know i am welcome to anything you
 gents have got he said but i am a fella
 that pays as he goes how about a dollars
 worth of food i havent had a bite since
 before noon

    traveled far have you the big man
 asked

    some distance

    must be a good walker

    borton now fixed him with a level glance
  there was a steely quality in the blue eyes
  and just the touch of a hard smile on the
  firm lips

    fella he said when i go afoot i will
  be poorer than i am now my horse is
  up in a draw yonder sheltered from the
  rain he is a long horse and a strong
  horse me and him never tire

    the big mans eyes sought the floor
 borton thought he knew what he was
 thinking of borton was surer than ever
 that this was the man he sought he be-
 lieved that the big mans mind had begun
 to glow at sight of those yellow-backed
 bills and that it was still glowing the
 yellow of the bills had struck a yellow light
 into his brain the light of cupidity

    he looked up he made a little moist
 clicking sound with his lips he was try-
 ing hard to summon a pleasant look to his
 face but his success was not great the
 stamp of low passions was too strongly on
 it

put up your dollar fella he said
you are welcome to what food we can
offer you my name is emerson i am
runnin this sheep camp these here men
 is helpin me steve git him some tood

short stories



  the man opposite borton moved from
behind the stove and in fifteen minutes he
had bacon and warmed fwtatoes bread and
coffee on the table borton ate in silence
when he had finished he pushed back and
rolled another cigarette again with his right
hand pressed against his hip

  emerson put his heavy arms above his
head stretched and yawned

  a sheep camp on a rainy night he
complained dull gosh p

  he got slowly to his feet passed borton
and stood beyond him at the other side of
the table from his pocket he took two
dice and cast them on the table a five
and a two came up

  son of a gun he ejaculated comes
a seven and everybody listenin to the rain
borton eyed the dice without a flicker of
interest

  shoot you for your shirt steve em-
erson offered

  not me steve retorted only shirt

i got

  emerson looked down at borton there
was flame in emersons eyes now

  roll em stranger he asked ill
fade you for a nickel or ten dollars
you hinted said borton that i was
a good walker im not those dice might
take my horse away from me

  you hintin-

  fella borton broke in coldlyi never
hint those are your dice i never saw
them before

  again there was a snicker from the little
man and again that flush of fury beneath
emersons eyes but he held himself in
check he wanted to smooth out that
crumpled roll in the strangers pocket
smooth out those bills caressingly with his
heavy blunt fingers

  how about a little game of stud
he insinuated just you and me these
boys is temprarily short

  you cleaned them did you

  not me aint had a play since i got
here

  oh you havent been here long
havent been here for one pay day yet
eh

  he had lifted his head and now his eyes
bored into emersons emerson paled
his hand went up along his stomach in-
side his coat to his chest bortons right
hand was on his knee below the table
emersons eyes wavered his hand came
from beneath his coat

  how about a little stud he repeated
i can match your roll

  for answer borton drew the money from

his pocket again he smoothed out the
bills and put them at his elbow as he
squared himself before the table

  hundred and sixty dollars there he

said

  emerson dug into an inside pocket and
produced a bill fold from this he ex-
tracted a dozen bills he counted them

  one fiftys all i got he said drag
down ten and ill play you table stakes

  borton withdrew a ten emerson pulled
out a drawer in the
table and took from
it a greasy pack of
cards borton
glanced at them and
gathered up his
money

  matter emer-
son frowned

  i dont doubt that has been a good deck
of cards in its day borton said but its
day is long gone by if there aint a new
deck of cards in this shack all bets is off

  why gosh-

  i got a new deck steve said ill
get it

  he went to a bunk at the far end of the
room and fumbled out an unopened deck
of cards he handed it to borton borton
looked at it and found the seals unbroken
he tossed it to emerson emerson broke
it open

  wanna run the joker wild he asked

  youll find a joker an advertising card
and a card givin instructions on how to
play auction bridge in that deck borton
said lets call all three of them jokers
and let em run as wild as a locoed steer

  emerson seemed to be taken a little
aback he turned the deck face up and
spread the cards along the table with the
palm of his hand

  three of em is runnin wild he mur-
mured seven aces in the deck for in-
stance	

  seven aces-for instance borton
agreed

  me deal

  shoot but let me cut em

  while emerson dealt borton rolled an
other cigarette he kept his eyes on the
paper he did not look at emerson em-
erson seemed to be a clumsy dealer he
riffled the cards slowly for his second
card he showed an ace against bortons
king borton breathed and emerson bet
five dollars

  i always play em when i got em he
said

  its a good system borton said as he

                                                          
the cheater

pushed a five dollar bill to the center of the
table

  borton got a second king for his fourth
card showing a pair of kings against era-
jersons lone ace

  good for ten more borton said

  emerson raised him ten and borton
stayed the last cards did not improve
either hand

  borton hesitated or appeared to do so
his eyes were on those two kings he
seemed absorbed in the contemplation of
them in fact he was waiting he was
listening he wanted to see whether em-
erson would tell him it was his bet em-
erson didnt

  youre as good a gambler as i thought
you were borton said to himself got
patience havent you tip nothing off

  he hesitated a moment longer then he
suddenly lifted his face and eyed emerson
again there was that steely look in his eyes

  spose you bet that pair of aces you
got he said

  emerson could relax now he could
jest the game was in his own hands
unless borton had a buried king or a
card to make an added pair

  mebbe you think i aint got a little joker
lyin on its stummick he jeered

  im waitin for you borton retorted
mebbe i got somethin in the hole my-
self

  ill feel you out for ten said emerson

  you might as well make thirty as ten
borton said and he covered emersons bet
and shoved a twenty in on top of it

  no change of expression came to emer-
sons face he flipped over his hole card
and disclosed a joker borton gathered up
his four cards put them on top of his hole
card and readied for the deck

  haw said steve he run a blazer
on you

  theres a lot more blazers where that
un come from steve emerson declared

  mebbe said steve

  borton looked up at the little man
blandly

  steve he said im a mite to the good
spose you sit in ill stake you to forty
bones

  me i will said steve and drew up a
stool

  stakin a man queers the game em-
erson grumbled puts the kibosh on it
man starts with a shoe string and comes
out with boots to stock a store

  ive seen that happen borton agreed
cheerfully as he dealt the cards

  there was little play on his deal and not
  

much more on steves emersons deal

came again both steve and borton drew
their stools up so close to the table that
their stomachs were pressed against the
edge they leaned a little forward their
eyes were fixed on the cards in emersons
hands they watched him closely very
closely he gave no sign that he was
aware of their scrutiny except tliat that hot
flush came up under his eyes again

  he lost twenty dollars to steve on his
own deal on bortons he lost twenty
more on steves deal he stayed out
though he liad a small pair showing against
no visible pair in front of either of the
other men once more the two men fixed
their eyes on the cards in his hands

  whatcha lookin at so close he
snarled

  watchiu a good man deal borton
smiled

  when the deal came around to him
again emerson had only thirty dollars in
front of him he liad lost on his own deal
and again on bortons when borton turned
up a joker to match a pair of fives

  a sullen look liad come into emersons
eyes but as he felt the cards in his hands
he essayed a smile

  got to pull somethin on my own deal
he said

  he shuffled clumsily the cards flut-
tered in his hands the entire middle o
the deck hopped out some cards falling on
the table some on the floor

  he cursed mildly and stooped and
gathered the cards from the floor keeping
his eyes above the edge of the table so that
lie could watch the two other men when
he found them both busy rolling cigarettes
lie dropped his head when he came up
he liad half a dozen cards in his hand
both borton and steve liad been slow with
their cigarettes their eyes were occupied
with them emerson found that he was at
last not watched his face was impassive
as he dealt the first two cards around he
liad an ace showing and borton had a king
and steve a queen when three cards
were lying face up before each man emer-
son still had his lone ace and borton a pair
of kings and steve a pair of queens bor-
ton bet twenty dollars and steve stayed
emerson raised for all he had

  bortons eyes went to the deck the
first two cards had slipped from the top
of it so that the back of the third card-
emersons card-showed borton put out
his hand as if he were going to consider
his hole card again the hand barely
touched the card it shot from that card

to the deck snatched up the deck and drew
it to him

  emerson thrust
himself back from
the table his hand
went inside his coat
borton did not rise
he had seized the
deck with his left
hand now he shook
his right hand and it
came above the table there was a small
gun in it

  dont try it macklin he said icily
you cant get it out this is a small gun
a man has to have a small gun to carry it
in his sleeve but it will pump you full of
lead before you can get that gun out of
your shoulder holster hoist your hands
macklin so steve can get your gun

  macklin lifted his hands there was
nothing else he could do his fingers only
were inside his coat they were several
inches from his gun

  for an instant he seemed more concerned
about steves touching him-little steve
who had worked for him and whom he
therefore despised-than he seemed con-
cerned about bortons having held him up

  runt he said hoarsely if you lay a
finger on me i will kill you

  you kill me said little steve why
fella if you give me any of your lip i will
blow you apart i got a forty-five in my
bag an it shoots as true as any gun you
ever see i kin handle that gun too i
could tear you wide or i could crease tliat
thick scull of yours whichever took my
fancy you make one move an see what
i will do to you

  the big man stared steve had come
here two days after he himself had come
steve had been the meekest guy why
he had cooked for emerson and had
washed his share of the dishes

  so steve took emersons gun and made
sure he had  other weapon of any kind
he stood lack and borton put his own
gun into his pocket

  have a seat macklin he said

  emersons my name the man de-
clared

  im givin you the name o macklin
suits me borton glanced at the three
other men beyond the table you fellas
armed 

  ony me and emerson had guns steve
said i made sure of that last night

  who are you emerson demanded

im the cook steve grinned if you
want somethin out of my wagon come and

get it otherwise talk to mr borton
  mister- emerson began

  shut up said borton he took up the
deck of cards macklin he went on
there are three card tricks you know all
of them clumsy you mark the aces with
your finger nails lightly so the marks will
show just a little you can deal cards
from the bottom and from the deck you
specialize in aces when there aint no joker
that was why  suggested we play with
three jokers i wanted you to have a
chance to get acquainted with them look
here	

   pie put in the center of the table the third
card in the deck the card which would
have gone to macklin on the last deal

  theres the mark of your nail  that
card lets have a look at the aces and
the other jokers all marked you see
you shoved those two cards off the top
of the deck to make sure you had a joker
cornin to you on that last deal you were
going to put the cleaner on me and my
friend steve

your friend steve how come-
i never met steve before tonight bor-
ton interrupted but i had a letter from
him it was a mans letter it was signed
stephen brown good plain name that
well get down to cases the man
snarled whats this all about i deny
i marked them cards or that i can deal

across the table trying to grapple with him
borton came to his feet as he spoke and his
right fist crashed against macklins jaw

before he went down bortons left fist
came up and caught him on the under side
of the jaw he sprawled then and lay
still

steve borton said

  steve went to his bag and came back
with a folded paper emerson lay still for
ten minutes or more then he opened his
eyes lifted his head and pushed himself

vacantly for a space and then fury burned
in his eyes

quietly

a mysterious

there are very few of us who one
time or another have not felt that
clutch at our throats that feeling of hope-
less despair that comes when we fear for
the safety of someone who is dear to us
and who is missing at an expected moment
we may reassure ourselves in a thousand
ways that things are all right that such and
such an innocuous happening may account
for the disappearance yet our minds go
flying voluntarily to tales of accidents and
holdups and sudden death in countless
ways perhaps some of us have even been
sobered by the chill police news that the
missing persons bureau does not act until
 hours of non-appearance have elapsed
but there are none of us but have felt a
surge of relief at sound of a long expected
step on the stair or voice calling on the
telephone

  because of all this every normal person
gets a thrill from reading a clever mystery
story in which the plot centers around the
disappearance of someone now j s
fletcher is perhaps today the leading writer
of clever mystery stories and our new
serial starting in the next issue of short
stories is by him and called the missing
chancellor

  fascinating as are stories of mysterious
disappearances this one presents an unusual
complication-the man who disappeared
was of dual personality had been leading a
double life in which of his characters was
he to be sought  who knew of his double
existence and was he in danger on that
account the situation offers endless pos-
sibilities for development-and mr flet-
cher has made the most of them

  and speaking of the missing chancel-
lor there are also many fascinating things
 be said of the author j s fletcher is
an englishman and perhaps the most in-
teresting item about him in connection with
the united states is the fact that during a
very troublesome season of president wil-
sons carcer a newspaper correspondent
undertook to ascertain the title of the mys-
tery story the president was reading it

disappearance

 turned out to be the middle temple
 murder by j s fletcher whereupon
 fletcher acquired a great many new read-
 ers who were amazed at how prolific this
 author had been

   mr fletcher has been a journalist for
 forty years is a member of the royal his-
 torical society an archaeologist and anti-
 quarian author of such books as a short
 life of cardinal newman a longer life of
 lord roberts and volumes of poems but
 it is as an author of mystery stories that
 he is best known to the fiction loving public
 we learn that the missing chancellor
 is no  in the list of his novels and stories
 written for diversion well we can prom-
 ise youll find it diverting enough

 editor short stories

 dear sir

    i am about to drop you a few lines con-
 cerning a certain writer whose stories you
 publish in short stories-one w c
 tuttle

   i picked up an issue of short stories
 at a small bookshop and as was always my
 habit thumbed the pages over to see if any
 particular story should strike my fancy but
 at last  turned back to the first story
 namely the web of deception written
 by none other than w c tuttle the
 web of deception is the best story i have
 ever read in the past or will read in the
 future of the western story species the
 characters in it were somewhat humorous
 but as to the story itself i never before read
 a more spectacular and mysterious a story
 of western life that i can remember it
 surely keeps you guessing as to just what
 is going to happen next you are so en-
 thralled you cannot stop reading you must
 go on and finish it the ending is such a
 surprise that you almost feel like reading it
 i

  incidentally in his complete novel in
this number tuttle describes some of the
activities of cultus collins tracking out-
laws near the mexican border and the fol-
lowing letter describes some of mr tuttles
own adventures in that vicinity

  went on a little hunting trip into mex-
ico last week we had one devil of a time
getting our guns across the border at tia-
juana we had permits from the mexi-
can secretary- of state but it seemed that
a new order had gone into effect cancelling
all these well we were up against it
but it seems that there is always a way
so we ditched the guns on the american
side went to tiajuana old town and
woke up the mayor actually got him
out of bed and told him what we were up
against

  so he wrote out a lengthy document
plastering it officially and when we showed
it to the mexican custom gang they were
so darned servile that they even forgot to
stamp our automobile passes we sure
went through a-whoopin and just outside
of ensenada the custom gang objected to
our unstamped passes until they read that
letter nd then it didnt matter whether we
had any passes or not

  but the hunting was the bunk we
rode ancient mexican broncs over the rim
of the world and shot quail listened to a
chorus of possibly a million coyotes and
fell back down the mountain in the dark
no ducks nor geese it is a beautiful
country-for mexicans of course their
law will not allow an american to own land
within  miles of the border nor within
 miles of the coast-and that just about
queers it as far as americanos are con-
cerned

       custers pistol

we are indebted to a reader mr
robert corathers of weston w
va who sends us an item which is timely
in view of the fact that the commemoration
of the fiftieth anniversary of the death of
gen george a custer at the battle of the

little big horn is still fresh in the public
mind the item concerns the possession of
general custers pistol and reads as fol-
lows 

  hureka calif an old cap and ball
pistol with the name g a custer stamped
on its barrel is a treasured possession of
emil santsche an old swiss gunsmith of
this city

  he says the gun was carried by general
custer at the battle of little big horn

   it was traded to him for a sixteen gauge
shot gun at butte city mont during the
winter of  by an indian who said he
and his brother were scouts with general
custers troops and had directed custer to
the indian village in the valley of the little
big horn prior to the fatal day of june

the ice sweepstakes

just about the time tliat frank richard-
son pierce sent in his story the win-
ning ticket in this number of short
stories newspaper stories began to appear
of the ice break-up in alaska one dis-
patch from nenana alaska read

   preparations are under way to observe the
annual departure of the ice in tanana river here
aud the greatest sweepstakes in the in story of
the famous classic is expected it will exceed
last years 

   tickets have been printed and numbered and
requests are coming in from many points out-
side of alaska as formerly each guess on the
ice break up will cost  each person can buy
as many guesses as he has dollars

   a red white and blue stake has been fastened
in the solid ice in midstream of the tanana
across the river is a taut wire so stretched
tliat it lacks but one inch of touching the up
right stake at the end of the wire at the city
hall is an electrical device with an alarm system
the moment the ice starts to go out the stake
will bulge the tight wire and start the alarm
the person or persons guessing the exact time of
the break up wins all or a share of the stakes

   last year the ice went out may ii but this
spring due to a mild winter the break up is ex-
pected a week or ten days sooner but old-timers
are guessing around the may date which has been
the winner for several years last spring the
money was divided into six shares that number
of persons picking the correct time

   it is a unique form of betting which does
make for thrills in both fact and fiction

       next time v

besides the first of the j s fletcher
serial in the next number there are
many outstanding features the complete
novel is a thomson burtis story of the

dandruff is a disease difficult to
curebut easy to check read below
about the best way to combat it

  its a danger signal

joandruff is a danger signal if
you have it you should do something
about it

  perhaps you never knew it before
but dandruff is a germ disease it
spreads by infection from personal
contact as with the common use of
combs and brushes children for in-
stance are never troubled with dan-
druff until actually infected by some
contact

  dandruff is a disease difficult to
cure but easy to check it has a ten-
dency to reappear unless properly
treated and often brings with it the
possible loss of hair or actual baldness

  the ideal treatment to combat dan-
druff conditions is the systematic use
of listerine the safe antiseptic

  we have received hundreds of un-
solicited letters from listerine users
who are most enthusiastic in their

claims for what listerine will do in
this way if you are troubled with
dandruff you owe it to yourself to try it

  using listerine for dandruff is not
complicated you simply douse it on
your scalp full strength and massage
thoroughly the effect is antiseptic
cleansing and healing and you will be
amazed to see how this treatment fol-
lowed systematicallycombats dandruff
moreover listerine will not discolor
the hair nor will it stain fabrics

  not only men but women have be-
come devoted users of listerine for
this purpose-women particularly
since bobbed hair has been in vogue
and has made them more conscious of
dandruff if it happened to be present

  try listerine this way used sys-
tematically the results are almost
miraculous  - lambert pharmacal
