    young wild west in death canyon

or arietta and the mad miner

by an old scout

chapter i-young wild west hears about
the dangers of death canyon

 young wild west the champion deadshot
prince of the saddle and well-known boy hero
of the wild west was riding through a desolate
canyon in the northern part of arizona with chey-
enne charlie and jim dart his two partners and
the three girls who traveled with them on their
trips in search of excitement fun and adventure
it was toward the close of a september day a
few years ago when things were in a wilder
statethan at present in that great section of the
country commonly called the wild west so much
has been written about our dashing young hero
and his friends that it is hardly necessary to
give them an introduction but for the benefit of
those who may not have heard of them we will
say that young wild west though but a boy in
vears was in every other sense a man he was a
born lighter and his strict adherence to the right
and his many hazardous exploits in bringing
wrong-doers to justice had made for him a name
that many an older person would have been proud
to possess courage skill daring coolness
strength agility and good judgment were all em-
bodied in the make-up of the boy and beine
handsome and with the figure of a well-trained
athlete he certainly was a young fellow who was
bound to find a warm placa in the hearts of all
those who have a fondness for reading of true
heroism he invariably wore a fancy hunting
suit of buckskin and with his long light hair
hanging over his shoulders he made the true
picture of a dashing young westerner who knew
not what fear meant and who was bound to do
what he thought was right no matter what the
cost this was especially so when he was mount-
ed on his gallant sorrel stallion spitfire a steed
that had never been beaten in a race whether it
was for glory or life or death and which pos-
sessed intelligence and endurance that was not
known to the average run of horseflesh

  he had won the title of champion deadshot
of the west when he was scarcely sixteen and
since that time he had held it against all comers
it was not strange then that the boy should take
pride in what he could do that was only human
cheyenne charlie the scout and indian fighter
though some years his senior was proud to call
young wild west his leader and adviser and

jim dart who was a boy about the same age as
the dashing young deadshot loved him as though
he were a brother the girls who generally
traveled with our hero and his two partners were
arietta murdock the charming golden-haired
sweetheart of young wild west anna the wife
of cheyenne charlie and eloise gardner the
sweetheart of jim dart though anna must have
been well past the age of twenty and married at
that she was classed as a girl by them and they
always spoke of the three as the girls  our
friends were finely equipped for camping out on
the mountains and plains they had with them
two chinese servants who led the pack-horses
that carried the outfit these servants were
brothers named hop wah and wing wah and
they were typical of their race in looks and
speech though one of them was not half as inno-
cent as he looked this was hop wah the fact
was that he was far above the average son of
the flowery kingdom in many ways he was
really a very clever magician and a born humorist
added to these accomplishments if we may call
them such he was a professional gambler and
he liked the cards and dice about as well as he
liked whisky which he always spoke of as tan-
glefoot but any bad habits that he may have
had were more than offset by his wonderful clev-
erness in assisting our hero and his friends in
times of danger

  hop was not a fighter nor could he shoot with
any degree of accuracy but more than once had
he saved their lives by his ready wit and sleight-
of-hand wing his brother had once thought
himself something above the ordinary run of his
race and he had tried to be a sport but hop
was so far ahead of him in this respect that the
moment he realized it he gave it up and settled
down to be just what he was at the time our
story opens a good cook who minded his own
business and dozed when he had nothing else to
do as we have stated it was tosvard the close
of a day in september when we find young wild
west and his friends riding through a desolate
canyon it was one of the parts of arizona
where vegetation is scarce and where bleak-look-
ing rocks and sand are plenty about the onl 
living things that were to be seen consisted of
three or four vultures that were soaring high in
the air no doubt looking for carrion that might
lay somewhere among the rocks our hero and
	young wild west

his charming sweetheart were riding at the head
of the column as they usually did when there
was no known danger threatening cheyenne
charlie and his wife came next and behind them
rode jim dart and his sweetheart the two
chinamen brought up the tail-end of the party
the pack-horses trotting along after them they
were all in hopes of finding a suitable place to
camp and according to the young deadshots
reckoning there must be a water hole not far
away wild as the boy was called by his friends
had been that way once or twice before and so
had his two partners but the girls had never
been though they had been in many similar
places

  by the looks of things this canyon is a pretty
long one said our hero as he shaded his eyes
with his hand and looked ahead there are miles
and miles of it i reckon  dont know the name
of it or whether anyone has taken the trouble to
give it one but it certainly is not a very cheerful-
 coking place it is a good thing we brought
along that bundle of firewood for there is noth-
ing around here that woud serve the purpose of
kindling a fire

  thats right wild answered arietta nod-
ding her golden head we have water enough
to last until we want to start out in the morning
in case we dont happen to find the water-hole you
spoke of but as you are certain that the river
is not more than fifty miles from here we could
make out anyhow we have experienced such
things before you know and have come out all
right too

  thats right et i reckon we can make out
all right we generally know what kind of a
countrv we are going through before we set out
and ifwe cant get through all right i reckon no
one can

  the canyon was a rather wide one and the
sleep cliffs on either side reared themselves to a
great height in many cases nowhere did there
seem to be a chance to leave it so that meant
that they must proceed straight on

  when we went through here once afore wild
we struck a gang of crooks said cheyenne char-
lie as they rode on their way it was quite a
lively time we had with em fer a while but they
soon found that we wasnt no tenderfoot crowd

  yes charlie i remember was the reply
that was about a year ago if t remember right

  jest about there wasnt no name ter ther
canyon then so it aint likely there is now

  whats that you say my friend no name
to the canyon eh  well that is where you
make a mistake

  the voice came from behind a high clump of
rocks and as our friends turned their gaze that
way in surprise they saw a man coming into
view he was a rather young man and by his
y neral appearance must have been a prospector
 -ere was something about his manner that indi-
cated he was either worried or frightened and
as- our hero quickly sized him up he came to the
conclusion that though he was not exactly a
stranger in those parts he had not been there
very long the polish of a man not used to rough-
ing it was not yet worn off even though his cloth-
ing and boots were well worn

  helv tranger called out young wild west

in death canyon

a he brought his sorrel stallion to a halt and
gazed at the young man curiously so there is
a name to the canyon eh

  yes theres a name to it and a very fitting
one too replied the stranger it is called
death canyon

  death canyon why ive been to a place that
was called that but it was not in these parts
so of course this cant be the same one a fit-
ting name you say tell us why please
because death lurks in all parts of it espe-
cially after you get near the other end if it
dont come from starvation after you lose your
way it comes from other sources and some of
them are very mysterious too i would not at-
tempt to go on through if ten thousand dollars
were offered me though it is the nearest cut to
rag flat the mining camp that is where  am
bound but i know a way to get to the high
ground and that is the route i am going to take
i saw you folks coming so i thought i would wait
here and warn you

  we are much obliged to you my friend it
certainly is very kind of you to do that you
must be acquainted at rag flats as you call it
i am i have been there three or four times
it is there that i have to go to get my supplies
you know i am a prospector and i mean to
stick at it until i strike it rich or my money is
all gone others have struck it rich around here
and there is no reason why i shouldnt

  i like your confidence said wild with a
laugh you deserve to succeed all right but
what is your name

  harry muller now what is yours if i may
ask

  young wild west

  i thought so when i saw you coming ive
heard the men at the camp speak of you quite
often i am glad to meet you young wild west
the prospector put out his hand and our hero
shook it warmly for he was now convinced that
he was an honest yount man who meant nothing
but what was right wild then introduced the rest
of the party and when this had been done he
looked at harry muller curiously and said

  so you waited here to advise us not to go on
through death canyon did you

  yes i was just turning this way for the path
that leads up out of the canyon when i saw you
coming i thought it best to tell you

  well we cant take your advice
y ut u are not n  through are

   he young mans face fell as he spoke

  yes thats just what we are going to do you
say that is the nearest way to get to rag flat
but it is not for that alone that we are going that
way from what you said there is some sort of
danger to be encountered and that is what we
are looking for-danger

  v ou are eh  and the prospector turned and
looked at the girls you surely are not going
hopet	canyon with the young ladies i

   reckon the are not afraid

    ut	k cried the young man some-

thin will happen to you if you do dont take

          des into such danger-dont young
wid west
young wild west

  see here harry muller suppose you go with
us if the girls are not afraid you should not
be

  the prospector hesitated a moment and then
he retorted

  if you really mean to go through death can-
yon i will go with you

chaptee ii-our friends camp at the water-

hole

  harry muller was evidently not afraid to go
through death canyon even though lie believed
it to be an exceedingly dangerous place no
doubt he had heard enough about young wild
west and his partners to convince him that they
were of the sort who were bound to succeed
where others failed but the very fact that they
intended to go through and take the girls with
them was quite enough to cause him to make up
his mind to accompany them since he had been
asked to do so

  thats the way to talk said young wild
west in reply to the young mans declaration

  his horse and burro which he used to carry his
outfit was standing near and he was not long in
getting them mounting he joined the party and
then rode on through the canyon as they went
past the spot our hero could see the path muller
had intended to follow before he saw them com-
ing

  its a good thing to know where that is
boys he remarked to his partners some time
we might need it in case we want to get out of
the canyon in a hurry

  thats right wild the scout said but i
reckon we wont have to git out of here in a
hurry not very soon anyhow were going right
on through to rag flat an we dont care if
theres forty outlaws an a whole lot of mysterious
men running around with skulls no sich galoots
as they are kin scare us

  the sun was now touching the jagged line of
the mountains to the west it would not be very
long before darkness would come when muller
declared that the water-hole was only two or
three miles further on they all felt pretty easy
for though they had enough water to last them
until the next day it would be good for the horses
to have all they could get on through the rugged
canyon they rode and it was not long before
they reached the water-hole there was not a
great deal of water in it as they found when they
got there but quite enough to answer their pur-
pose it was rather brackish in taste but their
horses were used to that so there was no real
inconvenience to be suffered in that way

  you two chinamen get a hustle on you and
get the camp in shape said wild as he dis-
mounted

  alice light misler wild came from hop and
wing almost as if in one voice and they were
upon the ground in a jiffy so many times had
they loaded and unloaded the pack-horses and put
up tents and then taken them down that they
had it down fine so to speak they worked with
a regular system and when the prospector saw
how rapidly they went ahead he was not a little

in death canyon	

astonished as soon as the tents had been erect-
ed and the horses tied so they might not stray
away wing went for the bundle of fagots they
had brought along with them and soon had a fire
started the coffee kettle was hung over the
blaze and while that was steaming away venison
and bear-meat was preparing for broiling over
the coals when the blaze died down

  you seem to have a good supply of provisions
with you remarked muller as he looked over
the outfit i was just about out and thats why
i was heading for rag flat

  well we genei-ally arrange it so that we have
about what we want answered wild you see
we always try to make our trips so that we are
never more than three or four miles away from a
town or mining camp by doing that it is easy
to keep supplies

  yes thats so but in my line when in trav-
eling all around in places i have never been be-
fore all the while looking for gold there are
times when i dont strike civilization in weeks
this time i have been out for ten days and it is
very little i have found to pay me for the time
but ill strike it rich yet i feel certain of it
you dont think it worth while to stake a
claim over at rag flat then wild queried

  no i made up my mind that i wouldnt do
that until a last resort as far as i have noticed
i dont think there are very many getting rich
over there though they all seem to make enough
to keep things going im looking for something
better than there is to be found right around the
mining camp

  thats right theres nothing like going after
big game muller

  but take my advice an dont spend all yer
money afore yer go back to ther camp and stake
out a claim advised the scout a galoot dont
stand much show in a mining camp if he aint got
no money to back him of course he kin go to
work for somebody else but a man with your
education an ideas dont want ter go to work for
somebody else i reckon

  i dont unless i have to and the prospector
laughed good-naturedly i wont say that i
wouldnt be willing to work for someone else if
i could do no bettter but i still have a couple
of hundred dollars left and im going to stick it
out until thats gone

  in a little while the supper was ready and
when the prospector sat down to it he declared
it was the first l-eal square meal he had had a
chance at in over a week

  im not much of a hunter he said or i sup-
pose i would fare bettter i cant shoot a deer on
the run to save my life and its very seldom a
fellow can get one standing ready to be shot
you should practice in shooting a little bit
spoke up ariettta anyone can learn to do it
if they only try liard and keep at it

  i cant agree with you on that miss ariettta
and the young man shook his head there are
some people who could never learn to shoot
straight even if they kept at it every day for
years i am satisfied to that for im one of that
kind

  after the supper was over they all engaged in
conversation it was now fast getting dark and
as they had very little in the line of firewood the
	young wild west

fire was allowed to go out but a couple of lan-
terns were lighted so they could all see each other
quite plainly and the near vicinity it was just
then that the clatter of hoofs sounded near at
hand

  someone coming i reckon exclaimed charlie
thats right answered our hero but as we
dont know just who or what they are i reckon
we had better be prepared for anything that
might happen girls get behind the rocks
maybe the outlaws are coming suggested
muller his face paling we should have gone
on up the path and left the canyon

  take it easy advised our hero in his cool
and easy way

  though they left the lanterns right where they
were all hands took pains to get behind the
rocks the hoof-beats came nearer and in less
than a minute seven horsemen galloped straight
up to the camp and came to a halt as our friends
peered at them from behind the rocks they saw
that their facer- were covered with masks some-
thing was going to happen and they all knew it

chapter iii-the masked horsemen get the
worst of it

  young wild west was just as cool as he ever
was in his life when he peered from behind a
rock and saw that the horsemen were masked

  hello called out one of the masked men who
was evidently the leader are yer all asleep
here

  i reckon not answered the young deaashot
quickly what do you galoots want anyhow

  cant you guess came the query with a
short laugh yer oughter be able ter tell by
ther looks of us that were after what money an
valuable you have got here but there aint no
use in talkin about it jest step out an shell out
what you have got were ther outlaws of death
canyon an we generally has our way about
things so long as yer dont put up a fight well
let yer alone but the minute any of yer goes ter
firiri a shot down yer go ther whole business of
yer i reckon you kin see us well enough ter
know that weve got yer covered

  thats all right now since you have had
your say ill have mine ill give you galoots just
sixty second- to turn around and ride away from
here if you dont go in that time you never will
go you hear what i say it is young wild
west who i- talking to you maybe you have
heard of him and maybe you have not but ill
give you my word that when your horses go away
from here unless you start right away they will
be without riders

  thunder exclaimed one of the masked men
loud enough for our friends to hear him

  there was a short silence and then the ma-ked
leader -poke again

  come we dont want no foolin about this
you know very well that weve got you dead ter
rights so step up an be quick about it we aint
thpr sort of galoot what stand- any foolin

  the fact the marked villain could not see
kny of our friends for they had taken thp pie-
biitinn t t behind the rocks at our heros

in death canyon

suggestion before the villains camo in sight of
them it was evident that they had heard of
young wild west before or else one of them
would not have made the exclamation they heard
but the man leading them seemed to be one of
the persistent sort and suddenly he fired a shot
at what he thought was a human figure close to
one of the rocks the bullet went past our hero
close enough for him to hear its hum and then
satisfied that thei-e was nothing else to do he took
quick aim at him and pressed the trigger crack
as the report rang out the man threw up his
arms and dropped from the saddle crack crack
charlie and jim fired almost simultaneously and
two more riders were unseated but the rest
must have been ready to flee at an instants no-
tice for the echo of the first report had not died
out when they were galloping away

  i reckon they got a little more than they bar-
gained for said our hero coolly as he nodded
to the prospector who was crouching close to the
ground gripping a revolver tightlv as though he
expected he would have to put up a fight even
though he died for it

  it had all happened so quickly that it hardly
seemed possible that the villains could have got
away in such haste

  come charlie said wild in a low tone of
voice i reckon well see where they went to

  without any loss of time whatever the two
crept from behind the rocks and started in the
direction the four survivors had taken as they
rounded a turn in the clilt they saw them gath-
ered in a little patch of moonlight about a hun-
dred yards from the -pot but just as thev got
near enough to open fire upon them thev heard
one of the men exclaim

  come on boyv theres only one thing for
us to do an that is for us to go back an report
to ther captain theyve got too good a place
for us to think of gettin them out of there
on   am  n ue n kn back there so come

  before wild could stop him the scout raised
his revolver and fired a shot but as the boys
hand touched his arm at that moment the bul-
et merely grazed the top of one of the villains
nats hut that was quite enough to start them
live u away they went riding for their

    i reon that wil be about all for the present
anyhow observed our hero come on back
charlie the chances are that there are more
oi them and that they will probably come back
here but i reckon we can fix up things so that
we will he able to hold our own

  reluctantly the scout followed him back to
the camp

  have they gone wild arietta asked
ics they have gone to report to their cap-
tain was the reply it seems that the one i
hot was not the reol leader he must have
come here with the others to see what he could
do with us rut he never lived long enough to
do anything that amounted to anything i reck-
dne  thrtel lle kame and ho got his medi-

 vr and you must have shot another of them
just now

  well chared but i didnt want him to
young wild west

kill any of them while they were going away so
i just pushed up his arm enough to spoil his aim
we dont want to do that kind of fighting

  but we heard ther galoots say they was goin
ter report to their captain spoke up the scout
that was plain enough that they meant ter git
more men an come back after us i reckon i
thought we might as well settle ther hash of
ther whole lot of em an have done with it a
white man what goes around with a mask on his
face aint no better than an injun with his war
paint on there aint no rubbin that out no
matter how yer take it

  there was no use in arguing the question with
charlie as every one knew they let him have
his own way about it harry muller declared
that he had seen more real excitement that eve-
ning than he had since the time he rode through
the canyon

  i wish we were safe in rag flat he said
we have got a good chance to get there for all
we have got to do is to go up the path a little
back of here and then we can fool the outlaws
well you can go if you want to wild an-
swered i reckon we are going to see this thing
out i wouldnt turn back now if i knev there
were a hundred masked galoots waiting for us
oh i wont leave you now i am not that
kind of a man i dont want you to think i am
a coward young wild west

  well dont try to make me change my mind
then please i dont like it

  i wont say another word

  good now we will stay right here till morn-
ing and then we will go on through death can-
yon well get to rag flat some time to-mor-
row i reckon

  if we dont itll be ther first place we ever
sot out ter go ter an didnt git there chipped
in the scout

  the prospector thought it queer that the girls
did not side in with him when he spoke of go-
ing the other way but when he found that he
was the only one who had shown anything like
fear he changed his manner and soon declared
that he would help fight the way through to rag
flat and would show that he was not afraid so
long as he had young wild west to lead him
an extra good watch was kept that night but
the masked villains did not show themselves
again and when daylight came our friends were
stirring

  the bodies lay where they had fallen and
cheyenne charlie went out and removed the
mask- he called muller to see if he could iden-
tify any but he could not he declaring that he did
not remember of having seen them before af-
ter breakfast they got ready and then started
through death canyon ready for anything that
might turn up

chapter iv-wild is caught by the outlaws

  when young wild west and his friends start-
ed to resume their journey through death can-
yon they had all made up their minds not to be
surprised at anything that might happen they
had not gone more than a mile when they saw
three men riding right toward them leading a

in death canyon	

pack mule behind them that was loaded with a
prospecting outfit as far as they could judge

  iou want to keep an eye on thoe villains
observed our hero as he turned to his compan-
ions they look to be prospectors but i have
an idea that they are outlaws and that they
are coming this way just for the purpose of giv-
ing burial to the bodies of those we shot last
night

  you kin bet your life they are wild spoke
up the scout but it wont take long for us to
tell what kind of paloots they are alls we
want is to have a good look at em

  the three men came right along not showing
any great surprise at seeing our friends ap-
proaching them three or four minutes later
they met and both parties came to a halt

  good mom in strangers said one of the
trio as he cast a swift glance over the party
which way are yer bound

  through death canyon answered our hero
we want to get to rag flat and i reckon thats
the shortest way there

  yes thats right we jest come from there
we left yesterday afternoon an then we took
a rest till daylight an started on agin were
prospectors in ther canyon you know

  i see you are

  as wild said this he had already come to the
conclusion that the three men were villains tly
very looks of them indicated this especially as
there was a sort of sneaky way about them and
they appeared to be rather uneasy under his
gaze

  are you fellows going to rag flat to locate
queried one who acted as the spokesman

  oh we never locate anywhere very long we
are simply riding about looking for adventure
and excitement i have heard it is dangerous to
go through death canyon how about that
well we heard that too over in rag flat
but we came through all right an put in ther
best part of ther night in ther canyon an we
never seen anything that was any more danger-
ous than anywhere else around nothin bother-
ed us

  is that so well then i reckon well go
through all right but say

  well what is it asked one of the men
you said you were going prospecting i be-
lieve

  yes thats right weve got our outfit right
with us

  what are you going to dig for-gold
  sartin

  oh i thought maybe you were going to dig
graves or something of the kind

  at this the three men exchanged glances
though they were acting their parts prettj
well they could not help doing this as the boj
spoke in such a pointed way

  yes went on wild in his cool and easy way
i thought maybe you might have lost some ol
your friends-two or three of them might havt
got shot you know-and that you were on youi
way to bury them

  oh no was the quick reply as the spokes-
man recovered himself and acted in a way thai
was half surprise and half decisive then
aint but three of us an thata enough ter trava
	young wild west

together i reckon we never had no one else
with us so we couldnt very well lose em

  well i just spoke that way because you will
find two or three bodies before you go very far
we had a little skirmish last night with a band
of outlaws and the result is that three of them
lie back in the canyon they tried pretty hard
to get hold of us but it was no go but maybe
you might take a notion to give them decent
burial we didnt bother with it because we
thought some one might come along that might
want to do it more than we did

  i reckon we dont want anything to do with
any outlaws whether theyre dead or alive de-
clared the one who had not spoken before do
we boys

  i reckon not was the reply

  well i hope you have luck and wild started
his horse ahead just as though he did not care
to have anything more to say to them

  they took the hint and rode on our friends
continued on their way keeping their horses at
a jog on they rode winding this way and that
where the trail was the more even there was
so much sameness about the bare rugged rocks
on either side of them that there was no change
as far as scenery went the distance only being
about thirty-five miles wild knew that it would
not be later than afternoon when they would ar-
rive at rag flat unless something happened to-
stop their progress through the canyon

  that something would happen he felt sure for
he knew the masked band would certainly be
looking for revenge upon them for what had
happened the night before but when ten miles
had been covered and nothing came to disturb
them it began to look as though they might have
passed the place where the outlaws made their
headquarters however they had no means of
knowing just where this might be so it would be
in order for them to keep  the watch contin-
ually when just about half the distance to the
mining camp had been covered they struck a part
of the canyon that was more wild and rugged
than anything they had peen before since enter-
ing it

  queer-shaped rocks reared themselves on every
hand the steep cliffs showing on either side as a
desolate background and the clear blue sky
looming up overhead hundreds of hiding places
that might be infested by outlaws or bandits
could have been selected within a scope of half a
mile as they kept to a narrow defile where the
rocks ran up about ten feet from the ground on
both sides and where it would be necessary for
them to proceed in single file to get there wild
called a halt it looked very much like a trap
to him especially as he knew they had enemies
somewhere in the canyon

  boys said he whispeing to his partners i
reckon we have got to look out how we go
through here

  thats right wild the scout answered
aint there no omnr way jo git through
there might be around to the right suggest-
ed jim dart

  wild shook bis head then he quickly dis-
mounted and leaving his horse with his partners
he started swiftly through the defile on foot it
was rat r very long one though it had several
furrs o it and he soon came out into a wide

in death canyon

space at the other end but the boy had scarce-
ly got there when there was a whiz and as he
looked up from whence the sound came a rope
settled about his body and before he could throw
it otf it was drawn tight and he was lifted from
the ground

  look out he cried theyve got me

  wilds right arm was pinned to his side by
the rope but as he felt himself being drawn up-
ward he managed to draw the gun from the
holster at his left hip but just as he was going
to level it at the two men who were above him
who were swiftly hauling him upward a hand
reached down and knocked it from his grasp
then the boy was almost helpless even though
he had the use of his left hand if he could have
been permitted a little time the chances are that
he would have made a pretty stiff fight of it but
the distance was not great enough to permit that
and in less than ten seconds from the time the
rope had tightened about his body he was seiz-
ed by the villains there were not only tw of
them for as he was pulled over the edge of the
rock several more appeared

  all were masked but this made little differ-
ence to the boy as it is hardly likely he would
have recognized any of them as men he had seen
before anyhow

  just you shut up one of them exclaimed as
he pushed the muzzle of a revolver close to the
forehead of the dashing young deadshot you
have hollered jest about enough i reckon it
may be that we kin git more of em boys but
young wild west is ther one we wanted above
all others weve heard enough about him to
make us feel as though he would be a rich prize
jest tie him up an put a gag in his mouth an
be quick about it

  wild was not foolish enough to make any out-
cry for he knew pretty well that he was in the
hands of very desperate criminals after a very
snort space ol time he was bound hand and foot
and gagged with a piece of unraveled rope then
his captors eight in number took him up and
ctu  m log through a little hole that was
at the top of the ridge of rocks they headed
toward the side of the canyon that was farthest
from the spot where the capture had been made
it was very little noise they made too which
showed that they did not want the bovs com-
panion to know which way they went

  after they once bound him wild did not make
any struggles whatever so many times had he
been placed in similar plights that he well knew
how useless it would be to do so as the vil-
lains reached the other side of the canyon they
descended by way of a narrow path to an open
spot that lay beneath a wide overhanging ledge
pay rpck their horses were here tied to
jutting points of rock ready for them the man
who was evidently the captain of the band caused
the boy to be placed on the horse with him wild
was handled rather roughly and he was soon
hanging over the pommel of the saddle as though
he had been but a sack of grain but he never
once kicked or struggled and the outlaw captain
seemed to be pleased at this

  had the boy acted in a contrary way he would
havo given the villain no end of trouble but
that was not our heros way of doing business
he knew he had been caught napping and now
young wild west

lie was simply trying to think of a way to outwit
them and make his escape he knew very well
that cheyenne charlie and jim dart would find
where he had been taken no matter if it took
them considerable time to do it when the out-
laws had al mounted they rode along through
the canyon taking care to keep behind a low
ridge of rocks that ran along close to the right
side of it

  not until they were fully half a mile from the
spot where the capture had been made did they
put their horses at a gallop then they rode
swiftly onward heading this way and that which
showed how well they knew the ground they were
traveling and when a little over ten miles had
been covered they made a sharp turn and en-
tered a passage that ran back under the earth
itself in less than a minute they were in total
darkness and then wild knew that he was be-
ing taken to the hiding place of the outlaws that
infested death canyon

chapter v-following the trail

  the girls and the prospector were perhaps
twenty feet from the commencement of the de-
file with the chinaman but charlie and jim were
standing right in it when they heard young wild
wests warning cry all hands knew right away
that the boy had been trapped the scout acted
as though lie was going to rush through but jim
quickly caught him by the shoulder

  dont he whispered well stand a better
chance if we keep still and watch and listen
they have not killed him that we know or lie
would not have been able to cry out what we
want to do now is to get around somewhere so
we can see whats going on

  right yer are jim retorted charlie giving
in to the boy at once

  the two at once started back to where the rest
of the party was in waiting and they were just
in time to see arietta starting to climb a pile
of rocks something had told the brave girl
that the danger that had overtaken her dashing
young lover must have come from above and
acting on an impulse she started to go upward
seeing that she was bent upon doing this jim
dart mounted his horse and quickly rode around
to the right meanwhile arietta went  up-
ward climbing with more ease than the average
girl could have done

  but that was nothing for her she had been
born and reared in the wild west and she was
used to roughing it climbing rocks was but
mere play to her up she went and in less than
two minutes she was at the top of the ridge but
the villains had done their work quickly and well
and they were just leaving the spot as she got
within sight of them the moment she saw them
she felt that she had succeeded and she knew
that they were not going to get away with wild
without her knowing which way they went she
paused long enough to lean over the top of the
rocks and motioned to those below so they would
know that she had made a discovery thfn she
started along after the masked gang she saw
the helpless form of her dashing young lover as
he was being carried bodily along the ridge and

in death canyon	

once or twice she was tempted to open fire c the
outlaws but she knew very well that she could
hardly hope to rescue him in that way it was
better to follow them and see where they went
then she could come back and report and plans
could be made to effect the rescue of wild on
went the brave girl keeping as close to them as
she dared and it was not long before she saw
them reach their horses that were in waiting
under the overhanging ledge then it was that
the girl was taken with the fear that they might
be able to elude her when she saw wild placed
upon the horse with the leader of the outlaws
she knew it would be very difficult for her to keep
within sight of them very long but there was
nothing to do but to go ahead now

  if she turned back they would sux-ely get away
rnd she would have no knowledge of where they
went when she found that they were keeping
their horses at a walk she felt a little better as
they started to ride away the girl crept to the
top of the rock and tossed her hat to the ground
below this would show charlie and jim if they
rode up that way that she had gone that way
and they might be able to find a means of get-
ting to the top of the ridge with their horses
if they could not do this they would have to go
around and try it fiom the other side arietta
took the trail and followed it with the caution
ox an indian scout

  it was not hard to keep up with the walk of
the horses but when the outlaws started away at
a gallop she was soon left behind she was now
in a quandary but when she looked at the
ground and saw that the fx-esh hoof prints show-
ed plainly she was a little encoux-aged

  i must go back and get the rest up here in
some way with the horses she thought then
we will follow the trail and wild will surely be
saved

  looking around carefully she was not long in
finding a way to get down to the so-called level
ground at the bottom of the canyon but she
was on the opposite passage to that fx-oin which
she had ascended after thinking a moment she
decided to go back the same way she had come
and then let her friends know the way to get to
the trail with the horses back she went and
although the distance was over half a mile she
soon made it when she saw them all waiting
at nearly the same place she had left them at
the girl was delighted

  running forward along the ridge she reached
a point from which she could attract their atten-
tion and when she saw jinx dart holding her hat
whicli she had thrown down in his hand she
knew they had been baffled and were no doubt
sorely puzzled

  hello she called out loud enough for them
to hear her

  they all heard her and the next minute ari-
etta was telling them just what to do then
cheyenne charlie mounted his horse and led the
way through the defile arietta ran along then
iit a little distance and found she could look over
and see them she also knew that they migt
make a short cut to the trail she had been fol-
lowing so she was not long in discovering a
means to get down hem then she mounted
her horse and took charge of spitfire keeping n
light hold upon the br die-rein the sorrel


young wild west in death canyon

might not get frightened at being without a rider
and try to run away

  they all rode on the two chinamen bringing
up the rear as usual anna and eloise had lit-
tle or nothing to say-none of them did just then
it seemed they were all wondering what had
become of dashing young wild west after
what seemed a rather long time they came to
the trail that led along close to the side of the
canyon the hoofprints showed plainly and
when he saw them the scout gave a nod of satis-
faction

  if ther galoots think they kin fool us theyre
mighty much mistaken he declared they
think they have got wild an that they kin hold
him a prisoner an then force us ter give up a
pile of money fur him maybe eut jest wait
ill git ter ther place theyve gone ter an there
wont be no mistake about it either

  lat light misler charlie me go too so be
spoke up hop who was close enough to hear ev-
erything the scout said

  all right hop when i need your help which
most likely t will ill let yer know

  and i will have something to say too when
the time comes arietta put in

  sartin charlie answered of course i
know that your judgment is always mighty good
arietta

  they all knew this quite well they also knew
that when the girl made up her mind to pursue
a certain course when wild was missing and
probably in great danger she would not listen to
any one but did as she thought best they con-
tinued alone- the trail riding as fast as the park
horses could go in some places the hoofnrints
could not be seen owing to the hard ground but
for the most part there was enough sand to
leave the impressions

  when they had covered a few miles and saw
that the tracks were leading them right on
through the canvon they began to think that it
must be that the outlaws were located some-
where close to the mining camp it was getting
well toward noon and tbat meant that the out-
laws must have carried wild a long way

  is this ther regular trail that goes through
ther canyon muller charlie asked the pros-
pector when he began to grow uneasy over their
delay in finding the boy

  it is not the one that is used by regular trav-
elers was the reply i never knew there was
such a smooth way along here this trail is as
new to me as it is to you

  well that sorter accounts fur ther outlaws
havin their own way in death canyon then i
spose theyve got places here an there where
they git over to ther regular trail this is their
own trail i reckon they must feel that they own
it in fact

  most likely they do jim dart answered
men like them sometimes get the idea in their
heads that they own the whole earth

  they kin think that way if they want ter if
they only jest keep wild a prisoner an dont
take a notion ter do any harm ter him thats all
i ask well have him away from em afore it
gits dark an ill liet on it

  the prospector acted as though he hardly be-
lieved this hut he made no comment it hap-
pened that the spot where the outlaws had en-

tered the passage with our helpless young hero
was  well surrounded by rocks there were
openings here and there which horses might go
through and probably get to the trail that ran
through the central part of the canyon no doubt
but it was the sort of a place that would be apt
to make a stranger there get all mixed up so
to speak

   no matter which way one might look there
was a sameness to it all save that the steep side
of the canyon was-the same all through to
make matters all the mole puzzling there was
nothing but the hard rock to walk or ride upon
and this made it impossible for footprints or
even hoof marks to show it was at this point
that our friends came to a halt they all felt
that they had about reached the end of the trail
for muller declared that it was not more than
seven miles to the mining camp that was situ-
e rnouth of the canyon
t -aid cheyenne charlie as he dismount-
ed i reckon somethin has got ter he done now
i l  knes that were mighty close ter
ther place them galoots took wild dont nobody
make any noise jim spose me an you go
around on foot if arietta is willing

    i am willing the girl answered quickly go
on a j	to do anything i will try

   and if missy alietta no findee misler wild
len me takee lookee lound declared hop

   the scout and dart quickly dismounted and
then the rest followed suit

    come on jim said charlie i reckon well
find out somethin afore very long

    think so charlie was the reply

    without another word the two set out to make
a search among the rock keeping as close as
they could to the steep inside of the canyon ari-
etta watched them until thev were lost to view
and then she nodded to hop and said

    i guess well start out too hop there is no
i tv waitn- i fear wild is in great danger
and the quicker we find him the better it will

maivprepljht missy aietta  the china-

war tl 	  hav tackled em when they

kin rutnn tfi wtgwid west an pards
reirment r hats	equal ter a whole

   ment there aint no mistake about that
young wild west

ther bov is ther champion deadshot of ther
west an his pards kin shoot purty nigh as
straight as he kin we sartinly done a nice job
when we laid that trap for him though i didn t
think we was hardly goin ter git him

  well buddy we did git him anyhow i was
goin ter kill him right away but sich a galoot
as he is aint deservin of no easy death ever
since hes been big enough ter hold a gun out
straight hes been botherin sich men as we are
hes been mighty lucky too but all ropes has
to come ter an end you know young w nd w e-t
has reached ther end of his

  then they all began to talk and as wild lis-
tened to their conversation he could easily tell
how delighted they were at having made him a
prisoner reaching the end of the passage they
entered a broad roomy cave it was of natural
formation of course and the rocky earth was
supported at regular intervals by huge boulders
and stone some of them looking to be almost as
if they had been cut out by the hand of man

  a rift in the rock overhead admitted light
enough for them to see all through the cavern-
ous place and off to the left was what might
have been called a series of apartments some of
them being almost square in shape wild took
in all this a he was carried along manv times
had he seen such places hut he was willing to
admit just then that this seemed to be one of
the caves that might be called puzzlers it was
a ragged network so it seemed the villains
reached that portion of the underground place
they used as a stall for the horses then they
dismounted and the boy prisoner was allowed to
drop to the rockv floor if such it could be called
having been so long in one position with his
head hanging down this was a great relief to
wid he rolled over and then assumed a sitting
posture

  he watched every move the villains made but
not until they had taken care of their horses did
the villains turn their attention to him then the
man who had been called buddy took him by the
arms and lifted him to his feet at the same time
severing the bonds that bound his ankles to-
gether

  i reckon yer kin walk you young galoot
he exclaimed savagely it aint likely that you
will have to do much more walkin but there
aint no use in makin us carry yer the little
ways you have got to go now when you come
in here it was ther last sight of the outside world
you will ever git jest think about that maybe
itll make you feel good

  fetch him on in here buddy called out the
captain as he removed his mask and placed it in
his pocket as soon as we have had the chance
to git a drink an light up our pipe well give him
ther opportunity to talk a little id jest like ter
know what he has got ter bay for i know hes
got a mighty good opinion of us he aint never
been ketched by sich a clever crowd as we are

i reckon

  there was a laugh at this remark for no doubt
it sounded rather humorous to the seven villains
wild acted ns though he was not paying a par-
ticle of attention to what they said but really he
was doing some pretty hard thinking just then
though his limbs were stiffened from having
been tied so tightly he managed to walk and he

in death canyon	

did so willingly around an angle of rock he was
conducted and a few feet farther brought him to
the main part of the cave which was occupied
as a living quarters by the outlaw that they
must have been there for some little time wa-
evident as the place was fitted up with all the
comforts that might be found in the shanty of a
mining camp there were even pictures on the
walls most of them being rough prints and litho-
graph-

  oil lamps hung from the rugged ceiling of
rock and across one end of the apartment was
a long table which was already set with tin plates
and cups showing that the cook had arranged
everything in that line before leaving the cave
that morning at one end of the apartment there
was a sort of natural fireplace and a heap of
ashes lay near it as wild looked at this he
could easily guess that the draught carried the
smoke up a sort of chute on the side opposite
to the table was a row of bunks a few chairs
such as are to be found in a tavern or shanty
saloon were lined up on either side of the table
while a long bench close to the only fireplace was
in evidence wild was conducted to one of the
chair and as he sat down captain harvey as
the leader had been called by one of his men
faced him and said

  now then young wild west i reckon ill give
yer a chance ter talk but afore i do ill have a
little drink bill jest fetch out one of them
jugs

  all right cap answered the man addressed
and then the captain cut the thong which held
the pair in the boys mouth

  wild could not help breathing a sigh of relief
for it hd nearly choked him

  i reckon i feel a little better he observed
coollv now then if you will just cut my
hands loose i wouldnt mind it so much

  oh you neednt think were afraid ter cut
your hands loose young wild west was the
retort but i aint goin ter do that jest now
what do you think of our headquarters any-
how

  well it couldnt be a much better place fur
such headquarters as you to occupy and the
boy looked over the room in a critical way

  yer think so eh well that shows youre a
purty good jedge but you dont seem ter sorter
realize that you aint never goin ter git out of
here alive

  oh thats all right im not worrying sbout
tlat ive been in places of this kind before
ive had lots of dealings with such galoots as you
are you cant scare me so you can go ahead
and say anything you like you got the best of
me all right but my turn will come pretty -oon
im not worrying in the least

  youre a mighty good sort of a galoot i
reckon and the captain looked at him in a way
that told that he was not a little surprised i
never met yer afore but theres some of my men
as lias seen yer and theyve told me a whole lot
about yer if they hadnt told yer was sich a
wonderful shot an was sich a mighty cool hand
i wouldnt have took ther trouble ter fetch yer
all ther way here instead of roping you i
would have shot yer dead but im somethin
like an injun i always admire an enemy what
dont show fear itll do me all ther more good


young wild west in death canyon

ter kill yer when ther time comes of course
you know it wouldnt be safe for us to let you
git out of here no matter what kind of a prom-
ise we got from you you aint got money
enough nor none of your friends aint to buy
your freedom you have got to die an thats
all there is ter it

  i know i have got to die the young dead-
shot answered calmly as he looked the villain
squarely in the eyes that is something i am
certain of but when it comes to dying very
soon i dont believe i will what you say does
not amount to anything you darenot kill me
and you know it if you were to do it you
would be hunted until you were caught and then
you know what you would get there would be
enough men after you to clean up your band in
short order and death canyon would be fdled
with them in spite of the mysterious- happenings
that have been reported here dont think you
are fooling with just an ordinary bov for you
are not i am too well known and have the
hacking of the united states government too
no i am not a bit afraid of being killed by
you

  the boys words had more than ordinary effect
on the captain and his men some of the villains
looked at each other and shrugged their shoul-
ders just as though they did not know just what
to take from it wild was quick to notice this

  i want you to know that i did not come here
for the purpose of interfering with any gang of
outlaws for i did not know there was any here 
he went on i just happened along here with
my friends and meeting a prospector who told
us it was dangerous to come this way we de-
cided to come anyway we are always looking
for excitement and adventure and that is the
reason he told us there was some sort of mys-
terious man here who was known to run around
among the rocks with a human skull supposed
to be that of his latest victim in his hands but
if you are going to keep me here a prisoner i
suppose i will be delayed a few hours in seeing
him

  there was a short silence after our hero ceased
speaking the outlaws exchanged glances and
showed signs of uneasiness too

  ther feller didnt tell yer that ther galoot
what goes around with ther skull i called ther
mod miner then said captain harvey after a
while

  no he didnt say that he didnt know i
reckon

  well we know dont we boys

  yes came the ouick reply from three or
four of them while the rest nodded

  an he wont raise ructions around through
death car von very long not if we once git hold
of hm hes proved that he cant he dropped by
a bullet but maybe if we got hold of him once
wod soon fix him hes done enough damage to
our business weve lost since hes scared folks
from cornin through this way why ther stage-
coach dont go through no more theyve give
up ther route entirely an now ther people in
bag flat has ter git their supplies up from
prescott with a three days drive of it no
sir-ree ther mad miner aint no good ter us

  wild took this in with no little interest ho

was looking for information and he certainly
was getting it

  so the mad miner cant be shot eh he ask-
ed after waiting a few seconds and acting as
though he never thought he was in the least bit
of danger

  it sorter seems that way captain harvey
answered but see here young wild west i
reckon you aint no visitor here you was brought
here ter be put out of ther way after id settled
on ther way ter do it

  oh thats so but didnt i just tell you that
you dared not put me out of the way you
know that as well as i do you made a big mis-
take in bringing me here if you had shot me
down when you had the chance you might have
stood a chance of getting awav but now it is
different

  i cant see how it is any different retorted
the outlaw leader what makes ther differ-
ence

  well i dont know as i will tell you that you
should know that much

  xe what nakes ther difference
help ju suppose friends have gone for

   wouwnt they have done that if wed shot
yer

  no for if you had shot me it is most likely
you would have shot the rest of them though you
might have spared the girls they would not
know what to do so there would really have been
no one to hunt you down
stumped the captain

  blamed if there aint somethin in that he
exclaimed but never mind that youve got
ter die anyhow i dont care if ther whole army
gits after me ive heard so much about you
oung wild west that ive jest made up my
mind that youre too dangerous a customer ter
live i wouldnt let yer ffo not fur ther promise
of a million dollars

  all right you can do as you please about it
ut just remember that you cant frighten me i
anat that sort of a fellow

  wild was bluffing hard and he knev he had
made good headway in the game which was really
one for life or death it was now near the hour
or noon the outlaws set about to getting some-
i infjeadyt eat- wild sat on the chair watch-
ner them his hands still tied securely behind him

  e watched what they were doing never once
showing the least sign of fear no matter what
ghts ere- he llifl not mean to let them
know them an hour passed the outlaws ate
iner noonday meal and then lighted their pipes
thji  ea-v- captain harvey walked over to
ntl t naptlyi as though he meant to have an-

jmaik wth him but -ust then a fteniish

tl  rans out from some part of the big cave

knew that the mad miner was close at hand

tion that charlie and jim had taken but arietta
had an idea that it was going to be quite a task
to find the hiding place of the outlaws and she
figured that the more there were searching the
quicker it would be done hop kept right along
close behind her leaving it to her to lead the
way for over ten minutes they searched about
among the rocks following every little asage
that showed itself only to eventually find them-
selves back where they had started from but
at length hop clambered upon a rock when he
found the passage they had been following came
to an abrupt end and once up there he got sight
of something that made his eye- open wide it
was nothing more than the open space that ran to
the passage the outlaws had gone through with
their prisoner something like half an hour before
he quickly turned and leaning over the rock
whispered

  me findee allee light missee alietta you
comee light up here so be me showee you

  the girls heart gave a bound it was no diffi-
cult task for her to climb upon the rock and the
moment she got there she knew that the china-
man had spoken the truth not only did she see
the mouth of the passage but she could also see
the prints of horses hoofs

  come on down she said in a very low tone
of voice it wont be very long before we find
wild now hop

  lat whatee me tlinkee so be replied the
clever chinaman as he slid down to the level be-
low

  arietta was there almost as quickly as he was
and then cautioning her companion to be very
careful and not to make any noise she started
boldly for the passage they proceeded through
it until it got so dark that they could not see
where to go or which way it led then they came
to a pause both listened intently but could hear
nothing that would indicate that there was any-
thing in the line of human being in the under-
ground place then hop struck a match the
flame lighted the passage for a short distance but
seeing that it went out and that there were no
obstacles in the way the chinaman started boldly
forward

  he kept right on going with arietta close at
his heels until the match went out he had
plenty of them with him so he quickly struck
another in this way they kept on until they saw
the faint light on ahead then they again paused
confident that they had struck the right place
arietta tried to think of something to do she
had brought her rifle with her and carried the
regular weapons that were always upon her when
traveling so she felt that in case they got in a
tight place she would be able to put up a pretty
good defense

  but if it happened that the outlaws were ex-
pecting any one to come there and search for
wild that would be another thing then it might
be that they would fail into a trap arietta was
not a little worried but hop appeared to be very
calm the fact was that the chinaman figured
that even if he did get into the hands of the vil-
lains he would be able to find a way to get the
best of them through his ability to perform fea-
of magic as we have already stated there were

in death canyon	

many passages and natural chambers in the back
cavern that were formed of rock

  this made it almost impossible for the two to
strike the particular place where the outlaws
made their headquarters at the first time after
waiting a few minutes and not hearing anything
they started on through the passage but it just
happened that they took a direction that was al-
most contrary to the one they should have gone
and after walking perhaps a full hundred yards
they suddenly came to an outlet it was on a
narrow ledge projected out for several feet as
nothing could be seen of those they had left the
other side of the rocks the possibility was that
they might be right under them for they both
knew that they had walked up quite an ascent
since they entered the passage

  we no findee here missee alietta said hop
in a whisper we go lookee somewhere else so
be

  thats right the girl replied shaking her
head the cave inside there is a regular honey-
comb of passages and it is hard to tell which way
to go

  we keepee on tly len maybe pletty soonee we
hear somebody talkee and len we be allee light

  thats right hop be very careful and dont
make any noise

  after looking up and down the canyon and not
seeing a sign of a human being the two re-en-
tered the passage and made their way downward
again though there was light enough admitted
through a big rift overhead they could not find
the passage they had come through on entering
the cave though they looked for it fully twenty
minutes but there were several passages that
branched from them mostly to the right and
choosing one of these the brave girl told the
chinaman to come on they had not gone very
far before they found that they were again as-
cending a rise but the passage seemed to be a
rather broad one and it struck arietta that it
might possibly lead them to the spot they were
so anxious to find up they went winding this
way and that

  they were really nearing the top of the back
cave and they could now see where the light came
in a wide crack stretched across the natural
rift in a zig-zag form and through this the sun
was shining brightly lighting up the place and
really making it look more lonesome than it
might otherwise have appeared for the curiously
formed rocks stood out in bold relief but it was
little attention that they paid to what they saw
pushing on they soon came to a crevice ihat
opened right up at their feet as they looked
down into this they found that it ran at an angle
of about forty-five degrees and seemed to be
smooth and slippery hop dropped upon his
hands so he might get a good look below him
it was just then that a weird fiendish shriek
echoed through the underground place the
chinaman was so startled that he involuntarily
made a move to rise in a hurry

  but in doing this his hand slipped and then over
he went shooting down through the crevice like a
shot arietta was dum founded she heard one
gasping choking cry followed by a rattling of
loosened stone and dirt and then all was still
the awful shriek had frightened her not a little


young wild west in death canyon

and then to have hop fall down into the opening
in that way was quite enough to fill the girl with
fear and alarm as she sat there undecided what
to do and trying hard to collect her senses a foot-
fal sounded behind her turning quickly she be-
held cheyenne charlie and jim dart approach-
ing

   like arietta and hop the two had got lost in
the mazes of the big cavern neither of them
acted surprised when they saw the girl standing
here alone they had both heard the unearthly
shriek and as they had no knowledge that would
give them a clue to the person who had uttered it
 they were not a little disturbed the pale face
of arietta as it was turned toward them made
them feel more uneasy than ever

oh she exclaimed  am so glad you have
come hop just slipped and tumbled down there
when charlie and jim saw her pointing to the
crevices they then knew that she had something
more than the cry to be alarmed about

  great gimlets exclaimed the scout ther
heathen fell down there did he well thats
mighty bad i reckon did yer hear that awful
yell arietta 

   yes that is what made hop slip and fall he
was leaning over trying to look down just as the
cry rang through the cavern when he tried to
get up quickly his hand must have slipped and
then down he went all i heard from him was a
choking cry i fear he has been killed

  maybe not hop is a mighty lucky heathen
hes got more lives than a cat dont think that
arietta but by ginger things is gittin worse
instead of better i reckon muller told ther truth
when he said there was mysterious things happen-
in death canyon that yell sounded like ther
wail of a lost soul or somethin like that id
almost bet it wasnt no human what made it

   i reckon it came from the lips of a human be-
ing all right spoke up jim dart who had about
recovered himself by this time we mustnt be
surprised at anything re see or hear here we
have got too much on hand to let such things in-
terfere with us for that

  sartin and the scout brightened up right
away weve got ter save wild an weve got
ter find hop come on well git at it right
away

   charlie had brought a long lariat with him for
he never negccted to go well provided when he set
out on such an errand as had brought him to the
cave there was no telling just when a rope
might come in handy they nil knew that they
must attend to hop first for he might be wedged
in somewhee below bruised and dying or per-
haps dead

  we must not cry out said jim so you can
lower me down charlie

   right yer are jim was the reply while ari-
etta gave  nod of assent

  though all three expected to hear that awful
rhriek ring out again at any moment it did not
come dart quickly tied the rope under his arms
and then he slipped over the edge of the opening
charlie lowering him down carefully there was
a draught drawing d jw rvard and as he went on
down dust biew upon him aad almost choked and
blinded him

  no wonder hop did not cry out much he
thought this is quite enough to make a fellow
keep his mouth closed

  down he went and when about a distance of
sixty feet had been descended the bottom of the
natural shaft was reached the dust was still
flying around him as the draught pulled it
through but jim gave a pull on the rope which
meant that everything was all right so far and
then waited until he could get a chance to see
where he was in less than a minute the dust
was cleared away and then the boy looked around
him and found a level piece of rocky floor an
opening before him showed that he had simply
come down to a place they had passed through on
entering the cave

  well he muttered i reckon hop did not get
hurt much in coming down here he is worth a
dozen dead chinamen yet and the chances are
that he will do something to distinguish himself
before very long if he happens to run across the
galoot who let out that yell and sees him first
there will be something happening and ill bet
on it

  jim coolly gave the signal to be drawn up it
was two sharp pulls on the rope and understand-
ing it at once the scout got to work jim had to
keep his eyes and mouth closed the same as he
had done in going down the dust was very thick
m the chute no doubt it had been accumulating
there for years when the boy was pulled over
the edge of the opening he breathed a sigh of re-
lief

  did yer find him jim asked charlie in a
whisper

  no was the reply but i soon got satisfied
that he never got hurt any he must have gone
on to look for wild that chute leads right down
to a place that looks like the one we were in after
we found the way through the passage from the
outside i believe it is too for we have done con-
siderable climbing and we must certainly have
been going about in a circle

a	very glai hop lid not hurt himself

arietta spoke up the fact that he was not
here when you got down is proof that he must be
all right	k

  thats right arietta nodded dart now
we will continue the search for wild

boy drew forth the pocket compass he al-
 and then lie selected the direction
they must keep to according to his way of think-

lv	cou not et up here so it is not like-

iwiov  tlawa are as high as this either he

    i cme  we will strike something
shortly i feel sure

  hoping for the best the three retrace their
steps arietta had come by the shortest route so
she wasi able to help out jim and the scout not a
little in a very few minutes they were back to
he entrance of the dark pasasge that led out into
w-if anyon as they paused there undecided just
	r ext a leavy report rang out then

of terror sounded and our three friends

vjt i ihc amc persn who had uttered the
     shriek was responsible for il
young wild west

  chapter viii-what happened to hop

  as the weird shriek resounded through the cav-
ernous place young wild west remained perfectly
still and watched the faces of the villains he
could see that they were a superstitious lot and
that they were mortally afraid of the person who
had uttered it the fact that the captain of the
outlaws had told him about the mad miner made
it quite plain to the boy and he was not the least
bit disturbed at what he had heard

  whats the matter with you galoots he
asked coolly after waiting for a few seconds and
not hearing any further sounds i thought you
were so anxious to get hold of the mad miner
why dont you go and ret him i take it that it
was he who let out that yell just then

  that was him sure enough retorted captain
harvey its all right for you to set there and
ask us why we dont go an git him young wild
west but i reckon if you knowed as much about
him as we do you wouldnt feel very anxious
about goin ter git him after hearing that yell of
his that galoot aint human an thats all there
is to it

   oh i guess hes human all right the boy an-
swered in his cool and easy way why dont
vou own up to it and say that you are afraid of
him you have already said that bullets dont
have any effect on him why dont ou go and
catch him if hes such a terribe fiend as i have
heard he should not be running around loose
according to what i have heard said his victims
have been many and that he uses the skull of
every fresh one he gets to wave over his head and
frighten those he comes across ill bet all im
worth that ill find out who and what he is be-
fore i quit this part of the country

  you wont find out anything young wild
west was the quick retort you aint never
goin ter git out of here so that settles it i
aint goin ter kill you jest now cause i wan ter
wait till ther mad miner gits away from here
he dont generally stay around here very long
he jest comes around here now and then ter scare
us i reckon

  well if he does come for that im quite cer-
tain that he succeeds all right why some of
you galoots are trembling in your boots even now
youre even afraid of the mans voice

  the outlaws acted as though they were ashamed
of themselves as they heard this from the boy
who was taking the whole thing so coolly though
a prisoner and helpless at that our hero was
now pretty well satisfied that there was little dan-
ger of his being harnftd much less killed if it
so happened that his friends could not find where
he was he might suffer death but that would be
only when the captain of the band could pluck up
enough courage to do it

  why dont some of you go and look for the
mai minor he asked when he fcund that none
of the men were making a move to leave the spot
go and catch him and bring him here id like
to see v hat he looks like

  this was quite enough to make a couple of
them muster up sufficient courage to leave the
headquarters

  well go out and see where he is all right

in death canyon	

one of them said as he drew a revolver and
moved away toward the main passage that led
through the underground place

  dont try to use your revolver advised wild
the captain says that bullets dont have any ef-
fect on the galoot take a rope i think that will
be better

  the sarcastic way in which the prisoner spoke
nettled the villains considerably the fact was
that they were beginning to think that he was one
of the sort who do not know what fear is and
as the reader knows they were pretty nearly
right but when he did fear within his breast
wild was not the one to show it the two men
came back anl took seats at the table our hero
laughed

  maybe the mad miner will come in so i can
get a look at him since you fellows wont go out
and hunt him up he observed

  he wont come in here answered the captain
quickly he knows better than that

  the words were scarcely out of his mouth when
a light footfall sounded close at hand instantly
all eyes were turned in the direction it came
from then it was that the faces of the villains
turned paler than ever for right before them
stood the very person they had been talking about
a tall man with a bearded face and staring eyes
was standing there looking at them in a way that
might have been called fierce though as wild took
a cood look at him he decided that the man real-
ly was looking at nothing in particular that in
fact his mind was o far unbalanced that he
really knew not what he was doing

  his attire was about like that of the ordinary
miner or prospector remaining silent for the
space of probably half a minute the mad miner
as we must call him drew from behind his back
where his hand had been l-esting a human skull
as the gruesome thing was held before the eyes
of the outlaws they involuntarily drew back
against the long table leaving wild sitting alone
within twenty feet of the uncanny visitor
though his hands were tied behind him the boy
had the use of his feet a sudden resolve came
into his mind

  ill take my chances with the mad miner he
thought if  can manage to look him in the
eyes for a second or two i think i will he able
to make him cut my hands loose then i will show
these galoots how quickly ill get out of here

  wild turned his gaze squarely upon that of the
mad miner and in a very few seconds he found
him looking straight at him then it was that
he arose and walked straight to him the mad
man never moved a step nor did he lower the
hand that held the skull

  cut me loose said wild in a low but com-
manding voice do as i say

  the man gave a start and then the expression
of his eyes softened as if by magic without a
moments delay his left hand slipped to his belt
and drew forth a knife wild stepped closei- and
then the rope that held his wrists together was
severed

  much obliged to you he exclaimed and then
waving his hand defiantly at the villains he dart-
ejl from the place

  so well had he watched when he was brought
to the hidden headquarters that he knew just th


young wild west in death canyon

way to go and before the astonished villains
scarcely realized it he was heading for the dark
passage reaching it he kept right on running
though he slackened his pace somewhat for fear
of running into some obstacle on went wild and
the next minute he was outside in the canyon it
was easy for him to tell the way they had come
so he lost no time in taking direction that he
hoped would lead him to within sight of his com-
panions for he knew they must certainly be
-somewhere in the vicinity by this timo as he
got out upon a comparatively level spot that lay
between the high piles of rock a heavy report
sounded from within the cavernous place the boy
stopped instantly he knew very well it was no
rifle or revolver that had made the report it
sounded more like one of the big firecrackers that
hop wah always carried with him it was only
natural that he should think right away that the
chinaman had found his way into the cave and
that he had got into some trouble and was com-
pelled to explode one of the crackers in order to
save himself

  by jingo he exclaimed can it be that hop
is in there if thats the case the rest must be
around here somewhere

  he quickly started to climb a rocky elevation
so that he might look around him before he
reached the top of it he crave an exclamation of
delight for less than fifty yards from him he
saw anna eloise the prospector and wing
standing in a group near the horses he raised a
little higher and waved his hat and the result was
that he was seen by them then he motioned for
them to keep silent and quickly started for them
over the rocks he went with the agility of a
mountain goat and in a couple of minutes he had
reached them

  im so glad to see you i dont know what to
say exclaimed harry muller charlie and jim
and arietta and hop went to look for you didnt
you see anything of them

  no answered our hero but i reckon i just
heard something of hop ill bet he set off a fire-
cracker in that cave back there for i can tell by
the sound

  then he must be in trouble cried anna her
face paling arietta went with him too

  well i got away from the outlaws but ill go
right back there declared the dnshinsr young
deadshot as he went over to one of the pack-
horses and quickly possessed himself of a pair of
revolvers that were carried among the supplies

  though the outlaws had taken his weapons
from him they had not bothered with his car-
tridges he quickly loaded the two weapons and
then possessing himself of a hunting knife he
turned to those who had been waiting there and
said

   stay right here where you are till i come back
dont get frightened if you see a crazy man run-
ning around with a human skull in his hand he
is called the mad miner so i learned from the
outlaws they are mortally afraid of him and so
are lots of people from what i can hear take it
easy muller and dont go to shooting at the mad
miner if you should happen to see him but if
you should happen to see any of the outlaws jut
take mighty good aim and let them have it i

hardly think they will come out just now
though

  without saying anything further will started
back for the cave he knew the way so well now
that it did not take him long to reach it though
he had to do considerable climbing over the rocks
to get there without bothering to light a match
he pushed on through the passage and soon came
to where the light of day showed at the other end
he was not much surprised when he heard the
voice of hop raised in protest stealthily wild
made his way atong and soon he was right near
the rocky chamber he had escaped from a sin-
gle glance told him that the mad miner had taken
his departure the voice of hop could no longer
be heard but the outlaws were talking in very low
tones there sat hop upon the table the outlaws
gathered about him each holding a revolver in his
hand the clever chinaman was doing his best
to take it coolly as our hero vatched him hop
calmly took a cigar from his pocket and then he
brought forth a match safe and struck one of the
contents as he lighted the cigar the villains
standing before him gradually lowered their re-
volvers our hero smiled in spite of himself

  i reckon that heathen is certainly a cool one
he thought the galoots are certainly meeting
with people who dont show fear anyhow well
thats the way to handle such villains

  as hop got the cigar going to his satisfaction
he smiled at the rough-looking men before him
and then said

  well whatee you do about it me comee long
and see um man holdee uppee um skull and lookee
yelly muchee likee mad me touchee off um fire-
cracker and me makee him lun allee samee velly
muchee fastee len you comee aud catchee me
me velly goodee chinee so be

n you say be a ver pood chinee answered
captain harvey jbut i happen to know that yer
belong ter young wild wests gang we had
 oung  ild west here a little while ago and if
rnat galoot of a mad miner had not come along
and interfered i reckon we would have him here
yet but well git him agin an i reckon well
keep you here too

         just then tbat wild became conscious
tnat there was some one near him turning slow-
y and moving the hand that held the revolver
iiunr-i e same time he saw no less a person
knryene arlie creeping toward him the
 - relieved when he saw the scout and as
a	recognition was surprised to

 more forms come creeping close behind
mm they were arietta aid jim dart this was
to lae the boy feel in a very hap-
p frame of mind the only one of the party who
f p just now was hop and after all
fii-v be sail hat it was real danger
k ifevvw ndoubt n the mind of our hero
fni a means of escaping from
 luins vthout an assistance arietta crept
up to the side of her dashing young lover and

squeezed	atisfaction of having her hand

  do you know the way out the boy asked

   -ves- was the reply
  i hen you go on out charlie and jim will wait
young wild west

in death canyon



here with me until we get hop free from the ga-
loots said the boy

  arietta started boldly for the passage for she
surely krew the way the girl had scarcely dis-
appeared from view when hop did something that
treated the villains to another surprise just how
he managed to do it even our friends could not
see and they were watching closely in some
way he managed to light the fuse of one of the
big homemade firecrackers he carried and let it
fall under the table bang as the explosion
ran out tlse clever chinaman leaped right over
the heads of the astonished outlaws and made a
bolt for the passage he almost fell over wild
and his partners for they had not time to get
out of the way as they quickly got upon their
feet the voice of arietta rang out in a wild cry
for help and then it was that the weird un-
earthly shriek of the mad miner echoed through
the underground place again

chapter ix-a baffling search

  hop had been nearly choked by the dust when
he went headlong down the natural chute but as
jim dart had said he was not hurt it was mere-
ly a shaking up that he received so he was not
long in scrambling to his feet and recovering
from his surprise

  me allee samee comee down pletty quickee
he muttered under his breath but whattee
makee lat velly bad noisee soundee allee samee
likee um ghostee so be

  he knew it would not be advisable to call out
to arietta as that would simply be the means of
letting the enemy know there was some one there
who diii not belong there hop started to find a
way to get back to the girl but he became a little
confused somehow and the result was that he
came to the big chamber that was occupied by
the outlaws if he had come there about a min-
ute sooner lie woud havle seen wild making his
escape as it was he heard the sounds of the
boys footsteps but he had no idea who was flee-
ing from the spot

  hop did not see the villains inside the rocky
chamber but he did see the mad miner who had
not moved a foot from the sjiot he had been
standing upon when he cut our heros bonds the
clever chinaman looked the man over as well as
he could for he could not see his face when he
saw that he was holding a skull over his head in
such a peculiar way it occurred to him that it
would be a good idea to give him a surprise hop
had heard the prospector tell about the mysteri-
ous man who went about carrying the skulls of
his victims and he promptly set the fellow down
as being the identical man but there was noth-
ing so very mysterious about him as far as hop
could see and he even grinned when he thought
what lie was going to do

  um velly muchee mystelious man so be he
thought he makee scare maybe he goitre gold
minee lound here somewhere and he cally um
skull alound so he allee samee scare um people
way me velly soonee make him jumpee

the chinaman was now quite cool he was in

no particular hurry either so he went carefully
at what he proposed to do first he took from
one of the many pockets of his loose-fitting coat
a clumsy-looking object that was probably five or
six inches in length this was nothing more or
less than a firecracker and a powerful one at
that hop claimed to have worked in a factory
where fireworks were made before leaving china
and whether he did or not he certanily knew
something about their manufacture next he
brought out a match which was one of the kind
that can be struck without making a sound the
chinaman was less than a dozen feet from the
mad miner when he was ready to give him the
surprise he coolly struck the match and then he
applied the flame to the fuse

  this done he rolled the cracker along the
ground toward the unsuspecting madman who
was holding the outlaws at bay the cracker
stopped within a few inches of the mans heels

then there was a quick sputter and then-

bang the report was a heavy one and the mad
miner jumped easily two feet from the ground
he uttered something that sounded like the snarl
of a wild beast and then he leaped forward like
a shot and ran into one of the many passages
that were close at hand

  hip hi exclaimed hop aloud and then he
broke into a laugh me allee samee makee um
mystelious man lun likee um deer so be me
velly smartee chinee

  hop did not know the outlaws were there or he
would never have spoken out loud the result was
that before the smoke from the cracker had
cleared away three or four of them were there
when he found himself struggling in their grasp
hop did not feel like laughing so much

  whatee mattee he cried in a frightened

way hip hi misler wild comee-

  but his cry was cut short by a heavy hand be-
ing thrust over his mouth and then he was
dragged into the quarters of the outlaws but
the outaws evidently did not think it worth while
to tie him so he boldly took a seat upon the table
thus it was that young w ild west saw him a few
minutes later what happened then has already
been described when the clever chinaman et
off the second cracker he made up his mind to get
out of the place and this he did but he tumbed
in a heap over wild and his two partners and
then it was that ariettas scream and the cry of
the mad miner rang out wild quickly seized the
chinaman and lifted him to his feet

  come on he said in a low tone of voice we
have trot something to do now arietta has been
caught by a madman

  alee light misler wild me-

  but the boy did not wait to hear what reply he
would make he started on a run through the
passage after charlie and jim who had already
started something told our hero that the out-
laws would not come out just then nine they
feared the mad miner so that they would wait
until they were sure he was well away from the
place just then the voice of arietta was heard
again

  wild wild she screamed save me i am
in the power of a fiend

  the voie came from somewhere above them
and our w <: ' »*> ro  hi-h wnv to cot to
	young wild west

her but they knew it was not safe for them to
remain where they were so they went on out
through the dark passage it was there that the
girl must have been caught by the madman and
as he had not come that way they might find the
way he went nothing more was heard and when
they reached the mouth of the passage they ran
out and turned then- gaze upward then it was
that they noticed for the first time that there was
a way to clamber up the cliff

  come boys exclaimed the dashing young
deadshot who though his face was pale was as
cool as ever this is the way to get up there i
reckon we must find where the fiend went and
that verv soon poor arietta is worse off now
than shewould be if she was in the power of the
outlaws

  his partners nodded and up they went keeping
close behind him but hop did not go farvip the
rockv ascent he paused when he got to the first
ledge thinking that he might better take a dif-
ferent route meanwhile young wild west kept
straight on there was a ledge above them that
must nave been at least a hundred feet from the
bottom of the canyon and they headed for it wild
in the lead with the loosened stones and dirt
rattling down past them they hurried on in an-
other minute they were there then it was that a
simultaneous cry went up from their lips as
wild and his partners reached the ledge they be-
held a startling sight arietta had fainted and
was handing limp upon the arm of the mad miner
who was waving a flaming skull over his head

  back he cried the girl is mine mine for-
ever

  then as quick as a flash he stepped back from
their view swiftly receding footsteps told them
that he was getting away from them but wild
caught hold of a jagged piece of rock and drew
himself upward then he darted through a rift
in the face of the cliff charlie and jim were
right at his heels now and bent on catching the
madman and saving arietta they ran swiftly
along around a bend in the cleft they went and
then they were dismayed to find that there was
nothing but what appeared to be a solid wall of
rock ahead of them wild looked ahead and then
on either side bat there was no visible means of
going any further as far as he could see con-
sidering that the mad miner had only had a few
seconds the start of him this seemed puzzling
indeed but young wild west was not the one
to be baffled easily too many times had he been
brought fai-e to face with great difficulties

  boys said he coolly the crazy galoot has
tricked us if he went through here so can we
hurry up make an examination there must be
a secret opening that is covered we have got to
find it

  but charlie and jim were already at work mak-
ing a search they were tapping the rock with
the butts of their revolvers and listening for a
hollow sound that would tell them that there was
an opening of some sort beyond the wall wild
advanced as far as he could go and tried tapping
on the rock that barred further progress through
the passage in his judgment the rock was not
more than a few inches in thickness

  here we ave boys he said this piece of

in death canyon

lock must be dislodged we will have to get
something to do it with though there is no use
in trying to force our way through just by using
our hands and feet jim go and get a crowbar
all right wild answered dart who was
ready to do anything he was told

  he lost no time in descending to the level be-
low and then he hurried to join those they had
left- waiting in the canyon jim was not long in
reaching them it happened that they had been
unable to see the mad miner though they had
heard his cries and also ariettas screams while
he was gone wild and charlie used -all their
strength in trying to force aside the rock that
barred their way though it trembled slightly
from the pressure they brought to bear upon it
they could not dislodge it in a little while jim
came back with the crowbar

  where is hop our hero asked he thinking
that the celestial might be of some service to
them just then

  i saw nothing of him replied dart he did
not go back to the rest either he must be some-
where about though probably he is trying to
find arietta on his own hook

  maybe he is well never mind let me have
that crowbar

  the boy took it and the next minute he was
working away like a beaver in an effort to get the
bar under the rock so it might be pried aside
young wild west though a mere boy was well
experienced in such work he went at in the right
way and in less than five minutes he forced the
rock to yield to the pressure brought upon it
the scout lent his aid and then it swung over and
fell to the ground narrowly missing falling upon
the foot of the latter a continuation of the pas-
sage was at once disclosed

now then boys come on said wild i
reckon we will soon get the galoot now he is
mad beyond the shadow of a doubt but if he
harms a hair in ariettas head i will forget that
art of it if we find that she is all right leave
im to me i i-eckon i can handle aim

 along the passage they ran and the next min-
ute they found it led into the vast cavern part of
which was occupied by the outlaws but this
made no difference to them if the outlaws had
numbered a hundred and they knew they would
be surely killed if they met them they would not
have hesitated they had seen the plight of the
girl and that was enough they did not blame
her for fainting away which was something that
a  ietta was not in the habit of doing charlie
lighted a match when they had gone a short dis-
tance into the underground passage for it was as
dark as a pocket in there

  the whole place was a regular honeycomb as
has been stated and there was no telling what
minute they might step into some hole

  the lighted match lasted long enough for them
to get a hundred feet and when it burned out the
scout lighted another in thffc way they kept on
until they saw daylight ahead though rather
faintly it increased as they proceeded however
and two minutes later they came to the identical
where hop had dropped down the chute
thunder exclaimed the scout in a hoarse
whisper this aint making much headway not
young wild west

if i know it that galoot yer call ther mad
miner has give us ther slip wild

   dont say that charlie we have got to find
him thats all

   well yer kin bet your life that i wont never
give up till we do

   they moved away from the spot treading soft-
ly so they might not be heard by the outlaws
when they had gone a few feet along the wide
passage that seemed a sort of gallery they came
to a place where three passages branched from it
young wild west made up his mind what to do
right away there were three of them so each
could take a different direction and something
might result from it he quickly made known his
thoughts and charlie and jim promptly agreed
with him

   you take the one to the right jim the young
deadshot said i will take the center one and
charlie can go to the left be very careful both
of you and in case you get into trouble just fire
a shot

  they all understood what was to be done and
without anything further they set out

  chapter x-arietta and the mad miner

  as wild supposed arietta had been caught by
the mad miner as she was going through the dark
passage to join those waiting outside the girl
did not have the least chance for the crazed uian
must have heard her footsteps and was waiting
for her he picked her up as though she had been
nothing more than an infant and then he has-
tened outside with her letting out his awful
shriek as she called loudly for help but he
pressed his hand over her mouth then and not
until they got well toward the top of the cliff did
she get the chance to make another cry but he
coked at her with eyes that blazed with anger
hen and the girl was so terrified when she re-
alized that she was in the power of a madman
that she fainted away	

  it could not have been many minutes that the
girl remained in an unconscious state w hen she
did awaken to a realization of what had happened
she found herself lying on a rude couch lormed
of skins her hands tied and a bunch of rags
stuffed in her mouth so she could not cry out it
was a small cave that she was in and a light was
burning in one of the corners as the girl looked
at this she saw it was a human skull that was
probably filled with some kind of grease for there
was a wick sticking above it and u was this that
was burning with a fitful blaze there were cook-
ing utensils hanging to the wall near a fireplace
that had been built of flat pieces of stone and
there was a small table that was very rudely con-
structed near by with a solitary stool close to it

   across the furthest corner from the girl was a
curtain of blankets sewed together and as arietta
took in her surroundings and gradually regained
her faculties she saw the curtain move slightly
the next minute it was thrown aside and out
stepped her captor by a great effort she calmed
herself and began to think of a way to get the
best of the wild man as he approached her a
kindly expression shone from his eyes

in death canyon	

  it is too bad young lady he said in a voice
that was almost as gentle as that of a mother
talking to her babe i saw you as you c me
through the dark down there and i had to take
you for my own  once had a littgirl with hair
just like yours and eyes the same she died and
so did her mother and since that time  know not
what has happened but when i saw you i made
up my mind that my little one had come back
larger grown but my daughter speak is it
so are you my little jane

  arietta shook her head and managed to give a
stifled gasp

  instantly the madman dropped upon his knees
and placed his hands upon the gag that was in her
mouth listen he said with dramatic force
they would come to take you from me but you
must not go if you speak above a whisper  will
forget that you look like my dead child and i
will kill you

  the last came from his lips more like a hiss
than words and the savage unnatural light again
shone in his eyes the next minute he had re-
moved the gag he drew a gleaming knife from
his belt and shook it before her eyes at the same
time

   will do just as you bay she faltered in a
trembling voice i am glad i look like your
dead daughter though i am not her the dead
cannot come back to life

  how do you know that asked the man eager-
ly

  i-i have always been taught that way and i
have never known it to happen

  well girl when you have lived as long as i
have and thought as much as  have you will
change your mind they call me the mad miner
and  like it i may be crazed but  have not lost
my memory altogether  have gained in skill and
cunning though at times there is a cloud that
comes over my brain and i know not what i do

i am very rich for i have gold back there point-
ing to the curtain that is enough for one to live
in luxury for a lifetime

  he paused and sat down before the girl who
had now risen to a sitting posture

  you should not worry over those who have jft
you forever said arietta there is a long life
ahead of you and you should give up this wild
way of living why they say you are a fiend-
that you catch your victims and kill them and
then go about with their hideou- skulls
you-

   stop cried the mad miner raising his finger

i do not kill those who do not try to kill me
the skulls  use are those i pick up on the desert 
there are many to be found there for men starve
and die in the search for gold this is a bad
country but i know where to get the things i
need and sometimes i am gone from death can-
yon a week at a time but i always come back
for here is my home and here it always will be

  i know you are a good man at heart ven-
tured the helpless girl

  yes that is right i am a good man at heart
sometimes i think i am making a mistake and
then my mind goes blank again i might be cured
of my madness if i were placed in some institu-
tion where good treatment could be given me


young wild west in death canyon

  wont you untie my hands asked arietta
hoping- that he might give way to the request

  vcs was the reply but dont think that
you can get away from me there is no way of
doing it that you know of dont try it if you
do i may-

  he stopped abruptly ami then he quickly untied
the rope that held her hands together

  dont try to get away he said in a low tone
of voice you can never do it you are mine
forever you are my daughter jane who has
come back to life and who will live with me to
give me comfort even though her mother is not
here

  arietta said no more on that point rising to
her feet she took the stool and sat down how
long have you lived in this cave she asked after
a rather lengthy pause

  the mad miner shook his head

   dont know lie retorted wearily but come
jae i will show you my gold it will be yours
when  am dead ami gone think of that jane

   tlank you very much for saying that ari-
etta replied as she arose from the stool

  he took her gently by the arm and conducted
her to the blanket curtain hushing it aside he
forced her to go through and then taking the
flaming skull he followed her at first arietta
tlought she was in a smaller apartment which
was really where the mad m m slept but as the
ight filled the place she quickly saw an opening
that led into another part of the cavern the
daylight came in from some place too anil this
was enough to make the girl keep up her courage
into a wide cave they went and then still keep-
ing hod of in arm the mad miner turned and
went toward the part where the light came
through  was probably a hundred feet from the
rocky apartment occupied as a dwelling by the
madman that they came to a halt on the verge of
a precipice outside but it was not the side that
overlooked the canyon arietta could tell that
right away she was now looking over a vast
tract of broken desert

  see down there said her captor pointing to
a ledge that was but a few feet below theie is
niv gold mine

  the girl looked over ami saw a hole in the
ground and right at the mouth of it was a pile
of glittering nuggets

  there is a fortune there she gasped you
are indeed rich my father

  as she said this a happy light shone in the eyes
of the man

  i am rich anil you will be rich when  am
gone but you must never leave me child as
long as i am alive i will live long for i am
strong and hardy and the bullets of those who
fear and hate me will never harm me unless they
reach my head i wear something that is bullet
proof child i am invincible to my foes there
are bad men near us but they fear me and they
dare not come to harm you your friends will
search for you until they find they can never find
you and then they will give you up as lost and go
on their way hut come we will go back

  there was mo use in raising any objections but
since she h i non where tl-e mailmans gold was
arietta wa more than satisfied t  lvielc with

him it might be that wild or some of the rest
had found the way there and were waiting to
take her from the crazed man back they made
their way and as the man had now released her
from hi- grasp upon her arm arietta walked
along lree she had a small revolver under her
bodice and she could easily have drawn it and
shot him but she would not do this for he had
not harmed a hair of her head and she could not
bring herself to do a thing like that it would be
arrant treachery that was sure relying on her
friends to save her the girl followed him back
to the little cave the inner part was passed
through and when the curtain dropped behind her
arietta took her place upon the stool again she
looked around but could see nothing that would
indicate that anybody had been there during their
absence the mad miner went to the mouth of
the cave and looked out at the sun it was now
nearly directly over his head and with a nod he
came back

  you must be hungry he said you will eat
of the best i have

  thank you replied the girl i am getting
hungry

  well and a crafty look suddenly came in his
eyes i will sit here and you can get the meal
ready you will find provisions behind that board
over there that is my closet the board- is the
door to it though there are no hinges  must get
hinges for it and then it will be all right

  he took his station where it was impossible for
her to get out of the cave without being seized by
him so she vent to the dose as he called it and
found meat and other eatables there she decid-
ed to go about it just as though she were in camp
with her companions ami she worked awaj brisk-
ly noticing this the mad miner went to the fire-
place and started a fire

  we will have some coffee with the broiled
meat he said

  arietta nodded and then he turned to the
mouth of the cave and took his station there as
though lie was doing guard duty it took some
little time to prepare the meal and though she did
not hurry much the girl went on steadily all the
while hoping that her dashing young lover might
come ii she had only known that he was very
close at hand at that very moment probably she
would have stopped in her work youngwild
west was coming all right

chapter xi-what hop did

  it will now be in order to turn our attention to
hop  ah who decided to strike out for himself
and make a search for arietta hop only climbed
as far a- the first ledge and when he saw wild
and his partners going on up he turned to the left
and made his way along the ledge keeping his
eyes open for anything in the line of an opening
large enough to admit a person as luck would
have it he quickly found one and just as he en-
tered it he heard the mad miner shout out the
words to the effect that arietta was his forever

  he decided to push through the aperture ami try
and find the man who had uttered them he had
not gone many feet before the aperture widened
eonsicblv and then he nuhed on swiftly he
young wild west

vent up a short ascent and then down again un-
til he found himself in a large roekv chamber
the indistinct sound of voices now came to his
ears but hop was now pretty certain that he had
struck the right spot so he listened it was a
mans voice and the words were mere mutter-
ings

  lat um clazy man so be the chinaman
thought

  after listening for a minute br two longer he
pushed his way along the side of the oave and
then came to an opening through which he could
see the blue sky and rocky formations on a vast
desert it occurred to him that he must have
come through the cliff and was now looking out
from the other side suddenly his eyes turned
downward and then it was he gave a violent
start lying before an opening in the ground
upon a ledge but a few feet below was a heap of
golden nuggets he quickly found a way to get
down to the glittering pile and the next minute
he was weighing some of the nuggets in his hand
tiring of this he turned his attention to the
opening in the ground inside the hole he saw a
pocket with gold on all sides

  a pick shovel and pan such as miners use lay
there which showed that the place had been
worked putting a few nuggets in his pocket he
clambered bak upon the upper ledge stepping
back into the cave he went on around looking
for some other outlet in a very few seconds he
came to the passage that led into that portion of
the cavern that was occupied as a sleeping quar-
ters by the mad miner then it was that he sud-
denly heard a man talking within a few feet of
him he listened and when he heard what he
said he instantly became convinced that it was
arietta who wasbeing addressed

  the longer he listened the more he became con-
vinced that the clazy man as he called him did
not mean to harm a hair in the girls head when
the mad miner invited arietta to go with him and
ock at his gold mine hop crouched closer into
the niche as the curtain was lifted and the
light filled the place he could see both the girl
and her captor plainly waiting until they had
passed into the back chamber beyond the clever
chinaman arose and followed them softly he
saw the madman take the girl to the very ledge
upon which he had been standing when he got
sight of the glittering nuggets below and then he
crept up close enough to listen and hear what was
said then he made up his mind to iret back to
the ledge with a great deal of difficulty he man-
aged to find his way back to the ledge from which
he started

  maybe me better go findce misler wild and
him partners len ley comee velly mucliee quickee
and takee missee alietta away flom um mad
miner

  without going down to those who were wait
ing he followed in the direction wild and his

fmrtners had taken and was soon upon the upper
edge then he followed the same route our hero
had taken with charlie and jim and passing
through the place that had been opened by means
of the crowbar and finding the crowbar still
there the chinaman gave a nod and continued his
way hut there were so many passages this way
and that that it was not long before he found that

tn death canyon	

he was lost however he retraced his steps and
tried another route this too failed for he came
to a spot where he could go no farther but
nothing daunted he tried again and at the ex-
piration of perhaps fiftr-en minutes he suddenly
rtime face to face with cheyenne charlie

  me velly gladee misler charlie declared hop
me findee missed alietta and me comee to findee
you and misler wild and misler jim

  what cried the scout in amazement you
found arietta you say

  yes me findee um mad miner no hurtee her
she allee light he say she um lillee girl lat he
had and he give her velly muchee gold so be
great gimlets exclaimed the scout cone
on you heathen galoot well find wild and jiin
as quick as we kin an then well go an git ari-
etta

  in less than five minutes the two had reached
the spot where wild and his partners had start-i
to go in different directions as luck would have
it jim dart appeared just then and almost be-
fore he became acquainted with what hop had di s-
covered wild appeared from another passage
the three had been searching long and they all
had been discouraged

  hop found where arietta is and he says shes
all right the scout said come on hes goin
ter lead us to ther spot

  stopping long enough to question him thor-
oughly wild gave an exclamation of delight and
then all four started back for the ledge that over-
looked the canyon it was easy for them to re-
trace their steps to that point and when they
came to the crowbar jim picked it up and car-
ried it with him once out upon the ledge the-
quickly descended to the lower one and then hop
conducted them to the narrow fissure in the rock
as he had passed that way twice the chinaman
had no difficulty in leading them through the
passage it was not long before they came to lh
cave and then wishing to prove that there was a
pile of gold there hop led them out through the
opening and pointed to it the sight of the glit-
tering nuggets fairly dazzled the eyes of our
friends hop cautioned them not to make any
noise so they only spoke in whispers

  how far is the cave from here wild asked
him

  velly lillee way so be was the reply me
showee you

  with wild at his side he went on stepping
carefully and they reached the inner apartment
that was occupied as a sleeping quarters by the
madman as our friends paused there they could
hear the clinking of tin plates or something of
the kind wild now pushed his way past the
chinaman ami stepping to the curtain pushed it
aside a few inches and peered out into the other
cave there was his sweetheart busy preparing a
meal while standing at the mouth of the cave was
the mad miner apparently in a very pleasant
mood he could see by the expression of ariet-
tas face that she was not very much frightened
and then it dawned upon him that the girl had
shown sufficient cleverness to humor the man and
thus save herself from being harmed he turned
and beckoned to charlie and jim to come and have
a look the two did so and when they saw how
things were they were amazed


young wild west in death canyon

  we must not hurt the man paid our hero
in a low whisper you can readily see that he has
not harmed arett  so we must not h rn him
well spring upon him and make him a prsoner
charlie and jim nodded to this and then they
prepared to throw aside the curtain and rush into
the cave

chapter xii-conclusion

   arietta soon had the meal ready

   come she said calling the man who had de-
clared that she was never to leave him again

   no was the reply you sit down and eat
i will wait

   it was just then that the curtain moved slight-
ly and instinctively the girl turned her gaze in
that direction then to her great joy it was
pushed back and the face of her daring young
lover was disclosed the girl could not help it
and with a cry of joy she sprang toward wild

  the mad miner turned like a hash what is
it jane he demanded

  then cheyenne charlie and jim dart threw
aside the curtain and sprang out the mad
miner uttered a snarl like that of an enraged
beast his mild manner was gone springing
toward the girl he cried out

   my child shall not be taken from me i will
kill her first

   charlie shot out his right fist and knocked him
down	

   the mad miner got upon his feet with remark-
able quickness then he uttered that awful cry
df his and darted out of the cave it all hap-
pened so quickly that neither charlie nor jim
could catch him

   after him boys said wild i will take care
of arietta

   the scout was olt like a shot and after him
went jim dart the madman did not get so far
ahead of them that they could not keep within
hearing of his footsteps so they kept right on
into a passage he turned anil they followed
after turning this way and that and following
rises and descents they soon found that they were
getting dangerously close to the quarters of the
outlaw band a minute later they saw that he
was running straight for it as he reached the
entrance he let out one of his screeching wails
and then he bounded right into the cave crack
crack-crack-crac-ck a volley of revolver
shots sounded and there was the sounds of a great
scuffle going on creeping up stealthily charlie
and jim came upon an exciting scene the mad
miner was rushing about the cave stabbing right
and left the outlaws were firing at him but
without effect in less time than it take to record
it three men were on the ground mortally wound-
ed from the quick knife-thrusts

  the madman let out another yell and then
captain harvey fell before a blow from the knife
another and another went for it seemed that
they could not get out of his way suddenly one
of the villains knocked the knife from his hand
but it was only a momentary triumph however
the mad miner grabbed a revolver from the hand
of another and then emptied its chambers as he
fired the hot he staejrered and fpll tn the

riou-id charlie anti dart looked over the scene
therr is not fin outlaw to be seen who was not
either dead or dy ng

  waiting a minute or two they stepped into the
rendezvous and approached the mad miner he
was lying still as he had dropped and a quick
examination told them that he was dead our
two friends made an examination of the body and
found it was encased in a coat of mail under the
shh-t they were satisfied the way things had
turned out so they soon left the cave and made
their way outside when they got there they
found wild arietta and hop just coming down
from the ledge which was but a short distance
away

  jhoopee shouted the scout waving his hat

  everything is all over with wild ther mad
miner has passed in his chips an so has ther
whole blamed lot of ther outlaws

  jim dart joined in giving a genuine cowboy
yell and then hop let out one of his peculiar
whoops they had not long in joining the rest of
the party it had been a long wait but anna and
eloise appreciated the safe return of arietta all
the more for it harry muller was very pale but
when he saw them all coming back safe and
sound his face lighted up

  the story was soon told and then they went
a - antp ant dinner as might be supposed
arietta quickly recovered from the ordealshe had
passed through when in the power of the mad
miner as soon as they had eaten dinner wild
suggested that they go and get the gold that had
ben given to arietta

  if we can find that he has any relatives liv-
ing they shall have the mine said wild but
in the meantime you can let harry muller work it
on shares for you et

   all right replied the girl

  do you mean that the prospector asked

  i hey both assured him that thev did and then
ail hands repaired to the spot it was not difficult
to reach it after they once knew the way the
pile of nuggets was divided into bags and then
they left and went bark into the canyon it was
just then that the three men thev had met that
morning appeared one of them fired a shot
and then there was a lively time for a few min-
utes the result was that the three who cer-
tainly must have belonged to the outlaw band
were shot down it was near sunset when they
rode into the mining camp which was not so very
far away

  it had taken the greater part of the afternoon
to lix up matters and when thev got there every-
thing was just to their satisfaction wild decided
to remain there for a couple of days and then
strike ut again for further adventures those
uiey had met with since entering death canyon
had surely been all our friends could wish for
but arietta s experience with the mad miner was
certamiy far more thrilling than anything else
that had happened however the clever chinee
had been smart enough to find her and thus
everything turned out all right

-or-

the boy treasure hunters of
yucatan

by dick ellison

a serial story

chapter xxiv-continued

thats it echoed horry see them go

  they fled like flies before a fly flapper and
 anished within the building while sam came
coolly down the steps

  what about that he demanded triumphant-
ly-

  you killed or wounded several i saw them
fall cried al

  yes and let them lie where they fell be they
lead or wounded no one must go near them re-
plied sam that settles it they will not re-
turn

  nor did they but just the same al never
looked out of his hammock that night that he did
not see sam standing guard

  as soon as breakfast was over the march was
resumed

  sam scarcely spoke all day

at night they camped on the bank of a stream

  sams indians did the cooking and that night a
peculiar dish of some sort of boiled greens was
served to col heud mona and the boys of
which as it tasted good al ate freely

  they found themselves unusually tired and
-sleepy as soon as supper was over and as sam
assured them that all danger was over now they
at once sought their hammocks

  ai was asleep in an instant and it was so with
the others when they awoke the sun was high
and the camp unusually still

  al sprang up and dropping out of his ham-
mock saw col ileffud coming toward him

  well this is a pretty piece of business the
latter exclaimed

  whats the matter where is everybody
cried al

  the matter is replied the colonel that sam
and his followers have decamped in the night
those greens we ate were uudoubtcdly drugged
or are themselves of a nature to make one sleep
i know i slept like a log so did mona oliver
isnt awake yet how about you

  same with me cried al but how about our
mules and our share of the treasure

  all right the mules are further down
stream where there is a ford and so are my men
and just as much of the gold as he agreed to give
us but the rascal has made otf with the rest and
takes his bunch with him as for my indians i
cant get a word out of them they claimed to
nave slept through it all too but i dont believe
a word of it

well said al he seems to have playedi

square at all events and if he chooses to go his
way and leaves us to go ours i dont see that we
have any kick coming

oh i dont know growled the colonel if

i	could once have got the fellow in belize per-
haps there would have been another division of
those selfsame jars of gold

perhaps sam thought so too and that is why
he deserted as he did

at all events they saw no more of him and in
due time the whole party landed safely at belize
where al and oliver took passage for new or-
leans with their treasure going on to new york
by rail

both were ready to admit that it wasnt such
a bad wind-up of their adventure after all

they had been in a land where no white man
had ever been they had been in all kinds of stir-
ring adventures coming through without a days
illness or a scratch and with enough money to
give them a good start in life

oliver banked his and went to sea again

to-day he is the captain of a coasting steamer
married and very well-to-do

al carried out his plan and is now one of the
most noted chemists in america he has not yet
married but there are rumors that he soon in-
tends to be and that a pretty english woman
now a widow but who was once known as miss
mona heatheringford will be his wife the col-
onel is long since dead

al went to paris to study as proposed

one day while walking on the boulevard ilaus-
mann he saw a dark stylish man pass in an au-
tomobile with him was a white woman evidently
his wife and two handsome dark-skinned boys

it was surely sam but he never looked at al
who learned that he was known in paris as
senor prado a mexican and was reputed very
rich

al had some thought of calling on him in-

how stags antlers grow and decay

  tho annual growth and decay of a stags an-
tlers is one of the most marvellous happenings in
nature

  in the late summer the growth is complete and
the stags spend their time rubbing off the vel-
vet against the tree trunks then at the end of
september the fighting season begins and fierce
battles are fought for the possession of a mate
during the winter everything becomes quiet
again and in the early spring the antlers grad-
ually become dead and drop off leaving the ani-
mal miriclc to begin again

          gem in garage
a diamond stud worth about  lay for two
days on the floor of a local garage in albany
ore about two weeks ago

  after the owner had been found and the stud
forwarded to him the circumstances of its loss
and recovery became known

  the stud was owned by dr ii d coventry of
culver city cal and was forwarded io him by
a f holyn manager of the garage in which it
was lost and found dr coventry passed through
albany by auto the day before christmas after
he had made a purchase in this garage he dis-
covered the loss of the stud two days later the
stud was found

     find acids in corn cobs
the common corn cob which heretofore has
been a waste product on the farm may come to
bo considered a valuable article of commerce as
a result of experiments conducted by professors
e b fred and w ii peterson of th university
of wisconsin and reported to the wisconsin ag-
riculturist com cobs it was discovered are rich
in acetic and lactic acids both of which are used
extensively in the industries

  when the corn cobs are partially water soaked
and inoculated with the bacteria lactobacillus
pentoaceticus equal quantities of acetic and lactic
acid are produced if the yields on n commercial
scale are equal to the laboratory results every
ton of corn cobs will yield more than  pounds
of acetic and  pounds of lactic arid

  there are produced in the united states nlone
ore than  tons of corn cobs yearly a
small amount of these is used for pipes or in feed
but the great bulk usualy is discarded

  acetic acid is used largely in the dye inntry
and lactic acid is extensively used in the eather
industry both also are used in many technical
operations in various other industries

electric shower thrills alaska
advices received at seattle wash fr m tan-
ana alaska record some interesting dr tails re-
karding an atmospheric phenomenon following
a period of extreme cold weather

  the air was very still and dry and heavily
charged with electricity two persons shaking
hands received a severe shock and a burning sen-
sation through the whole body telegraph and
telephone wires sang and purred so loudly they
were audible for several miles husbands kissing
their wives were treated to the identical shock ex-
perienced in shaking hands two dogs were ob-
served to anger and fly at each other but when
the jaws of each struck the others body both
went howling in opposite direotions some rav-
ens flying through the rarified air passed suffi-
ciently close to each other to cause crackling
noises similar to the spluttering of a wireless re-
ceiving set

  the charged condition continued for several
hours and was followed the same evening by a
remarkable display of the aurora borealis ac-
companying its brilliancy were flashes of red and
green in riotous irregularity

my adventure

by john siierman

  i had been settled more than a year upon my
coffee estpte in the wild jungles of ceylon when
one morning during the idle season as i stood
before my bungalow gaping stretching and won-
dering how i might best amuse myself for the
day a coolie servant came up to me heated and
panting and placed in my hands the following
note

  dfar sir-will you come over at once to my
plantation and join in the chase or hunt of a
rogue elephant which is abroad somewhere in
the  vicinity and committing sad depredations
to the great terror of the natives who fear him
more than they do the evi one it is the duty
of every man who can bring a good nerve and a
rifle to turn out in defense of his surroundings to
say nothing of the sport hoping to receive a
favorable answer through the bearer monshee
in case you do not bring it yourself i am dear
sir	yours most truly

charles hoilingsworth

  mango hill retreat

  nothing nt the moment could have given me
more pleasure than this invitation to set off in
quest of a rogue elephant-for the sport would
certainly have that spice rf danger so necessary
to quicken blood that had become too sluggish
undr the enervating influence of the sweltering
tropics

  tell your master i am coming monshee said

i	as i turned away to get my rifle and ammu-
nition including zinc balls-for lead is too soft
for n elephants head-and order my horse un-
der saddle in the quickest possible time

  half an hour saw me on my way to mango
hill retreat distant ten miles with throe coolies
running alongside and keeping pace with my
impatient gallop and as i dash along lot me
tell you what the term rogue eleohant means
in case you never heard it before

  in the forests and jungles of ceylon at the
time i lived there there were hundreds of wild
elephants which generally moved about in small
herds and were not usually dangerous to man
though quite destructive to property--so much so
that the government had set a price upon the
head of each

  in herds as i have said there huge animals
were but little feared even by the natives but
it occasionally so happened from what cause i
have never been able to learn that an old tusker
would become detached from his companions and
like a maddened human malay seem to devote
the remainder of his life to attacking and killing
every living thing he could roach whether man
or beast and all from pure malice-from an in-
fernal fury that nothing but his own death could
appease

  with one of these furious monsters abroad no
one was safe

  fences were no barrier to his progress a coolie
hut might be crushed like the shell of an egg a
bungalow be brought crashing down about the
ears of the masters and even a whole village has
been half desti-oyed and the inhabitants put to
flight by a single beast

  in the language of the country this danger-
ous animal was termed a rogue elephant-though
mad elephant would have been by far a more
appropriate appellation

  when one of these was abroad it was the duty
of evei-y man as the note to me expressed to
turn out and hunt him to the death and i was
now hastening forward to perform the part of a
good citizen

  when about half-way between my house and
hollingsworths in a wild romantic part of the
country just where the road or path i was pur-
suing led down into a dark valley across a bright
stream into a strip of level jungle the coolies
running by my side suddenly stopped and yelped
out in terror pointing to some huge fresh foot-
prints that the rogue elephant hadjust passed

  how do you know these impressions were not
made yesterday i inquired stopping to ex-
amine them

  sec master returned a bright-eyed fellow
called lunekee pointing to the bushes against
which the huge body of the animal had pressed-
him brush off dew

  ah very true-you are right well then
he may be near and perhaps we may meet and
conquer him alone which would be a triumph
indeed

  him plenty much savage-fight like mischief
rejoined lunekee looking timorously around at
his timid companions and evidently willing to
forego all glory which could only be gained at so
much persona risk

  but i have my rifle said i two barrels--
zinc balls - and am a pretty sure shotand if i
can find him i am determined to try my hand

  just at this moment as if in answer to my
challenge there came a loud bellowing trumpet-
ing roar from the deep jungle before me followed
by the rustling snapping and crashing sounds
of some tremendous body making a quick way
through a dense thicket

  him a-coming-him a-coming cried the
frightened coolies and they suddenly vanished
like the witches of macbeth but rather into a
thick forest than thin air leaving me to run
or stay as inclination might prompt

  i must confess that inclination pleaded earn- 
estly for an inglorious retreat and mv gallant
steed was evidently of the same mind for he
wheeled reared plunged and would have gone off
like a shot if i had not sawed him down to a fine
dance how could i shoot from the back of such
a beast

  whiz flash rush what is that a spotted
deer passed me like a bolt of lightning scared by
that terrific trumpeting and crashing which
makes even the boldest beast of the jungle trem-
ble shall i stand and await his onset for he
is evidently coming this way and will soon be
here no my horse is too restive-the ground
tflb uncertain better get my first view of the
monster from the top of yonder hill
wild west

  away i go horse and rider of one mind this
time and in a minute have wheeled upon an ele-
vation that overlooks the spot where i first heard
the answering challenge of everybodys foe

  there he comes-tusks first and huge ones too
showing he is an old bull - trunk up trumpeting
out defiance-eyes fiery red and awfully wicked
and tail lashing his sides in fury

  thank heaven there is some distance between
us and i yet have the chance of fight or light

  better run much else climb tree a good deal
master says a voice over my head and looking
up in surprise i see lunekee snugly posted in
the upper branches of a tall ti-ee and another
glance shows his companions similarly situated
to the right and left of him

  if i fight the elephant i must depend on my-
self and horse and count nothing on my timid
servants or any human aid am i prepared for
the risk

  i look down at the man beast and he looks up
at me and then without half the consideration
that i have taken in the matter forward he
comes crushing the bushes snapping the smaller
trees like pipe-stems bent on my destruction

  it is a little to much of the dare-of the brav-
ado-to spit my easily excited and not ovei-
amiable temperament and so slipping down from
my snorting horse and passing the bridle over
my left arm i call out in defiance

  come on you savage monster anti get what
you dont seek be it life or death i will have
one shot at you now then see who i lord of the
forest-man with his puny strength and giant
intellect or brute with his tremendous physical
power and blind instinct

  i aim at his forehead but wait for him to come
near with my frightened horse pulling at the
bridle and making my sight unsteady on he
comos with his mad rush and thundering crash-
a sight to make any nervous mans heart flutter
like a caged bird and when within twenty paces
of me bang go both barrels

  ho is hit in the head but not killed and mad-
der than ever with the sting of pain he flourishes
his trunk trumpets forth his wild fury and in-
creases his speed to reach and crush me like a
troublesome moth there is nothing for it now
but flight-swift flight a few seconds more and
he will be upon me and i shall be among the
things that were

  fairly swinging myself upon my horse with
an agility worthy of a comanche indian i give
my noble beast the spur and the rein and away
we go over the hill at breakneck speed-rocks
bushes and trees not once considered in our race
for life

  seeing my danger the coolies posted beyond
the reach of the elephant now shout and scream
to attract his attention and draw him from the
pursuit he hears the noise glances upward with
his fiery eyes and turns to seek the nearest foe

  ihe tree of lunekee receives his mad favor
wishing at that he butts it an awful blow
ith his huge tusks-a blow that jars and shakes
 kc a small earthquake makes every limb and
eat quiver and almost unseats the poor follow
of i f s to  wth	strength and hopes

weekly	

  then he seizes it with his trunk bellows forth
his rage exerts all his mighty force and bends
and shakes it as i might bend and shake a birch
and then retreating to gather headway he butts
it again ripping off the bark and goring it with
his tusks but failing to bring down his human
prey

  but this time he seems to have forgotten me
altogether but i have not forgotten him

  checking my horse at a safe distance  pro-
ceed to reload my two barrels with inc ball-
in the greatest possible haste and before he is
satisfied to turn and seek another victim i spur
my horse up to a dangerous vicinity get him
quiet for a moment just in the nick of time ami
blaze away again directly at the monsters head

  this time-thank heaven-my aim ha been
true and both balls go through his thick kull
and sink into his brain he stops staggers reeis
-gets a dim view of me-tries to make another
charge-steps out feebly-totters and falls with
a loud crash sending forth the wildest bellows
of rage and pain and then lies so helplessly on
his huge side that even a child need no longer
fear him

  a few half-smothered groans some convlusivc
jerks a quivering throughout the great mass and
all is over the body and limbs grow still and the
furious formidable dreadful rogue elephant is
dead

  no general after his victory ever felt his tri-
umph more triumphantly than i did as i walked
up seated myself on the dead monster of the
wilderness and received like a king upon his
throne the congratulations and praises of my
loyal servants who now gathered around me
shouting and dancing

  leaving the beast in their charge i remounted
my horse and finished my ride to mango hill re-
treat where i found hollingworth and some half
a dozen others only waiting for my arrival to
begin the perilous hunt to which i had been in-
vited

  when i told them of my adventure they could
hardly credit my story and rode with me to be
confirmed of its truth the result made a great
man of me in all my region and probably no one
act of my life ever afforded me so much satis-
faction taken in all its bearings as my en-
counter with and destruction of that savage
rogue elephant

economical

  jacob bowder of mason city la practicing
what he oiills a careful system of buying ami
cooking has made public an inventory of his
household expenses for five and a half months for
himself and wife which he challenges any one to
beat

  the total amount spent was  excluding
rent everything bought was of good quality he
says and they had three square meals a day with
meat and everything necessary for health and
happiness

  economy is merely a condition of mind says
bowder nowadays folks spend altogether to
much for things they would be better off without
high cost of living need have no worries for the
average man w-ho will plan rightly

knew where more could be found but would never
give out any information as to where he secured
them he finally had the nuggets manufactured
into stick pins and other ornaments he inti-

        a modern crusoe
when the pacific steam navigation companys
steamship ebro arrived recently with passengers
and mail from valparaiso and other ports on the
est coast of south america captain e e
duncan said that the vessel had paid a visit to
the island of juan fernandez  miles off the
coast of chile and known generally as robinson
crusoes island

the captain said that the trip from valparaiso
took five days and was arranged by the agent of

the company in valparaiso at the request of ahout
 american touri-ts who had come over the
transandean railroad from buenos aires purser

ii	t browne got up a fancy dress ball and din-

lobsters weighing twelve pounds and measuring
two feet over -ill the purser added are caught
off the island and sent alive in fast sailing school-

having an unusually delicate flavor

  the island is about thirty miles in circum-
ference and has a chain of ancient volcanic peaks
tropical vegetation is kept alive by heavy dews
which fall like rain every night the passengers
visited the cave where alexander selkirk lived

the airplane in peace

  now that the great war is over the airplane
which played so large a part in it is being used
for the purpose of peace

  airplanes help the fishermen they fly over the
sea and spot the shoals of herrings of pilchard or
mackerel and send the news to the fishing boats
they talk of using airplanes to round up the vast
herds of caribou or wild reindeer which roam
over the wastes of northern canada

  planes are being used for exploring central
africa anti even for flying over the unknown ice
fields of the far arctic in australia the air-
plane is found to be immensely useful on the huge
sheep ranches some of them as large as an eng-
lish county a man in a plane can cover as much
ground in a day as he could in a month on horse-
back he can find where the sheep are grazing
whether dingoes are attacking them and the con-
dition of the water supply

  the latest use for the airplane is for catching
water fowl alive in the sacramento valley of
california are great flats haunted by vast flocks
of wild ducks geese and swans

  a plane was fitted with two funnel-shaped nets
and flown across these flats the rush of the
plane through the air kept the nets out stiff and
straight and the pilots say that it was most ex-
citing business swooping after the whirling flocks
of flowl they found that the plane was faster
than any of the birds but could not dodge or
maneuver so quickly as they

  however in three days flying they caught 
birds keeping fifty of the younger ones they
liberated the rest these young ones are foi
stocking private ponds and lakes

 saw hundreds of dead whales
that the monsters of the deep fight in groups
as well as engage in personal encounters is tes-
tified to by captain g evererl toole a commis-
sioner in the gold coast colony who writes the
following to his brother concerning an experi-
ence during his voyage from england

  between sierra leone and sekondi we steamed
through for over a hour a blood-red sea and
saw some hundreds of whales dead or dying on
the surface of the water some were just able
to move slowly along few if any could move
quickly there must have been a sanguinary
battle supposed to have been put up by sword-
fish

  it was a most appalling sight and the extent
of the bloody expanse must have represented the
death of many more whales than were visible
no one on our ship had ever seen or even heard
of anything approaching such a spectacle be-

rats menace budapest

  rats and mice are migrating in swarms from
the russian famine area and budapest is now
overrun with them all efforts to rid the city of
this scourge have failed and the devastation
caused by them goes on apace

  the market halls food stores and warehouses
are swarming with the rodents which run about
even in the daytime so dangerous have they be-
come that when disturbed they will turn and show
fight

  the situation is aggravated by the dearth of
cats during the war when food was scarce
thousands of families ate their cats since then
the increasing demand for cat fur has taken a
further toll ae a consequence the comparatively
exorbitant price of  to  kronen is being
offered for a kitten by shopkeepers

  in some villages peasants have turned to the
now lucrative business of cat breeding

gold that disappears

  do you know how gold shows its dislike for sea-
water especially that of the atlantic ocean

  many shipments of gold have been sent to
america recently in discharge of our debts and
every time a curious thing always happens
when the gold reached its destination and the
american officials weighed it carefully it was
found to have lost weight during the voyage

  at first everyone imagined the cause to he that
the scales in america and other countries differed
but a test of the various scales showed that they
were exactly the same

  then it was that expert investigated the mys-
tery after many tests it has been discovered
that during its journey across the atlantic the
action of the sea-water caused the gold to
sweat

  it is usual to pack the metal in stout kegs
squeezing it as tight as possible but any way
in which the cold is packed it always loses weight

  now the coins are allowed to grind against
each other thus wearing them down a little and
a regular allowance is made for the loss

forest rangers rescue elk

  after an arduous trip of fifty miles into the
mountainous region at the headwaters of dunga-
ness river two forest rangers succeeded in re-
leasing a herd of eighty or ninety wild elk snow-
bound in a draw or hole and which were on the
verge of death by starvation

  by a queer coincidence eddie hubbard carry-
ing mail by airplane between seattle and victoria
canada routed his homeward trip inland over the
foothills of the olympic mountain to avoid a
strong gale on puget sound skirting close to
the tops of the forest trees he observed the wild
elk snowbound in a natural inclosure of drifted
snow when he reached home he notified the
state game commissioners office of his belief
who at once ordered an investigation

  alex mcpherson and george gates of quilcene
wash started at once over a well known trail
carrying provisions on pack horses the fifty
miles into the wilderness was made in two days
and the elk located the animals were belly deep
in snow floundering about subsisting on fir
boughs and moss breaking through a snow-
drift barrier the elk gamely followed the men
and their horses down into the valley where graz-
ing materia flourished in abundance of the ex-
hausted animals but two fell dead after release

  the brave act is being heralded throughout
elkton fraternity and the two rangers will be
presented with a suitable reward

  the olympic elk usually foretell big snow-
storms and hurry into the valleys but this bunch
herded up together in a sheltered hole and were
cut off from food

 few people
realize that there
are such things
as vegetable
pearls yet how
and again in cer-
t a i n tropical
plants curious
hard substances
are found which
one may properly
call pearls see-
ing that their
composition is al-
most identical
with the product
of the oyster for
instance occas-
ionally in java
these substances
are discovered in
the joints of bam-
boos on analy-
sis the bodies are
found to consist
of almost pure
carbonate of lime
-the same sub-
stance which goas
to the make-up of
the pearl of the
oyster now and
again similar
bodies are found
in the endosperm
of the coconut
while these plant
pearls are known
to occur in the
wood of the
pomegranate and
teak trees these
vegetable pearls
are sometimes as
large as a hazel
nut although as a
rule they are
a little smaller
they are general-
ly believed to be
due to an excess
of calcareous and
silicious matter-
in the plant the
plant pearls are
rarely seen apart
from the east
indian islands for
they are highly
vnlued as charm
the owrncr will
not part with one
for any figure
seeing that as
long as he holds
the pearl he con-
siders that he
will be immune
from all ills
which commonly
assail mankind

   during a jour-
 ney of explora-
 tion to dalmatia
 dr rudolf dit-
 mar of graz ob-
 served that the
 dalmatian fisher-
 men used nets
 dyed in wonder-
 ful shades of
 brown and bright
 green searching
 inquiries on his
 part brought out
 the fact that the
 green nets were
 dyed by means of
 an extract made
 from the pistacia
 butincvs while
 the brown nets
 were colored by a
 dye obtained from
 the bark of the
 pinus malepensis
 the fishermen dye
 their nets by
 no means for the
 sake of mere pic-
 t u rcsqu eness
 they have found
 b y experience
 that while the
 fish are canny
 enough  to fear
 the white nets
 and flee f rom
 them as from a
 danger signal
 they swim calm-
 ly into the meshes
 of the green and
 brown ones it
 seem probable
 that this is be-
 cause the green
 and brown
 strands of the i
 nets are not un- 
 like the floating 
 strands of sea-
 weed though an-
 other explanation
 which has been
 suggested is that
 the eye of the fish
 is unable to dis-
 tinguish these
 two colors from
 that of the sea i

 water

  the dyes in
 question are ex- i
 tracted by means j
 of fresh water
