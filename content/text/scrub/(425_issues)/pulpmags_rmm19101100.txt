tales of the tallow-pots

by tom jackson

if you think that a fireman cant spin a yarn that is full of real ginger with
tobasco trimmings just read this bunch by tom jackson which we have
selected to open the thanksgiving number of tjie railroad mans maga-
zine they contain just the sort of spice that one expects to find in all things
at this feasting time of the year

    it is a pretty ordinary railroad happening in which a diamond-pusher fails
to figure in some way or other when it comes to excitement he is generally
johnny-on-the-spot and he is the hero of as many hair-raising adventures as any
other member of the crew

    most of these tales were gathered at the recent brotherhood convention held
in st paul minnesota where the boys assembled in large numbers

in a dakota blizzard-the two johns-why a mail clerk became a sleuth
-the troubles of a smokeless hog-how kim

met the governor

re is a firemans story of a
dakota blizzard

  the beautiful snow was
swirling round our train in
chunks it was thirty-five de-
grees below zero and the wind
was blowing a hurricane

  the only air we could see from the cab
window was absolutely white air and we
couldnt see so awful much of that most of
the time we two in the cab couldnt see the
nose of the engine in a particularly clear
swirl of snow we sometimes were able to
make out a large-sized section-house as far
away as a hundred feet

    it was on the division out of fargo west-
      rr	

ward the great northern was spending
five hundred dollars a day just to keep the
track clear on that one division we crawled
along never faster than ten miles an hour
and we were all day getting over the division

    my engineer liked to keep his conversa-
 tion consistent with our surroundings-he
 would talk of nothing but polar expeditions

   well we slowed down to four miles an
hour and strained our eyes on the lookout
for an expected station and a water tank
the engineer was doping out the reason why
polar bears are white when suddenly i in-
terrupted him by shouting

      we just passed the station well have
 to back down and find it again 


the railroad mans magazine

  when we finally got next to that station
i went in and sat down by the stove the
station-agent said

     im going to sleep on the floor of this
office to-night

   but your rooming house is only a hun-
dred steps up the road i replied

     true he said  but look at the pre-
vailing atmosphere within that hundred steps
after dark you cant see even the headlight
of an engine is there any certainty then
that a lantern in front of my house would
guide me

    do you know what happened to a sec-
tion-hand out here last night its gospel
truth he was walking track and happened
to step out from between the rails he didnt
step moren two feet from the track of that
he is sure yet he walked round and round
in a circle all the rest of the night trying to
find the track again

  ui so im not taking any chances in find-
ing my room even if it is only a hundred
steps away ill sleep here

  we then crawled up to the water tank
i pulled the spout down and let in the water
as i shoved the spout up a voice in the bliz-
zard said

    do you know your wheels are frozen to
the rails  

  it was the voice of superintendent jim
davis-the same jim davis who is now gen-
eral superintendent of the oregon short line

   he was on the train during all our
trouble with the blizzard that day and a
better railroader never lived he even helped
us with the hand-picks in chopping the en-
gine free from the rails for sure as youre
born in those few minutes the drippings from
the spout had frozen and we were held so
fast to the track by the ice that we had to
chop for a quarter of an hour before we got
loose

  maybe it wasnt chilly to the extent of
some forty below zero when we reached the
next tank i pulled the spout down and let
the engine drink its fill then i tried to
push the spout up i say tried because i
never did push that spout up within the
same hour in which i pulled it down i did
not comprehend what had really happened
till a voice out of the blizzard cried

     its frozen fast and you cant turn off
the water and were going to lose every
gallon in the tank 

  it was the voice of superintendent davis
again

   he was right too i couldnt stop the
flow of water i couldnt raise the spout be-

cause it was frozen fast to the intake so the
water from the tank flowed on and on till
the last gill of sixty thoasand gallons left
the tank empty

  well what was the effect as fast as
the water flowed down around us it turned
to ice till we found our drivers frapped in an
iceberg four feet high

   we had to chop ourselves out with hand-
picks again this time we needed the assist-
ance of all the available section hands it
took us fully two hours to chop our drivers
free of the rails

  we proceeded once more night was
coming on fast suddenly my engineer
stopped dead and said

    a drift ahead this will about be our
finish

   it was our finish too the section-men
refused absolutely to take out the work-car
or to leave the section-house they declared
they wouldnt venture outdoors again till the
blizzard eased up a little

   thats insubordination said my engi-
neer to superintendent davis  why dont
you fire those men  

    what would be the use   mr davis re-
plied  new men would insist upon staying
in by the stove just the same as these men
are doing

    well then offer them money

  the great northern railroad and jim
hill together havent money enough to in-
duce those men to come out once they have
proclaimed their intention of staying in till
the blizzard is over

     whats to do then 

    nothing but grin and bear-till further
notice

   we backed to the nearest station and lay
there till morning by which time thqblizzard
had lost half its force and the section-men
came out and cleared the track

   let me tell you something about that drift
that may seem incredible what you think
caused it the section-foreman told us that
he was puzzled because that part of the track
lay in such a position that no drift had ever
been known to pile up at that particular
point

   when they got the track free of the drift
they discovered that it was caused by a piece
of coal no larger than an orange which had
fallen from a tender

   the snow up there is as dry as flour and
any little object on the right-of-way will start
a drift unless we find the object that
started a drift it will make trouble for trains
all winter thats why in the fall gangs
tales of the tallow-pots



it took us fully two hours to chop our drivers free of the rails

of men go over the right-of-way picking up
every stone big as a chestnut and pulling out
every weed more than two inches high

  well i reckon you can guess now that a
dakota blizzard doesnt do a thing to the
railroads

the two johns

  the convention of the brotherhood of lo-
comotive firemen and enginemen held in
st paul last summer brought delegates from
every state there were over  present-the
largest meeting the brotherhood ever held

  in addition there were some three hun-
dred wives sisters and daughters of the fire-
men present

  the result was this during the month of
june locomotive firemen wearing the badges
of their order were as thick in st paul as
colonels in kentucky while ladies wearing
the insignia of the auxiliary were as plentiful
as brides at niagara in the same month

  one day the convention was addressed by
james j hill just plain jim hill as he
was called by bill carter president of
the brotherhood who introduced the builder
of the northwest empire

  the day following mr hills address i
was standing outside the auditorium where
the convention was held talking to one of the
delegates who said

  jim hill yesterday told us firemen that
we must save our money  because he said
 the worst is yet to come in this country he
said that we must save for the sake of our
wives and children

  well jim hills remarks reminded me
of a fireman i knew in chicago his name
was john allen and he had a run on the
chicago and northwestern

   by a strange coincidence the name of
the engineer who was this firemans cab-
mate was also john allen

   john allen the fireman never would
save a cent money slipped through his
hands like gravel through a sieve one day
his engineer said to him

   john allen so long as you cant save
money why dont you carry life insurance
same as i do so as to provide for your wife
in case of accident

  john allen replied the fireman for
they always addressed each other by both
their names  whats the difference whether i


the railroad mans magazine

spend all my money for things i need and
enjoy or spend it all for insurance premiums
like you do you have never saved a cent
you hand out all your spare cash for life
insurance

  true john alien said the engineer
 but then-the more i spend in that way
now the more my wife will get when i am
numbered among the soldiers who perished
on the battlefields of the rail

  well john allen the engineer kept on
taking out more and more life insurance till
he had some thirty-five thousand dollars
worth of policies all the men of the engi-
neers brotherhood who heard of john allens
insurance habit marveled as the total grew
higher and higher

  then one day in march  along
came a life-insurance agent who found fire-
man john allen at the roundhouse and said
to him

    is this mr john allen 

    thats me replied the fireman

    well i hear you favor life insurance
now let me place before you a proposition
that you simply cant-

     hold up  cried the fireman  youve
got the wrong john allen you want that
spendthrift engineer of the same name

youll find him over there in the switchmans
shanty hes easy go after him

  the next day john allen the engineer
announced that he had taken out five thou-
sand dollars more insurance making a total
of forty thousand

    why  exclaimed the roundhouse fore-
man when he heard the news  john allen
is now the highest insured locomotive engi-
neer in the whole country-bet you anything
you like

   it was so john allen the engineer car-
ried higher life insurance than any other
man of his trade

   a few days after that the two john allens
were running their fast passenger train forty
miles an hour down near flagg illinois
when-you can guess what happened bang
into some standing freight-cars the passenger
train plunged out of it fireman john
allen emerged alive while in the wreck lay
engineer john allen dead

   and forty thousand dollars was paid by
the life-insurance companies to his widow

  a few days later fireman john allen
walked into the roundhouse and said to the
foreman

     give some one else my run to-day im
layin off

the piece of coal that made all that trouble wasnt bigger than an orange
tales of the tallow-pots



ik

and you mean to tell me youre going on your
        run now-dressed like that 

  whats ailin you asked the
foreman

     oh nothin particular im just
going to begin to-day to save a little
money by spending all i earn

  he walked thoughtfully across-
town to the office of that insurance-
agent who had mistaken him for
john allen the engineer to the
agent john allen the fireman said

     perhaps it would be just as well
if you were to let your doctor examine
me for my wifes sake just in case i
should suddenly become included
among the soldiers who perished

say john allen was a wise shrewd
far-sighted old spendthrift wasnt
he

   after the delegate to the firemans
convention finished telling me this
tale he hurried into the auditorium
only to reappear a moment later and
sing out

   hey there you that yarn i
just spun for you about the two john
allens cost me ten cents a minute

  hows that

   why we made a new rule in here
yesterday bv which any man coming
late to the daily meeting is to forfeit
half a days pay i forgot all about
it were each of us paid seven dol-
lars a day for attending the conven-
tion well i gabbed with you so
long that i got in here thirty-five minutes
late it cost me a total of three dollars fifty
-or one dime a minute and jim hill
begged us yesterday to save our money

    shut that door  yelled a delegate inside
the auditorium

a mail-clerk sleuth

  fermin keyes was a railway mail
clerk but he should have been a railroad
detective he was a born sleuth

   so said one of the visiting engineers who
though not a delegate had been attracted to
st paul by the convention

  fermin keyes was a pal of mine the
engineer continued  i had a run out of
los angeles on the southern pacific and
keyess mail-car was usually attached to my
train we traveled together a great deal his
run being between los angeles and el paso

    one day in april after pulling into the
espee depot in the city of the angels keyes
rushed up to the engine excitedly and point-
ing to one of the passengers who had just

left our train and was walking up the plat-
form said

   paul see that dapper-looking pallid-
faced weak-kneed lunger well he makes
me think of a cain

  fermin i answered what is there
about that ordinary tuberculer of which
there are billions in this southwest country
to make you think of a walking-stick  

   oh no not that kind of a cain he
said  i mean the sort of a cain that slew
abel paul im strangely interested in that
young fellow hanged if i know why hes
got a cold eye and theres something about
his general appearance that comes out and
hits me in the eye

    he boarded the train at maricopa i
noticed him and soon as i finished sorting
my mail i went into the day-coach and got
into conversation with him hes a depart-
ment-store clerk by trade-and hes come
here to los angeles looking for a job i
dont know why but im going to follow him
and see where he puts up he ran away

   i believed that railway mail-clerk to be


the railroad mans magazine

suffering from what is called a vagary-and
let it go at that

   next day however when i was about to
pull out of the espee depot keyes came up
on a run and gave me this information
paul he said i read in the newspa-
pers last night that the lunger i pointed
out to you yesterday morning is a sure
enough assassin he murdered a man over
in tucson this lunger at the time was
known as louis etinge theres a thousand
dollars reward offered for his capture say
paul im going to get that thousand good-
by

     then youre not coming on your run
to-day 

   no ive taken a lay-off to get that
thousand

    when i returned to los angeles next
dav there stood the railway mail-clerk wait-
ing for me

     im determined to get every dollar of
 that thousand all for myself he said  so i
 went to a detective agency and got sworn in
 as a regular detective ive authority to ar-
 rest my man wherever i may find him in
 california

   wheres the murderer i asked com-
ing to the point most important

     flown answered keyes  i told you
 id find out where he stopped-and i did
 i went to that place soon as i become a real
 sleuth-but he had gone yes hes gone to
 san pedro and im going to take a train
 down there immediately good-by

   well i didnt see fermin keyes again
for many days after that when he did
show up at the station he was dressed like a
tourist he carried a suit-case between
his teeth was a perfecto

      so youre back on the job are you  i
 said  and you mean to tell me youre going
 on your run dressed like that 

     run nothin he answered  im off
 on a vacation going to visit my friends in
 tucson paul i got the whole thousand

    he then told the story of how he got it
 when fermin keyes arrived at san
 pedro louis etinge had again flown after
 two days of inquiring keyes at last discov-
 ered that his quarry had taken a train to
 san diego

   down went the amateur to san diego
only to find that his man had again disap-
peared two days more of hunting and he
finally found that the murderer had shipped
for san francisco

   then keyes on a train began a race
with the steamer that was carrying his man

which one of them would get to san fran-
cisco first

   keyess train pulled into san francisco

in a cab he sped down to the wharf only to
find that the steamer from san diego had
arrived four hours before his man was
engulfed in the human maelstrom of the city

    but as i told you keyes was a born
sleuth he remembered that etinge was a
dry-goods clerk  keyes began visiting one
department store after another till-he found
louis etinge behind a counter

     cain said my friend the railway
mail-clerk to his prisoner  why did you
slay abel  

    i could plead insanity was the answer

 i was really insane you know but whats
the use im a lunger ill be dead in six
months so-whats the dif   

a smokeless test

    smokeless engine humph 

   thus exclaimed fireman ed oconnor as
he climbed aboard the locomotive to which
had been given the nickname  old iron-
sides

    sootless engine rot 

  such was the remark made by engineer
tom garland as he mounted to the cab of 
 old ironsides

  the engine in question had just come
out of the roundhouse at the stockyards
station of the chicago junction railroad

   the two men in the cab ran old ironsides
over to a siding and backed on two cars that
were to be hauled as a train these were the
superintendents inspection car in the rear
and a glass-fronted coach next to the engine
this was an observation car from which a
good view could be had of the smokeless soot-
less locomotive

   within the two cars were fifty guests of
the railroad their host was mr bristow
general attorney for the company his fifty
guests included three aldermen and forty-
seven railroad men

   the two men in the cab were joined by the
inventor of the smokeless sootless contri-
vance

   the train had run a mile or so when fire-
man oconnor suddenly sneezed so did
engineer garland so did the inventor of
tho non-smoker

   fireman oconnor sneezed a second time
and then said

   tastes like smoke to me

   engineer garland coughed choked then
gasped
tales of the tallow-pots



   smells like soot to me

  the fifty men in the observation-car all
watching the smokeless engine sneezed
coughed choked gagged and wiped tears
from their eyes and black soot from their
faces alderman stewart remarked

  thought i swallowed smoke must be
mistaken thats a smokeless engine

  the engine was belching not only volumes
of the blackest sootiest substance but also
flames the train stopped with such a sud-
den jolt that the fifty guests were flung all
over the car

  in the cab fireman oconnor finding his
mustache on fire beat the flames out with his
hands engineer garland scraped the flames

down the tracks the fifty

  they found a station

 in the cab fireman oconnor cried

  shes coming out in clouds-thickest
 smoke ive ever seen out of a stack

 after a look at his engineer and the in-
 ventor he added

  gents your faces are black with what
 looks like soot-but it cant be soot cause
 this is a sootless engine 

 in the observation-car the companys rep-
 resentative mr bristow was saying

  gentlemen wait just a moment it will
 be all right its unfortunate that this should
 happen but im sure its only some temporary
 trouble weve been running this engine for
 six months without smoke or soot

 just then one of the aldermen cried
 fire

from his hair the inventor tenderly felt
his blistered face

  oconnor cried were on fire stop her
garland 

  the fifty guests piled out and formed a
bucket brigade

  the engine-curtain was blazing furiously
the brigade extinguished the flames the
coal in the forward part of the tender was
cackling as if in a fire-box the volunteer
fire department threw water on the burning
coal

  then the inventor said

   gentlemen you must not judge my
smokeless engine by this test my contri-
vance can be fitted to any locomotive furnace
boiler or stove it has been tested success-


the railroad mans magazine

fully many times in the last six months it
is a genuine wonder 

hes right put in mr bristow the gen-
eral attorney for the railroad company  all

  they left fireman oconnor and engineer
garland standing by the half-burned  old
ironsides applying wet handkerchiefs to
their scorched faces

they saw the engineer walk a little
way up the track and sit down
on a tie alongside of a woman
and two children

 sootless engine rot  exclaimed
garland as he bandaged his forehead

 smokeless engine humph  grunt-
ed oconnor as he fumbled with the re-
maining half of his mustache

fireman bert was on the head end of
the  hog train  with engineer kimball
as their train pulled across illinois between
quincy and havana the fireman said to the
engineer

  kim what were you spouting about last
night at your brotherhood meeting sorno-
thing about wanting to lay a matter before
governor dineen-something about locomo-
tive boilers 

  boiler inspection replied kimball

  the train was nearing havana and the
engineer eased up so as to take the hog
train  in on a walk

   yes boiler inspection kimball contin-
ued what i said was that we need state

r

thats the matter to-day is a defective flue
that clogged the air-valves and threw the
gases generated by fire into the cab and-
say interrupted one of the aldermen
wheres the nearest station at which we can
get an engine that smokes and flings forth
soot-just normal smoke and just every-day
soot we want it to take us back to town
down the track walked the fifty guests till
they found a station

  they boarded a train hauled by an engine
that was neither smokeless nor sootless
with them went the singed and blistered in-
ventor and the coughing railroad attorney
tales of the tallow-pots



inspection of locomotive boilers there are
federal inspectors of steamship boilers and
there are city inspectors of boilers in cities
why shouldnt there be state inspectors of
locomotive boilers we need em i tell you
wouldnt i like to get a private word with
governor dineen on that subject

   have you ever seen the governor  

  no but id know him from his picture
all right if ever i should run across him i
bet i could convince him that it is his duty
to start something in the legislative line that
would lead to the appointment of state in-
spectors of boilers

  the  hog train  pulled into havana and
out again and proceeded leisurely toward
pekin suddenly it halted

  passengers thrust their heads out of the
windows to see what caused the stop

  the engineer jumped off his cab walked
up track and sat down on a tie alongside of
a woman and two children

  passengers then fded out of the coaches
and went forward and met fireman bert

   what we stopping for  

  family discussion replied the fireman
  whose family

   the engineers thats his wife and kids
hes talkin to

  land sakes whats his family doing
here 

   his wife is going shopping and needs
some money she signaled to him to stop
hi there engineer called one of the
passengers  get a skate on  

   just a moment kimball called back
expectant silence reigned a moment among
the impatient passengers during which they
heard mrs kimball say

  well shall i paper the kitchen or white-
wash it

  a passenger braver than his fellows said
to kimball

   engineer you should have some consid-
eration for others sir

   exactly what im doing replied kim-
ball  im having consideration for my
wife

  the important-looking man received this
rebuke with a smile then strolled back to
the coaches

  at the same time one of the passengers
said something in a low tone to fireman
bert

  you dont say exclaimed the fireman
he too smiled

  after deciding that it would be cheaper to
whitewash the kitchen engineer kimball
rose and the  hog train  proceeded

  when the train pulled into pekin the
important-looking man came to the engine
and reached up his hand to the engineer
saying

  let us shake hands mister i thank you
for carrying me safely and with a broad
smile  as expeditiously as your family mat-
ters would permit good luck to you 

   same to you old man replied engineer
kimball taking the proffered hand  be
good to yourself he added  and remember
that in considering the welfare of others a
man should think of his wife first

  when the important-looking man walked
away kimball saw his fireman shaking with
laughter holding a wad of waste over his
mouth to muffle his chuckling

   what you snickerin about  asked kim-
ball  and say what did that duffer shake
hands with me for hes a queer dub

   you wanted a chance for a private word
with the governor of illinois didnt you
kim asked fireman bert

   sure

  well youve had two of the bulliest
chances for a private word with him that
youll ever get that hand-shaker was gov-
ernor dineen

  engineer kimball collapsed on his seat and
kept from fainting only by fanning himself
vigorously with his cap
  silent jim

by leslie curtis

      written for  the railroad mans magazine

co youre a brand-new fireman and youre lookin for silent jim

      youre green all right for every man on this trunk line knows him
transferred from the lackawanna well i dont envy you none

if youre goin to fire for silent jim-its a mighty lonesome run

jims due here any minute now set down and take a quid

ive half a notion to put you wise you aint much moren a kid
dont chew well roll a cigarette theres nmkins in the pouch

but dont get sore at silent jim it isnt a case of grouch

its purty nigh eighteen years ago-he was only a fireman then

every one called him sunny jim he was popular with the men

always happy and smilin and say but he married a prize

purty and cute-a pippin-with regular pansy eyes

one day he came to the roundhouse handin out sheepish grins

we couldnt savvy the reason till he told us that it was twins

so the boys went up to the house that night to look at the little things
most every one of us loaded down with rattles and teethin-rings

while we was standin around the room laughin and kiddin jim

his wife jest opened them pansy eyes and held out her arms to him

we filed out sort of embarrassed like and nothin much was said-

but next day down at the roundhouse we heard that the wife was dead

well jim came back to the run again lookin as white as chalk

we shook his hand and it meant a lot we hadnt the nerve to talk

he sent the twins to his folks down south or so the women heard

for since that day hes been silent jim-never speakin a word

just notice sometime about three miles out a graveyard on a hill

if youve got sand to look around theres tears on the window-sill

and always that awful silence well  dont envy you none-

here comes jim now luck to you kid its a mighty lonesome run
the a p circuit

          by george gilbert

        old pop murphy tells of the time when
        he saved the honor of the service

w-ew lights were burning in the
big main room of the eastern
jmaf united telegraph companys
office and few brazen tongues
clicked between brazen lips of
sounders the wheatstone
circuits were still the local and way wires
were all deserted

  here and there a through wire sputtered
but the bonus men on the boston  quad 
still kept up their  message - a - minute 
average under the stimulus of increased earn-
ings at the big switchboard an incandes-
cent gleamed occasionally to lure the night
chief on to test for the swing that had
bothered a suburban wire during the rush
hours of the evening while over in the east
corner of the repeater gallery old pop mur-
phy spare of frame keen of eye bald of
head with scanty bristling mustache quiv-
ering with the nervous tension under which
he was laboring tended the  peters  of the
a p circuit

  from helix-screw to armature adjustment
his hand wandered while he anxiously
watched the flickering sparks as they glim-
mered between the platinum of  the points
down across the jersey meadows a fog hung
heavy and the conditions were ideal for the
formation of weather crosses making the cur-
rent vary with each change in the variant
winds

  because the insurgents had chased the reg-
ulars in washington that day the a p
washington report was heavy and impor-
tant and must be coaxed through from south
to north from coast to coast that newspaper
readers might learn of the latest riffle in mer-
cerized insurrection in the halls of congress

  when the company had an emergency of
that sort when all other repeater men failed
in the nicety of their adjustments old pop-
who had handled the first set of repeaters

ever made who knew all there was to know
of practise and theory in that line when to
jam the armatures close to the magnets
when to tighten the armature springs and
when to throw in or out extra battery on
either side-was invaluable

  because he could cajole a presidents mes-
sage out of the fog or sneak the dots and
dashes of a string of difficult cipher mes-
sages past the interference of an aurora his
grip-stricken arm was no longer called upon
to do the arduous work of transmitting he
enjoyed a pensioners status with the com-
pany

  as i listened to the rhythmic swing of the
beautifully coded morse fleeting west to chi-
cago and the coast and east to boston and the
new england states i caught as it were an
undertone of dots and dashes-thin clear
and ghost-like in their quality

  a buffalo wire was connected with the
instruments on the table back of me the
sounder was silent but from the table itself
the weird tapping came but its weirdness
was not new to me

  somewhere in the maze of wires to the
west this wire was near another and across
the gap leaped the mystic waves which
telegraphers call  induction causing one
wire to vibrate with the impulses carried by
another as one tuning-fork responds to the
harmonics of its neighbor leaning my head
on the table from whence the induction came
i heard

 ach	wr	 paid

       union stock yards chicago iii

  arment  co portland me

    maiacos lyngyrium car -

  then the induction faded i had heard
a portion of the chicago beef-ciphers as they
came swinging out of the west to the car-
icing stations


the railroad mans magazine

   murphy i asked  what is induc-
tion  

   tis the forerunner of the wireless
said die veteran

   tis waves of some sort that separate
themselves from the wire they belong to and
mix in on another wire where they have 
business to be 

   listen to the swing of that fellows stuff
in washington he said  by the fairy-
ring of kilroe his arm could pound morse
through a wire that reached to the planet
mars tis not so fast but clear and plain
and he does not overrun his copy he makes
less noise than some but lie gets the copy over
the wire

   he would not get much over the wire to-
night i said  without your hand to ease it
over the peter-points

    let be let be said the old man though
he was pleased with the compliment

  again the induction murmured its elfin
undertone murphy cocked an ear toward
the table from which it came

   i mind once when induction saved a man
from disgrace and a woman from suicide he
said

   i waited patiently for the tale

  heard ye ever of billy hubson once
champion sender of the world  

  i had who had not

   he had a peculiar way of gripping his
key said murphy not with a full grip
but with a loose wrist and wide-open points
two fingers on the inner edge of the key-
knob and his thumb clear his dots were
like wheatstone and his dashes just enough
longer than the dots to make his morse a
marvel of sweetness to the ear it was easier
to take him forty words a minute than any
other man at thirty

   once you heard his stuff going over the
wire you could always recognize it exactly
as you could a friends voice over the tele--
phone it sounded fine and manly like
himself

  n y n y n y q d q d
called washington

    i i q d answered old pop his grip-
stricken wrist wabbling like a hens foot as
he answered the new york peter-call known
the world over to all sons of morse

  west says im coming heavy said
washington

  for a moment murphy was busy with his
adjustments and then the a p report went
joyfully on again

  ill not describe hubson to you said
the veteran because its only bis style of

brass-pounding that figures in this story of
mine

   about the time hubson won his gold
medal for sending fifty-two words a minute
uncoded in the big tournament a nice-look-
ing little chap blew into  one day and
struck the chief for a job he had come
from a way-railroad station up in connect-
icut and his name was janies cargan

  now cargan was a sprig of a man with
a smooth round peachy face dainty hands
a wisp of a mustache and pale-blue eyes
something in the droop of his under lip was
not favorable but he had a ready tongue
and a nice easy way and before long he was
off the carpet before the chief and onto a
wire

  first off they put him on a way-wire
near my table as they have many a young-
ster that i might note the quality of his copy
and sending typewriters were just coming
into fashion then but cargan needed none
he wrote like a whirlwind and every word
looked as if it came out of a copy-book

    hell do said i to mckenna the traffic
chief  he will be fit for the oil city du-
plex in a month so he got the job 

  when i went back to my table there
was a man standing behind cargan listening
to his wire soon this man beckoned across
the room to another fellow and he came
across the second man was ned wilson
a watery-eyed spindle-shanked wizened-up
scot who worked in pool-rooms and brokers
offices when lie could and in commercial of-
fices when he had to just now he had to do
the latter because he had lost a good pool-
room job through drink the two men stood
back of cargan a while

    watch his grip said the first man a
stranger to me

   wilson looked at cargan and listened

    he has the hubson grip said wilson

   i noticed it the lad had his key held
as hubson held his and his sending sound-
ed enough like hubsons to be the same

  the stranger turned around and saw me
he looked me in the eye a moment and then
looked away a man who cannot look an-
other in the eye steadily is thinking bad
thoughts the stranger had black hair dark
eyes and a beard that made his face look
blue where the close-shaven hairs pricked
through he was big and burly

    whos your friend  i asked wilson

  ren mahone said the scot just in
from frisco looking for a sit

  pleased to see you i said lying as
i said it for he was a far-down if ever a
the a t circuit



man was and small use have high-up irish-
men for the far-downs

    they went out and i took notice of car-
gan there he was not minding anything
in the world but his wire and happy to have
a job in the big  office and sure as i
am alive he was sending like hubson

  out of a million telegraphers no two
have the same swing to their morse but he
was the millionth and one in all my ex-
perience i never heard the like of it he had
the speed the accurate touch the judgment
only one thing did i notice different and
that was when he sent the word  the he
jambed it a bit on the front of the following
word whatever it was a thing hubson never
did

  w b w b bk bk bk called chi-
cago on the west wire murphy leaned over
the west repeater lovingly and chicago
morsed a complaint to him washington
too light he said

    i i said murphy and then he straight-
ened out the bug

   to resume said pop  cargan soon
fitted himself into the office like a piece of
apparatus he was early to work and eager
to  wolf  the extra time he was making
money and friends and soon the girls on the
city wires and short circuits where women
do best had their eyes on him

   best of all was he known to agnes
danaher a pretty slip of a jersey girl who
worked the cotton local she was a sweet
creature with a rosebud mouth blue eyes
deep brown hair and dainty

   unto her cargan clung so earnestly that
the other girls teased her about him

   one afternoon as i was balancing up
the philadelphia quad for the chief of the
south board who should come sidling up to
me but agnes danaher her lips were quiv-
ering and her eyes were ready to brim over

     pop she says  when you see me go
for the elevator to-night come after me and
talk to me in the hall before i could turn
she was gone but soon across the room i
caught the clacking of her sounder it had
an agate sound that made it easy to pick
out of the roar of a thousand hammerings
in all parts of the room

  i had her words in mind all afternoon
and when i saw her go out i made bold to
impose on my chiefs good nature and fol-
lowed her although i was not through my
trick

  in a corner of the hall i found her

 what is it agnes  i coaxed

  tis about ned wilson she said i

am afraid of him and ben mahone thats
come from frisco

     what have they said to you   i asked
hot with rage to think of them even speaking
to a decent girl

   nothing said she but they are after
mr cargan every little while and i saw
them whispering to him on the corner last
night when i came out he was to take me
home and he turned away from me as if
he were ashamed and let me go home alone
 i will look into this i said  i like it
no better than you do

   mckenna said i to the traffic chief
next day  where is that ben mahone from
frisco who wanted the job here not long
ago

   hes over in hoboken said the chief
 they were short of men over there and i
sent him over

    t like him not says i

    no more do i says mckenna  but he
serves to work a wire

    i cast my eye for wilson and there he
was over in the far corner where the jersey
wires came in i edged near him and heard
him call hoboken

    is that vcu ben he asked

  i i said hoboken

   thinks i to myself thinks i ill hear
what you two say but wilson muffled his
sounder with his hand and began to send
when it came hobokens turn wilson kept
the sounder still but let the relay armature
tip play against his thumbs edge and so got
the morse silent and sure reading it by touch
and not sound-a trick not many can do

    time for me to play tricks too said i
thinking to save agnes danahers beau from
i knew not what it was before hugh grant
chopped the poles off all the streets and put
the wires under ground and the roof was a
mass of wires and cables going to the
switchboard i grabbed a box relay set and
edged quietly out into the hall and climbed to
the roof

   on the roof was casey the trouble
chaser  your diagram of the jersey grape-
vine circuits  says i  the chief wants me
to make a few tests here

  out came his diagram open went the
cable box and soon i had my set clicking
away on  jersey

    cargan promised me this morning
wired wilson in his jerky slovenly fashion
like peas rattling in a pan  that he would
work it to-morrow

o k came back from mahone over in
hoboken they stopped and began sending


the railroad mans magazine

die eastern unions own business as they
should have been all along

  lii what did cargan promise him  i said
out loud

     how do i know said casey looking on
me as one daft

   tim casey said i  you have a brass
head and a pea for a heart-and mind your
own business

     youre daft man said casev throwing
his pliers at me just as i went through the
scuttle hole of the roof

  we had heavy work that night the
newspaper wires were full of advance stories
of the big guttenberg race that was to be
run next day the lexow investigation had
driven most of the pool-rooms out of new
york but those that were left were making
big money and all over the country

   the tip was out that candelabrum was
to win the race and his closing odds were 
to  and then  out  altogether the closing
of the pool-rooms in new york had adver-
tised the racing game all over the country
because the newspapers had been carrying
pool-rooms in the head-lines for weeks and
that made thousands of people who otherwise
never would have thought of a bet on a race
otherwise i watched the repeaters in my
division that night i planned to put down
some of my over-time money so i looked over
the odds

   candelabrum at  to  i saw and i re-
member now no other horse in the gutten-
berg plate that year save yellow tail he
was at the tail of the list and he stood
 to 

    to think my ten dollars might be a thou-
sand if i bet on him and he won and the
pool-room didnt bust before i got the mon-
ey but i had better sense than to play
those long shots

   while i was sitting there away from
everybody the wires got quiet as they will
at times even in the midst of a busy day
now late at night the lull came with a queer
suddenness

  i was wondering what was wrong when i
heard an induction on the very table where
i sat to which a buffalo wire was connected
it was an old erie wire over the old re-
liable clear across the state-a rusty old
iron string no one would use now when
copper is none too good a bad reputation old
 erie had for  bugs and weather crosses
of all sorts i bent mv head to the table to
see what the old witch was yammering about
and what waves she was stealing from her
betters when i heard this message

                        hoboken june 
  james switzer hotel weatherbee wilkes-
  barre pennsylvania

     put all on the plate everything fixed get
   away as soon as you get official

                       n e o mabhen

   then came another to a buffalo address
and one to chicago and all in the same words
and all signed the same idly i wrote that
queer signature on a message blank and
studied it as i did so the induction stopped
and the old erie  was unbewitched

  the a p circuits speed increased as
he saw  in sight the operator at wash-
ington settled to his work his morse sound-
ed clear and sweet in an increasingly stac-
cato crescendo

  murphy listened appreciatively  theres
music he said  if i had time i could
demonstrate to you that the continental code
is hog latin and the morse code the language
of the angels above he mused awhile be-
fore taking the thread of his tale

   all next day i kept wondering about the
odd signature to those messages that went out
of hoboken when i got that induction cross

  it kept bothering my head allmorning
and in the afternoon as i set up the  peters 
for the race wires i kept thinking of it
when we got the guttenberg wire going she
began to snap like wildfire and in a second
i threw open the key and asked

    hubson how did you come to get down
there to-day  for it was hubson the worlds
champion sender

   hallo murph he answered  i just
blew in from the south and mckenna sent
me here to handle the guttenberg stuff

     says i

    soon i got a call to the switchboard and
there chief mckenna warned me

    murphy says he  we have it from
our secret service that the big butch gang
of wire tappers will try to pull off something
big on the guttenberg plate race to-day- a
lot of advance money is saiji to be on yel-
low tail in the early pool-room hooks and
he has no show to win

  i sent hubson a message at jackson-
ville five days ago to come up to send the
guttenberg stuff to-day and we have good
men at relay points who know each others
sending and whom we can trust

  if anything goes wrong it will go
wrong between this office and  the gut 
track you know hubsons stuff over the
wire and for the honor of the service i ask
you to be watchful to-day

    i gave my promise and i kept it but
the a p circuit



not in the way he meant but then i did not
know that i would create an evasion to save
two souls from ruin

   back to the guttenberg wire i went
anxious as a hen for her chickens to hatch
hubson was sending the preliminary race
gossip-the  guff  we call it after he had
sent a few items and the betting odds at that
time half an hour before the races began
the wire stopped for perhaps half a minute
 i noticed that was queer then listened

     the track is fast began the next item
of guff the way that  the  was hooked on-
to the following word caught my ear quick
as a flash things pieced themselves together
in my mind i looked over to the oil city
wire where cargan should be and he was
gone i looked over in the corner where
wilson should be and he was gone

   i remembered that signature on the in-
duction messages i had heard from ho-
boken the night before and i wrote it out
again  n e o mabhen 

   it was  ben mahone  in cipher i
knew nothing would go wrong before the
races began so i went over to the hoboken
main wire and asked if mahone was in the
office he was not

  then i went back and sat down again
it was clear to me cargan had been picked
by the gang of wire tappers to send the race
news that day from a wire-tappers station
between new york and  the gut

   it was the old game the wire was to be
 grounded  at the wire-tappers station
hubson was to keep sending what he sent
would be repeated word for word until it
came time to send the winner and official
confirmation of the race they had planned to
make their killing on and then the name of a
fake winner would be substituted and the
rest of the races sent ok

   the pool-rooms all over the country
would pay off and the gangs cappers in half
a hundred cities would make a huge killing
and then fade away if hubson asked the
receivers in the race-news section a question
or they had anything to send him the tappers
would throw a switch and he would get it

   the wire-tappers had a copy of the mes-
sage ordering hubson from jacksonville to
guttenberg they knew that he would not
sell out for love or money but they had
planned to stall him by putting cargan his
wire double at the key of that  tap-plant

    no sooner had i arranged this in my head
than i heard a sigh behind me i turned
and there was agnes danalier she was
listening to  the gut  wire

    i saw in the flash that she knew all about
it  agnes said i  come here now tell
me what is really on your mind

    we were alone behind a big pillar at tire
far end of the room no one was noticing us

     that is james cargan she said point-
ing to the instruments that were clicking out
his shame  he told me all about it last
night and swore me to secrecy she said in
broken whispers  he stands to gain one
thousand dollars for this days work

   and why didnt a decent girl like you
tell some one  i asked angrily

   she turned red and then white  he is
too much to me she said

     too much or too little said i  you
should expose a skinner like that

     oh pop she cried  i love james car-
gan and i cannot have him go to prison
dont tell any one-i want to marry him

    go back to your wire and work with
what nerve you have left said i  and if
this man can be saved ill do it not for him
but for you

   she went and i began to cudgel my
brains here i was with the honor of the
service in my hands agnes danahers secret
in my keeping and the ears of the keenest
men in the service on me but none of them
had ever noticed that cargan jammed his
 thes  onto the following word when he sent
not much did he jam it but enough for me
to know he could fool ten thousand oper-
ators but not me

    listened to his stuff i knew that hub-
sons sending was being relayed in some
cellar or garret or sewer-holc between 
and  the gut and was being passed
through tainted hands to the outer world
that was betting its good money on candela-
brum while a cheap skate would win

   then i formed my plan i chuckled
inside to think of how easy it would be to
save the foolish young man and at the same
time hurt the wire-tappers in the sorest spot
-the pocket-nerve

    in my pocket i chanced to have a bit of
small flexible wire this i attached to the
 binding post  of the relay on the jersey side
of the race  peters i let the other end
dangle right over the  ground  wire  binding
post andthen i was ready to split the wire
myself whenever i wanted to without throw-
ing the  ground  switch if mckenna came
-a snatch and the wire would go crumpled
inside my pocket

   so i waited the plate race was the
third the first and second went all right
for i knew that the gang would not try to


the railroad mans magazine

      i	

work their game on but one race-wire-tap-
pers never do

   after the second race  the gut  wire lay
idle after die post odds and the corrected
list of jockeys and weights were sent

    theyre at the post signaled cargan
repeating the dash he had stolen from hubson

  then i put the ground on and held
it that put the wire  dead  on the other
side of die  peters but i could hear on the
jersey side every word that cargan said i
had tapped the wire to save one wire-tapper
and break financially the rest soon car-
gan clicked  theyre off at  the gut 
but it never got to the wires of the racing
section he began die description of the race
candelabrum first yellow tail second

   i saw mckenna start away from the
switchboard he came part way and shouted
 anything wrong on the gut wire

   i held my nerve well for agnes danahers
sake and for the honor of die service

  no sir i said probably they are
long in getting awav

   i felt like a whipped cur for lying

   i turned to cargans side of the wire
while the race-section side lay dead

    they are in the stretch he signaled
 yellow tail leads by a head-by half a
length with candelabrum second and jim
daly third-dot-dot-long dash yellow
tail wins by a scant length  he flashed into
my dumb grounded wire

  i laughed to think of it he gave the
time and in two seconds more the official
confirmation then my finger went to the
armature spring on  the gut  side of the
wire and i felt it flutter that meant that
cargan had taken the wire-tappers instru-
ments off and that once again i had a straight
wire to guttenberg with the real hubson at
the end

   the fool thought the gang had made its
killing and he was dusting out of the tap-
pers crib to save his hide i had just time
to snatch the  ground  wire and crumple it
into my pocket when chief mckenna came
booming toward me down the side aisle of
tables just as he got to me hubson began
the  guff for the fourth race as mckenna
heard it he gave a roar

  where is the third race he signaled

    didnt you get it  asked hubson

   not a tick said mckenna

  there was some trouble on the jersey

  the walschaert valve-gear

by robert h rogers

while locomotives have been growing larger and more powerful year by
year necessitating heavier parts and stronger construction one factor that
has not changed in the slightest degree since the adoption of the standard
gage is the length of an engines driving axles four eccentrics crowded closely
together between the frames where they are almost inaccessible to the engineer and
difficult to keep properly lubricated soon set engine-builders to looking about for
a better mechanism to open and close the steam-ports it was not until they ex-
perimented with the invention of a belgian shop superintendent that they discov-
ered the solution for which they were looking

     the walschaert valve-gear has been tried with the greatest success on all the
heavier types of passenger and freight locomotives both in this country and europe
it is rapidly displacing its predecessor-the stephenson link motion-on account of
its smoothness of action and the ease with which it may be repaired

     mr rogers whose experience as a master mechanic has rendered him an ex-
cellent judge of the merits of this up-to-date mechanism has given us a thorough
explanation of all its details with some hints for use in cases of breakdown

the operation construction and maintenance of egide walschaerts remark-
able invention showing its many points of superiority over
the old-time stephenson link motion

students of locomotive lore are well ac-
quainted with the fact that many of its most
prized details to-day had their beginnings
years ago and that between them and the
present a period of nearly half a century
ensued during which they fell either into dis-
repute or were forgotten familiar illustra-
tions are the bushed-side rods the brass end-
play liner on driving-boxes and the now



       luriously enough locomotive
development appears to mature
in grand cycles instead of em-
bodying a steady and unfalter-
ing progress which might log-
ically be expected to follow the
conception of a machine which stands unique
in that it received immediate recognition as
the one great solution of land-transportation

    this motion particularly appeals through the presence of a relatively small number of parts
and because all of these parts are on the outside of the locomotive whereas in the stephenson
link motion the parts are all underneath and between the frames the walschaert gear thus
embodies undisputed points of superiority in ease of inspection and accessibility to repairs

fig i-the stephenson link motion

    this is the general arrangement of the valve-gear which for nearly three-quarters ot a cen-
tury appealed to american practise as the most logical solution of the slide-valve problem it
will be noted that two eccentrics are required one for either direction in which it is desired to
run the locomotive whereas in its successor the walschaert illustrated above but one eccentric
is necessary and that the entire motion is on the outside of the engine instead of underneath it
as in the instance of this motion

universal  sharpshooter or straight smoke-
stack

  ross winans the famous baltimore rail-
road man and engine builder employed these
latter devices on his  camel-back  locomo-
tives in the early days of the baltimore and
ohio railroad all of them and many more
dropped out of sight only to return again
unto their own and in all probability they
are with us now to stay until steam traction
is supplanted forever by some other form of
motive-power

  it is not so generally known however

that the now much exploited walschaert
valve-gear undoubtedly the most practical
solution of the slide - valve problem ever
presented is also one of these resurrected
items from the now nearly forgotten days

  startling as this novel design may appear
in contrast to the time-honored stephenson
link motion which served effectually until
the century-mark had been nearly reached
in its history and notwithstanding the ama-
zing rapidity which has characterized its in-
troduction into american practise during the
past half dozen years the fact remains that
the walschaert valve-gear



there is nothing new about it on the con-
trary it is quite ancient older than the mo-
tion which it is fast supplanting and indeed
almost as old as the locomotive engine itself

  stephenson bought the shifting-link valve-
gear which erroneously bears  his name
from william howe the true inventor one
of his pattern-makers of newcastle eng-
land in s stephenson practically pirated
this invention inasmuch as he allowed howe
but twenty guineas for the idea lock stock
and barrel

  the latter failed to perceive the value of
his ingenious model until after the sale had
been consummated and retired into obscur-
ity while stephenson hastened its applica-
tion to every locomotive subsequently turned
out from his works and so diffused the idea
that it remained the standard at least in
american practise until 

  in the meantime and coincident with the
experiments of howe and stephenson the
invention destined after sixty-six years to
succeed their shifting-link motion was born
in the state railway shops at malines bel-
gium in  it did not receive the spon-
taneous acclaim which heralded the valve-
gear with which we have been most familiar
but that he who evolved it builded even better
than he knew is well evinced by the tremen-
dous popularity which it now enjoys

  egide walschaert the inventor was born
in  at mechlin then a little retired vil-
lage in the vicinity of brussels the railway
line from brussels to malines was opened
in  and that decided the career of young
walschaert who entered the malines railway
shops in 

walschaerts patent

  his wonderful aptitude for locomotive
problems is illustrated in the fact that in two
years he became chief superintendent of the
shops of the brussels southern road and at
the early age of twenty-four had already ac-
quired to an eminent degree all the qualities
which go to majte a successful engineer
these sterling qualifications should have
secured to him the position of technical di-
rector of the systems locomotive service but
it is humiliating to state that he remained
chief shop superintendent all the remaining
active years of his life

  on october   m fischer engineer
of the state railways at brussels made an
application in the name of egide walschaert
for a patent of an invention relating to a
new valve-gear for locomotives this bel-

gian patent was accorded by royal decree on
november   for a term of fifteen
years the rules of the railway company
did not allow foremen of shops to advertise
a patent in belgium to their benefit and this
explains perhaps the part played by m
fischer who however never laid any claim
to the invention

  the mechanism described in the patent of
s presents a strong resemblance to that
which has at present come into its long-de-
layed appreciation and the inventor con-
structed in  a similar valve motion for
application to locomotive no  at that
time the valve-gear in use was that of sharp
with two eccentrics and the usual forked
rods



won early success in europe

  as has been mentioned the shifting link
attributed to stephenson had been invented
by howe in  and it is therefore doubt-
ful if walschaert had ever seen it before his
own patent was granted he also invented a
valve-gear for stationary engines somewhat
on the corliss or sulzer principle and he
built at brussels a shop for the manufacture
of these engines which was managed by his
son

  although recognition of the splendid
qualities of the walschaert valve-gear has
been tardy in this country it must not be
assumed that the inventor passed unhonored
through his long and useful life at the
paris exposition of  a gold medal was
awarded him for his engine and in 
the exposition at antwerp awarded him a
diploma of honor in which his locomotive
valve-gear was given merited praise

  walschaert died on february   at
st lilies near brussels at the age of eighty-
one years his reputation however great
was accepted with singular modesty and his
business relations were met with absolute
disinterestedness

  he gave his remarkable invention to the
world at a time when the study of steam dis-
tribution and valve-gears was in its infancy
and he was deprived of the resources of a sci-
ence which was not yet developed on ac-
count of his great merits it is unfortunate
that proper justice has not always been ac-
corded walschaert as the ingenious mechan-
ism which was original with him lias been
purloined for long years in the greater part
of europe he passed away just three years
before the first valve-gear which bears his
name made its advent into the united states


the railroad mans magazine

  prior to  the exclusive valve motion
in this country if not in the entire western
hemisphere was that of the stephenson link
it had seemingly proved to be the survival of
the fittest well exemplified in
the fact that it was embodied in
 upward of  locomotives

 fig  -draftsmans plot of stephenson gear 

     this diagram represents the scheme to scale for one side
 of an ordinary locomotive equipped with the stephenson link
 motion the motion of the latter is complex to a degree and
 infinite care must be exercised in its laying out before the
 drawings are finally prepared for shop use they are usually
 proved on a full-sized mode of all the parts

  it is assumed for the sake of this article
which is intended to be explanatory of the
walschaert gear that the stephenson link
motion is understood by its readers it may
however be well to briefly define the problem
which presents in the instance of any valve-
gear in order that the points of superiority
attained by the walschaert may be fully ap-
preciated

the stephenson link motion

  locomotives are propelled by the to-and-
fro motion of the pistons in the cylinders
communicated to the driving-wheels through
the medium of connecting parts viz cross-
heads and rods to insure this to-and-fro
or reciprocating action of the pistons the
steam must be alternately admitted and dis-
charged from either end of the cylinders

  this latter distribution is effected by a
slide or piston-valve which is the same for
any style of valve-gear and in which the
point to be aimed at is to secure an ease of
movement with the least multiplicity of
parts every motion must necessarily em-
body the reversible as well as the forward
feature in order that the locomotive may be
propelled in either direction at the will of
the operator

  in the stephenson link motion the general
arrangement of which for one side of the
engine is shown in figure  two eccentrics

are employed for each cylinder one of these
is fixed or keyed on the main driving axle or
shaft in such a position as to move die valve
so that the engine will run in one direction
and the other eccentric is set so that the en-
gine will run the reverse way

the ends of each pair of

  	eccentric-rods  c  and  d

  are attached to what is called
  a link  k the object of
  which is to furnish the means
  of quickly engaging or dis-
  engaging either eccentric-rod
  to or from the rocker m
  the rocker in turn is -con-
  nected to the main valves
  through the medium of the
  valve-stem  s

  it will be noted in the
sketch that the link is sus-
pended by a bar  g called
the link-hanger to the end of
the lifting shaft-arm  e
this shaft has an upright
arm to which is connected
the reach-rod r and this
in turn to the reverse lever in the cab

  in figure  the stephenson link motion is
depicted in full go-ahead or forward
gear that is entirely under the influence of
the go-ahead eccentric which in this case is
the eccentric marked  j should it be de-
sired to reverse the position of the valve not
shown in the drawing it is effected by pull-
ing the reverse lever and this through the
medium of the reach-rod and the pivoted
point a of the lifting shaft raises the
link until actuated by the  back-up  ec-
centric h

where walschaerts gear excels

  from this brief description it is apparent
that two sets of the above apparatus are re-
quired on each locomotive one for each side
any locomotive being necessarily two dis-
tinct engines although the adjustment of
the valve-gear is such that their action is
harmonious consequently the stephenson
link motion in entirety embodies four eccen-
trics with their rods and straps two links
two link-hangers and a lifting shaft extend-
ing across the engine with two arms one for
each link

  this is the valve-gear which was solely in
use n this country for sixty-seven years and
probably would have retained supremacy had
not the tremendous strides of the last few
years in increasing the size of locomotives
the walschaert valve-gear



 dictated its retirement in favor of the wals-
 chaert

   it will be noted that the stephenson link
 motion is entirely underneath the locomotive
 between the two frames this did not prove
 a serious objection while the parts remained
 light in weight and their size could be re-
 stricted to reasonable proportions

   in the modern locomotive however it be-
 came necessary to have them of such size that
 there is scarcely room enough for the four
 eccentrics on the same axle between the
 frames they are crowded together so that
 it is practically impossible for the engineer
 to give them the lubrication and inspection
 which hard service demands the wals-
 chaert gear however being outside the en-
 gine in its entirety see fig  is per-
 fectly accessible and can therefore be much
 more easily maintained

   the stephenson link under the influence
 of two eccentrics moves through wide angles
 resulting in a wedging action of the link-
 block which strains the gear and produces
 lost motion the walschaert link driven
 by a single eccentric moves through smaller
 angles and produces less lost motion

   bv removing the valve-gear from between
 the frames as has been done in the instance
 of the walschaert gear a better opportunity
 is afforded to strengthen the frames through
 cross braces which the regular link motion
 prohibits and thus the possibility of frame
 breakages is reduced

   the walschaert gear also shows a distinct
 advantage over the stephenson link motion
 as regards permanence of adjustment when
 a heavy freight-engine is half-way between
 shoppings the stephenson link motion is
 slack and loose while the walschaert valve-
 gear is in practically as good condition as
 when it left the shop there
 being no large eccentrics to
 keep lubricated and its -
 hardened pins and bush-
 ings are valuable adjuncts

   these are some of the reasons why a large
 number of american railroads are now
 equipping their engines with the walschaert
 valve-gear seldom in the history of the de-
 velopment of the locomotive in this country
 has any improvement once introduced been
 so rapidly accepted as has this type of valve
 motion and inasmuch as its use will un-
 doubtedly increase a clear understanding of
 the elements at least of its construction and
 operation will be expected from those who
 operate and maintain engines so equipped

details of construction

   in order that a clear understanding be at-
 tained of this mechanism it is thought ad-
 visable to present the subject with the as-
 sistance of a few simple sketches and in
 these all elaboration of detail has been omit-
 ted to prevent any possible confusion of the
 central idea some of the parts have been
 much exaggerated in comparative size for
 the sake of clearness but fidelity has been
 strictly adhered to in the outline and propor-
 tion of the connecting parts the combined
 action of which produces the motion desired

   referring to fig  in which is illustrated
 the outline diagram of this motion it will be
 noted that the walschaert gear derivesits
 motion from an eccentric - crank or return
 crank on the main crank-pin the rod from
 this eccentric-crank is secured to one end of
 the link which is pivoted in the center on a

pin lield by a bracket bolted to the guide
yoke in the completed form these parts are
also illustrated in fig  which represents
the application of this gear to a consolidation
engine

   the link-block is secured to the radius-
arm or bar one end of which is attached to
the end of the valve-rod or stem so-called
and the other end to the lifting arm of the
reverse shaft- it will also be noted that the
valve-rod is attached to a lever which de-
rives its motion from the cross-head this
last detail determines the lap and the lead of
the valve and gives them a fixed value
whereas the stephenson link motion gives a
variable lap and lead affected by the valve
travel

gets motion from two sources

  the motion imparted to the valve by the
cross-head connection however is small as
the cross-head arm and the lap-and-lead
connector are attached to the lower end of the
lap-and-lead lever while the radius-rod and
valve-stem are connected close to the upper
end thus imparting only a slight motion to
the valve-stem

  as the motion of all valve-gears is quite
a complex study it is extremely difficult to
analyze the walschaert from an elementary
standpoint but reference to the six dia-
grams illustrated in fig  may serve to
convey a fair idea of its motion in this
instance the valve is outside admission and
the motion is represented throughout as in
full forward gear or with the reverse lever
in the extreme forward position

  as has been mentioned the valve receives
its motion from two distinct sources first
from the eccentric-crank which gives the
long travel to the valve and second from
the cross-head bv means of the lap-and-lead
lever which would give a short travel to the
slide-valve even were the eccentric-rod dis-
connected

  starting with diagram one fig  as the
valve i- outside admission with the main pin
on the back center the eccentric-crank is on
the top quarter or a quarter of a revolution
ahead of the pin and the radius-rod is con-
nected to the lap-and-lead lever below the
valve-stem the link is in its central posi-
tion and the valve would he in its central
position on the seat if it were not for the
motion given to it by the lap-and-lead lever

  as it is however the cross-head being at
the back end of the stroke the lower end of
the lap-and-lead lever is at its extreme back

position and the angle assumed by the lever
has moved the valve forward as indicated
by the arrow a distance equal to the lap of
the valve plus the lead the ateam there-
fore enters the back steam-port to the piston
as indicated by the curved arrow while the
other end of the cylinder is open to the ex-
haust

  in diagram two the piston has moved for-
ward a distance equal to about eighty-five
per cent of the stroke the valve has traveled
to its extreme forward position and back
again as indicated by the arrow until it has
closed the back steam-port while the front
port is still open to the exhaust in other
words the valve is at the point of cut-off 

  in diagram three the piston has moved still
nearer to the forward end of the stroke the
exhaust edge of the valve is now in line with
the edge of the back steam-port so that any
further movement will open communication
with this port and the exhaust the front
port on the other hand has been closed to
the exhaust and whatever steam is ahead of
the piston will be compressed

  in diagram four the piston is at the ex-
treme forward end of the stroke the angle
assumed by the lap-and-lead lever has moved
the valve back a distance equal to the lap
plus the lead the front port is open for the
admission of steam and the back port is
open to theexhaust

finest adjustment is possible

  in diagram five the piston is moving toward
the back end of the cylinder and the valve
has just closed the front port to the admis-
sion of steam showing the cut-off position of
the valve on the back stroke

  in diagram six the piston is very nearly at
the end of the back stroke and the valve is
about to open the front port to the exhaust
while the back port is closed to the exhaust
and compression is taking place in the back
end of the cylinder

  in these diagrams which it is believed
will give a clear idea of the changes assumed
in the position of the connecting parts dur-
ing one revolution of the driving-wheels it
is quite apparent that when the reverse lever
is hooked up the link-block will be brought
closer to the center of the link and the mo-
tion imparted to the valve-stem by the radius-
rod reduced proportionately it is thus pos-
sible to work the valve with the equally fine
adjustment of cut-off permissible with the
stephenson link motion

fig -walschaert valve events in one revolution

    this series of diagrams represents the different positions of the valve for different positions
of the crank-pin during one complete revolution of the driving-wheels for the sake of simplicity
the valve and cylinder are shown in section while the other points of the gear are represented
by their center lines and center points only as will be apparent the diagrams are out of pro-
portion the valve and the eccentric throw having been enlarged in order to bring out more
clearly the positions of the edges of the valve relative to the edges of the cylinder ports

the radius-rod is shown in the center of the
link as it would be with the reverse lever in
the center of the quadrant hence the valve-r
stem can receive no motion from the eccen-
tric-crank but it will be noted that it is still
influenced by the lap-and-lead lever or
cross-head connection and the point of con-
nection between the valve-stem and the lap-
and-lead lever is selected to permit the mo-
tion of the former to equal the sum of the
lap of the valve and the lead desired on
either side of the center line

built to stay put	i

  to change the lead of the walschaert
valve-gear it is necessary to change either the
lap of the valve reducing it to increase the
lead and increasing it to reduce the lead in
which case the cut-offs will occur at later or
earlier periods in the stroke respectively r
to change the lengths of the arms or dis-
tances between the connecting points of the
lap-and-lead lever increasing the distance
between the radius-rod connection and the
valve-stem connection to the lap-and-lead

lever would increase the lead while shorten-
ing this distance would decrease it

  the question frequently arises among ma-
chinists and apprentices to whom this gear
is yet unfamiliar whether its parts are as
susceptible to adjustment as the old familiar
stephenson link action in other words
whether the valves can be set should occasion
seem to require it the general impression
among the rank and file is that no adjust-
ment is possible but while this is true in
the abstract it does not imply that no correc-
tion can be made

  on the contrary when intelligently ap-
proached it is possible to do many things
toward straightening out faulty conditions
although it cannot be denied that the real
valve-setter is the man who primarily lays
the motion out on the drawing-board

  in the first place the eccentric - crank
from which the link derives its motion is
supposed to be properly located and keyed
to the crank-pin as a permanency in fact
if the draftsmans work is properly done
there is little liability to inequality in the
movement of the motion

   after a long study combined with practi-
 cal experience in connection with the wals-
 chaert gear the writer recommends the fol-
 lowing compilation of rules which he has
 often applied to advantage in making read-
 justments to this motion in roundhouses after
 the engine had been delivered by the builders
 and presumably in a condition for the best
 results

   these instructions apply to piston-valve
 engines with inside admission with combi-
 nation lever fulcrum located above the valve-
 stem and with the link - block below the
 center of the link when in the forward mo-
 tion this being the general arrangement of
 the motion on passenger engines at least

how adjustments are made

   assuming all parts of the valve-gear to be
 correctly proportioned it is possible to pro-
 ceed as follows

   	with port lines marked on valve-stem
 main-rod valve and all parts of the valve-gear con-
 nected excepting the link end of the eccentric-rod
 adjust the link-block so that there will be no move-
 ment of the valve when the link is oscillated on its
 center in case both valves do not remain station-
 ary with one position of the reverse lever adjust-
 ment must be made on the lifting device of either
 side until they do

    	with reverse lever in its central position as
 found above next connect the link end of the ec-
 centric-rod and find both dead-centers of the en-
 gine and with a tram mark the same on the wheel
 from any rigid point also mark the extreme travel
 points on the guides at the same time checking the
 port lines for -eual lead and square lead by ad-
 justing the valve-stem as per case  following

 run over in order to get the different valve events

place engine in the forward motion and catch the
front and back centers at the same time noting the
positive of the port lines as in case  repeat this
operation with engine in the backward motion
with position of port marks noted there may be
readings similar to either of the four cases follow-
ing after adjustments are made the valves should
be run over in their principal positions valves
may be considered as practically correct when the
cut-off and release events in the forward motion
at the usual running position say twenty-five per
cent cut-off do not vary over one-thirty-second of
an inch though of course closer adjustment is de-
sired if possible

        some temporary repairs

  in connection with the above instructions
it may be added in passing that it is best not
to experiment with the walschaert valve-gear
until thorough familiarity has been attained
with its mechanism properly speaking the
parts are non-adjustable the above being of-
fered merely for the interest it may have in
illustrating what can be done

  having considered the principles of the
motion the next phase of the subject and
that which will naturally be of the greatest
interest to all engineers is what may be done
in case of a break-down although impossi-
ble to lay down rules to cover every case that
might arise some of the more usual failures

can be briefly reviewed and the best and
quickest course indicated to follow in such
cases

   suppose for instance an eccentric-crank
 eccentric-rod or the foot of the link is
 broken or one of the link trunnions twisted
 off the other trunnion holding the link up
 in position

   in such cases take down the eccentric-rod
 disconnect the back end of the radius-rod
 from the lift shaft-arm and secure the link-
 block in the center of the link with the
 motion disconnected and blocked in this way
 the valve on the lame side receives a travel
 from the lap-and-lead lever equal to twice
 the amount of the lap plus the lead which
 gives a port opening equal to the amount of
 the lead

   this permits leaving the main rod up on
 the disabled side and running in with both
 sides as the cylinders can be lubricated
 and although the cut-ofl will be very short
 on the disabled side the steam that is admit-
 ted will do a certain amount of work and
 the engine can be reversed

other break-down remedies

   in accidents where it is necessary to block
 the valve to cover the ports if the engine has
 no relief-valves in the cylinder-heads to re-
 move the best practise is to remove the main
 rod on the disabled side in such instances
 as a broken main rod bent piston-rod or
 cylinder-head knocked out if the valve has
 inside admission and there are no relief-
 valves the engine may be disconnected and
 blocked as follows

   disconnect the front of the radius - rod
 from the lap-and-lead lever and suspend it
 clear of the latter by means of a wire or
 chain from some convenient support secure
 the valve to cover the ports this can usual-
 ly be done by means of a set-screw provided
 in the valve-stem cross-head for this purpose
 but if there is no such set-screw the valve-
 stem cross-head may be blocked take down
 the main rod and block the cross-head at the
 back end of the guides

   with the valve motion disconnected in this
 way the reverse lever is free to operate the
 other side and the engine can be run in on
 one side if the cross-head arm lap-and-
 lead lever connector or lap-and-lead lever
 is broken the engine might be blocked in the
 same way except that of course such of the
 broken parts should be removed as would in
 any way interfere witli the running of the
 engine


the railroad mans magazine

  if the valves have outside admission and
there are no relief-valves in the cylinder-
heads in cases where it is necessary to secure
the valve to cover the ports such as have been
considered it may be effected as follows
disconnect the radius-rod from the lap-and-
lead lever and take down the latter as other-
wise die front end of the radius-rod would
strike the lever as the radius-rod moves back
and forth to the motion of the link

  suspend the front end of the radius-rod
from the valve-stem cross-head guide using
for the purpose a wire or chain the fire-door
chain if no other is at hand secure the
valve to cover the ports and take down the
main rod and block the cross-head at the
back end of the guides

  these are the more common break-downs
with which an engineer may havejp contend
and the above solutions by mr c o rogers
of the american locomotive company to
whose paper the writer is indebted for some

of the material in this article will necessarily
be of assistance after the principle of the
motion has been grasped any failure of the
parts can be handled as readily as those of
the stephenson link motion

  the walschaert valve-gear was first in-
troduced into this country in  being em-
bodied in the first mallet articulated com-
pound ever employed in american railway
practise no  built at the schenectady
works for the baltimore and ohio railroad
and since that time forty per cent of the new
engines turned out have been so equipped

  since it may le applied to any type-of
engine without material change in the design
or multiplication of the moving parts there
seems little doubt in view of the other points
of superiority which have been commented
on that in a short time it will become the
standard locomotive valve motion in this
country as it is now the accepted type on
the railroads of europe

 university gets testing plant

the chicago northwestern turns over to illinois students its equipment

for locomotive testing

pox the recommendation of mr robert
quayle superintendent of motive power
and machinery says the railway and engineering
review  the locomotive testing plant of the chi-
cago and northwestern railway has been presented
to the university of illinois

  under the immediate directions of mr h t
bentley assistanosuperintendent motive power and
machinery it has been taken from its foundation
the bearings and other running parts have been put
in good order for service and the plant with all the
special patterns used in its construction has been
loaded and shipped to the university of illinois

  it is understood that the plant will be held by
the university pending the construction of its pro-
posed transportation laboratory the testing-plant
was designed under the general direction of mr
qua fie aided by mr il m herr

  the drawings were developed under the imme-
diate direction of mr e i thompson now
superintendent motive power and machinery of
the c- st p  and o but who at that time was
chief draftsman for the and x y mr quayle
had been madechairman of the master mechanics
committee on exhaust pipes and steam passages
and some time before while master mechanic at
south kaukauna wisconsin had improvised a
testing-plant by lengthening out the members of a
passenger-car truck to make the wheel spacing
agree with that of the drivers of the locomotive he

desired to test and by mounting this truck bottom
side up in a pit in such a manner that he could
run a locomotive upon it

   encouraged by these earlier experiments he later
advocated the testing of locomotives at the fortieth
street shops of the c and n w the result was
this plant the proceedings of the master car
builders association will show that this plant was
an important factor in the development of several
committee reports dealing with the design of ex-
haust-pipes steam passages draft pipes and stacks
the plant was found useful also in working out
various other problems of more immediate interest
to the railway company

  in recent years it has been idle the plant con-
sists of foundation-plates pedestals and three pairs
of axles with their bearings supporting wheels
friction-brakes etc it was the first of its kind
to be supplied with permanent mounting rails by
use of which a locomotive could be rolled on or
off the wheels without resort to temporary block-
ing

   it is announced by dean goss of the college
of engineering that the plant at the university
will constitute a portion of the equipment of the
school of railway engineering and administra-
tion and that when installed it will be operated

when carmita came

ccording to the old french
 testament which registered
 his birth as having occurred
 on may   eugene
 caillo was eighty-three years
 old at the time of his death

  close on to fifty years he had lived on the
high table-land at the base of mount whitney
hoarding pinching and delving into the
earth for the yellow gold until the super-
stition ignorance and vain imagining of the
miners and cattlemen in the country for miles
around had become accustomed to estimate
his wealth as commensurate with that of
monte cristo and other fabled possessors of
fabled fortunes

  he was a mystery and therefore specula-
tion knew no limit as a matter of fact he
was not a poor man for when the money
was eventually found it counted up into
the thousands numbered by eighty and all
in shining american gold with the signifi-
cant stamp of the united states fair upon
its face

  old caillo was a keen crafty avaricious
fossil bent almost double with toil and the
self-imposed privations of his miserable ex-
istence to him the end of all things was
the accumulation of gold and as goethes
hero gave his soul for his lost youth so did
this aged miner give all that might have
passed for that abstract quantity in his un-
wearying search for the metal that was to
him the alpha and omega of life-the one
thing he worshiped

  his claim covered about two thousand
acres of the fairest and most fertile land
in the mountains and was known as  cail-

los flat crossing it laterally came the
county road from rosalia the crood the
swift-running mountain stream the mexicans
had long ago called el rio santa maria
infiltrated the best portions of it giving him
crops of barley wheat and oats that were
marvels to his few neighbors

  he worked early and late and it hurt him
sorely that twice and sometimes thrice a year
at plowing and harvest and in the spring
rodeos he was obliged to hire a few extra
hands to help him secure the lavish bounty of
nature

  but in all his ground-sluicing he was
never known to work other than entirely
alone

  to the right of the road and facing mount
whitney and the west stood the house-an
old mexican dobe falling to pieces in many
places but withal good for years of shelter
it had deep-set shutterless windows a low
square roof and was shaded from the hot sun
of southern california by massive fig-trees

  three years before old caillo died car-
mita came

  the mines called hardtack rex
monte and  comet  were in full blast
then and paying well the nearest town to
camp was tres pinos and that was seven-
teen miles away  caillos flat was but
six a clear saving of eleven hard miles

  with crafty coyote-like sagacity old
caillo reflected on the situation and decided
he would become a store-keeper there was
plenty of room in the old house so he fitted
the north end of the dobe with a rude coun-
ter and shelves and notified the camps that
he was prepared to furnish them with any
necessity or luxury they required at a cost
that would merely cover the expense of
transportation into the hills

  then he sent for carmita




the railroad mans magazine

  carmita was the child of his dead sister
and her spanish husband also dead by
name ramon arcana when she came to
 caillos flat  she had just commenced her
eighteenth summer and on her clear-cut
oval olive-tinted face shone all the glorious
sad serenity of the southern sunset her
eyes were luminous starlit and reflective
and when one looked into their liquid depths
and saw the wealth of passionate tenderness
and true womanhood living there he be-
lieved in a soul

  the new life seemed strange to her and
revoltinely hard and cruel-and most cruel

        o j

of all things she saw was her uncle eugene
caillo

  born a peasant with all the shift and pri-
vation that entails shehad been the child of
her father and by him passionately loved
and tenderly cared for now that he was
dead there was no one of her blood but her
uncle and fate had given her to him

  there was a hunger in her heart ever for
the one word of love that never came for
which all the strength and loveliness of nature
surrounding her failed to compensate

  the coarseness of the miners and cattle-
men who came to the store at whose counter
she now presided wounded her gentle nature
as sharp thorns and her whole being shrank
and turned from the publicly expressed words
and looks of admiration they sought to give
her

  love to her was so sacred so holy a thing
she could not fancy its pure white presence
in the fumes of vile tobacco and still viler
whisky but she lived her life with courage
and true womanly dignity giving the sorrow
and the unutterable longing in her heart no
words and doing her duty so faithfully so
patiently and uncomplainingly that had it
been possible for old caillo to have cared
for anything it would have been the beautiful
carmita

chapter ii

the master of the rancho

hphe master of rancho buena vista
philip garrick had been in the foot-
hills since the last october which was before
carmita came and the comfortable log-house
on badgers flat which he called home was
peopled only by his three vaqueros

  a mystery was philip garrick-a mystery
rivaling in interest the fabulous possessions
of old caillo much and varied had been
the talk and speculation regarding him but

prophets and gossips of the range were for
once utterly baffled and obliged to content
themselves with their own not over-satisfac-
tory conclusions

  he never spoke of himself or referred to
the past in any way

  they only knew that six years back they
had seen him for the first time when he
quietly took possession of noriegas stock
and ranch that he had paid cash for it with
a check on the bank at rosalia which had
been duly honored without question that he
had altered repaired and fitted up the place
until his without dissent was the best ranch
in themountains

  his face was fair with a light in his blue
eyes that commanded their respect despite its
youth and the careless good nature of his
smile his figure was slight erect and ath-
letic and he rode well and was singularly
adept with a riata for a tenderfoot

  there was a certain inexplicable some-
thing about his carriage his manner and the
tone of his voice they had never known be-
fore and last and what was perhaps
greater than all else with them he seemed
in no way bothered by an insufficiency of
money

  gradually and unpresumingly he took his
place among them taking his share of the
joys and sorrows of the small community
with cheerful graciousness and manliness

  this continued until the morning he rode
back to his home in the spring after carmita
came when he was by all odds the most
popular man in the mountains-popular
with all save one man and that was james
gonnley superintendent of the comet mine

   you will observe well the senor who was
just here carmita cackled old caillo in
his mystifying patois of mingled french
spanish and mexican  he is a gringo
oh yes but then different my girl far differ-
ent from any you will see and quite my best
customer yes better even than el senor
gormley

   we know nothing of him actually noth-
ing a closer mouth than his is not to be
found among my own or your mothers
nation but he pays well girl-pays and al-
ways in fair yellow gold that is so beautiful
to see and you are fair to see carmita
fair to the eyes of youth and you understand
me i would have you smile your sweetest on
the senor philip for when a girl smiles the
gold of young fools comes- easily and there
is no better place for the senor philips gold
to come than to me who understand how to
treasure it and to keep it at its worth
in the hornets nest



  carmita drew back her look pictured her
disdain

  ha ha this young senor is rich do you
hear me the old man continued rich
two thousand fine cattle and the finest
rancho in the mountains but dont lose
your heart he is not for you you have your
dear old uncle and he loves you too well
far too well to lose you

  the thin parched lips of the miser parted
showing the black snags of teeth in the skele-
ton jaw while a grin of restrained satisfac-
tion spread over his mummified face

  she had seen him only a few times but
since his first coming to the store life had
grown fairer almost dearer to her

  when the coarse and brutal admonition of
her uncle reached her the blood rushed vio-
lently to her olive cheeks and she felt as if
he had given her a blow yet withal with a
strange sense of guilt on her as if deserving
it

  she could not have even told the little
crucifix above her bed but the subtle melody
of philips tones soft and caressing as the
sigh of the south wind had reached her and
touched her and filled her with a happiness
that was akin to pain

  her southern nature doubly strong from
the control she had of it had gone out to
meet this new voice this fair face this
gracious courtesy of a true nobility as a lark
springs out and upward to meet the morning
sunshine

  his presence had come to her as the summer
rain comes to a thirsty rose and even before
she had learned to speak the hard consonants
of his name softly and reverently to the beat-
ing of her heart she knew and felt herself a
guilty thing inasmuch as her womanhood
shrank from what each stifled throb of her
bosom told her to be the truth

chapter iii

gormley speaks his mind

vithen the sun arose then arose carmita
and the manifold duties of the day
began the old house from its former state
of neglect and dirt now shone with neatness
and order

  her hands which toil seemed powerless to
harden or defile were never idle this was
a luxury her hitherto weary heart could not
allowilf even had her circumstances per-
mitted its indulgence with the simple morn-
ing meal finished there was the house to be
tidied up and the poultry and calves to be

looked after until the shadow of the sun
on the kitchen floor told her it was time to
take her place in the store in chance of pos-
sible early patrons

  then she would seat herself at the door-
the white crests of the mountains and the long
white road stretching away to rosalia be-
fore her while the linhets and thrushes sang
their love-songs and builded their homes in
the fig-trees above her head

  busily stitching on some garment of old
caillos she would lose herself in the one
solace her life knew-her dream of philip
for the white road that wound its way so
sinuously through the barley and wheat of
the fat lands of  caillos flat also took the
direction of the rancho buena vista just to
think of him was a pleasure

  there was one face she dreaded-dreaded
even more than the crafty cadaverous face
of her uncle when it was convulsed and dis-
torted with avaricious disappointment and
anger from a valueless day in the ground
sluices

  it was the face of gormley the superin-
tendent of the comet mine

  since her coming his had been the eyes
and his the voice of any stranger to greet her
the oftenest a false dark sensuous face
fringed with a thick black beard a large
mouth and aquiline nose black beady eyes
gleaming restless with the fascination of the
rattlesnake and a smile which if given to a
man following a lonely trail on a dark night
would cause him to feel for his six-shooter
and keep mr gormley at a respectable dis-
tance in front of him

  gormley had told her several times that he
loved her

  he had told her this ere she had been on the
mountain two months and all of her gentle
nature arose in rebellion and disgust at his
presence and his coarse words

  the vaqueros and the men at the various
mines had noticed his attentions and they
knowing him and understanding the situa-
tion and the utter impossibility for him to
be honest in any way except in an attempt to
deceive some one said publicly that  jim
gormley never missed an opportunity in try-
ing to feather his own nest and that old
eugene caillos yellow  shiners  were a
mighty attraction

  with no greater barrier to their possession
in his way than the frail life of the miser
and the white throat of the girl it behooved
him to spend his smiles lavishly to go often
and to stay long to pass unheeded the ill-
concealed repulsion and fear of the girl at

his advances and to keep the way clear of
all possible rivals

chapter iv
carmita tells philip

ou will hear me carmita you will
not turn from me and think my
words untrue listen my beloved i take
those stars above us as witness to my truth
could i help loving you could anything that
knows the breath of life see you and not love
you

  you have seen my love you must have
seen it day after day have i come here
only to hear you speak only to feel in my
heart the glory of your smile

   life could not be life again without your
presence in my soul there would be no sun-
shine no light to warm my eyes in the morn-
ing and the nights would be worse than
death-for in death i might know you
carmita

  the river of wan- splashed and crooned
and sung over its pebbly bed the far-off
sound of sheep-bells came melodiously across
the distance and a crescent moon hung sus-
pended as a sickle of silvery fire above the
white brows of the sierras

  in the old  dobe lost in dreams of his
yellow god lay old eugene-and here in the
soft light of the crescent moon with the
waters at their feet and love in their eyes
stood philip and carmita

  the moonbeams touched to silver her raven
hair her bosom heaved and her breath came
quick but in her dark passionate eyes there
was no question no attempt at concealment

  she placed both hands on his shoulders
and looking up at him with the trust of a
loving woman said in her sonorous liquid
castilian

  oh my philip you have too much
mercy for carmita you ask me do i love
you beloved look into my eyes and read
the answer there

chapter v
the missing miser

 cenor your words are useless they
are worse-they are cruel they are
a wrong to me and a wrong to him who is
more than myself

  her big eyes flashed and she drew herself
up and walked away with the majesty of a
goddess

  gormley bit his lip and struck his boots
two or three times sharply with his quirt-
then the old cynical hypocritical smile came
back to his face and following her with
mock humility he slowly said

  him senorita excuse me if i fail to
understand you you have not as yet done
me the honor to mention who  him  is

  carmita turned slowly her eyes stillflash-
ing

   it is unnecessary senor were you a
gentleman you would not ask she said
quietly with a slight dignified inclination
of her head she entered the house

  gormley stood for a moment irresolute
whether or not to follow her further but the
look of her face daunted him with a
smothered curse he walked to his horse-and
mounting raked his spurs in the animals
flanks until it dashed furiously down the
road snorting with pain

   so ho my senor garrick you have
stolen the march on me after all  he mut-
tered between his teeth  and the fair mexi-
can flower will not only give you her sweet-
ness but will empty all the old misers treas-
ure into your already well-lined belt

   she will if jim gormley cant help him-
self well well see you accursed dog well
see its a frosty day in california when i
get left

  the whole year was one glad summer-time
to carmita it mattered not that the flowers
withered and died that the birds all went
away to the valley southward that the hills
grew sere and brown that the white mantles
of the mountains seemed to be getting closer
and closer with each day no it mattered
not for ever her heart sang and the light
that lay in her eyes was a fairer light than
that of summer moons for it was the light of
perfect trust and absolute love

  eugene caillo had fought and continued
to fight against the new-born happiness his
avarice had grown to extend to her for she
was a medium that produced much gold

  but carmita was a woman now and love
made her strong patiently and cheerfully
she bore with his complaining and upbraid-
ing but there was a look on her face that
told him not to venture too far

  then there was philip now and the cun-
ning old man was crafty enough not to over-
step the limit of his nieces endurance as his
reason told him that such an act would only
produce a climax the result of which would
be the loss to him forever of his most profit-
able chattel were it not for this he would
have struck her
in the hornets nest



  had she been beautiful before she was
regal now no passion-flower was more lus-
trous than her face no mountain deer on the
hillside more full of grace than she

  more than one strong honest heart beat-
ing in the broad breast of some cattleman or
miner sighed for her as her soft fingers
carelessly touched theirs when handing them
a purchase at the store-but her eyes with
their radiant smile were always out and away
in the line of rancho buena vista only
one step and the sound of one voice could
recall their gaze

  gormley after using all his deceits and
wiles to provoke old caillo to open revolt
had at last given up and was seldom seen at
the store

  love had come to the old dobe and love
is greater than all

  the full moon of the last of december was
hanging low on the snowy crest of mount
whitney a strange weird light fell on the
spectral peaks about him and silvered the
open lands of caillos flat the old dobe
stood out in black and bold relief against the
foreground of dazzling ghastly whiteness
the shrill mournful savage cry of a moun-
tain-lion came from the fastnesses of the
mountains the clock of the old kitchen
struck eight and the sound of a horses hoofs
ridden at a gallop fell sharp and distinct on
the hard road

  as the sound of the horses feet came
nearer carmita rose hurriedly from her seat
by the hearth and passing with a quick
step to the door flung it wide open to her
lover who was dismounting by one of the
fig-trees

  her face was white and weary there
was a frightened look in her deep luminous
eyes that was new to them

    oh my philip  she said as philip drew
her passionately to his arms  it is good
you have come for i have been sore afraid
and troubled see i am alone

  they entered the house and she continued
my uncle has not returned

  philip looked questioningly into her eyes
and then scanned the darkness of the old
kitchen lighted by the meager flame of one
candle and the scant blaze on the hearth

  not returned carmita do you mean
that he has not been home since morning 

  not since five oclock this morning
philip he was working at the ground-
sluicing on bear flat as you know and no-
body ever works with him at the ground-
sluicing

  the evening meal was set at six and i

was so happy thinking of to-morrow that i
scarcely heeded the darkness and he not yet
home suddenly the clock struck seven and
then a wild fear came to me and i reproached
myself with the ingratitude of my happiness
when that frail tottering old man might have
met some terrible calamity

   ah it has been a long hour my philip
waiting your coming but now that you are
here i am strong again for you will find my
poor old uncle and bring him to his home
do this for me 

  carmita were you to wish it he should
have my life you know that but the man
who has been cruel to you and so wronged
me can never have my respect or my esteem

    the old fellow has probably worked late
and darkness catching him has stopped at
one of the camps but lies an unfeeling
wretch to leave you here alone to worry about
him

   however set your fears at rest my be-
loved old eugene is too knowing to lose
himself in these hills

   but for your sake and if you tell me to
go and leave you here alone ill ride quickly
over to the camps and find him

  yes go philip ive no fear to be
alone it will comfort my heart that my
philip and so brave and strong an arm as
his are so merciful and forgiving

  the hours seemed long to her but she
waited with the patience and courage of a
woman who loved-waited alone in the old
house on the mountain

  she watched and listened and waited into
the cold light of the dawn and prayed for the
safety of the one man who had never given
her a kind word

  the west wind lulled in its moaning the
savage call of the mountain-lion was still
there was a convulsive heaving of the opaque
shadows in the east

  the morning dawned and carmita was
still alone

chapter vi
the finding in the sluices

 t length philip garrick returned his
good horse apache was worn and
jaded there was a strange baffled look
on the riders face-for he was alone

  i have been everywhere carmita he
said wearily  and no one has seen your
uncle

  carmitas tears were her strongest plead-
ing that philip should renew his quest


the railroad maxs magazine

  he saddled a fresh horse and went forth
once more in search of the man who had
ever been his enemy he was weary embit-
tered and anxious not for the fate of old
caillo but for the girl whose face was so
white and whose eyes spoke to him so wist-
fully so pleadingly for his saving aid

  he took the trail directly to bear flat
and following the course of the stream he
reached the open country

  everywhere were die traces of the old
misers toil the land was fissured and
broken in all directions by deep gulches all
issuing transversely from the stream he
staked his horse with his riata and com-
menced his search

  the sun told him it was two hours of mid-
day when at the head of one of the sluices
he came to the place where eugene caillo
had eaten his frugal noonday meal not twenty
hours before

   this was the first clue

  quickly he examined the sides of the
sluice leaping into it he walked slowly in
the direction of the outlet

  the sluice was perhaps eight or ten feet
deep with a width at the top of two-thirds
that number and narrowing gradually as it
reached the bottom giving it the shape of a
wedge

  the soil was of a loose gravelly formation
with no piece of rock visible larger than an
egg philip particularly noticed these char-
acteristics nor at any future time was any
stone discovered in the gulch which of its
own size and weight was sufficient to cause
a mans death unpropelled by other forces
than its own gravity

  he had followed the cut for three hundred
yards from its source when he suddenly
halted as one turned to stone

  the cold shudder that passed through his
blood and the sight that met his startled eyes
told him his search was ended

  there at the bottom of the sluice face
down hi body partially covered by gravel
and dirt lay old eugene caillo the point
of his pick protruded from above his shoul-
ders as if while using it he had fallen on
it by his side lay a heavy iron bar

  controlling himself and conquering his
aversion philip quickly removed the debris
from the prostrate form and lifting the poor
attenuated body in his arms bore it carefully
to the bank above

  his first thought was for carmita what
she would say how to tell her

  true she had never loved the miserable
apology of humanity which now lay before

him with the vision of the yellow gold fied
forever from the crafty eyes but with her-
true child of the south bred to a sense of
obedience and self-denial which makes duty
to ones kin almost take the place of love-
he knew that the tragic ending of the cruel
old miser would be deeply deplored

  thoughts like these flitted through
philips mind as he stretched the withered
form in the shade of a giant cottonwood
covering the face with his own jacket he
mounted his horse and rode rapidly down the
trail

  there was nothing to do but to break the
news as tenderly as he could to carmita and
then harness some mules and bring back to
the dobe all that remained of the miser

   it is even as i thought philip said
carmita quietly as she slowly brushed the
big tears from her eyes  it is even as i
thought and may heaven have mercy on his
weakness and forgive his sins

  excitement ran high on die mountain
when the news got abroad that old eugene
had been found dead in the ground-sluices
by philip garrick miners prospectors
vaqueros and cattlemen for miles around
flocked to the dobe and to bear flat the
scene of the tragedy

  various and conflicting were the opinions
and theories entertained as to how old caillo
met his death he had been laid in his grave
a fortnight before theory and opinion took
the form of direct suspicion and denuncia-
tion

  then the storm brewed by villainy and
fostered by ignorance greed and supersti-
tion burst spending the full fury of its wrath
on the unsuspecting heads of carmita and
philip garrick

chapter vii
the breath of suspicion

chow me an ignorant man and i will
 show you a coward show me a brutal
man and i vill show you a villain gormley
was all of these

  poisonous as a rattlesnake vindictive and
subtle as a blackmailer smarting under the
great disappointment to secure through car-
mita the gold of eugene caillo and stung
to madness by the girls calm contempt for
hjm gormley had remained as quiescent as
an anaconda waiting for its prey

  but now behold-fate or his own hand
had brought the prey within reach of his
fangs
in the hornets nest



  very insidiously very cautiously had he
set his poisonous tale afloat giving such
bold and compact reasons and using the
casuistry fate had placed in his hands with
such discriminative skill that almost before
he realized it the whole mountain and neigh-
boring towns were aflame with the most
ignorant suspicions against carmita and
philip

  not that we can ever bring them to jus-
tice-oh no he said  the have man-
aged the job too cleverly for that but it is
only fair to yourselves not to care to mix with
murderers even though one be a mighty fine-
looking girl and the other the owner of the
best ranch in the hills

  it doesnt take a wise man to see that
they are the only ones who could be benefited
by that old misers death and depend upon
it it was philip garricks arm that sent
old eugene to his last account-although of
course we may never prove it

  all this he would say to bind his denun-
ciatory remarks of carmita and philip as he
rode through die country burning the torch
of a dastard vcngeance

  to carmita the shock caused by these
suspicions came as a blast of wintry winds
to a rose-garden

  when philip told her she had no word to
give him in reply a face whiter than his
own turned mutely to him with a wild ques-
tioning appeal in her frightened eyes for the
explanation he could not give

  a will attested and signed bearing recent
date had been found in the iron-bound oaken
box where the old miser kept his papers

  it bequeathed all he possessed without
reservation to the daughter of my dead
sister madelon carmita arcana

  with the will was a paper containing de-
scriptions and iude diagrams accurately
locating the place of concealment of old
caillos treasure

  philip read to the end the contents of both
documents and without a word of comment
placed them in carmitas hand

  a tremor passed over her when she touched
the parchment bursting into tears she flung
her arms round her lovers neck and sobbed
convulsively then she was strong again
quietly drying her eyes she returned the pa-
pers to philip

  nay my philip give not to me these
writings the unholy worth of which has
already sought to make carmita accursed
hide them once more from all mens eyes
in the black secrecy of my uncles strong-box
and there let them lie uncared for and un-

   	rr

heeded until the morning sun brings back
that day when you and i are free from taint
to all the world

chapter viii
the parting

 nd now once more spring had come
back and the first fair flowers of the
year were blooming on old eugene caillos
grave apache ready saddled stood under
the fig-trees before the dobe waiting to bear
his master away

  a few months before gormley had sudden-
ly left bear flat

   oh carmita think ere it is too late
is there no other choice left me than this
let the law make you mine in name as love
has made you mine in soul then will my
going have no terror for me

  into the grand serious eyes of the girl
came a light of quiet heroism that made
them luminous as tropic stars with the
movement of the rich undulating grace
habitual to her she approached philip
wreathed his neck with her arms and press-
ing her lips to his looked into his face and-
said with the calmness of absolute passion
 my beloved oh my philip if i could
only die for you help me to try to live
there will lie no light for carmitas eyes no
gladness for her heart day and night she
can only work and wait and pray

  philip this is love carmitas heart-
ache carmitas life is nothing but you
my beloved you are all through all your
ways in waking and in sleeping-there will
my heart be thou wilt think of me here by
the mountains in body but thy soul will tell
you carmita has no life but where you are
i am strong enough to smile upon your going
i am strong enough to put away the heaven
of your amis for the honor of my love for
you-for the honor of your name

  when the sun set and the first stars were
smiling on the rich valley-lands of rosalia
philip garrick rode wearily through the little
town with no response in his heart to the
soft languorous passion of the guitars that
fell so dulcet on the air

  there was music and dancing in rosalia
lights were gleaming from every rose-bow-
erecl piazza and every house merry voices
shouting laughing and singing in the sen-
suous mexican patois reached his ears as
apache cantered slowly through the streets
redolent with the breath of orange-blossoms
and countless roses


the railroad mans magazine

  there was music and dancing in rosalia-
but under the shadow of -mount whitney in
the lonely kitchen of the old dobe a girl with
a white set face and a brave light in her
eyes knelt before the cross that was her
mothers and whispered one name

  philip-

  anger tierce in its righteousness ven-
geance relentless in its pitilessness as a cor-
sicans tilled garricks veins when the first
breath of their evil suspicion had reached
him touching carmita

  for himself he cared nothing what they
thought or said his strength to defend him-
self lay in the muscles of his right arm and
there was no man on the mountain who failed
to hold them at their worth

  but carmita it was as well to hold the
snow-flower corrupt or the fawn on the
mountainside a conspirator

  resolutely methodically untiringly he
went over every incident connected with the
last days of old caillo with truer fidelity
than a trained detective he spent his money
lavishly and in the right places and was
not long in tracing to gormlev the origin of
all

  first there was the miners protestation
of love and his repulse with ill-concealed
loathing by carmita his threat of vengeance
and his mysterious and ominous silence

  then since the superintendent had so sud-
denly left the mountain philip had proved
by two reliable witnesses that gormley had
ridden to bear flat on the day preceding the
murder in the endeavor to secure a loan to
pay off his men he had failed but it was
apparent to philip that he must have been
the last man to see the old miser alive

  finally while searching the ground-sluice
at the place of the old mans death philip
had found the torn frasjment of an overall
bearing the stain of blood and matted hair

  closely examining the iron bar he had little
difficulty in tracing the blood-stain which
had been hastily wiped from it by the piece
of overall and as proof corroborative par-
tially buried in the sand he drew forth to
his eager eyes a small magnifying glass such
as are used by prospectors stamped with the
initials j c gj

  next to his love for carmita was the fierce
happiness of his coming vengeance

  carmita he said almost exultingly
the world is too narrow to hold the life of
that murderer and my life and when i reach
him beloved then will philip garrick give
back to him such mercy as he gave to me
and mine

  after a months time he wrote thus

    as yet ihere is nothing with me but your
  love and hope

   still later

    it may be there are now twice a thousand
  miles between you and me carmita but i had
  traced the villain to this far north-land only
  to reach here and find he had doubled and is
  now traveling southward but justice and your
  love go with me and i shall find him in the
  end

  all through the golden summer-time came
the letters alternating with success and dis-
appointment but never losing hope

  at length at the close of a bright crisp
day early in december a stranger cahie to the
old dobe riding straight from rosalia
and handed to the patient carmita a yellow
envelope which held a telegram from the city
of carnullo-from philip garrick to carmita
arcana

  it bore these words i have found
gormley

  carnullo was to the southwest what the
fair citv of paris is to france-its metrop-
olis the smallpox was raging there each
night the people lifted their eyes to the brazen
cruel skies and prayed for rain and the
breath of the salt wind from the sea to banish
the pestilence but neither the wind nor the
rain heeded and despair succeeded terror

  at the beginning of a-hot sultry night
when the skies seemed one mass of seething
molten brass philip garrick knocked at the
outer gate of the citys pest-house

  you have within a patient named gorm-
ley i wish to see him he said to the attend-
ant who answered his summons

   i am sorry sir but it is impossible re-
plied the attendant

  nothing is impossible to an earnest man
my friend said philip quietly interrupting
him  here is gold admit me to gorm-
ley

  the man trembled violently and began
to waver  before him was more than a years
pay surely it were worth braving detection

   if you were some very near relative sir
he stammered  i might from my pity for
you risk losing my place for the patient you
speak of is very bad and without wishingto
hurt your feelings sir may not recover

  a smile of double meaning flitted across
philips white face as he placed the purse in
the mans ready palm

  content yourself he said i am his
brother

  around him was death in its most hideous
                            i

in the hornets nest	

loathsome form the air he breathed was
death too horrible even for thought but the
shadow of the smile still rested on his white
face and the steely gleam played in his blue
eyes he was not thinking of death he was
not tliinking of anything

  he was beginning to feel his vengeance

  the room was absolutely bare-absolutely
merciless through the open windows came
the brazen glare of the sky and the noise of
the  helpers  moving coffins on a rude
bed in one corner naked and covered only
with a sheet tossing and writhing in the
agonies of death lay gormley

  philip almost trembled he was afraid he
had come too late

  the attendant entered with pen and ink
which he placed on a small table and then
retired

  crossing to the bed he touched the dying
man before him saying

   gormley gormley call back your
senses once more and look yes- i am
philip garrick

  again the smile flitted across the white
face and the gleam of steel shone in the blue
eyes

  the effect of the words and the tone of
his voice on the writhing wretch on the bed
were as a powerful electric shock

  the bulging distended eyes stared blankly
into his the swollen distorted mouth made
a wild effort to speak-at last finding words
in

  fiend have you come to taunt me with
the murder of eugene caillo

  philip trembled bitter cruel merciless
words were on his lips but ere his tongue
gave them utterance he seemed to see there
before him in the midst of the pestilence
the pure face of carmita

  following the desperate helplessness of
gormleys question he seemed to hear her
last brave words to him  thou wilt be
merciful my philip even as we all need
mercy love was stronger than vengeance

to be c

 bending once more over the dying man he
 poured into his throat a potion which had its
 effect at once

     gormley listen he said in a softer tone
  and with the smile gone from his face and the
  gleam from his eyes

    i came here to gloat over your death i
 remain to help you save your soul death is
 almost with you  power on earth can stay
 its coming it is needless for me to tell you
 that i have proof absolute of who killed
 eugene caillo therefore death is your kind-
 est friend

    you know the wrong you have done the
 innocent you told carmita you loved her
 let your last act be to help secure your eternal
 pardon repair your wrong to carmita see
 here are pen and ink and here is a paper
 known to  eyes but mine you know me
 and you know i do not lie this paper is a
 simple confession made by the man who
 killed old caillo i want you to sign it

    his staring eyes were getting dimmer his
 breath came with a sickening gurgle but the
 spark of divinity latent in all humanity
 brightened him and he took the pen in his
 black and swollen fingers scrawling the
 name james c gormley and without a
 word fell back on the pillow dead

   philip had found his vengeance and its
 taste was as dead sea fruit

   you have earned your reward he said
 to the attendant  but he is dead here is
 more money-let him be buried with the re-
 spect due a man

   he went to an obscure lodging bathed
 and changed his clothing thoroughly fumi-
 gating in sulfur fumes the parchment that
 held the precious confession this he placed
 in an air-tight cylinder and concealed it on
 his person

    late that night the wire flashed to rosalia
  and with the dawn of day a special mes-
  senger bore over the mountains to the old
  dobe these words i am coming home

early railroad days in
new england

by charles frederick carte r

besides enjoying the proud distinction of having operated the first railroad
in america it is also the boast of new englanders that no other part of the
country is able to show the same degree of development in early railroad
construction the land of the pilgrim fathers may well be termed the birthplace
of american railroads for with a few exceptions most of the first attempts at
operating wheeled vehicles on a track were fostered there

    it is true that the cautious yankees were a little slow to put their money into
such a jiew aiid venturesome project but they soon discovered that the railroad
had come to stay and was destined to be a sure dividend-earner

    some of the practises of these early railroaders will bring smiles to the present-
day railroad men to whom such stunts as a brakeman setting out on foot to locate
a missing train or a station-agent having to keep the right-of-way clear of snow in
winter are scarcely in the realm of probability

when every train had two conductors and agents after selling their
tickets went out and collected them from the passengers
and locomotives could haul five cars

 onsidering the yankees rep-
utation for ingenuity it is not
to be wondered at that new
england is credited with the
first railroad ever built and
operated on this side of the
atlantic the formal opening of this pio-
neer line the so-called quincy granite rail-
road was an event of some importance
which drew a considerable crowd of specta-
tors

  some were there who had been to eng-
land where they had seen some of the col-
liery tramways then in use these learned
travelers pleased gridlev bryant the builder
of the line by telling him his railroad was
quite as good as any in england it makes
this event seem very recent to learn that the
man who drove the first team or rather the
first horse on this first american railroad
was still living at chelsea massachusetts as
late as august 

  lewis cheney this original railroad man
in spite of his eighty-five years had a very
clear recollection of that historic opening-day
in  and he loved to tell how the crowd
gaped when he cracked his whip and
started the horse which drew the first load of
sixteen tons of granite for the bunker hill
monument on three wagons weighing five
tons

  the road was slightly down-hill all the
way from the quarry to the river which
helped the horse without detracting anything
from the amazement of the crowd

  some of the more impressionable specta-
tors who saw the horse driven by young
cheney walking off with a load of twenty-
one tons thought that in time railroads
might amount to something but it would
hardly have been in keeping with the yan-
kee reputation for shrewdness if such radical
views had been accepted implicitly on such
slender evidence new england in fact ac-
early railroad days in new england



cepted the railroad with strong mental reser-
vations

  when the innovation got into the happy
hunting-ground of the legislature which it
soon didit excited the most intense alarm
lawmakers had not then learned what a
blessing a railroad bill of any kind can be
to die politician who knows how to manipu-
late it skilfully

  this first unwelcome intrusion of the rail-
road in the state house was in the form of
a resolution to the effect that a railroad
from boston to the qonnecticut river would
be of public advantage upon this innocent
assertion the conservatives jumped with
shameless disregard of the marquis of
queensberry rules

  pass this resolution shouted one of
them his face red and moist with excite-
ment  and who can predict the conse-
quences if we should say by our acts that
such a work would be of advantage who can
say that some daring agitator may not arise
and put the idea into practise if such a
work should be undertaken the public credit
would be overthrown and every dollar of
property in the commonwealth would be in
jeopardy

the first surveys

  after fierce opposition the resolution was
adopted by a majority of one vote the
forebodings of the minority which came so
near being the majority proved to be only
too well founded for after a great deal of
discussion in the newspapers and in pam-
phlets a daring agitator did induce the mas-
sachusetts legislature to authorize the ap-
pointment of a board of commissioners to
cause surveys to be made for a railroad route
from boston to the hudson river at or near
albany

  a large part of the route was surveyed that
same year to the infinite delight of the in-
habitants not only on that survey but for
several years afterward the country folk
would turn out in a body and follow the sur-
veying parties all day long manifesting the
liveliest interest in every move

  the engineers like all their kind in those
early days were self-taught their equip-
ment was very scanty usually consisting of
a pocket compass and perhaps a level
and one of those heavy old iron chains which
were better suited for logging than for sur-
veying

  the axmen with the parties young farm-
ers hired for the occasion lost no opportunity

to air their knowledge of engineering one
of the early engineers relates that one day he
overheard an axman explaining to a group
of inquisitive yankees that the engineers
found the distance across a river by measur-
ing along its sbank

   but haow kin he figger it aout that
way 

  by logarithms ye darned fool

how a railroad was run

  the next legislature authorized the ap-
pointment of a board of directors of internal
improvements consisting of twelve members
and appropriated money to finish the surveys
and provide for plans for a railroad the
survey to the hudson was completed and
three lines were run from boston to provi-
dence in a report to the board of directors
published in  daniel treadwell and his
associates recommended that both roads
should be built by the state in trying to
make the directors understand how a railroad
was run treadwell said

  let us take an example of a railway
which we will suppose to be one hundred
miles long and on which coaches to travel
nine miles and freight-wagons to go three
miles an hour enter upon their journeys at
both ends of the railway at intervals of
twelve hours only the wagons in one di-
rection must meet those of an opposite di-
rection at distances of sixteen and two-thirds
miles from either end of the railway after
allowing twenty-six minutes for rest feeding
and changing horses at each interval

   the coaches would meet the opposite
coaches midway and they would meet trains
of wagons at the distance of twenty-five and
seventy-five miles from either end of the
railway  there would then be eight points
of meeting on the hundred miles at each of
which a siding or passing-place must be
provided and it must be evident that if the
carriages arrive within the prescribed time
the passing would be effected without the
least difficulty should a train of carriages
arrive at a passing - place before the pre-
scribed time it would only be necessary that
they should wait for the opposite train to ar-
rive when they would enter on the next
stage of their journey

  notwithstanding this lucid explanation of
the modus operandi the legislature refused
to invest any public funds in such a revolu-
tionary venture however there was no ob-
jection to authorizing private individuals to
fritter away their money that way so several
the railroad mans magazine

charters were granted they came to noth-
ing for no one would risk a dollar on
railroad building the yankees were too
shrewd for that

money-back stocks and bonds

  the railroad cranks were so persistent
that they returned to the fray at the summer
session of  the charter of the boston
and lowell granted in  was amended
to make it more attractive to possible in-
vestors and the boston and providence and
the boston and worcester railroads were
chartered

  the capitalists of that early day peremp-
torily refused to have anything to do with so
crazy a scheme as a railroad but by this
time a few credulous business men of modest
means could be found who ventured to put
down their names for small amounts of stock
in popular parlance though there was a
string to the subscriptions for the subscri-
bers reserved the right to back out if they did
not like the outlook after receiving the re-
ports and estimates of the engineers

  surveys were vigorously carried on during
the season of  next year the organiza-
tion of the boston and worcester was com-
pleted the subscriptions were made final
and in the autumn of  contracts for con-
struction were let in the summer of 
track-laying was begun the first nine
miles from boston to west newton were
opened april   by july  the track
was extended to needham thirteen miles
farther and by november  of the same
year to westboro a distance of thirty-two
miles

  soon after the line was opened to need-
ham the first locomotive built in new eng-
land was delivered to the boston and wor-
cester

  this locomotive said the boston ad-
vertiser  was built by mr boulton at the
mill dam foundry in this city for the bos-
ton and worcester railroad the yankee
is modeled after an english engine imported
for the lowell road and takes regularly a
load of forty tons in forty-seven to fifty
minutes it has made one mile in two min-
utes three seconds

  the first train ran into worcester forty-
four and five-eighths miles from boston july
  and three days later a train-load of
bostonians made the run to worcester in
the remarkably fast time of three hours to
take part in a celebration of the completion
of the road

  the construction of this line used up all
the money that could be raised in poston for
railroad construction the capital for the
boston and providence was obtained in new
york while that for the boston and lowell
was provided by manufacturers in the latter
city both roads were completed in june
 just a few days before the boston and
worcester

  with the exception of the norwich and
worcester also completed in  no further
railroad building was attempted in massa-
chusetts for some time the canny bay-
state folk concluded to wait and see how the
railroads turned out before risking any more
time and money on them they were not to
be carried off their feet by any spectacular
performances either

two anti-railroad towns

  as late as  when the old colony
road was first proposed the opposition to it
was strenuous particularly in quincy and
dorchester a meeting was held at quincy
to fight the railroad at which it was pointed
out that a railroad to boston would affect
the price of oats and so injure the farming
interests of the town besides breaking up
mr gillettes business

  mr gillette was the proprietor of a stage-
coach which daily took six passengers to and
from the city dorchester sent a committee
to the legislature to oppose the charter with
every means at its command and thus prevent
 so great a calamity to our town as must be
the location of any railroad through it

  if it couldnt do that the committee was
instructed to try at least to have the road pass
through the outskirts of the town the ef-
forts of the committee failed utterly mr
gillettes business was ruined just as had
been predicted and the landholders of both
towns found their property soaring in value
from  an acre to  an acre in spite
of all they could do

record-breaking locomotives

  meanwhile the railroads were fighting
their way in the face of strong opposition
those first massachusetts roads had only
been in existence three years when they were
visited early in  by j knight and b
h latrobe the baltimore and ohio engi-
neers who were making a tour of all the
american roads then in existence in search
of pointers to be applied in the conduct of
their own road
early railroad days in new england



  for their benefit the boston and lowell
folk trotted out the locomotive  patrick
this iron monster weighed s - tons had
cylinders  by  inches a single pair of
drivers  feet in diameter and carried a
steam pressure of  pounds on january
  the patrick had achieved the
remarkable feat of hauling  open cars
weighing  pounds and  covered cars
weighing  pounds each with loads
which brought the total weight of the train
up to  tons a distance of  miles in
two hours and fifteen minutes

  how the pasteboards were handled

  the heaviest grade on the line was 
feet per mile this was the record for a
locomotive of its weight but the  stoning-
ton which weighed a trifle over a ton more
than the  patrick and having larger cylin-
ders and smaller drivers hauled a train of
 cars making a load of  tons 
miles in  minutes

  the rolling stock owned by the company
early in  consisted of  locomotives 
passenger-cars  baggage-cars and   bur-
then  cars ten miles of the track was laid
with h rails and  miles with fish-belly
rails the  general agent at a salary
of  a year was the chief executive in
charge of everything the laws of massa-
chusetts required a brakeman to each two
passenger-cars the hrakemen got  a
month and it also took two conductors at 
a month to run a train

  this plan of having two conductors to a
train was not peculiar to massachusetts on
the new jersey railroad in  two con-
ductors were required on a passenger-train
of six four-wheeled cars and a baggage-car
which made the run between new brunswick
and new york at the rate of twenty miles
an hour one conductor went through the
train and sold tickets to all passengers who
boarded it at way-stations while the other
followed and collected them

  the selling conductor was furnished with
a supply of tickets every morning in the
evening he turned in his cash and unsold
tickets only the terminal stations at new
york and new brunswick could afford the
luxury of ficket-agents but  superintendent
of transportation george l schuyler
declared over his signature december 
 that the double conductor scheme had
been tried for two years and had given
satisfaction

  on the long island railroad at the

same time  ticket - masters  instead of
agents at  a year sold the tickets and
kept a record of the receipts the name of
the locomotive the number of cars and pas-
sengers the starting time and amount re-
ceived for baggage and other details at
that time passengers were allowed fifty
pounds of baggage free while excess bag-
gage had to pay two and one-half cents a
mile for each hundred pounds

  a conductor also at  a year collected
the tickets the engineer on the passenger
locomotive which burned a cord of wood
that cost  in running forty-eight miles
and required daily two dollars worth of re-
pairs received two dollars a day his fire-
man and the brakeman each received half
that sum which simplified bookkeeping for
thirty days simply meant thirty dollars

  but to return to the massachusetts rail-
roads each road was operated by its own
code of rules regardless of what its neigh-
bors did for example the rules on the
boston and worcester required a freight-
train to wait at a meeting-point forty-five
minutes for the opposing train if it had
not arrived at the end of that time the con-
ductor was to take the engine and go and
find out what was wrong

  on the boston and providence a train
was required to wait fifteen minutes only at
meeting-points then if the opposing train
didnt show up a brakeman was sent with
the  sign of a brakeman which was a blue
flag to hunt up the tardy train if at the
end of another quarter of an hour neither
train nor brakeman had appeared the wait-
ing train was to proceed with due care and
prudence if a train was delayed on the
road for thirty minutes the rules required
that a brakeman be sent ahead with a blue
flag

odd practises of early railroaders

  in those early days the station-agent was
no mere bric-a-brac he had to do something
for his salary on the boston and provi-
dence where the agents were dignified with
the title of master of transportation they
had first to sell the tickets which were let-
tered like theater tickets now with the cars
labeled to correspond

  and then they went out and collected
theirf with the assistance of die conductor
while the train waited at the station it
was no sinecure either one train on sep-
tember   carried  passengers ma-
king the run of forty-one miles from boston


the railroad mans magazine

to providence in two hours and thirty-five
minutes

  on the boston and worcester the locomo-
tive department was under the immediate
charge of the  depot-masters otherwise the
agents who were held responsible for the
good condition of engines and cars and who
were required to expedite the movement of
trains and give orders to the enginemen

   in case of accident it was the  master of
transportation not the conductor who was
required under the rules to take the necessary
steps to get the disabled engines and cars on
to the nearest turnout and open the line
again but it was in winter that the agent
got what was coming tv him in an order
dated december  s j f curtis su-
perintendent of the boston and worcester
thus lays down the law

   during the present winter it is expected
that the road will be cleared of snow princi-
pally by engines and snow-plows and the
services of snow contractors will therefore be
dispensed with unless specially called upon
the agents at the depots are expected after
a heavy fall of snow to turn out with a horse
and scraper and a few men and pass over
the track from one depot to the other to wit

the duties of a station-agent

   here follows explicit instructions defining
the limits within which each agent is respon-
sible for cleaning the track the order then
continues

  the proper team will consist of two
horses and four men it is especially neces-
sary to turn out promptly after a wet storm
of snow and rain as severe cold usually fol-
lows last year the road was closed for a
week for want of a few hours labor at the
right time activity and energy oii- the part
of agents will be duly appreciated by the
corporation

  engineers too had to do something for
their two dollars a day they could not
show up at the last minute before leaving-
time wearing kid gloves and a cigarette and
turn their engine over to a hostler as soon as
they came to a stop at the end of their runs

  when they were not on the road they were
expected to tinker up their machines here
is an extract from the rules for their guidance
on the boston and worcester

  no engine-man will be employed who
does not feel and show by his conduct regard
for the interests of the company by taking
great care of his valuable machine examin-
ing her closely seeing that she is kept in

fine order well oiled and fit for the road
and when out being careful how she is run

  and maybe they didnt teach the fireman
his place the boston and lowell preferred
common hands at a dollar a day for firemen
because they were less likely to aspire to
become enginemen such men were sup-
posed to be more content with their pay and
their jobs than mechanics possessing a knowl-
edge of the engine that would fit them to
take charge of it

the first railroad organization

  after they had once got started the new
england railroads and the men who oper-
ated them made wonderfully rapid prog-
ress for a time new england railroad men
were the first in the world to appreciate the
benefits of organization the first of all
railroad organizations was proposed at a
preliminary meeting held april   in
boston at which isaac hinckley charles
f gove onslow stearns s h p lee
william a crocker george haven luther
haven john russell jr william parker
william raymond lee waldo higginson
charles minot and s m felton were pres-
ent

  at a second meeting held on may  
the organization was formed under the name
of the new england association of rail-
road superintendents with charter members
representing twenty-five railroads

  this organization at its meeting october
  for the first time in the history of
the railroad took steps to adopt a standard
time instead of local time for the movement
of trains a resolution was adopted in which
it was declared that the association was  sen-
sible of the great importance of a uniform
standard of time upon railroads in new eng-
land the time of a meridian thirty miles
west of boston was adopted as the standard
and this time was put into effect on fifteen
railroads november  s

  meanwhile the western railroad which
was to form a part of the line to the hudson
river chartered in  was growing slow-
ly the first sixteen miles were graded in
 and the first train ran into springfield
october   on september   the
road was completed to washington summit
the western end of the route under the name
of the albany and west stockbridge rail-
road was completed from greenbush across
the river from albany to chatham four
corners a distance of twenty-three miles de-
cember  
early railroad days in new england



  by using fifteen miles of the hudson and
berkshire railroads track a through route
between boston and the hudson was estab-
lished nine years after first breaking soil
through trains were running over this two
hundred miles of road crossing a summit at
an altitude of fourteen hundred feet above
sea level in ten hours and forty-five minutes

an influx of lines

  other roads were growing in every direc-
tion not only in massachusetts but in ver-
mont new hampshire maine rhode is
land and connecticut in  massachu-
setts was the proud possessor of seven trunk-
lines and other railroads amounting in the
aggregate to  miles representing a cost
of  in  they carried -
 passengers and  tons of
freight earning 

  every one of the thirty-two towns of 
inhabitants or more in the state had one or
more railroads while seventy-three out of
ninety-eight towns having a population be-
tween  and  were on railroads a
police count made by order of the city mar-
shal showed that on september   
passenger-trains carrying  passengers
arrived in boston and  trains carrying
 passengers departed

  for twenty years work this was a pretty
good showing and this wasnt all for these
massachusetts railroads made connections
with  miles of railroads outside the
state which had cost the builders -
 all these roads brought trade to bos-
ton which was the basis for an era of pros-
perity unparalleled in the history of the city

bostons railroad jubilee

  under the circumstances mayor john p
bigelow and the city council with the co-
operation of the rest of the city felt war-
ranted in arranging for a railroad jubilee
on september   and   the
specific excuse for this jubilee was the open-
ing of railroad communication between bos-
ton and canada in his proclamation dated
august   fixing the time for the ju-
bilee mayor bigelow felicitated boston upon
the fact

   the several lines connecting us with can-
ada northern new york the great lakes
and the far west are now complete uniting
us by railroad and steam navigation with
thirteen states of the union comprising an
area of  square miles the two cana-

das the lakes with their  miles of coast
and bringing within our commercial sphere a
population of  inhabitants

  a committee of seven led by francis brin-
ley president of the council was sent to to-
ronto to invite the earl of elgin and kin-
cardine governor-general of canada and
other dignitaries and leading citizens of to-
ronto montreal and quebec to attend the
jubilee the committee starting august 
went by way of northfield vermont- and
rouses point to ogdensburg covering the
four hundred miles at an average speed of
twimty-two miles an hour including stops
from ogdensburg they went to lewiston
hamilton and toronto by steamer

  canada received the bostonians hospitably
and heard of the coming jubilee with great
enthusiasm the committee returned home
by way of montreal and quebec reaching
boston august  after a journey of eighteen
hundred miles

welcome wearies the president

  the railroad jubilee was quite the biggest
celebration ever seen in new england up to
that time president fillmore who had ta-
ken part in the celebration to commemorate
the completion of the erie railroad from
piermont on the hudson to dunkirk on lake
erie on may  and  of the same year at-
tended accompanied by mrs fillmore sec-
retary of war charles m conrad and secre-
tary of the interior alexander h h stewart

  the bostonians certainly did their best to
make president fillmore glad he came a
committee met him in new york and es-
corted him by steamboat to fall river there
a committee from the legislature met him and
welcomed him again at dorchester he was
welcomed some more besides the railroad
track was sprinkled so that the dust might
not irritate the presidential nose

  from dorchester the party proceeded in
carriage over a well-sprinkled road to rox-
bury where the president was welcomed
again he finally reached the revere house
in boston at  pm on the th and after
an hours rest was taken over to the state
house where governor george s boutwell
delivered the final welcome himself

  this surfeit of welcome was too much for
president fillmore and he was unable to
ride in the procession on the third day of
the jubilee which was to be regretted be-
cause the prettiest girl in all boston had been
selected to present him with a bouquet she
was so flustered that she could not distinguish

f

between the president and the humbler citi-
zen who had been selected to ride in the
presidential carriage but addressed the proxy
is mr president

  a tent had been spread on boston com-
mon in which a dinner at which thirty-six
hundred sat down was given fillmore could
not eat a mouthful but he did manage to at-
tend long enough to make excuses and say
adieu to his hosts after which he started at
once for washington lord elgin was less
fortunate for he had to listen to speeches
undl after dark as no candles had been
provided since the dinner began at  pm
die orators reluctandy knocked off when it
grew too dark to see their victims

  while massachusetts was so busy being
proud of her railroads her neighbors over in
maine were working hard to establish a con-
nection with montreal no other state in
the union is so deeply indebted to one man
for its railroad systemas maine that one
mans name is known wherever railroads are
known it is mentioned perhaps oftener
than that of any other man among those who
have been connected with railroads this
napoleon of die rail was john alfred poor
whose family has given its name to that great-
est of railroad classics poors manual

poors first locomotive

  john alfred poor a country lawyer from
wav daown east happened to be in boston in
april  when the first section of the bos-
ton and worcester railroad was opened his
inborn yankee curiosity led him to go to see
the event the first locomotive in new eng-
land was imported from england as was also
its engineer the latter was fully conscious
of the dignity and importance of his position

  when the engine-an iron monster weigh-
ing eight tons without any such superfluities
a- bell whistle sand-box headlight pilot
trucks cab steam-gage water-glass springs
injector brake or jacket-responded to die
opening of the dirottle and actually began to
move poor said that his hair actually stood
on end and he forgot to breathe

  the sight so he often averred made the
most profound impression his mind ever re-
ceived in the course of a busy life he was
twenty-six fears old at the time-old enough
to take an intelligent and efficient part in
the task of providing his country with the
transportation facilities it needed and he took
up the task at once

  from that day until he died at the age of
sixty-three he devoted himself heart and soul

to the railroad his reward consisted largely
of the consciousness of a great duty well done
for he was not the kind of promoter who lines
his pocket at the expense of others

  maine was poor and its people few but a
trifle like that could not discourage a man with
the enthusiastic imagination and practical
good sense of john alfred poor in 
the first railroad in maine promoted by poor
was opened from bangor to oldtown that
same year the legislature provided for sur-
veys to find the shortest and most practicable
route from belfast to quebec but nothing
was done

  in s a survey from portland to lake
champlain was authorized but again noth-
ing happened

a pioneer promoter

  in  poor made public his plans for a
railroad from portland to montreal which
now forms a part of the grand trunk and
for a second line from portland to st john
and halifax for the next two years he went
about addressing public meetings in behalf
of his scheme and he also traveled over the
proposed route to montreal a company was
organized and surveys begun in 

   boston had already started in the race for
montreal over three different routes each of
which had agents out soliciting aid boston
had all the advantages for it had the most
people and money being the metropolis of
new england and one of the greatest cities
on the continent

  portland then had a population of only
fifteen thousand and all its earthly posses-
sions wouldnt have amounted to five million
dollars at a liberal appraisement the proud
bostonians sneeringly referred to portland as
a small fishing town

  but no city could be considered weak or
helpless which had so energetic a champion as
poor boston was having everything its own
way and its agents in montreal had nearly
succeeded in winning canadian support when
poor hearing how things were going made
a forced journey in a sleigh through the wil-
derness from portland to montreal in the
dead of winter arriving in time to prevent
the board of trade from adopting a resolution
in favor of the boston route

portland wins out

   poors next move was to arrange for a race
by teams with mail from portland and boston
to montreal as a practical demonstration of
early railroad days in new england



the superiority of the maine route the race
which was run with mails from the same
steamer resulted in a victory for portland
by the very comfortable margin of twelve
hours that settled it with the canadians
and they adopted the portland route

  the atlantic and st lawrence railroad
company which was organized to build the
american end of the line turned the first sod
at portland july   while the cana-
dians began on their end soon after there
was the usual difference of opinion about the
gage

   poor being fearful that the more powerful
jnterests in massachusetts might gobble his
pet road favored the s-feet--inch gage pro-
posed by a e morton the chief engineer
chiefly because it had been adopted as the
british government standard in india instead
of  feet  inches the gage of the massa-
chusetts roads the broad gage was accord-
ingly adopted and this led to the adoption of
the same gage for the great western railroad
of canada

  railroad building in the wilderness is a
costly luxury under any circumstances and
altogether beyond the means of a small fish-
ing town in  the company was
short of funds and ruin seemed inevitable
poor came to the rescue with an idea
which was all he had to give on his
advice the contract for building the whole-
line was let to black wood  co at a fancy
price as the only means of salvation the
plan worked and the road two hundred and
forty-six miles long was built the first
through train leaving portland for montreal
july  

to shorten european routes

  poor who in  had bought the ameri-
can railroad journal founded in  that
he might the more effectively spread the rail-
road propaganda and who in s was
elected president of the new york and cum-
berland railroad redoubled his efforts in be-
half of the line from portland to halifax a
trifle of eight hundred and thirty-five miles
in order to establish a short route from
london to new york

  the completion of the britannia tubular
bridge over menai straits in  enabled the

london and northwestern to run trains
through from london to holyhead whence
steamers crossed to dublin in three and a half
hours the midland railway of ireland
by the summer of  was built half-way
from dublin to galway from which port it
was only two thousand miles to halifax
poor thought the time would come when
steamers could cross between galway and
halifax in five days and from london to
new york in seven days

  a company under the imposing name of
the european and north american railway
company was accordingly chartered in 
the road was opened for traffic in  with a 
great celebration in which the president of the
united states and the governor-general of
canada took part

poofs prediction

  it must be confessed however that as part
of an international route the road has not
been a conspicuous success anybody who is
in a hurry to-day can beat poors estimated
time from london to new york two full days

  poor did not fail very often however he
had a better comprehension of the future pos-
sibilities of the railroad than most men of
his day as the following extract from a speech
he made at belfast maine july   will
prove

   the coarser work of constructing the road-
bed of railways is now understood and we
cannot expect any diminution in the cost of
building it but in the construction of the roll-
ing-stock in the quality of the superstruction
in economy of management and in the supply
of comforts to travelers great changes are to
take place

   wooden sleepers kianized or preserved in
creosote will outlast the iron rail if not main-
tain a life equal to that of the steel rail which
is gradually taking the place of the iron rail
being more than five times as durable steel
boilers for locomotives will be found superior
to iron ones and cars will be adjusted with
conveniences comforts and luxuries unknown
at this day enabling travelers to cross the
continent without fatigue and affording to
business men facilities for carrying on com-
munication by letter or telegraph while the
cars are in motion 

a little authority makes some men as overbearing as the high rail on a
      curve-casuistries of the fourth asst roadmaster

but mine was better mine was my flesh and blood

my flesh and blood

by j r stafford

               when the presidents car was run onto siding 
               unterburner realized the answer to his question

nterburner knew why he
had been ordered to slip ufr-
noticed through the yards to
hilliss private car an in-
vestigation to ascertain why
switchmen were always get-
ting killed in ruin junction had been re-
quested by the state legislature the presi-
dent of the g and t had come in person to
secure first-hand such thunder as he could
to use against the railroad commissioners

  though unterburner considered an inves-
tigation all foolishness-he had run the
switch engine in ruin junction yards every-
day for fourteen years-nevertheless he felt
resentful as he plodded to the tryst it was
contemptible to go clandestinely about the
defense of an honest position so in his own
eyes his obedience was contemptible

  when at length he came to the car which

was on siding  with the forward trucks
against a barricade of bolted ties secure
against running off down the grade he felt
more disturbed than ever about his summons
moreover the appointment seemed more like
that of thieves than of honest men for in
the gloom of the smoke and fading day the
car was as dark as egypt however he
swung up onto the platform and after five
minutes spent in rattling the knob and
thumping the glass panel he succeeded in
getting some one to open the door a crack
and ask who in a guarded tone

  he was quickly commanded to enter he
stumbled forward into absolute darkness

  the door closed softly behind him there
was a click and the whole interior of the
car seemed to explode in a blaze of lights
a young man with a wide fiat mouth looked
up from his stealthy manipulation of the


the railroad mans magazine

thumb-catch under the brass knob and
smiling craftily as if this were a vastly
shrewd achievement whispered

  everything is on the q t here when
you get ready to go just pull the door shut
easy i wont be here ill be watching out-
side

  unterburner wishing that he might wring
the fellows neck turned the other way

   president hillis seated at a little flat desk
smiled up at him hillis was bulky-his
features were coarse and his eyes were dull
he suggested some ponderous slow monster
apt to crush unwittingly yet suddenly his
eyes narrowed as if to shrewdly say now
i have you 

  he waved with surprising ease to a chair
unterburner did not sit down it made
him uneasy to think of sitting in such a pres-
ence

  now said hillis apparently heedless
of the silent refusal  what do you honestly
think about the yards in ruin junction
there was an emphasis-on honestly
that disgusted the switchman in retalia-
tion for this and the whole dirty business he
would have lied if he could but as fact
was fact to him and anything else impos-
sible he grudgingly answered

   i think the yards are safe enough for men
who dont get drunk and lose their heads
of course the sidins all lay at grade but
everbody knows that theyre paid to know
that and keep it in mind thats why wages
in ruin junction are twenty per cent higher
than they are in any other yard but they
dont keep it in mind thats why they git
killed i know ive been runnin the switch
engine here every day for fourteen year
president hillis squeezed his hands to-
gether with a rasping noise and chuckled
silently bending his head forward and
dropping his voice to a very low tone he
said

  good mighty good unterburner by
the way the division superintendent here
has been telling me that youve put in all
these ver here so that the extra pay might
enable you to send your boy through college
the son of such a fatherought to have a
chance im going to sec that he gets one
unterburner would have given his body
for a sure foothold for his son but he shrank
from this apparent gratuity of the ruler of
the g and t he felt himself flushing as if
under an insult and he muttered

  im much obliged to ye but i guess ye
neednt bother

  hillis laughed uneasily he studied unter-

bumers face for a long time finally he
said as if quite anew you are going to
tell the commissioners just what you told me
a little bit ago was your honest opinion of
the yards 

   yes i shall tell them what i honestly
think then as it dawned upon him that
the offer had been intended as a bribe he
clapped his greasy cap onto his white head
and started for the door

   wait a minute you are not going to
let any one know youve been down here
no he choked in his resentment i
shall not it might be said that i was
fixed that shall not be said about me
even as a lie

   without a hint of leave-taking he slammed
the door behind him never in all his life
had he been so deeply offended

  on his way home as he sat smoking his
pipe on the back porch and later as he
tossed in his bed he kept thinking about
the incident he finally dismissed it by
making up his mind that he had done the
proper thing but even as he slept he
dreamed dreams of anger

  next morning he decided to change his
views concerning the yards-if that were pos-
sible all of that day as he steamed up and
down the sidings he watched for anything
that might enable him truthfully to assert
this yard is dangerous even for an ex-
perienced switchman

  this effort however brought him nothing
more than bafflement though switchmen
missed couplings as usual and as usual cars
started to run off down the inclines the men
always out of harms way would jump nim-
bly up the ladders and put on the hand
brakes

  not even a bumper beam had the dust
shaken off it that day somehow this proof
of his life-time convictions about the yards
displeased him when night came he was
suspicious of some crookedness

  as they were leaving the roundhouse he
overheard hogan and miller talking about
extra pay he stopped to ask whos
drawin extra pay an whos givin it

  did ye not know thot prisidint hilliss
private car wor in the yarruds aal the
noight hogan demanded with a broad
grin aan thot seein it wad cost a pot av
money should the commissioners rayquire the
yarruds to be graded his honor prisidint
hillis is wisely spinding a few dollars to
have the yarruds kept fray av accdints
unterburner was more disturbed than ever
he walked swiftly away from the pair he
my flesh and blood



despiseu tne company of such silly fools who
would take money from the hands of hillis
for anything else than honest labor

  all the way home he tried to twist out of
this revelation some argument that might arm
him for attack on the yards but the only
thing he could see in it was just the thing he
had always said and believed that nothing
would ever happen to switchmen if they only
had something to make them keep their wits

  realizing that his own statement had sug-
gested to hillis the plan of extra pay his
anger almost choked him more than ever
he wanted to do something against that man
the rage that comes of helpless anger pos-

   my boss the other replied

  and what if i do not let you  

  well then i will have to go back

  will you get your pay just the same
no i am only a space writer if i get
the story and its big enough to syndicate i
might make a hundred dollars if i dont
get it ill be out my time and expenses
unterburner thought it all over again
finally lie consented to the photographing
and the interview but when he had told his
last story he still had some after-doubts and
he asked  you say that your boss sent you
now how did your boss happen to think
of it

sessed him when he felt that all he could say
about the yards would be just what hillis
would say

  the next day as he sat brooding in his
cab with an hour of idleness before him he
still saw himself between the devil and the
deep sea and he was anxious to get his
mind onto anything else

  a smooth-looking young man came along-
side the engine he had a pad of paper in
his pocket a camera tripod under one arm
is your name unterburner he asked
yes what do you want o me

   i am a newspaper man i want to get
your picture and then some of your experi-
ences in the yards	
who sent you unterburner thought
the young mans ears lay too close to his
head but thinking of his son who was about
the age of this fellow he would be kind to
him if it were possible

  well i cant say unless maybe he got
it from president hillis  understand that
president hillis and the chief of the sheet
i hang to are pretty close of course hillis
would want such a story it might help a
little with the railroad commissioners

   then you must not print it unter-
burner objected quietly not having had ex-
perience of the ways of young reporters  i
will not be talkin to do that man any
good

  the other as if suddenly attracted by the
sight of something in the gangway edged
into it and quickly down the steps to the
ground

   come back here  the engineman threat-
ened  come back here 

  the one on the ground was already in full
flight alongside the switch

  unterburner caught up a wrench intend-
ing to knock the fellow down but being on

you are not going to let

    any one know youve
    been down here


the railroad man s magazine

  slowly he made his way to where the
wrench had fallen more slowly he saun-
tered back to his cab he was trying to
discover a proper reason for the wish that it
had been hillis and that hillis could not
have escaped he knew that for one wild
moment it would have filled him with keen-
est pleasure to have battered the president to
death as he had always had a great revul-
sion of murder he was curious to know why
he felt no revulsion at the thought of what he
would have done had the chance offered
what had the official done nothing more
than local politicians had done in the cam-
paigns-offered him something for doing a
certain thing

that was all

apparently there was no difference-he
could see no difference-yet he felt there
must be a great one he had been able to
laugh at the ward-heelers but the
more he thought of hillis the more
tightly would his throat contract
and his muscles jerk wondering
at the significance of this in-
stinctively hating whatever it
might be he tried with all his
might to drive it from his mind
and heart

  for a couple of weeks he kept
battling with himself and with his
thoughts he grew afraid yet he
knew his fear was only anger
turnedupon itself

  when the paper containing the
reporters story came he pounced
upon it eager to see what it might
develop in his brain

  the story and the pictures il-
lustrating it covered a whole page
it was a good story it made a
hero of him his wife peering
over his shoulder read and cried
over the article

  but instead of being pleased
he only experienced a great un-
easiness he kept asking himself
over and over again now what
will come of this he knew it
would be something hateful to him-and for
this he hated hillis

  when he returned from work a few eve-
nings afterward he found his son-a line
lad with eyes full of tire and a frame like a
gladiator-awaiting him instead of the cus-
tomary delight at sight of the youngster
unterburner trembled from head to feet he
knew just what the answer would be but
he did ask

realized that he had nothing at all against
that mere boy though he knew that the
latter was far out of danger he felt his
knees quaking and cold sweat on his body

  what if he had killed the lad like a
flash it came over him that all this like all
the rest was hilliss work at the thought
his knees stiffened he felt the cold sweat no
more instead his breath was coming hard
and his fists were clenching

the right-hand side of the cab when he faced
the rear he could not swing his arm effec-
tively by the firue he had  cat-a-cornered 
through the gangway and down the steps
and poised himself on the cinders the runner
was a hundred yards away nevertheless
he drew back and hurled the spanner with
all his might

  the instant the iron left his hand he

he stopped to

ask whos
drawin extra
pay ax whos
givin it 
my flesh and blood



  why did you come home

  mostly because of that article in the
sunday supplement it made me want to
come home to work in the yards so that you
might have it easier and-and i would like
to learn to do what youve done

  unterburners lips which were always
tightly closed when he wasnt speaking now
shut until they showed only a thin line his
eyes that were always wide because of the
great strain of his work the strain of watch-
ing where failure to see in time meant death
now stared wider than ever

  he was thinking this is the significance
of it all as his thought ran back to that
night in the private car when hillis had
mentioned a chance for the boy and he had
refused the offer it came to him that hillis
had designed it just as it had fallen with
a mighty oath he wheeled out of the house
and running blindly down through the yards
came at last to division headquarters

  the yard-master into whose arms he blun-
dered at the door looked up and asked
whats the matter with ye unterburner
whats happened  

   my boy has come  he choked over
the statement as if the fact implied some
terrible consequence  hell be down here
to ask ye for a job ye must not give it to
him 

   all right the other promised  ill not
hire him-unless of course something should
happen to make me

  this was all unterburner could ask so he
started for home on the way he overtook
hogan

  at first the irishman was unsociable but
at length he thawed enough to ask if the
engineman had heard the news

   my son came home unterburner re-
plied as if the incident were matter of public
concern

  woosha phwat the divil do thot
amount to th sthory yiz had thim print
in the paypers has caused the commission to
lave be the invistigatin av the yarruds so
the extra wages ended to-night

  unterburners heart thumped against his
ribs things were coming fast now he
thought of his son who had been strangely
dragged into this net of circumstance and
he shivered

  but it was not a net of circumstance it
was the work of hillis

  he panted under hisfury

  when he reached the house he could not
bring himself to open the door retracing
his steps into the yard he walked up and

   	rr

down trying to think what it was that must
surely be coming

  he could imagine nothing more terrible
than that the boy should get work in the
yards but as the boy was not a fool this
was not so terrible he could not rid him-
self of his thoughts and all night long he
walked up and down the narrow yard

  by morning however he had made up his
mind entering the house he found the
others astir he said to them  i shall quit
work i am going down now to throw up
my job

   ho-ho  the boy laughed delightedly
 i didnt have any hope of you taking my
plan so readily i will go down with you
perhaps they will let me have your engine
 you shall not we are going to leave
this place we must get away from here at
once 

  are you crazy his wifeasked her
eyes popping from her head  where would
we go what would we do for a house
we cannot sell this one so there would be
no way of getting money to buy another
we could not rent this one so there would be
no money to pay rent anywhere else unter-
burner if you had ever done such a thing
before id think you had been out all night
carousing have you  

   no he retorted angrily  you know
better than that weve got to leave here
thats all

   why   they both asked at once with
sudden emphasis

  though he knew that he could not an-
swer though he knew full well that his
attempt to answer would only seem foolish
he plunged then rambled on somehow he
could not say the one thing he really wished
to say i hate hillis

  he could not say that because he saw
no good and honest reason for his hatred

  then as they stood open-mouthed look-
ing at him he felt the hair prickle on the
back of his neck and a kind of cold con-
traction of his scalp for the thought had
struck him that he was playing a part in this
awful thing that must come to pass a
foolish part just as he had been now playing
but a part necessary to be played

  with a mighty resolution he sought to
throw it off he would be a man he would
assert his unshakable unconcern of the things
that could not strike him unless he blun-
dered in their way so he smiled as best he
could and said

  i was only joking i was worried and
could not sleep last night so i feel foolish


the railroad mans magazine

waited to destroy the man whereupon
the conviction always came that when
the time did come he would be unable
to play his part

  why should he want the man killed
there was no reason-not the sign of a
reason at this he would seem to sink
and sink but just as he was groveling
to helplessness something would whis-
per there will be a reason and again
he would tower and press his way with
titanic stride

      thus pausing then running stopping
again and bounding on he came late to
the roundhouse-but late as he was he
was earier than the switching-crew

    automatically he backed his engine
out onto the house track and whistled
the call for hands automatically too
he saw the men come straggling along
their eyes red their feet dragging some-
how he seemed to know as from years
back that they had been on a drunk
because of the cutting off of the extra pay
he knew what must follow this

it came twenty minutes latter donneley
his hands too nervous to unlock the main-
line switch in time missed opening it the
brakes would not hold back enough the
switch-engine with miller and hogan and
campbell sitting on its buffer-beam dashed
into the end of a long string of loaded box-
cars miller and hogan jumped but camp-
bell fell under the wheels

then like the march of things that had
been coming to these moments for ten thou-
sand years he saw campbells body removed
and carried over to the platform of the gloomy
red station a baggage-truck run out the
stained old sheet of gray canvas tucked and
carefully concealing and on the gray board
underneath the truck and the canvas he knew
that the little brown puddles were growing
drop by drop

  as that dark pageantry passed another
darkly significant took its place the white-
faced switchmen stood for a moment at the
foot of the stairs leading up to the division
superintendents office one slowly ascend-
ed presently he reappeared at the door
behind him unterburner saw his own son

  wild agony wrenched the heart-strings of
the engineer he would stop this accursed
progress of inordinate sacrifice but even in
his resolution lie knew that he would fail

  when they came alongside the engine he
could only say to the boy  addicks prom-
ised me that he wouldnt hire you

  yes the boy laughed but i asked the

 i want to get
your picture
and some
of your
experiences

this morning i will be all right after i get
to work

  even as he said this he felt his heart leap
and pound and he knew that this intention
was but another step in the way of the thing
that would come to pass

  his wife mistaking the reason of his agi-
tation smiled as she observed i knew you
would go back to work

  this frightened him more than ever

  after breakfast he hurried to the round-
house the climax was a certainty at the
end of eveiy heart-checking cessation of his
faculties it seemed to him that his strength
for the crisis failed he would think of
hillis as the author of it all and then he
would grow gigantic in his will and power
to slay but then after each panting strug-
gle as in his mind he had already done the
deed he would fall to wondering why he

superintendent about it and he said he had
been ordered by president hillis not long
ago to let me have a job when there was a
vacancy

   unterburner struggled like a man bound
 feebly he threatened ill quit the engine

    yiz will thin turn the ingin over to the
 by hogan observed  i had that frum
 addicks jist a minute ago in case yiz tuk a
 notion to quit it sames he has also been
 hob-nobbin wid the prisidint it wor the
 prisidints order

   unterburner felt himself falling a thou-
 sand miles his strength- was going sud-
 denly as he realized his unmanning weakness
 he hurled it away he would be himself
 he must be himself he would conquer it
 all in spite of all what was there to unman
 him in the fact that his son was working by
 his side the boy was no fool like other
 men like other men he had eyes and ears
 and arms and legs and strength and the wit
 to use them all when they were needed

   but even as lie opened the throttle there
 came to him for the first time in his life doubt
 of his theory in the practise of other men
 why had he been able to live through four-
 teen years in the yards when the other nearest
 record was only eighteen months and that
 one had ended in a death 

   he puzzled over it but in some way he
 missed the connection then the needs of
 the work withdrew him there were thirty
 loaded cars to be backed in from siding 
 onto  and then to the top of  which was
 half a mile away as he nursed his steam
 the question kept coming back and back
 again suddenly the notion seized him that
 the answer of this would be inevitable be-
 cause within that answer lay
 the hidden meaning of many
 things a
 great calmness
 possessed him
 the patience to
 wait a century

   suddenly a
 yell rose from
 -the front of
 the engine it thrilled
 him through and
 through he looked
 and saw hogan and
 miller piling off the
 buffer-beam on his
 side looking on past
 the switch into siding
  he saw a single
 empty had been left

up there the night before now broken loose
and running wildly down to the end of his
train

  his heart seemed tearing itself from his
breast it was not because he knew that
his boy was sitting in the middle of the buffer-
beam confident of the father in the cab not
because any harm might come to the boy
not anything of that sort

  his frenzy was the realization of the awful
truth that he had failed to see when he should
have seen he flung himself upon the revers-
ing lever while his left hand shooting out
played like a nozzle of fingers on the throttle-
turn

  he was in reverse he started to open the
throttle the throttle stuck he felt the
train check pause and then start back-but
this would not be enough

  he wrenched at the throttle with both
hands he could not open it it would not
open

  there came the long volleying crash of
bumpers pounding against each other down
a grade it came with the crackling crash of
accelerating fire from automatic guns un-
terburner reached for the air-valve to die
train he missed it he set the engine-
brakes the drivers locked from the head
end came the roar of an exploding gun
then fell a silence like the grave

  he did not need hogans gibberish for it
he knew what had happened on the buffer-
beam it had happened in the sequence of
the seeds of destiny he did not even get
down out of the cab sitting at his window

it was a good story it made a hero of him


the railroad mans magazine

he saw once more the pageantry of ruin
junction

  before his eyes there passed in solemn re-
view the first fatality he had witnessed in the
yards die next the next the next and so on
down through the years-down through the
years until this moment when his son the
last lay dead

  he knew the answer of his question now

   it is but a matter of time until men and
equipment fail

  like die flash of the sun at morning he
saw diat failure in ruin junction yards meant
death for the man who failed

  through die blinding horror of that truth
something bright and glittering swept by for
an instant he did not comprehend what it
was he thought it was something super-
natural but as his vision focused he saw a
burnished engine on the main track slowing
down behind the engine rolled a blind-
drawn private car the special stopped dead
still he felt a vaster strength than he had
ever felt in the air of battles

  a man swung down from the engine on the
main line he ran over to unterburners
crew he shouted to them president
hilliss private car is to go down to the foot
of this siding as usual its to lie there all
day so you fellows be careful hes wore
out with a six-day fight with the railroad
commission be careful hes asleep 

  unterburner saw the special glide smooth-
ly down to a cross-switch leading to 
deftly the car was cut off held and then al-
lowed to slip alone into the channel of the rails
that ended far away in a barricade of rails

  then so calmly that they could not com-

prehend him he asked his men  have you
got the boys body out 

  hogan nodded

 close the switch after me when i get in
the heat had gone out of die throttle-
ctem no- the throttle opened he pushed
his forty crs on up the way until his engine
too was on i reversing he started back

  phwat the divil mane yiz did yiz
not list now heai it said we woi to kape aff
this sidin 

  but unterburner straining at die throttle
to open to the widest only flung back this
wild answer

   im goin to finish my work in ruin
junction yards

  down that steep siding swept the heavy
engine under full head with the weight of
flying tons behind it leaped like a thing
gone mad to slay unterburner his white
hair streaming in the wind his lips like a
knife-edge his wide eyes widened to their
whites danced upon the jostling coal-heap of
his tender

  as he danced he yelled mad phrases at the
helpless car below

  you man-trap high wages was the
bait in yours   but mine was better mine
could never fail mine was my flesh and
blood

  then came the crash of tender on car of
car on bolted barricade of ties through the
debris that shot up from where the presidents
car had stood the switch-engine heaving up-
ward reared and toppled back upon the
wreck and the smoke rose like a black pall
from the finished work of ruin junctions

observations of a country
station-agent

by j e smith

no -from plug to president or how henry the rube youth by
patient plodding and perseverance rose from poverty
to a private car

to

his is--a bit of biography written
at the request of nobody and
without any particular purpose
it was suggested by reading a
little story in a newspaper of a
railroad man who had gone up
prominence well known as an organizer
and as an executive who handles the destiny
of a network of railroads

  he made a trip to the old homestead in the
country to visit his mother

  this little incident of a sons affection is
nothing within itself every dutiful son-
whether prominent prosperous or otherwise
-visits his mother now and then

  but this particular man is high up he
does not follow the straggling line of varie-
gated humanity out of the smoker as most
of us do when we visit home he has his
private car with polished brass and observa-
tion end his coming is a matter of circum-
stance and flutter-another instance wherein
 honey-boy comes home to mama with the
bacon

  but the item of interest the newspaper
finds in the visit is this his private car side-
tracks at a little country station he is driven
four miles directly toward nowhere and

brings up at a small country house half hid-
den behind the luxury of shrubs and vines
protected by a faithful guard of patriarchal
trees

  this man of steel iron and electricity is
back home

  he came from a farm thats the point
he- went all the way from spring water to
the chamber of commerce and the stock
exchange that is a mighty distance it
makes us pause and take notice and write
of it as one of the startling possibilities of
american life

  it is hard to conceive how a boy brought
up in the companionship of a span of mules
and a holstein cow who treads down one
corn-row and up another can ever arrive at a
commanding position in the affairs of his
country yet when he does so every one is
proud to speak of it and point to the humble
surroundings of his childhood

  among our presidents we have had one who
was an expert rail-splitter one who divided
his time between the farm and a tannery and
another who personally conducted a mule
along the tow-path of a canal

  one summer after the cinch-bug had
ruined the wheat and the drought had fin-




the railroad mans magazine

ished the corn and two shotes had died of
the cholera the hero of this story turned his
yottthful face on agriculture and found a job
on the section at a dollar-ten per day

   then after a long session of tie tamping
he straightened up wiped the sweat from his
face and noticed the operator sitting in the
depot office with both feet on die table and
not even fanning himself

  many a weary and exhausted youth ta-
king note of two feet on a table has at once
heeded the beckoning finger of destiny thrown
aside die tools of manual labor and hurried
to the telegraph-office there as from a
cocoon he issues forth in due time a fledgling
and lights in a tower with a mandolin a red
necktie and balloon pants care-free and for-
getful of all die toil that has gone before and
justifying the conclusion that there are better
jobs than just hard work

  this particular boy from die farm went out
and talked with his mother

  somehow working on die section did not
appeal to him of course he could see his
way by long and faithful service of becom-
ing section-boss but he worked with such en-
ergy and faithfulness that he was afraid of
putting a crimp in his spine and he didnot
want to knot up his anatomy even to become
a section-boss

   so he consulted his mother

   being a faithful biographer i am anxious
like all biographers who have gone before to
lay stress on this all-important fact-he con-
sulted his mother

  the narrative of every great man contains
that paragraph about the dutiful and obe-
dient son and the wisdom and foresight of
the mother where she directs and advises
and he listens to her it doesnt matter how
much of this is exactly correct-it reads well
all other great men have done this and it
shall be so in this instance so once again-
he consults his mother

  i do not know why great men in their
youth never consult their fathers the biog-
rapher sees to it that the old man does not
muss up the picture by injecting his mattress
whiskers into the color scheme father al-
ways remains in the background he hustles
for the provender and gets no farther front
thanthe rear railing

  now there are various reasons for a boy
consulting his mother affection is the one
that makes the best reading in this case
however it was because mother alone was the
exalted keeper of the royal sock she had
it hid somewhere between the cabbage cave
and the attic it contained the family treas-

ure son was not onto the combination oh
piffle this almost spoils a good story

  coming back to strong and effective lines-
he consulted his mother

  mother said lie ive talked to the
agent at the depot and he says if i want to
learn telegraphy and depot work hell let me
come in there and hell teach me for fifty
dollars

   how much money will you have from
your work on the section henry asked
mother

  twenty-five dollars answered henry

   how do you know youll get a job after
youre through   asked mother

  you see mother had dealt with the
huckster-wagon man and itinerant pedlers
long enough to have her wits about her

  he says theres no trouble at all about
that answered the son  why ma do you
know what they make every month  

  ma shook her head

   some of them get as high as forty-five
dollars a month

  mercy me exclaimed mother you
could save a lot of money on them wages
but henry youve got to be sure of a job
how do you know if you pay him fifty dol-
lars right on the start liell do anything for
you henry youve got to be careful with
money you cant run any risks

  after other consultations between mother
and son and after further negotiations with
the agent at the depot the matter of sons
apprenticeship was arranged henry was to
pay five dollars a months for five months and
a final lump sum of twenty-five dollars when
he landed his first job

  mother guaranteed the faithful payment

  son boarded at home when he could use
a horse he rode otherwise he walked the
four miles daily taking his lunch with him

  in the fall it was arranged that henry was
to have a new suit of clothes out of the turkey
money to cost as much as eight dollars and
forty cents in this way he commenced a
railroad career that ended in a private car
with ebony porters and a french chef

  in the ordinary pursuit of life when a
boy goes in to learn a trade or business he is
known as an apprentice or helper and there
is some dignity and standing to his position

  a boy learning telegraphy is despised and
is an outcast from the beginning he is
known as a plug when he gets far
enough along to venture on the wire with a
few wild dots and dashes he becomes a
ham

   in the plug or early stages lie sweeps out
observations of a country station-agent



he rode back and forth to the station
morning and evening

the depot carries the mail looks after the
switch-lamps lugs in the coal and reaches
the point where he actually talks with the
brakeman of the local which lightens all
labor and makes happy the day

the plug makes rapid headway the
first two or three months he learns to send

to the day from die day he commenced learn-
ing

  a wise plug will not heed diese fairy
stories

  there are no three four or five mondi
operators they have nothing but pin-
feathers at that period they cannot deliver
the goods and if placed it is either at some
point where there are no goods to deliver or
they are rankly unfit for the service required

this word of encouragement is passed
along to the plug its a years work do

 v

 klodmkm

this is comparatively easy but the reverse
operation of hearing a combination of dots
and dashes and reducing them to writing is
the difficult thing and ordinarily requires
ayear or more of careful practise

  a plug can soon send but he cannot
receive learning to read it and put it down
is slow work and requires some perseverance
and runs into the months

  if a plug chances to converse with an
old operator about this time he is usually
cheered along and encouraged by being told
that lie the operator learned it in three
months and had a good job just four months

not take the four or five month prodigy seri-
ously make note of that when an operator
boasts of his aptitude and quickness to ar-
rive he hasnt gone much after he arrived
that is the proof of the pudding

  the speediest proposition in telegraphy is
the wiry red-headed freckled-faced irish
lad taken in the wild and without a frill in
any other direction he learns it faster and
he becomes the lightning-gear ten-words-be-
hind phenom

  this is not a joke it is a very sincere
tribute

  by a certain native nimble-witedness he
s

the railroad mans magazine

has the same natural aptitude for telegraphing
that his father had for police duty

  henry worked hard he had to dig ft all
out and treasure it away he consumed the
full year learning telegraphy but in the
meantime he learned a little more

  the agent gradually shifted the office-
work to henrys broad country shoulders and
henry emerged with a little knowledge of
billing expressing office accounts and car
reports

  this little stock of information got him a
job as agent at a very small station at a very
small salary a year later they changed
agents at henrys home village and henry
got the place

  he came back at a salary of forty-five dol-
lars per month-the princely figure that had
stirred his youthful imagination and kindled
his mothers fondest hopes

  henry was happy and envied a neighbor
dropped in to congratulate the parents and
 lowed as how henry was a powerful peart
boy and that hed make his mark and neednt
be surprised if henry wasnt township trustee
or somethin if they lived long enough ter
see it

  henry himself had neither ambition nor
thought of the future

  with one lightning bound he had arrived
the coveted job at home and the forty-five
dollars per month were his the world con-
tained nothing more

  he boarded at home and rode horseback
to and from the station every morning and
evening

  when a flayed and frazzle-nerved captain
of this strenuous day collapses he is hurried
off to a city- where a specialist turnson an
x-ray or some other contrivance for explora-
tion and torture but imposing enough in
hocus-pocus and legerdemain to extract a
fee of fifty dollars finds the victims nerves
shattered and that he is suffering from mal-
nutrition and various digestive disorders con-
sequent thereto and brought about by certain
dollar-chasing habits which he knows the
patient will not relinquish

  the specialist has but little in his phar-
macoposia that will do any good so he pre-
scribes daily horseback riding of ten miles
this brings back the sparkle and healthy
bloom so fully and freely described in the
breakfast-food ads

  horseback-riding is a fashionable pre-
scription it is high-class exclusive and
shows that the patient is under treatment of
a specialist of renown and can pay the price

  out in the country the old home doctor

tells the patient to  quit living like a durned
fool prescribes a little calomel and soda
and charges fifty cents

  thus without intention knowledge or
need in full adolescence and flower of youth
henry took on horseback-riding and built up
a constitution that was an asset for many
years to come the old-fashioned country
diet and hand-churned unadulterated but-
termilk aided and abetted in this

  many years later in the hurry and worry
of a different life henry paid over fifty dol-
lars and consulted a specialist

  he prescribed horseback-riding and real
country buttermilk

  there were not a great many things con-
nected with the duties of a station-agent in
a country town almost a generation ago to
sharpen the wit or develop the intellect so
that in pointing with pride to henrys career
and preluding it with  his first experience
was as station-agent at sulphur springs we
are not stating anything that has any par-
ticular bearing on the career or final outcome

  to a lay member who does not know it
sounds well to say he began as station-
agent at a small country town or that his
first work was on a section and he went up
and up until he became president of the
road

  that reads well in the biography its
chief purpose is to fire the imagination and
stimulate the hopes of the lowly

  henry hadnt much to do he had two
locals and four passenger-trains each week-
day he had a few reports to make up and
outside of these few duties he led a lazy and
indolent life looking into it closely it is
difficult to see wherein it is in any way
abetting or tributary to the high position of
the chief executive of the road

  however it must be written in his favor
that he did well what little there was to do

  henry had time enough to read josephus
plutarch and the life of the saints but
he was not much of a reader he had leisure
enough to have enabled him to have entered
the list of perpetual-motion inventors or to
have tackled the problem of a dirigible air-
ship but he was not mechanically inclined

  he just sat around on the job

  at the end of the month he wrote up the
monthly letter and comparative statement of
the business of the station he was glad to
report that there were three cars of sawdust
in sight to be shipped to kokomo for the
johnson ice-house and there might be a car
of potatoes for indianapolis but could not
say certain until next month ticket sales
observations of a country station-agent



showed a little falling off being  this
month against  the corresponding month
a year ago the explanation of this was that
fewer people were traveling

  it is to henrys credit that he wrote out
these comparative statements and explana-
tory letters very minutely he spelled cir-
cumstance with an s but in time he over-
came that

  he did other things worthy of note

  there was one lemuel spudd whose wife
was a successful gardener and cliicken-
raiser lemuel himself was a pensioner for
three months service having gone as far as
nashville and ruined a magnificent consti-
tution by crossing the ohio river in a fog

  lemuel spent the summer days pitching
horseshoes against all comers and avoiding
hard work on account of bringing on them
suddent dizzy spells

  lemuels reputation extended back into the
far townships when henry the new oper-
ator broke into the game lem toyed with
him and bestowed upon him the usual taunts
and contempt of a champion to a novice but
the new operator had a steady nerve and a
good eye and began pressing lemuel for
honors the sporting blood of the village
was up and the final contest drew the popu-
lation of the place to the spot

  henry broke the worlds record in four
throws he pitched four ringers the best
lemuel had ever done was three  ringers 
and one leaner

  from that day lemuel was a dethroned
idol the laurels of the horseshoe champion-
ship were transferred to the new operator

  for a long time lemuel was sour and sore
and remained at home with an alleged attack
of the old army complaint

  then henry edged into the game of cro-
quet that for seasons had been monopolized
by gene steele jim mock and zac sample
in a short time he got so he could plunk
them across the lot with deadly aim squeeze
through wickets on the narrowest margins
and place the balls like magic the old vet-
erans quarreled with him complained of
his manner of play and found fault with his
maneuvers and technique but one by one
henry vanquished them all and became the
village champion

  then he stood up chesty and defiant and
searched the horizon with an alexandrian
eye

  he spotted sycamore corner a near-by vil-
lage triumphant and boasting over its base-
ball club henry organized the spartans to
give battle

  he gathered recruits from the general store

lemuel spent the summer days pitching horseshoes against
all comers and avoiding hard jvork on account of
bringing on them suddent dizzy spells

the railroad mans magazine

the blacksmith shop and the farms feeling
ran high sycamore corner sent over word
that they were calmly waiting but what they
would do to sulphur springs would be a
sufficiency

  henry was captain and catcher

  sycamore corner won the first game easily
but the second went to sulphur springs the
third and deciding contest took place on the
fourth of july

  henrys husky aggregation was clad in
overalls some of them were barefooted
the reputation of their native village was
at stake the sneers of triumph and the
haughty contempt of the enemy rankled in
every bosom sycamore corner must be
humiliated

  humankind is much alike now then and
everywhere the wildest  bug  of cub-
ville or giant town has nothing in way of
partisan intensity and effusive or abusive
boisterousness not possessed by the militant
followers of those two village nines in that
far-away day

  the game itself was one of those magnifi-
cent cross-road exhibitions of the national
sport

  there were a few fights on the line by the
over-zealous and ultra-enthusiastic which
added spice to the afternoons entertainment
but in no way affected the issue

  the last half of the last inning found
sulphur springs at bat with the score of
 to  in favor of sycamore corner

 two men were out but the bases were
 filled

henry came to bat	f

 the cries and shrieks of howling dervishes
 filled the air and while the enemy bellowed
 in derision henry missed two good ones and
 the umpire bawled out above the din

 two strikes

 then henry showed his metal he arose
 to the occasion in the crisis and pinch he
 steadied and the next instant there was the
 sharp crack of the bat and the ball sailed off
 until it faded away in the distant haze of
 the summer day

 henry went the circuit with three ahead of
 him and sulphur springs had won-
 to 

 thus in sport triumphant henry arose to
 the highest possible distinction in his native
 town

 the next day he scrubbed out the depot
 it is only the truly great that can lay aside
 the laurel wreath at the very hour of triumph
 and return to the humble duties of life

 	lemuel spudd nosed about

  goin to be an inspection he asked

  why do you want to know   replied
 henry

  i see youre scrubbin out thats a purty
 good sign the big fellers air a cornin along

 well if they do come said henry you
 make yourself scarce if they want to ask
 you about anything ill send for you

 spudd grinned in a silly manner and edged

 only the truly
great can lay aside
the laurel wreath
at the very hour
of triumph and re-
turn to the hum-
ble duties of life

lem heard the superintendent tell henry that he had grown some

away a little but
beat no full retreat

  the entire popu-
lation of a small
town always consider
the scrubbing of the
depot the sign of an
official visit next
day every one lays
close and holds him-
self in readiness

  a strange whistle
or an engine with a
single coach brings
to the depot a swarm
of the nibby and
the idle curious that
hang around the edge
and intrude with an
ignorant impudence

  they want to hear
every word they
hope the superin-
tendent will crush
and humiliate the
agent they are
eager for something
to sizzle and they
do not want to miss
any of it

  you may be sure
an agent is delight-
ed to be surround-
ed by a delegation of his fellow - townsmen
on these occasions not so much that they
are often barefooted bareheaded and wonder-
eyed or that he needs the moral support of
great numbers but that they take such a
keen interest in the affairs of his office and
lend a certain yokel color to the perspective
so that the passing official instinctively places
the agent as one of them

  in the winter henry organized the sul-
phur springs cornet band-twenty members

  by spring they could play no  a
certain waltz and the palms

  they may not have had the elegance and
finish of arthur pryor or the stirring ca-
dence of john philip sousa but believe me
they sure did make the noise

  henry played the tuba he could send the
hoarse notes reverberating half - way out
home and back he had six-cylinder s-
h-p lungs and a reserve force not men-
tioned in the catalogue

  so much for horseback-riding country but-
termilk baseball and tuba-playing he was
being developed into a lil artha john-
son

   if any reader has grown impatient and
fretful following the byways of this narra-
tive to know wherein there is anything about
this country-station experience suggesting a
fitness or in any way preparatory to the
highest duties in railroading he now has the
answer

  ordinarily a young man removed from
the direct observation of the general officers
and stationed at some isolated spot or on
some detached duty must do something very
much out of the ordinary showing heroism
presence of mind or some unusual aptitude
to call attention to himself or he is forgot-
ten

  one day lemuel spudd obeying an un-
erring instinct hustled to the depot just as
the superintendents special pulled in

  lem did not want to miss a word that
passed but he wanted fb absorb it all cas-
ually and unconcernedly he armed himself
with a long pine stick and a sharp knife
and commenced whittling in an aimless and
preoccupied manner and edged in

   lem heard the superintendent tell henry
that he had grown some since he had come


the railroad mans magazine

to sulphur springs the surroundings must
agree with him

  lem heard the superintendent tell henry
something in return but the only word he was
certain of was-buttermilk

  lem crowded a little closer and was dis-
gusted to note that the superintendent was
pleased and that he asked henry about
buttermilk and narrated some butter-
milk experience of former days

  this kind of talk did not please lem he
wanted to hear henry criticized and chas-
tised so he could hurry over to the black-
smith-shop and the general-store and spread
the news that  henry had got his

  in a spasm of disappointment lem began

   that fellows a loafer he explained
 it made me mad the way he tried to butt
in and the way he was littering up this
place i-

   not a word said the superintendent
greatly pleased dont forget that jug and
the special moved on

  a few days later henry sent in a gallon
jug of fresh spring - cooled buttermilk
tagged to the superintendent

  it was the real old - fashioned article-

if

j-nor-mah lsmr

henry obeyed a lightning impulse

whittling more desperately long shavings
fell thick and fast on the cleanly-swept plat-
form and under the officials feet in a sort of
protest against the character of the conversa-
tion

  it all happened in an instant

  henry obeyed a lightning impulse he
grasped the nibby and offending lemuel
by the nape of the neck and by a dexterous
yank and with two or three well-directed
kicks he landed him clear of the premises

  the next minute henry tried to apologize
to the superintendent

neither overripe nor underdone-uncontami-
nated by butter coloring preservative or re-
frigerator taints

  it called for more

  one day a strange package accompanied
the jug it was a country ham

  when a man is offended for years by the
saltpeter the liquid smoke and the forced
chemical curing of the packing-house prod-
uct a country ham is like manna from heaven

  a country ham is not an article of com-
merce and when one finds its way to the
larder of a city man it is either because he
observations of a country station-agent



has found the combination or because  allah
is good for the country ham is where the
shote is picked in the very pink where the
corn flavor is accentuated by the mild smoke
of real hickory bark where it is hand-
rubbed and cured without forcing-and
where the order always repeats  thank you
for a little more

  for a long time there had been mm
trouble in the yards at night the road
found it difficult to get a competent man to
handle the situation which required the qual-
ities of quick decision some nerve and char-
acter

  the superintendent decided on some
changes he reached for henry

  he took him without experience or train-
ing and put him in the yard henry learned
the game and made good from that point
he went on and up until he became the great-

est of mazookums with  rings on his fingers
and bells on his toes

  now the point  am struggling to is this
why should the biography of this great rail-
roader lay emphasis on the commencement of
henrys career as a station-agent in a coun-
try village what has that got to do with
the case 

  why not start the biography this way
while employed in an humble position
he passed the buttermilk along and at the
psychological moment lie administered three
swift kicks to one lemuel spudd an in-
truder

  honest now what caused the superintend-
ent to call on the agent at sulphur springs to
take a fighting job and which gave henry
his opportunity

  a true biographer should not overlook
trifles

old chris adelman

an alton veteran whose name has stood for faithfulness and efficiency

for nearly half a century

by s h brown

hris adelman is the oldest
road engineer in point of service
on the chicago and alton in-
cidentally his running-mate at
the other end of the  slater ac-
commodation out of kansas
city-known everywhere as the  red hum-
mer-is john g alexander the youngest
conductor on the western division

  in the truest sense of the word such men
as adelman are representative americans for
they are built of those steadfast calm compe-
tent qualities that have made this country
what it is a typical american adelman is
also a typical product of that vast railroad in-
dustry which americans have done more than
any other people to develop on gigantic pic-
turesque lines

  adelman has been in the employ of the
chicago and alton for forty-six years and
if confidence competence and activity count
for anything he is still a young man though
years and experience have put their marks on
his hair and face

chris adelman


the railroad mans magazine

   he joined the road as a brakeman in 
in the stirring times of the civil war two
years later he was promoted to fireman and
in  he went to the right side of a freight-
engine ten years later he was promoted to a
passenger-engine so that for nearly thirty
years he has borne the chief responsibility for
many hundreds of lives

   in s the alton secured its first entry
over its own line into kansas city and adel-
man pulled the first regular alton train into
the budding metropolis-a train of nine cars
including a diner hauled by engine no 
weighing thirty-four tons

   one of the chief characteristics of the fa-
mous veteran is his dry humor always kindly
but always to the point and it is common
belief that he has brought more firemen to a
realizing sense of what he expected of them
with half a dozen words than most engineers
have done with the most accomplished and
unsacred vocabulary at their command

   on one trip the green fireman that he had
was a most enthusiastic shoveler the sound
of the popping valve seemed to be music to
him and when the injectors were working
overtime he was happy the value of coal
was a thing unheard of by him and the only
place he liked to see it was in the fire-box
so he did his best to put the whole tender-load
of it there as quickly as possible

   at last the engineer became impatient the
indicator showed top pressure and they were
bowling along finely when another burst of
industry seized the fireman and grabbing his
shovel he was about to swing a scoopful onto
the fire when adelmans voice came to him

    say if you dont like to see that coal
throw some of it out of the gangway

   a different case was that of the fireman
who thought that the duty of making steam
was quite secondary to an artistic apprecia-
tion of the landscape they were in the mid-
dle of a run and the fireman had just climbed
on his box-seat and with a far-away look in
his soulful eyes was admiring the beauteous
scenery

   the indicator hovered hesitatingly at twen-
ty pounds under  pop and showed a down-
ward tendency in other words the engine
was technically cold suddenly the fire-

man came back to earth and with a praise-
worthy desire to be helpful he drew in his
head and shouted

   say chris theres somethin poundin
down there

   so   queried the engineer  guess it
must be icicles

  just as much to the point was his remark
to a fireman of the same school who having
displayed no living interest in his fire after
leaving kansas city until they were approach-
ing the grade for independence was aroused
from his reverie by adelmans voice in-
quiring

   ive been working twenty minutes now
when do you expect to begin   he began

  but not all the stories of adelman are
humorous there have been times in his
railroad career when the man of steel has
shown up back of that every-day faithfulness
and when death and duty have ridden side
by side on bright rails smeared with blood

  one such occasion was when owing to
the carelessness of a brakeman a siding-
switch had been left closed and adelmans
engine crashed down the siding into a stand-
ing freight at larrabee larrabee was a
blind-siding and adelman was not required
to either stop or slow down

  the crash was terrific the fireman of the
passenger-train was burned almost to a cinder
in his own fire the men in the freight-en-
gine were instantly killed a number of pas-
sengers were injured and the engines were
locked in one solid mass of twisted rods and
plates

  adelman was thrown many feet and when
he was unearthed from a mass of debris one
leg was broken in three places and he was
battered and bruised all over and then with
his strength fast ebbing in the agony of his
hurts he gasped feebly fv

   look after the others im all right
there is no melodrama there there is no
mere copy for a sensational newspaper re-
port there is an actual man with torn
burned flesh and broken limbs suffering to
the point of death more agony than death as
he gasps

   look after the others im all right

   yes hes all right
an hour in the pit

      by robert fulkerson hoffman

        dan lamy sees the beauty of railroading
        but he once longed for something safer

 	ood morning brother good

  xl a morning i hope you are re-
  g skemj joicing in the beautiful up-
  mwmffimt	this delightful morn-

               ing these glorious mountains
this matchless blue sky this
sweet stirring air they make our task in
life a beautiful one do they not

  dan lamy was not rejoicing in the uplift
to any noticeable degree just at the moment
but he was very far from sad he had ac-
quired a wholesome sort of philosophy that
carried him over the rough places of life with
very little jolt and sometimes enabled him to
hitch his mental go-cart to a passing star
and clamber in for a moment before it spilled
him back to earth again

  so dan reached out between the driving-
wheels of the big locomotive which was shut-
ting out his view of the mountains the blue
sky and much of the sweet stirring air
caught the low slanting main-rod with his
good right hand and dragged himself out on
his back from beneath the engine where he
had been silently working

  then while his inverted upturned face
looked up into the friendly and enthusiastic
face of the young minister who had spoken
dan answered

  yes sir ill allow they do-but ive
seen the day when id have traded for some-
thing safer theres times when a fellow
feels like bendy striker said that day  for
a nice safe clean job gi me preachin 

  he turned over on the ground with that
and rose stiffly to his feet between the purr-
ing bulk of the waiting engine and the eager
upstanding figure of the young minister

  the sweet sharp air swept down from
the sun-tipped crest of pelaya mountain
rippling and wimpling the new - range
grasses upon the nearer slopes it toyed
familiarly with the long frock of the young

ministers coat and waved it like a banner
from his stalwart legs it sent the little col-
umn of smoke swirling and doubling upward
in restless curlings from the locomotives
stack and it caught up gently lamys empty
blue blouse sleeve and waved it as in a mute
belated farewell to the good left arm that
was gone

  the call of destiny had brought the young
minister from his distant home on the plains
newly to tend the little flock of pelaya
filled with a boundless enthusiasm for his
work in a world which he had thus far found
a smiling place he had come rejoicing in his-
own perfect physical being and in a rathe-
broad view of the surface indications of ijife
as he saw it

  he soon discovered an unsuspected dtvpth
beneath the every-day manifestations of pe-
layas methodical virile life he had con-
fessed to himself in the quiet of his modest
study that there were times when he had felt
much as if he were an overeager puppy
caught tugging futilely at the free end of a
very deep and firm root

  therefore being a man of sound judg-
ment and right thinking he had started out
upon the premise that a good shepherd must
follow his flock to the field no less than cud-
dle it in the field

  the call of the dispatcher-which is the
frequent call of destiny for men who follow
the rail-had brought the hard-run express
engine from its stall in the roundhouse to the
cross-over track at the station too hurriedly
for the completion of dan lamys regular
routine

  dan had followed and so it had come
about that the minister met an unknown
member of his newly acquired flock and dan
lamy met the new minister whom he had
not previously seen

  just for the moment the young man of the


the railroad mans magazine

 cloth regarded dans impassive face narrow-
 ly while the suspicion that he was being
 laughed at brought a flush to his face but
 when lamys far gaze came back from the
 gold and white of the mountain-top across
 the swelling green of the slopes and finally
 to the busy shops and the waiting engine
 before him his faded blue eyes looked
 squarely into the sparkling black eyes of the
 minister and he said

    yes sir its certainly fine to have a
 part in all this 

    yes glorious  said the minister

   each knew that the other had arrived on
 a mutual ground of respect

    and striker said the minister easily
 he was your fireman you are the engi-
 neer of this great machine

     who me   asked lamy

   in turn he had suddenly come to ques-
 tion whether he was not being laughed at by
 this self-poised stranger but one searching
 look dispelled the doubt he answered
 oh no im only a wiper they took
 her away from me in the roundhouse for a
 special thats coming i have to finish her
 here no he continued as he resumed his
 wiping of the under parts  im no engi-
 neer i was meaning to be once a while
 mjack but after i lost the arm-why that
 ay as all off you know being an engineer
 i hiean he explained with painful exact-
 ness

   no bendy striker was a machinist on
 the jiits in the backshop that time when he
 madfe them remarks about preachin and that
 i ws his helper and we were working on
 this -same engine i reckon shes been rebuilt
 or overhauled two or three times since then
 for heavy repairs seems to get betfer every
 time too bendy strikers improved a lot
 likewise hes roundhouse foreman over
 there now there he goes now just cross-
 ing the turn-table see him said lamy in
 keen excitement

    he watched furtively between the tops of
 the engine frames and the belly of the boiler
 until a stalwart figure of a man had stalked
 into the open end door of the roundhouse and
 disappeared

   oh hes a keen one laughed lamy
 as he resumed his puttering with a wisp of
 cotton-waste

   there aint no better hes watching
 me and hell give me holy sailors if i dont
 get this engine done in time bendy wants
 everything looking its best and he gets it
 you bet

    but the backshops the place dan an-

 nounced with a wise shake of the head as he
 attacked his wiping with zeal renewed

    ever been over there   lie asked with an
earnest upward glance while he picked up
his kit and moved to the next driving-wheel
ahead

  no but i have been intending to go re-
plied the minister following lamys lead

    youll see the big cranes lifting and car-
rying the engines like children in arms and
youll see other things as fine and wonderful

  but me i always go and have a look
at the old drop - table where we took the
wheels out of them and put them in again
in the days when i was helping bendy

  you see how its done youve stripped
your engine and took the wheels out of her
long before well say the boys have been
swarming over her on the erecting pit for a
month like bees storing honey in a dead
mountain-tree

   then comes a day when shes all snug
and proud and shining with blue jacket and
paint but shes still setting squat on her
blocking like a duck froze fast in the ice
you jack her up a bit at the front and run
in her truck you lift her a bit at the rear
and slip a dummy pair of wheels under her

   the big doors swing open at the head of
the pit the cable of the transfer hooks onto
her and she moves out slowly like the bright
sun had thawed that duck out of the ice and
shes trying her legs for a start

   the transfer snorts and grinds along
with her setting all quiet aboard until she
stops and begins moving backward onto the
drop-table-say three pits farther along in
the shop again

  and there you are shes standing with
her front track blocked on the solid rails at
the head of the drop-table and her make-
believe dummy pair standing far in on the
drop-table behind her stands the boys all
ready and anxious with her three pairs of
big new-turned driving-wheels and fresh-
fitted boxes hanging on the axles

   do you see   queried lamy anxiously

    i see said the minister quietly

    then you haul out the two big fork-head-
ed ratchet-jacks - one on each edge of the
drop-pit-and set them solid and good you
lift the big steel crossgirder and drop it into
the forks of the jackheads and slip the big
girder and all ahead till its under her deck
iron

   you swing to on the jack- evers till she
rests heavy on the cross-girder you yank
out from under her the dummy pair and roll
them clear away -
ip

   there she stands big as a house and
bridged all clear and free above the drop-
table

     you see  

     i see said the minister

    all well you say continued dan proud-
ly and somebody waves a hand somebody
throws the big lever and the drop - table
starts sinking down upon the gears and
screws under the floor with it go the boys
and the new drivers you see because you
must be there to steer the boxes into the
pedestals when she comes creeping up again

    me and bendy had the back pair on this
day im telling you about it was just like
every other such day until die table had got
low enough to let the drivers roll under the
girder two pairs had been rolled ahead
and the boys were stooping and blocking
them with bits of wood to keep them from
rolling back

    bendy and me were just sighting our pair
for its place on the rails-ahead a little and
then back a little-while we kept looking up
at the black tons of her hanging on the girder
about eleven feet above us

    bendys always set great store by sunday
and his family and i guess his minds kind
of running on it then - that being a sat-
urday morning anyway while were rolling
and wedging below and sighting and peer-
ing up into the half-dark above bendys a
singing a little piece that i never forgot and
likely never will it went

   then gather the fam-bly round you sunday
        morn-ing

    let the ba-bies roll a-rouncl upon the flo-or

    kind of jerky and laughing-like it went
that way with bendy prying and straining
at the wheels

    bu-ut i give to you the time-ly warn-ing

   you must ne-ver-

    then it came

    all sudden it was with a sharp snap like
the breaking of a big dry limb in the wind

   one of the ratchet-jacks broke off short
in the thread just above the jack-body the
girder end struck a clip of fire off the broken
jack-head with the engine toppling down
close after the girder skidded forward and
tore out another streak of fire from the steel
rim of the drop-pit then it cleared the edge
all in a wink with the engine falling close
after -

    the rear of her came crashing down com-
plete into the pit with bendy stooping and
singing as i say by our pair

       rr



   i hit him a cruel hard punch back of
die ear-twas all id time to think or do-
and knocked him half under die driving-axle
of our pair he fell in the midst of his
song and his legs stretched out to the wall
of the pit beyond die shelter of the wheel

    down she crashed with a dust of bricks
and mortar from the ripped pit walls and the
shivering noise of her was close and loud
as a thunderclap in may on pelavas top

    she shivered her grates  the rim of our
wheel pair and sent die pieces raining down
around us she cupped her empty fire-box
down over the wheel till it bent the axle and
drove the wheels splintering off the rails and
sunk them in the floor of die table

    then it all got quiet as death we heard
the running feet only of hundreds in the
shop above bendy laid there all quiet and
i laid still beside him for a while sort of
thinking at it my arm felt numblike and
there wasnt anything to do-anyhow not
just dien

    the pit was plugged complete from above 
with the engine crumpled down on us at the
rear and die rest of the boys trapped in the
free space ahead they were safe enough
for the while but me and bendys in a bad
fix

   they began shouting are we hurt and
everybody begins hollering from above are
we hurt

    i answered as best i could said lamy
as he picked up his kit and rounded the pilot
into the bright sunshine on the other side

   yes said the minister as he followed

    bendy sort of roused up at that contin-
ued dan  and first thing he does is finish his
singing

   he sings like hes about half jagged

   ne-ne-ver ta-ke the horse-shoe fr- the
        do-or

    then he lets out a yell that scares me
full alive they said after that you could
hear it clean down to the end of the straight
track through the shop thats a big yell
and he kept it up fighting to tear his legs
loose from the broken plank and iron that
was holding him me up and battling to hold
him down for fear hed bleed too free the
rest of them from above tearing things away
and rigging a derrick to set us free

    i thought i was there a week-they say it
was only an hour-with bendy yelling and
fighting and singing before my strength went
and i called to them that i couldnt hold his
busted leg shut no longer  they must come
help hold him i yelled

an hour in the pit


the railroad mans magazine

    the road doctor got there by then and he
come sliding down the ladder theyd set far
as he could with his little black box in his-
hand

  but he couldnt get to us nope just
scrooched down close among the twisted mess
and peeked in first

  then he hollered at bendy

  hey striker now you lie quiet
cuddle down now or ill come in there
and- do you hear bendy  he says as
savage as anything but of course i knew he
couldnt get in

  and bendy takes a wild look at him
through the engine-frame and quiets down
like a lamb just bleating away dull at
that song again

  with that the doctor tells me to hunt
out bendys pulse and keep hold of it

  now count it when i raise my hand
he says  and keep on a counting till i say

 there

  he takes out his watch and when im all
ready and bendys a-singing peaceable he
jerks up his hand and says  count 

    i go to counting to myself till he says
there 

  eighty says i and he pockets his
watch satisfied

  then he hollers up to them to bring him
a dipper of water pretty soon he shoves in
to me through the mess of bars and stuff a
little shiny squirt with a drop of water hang-
ing on the end of it and he whispers

  jab that into the skin along his back
and push the stopper 

    i did bendy let out a terrible yell and
i had hard wrestling for mebbe half a min-
ute again then he began to quiet down
and in a second more he seems to get clearer
in his mind he raises his head and says
hallo dan what are we waiting on
why dont she go up 

     thats all right bendy  says the doc-
tor before i can answer any

  well run her up in a minute youre
all right-and a good job its no worse  he
adds mebbe louder than he intended

anyway bendy seems to hear it all and
he says just before he went to sleep and
not being altogether clear in his head
yes this jobs all right but for a
nice-clean-safe job-gi me-preachin

  and says i without thinking much
 me too bendy 

   bendys always held that i done him
proud that day but i guess most anybody
would have done as much wouldnt they

  oh yes they got us out all right after
a while bendy always wanted that i should
go on and finish learning the trade with

lamy as he advanced his box-seat to the
rear driving wheel and looked with satis-
faction at that last item in his task

  selling asked the brother

thoughtfully  i have been engaged in giv-
ing away some things which i thought were
of great value now i hope i may be able
to offer a better quality soon

fullness of candor and friendliness

he reached for dans lone hand and closed
upon it with a strong and -honest clasp

sured him with evident anxiety

ling face of the man who was bearing down
upon them from across the tracks

lamy turning for a brief glance

chapter vii

the old gray wolf again

everal weeks after he had settled
down into the routine of bunk and
bars tin plate and bare-board ta-
ble and had assumed his allotted
work as an operator in the prison
telephone-exchange dill came to
see him stone and barnard had
both visited him the sunday before and had
as fully as the limited time permitted gone
over the case with him outlining also a plan
they had to present a petition to the board
of pardons and the governor

  graham had only smiled and shaken his
head for already he had come to realize
even more fully than they the prime mover
in every such affair-pull they had left
him calm and quiet even cheerful as though
dominated by some strange far thought
frankly neither of them had quite under-
stood him and what we cannot understand
is apt to make us a bit uneasy they had
gone away discouraged

  at dills appearance in the outer office
that may afternoon authority scraped and
bowed not every day did a long buff tour-
ing-car roll up over the cobbles from citv

square and stop in chapman street before
the harsh granite-and-steel monument of ugli-
ness that serves the commonwealth as a trap
to hold those foolish or weak enough to be
caught the prison felt itself honored by
that car and by the eminent philanthropist
who had written more than one article on
how shall we treat our unfortunates

  the trusty in charge of the office - a
 lifer  who owed his special privileges to
years of consistent spying and  pigging  on
his fellow captives-hastened to dip pen in
ink for dill to sign the register and then to
creak back the door leading into the corri-
dor which gives access to the rotunda

  dill precise and smiling holding his top
hat over his broadclothed arm stepped out
into the great round stone-paved place from
which on all sides radiate the wings all
about it from floor to roof a matter of forty
or fifty feet rises a huge circle of steel bars
and in the center whence all the tiers of
cells story upon story can be plainly seen
stands the watchmans desk

  a monster cage the rotunda with an eye
at the exact middle-a spider-web with a
spider ever keen-sighted for any move of the
sad gray flies caught in its spreading meshes

  dill nodded familiarly to the watchman
who bowed servilely to him

began in the october railroad mans magazine single copies  cents




the railroad mans magazine

   number twenty-seven hundred and
 four queried the visitor

    the guard consulted a book called a ward-
 er and sent him for the man who now 
 longer had a name but merely three figures
 and a zero to express his personality

   will yez take a seat sir asked he
 pointing at the circle of plain wooden chairs
 that surrounded die rotunda

    dill dianked him but remained standing
 he walked slowly about the space blinking
 up with a show of interest at the ranges of
 cells beyond the cage as a prominent au-
 thority on prison-reform and a writer on the
 problems of how society should best protect
 itself against the lower classes it behooved
 him to simulate observation during this his
 first visit to the penitentiary in over six
 years

   but his real thoughts were far from the
 prison he was remembering still the look
 on grahams face when sentence had been
 imposed-a quiet inscrutable look which had
 often since recurred to his mind-a look
 which had caused him the sensation that all
 of us feel when at the zoo we wonder just
 what might happen if the lions cage door
 should chance to open

    dill had had more than one bad quarter of
 an hour trying to keep that persistent thought
 out of his brain he still looked forward
 to fifteen maybe twenty or more years of
 social prominence public admiration enjoy-
 ment of life perhaps if graham should
 prove embarrassing he might once more be
 put away as easily as the first time perhaps
 not perhaps something might happen dill
 shuddered slightly

    by all means i must-ah-either in-
 timidate the beggar or better still mollify
 him best of all point out to him his only
 chance for rehabilitation-through reform
 eh he concluded with a new sense of self-
 confidence his powers of judgment of
 -word-building of heaping fact on fact of
 buttressing all with impregnable logic had
 he knew few rivals

   once let me talk to him just talk
 thought he and i wager i can change his
 views

    the clang of metal on metal behind him
 brought him round on his rubber heel dill
 always went shod with rubber he loved
 noiseless walking more than once it had
 helped him see things hear things of value
 he faced round two men stood just inside
 the big barred door that led from the cell-
 space into the cage of the rotunda one was
 the-blue-dressed warder the other graham

  for a minute dills eyes narrowed his
heart swelled with almost irrepressible exul-
tation at sight of the young fellow the one-
time menace the potential danger standing
there utterly within the grip of the law
absolutely shorn of power caged crippled in
all his possibilities helpless

  graham remained passive waiting for the
warder to point him out a chair this the
warder did and as dill advanced across the
open space treading as softly as ever a spar-
row-hunting cat stepped he sat down crossed
one gray-clad leg over the other and waited

  dill noted the great change that had come
over him-the close-cropped hair revealing
now the unusual height and depth of skull
the yellowing of the skin which already
showed the beginnings of prison pallor due
to miserable food to lack of exercise sun-
shine and air the thinning out of the cheeks
the neck the corded hands the deepening of
the eye-sockets the singular new light in the
blue eyes

  leaner though graham had become how-
ever dill saw that his shoulders were still
straight and strong and that the throat which
showed through the opening of the coarse
shirt was like a round firm column as it rose
to the close-shaven prominent chin even
the fact that the prisoners nails were care-
fully trimmed and cared for did not escape
dills eye as he drew near and sat down by
graham in the chair which the warder drew
into place for him

  a minute the two men looked at each
other no word was spoken on either side
dill blinked and fumbled at his glasses while
grahams gaze was level and as steady as
steel the lawyer disconcerted set his tall
hat down on the pavement blew his nose
with a flourish and cleared his throat

   my-all-my young friend he began
then stopped short there was something
in grahams look that he instinctively felt
made that line of approach useful perhaps
in other cases quite too baldly absurd
dill sniffed fingered his watch-fob and tried
again the warder with a curious glance
moved away

  you might as well know said dill
positively faced down by grahams silence
and the steady searching eyes know-ah
-that-that is you understand i have felt
it my duty to come out here this afternoon
at considerable loss of time and trouble to
-to see you

  duty ah a great word duty we all
have a duty to perform to our fellow man
even to the most misguided the most erring
the steeled conscience



a duty to society a duty to our neighbor
the unfortunate circumstances leading up to
-to your present situation were-hm-m-m
-were forced upon you-upon me i mean
upon me were forced upon me in a manner
which i need not rehearse here

   how much i regret them all only my
maker knows he-ah-reads every heart
and searches every soul i trust that you
will prove penitent and-and truly chastened
and that this retirement from the world will
give you ample time to reconsider your ways
to take counsel with your inner self to
grow in patience and humility to reform
radically and truly reform so that when you
-that isso that there will never be any
further cause to - ah - i hope you under-
stand me  

   he paused a little out of breath and with
his fine linen handkerchief nervously dabbed
at his forehead his hope was that graham
would make some answer come out with
some request softie reproach best of all some
threat for then he felt he could immedi-
ately take the whip-hand of the situation
once he could get a man to talking to argu-
ing he knew how deftly he-could entangle
him how cleverly put him in the wrong

  many and many a client betrayed and
plundered he had dealt with thus in jail or
out but now he seemed to feel a force differ-
ent from anything he had ever known su-
perior to his baffling redoubtable

  the sweat started in reality though the
prison air was chilly and dank he shifted
his feet uneasily and sat there a moment
almost forgetting what he had come there to
say unable to lay tongue to a word a cell
door jarred and grated rough-shod feet
clattered somewherfe on iron a footstep
sounded oil the rotunda

  dill looked up another visitor had en-
tered-a sturdy big-chested man with a face
lined by suffering with eyes which had been
dimmed by the bitterest tears in this sad
world the tears of parenthood the visitor
sat down a few chairs distant and waited
dill revived to action began again

    coming down to practical fact said he
lowering his voice and leaning a bit nearer to
graham  you must realize how terribly this
unfortunate affair has broken me to be
forced actually forced-ah-to take action
against a former ward of mine against the
son of an old friend-i trust you grasp my
meaning

    the situation is quite intolerable now
my boy i have decided to leave the city
the country in fact to retire from prac-

tise for a while permanently it may be
to take my-er-my daughter you under-
stand and go abroad where i can secure for
her cultural and matrimonial prospects far
superior to any in america very agreeable
climate and conditions of life you know on
the riviera cannes or nice or some one
of the towns along the mediterranean will
no doubt suit us exactly

    orange-groves olive-orchards sea-bath-
ing social amenities and all that rather a
contrast eh with this he added an un-
dertone of bitter malice running through his
voice like the red thread in british naval
rope hidden yet real

  bless my soul what a contrast the
way of the transgressor is hard my boy vir-
tue is-is-ahem as i was saying he
hurried on lowering his eyes before the silent
cynical look of graham as i was about to
remark undoubtedly my daughter will be
materially benefited by residence abroad

    the painful memories of this affair will
be soon obliterated she has been much dis-
tressed-er-that is she was at first but-
after all the facts came out-not from me
you understand not from me but in the
public press then she seemed to become more
reconciled much more so yes indeed
to forget entirely so i-we-ah-that
is a trip abroad will doubtless effect a com-
plete change in her sentiments i trust you
comprehend me fully and make up your
inind to relinquish all-that is to say-

  he stopped again though graham had
not spoken yet something had come into the
young mans face an expression a gleam of
light in his eyes that dill knew spelled
danger pie had seen somewhat that look on
the night when graham had first confronted
him with the diary wisely he desisted

    in conclusion he went on leaning over
and picking up his hat which he carefully
dusted on his sleeve  in conclusion let me
say only two things one is that the-the
bonds you understand-the bonds you were
so imprudent as to lay claim to have been
put ih a safe plce positively secure you
know

   so also the-ah-evidence which you
seem to think you had rather an interest-
ing souvenir for me more-prudent i think
to leave such things than to carry them
abroad so when you are at liberty again
do not i pray you be so foolish as to take
a long trip for absolutely nothing for
positively nothing nothing in any way

   i feel confident that a young man of
your intelligence and doubtlessly fundamen-


the railroad marts magazine

tal good sense will grasp ray meaning and
act accordingly nothing can ever be gained
by trying to see either myself or my daughter
again a lock-box in a-a lock-box you
know is sometimes most convenient

  graham did not move nor speak but sat
listening simply because listen he must dill
stood up and pulled his overcoat around
his stooping shoulders

   one word and then i must-ah-really
i must go you know said he glancing up
at the prison clock your sentence is in-
determinate everything rests with you
good conduct and a sincere desire for reform
will shorten this time of necessary discipline
the reverse will lengthen it

  after it is over i trust you will resume
your former occupation and-hm-m-m-
succeed any second offense you know-

   he paused interrupted by the entrance into
the rotunda of another prisoner-a mere boy
not over eighteen years old graham for
the first time since dill had begun talking
took his eyes from the lawyers face to look
up he already knew the boys story-a
hold-up escapade construed as highway rob-
bery with a ten-year sentence

   the other visitor the stout man was stand-
ing there with arms wide open tears gushing
down his face into his arms staggered the
boy ghastly white he had been in prison
only a week and had not yet learned to steel
himself against it he flung himself upon
his fathers breast sobbing and the father
bending his head took the boys face in both
his hands and kissed him it was all quite
irregular the warden had to intervene

   dill profiting by the diversion and having
said all that he had come to say decided he
had better not linger to dole out the moral
maxims he had been planning to conclude
with glad of the chance to get away he
noiselessly crossed the floor tapped at the
wicket and was let out

  two minutes later he was in the big buff
motor which with a growl of gears started
on its swift course toward boston and num-
ber  had been led back to his place in
the prison exchange

  all the way over the charlestown bridge
dill was thinking hard

    didnt say a word he reflected poison-
ously angered by his failure to draw gra-
hams fire or to impress him in any way
bitterly humiliated by the memory of gra-
hams cool clear eyes that seemed to look
him through and through  so then hes
stubborn yet damn him well theyll take
that out of him all right just a word from

me to the chief and-theyll break his nerve
safe enough they know how well see
-well see 

  but all the rest of that day that night
and many many days and nights even after
an ocean rolled between him and america he
still saw those eyes still read in them some-
thing that not all his logic or hard common-
sense not all his reasoning not the orange-
groves the silver-glinting southern sea nor
anything on earth could banish from his
fear-stricken brooding mind

chapter viii

first lessons

itumber s cell-mate was a middle-
 aged quiet man somewhat bald with
a pointed little grayish beard which as a
special privilege he was allowed to cultivate
his left eye had a curious cast due to the
fact that a couple of black spots had punc-
tured the gray iris this peculiarity gave
him the appearance of never looking directly
at anybody or anything it caused him a sort
of squinting appearance disconcerting and
ominous yet as a matter of fact no milder-
spoken man existed than he

  during the evening hour when conversa-
tion was occasionally permitted he sometimes
talked a little with  though even then
he usually preferred to read books from the
prison library one after the other he was
an earnest studious fellow and one whose
observations showed a great insight and a
strong grasp of facts he was not expan-
sive in the least but gave  to under-
stand that once his days work was done in
the shop he preferred to follow his own de-
vices he never volunteered his name or
any data as to his crime or sentence and 
did not violate prison ethics by asking him

  the only title given him beside his num-
ber was piano which  inferred was
due to his fine and dexterous fingers he
often wrote a short article or a bit of verse
for the little mentor the penitentiary paper
though quiet he was far from disagreeable
twenty-seven-o-four considered himself
lucky to be bunking with such a man rather
than with some dope-smuggling maunder-
ing cursing brate

  three months or a little more had passed
barnards occasional visits had dwindled to
almost none at all stones weekly letter had
become two-weekly and showed signs of stop-
ping altogether before something happened
that brought piano and switch as his cell-
the steeled conscience



mate had been christened because of his
work closer together that established be-
tween them a bond of personal sympathy
and caused the older man to talk a little
guardedly at such times as talk was tol-
erated

   this is how it came about almost oppo-
 site s seat at the long bare table in
 the whitewashed cavern-like room where
 three times daily the convicts hastily and in
 enforced silence ate their miserable food sat
 the young boy who had been  jobbed  by
 the police on the highway-robbery charge
 the boy knew as well as the authorities did
 that his crushing sentence had been imposed
 simply because a gang of house-prowlers had
 been tearing things wide open in boston of
 late and the police had been obliged to save
 their faces by burying somebody

    he had been that somebody that was all
 this knowledge had made him restive and
 bitter once or twice already he had been
  stood out  for some minor infraction of the
 rules he had already been marked for pun-
 ishment inhuman eyes watched him con-
 tinually

   it was one afternoon at supper that the
 blow fell the boy had been driven hard
 in the shop all that day and had sulked
 his appetite had gone back on him and the
 supper made him downright sick he turned
 away from the piece of punk or bread
 and the tin basin of soup made a wry face
 and in a clearlv audible voice gibed  sky-
  blue

    at the sound of the word which few pris-
 oners would have dared utter in the presence
 of authority a snicker ran along the funer-
 ally-silent table instantly a warder was
 upon the boy hauling him away twenty-
 seven-o-four did not laugh he only sat
 there mad clear through his mouth open as
 though to protest he too was summoned
 for complicity and insubordination along
 with the boy he was made to  dance on the
 carpet

    but  refused to turn accuser he was
 foolish enough to say that the soup was
 thin and that he didnt blame the boy for
 kicking that any word of his should thrust
 the lad into deeper torture was unthinkable
 as a result each of them got twenty-four
 hours in the  cooler  on bread and water

    that first experience with darkness soli-
 tude hunger and a despotism just as auto-
 cratic as that of any czar gave  some
 new thoughts some thoughts such as even
 after all he had gone through he had never
 known the like of

  for the first time now he had come face
to face with an item of the prison code-a
code diametrically opposed to that of honor
a code wherein truth and kindness are crimes
while deception boot-licking and tale-bear-
ing are virtues he returned to his cell and
to his studious mate with his brain stunned
his soul afire

  but  piano  only smiled at him conde-
scendingly almost as though in scorn

  what business of yours after all was it
what they did to him   asked he in a low
voice so as not to be overheard by any one
official or eavesdropper

   you mean that no matter what happens
what rotten injustice is put through-
exactly justice my young innocent
has no meaning in here any more no nor
injustice its power that counts nothing
else just as you found out before you
came oh i know about your case all
right we know these things here my ad-
vice is see nothing hear nothing feel noth-
ing get mum go into a trance as it
were just tick off the days thats all some-
time youll be out and then-therell be
things to do but now forget it dont try
to help anybody you cant and youll get
in bad with the  mugs remember a  stive 
isnt the outside world its a corner of
hades now you know what i mean are
you wise 

  without bothering for an answer piano
took up his book again and by the light of
the incandescent began to read his mate
saw that the volume was past and pres-
ent he wondered why thought he
should a philosopher like this a man who
chose for his companion carlyle be doing a
term in the penitentiary urged by a sud-
den great curiosity he asked

   how in the world do you know all this
and so much more you must have seen
some pretty rough work

   have i  you guess right first thing
what ive seen and heard would fill a book
ten times bigger than that and he held
up the volume of carlyle  oh no im
not going to scare you by telling you too
much no use of it but after youd seen
the third degree worked on a helpless quiv-
ering wreck or seen a sick man tortured in
the sweat-box or heard a cell-mate shriek
when they put the  humming - bird  onto
him-

   humming-bird 

  why yes dont you know they
chain a prisoner into a metal tank and then
connect a sponge and a wire with a powerful


the railroad mans magazine

better or dynamo a warder with rubber
gloves on passes the wet sponge over the
naked body of the man till he faints or goes
mad its a lulu 

   impossible 

  piano laughed again nevertheless they
do it he replied  they also give the
water-cure ive had it myself they bound
me in a bath-tub and squirted water down
my throat with a hose till i had all the sen-
sations of drowning and lost consciousness
oh nice

   but after all there are worse things
than those if youd seen as i have a
woman-a woman i say-strung up by the
thumbs and whipped until she fainted or a
girl bound into a whipping-machine and
the machine turned till her blood ran i
reckon maybe youd think a few things but
youd never blow my son not if you un-
derstood what you were up against nay
nay sonny 

   wouldnt i  well i rather guess i
would 

  piano merely shook his head  if you
did he answered  youd get a bigger dose
of the cubby-hole than would be healthy
thats all theyd break you - as theyve
broken so many thousands of others-body
soul and mind and in the end turn you
out a hopeless debased wreck sure to drift
into quod again sooner or later

   ive never known a man to buck the sys-
tem yet and get away with it they kill
without thinking much more of it than you
would of lighting a pipe its brutality sys-
tematized its a force that knows its power
it cant be broken no use no use

  he paused a moment thinking  the
whipping-machine he resumed had
leather straps by the way straps with iron
rivets set in used in a southern prison
where men are gallant those pens down
there are torture they use a whip in
some of the camps called a  red heifer
about six feet long and notched at the end to
make it bite before they flog they dip it in
lime-water to make it heavier every stroke
flicks off the skin and takes out the flesh
oh yes a good many men die from the
effects but whats the difference-when there
are always plenty more
twenty-seven-o-four gasped

  do you mean to tell me that in the
lnited states-that in a free country-
piano smiled ever see the bull-
rings asked he no they also call em
the  strappadoes  and the  hook theyre
used for hanging up men by the wrists like

beef carcasses and letting em swing how
long oh one day maybe maybe seven
or eight just as the warder feels about it
great i-stitution

   i knew about a chap named william
hamlin nineteen years old out at the pon-
tiac reformatory thats in illinois you
know they strung him up for thirty-eight
hours william wasnt very husky i guess

it killed him spine was broken in two
places oh yes you can find it in the rec-
ords if you ever care to look for it

  pianos mate stood up suddenly and began
pacing the cell

   one little case i remember continued
pianothat may interest you as showing
how many rights youve got now it hap-
pened in the jail at erie pennsylvania
well

   one of the boys kept insisting on his
rights as a citizen same as you seem to think
you can one day two or three of the ward-
ers threw him down a few flights of iron
stairs thats all nearly every rag of clothes
was torn off him and he was bleeding all
over when they chucked him back in his cell

i never thought a man could let out such a
heart-broken yell as he did it was his last
protest he never said anything about hav-
ing any rights after that learned his les-
son you see as a matter of fact a dog has
just as many rights as a prisoner that any
official is bound to respect thats gospel
the young convict started to say something
in a loud and angry voice but piano checked -
him

   s-s-sh  commanded he  dont be a
fool want a touch of the cat yourself

  go on said  fiercely

   i did a  finif  in the rhody pen once
remarked piano reminiscently now i
cant go into many details because thereisnt
much time left to-day but ill give you one
or two little incidents i saw or knew of i
heard of men being kept in foul and rat-
infested cells chained to the doors getting
the gout on two bread-and-water hand-outs
per day

  i saw one lad beaten up with blackjacks
till he was knocked out and bloody and then
given thirty-eight days in the black cells i
saw more than half a dozen laced up in the
strait-jacket thats hell the jacket is if
its placed at all tight it cuts your wind
almost off and displaces your insides so that
quite often youre injured or crippled for life
sometimes it kills i saw men kept in that
infernal thing all the way from one to twelve
hours and i know that sometimes theyre put
the steeled conscience



in for days at a time for what reason
assault on an officer not a bit of it ill
tell you for having talked in the shop or
handed an apple or something brought in by
a friend to some other  con

   then there was another fellow bliss
who used to have epileptic fits once when
he came out of one he found a warder
sticking a needle into him to see whether he
was really sick or just  flickering still an-
other wells died about two hours after they-
took him out of the dark cell one time
potters field and the dissecting-table for his
just a few cases to show you im right and
youre wrong my boy thats all

 but-but-cant anything be done
arent there boards of visitors or-anything
to appeal to  

  piano laughed oh yes he answered
 but just you try appealing and see what
happens ive known floggings to take place
when visitors were actually in the jail of
course there were yells and howls and all
that whats the trouble oh just a
man brought in with the d ts the doctors
are trying to quiet him poor chap 

   an open-and-shut game i tell you noth-
ing doing if the abuse happens to break a
bone or a neck or something why-an acci-
dent has happened thats all or they say
a man has been unfortunately injured while
trying to make his  elegant -his escape you
know here look at this for a sample
will you  

  he reached up to the shelf in the corner
took down the compulsory bible and opened
it inside the back cover a little pocket had
been cleverly fashioned by separating the end-
paper from the cardboard out of this pocket
he slipped a few papers looked them over
selected one and handed it to  the
young convict looked at it

  read that said piano ive always
kept it as rather an interesting sample of
mans humanity to man and one phase of
twentieth-century civilization its good eh  
merciful heavens exclaimed  his
eyes fixed on the yellowed scrap of paper a
clipping from some journal his jaw tight-
ened as he read

 taken to gallows with his
         throat cut

jailers bandage the cut and drag man
limp to execution

    santa ff february  - john conley a
  miner who killed james redding and charles
  purdy at the guadeloupe placers was hanged

  to-day at taos a few hours after being found
  in his cell with his throat cut the wound
  was bandaged limp and almost unconscious
  conley was dragged to the gallows and slipped

chapter ix

a sly bird spreads its wings

ehghteen months lagged past each day
 long as a week each week a month
and every month seemingly a year twenty-
seven-o-four had long ago fallen into the
routine to him the outside world had come
to be a distant memory it seemed to him
he had been always pent in bars walking up
and down iron stairs silently eating miser-
able  chuck  in a cavern with no taste of
anything humanly decent except on holidays
-for the current prison jest was that the in-
mates lived on six square meals a year

  he could scarcely imagine that exercise
could be anything save a wretched mockery
of tag or base-ball in a bricked yard or a
ghastly farce of amateur theatricals chapel
he attended because it was a little break in
the misery a chance to let his voice out in
the hymns-and how the convicts bellowed
them blowing off steam for days and days
of enforced silence but to the service he
never paid much heed he knew the type of
man who preached only too well the type of
lecturers too that sometimes came white-
vested to deliver platitudes some of these
made him think of dill occasionally and at
such times a new light would come into his
dulling eyes

  eighteen months of daily and hourly tor-
ment for a free spirit like his cribbd cab-
ined and confined because of what be-
cause of having asked for justice nothing
more not a moment of the time but burned
the iron in his soul


the railroad mans magazine

  all this time he was learning learning
many tilings learning never to interfere
whatever happened learning to be deaf and
blind and dumb-not to see blows hear
shrieks or answer insults learning to bow
his neck to the yoke learning to submit
for it was useless to resist after all

  he came to know about the dope-traffic in
jail the smuggling and sale to prisoners of
opium and other drugs carried on by trusties
and warders at a huge profit-five dollars
worth of stuff bringing forty or fifty he
came to know how men even in distant parts
of the penitentiary could communicate with
each other by means of ciphers go-betweens
rappings and curious secret codes he
learned how a steel bar may be cut with a
mere silk thread and emery powder

  he began to get an insight into prison
traditions and the uncanny superstitions of
criminals-the charms and talismans that
crooks habitually carry their custom of often
leaving an object at the site of a crime their
formulas and beliefs all the way from a sim-
ple word to the ghastly  hand of glory  and
the  slumber-thumb cut from a corpse and
believed to prevent arrest or make a victim
sleep

  such things and many many many more
scoffed at by the uninformed but vitally real
in the underworld he came to know and
added to his own experience with the law he
piled up endless similar cases about other
convicts he began in short to understand
the truth the cleavage of society into two
sections the precise relation that the law bore
to each

  so the year and a half passed and as
winter settled into spring again he began to
get well into the prison harness to think
prison thoughts live prison life unprotest-
inglv accept without question everything that
happened 

   perhaps the strongest force of all to steady
 however to keep him calm and passive
was the thought that good conduct would
hasten his return to the world of living men
his own experience added to what piano
from time to time told him-as for example
a man getting five years for having stolen a
drink or another being sentenced to seventy-
five days for the theft of seven pennies while
an upper-class theft of a million went un-
punished-such knowledge developed in him
a clear perception of the truth the real char-
acter of modem law he remembered too
a thing piano had once said

  law why my lad laws a net the
big fish break through it the little ones get

hung up by the gills thats all there is to
that

  the thing stuck in his mind he pon-
dered it his keen intelligence gave it un-
equivocal assent all these things and many
another which only a thick book would find
space to describe worked on him constantly
they molded him formed and altered him
not all at once but gradually yet with abso-
lute logic and honesty he shucked off the
conventions of life and assumed the realities
and his pale prison-worn sensitive face
showed now another strength-the strength
that comes from recognition of truth

  more and more despite what he knew now
of pianos real career he came to sympathize
with him to share his views to accept the
wise and shrewd dicta which this singular
man cultured yet fully in touch with the
underworld its life its argot its thought
occasionally let fall and so it was that
more than any other person at the gray old
penitentiary he felt a sense of keen loss of
deprivation when one day piano disap-
peared

  i doubt if the head warden himself re-
gretted that disappearance more than 
when piano was missed at supper when he
was found not to be in his cell or anywhere
about the prison-when by whisperings tap-
pings secret and devious ways the informa-
tion trickled through the sad hive that a
break had been made and a getaway pulled
off  had a hard fight with himself not
to wish the man back again

  half that night he lay turning on his
bunk in the rough blanket feverishly won-
dering what had happened and just how the
thing had been brought to pass marveling
at the nerve and self-restraint of the man
who evidently having planned this move
had never by word or sign or look so much
as hinted it to his closest companion

  his admiration would have been full ten
times keener had he known the truth known
the whole story the long planning the in-
finitude of careful thought and preparation
that had led up to the escape more than
six months before piano had succeeded in
getting a place on the editorial staff of
the mentor he had known when one of
the three editors had been released at the ex-
piration of his sentence for months and
months before even that he had been writing
and sending in items and articles with just
this end in view he had applied for the
vacant post and had got it that had been
the first step

   the mentor you understand that lit-
the steeled conscience



tie gray-covered magazine written edited
mimeographed and circulated inside of the
prison walls exclusively by men who have
 done things as the phrase is has its of-
fice down in a little room on the level of the
yard this room had for a long time attract-
ed piano because of possibilities that his
quick eye had seen there once he could
gain access to that room and could spend un-
interrupted hours there he felt sure of results

  there were he knew three editors-one
to make stencils for the mimeograph one to
handle the machine and help edit one to do
literary work exclusively piano coveted the
job as mimeographer where he could use the
waxed sheets the paper the blue ink and the
machine that job he secured

  he soon learned all there was to learn
his eye practised to take in the whole lay
of an office or a bank at one glance had no
difficulty in estimating every possibility of
the room its walls were of bare stone its
two windows barred of course looked out at
the base of the towering prison-wall its
furniture consisted of three desks the ma-
chine a big filing-cabinet and a few shelves
and drawers to the outsider nothing very
promising there to piano everything

  working on the editions for a month or
two each edition consisting of  sheets
he scraped off a little wax here a little there
until he had accumulated all unnoticed a
ball possibly the size of half an egg this
took a long time but piano had more than
enough-had seven years yet to serve in
effect time was no object

  the wax was easily hidden at the back of
one of the drawers under a pile of old dis-
carded manuscript when enough had been
obtained he smuggled it via the subterran-
ean channels that exist in every prison to an
accomplice whose exercise hours allowed him
access to the iron door separating the eastern
yard from the corridor leading to the front
office after a couple of weeks or so the
wax found its way back to piano on it
was a certain impression piano studied this
and smiled

  confiding in nobody not even the other
two convicts who worked with him but
watching his chances using a minute now
and then when he happened to lie alone in
the office-cell he fashioned a key from a strip
of cast-iron which he detached under the ma
chine where there was not one chance in a
hundred it would ever be missed

  no one could have made such a key from
a wax impression even with a file and all
appliances but an ex-safebreaker and yegg

piano did it with only the tiny screw-driver
that was used for repairing the machine it
took him a long long time but at last it
was done the key hidden where the wax had
been and the wax was crumbled up then
bit by bit thrown into the waste-basket and
so lost to view

  all this time other work had been going
forward one of the steel strips of the mime-
ograph frame unaccountably broke about a
month after piano began his work on the
paper a new one was ordered and put on
the pieces were thrown into a drawer inno-
cently enough there were two of them

  next day two pieces were taken away but
the warder never thought of fitting them to-
gether to see if they made up the total
original length had he done so he would
have found some three inches missing

  that three-inch strip of thin steel stayed
for a few days tucked away under a box
after that with now a bit of labor then a
bit it gradually became a file a file that
piano knew could easily be bound with
string to the blade of the little screw-driver
the screw-driver handle he figured would
be easy to hold and would prove all-around
convenient

  sizing up the situation at last he took
account of stock on his inky fingers

  key all right for that file o k
with what ive done already on the two
middle bars give me half an hour and im
fixed ink blue ink lots of it tubes
full cap-remains to be made plenty of
cardboard paste and paper take things all
together i should say about the middle of
next week would be a good healthy time to
go for a stroll sorry to give up a steady
job as assistant editor on a paper-especially
when times are so hard too-but this spring
weather certainly does make me uneasy
heigh-o he yawned i suppose ive got
to begin earning my own living again be-
fore long

  a step sounded in the corridor and a war-
der peered through the bars of the office-
door but he saw only a studious-looking
inky-handed man in a gray suit wearily
working the frame and the big rubber roller
of the old machine

htwo circumstances piano knew must
fall together before he should dare to
make a break first he had to choose an


the railroad mans magazine

afternoon when he could have at least half
an hour to himself in the basement room
and second that hour must come coincidently
with the presence of old man flynn in the
front office flynn was a superannuated
guard stupid and somewhat short of sight
but still serviceable enough to sit at the
desk and receive visitors

  the front office work of course was never
calculated to bring him into any direct con-
tact with the prisoners piano did not reckon
on having much trouble with the man es-
pecially if the lights had not been turned on
in the hall at the time when he should pass
ihrough it toward the street

  with considerable skill he obtained the
information that flynn was usually on duty
monday wednesday and friday afternoons
from four to six the attempt then must
be made at one of those times piano waited
waiting he used his few free minutes now
and then to good advantage constructing a
close imitation of a warders cap

  the abundance of pasteboard paper
mucilage and cord gave him all needful ma-
terials he fashioned the thing with the
editorial scissors painted it blue and black-
ened the vizor with different colored mime-
ograph inks then lettered the front of it
very cleverly with the gold paint wherewith
on special occasions the editors were wont to
decorate the cover of their magazine when
it was done he surveyed it in private under
a dim light and assured himself that it was
good then he emptied a file-box put the
papers into other boxes hid the cap in the
empty box and stood the box in behind a
row of others on the top shelf

   i guess said he  things will be doing
soon now

  everything ready he one evening took a
copy of the mentor to his cell this copy
he marked here and there with little pin-
prick he then mailed it out to an address
in south boston it passed inspection all
right the recipient studied it carefully and
prepared for action

  for more than three weeks he waited pa-
tiently never by any look or word betray-
ing himself till everything should fall just
right at last his chance came

  it was a rainy april afternoon the twenty-
first of the month all day the clouds had
lowered gray mists had hung over the
city thickened by smoke and steam from the
railway just to west of the prison walls and
by fog drifting up from millers river be-
yond there had been no exercise in the
rain-splashed dreary yard everybody

seemed depressed and irritable the chief
editor his work done had been drafted off
to help in the book-keeping department
piano and the other man had been left alone

it was just after four oclock an inspection
had been made piano knew that the chances
were against anybody else visiting the base-
ment till supper time half an hour later

  now thought he straightening up
from his work and looking his companion
fair in the eyes with his peculiar squint

  tired eh asked the other sighing as
he paused for a moment over the stencil he
was graving

  not half so tired as youll be in about
one minute answered piano  if you so
much as peep now no questions just
put your hands together so-and be quick
im going to tie you up 

  the man gaped at him but pianos words
and look left no room for controversy he
obeyed

  piano lashed him quickly with cord that
had fastened a bale of paper this said
he will keep you from getting a taste of
the dark-hole or the sweat-box ill gag you
so now then all you have to say is that
i strong-armed you and youre safe youll
only have to stay this way a little vyhile i
guess you can stand it with great speed
and skill he triced the man then shoved him
over into a corner made him lie down and
bound his feet

  there you are now he remarked re-
member if you ever snitch-well you
know the man glad enough to help a
fellow-convict after all only winked in sig-
nal of comprehension and lay still

   you  round  on me and ill get you
sure as guns 

  piano gave no further heed to him but
opened a drawer fumbled in the back of it
brought out his steel file and quickly lashed 
it to thescrew-driver then going over to
the window he knelt and began working
away at one of the bars

  at the first stroke the file plowed through
a mixture of wax and dirt that had con-
cealed a cut more than half-way through
the bar piano labored fast and hard in
five minutes he had finished that bar and
had begun on the other which had likewise
been prepared

  a step sounded somewhere outside far
down the hall piano waited listening in-
tently his face was a trifle paler than
usual but calm his eyes were steady the
sound died away again he threw himself
at the filing
the steeled conscience



   both bars now were cut before bending
them inward piano did a very curious thing
he peeled off his coat and trousers threw
them on the stone floor and reached for a
bucket that stood in the corner into this
he emptied the contents of three tubes of
blue ink tubes which he ripped up with the
file and squeezed out almost with a single
gesture he snatched the big benzin bot-
tle from the shelf where he had placed it
after the last clean-up of the machine and
emptied it into the bucket too hastily he
stirred the mass with the scissors the ben-
zin quickly dissolved the thick pasty ink
there resulted a large quantity of thin blue
liquid

   into this liquid he threw the trousers sop-
ped them up and down turned them dipped
them he drew them out and wrung them
from dark grey they had become dark blue

   the coat he treated likewise there was
hardly enough liquid left he swabbed the
coat round and round spreading the color
he held it up and surveyed it

   rough work said he judicially but
itll have to do on a pinch after the rain
wets me down i guess the general effect will
pass its got to but fill just take these
along anyhow in case of trouble and he
slipped the scissors into his pocket

   it took him hardly a minute to dress and
soon he stood in the office-cell clad from
head to foot in wrinkled blue clothes

   lucky there is lots of rain this pm
he added- then lie set the cap on his head
ran over to the desk took the key that he
had made and pocketed it

  mum you he commanded turning to
the tied-up convict on the floor  you know
how long a boxmans memory is 

   a moment he stood listening came a far
stroke on a gong followed by the faint slam-
ming of a door

   works over said he theyll be at
supper now couldnt be a finer time  he
paused as though he had forgotten some-
thing  hm-m  he added then he drew
the scissors from his wet pocket and with
two or three firm cuts squared off his pointed
beard  i guess that will help some he
concluded

   over to the window tie stepped seized
first one bar then the other and with a re-
markable display of strength bent them
hauled them inward twisted them aside he
snatched a mucilage-pot from the desk
-poured a handful of mucilage into his palm
and smeared it quickly over the large pane
of glass then picking up a sheet of news-

paper he pressed it against the gummed
window

  one sharp blow with the scissors handle
the glass broke but held by the paper did
not fall jingling to the bricks outside as it
would otherwise have done piano deftly
enlarged the hole in less than two min-
utes lie had broken the pane almost entirely
out and had laid the pieces of glass on the
floor the way was now clear for him in-
to the yard

  he stood an instant peering out the
yard was deserted under the white glare of
a light on the wall nearly opposite the
wet bricks and little puddles of water
sparkled unevenly no sound save the pat-
tering of the rain

   i guess shell do remarked piano in
a calm voice so long buddy he paid
no further attention to the tied-up man in
the corner but stuck his head out through
the window cautiously looked up the yard
then down it noted that nobody was in sight
and-silent as a ghost-straddled the sill a
second later he was outside in the rain

  one glance told him that the guard upon
the wall was around the corner to westward
and that the coast was clear quietly un-
concernedly he walked with a quick and
firm step down the yard turned an angle of
the prison and approached the door lead-
ing into the corridor that he knew com-
municated with the office

   i sure do smell of gasoline something
savage thought die but i guess if i go
right through old flynn wont fall for it be-
fore im out well soon see anyhow

  now he was at the door

  he stopped to listen but no sounds came
to him save the drizzle of the pattering storm

  he took from his pocket the key and
noiselessly inserted it in the lock he tried
to turn it but it stuck with a precision
a skill a nicety due to long years of experi-
ence he manipulated it listening intently
he tried again it resisted he gave it the
full strength of his hand the lock yielded
grating the bolt slid back piano smiled
and nodded

  he attempted to withdraw the key but
this he could not do

  no matter said he to himself i
shant need it again itll make a good sou-
venir for the mugs

  he turned the knob pushed the door gent-
ly inward stuck his head into the dark cor-
ridor and looked both ways  nobody in
sight  cinch  exulted he  cinch sure
as guns


the railroad mans magazine

  into the corridor he stepped closed the
door after him and with a firm business-
like step walked toward die office as he
went he settled his cap over his eyes and
squared his shoulders his left hand he
slid into his pocket where the scissors lay

  now he was at the office door now the
door was open piano in a lightning glance
his heart throbbing suddenly as though to
burst saw that only flynn sat at the desk
inside the partitioned space where the regis-
ter is kept

  rotten day all right said piano step-
ping into the office

  the old man barely glancing up from his
paper grunted assent he thought he saw
nothing but a rain-soaked warder piano
gave him no time for observation but looked
up at the clock on the right hand wall thus
partly concealing his face then he turned
and walked forward across the square-tiled
floor toward the exit

  already he had readied it when some-
thing-the instinct of the old-time watch-
man perhaps or possibly the curious odor
of benzin that now permeated the office-
warned flynn of danger

  whats that ye say asked he dropping
his paper hey youse come back here
who th deuce-

  piano answering not swung the outer
door open and passed through the blood
was hammering in his temples his breath-
ing was labored and painful but he con-
trolled himself

  on die broad upper step of the granite
stairs leading down to the paved space in
front of the prison he even forced himself
to pause an instant and to look up at the
sky as though debating whether to go on or
not then quite deliberately he walked
down the steps-out into the world again

  outside yes but how far how infinitely
far from safety yet for already the old
watchman was after him piano reached the
bottom of the steps turned to the right and
advanced in the direction of the little tri-
angular space where chapman austin and
washington streets all converge

  he had now perhaps fifty yards to go be-
fore he could swing into chapman and make
a break for the railroad a quarter of a mile
southwest-his objective point flynn from
the steps was bawling something after him
he knew not what other cries arose a
gong began to bang and rattle piano spat
out a curse

  nothing to gain now he realized by sub-
terfuge or any more delay he jammed his

cap tight down onto his head picked up his
heels and broke into a swift run behind
him he heard cries and sharp excited voices
a revolver cracked past his head zooned a
waspish bit of lead piano fled

  up in front of him loomed a man a civi-
lian with outspread arms piano leaped at
him brandishing the scissors the mans
courage died he jumped aside and swore
piano doubled the corner of the wall to the
right and like an arrow sped along the
brick sidewalk through the gloom his feet
shod in rough prison leather clattered a
rapid-fire tattoo

  there were only a few people abroad the
street was ill lit by occasional flaring gas-
lamps pianos blue clothes and vizored
cap confuscd folk he had a block or two
the start of any real pursuit and cleverly
he shouted as he ran

   hey stop stop head him off
hey there he goes 

  thus shouting pointing wildly he di-
aerted attention as he passed the gaping
occasional citizen like a streak of blue a
vague and swift form in the down-settling
fog that was all he wanted now just to
prevent interference from in front as for
anything behind he knew he could outdis-
tance all comers for a few minutes till his
wind should begin to fail  just let me
reach the track and im all right he
thought

  now he was there now he leaped past the
gatemans shanty darted westward with a
gathering crowd shouting behind him and
impeding the officials now right at hand
he saw a train of box cars

    heres luck eh   thought he and like a
storm-blown wraith vanished under one

  up again on the other side he scuttled
toward the freiglit-yard behind him he
heard shouts cries confusion despite his
panting breath the pain in his lungs the
leaping of his overtaxed heart he laughed

   the bulls will get a run for their coin
anyhow a good one he gibed

  there he goes yelled a voice a rock
came whirling then a lump of coal piano
made a dive between a couple of cars
crawled on hands and knees unseen across
a spur track and reached another string of
empties

  but as he scooted along the cinders be-
tween that string and a file of oil-tanks an
overall-clad brakeman suddenly barred his
passage piano saw the man crouch and
double his fists

  waiting not to be attacked the fugitive
the steeled conscience



snatched up a broken fish-plate weighing
perhaps ten pounds and hurled it full force
with most excellent aim

  the brakeman flung up his arm then
dropped it limp and broken with a howl
piano rushed at him landed him a blow
on the jaw and passed agile as a hunted
jack-rabbit

  he heard a whistle blowing then came
the rapid tolling of a big bell

    lots doing eh   grunted he

  near a switch-tower he paused to recon-
noiter for a minute or two he had shaken
pursuit off his trail panting he glanced
about him

  theres the tower all right he said
the lumber-yards just beyond if i can
only reach that now im o k

  down the yard he heard voices calling
coming nearer and nearer two tracks from
him a clattering bump-bump-bump told him
a train was being moved warily he dodged
under a car crawled across a vacant track
and reached the slow-moving train

  he stepped between two of the cars and
hoisted himself on the bumpers crouching
he was carried slowly past the tower then
he heard angry yells rightly he surmised
that some officer or other was shouting at
the engine-men ordering them to shift no
rolling-stock till the yard had been searched

  with a satirical smile he peered out from
his shelter dimly through the fog he saw
men stumbling along the track toward him
two or three lanterns splotched the gloom
with yellow

  come along and welcome he gibed
climbing over to the other side of the train
which now gritted to a stop

  as the brake-shoes stopped squealing he
dropped lightly to the ground there she
is  he exclaimed

  before him rose a high board fence over
the top of which he saw piles of seasoning
lumber piano skirted this fencej slinking
double in the railroad-ditch slopping
through mud and water directly toward the
noise of pursuit which now sounded ever
louder as he went he scrutinized the fence

    ah  said he all at once

  one-of the boards had a chalk-mark on it
piano scrambled up out of the ditch took
hold of this board and pulled it outward
it had been detached at the bottom and gave
he pulled harder he made an opening big
enough to crawl through into the lumber-
yard he crept the board sprang back into
place

  he stood up drew a long breath and

looked around him at sight of another
chalk-mark on a pile somewhat to the left
he smiled  slim has certainly been on the
job and done things right he affirmed
cheerfully that mentor i sent him did
the biz 

  proceeding through the mud to the marked
pile he knelt down reached far in under
it and felt around his fingers touched some-
thing-a bundle he drew the bundle out
and opened it

   couldnt be better smiled he survey-
ing by the dim light the greasy overalls and
jumper the cap and worn shoes it contained

  three minutes later he stood there in the
garb of a workingman

   here goes for the old stuff and theyre
welcome to it he exclaimed he laid his
discarded outfit on the ground put a rock on
it rolled clothes shoes and rock all together
and with a great heave hurled the mass far
over the fence it fell into an empty coal-
car where next day it was discovered out
at allston-a clue which utterly finished up
the tangle of purposeless official pursuit

  in the pocket of the disguise piano found
a cob pipe tobacco and matches calmly
he filled the pipe and lighted it then
smoking like an honest man weary with a
hard days work he made his way through
the lumber-yard to the gate passed through
unchallenged with the crowd of home-going
toilers and thereafter vanished wholly from
the ken of the law

  just a little over a week later number
 received by mail from new york a
book which after having been inspected at
the office was allowed to reach him it was
a copy of carlyles past and present
there was no donors name inscribed but
chapter ii the sphinx had been
marked with a blue pencil

  twenty-seven-o-four smiled to himself

  well piano reflected he i guess
youre safe by now its just possible-
maybe more than possible-you and i may
meet again one of these days i shouldnt
wonder if perhaps you could help me help
me more than any law eh

  then he sat down and began reading the
chapter

chapter xi

  new thoughts and an old friend

vle understood before it was half done
 why piano had chosen just this book
from among all others and this chapter in


the railroad mans magazine

the book for here and there through it
sentences and paragraphs leaped out at him
convincing thought stirring inspiring as the
occasional shrewd bitter or philosophical
flashes that the escaped yegg had formerly at
rare intervals let drive at him over a few
lines lie lingered especially his eyes vague
and half-closed as though seeing far visions

 he read the chapter through that eve-
ning and the whole book in a few days
the chapter itself he reread many many
times in the succeeding months some of its
fatalism its savagely worded triumphant
irony burned itself into his brain it became
part of him it helped him to see clearly to
understand some things which till now had
been but half-seen dimly comprehended

    foolish men imagine cried carlyle to him
  that because judgment for an evil thing is de-
  layed there is no justice   judgment   
  is many times delayed some day or two   
  but it is as sure as life it is as sure as death

     forget that thou hast forgotten all suc-
  cess will never more attend thee no more
  success mere sham-success    rising ever
  higher toward its tarpeian rock

    the din of triumphant law-logic and all
  the shaking of horsehair wigs and learned
  sergeant gowns having comfortably ended   
  what says the high and highest court to the
  verdict for it is the court of courts that
  same where the universal soul of fact and
  very truth sits president-and thitherward
  more and more swiftly with a really terrible
  increase of swiftness all causes    crowd
  for revisal-for reversal with costs dost thou
  know that court hast thou ever had any law-
  practise there

  he thought of dill reading those words
of dill who all the long long years had robbed
him and betrayed him who for a mere ask-
ing of justice had reft him of liberty love
reputation future perhaps of life itself who
now dwelt in luxury and ease in safety in
the enjoyment of honor and esteem all but-
tressed and defended by the thing called law
he thought of agnes taken from him by
perjury and fraud-agnes whom he did not
blame whose face still haunted him-agnes
lost forever if the judgment of the court of
organized society should be allowed to stand

  so thinking his mouth tightened and the
strange look that dill had noticed in his
eyes the look that had so filled the old man
with apprehension and venom came back
more strongly more full of purpose than
ever

     oceans of horse-hair continents of parch-
  ment and learned-sergcant eloquence he read

  were it continued till the learned tongue wore
  itself small in the indefatigable learned mouth
  cannot make unjust just    enforce it by
  never such statuting three readings royal as-
  sents blow it to the four winds with all man-
  ner of quilted trumpeters and pursuivants in
  the rear of them stand never so many gibbets
  and hangmen it will not stand it cannot stand

  the unjust cannot stand queried the
convict of himself ah but i doubt that
a legal judgment rendered in court and
backed by all the powers of the state-what
shall overthrow it justice that is an-
other matter justice and law-two differ-
ent things

  things are because certain men have the
power to make them so men who are the
masters what they decree must stand right
or wrong if wrong then right must come
about because of other and different mastery
mastery it is at any rate that wins the
master comes into his own the  master-
over that word and that idea he brooded
long

  he read further

    in this world with its wild-whirling eddies
  and mad foam-oceans where    judgment
  for an unjust thing is sternly delayed dost
  thou therefore think there is no justice it is
  what the fool hath said in his heart  i tell
  thee again    one strong thing i find here
  below the just thing the true thing  if
  thou hadst all the artillery of woolwich trun-
  dling at thy back in support of an unjust thing
   i would advise thee to call halt  if
  the thing is unjust thou hast not succeeded
  no not though bonfires blazed from north to
  south and bells rang    and the just thing
  lay trampled out of sight to all mortal eyes an
  abolished and annihilated thing

    await the issue in all battles if you
  await the issue each fighter has prospered ac-
  cording to his fight

 and again	 

    what is justice that on the whole is the
  question of the sphinx to us the law of
  fact is that justice must and will be done
  the sooner the better for the time grows
  stringent frightfully pressing

     the grand question still remains was
the judgment just i-f unjust it will not and
 cannot get harbor for itself or continue to have
fooling in this universe

  all this and much more he read and pon-
dered he came to understand the character
of law as a class thing made by property
the steeled conscience



to defend property and backed up by police
courts prisons guns armies navies every
instrument of force or repression capable of
being used by property which is to say the
master of the world out of it all came to
him a clear conception of that mastery the
idea of it gradually took possession of him
but as yet he had gained no very clear idea
of the manner in which he meant to put it into
practical form

  bred all his life to respect the law merely
because it was the law without inquiring
into its origins meanings or applications he
did not in a single moment arrive at the full
consciousness of the thing that he must do
yet through all the days and weeks and
months that followed the leaven of under-
standing of knowledge of determination
was surely working in his soul

  one day after he had almost learned the
book by heart an idea occurred to him he
marked certain of the most stinging passages
and had it sent to martin stone in new
york later he wrote stone a letter which
gave him to understand that the book was to
be forwarded to dill at san remo dill
eventually received it and his insomnia took
no benefit from its reading always before
the old mans eyes hovered the vision of a
time surely to come when all his subter-
fuges all his power could no longer keep the
sender of that book behind steel bars when-
graham should be graham again no longer
 when justice-not law-might yet be
done

  each month that passed aged him six
months he grew almost from day to day
decrepit agnes who smiled but rarely sat
with her father long long hours gazing out
through the palms and orange-trees at the
mediterranean at the red and blue sailed
latteen-rigged fishing boats she had grown
grave and very thoughtful it seemed but
with all her thought she asked no questions
of her father she too had her problems
deep seemingly insoluble

  so for them all the time dragged on

  as it passed  found himself more and
more wholly forgotten by the outside world
barnard had long since given up any pre-
tense of coming to visit him and stones
letters were growing very rare the convict
came to think the thoughts of the peniten-
tiary to live its life even to take a certain
interest in its brutal or petty happenings and
its inmates men in prison he found dif-
fered very little from men outside they had
simply been caught that was all

  when an occasional commission or socio-

    	rr

logical club came to visit die place to peek
through the bars pry question and patron-
ize do like people at a zoo all save actually
poking the convicts with umbrellas 
grew sick at their drivel and hypocrisy it
all sounded like dill himself

  the prisoner had a keen notion that much
of all visitors interest rose from the sneak-
ing hidden fear each one of them had that
some time they too might surely get their
just deserts and sit in gray thinking of
this  recalled pianos wisdom and
smiled

  he lived his own life of reflection in the
company of books he did his work said
nothing got no black marks and became a
model prisoner he refused to let persecu-
tion goad him to anger if shrieks rang
through the iron house of sorrow if some un-
fortunate  went woody  and dashed himself
howling against the bars till drugs and force
quieted him  listened thought but kept
silent

  twice came awful days when the word
was whispered round that a condemned man
was going up salt creek days when no-
body went to work in the shops when the
atmosphere grew tense with horror when bul-
let-headed and misshapen hulks of men
damned by their birth and breeding knelt
in fear on the stones prayed moaned cursed
gibed wept-execution days when in the
death-house the chair burned out a human
life then  noted everything he nei-
ther cursed nor prayed he thought

  so two years more passed the prisoner
found that subtle changes were taking place
in the structure of his mind each trivial
incident began to assume undue importance
things that outside would not have been
worth a minutes thought began to loom big
before his mental vision he found himself
losing his sense of proportion if anything
went wrong at the switch-board if the li-
brary-officer came to his cell while he was
out at exercise and his book was not changed
that slight annoyance cast a gloom over him
made him brood for an hour or two

  what man asked he ever was  re-
formed  by any such unnatural conditions of
seclusion silence and monotony what
man having committed crime but must go
forth from prison a worse man than he had
entered it wiser in methods instructed by the
masters of evil embittered hardened twen-
ty-seven-o-four shuddered his hope now
his one desire was that something of his old
self might be left to him at the time of his
release


the railroad mans magazine

  release came at last a commonplace and
routine thing like every other one may
day four years and a month from the time
of his incarceration  was summoned to
the office there he was told that the fol-
lowing week he would be free he was given
a stereotyped moral lecture and sent back to
his work the news made little impression
on him it seemed to bear no essence of
reality-to be a mere delusion a bit of fic-
tion a vapor of the fancy rather than ela-
tion it brought anxiety

  a strange feeling of apprehension of
shrinking from the outside world began to
possess the convict what would it be like
now liberty the other time friends the
work the world-what the man realized
that his years of servitude of dependence
had worn down his nerves and brain habit
had worked its will on him wien the last
day came he felt that he would rather put
off his freedom for another day

  not to-day he thought to-morrow
perhaps to-morrow i shall be ready not
to-day 

  they gave him a cheap ill-fitting suit of
shoddy clothes a five-dollar bill some plati-
tudes and perfunctory hand-shakes and
turned him out like a blind man into the
glare of furnaces-a blind man who knew
not which way to turn that he might avoid
the fire

  as he stood on the granite steps blinking
up at the sky breathing the spring air look-
ing with wonder at the passing drays and
wagons his ears offended by the unusual
noise he felt for a minute the strong impulse
to walk back into the shelter of the peniten-
tiary go to his switch-board or return to his
accustomed cell and take up once more the
half-finished book

   its-its all so different from what i
thought it would be like he exclaimed
dazed and perplexed he stood there a min-
ute or two trying to realize the truth that he
was free free yet not the same man that
he had been never the same man never any
more

  years and years gone far more years than
the actual toll of four a seeming eternity
graham gasped slightly walked down the
steps with an uncertain slouching tread
turned to the right and with the prison
shuffle due to endless lock-stepping started
toward city square

  how high the houses seemed how omi-
nous the open unbarred spaces almost like
a sufferer from that singular disease called

to be co

agoraphobia he shunned the outer edge of
the sidewalk and crept along close to the
wall he touched the wall with his hand it
gave him confidence two or three passers-
by turned to look at him smiling with wise
patronage they knew

   at the corner of the long wall where the
penitentiary enclosure ends  he stopped
there was an open square to cross he
stood looking at it confused and weak sud-
denly he turned his head and started sharply
a man had spoken to him

   carlyle the man had said just that
one word

   graham looked at the man not yet under-
standing

   he saw a compact middle-statured fellow
of indeterminate age shaven carefully and
correctly dressed with a singular cast in
his world-wise steady eyes the man
stretched out a palm to him graham shook
hands unresistingly

    i knew you were getting your turn-out
this afternoonj he remarked we have a
way of knowing things all sorts of things
in my world thats more than your  res-
pectable  friends can say i notice there
arent any crowds of them waiting to receive
you eh  

   who-who are you   asked graham
astonished

  who am i oh just a lover of good
comfort and good literature an especial ad-
mirer of carlyle thats all and the man
laughed easily  come along he added
taking grahams arm you need some-
body with you for a while till things be-
gin to straighten out i know all about it
myself ive been there newly-hatched
more than once-feeling just like you feel
now dont worry dont try to think just
come along with me ill see you through
trust me my lad ive never sunk a pal
yet and i never will come 

   graham felt a sense of singular uneasi-
ness almost of dread but half-dazed as he
was by the strong light the noise the va-
cancy of the unbarred spaces before him he
yielded

   the two men arm in arm headed along
the ugliness of charlestowns streets toward
the l station in the square the great-
er ugliness of the penitentiary faded behind
them

  all at once graham stopped passed a
band over his eyes and looked the man
square in the face

by c w beels

during the week beginning monday september  at  a m and ending
saturday september  at noon the trunk-line roads running into new
york city unloaded  people pretty near the entire city of phila-
delphia landed by trains in the great metropolis the entire population of madrid
rome and yokohama poured into this great big new york inside of  hours

    and this was accomplished with no more commotion than would be occa-
sioned by the arrival of a delegation from cowcreek corners

     this is the greatest record for train-service in a single city within ten hours
on labor day the new york central lines alone handled over  extra people
this number added to the  regulars is the record for one terminal

    not an accident was recorded on any road handling these hundreds of thou-
sands of human beings

how  human beings were safely landed by trains in new york
city in one week the greatest world
industry-and why

reater new york the
 imperial city of the western
 hemisphere now contains -
  inhabitants these
 are the figures as given out by
 the census bureau which is
 now completing its work at washington
 d c that is a pretty big family for father

knickerbocker to take care of and especially
in summer when most people feel the neces-
sity of a trip to the mountains or the sea

  it is estimated that over one-half of the
population of greater new york seeks the
country in some way or other during the
hot weather the populace goes away some

the railroad mans magazine

but it returns in a heap labor day marks
the end of the outing season and on that
day and the day following the railroads en-
tering new york city handle an army of
people

  the new york central lines estimated
that over  homeward-bound people
passed through their gates on labor day of
this year-and the majority of that number
was recorded between twelve oclock noon
and midnight

  the new haven and new york central
in addition to its normal commuting traffic
of  passengers a day brought in -

	returning holiday folk

  the seashore division of the pennsyl-
vania in addition to its normal  in-
coming passengers brought back about -

	who had been staying on the jersey
coast

  the long island railroad which through
august carried about  passengers each
way daily had to transport  extra
holiday folk who have been spending the
summer on the north or south long island
shores

over  extra cars

  in consequence the home - coming rush
which according to railroad men was the
biggest that has ever followed a labor day
in this citys history did all kinds of things
to the time-tables and strained railway equip-
ments to their fullest capacity the cen-
tral and new haven had to put on  ex-
tra cars the long island had to run
eighteen extra trains of ten cars each

  the pennsylvania on its seashore divi-
sion tapping asbury park and the other at-
lantic coast resorts as far as point pleas-
ant had to put on thirty additional trains
most of these were made up of the pennsyl-
vanias new steel cars seating  passengers
each there were from eight to eleven of
these cars in each train which pulled into the
pennsylvania train-shed

  the adirondack express which runs from
the thousand islands to new york city
perhaps broke the record for passenger-trains
so far as size is concerned this train was
sent over its route in sixteen sections

  the first arrived at the grand central
station on time the sixteenth just four hours
later

  new york central officials a week before
labor day found that the adirondack ex-
press would have to carry  passengers
from the northeastern part of the state into

this city to carry  passengers in the
ten cars of which the adirondack express
is made up on ordinary nights

  big railroads dont have much trouble in
meeting such problems the new york cen-
tral simply said all those people want to
get home in one day and it is up to us to get
them home

over  in one train

  the company by telegraph and phone
got a line on about  drawing-room sleep-
ing-car and day-coaches by evening they
divided these up into sixteen separate trains
and sent the adirondack express with its
 home-seeking passengers back to this
city in sixteen sections

  these sections had to be started five min-
utes apart passengers in the last section
were consequently something like  hour and
 minutes late in reaching this city but
this the railroad company pointed out was
a lot better for the passengers than trying to
crowd  into a smaller number of cars

  the seashore division officials of the
pennsylvania pleased its home-coming crowds
mightily on labor day by doing something
which might have tangled up a less well-or-
ganized railroad considerably affd which
puzzled many watch-holding passengers a
good deal

  feeling sure that the home-seekers would
begin collecting at the various stations long
ahead of time the officials decided to run
the  in nine sections and have the first
of these sections start fifty minutes ahead of
schedule time	-

the separate sections

  each section was made up of from eight
to eleven cars calculated to hold eighty per-
sons each the guards and conductors were
also instructed to shout

  new york train first section of the
new york express unusually loud when
the train entered a station

  most of the holiday folk who were waiting
on the platforms were so anxious to get home
that they didnt take time to look at their
watches and scrambled aboard in triumph-
ant ignorance of what the railroad had done
to please them

  many of the first sections passengers were
startled when they reached new york city
and saw by the clocks on the buildings that
they had arrived here fifty minutes ahead of
time
the worlds record for passenger traffic



  the pennsylvania railroad had to run two
additional baggage-trains of six cars each
on labor day so numerous were the trunks
the road had to carry according to its
officials the new york or seashore divi-
sion brought back twenty per cent more
home-jcomers than it did after labor day
last year

  the long island railroad also carried
more people home to new york than on any
other labor day in its history

  we carried  people out of new
york city on july  said one long island
official  we didnt carry them all back
again but we carried back s pieces of
baggage and between  and - boxes
full of fish crabs and oysters which our
patrons had caught themselves

    this also happens to be cauliflower time
and what room in the baggage cars that
wasnt taken up with fish contained vege-
tables on labor day night because of the
rush almost all our trains were from twenty
minutes to one and a half hours late there
was not an accident

figures that talk

  the crowd which waited for home-coming
relatives in front of the bulletin board on the
upper train-level of the new york centrals
terminal was much pleased with the working
of the automatic announcing system which
the central had introduced under this
system the number of each incoming train
is seen by an operator in the mott haven
observation tower he telephones it both to
the superintendents office and to the operator
at the fifty-fourth street switching tower

  the fifty-fourth street towerman is the
king of the whole yard from the point of
view of responsibility his mind is trained
to tell into exactly which one of the many
sidings he can switch each incoming train
while he jams down a lever an assistant
telephones to the superintendents office

  this office is equipped with an automatic
writing device which communicates with the
bulletin board on the upper track-level where
the passengers friends are waiting the
superintendent writes the news about each
train on a pad which is part of this auto-
matic writing device this writing appears
on a similar pad beside the announcer on
the upper track level who in turn writes it
with chalk on the bulletin-board

  this has been easily the largest labor
day traffic we have ever had said a new
york central official we carried in -

   people this morning and since friday
  have brought back  since friday
  we have had to put on  extra cars we
  brought back almost as many people on sat-
  urday and sunday as we did last night and
  this morning new yorkers are beginning to
  understand the inconvenience of all trying to
  come home on the same train

a mountain of trunks

     in three days the new york central has
  brought in  pieces of baggage and the
  new haven road has done likewise this
  has kept our new automobile baggage-trucks
  which carry twenty-five pieces of baggage a
  trip busy all the time

     you must take in a lot of money from all
  these passengers i said to one of the railroad
  officials

     yes we do he replied  buf we have
  use for it all the railroads are employing
  nearly  people to-day and if you
  count in the families that are dependent on
  these employees it is easy to estimate that
  we are supporting a big percentage of our
  population

    the biggest business in the country to-
  day is railroading he went on  there are
   roads now in operation in the united
  states and if they could hoard the money they
  gather from day to day from freight and pas-
  sengers there wouldnt be a dollar left in the
  country at the end of a year every piece
  of metal and paper currency in the country
  would be in the railroad treasuries the
  railroads earn in a year five times the whole
  worlds output of gold thirty times this coun-
  trys gold output they take in four times as
  much money as the steel corporation five
  times as much money as the government it-
  i self-more money than is represented in all
  our trade over seas

seven millions a day

    its a big business that takes in -
   in a year this is  a dav
  - a day

     and  of this money every day
  of the year goes into the pay-envelopes of the
  workers for half the money gathered in
  by the railroads-half of this 
  a year-is the workers share of the biggest of
  american businesses

     so in two years the railroad workers re-
  ceive in their pay-envelopes as much money
  as there is in circulation in the whole coun-
  try


the railroad mans magazine

  big figures these there is the humble
trackman usually an alien from the slums
of europe who doggedly obeys the orders of
the track-foreman out of every  gath-
ered in by the railroads  goes to him-five
times as much as goes to the railroad officials
the figures are big you see whether you start
from the bottom or top

  workers actually get  out of every
si for from the  paid for materials-
tails cars engines buildings etc- goes
to workers in these industries ever- time
you spend a dollar at a railroad ticket-office
or freight-office you are paying  cents for
wages

   the pay-roll of the united states rail-
roads amounts to a billion dollars a year

  when you look over this billion-dollar
pay-roll you get an idea of the bigness of
railroading take the smallest item there
is- paid in wages to telegraph-
ers and despatchers an army of  men
at the key this is more money than all the
telegraph companies in the country spend in
wages

what goes to the workers

  perhaps the largest item is 
in wages to shopmen you know perhaps
that railroads have shops where they mend
broken wheels and put new paint on cars on
the new york central climbing up the hill
out of albany with the help of a snorting
 pusher  on behind you may have noticed a
group of brick buildings-the west albany
shops or going over the pennsylvania
your attention has been attracted perhaps
to the altoona shops

   but did you ever know that the railroad
shops of the country employ an army of -

	men earning  a year in
wages this repair end of the railroad busi-
ness is bigger than the business of the
steel corporation itself-more men and more
wages

  the army of shopmen has a big job in
the shops of the big railroads locomotives and
cars are built as well as repaired the
smaller roads buy their equipment from the
independent builders but there is no road
so small but that it has its shops for repairing
equipment

  the railroads own  cars-of
which  are passenger-cars made up
into one train these cars would stretch around
the earth and to every fortieth car there would
ije a locomotive for the railroads have 
in sendee

   you could carry every man woman and
child in america in this train allowing only
forty passengers to a car its the business of
the third of a million shopmen to keep these
two and a quarter million cars and locomotives
in running order

armies of toilers

    a bigger army still is that on the track-
 men made up of  section-fore-
men-the bosses-and  humble work-
ers the lowest paid men in -the service aver-
aging  a week but they take  out of
every  of railroad revenue or -

	a year and no small part of this money
finds its way back to the old country

    many a good american citizen of to-day
earned his first money in this country as a
member of a track-gang

   how about the expenditure for oper-
ation i asked

  the railroads spent for operation last
year continued my informant  the enor-
mous sum of  of this sum
 was spent in running trains
and over  in maintaining road-bed
and equipment

   this official gave me the following facts

    included in this billion and three-quar-
ters is the billion-dollar pay-roll the other
three-quarters is spent on various materials
coal and steel being the principal items the
coal bill for the locomotives is the largest
single item-

besides the coal bill

   besidesthe coal bill there is spent for
locomotives  on water 
on oil tallow and waste and  on
other supplies-more than  in
all the tie bill is big- bigger
than the rail bill- stationery
and printing costs  advertising
 wrecks and other damages -
 clearing away wrecks 
killing and injuring people  in-
surance -and so on through a
score of items all in the millions

    how much the railroads spend on steel
products can only be guessed but consider-
ably more than half the products of the steel
mills are bought by the railroads the steel
industry is prince or pauper according as the
railroads are buying freely or not of their
products

    when the railroads give out orders for
rails cars locomotives bridges structural
the worlds record for passenger traffic



steel and other products of the steel industry
there is a boom and when they stop buying
theres- depression railroading steel-making
and coal-mining going hand in hand they
are the three great businesses that make
pittsburgh the greatest industrial town in the
world

the bondholders share

   the railroads pay out of their revenues
forty per cent for wages twenty-five per cent
for materials etc and three per cent for tax-
es and then there is still left thirty-two per
cent of the revenues the creditors-that is
the bondholders spread all over the earth-
owning  of american railroad
securities get thirteen per cent of the revenues
this nets them only  per cent on the par
value of their bonds there is still nineteen
per cent left of this twelve per cent goes
to the shareholders-the half million owners

   they receive  a year out of
the  earnings which nets them
only  per cent on their  of
stock the other seven per cent of the earn-
ings goes into surplus

  the train-crews with  engine-
men firemen conductors and trainmen make
up the third largest railroad army but they
head the wage list with  a year
they get more than a dollar out of every ten
received by the railroads

   the railroads earned last year gross
 the small end of the rail-
road business is the passenger traffic the
receipts from  passengers were -
 the average rate paid was a trifle
over two cents a mile

dealing with passengers

  when a person pays for a thing he ex-
pects to get full value for his money that
is just the way members of the traveling pub-
lic feel who pay to ride and for what the
company advertises to give them-namely
courtesy and attention from employees with
good service so it is  up to us  to live up to
this agreement

  we should live up to the rules regard-
ing making up trains and see that everything
is in good order that tfife air is tested proper-
ly that vestibule curtains are hooked up
and that a gate or chain is at the rear end of
the last car to keep the passengers from fall-
ing off and also that the cars are properly
ventilated

we should regulate the steam-heat-shut

off or put on as may be required be sure
the floor-valves are closed put cups at the
drinking-tanks and see that they are clean
the traveling public will appreciate it if
when we do this work we do it right

    when passengers get on or off your train
assist them-especially elderly people or
women with small children if they have suit-
cases or folding go-carts put these on the
train if any passenger asks you a question
answer it pleasantly-always speak as you
would like to have them speak to you

    if working on a through train be sure
that people getting on are getting the right
train after yours leaves its terminal close
all the doors and vestibule traps and unlock
the toilets be sure your aisles are clear of
suit-cases and packages so that passengers
getting on or off the train will not fall over
them

    when your train is running between sta-
tions go through the cars and see that they
are ventilated and heated properly and if
any of the passengers want anything such
as a seat turned or a chair lowered or any
little favor do it as if you were glad to do it

this is what pays

    before going into a station on a through
train go through the cars pulling the checks
telling the passengers when the next station
is theirs and if they are asleep wake them
up always giving them plenty of time to
get ready before arriving at their destina-
tion

    on arrival at the station go into each
car and announce the station so as to be un-
derstood repeat your call from each end of
the car and assist the passengers getting on
or off the train when you get through load-
ing go along the outside of the train looking
out for hot boxes and see that your brake-
rigging is all right

   remember in conversations with passen-
gers answering questions or when a passen-
ger is angry about something which does not
concern you but he still tries to  take it out 
on you or says something which you do not
like do not lose your head dont get ex-
cited-keep cool-and you will win out every
time

    if you are in the wrong you know what
the rules are and what the consequences will
be we all make mistakes-the best of men
do-but if you make one once try not to make
the same one again be generous and kind-
hearted and remember courtesy wins friends
for yourself as well as for the company

        of horace proves that love will have its way

onk threw down his newspaper
  and sighed like a november
  wind in a weeping willow i
  waited with a card poised
  for almost a minute expect-
  ing him to voice his mood in
  appropriate words-but he didnt well
  i said  whats eating you 

  he snorted equinely and awoke from his
reverie

   heigh-ho  he yawned  valhallas too
serene its as still as a vacuum all over
everythings jogging along so slick and noise-
less it makes a fellow lonesome if some-
thingd just go wrong so i could fix it i
believe id feel better but theres not even a
dog-fight to stir your pulse what my soul
craves is excitement action clamor-

  try the solace of solitaire i suggested
 theres another deck over there on the win-
dow-sill the flower-garden is a thriller
or let me play you that stirring melody en-
titled  im afraid to come home in the
dark 

  he shook his head

  i guess ill finish up my panoramo-
scope he mourned  i dont seem to take
no interest in anything you mention gimme
a little nip off that plug

  he filled his face with the weed that soothes
but does not inebriate and got out his junk
collection

  the thing he was concocting and which he
referred to as the panoramoscope was a black
box about the size of a cracker-case filled
with lenses mirrors and clockwork mechan-
ism when finished he expected it to do
marvels and it was all completed with the
exception of a couple of lenses for which he
had sent east

  the lenses had arrived that day and he
was ready to put the finishing touches on his
contraption

  this little contrivance he remarked
presently while at his tinkering- this little
contrivance now is quite full of possibilities
dont you know ill fix up a lookout on the
roof of the car where the view is extended
and the surrounding country within a radius
of thirty or forty miles will be brought under
our surveillance

   it will enable us to keep in touch with
local happenings conditions and affairs to
their minutest details i will be the general
directing his troops i install this machine
in my conning-tower seat myself comfortably
gaze upon the polished face of this screen and
what do i see  

   you see a stately fleet of ships flying
your pennant at anchor in the bay i ven-
tured or a nautch girl doing a cheap imi-
tation of salome or a dark-browed man com-
ing with an armload of bombs to wreck the
city a-ha the scene changes note the
swirling unrest the luminous haze the
transformation now the picture is mate-
rializing it is the moment of fate-
stuff something in your mouth said
honk this is no fortune-tellers trick-
box this is a scientific instrument built to
catch and register light rays it is a power-
ful telescope refracting mirrors reflectors and
projectors assembled and focused to bring
distant objects to your elbow for example
 you are forty-three miles away over there
toward the east well say you are slouch-
ing along in your usual way i am watching
your motions on this screen i see your shoe
is untied you stoop to tie it i note your
bored expression the string is in a hard
knot i watch you jerk it i see your lips
move a fly alights on your coat-sleeve and
preens his wings-

   have i got my bicycle with me im not
away over there on foot am i  

  im explaining this instrument said

honk  you set it up where the view is unob-
structed wind the clock and lean back every
minute detail of the surrounding country is
revealed to you in a slowly moving panorama
on this screen it is a telescope and peri-
scope combined-only better much better a
bird pecking at a cherry twenty miles away
a man plowing in a field thirty miles distant
you can tell whether his eyes are brown or
blue you can even see the freckles on his
nose

  its great i said with admiration
its the one thing thats been lacking in
rural communities every mattie in the
country from augusta maine to los an-
geles will have one regardless of cost it
beats listening over a party-line to a thin bat-
ter how much will it sell for

ill take the agency for ohio in-
diana kentucky illinois missou-
ri iowa kansas nebraska-

   it wont be for sale honk
said shortly no invention of
mine will ever be
subverted to base
uses

    oh thats all
right i reas-
sured him  i
knew you would
not sell it youre
afraid somebody
might have some
fun out of the
thing i shuffled
the cards again

 honk had a
sort of bird-cage
rigged up next
morning and
hoisted to the
roof of the
medicine house

in this aerie he
set up his pano-
ramoscope and a
chair and as the
siding in which
the car sat was on
reasonably high ground we had a fair sweep
at a section of the map about the size of
new england

   the fruit-farms the beet fields the high-
ways in all directions the inhabitants of
valhalla and its suburbs to the second and
third generations all came under his espion-
age if a careless housewife threw a tin can
in the alley or dumped soapsuds where they

would run athwart her neighbors back yard
honk saw it

  if a workman paused to light his pipe and
enjoy the scenery during the brief absence of
his foreman there was honk taking it all in
even to the number of missing buttons from
the loiterers shirt one mile or forty didnt
cut any figure

   if a peach-grower pruned a tree that didnt
suit honk although away beyond his hori-
zon he set up a howl about it he took the
burden of all the little dirty-faced kids in
that section upon his shoulders

  -that woman in the drab-colored house
across the road from what-his-names has
got four of the worst young uns i ever did
see he remarked at noon  they wrote all

the rubberneck habit
grows on you be-
fore vou know it

over the side of the kitchen with chalk
this morning broke down the front
gate swinging on it hung a cat to the clothes-
line pulled every flower she had blooming
and made mud pies on the front porch

   say but she walloped em though if
itd been twenty miles closer i could have
heard em yelp one got under the house
before she got to him hes under there
yet

  if i had your taste for household wor-
ries i said  id get ma set of knitting-nee-
dles and go visiting why dont you take
out a membership in a sewing circle

   come up and take a look around he
invited youre getting in a rut down here
with your snoot on the oilstone all the time


the railroad mans magazine

horace my boy come up and see the busy
world about you

  i piled the dinner dishes in the sink and
did so the panoramoscope was all he had
claimed for it in ten minutes i had be-
come engrossed in the graceful movements of
a couple of girls who looked to be about the
age of eighteen and who were picking cher-
ries some fifteen miles to the southeastward
one of them fell out of a tree

  there was also considerable excitement
when a woman and a small boy tried to chase
a pig out of a corn-field eight miles to the
north of us the rubberneck habit grows on
you before you know it i eagerly swept the
surrounding country with the unselfish inter-
est of the lady across the street when you
move into your new house

  honk descried a man loafing in the shade
of his shack at four oclock who he said had
been idling away the whole day hed been
doing that same sort of heavy sitting since ten
oclock honk said and anybody could see
that the weeds were taking his strawberry-
patch

  at length honk called the fellow up over
the telephone and inquired solici-
tously about his health wasnt he
feeling well he said he was he
was feeling finer than imported

silk he explained that it was a boy and
weighed twelve pounds

   but life is not all girls wading in irrigation
ditches or chickens scratching up the neigh-
bors gardens even while we are admiring
the gentle shower that makes the little posies
smile from ear to ear the thunderbolt crashes
with a rip and a roar sets fire to your hay-
stack and kills your best cow

  the tragic so closely presses on the heels of
the trivial that ofttimes you open your mouth
to guffaw and end by yelling ouch

  so in this connection and proving that the
foregoing hypothesis is no mere figure of
speech butch poteet fell in love with a farm-
ers daughter who lived three miles from the
power-house

  butch was riddled in the southern ex-
posure of a new pair of five-dollar trousers
with mustard-seed shot the girls father did
it when argument failed to convince butch
that he was persona non grata besides being 
superfluous around that immediate vicinity

  the wounds inflict-
ed while scattering
and of small moment
lacerated butchs feel-
ings frightfully but
he had no symptoms
of an inclination to
give up the girl-not
him

  he limped up to the
medicine house after
doc pillsbury got
through with him-
by the way isnt that
a gruesome name for
a physician to have
ive mentioned it to
doc once or twice
but he says he cant
see anything wrong
with it

  butch came up to
tell honk and me all
about his troubles
he used to be a hind
brakeman on the pea-
vine division - no
that has no connection
with the shooting

 were made for
each other ernestine
and me he said
never was two peo-
ple any more pals
than us but that old
man  rats in the cab-

i promised her the old gent
would see a spook all right
butch pqteets bride



bage-patch that old man o hers is a sav-
age whats he got agin me nothin
aint i white and free - born and smart
enough and good-lookin enough and got
money saved in the bank and all my bills
square to date

  no hes sore because if ernestine and
me was to up and get married hed lose the
best worker hes got on his place thats it
she knows it too and its a wonder to me
shell stand for it 

  the mental malady known to science as
acute sentimentalis or in its earlier stages as
puppus affectionitis quoth honk learnedly
 is a queer manifestation of the erratic hu-
man mind i speak from no intimate knowl-
edge of the subject-

   haw haw  i said

   i dare you to deny it he flared fixing
me with a baleful eye and reaching for a
monkey-wrench i maintained a hurt silence

   yes he continued  love is a disease
it is caused by germs like croup and colic
and la grippe it has a remedy however
sharp medicine but a sound cure as sir
walter raleigh said of something else once
upon a time the remedy is to marry the
girl he concluded sonorously

   or have her take off her wig i added
wthen order was again restored we resumed
the discussion of butch and his prospects

  you say you are in love with this miss
ernestine said honk whats her last
name how old is she why havent you
reported the matter before this

   yes i love her something fierce said
butch answering the questions in order
 her names barker shes twenty i havent
had no chance to tell you fellers about it be-
cause ive been too busy you know i work
nights at the power-plant-

  yes sakl honk well let that pass
you want the girl and you have money in
the bank how much  

 thirty-five dollars said butch proudly
and whats more its drawing interest too
did you get that horace he has thir-
ty-five wagon-wheels each drawing interest
make a note of that this young man is a
financier hell have a corner in money be-
fore you save enough to get a new suit
lets go up and find out if we can see
butchs girl in the panoramoscope i said
maybe we can figure out a scheme to bring
old man barker around while were resting
we clattered up the ladder trained the
muzzle of the machine in the direction butch
indicated and found her

  she was sitting out under a lilac-busli in

the yard sniffling to herself wasnt a bad-
looking girl either though a bit red-nosed
and blear-eyed under die circumstances i
felt sorry for her-oh this is a tragic story
all right-and if i a cynic and a scoffer felt
sorry picture the frenzied madness of butch
when lie saw those scalding tears and the
wrenched heart of honk who is as motherly
and sympathetic an old ruffian as ever cuddled
a kitten-although he wont admit it

   now wouldnt that jolt you   said honk
after butch quieted down look at that
poor forlorn young woman out there heart-
broken horace aint that a shame cry-
ing horace crying her pretty eyes out

   well i said  why dont you do some-
thing you are all the time blowing about
what you can do-

   well go out with him instantly and get
her he said decisively but butch declared
that that move would buy us nothing

  ive been trying to persuade her to run
away with me for weeks he said but she
wont fall for no elopement if her dad dont
come through with his ok why its all off
thats all 

  wonder what shed do if we could flash
butchs picture there in front of her life-
size i said

   hold it hold it  honk shouted  ive
got an idea help me down with this ma-
chine to where i can work it out ill have to
take the panoramoscope to pieces great
ha why not of course itll work 
keeping up a patter of unintelligible com-
ment lie led the way into the car which was
also our workshop and scientific experiment
station

  i am much addicted to levity and persi-
flage both in and out of season but i always
give honk credit for the spasms of genius by
which he is overtaken every now and then-
and this was one of those occasions

  dont speak he cautioned us dont
even breathe let me do all the talking i
am pursuing ail elusive and impalpable fig-
ment of thought across the boundless wastes
of science-he was dismantling the pano-
ramoscope as he prattled  what goes up
must come down its a poor rule that wont
work at least two ways a powerful light
behind it thus the reflected image pro-
jected outward instead of inward stand over
there just a trifle please horace connect
me this wire to the light-socket ha now
what do you think eh hows that

  the fact was we had two butch poteets in
the medicine house at that moment the
real butch with hanging jaw stood where i


the railroad mans magazine

shades of all the football heroes

what a kick

could almost touch him and the bogus
butch the reflection mirage specter or con-
jured image of the same size and identical
expression stood down toward the door with
his jaw hanging in the same manner it
took steady nerves to tell which was which

   great  said honk stupendous lift
your arms old scout both butches exe-
cuted the movement in perfect unison

   all right cut her out horace  the
figure nearest the door melted into nothing-
ness for once in my mad career i was over-
come with emotion i was actually in a per-
spiration

  the thing is as good as done i heard
honk saying well have you commit sui-
cide in the reservoir after writing this old
man barkuss of your terrible resolution and
then well haunt him until hell wish it had
been him instead

  but-but- said butcb i dont really
want to commit no suicide you know-

   certainly not returned honk  cer-

tainly not your mania runs more to the
homicidal but youre only supposed to you
understand butch looked greatly relieved

 get him a pencil and some paper horace
now write this old man as i dictate

he reeled off a message wherein the morose
and despondent butch heaped reproach and
invective upon the insti-
gator of his woes swore a
dreadful post-mortem ven-
geance by promising to
haunt the irascible old
gent to his lasting sorrow
and ended with an almost
audible splash in the lake
this was sealed stamped
and dropped in a letter-
box so that it would be
delivered that day

   now directed the
master of ceremonies it
will devolve on horace
here to wheel out and get
a word with ernestine
we dont want to worry
her unnecessarily we are not hun-
gering for any real suicides

 you go i said  or let butch
i wouldnt know what to say after i
got out there

ill tell you what to say said
honk curtly you take this bike
and skicldoo see her on the quiet if
possible if not go boldly up to the
front door and call her out tell her
shes been elected treasurer of the
sunday-school or something and whisper
your real message

   tell her were going to conjure spooks
after her dad until he repents and whenever
he does-wait a minute ive got another idea
well have butch talk into the phonograph
-wheres that box of blank records horace
well have him tell the old man that the only
terms under which he can lay the specter will
be to consent to a marriage between his
daughter and the astral shape of her lover

    you can take the phonograph out with
you and set it off at the psychological mo-
ment

   yes i said and get what butch got
maybe im not shot-proof or even fond of
being shot at

  use your wits said honk fore-
warned is forearmed and all that sort of
thing duck hell not be shooting at you
horace you act like a nervous child brace
up and get in the game i never knew you
to show the white feather before
butch poteets bride



  all right i said ill be the goat if
anything happens send my watch to my mar-
ried sister in st louis you can have- my
new patent-leathers

  laden with the phonograph a case con-
taining ten sensational graveyard records and
a fresh plug of chewing i trundled my hoop
out to the barker homestead just after twi-
light thickened into the gloom of night

  honk had focused and adjusted his spook-
box strung his wires and installed his appa-
ratus during the afternoon he had com-
puted and chalked the exact spots where
butch was to stand so that his figure would
be projected to the barkers front gate walk
up the path ramble around the yard peer
in the windows and everything just like a
bona fide ghost

  i hid my part of the manifestation under
a burdock-bush down the road and pedaled
boldly up to the front fence there was no
nioon but the starlight made a sort of a hazy
glow fortune smiled on me ernestine was
hanging on the front gate all by her lone-
some grieving for her lost lover the rest of
the barker family were eating supper in the
house

  i never talked so fast in my life i did
an hours explaining in ten minutes i had
to she was a big help though-she had
quick wits it didnt take me one minute to

find out that she was away yonder too good
for that lunk-head of a butch poteet but of
course as i had enlisted in his cause i had
to boost for him

  she said the old man had received butchs
letter with hoots and jeers he said hed
make any ghost that lit around that place
hard to catch i outlined the plan of cam-
paign and told her to keep calm whatever
happened

  i promised her that the old gent would see
a spook all right and more and that his shot-
gun would not harm anything except the
lawn and the shrubbery i further pledged
her my word that she and butch poteet would
be married in the parlor with old man bar-
kers hearty consent before the week was out
i said id bet on it

  her nose was swollen and shiny with weep-
ing but she was smiling when i mounted my
wheel to glide away i made up my mind
that the first chance i got id make some
pearly-toothed young damsel cry about me
its very poetic

  the old lion stamped out on the porch and
brayecl-does a lion bray-just as i got
safely away unobserved

   ernestine  he yawped raucously  you
come in this here house standin out there
snifflin in the dark by yourself if that fel-
lers drowned hisself like he said he was

the spook even gave
the cows sudden
delirium


the railroad mans magazine

going to do its a good riddance a con-
sarned good riddance he never amounted
to nothin an he never would have amounted
to nothin-do you hear  

   yes pa she replied meekly  im com-
ing in

  you better he said an eat your sup-
per like a girl with sense an help your in a
with the dish-washin

  he sat himself heavily on the porch and
got his pipe to going meanwhile the katy-
dids started up their rattling zig-a-zig

  luckily the barkers didnt have any dogs
dogs would have interfered seriously with my
part of the work l sneaked through the
fence crawled on my stomach behind bushes
and set die talking-machine up in a dark
clump i muffled its horn with my coat to en-
hance the sepulchral effect and i had a wire
cut-off arranged so i could start it or stop it
at my pleasure behind an adjacent tree

  it wasnt a very big tree it didnt shield
me entirely not even when i hid edgewise i
wished it might have been one of californias
famous redwoods but it wasnt however it
was better than no tree at all

  i	had everything in readiness and was
comfortably squatted when butch appeared
at the front fence i thought he flickered a
little at first but the light was uncertain he
melted through the front gate and walked
boldly up the path toward the smoker on the
porch without a crunch or a bobble

  could you see him i should say he
was as real as flesh and blood every feature
was distinct from his slouch-hat to the sag of
his trousers at the knees

  he stopped raised his finger and pointed
it toward the old man i pulled my wirp and
a weird hollow voice sounding like it came
from under the ground said barker i
have come 

  the old man was game-gamer than id
be under the same circumstances he made
two steps and a kick-shades of all the foot-
ball heroes what a kick it went entirely
through butch and jerked the old fellow off
the porrvi he alighted on his shoulder-
blades

  i	pulled the string and a peal of mocking
shivery laughter burst forth it was a tri-
umph for science the ghost walked a few
steps sidewise the old man gathered him-
self up and made a bee-line for the house
slam bang went the screen-door then
out he came with his gun in his hand and
murder in his eye

  butch stood ten feet away grinning airily
the old man took aim and let fly both bar-

rels it made an awful din i worked my
wire and the graveyard voice said barker
you are a fool ha ha ha 

  butch came right up to the step and
pointed his finger again in the old mans
face no rest will you get he said hol-
lowly atmy direction i will make your
life a burden to you 

  the remainder of the barker household
had rushed to the door when the artillery went
off-the old lady and two or three kids of
various ages also ernestine they all took
a look at butchs spook and set up a scream
work in enough screams on the side and it
takes a dandy to keep his calmness unruffled
old man barker was rattled completely

  you git out of my yard he roared
ill-ill-

  the voice said barker you are a fool
ha ha ha

  butchs girl rose to the occasion and ran
out to embrace him like they do in the moving-
pictures of daisy the village belle he
made mighty thin hugging

  when they saw her go through him miss
him and grab all over where he was and
never touch him the rest of the family made
one of the rowdiest retreats i ever saw they
retired in a rout the old gentleman with
them thoroughly awed ernestine followed
after heartrending appeals from the younger
members and went in trying to wring her
hands and saying

  its fred its fred

  fred being butch poteets nom de
apron-string

  the shade of the aforesaid fred stood
around-rather aimlessly for ten minutes or so
after the haunted folks had gone inside bar-
ricaded the door and wouldnt look out i
seized the opportunity to move the phono-
graph nearer to a window and put in a new
record when i started it off that time there
were moans gurglings and chokings that
made even my blood curdle

  just then butch came wafting up and
peered in at the same window down went
the blind then i sneaked up and ticked on
the glass with a penknife at the imminent
risk of getting shot you have to take some
chances however to make a good showing at
a seance every now and then you read about
a medium getting acid squirted on him or
something

  i	found where a pane was broken out after
a while and gave them my full repertoire of
ghost talk i told the old man that hi only
salvation was to consent to the wedding of
ernestine and the spirit of butch inter-
butch poteets bride



spersed with groanings and
gnashings told him hed
waken in the night and
find icy fingers choking
him and all kinds of grisly
things we concluded the
performance about eleven-
thirty with the enemy well
bottled up and quaking in
their beds and i pulled
my freight back to town

  it was no trick to put
butch over on barkers
front porch in the day-
time and it was simply
a matter of adjustment to
send him right alongside
the old man when he went
out to milk the spook
even scared the cows

  the starch was certainly
all out of that militant old
man by nightfall you can
reckon and when  started
out after supper to get in
some more body blows with
a new set of nerve-paraly-
zing records i took along a blue rocket to
send up whenever the old gentleman found
that he had enough

  ever see anybody have a nervous chill
well thats what daddy barker had when
the specter oozed through the gate and came
up to stand on the porch a while and point
his finger after supper they gave the old
fellow smelling-salts and whisky and
wrapped him in a blanket and you ought to
have heard him chattering foolish stuff

  whenever hed show symptoms of warming
up id pass him a few chokes and gurgles
through the broken window and at a quar-
ter-past eight he began to squeal for them to
get a preacher and get it over

   yes-yes-yes let em marry 

  the blue rocket sailed heavenward a mo-
ment later and the ghost disappeared so sud-
denly that i feared butch had fallen off the
car roof and broken his neck

  they came out in doc pillsburys auto-
mobile brought doc and a minister along

  ernestine had faded away long enough to
put mi her best pinafore and roach up her
hair a little and she looked cute enough for
any ghost to marry when the bridegroom
arrived if he hadnt arrived i would have
seriously considered taking his place

  doc tinkered the old man up somewhat-
gave him first aids calmed down his hys-
terics and all that-so he could wobble out

this aint no ghost

and give the bride away honk acted as best
man and we pressed one of the little sisters
in as bridesmaid and had a bang-up swell
wedding-as fine as anybodys

  when the handshaking-time came the old
man didnt rush up like the rest of us doc
pillsbury called his attention to it

   go on doc said  show the boy
youve got no grudge against him give em
the glad paw of congratulation and wish em
all kinds of good luck

  the old fellow tottered up with his blanket
around him like the big chief of the wasatch
and reached for butchs talon like it was
painted on the wall it was warm and hu-
man and alive he found

   this aint no ghost  he brayed

  you bet not said doc i want you
to understand im that boys physician and
lies a long ways from being a ghost 

    ill jest be consarned  ejaculated the old
man an you didnt drowned yourself
thats too bad-i mean im glad you didnt
all right poteet shes yours take her
honk and i were sitting quietly in the
medicine house an hour later the stir and
clamor gone the shaded electrolier shedding
its mellow glow on our slippered feet and
our high-strung nerves relaxed and purring

   thirty-five dollars he mused  thirty-
five dollars and then you beef about the
high cost of living

car-window sketches

   it was a typical canadian morning up
 to our windows came the smell of clover as
 the magnificent train swept up the twin-
 tracked highway for six or seven hours
  our trail lay along the banks of the st
 lawrence and the shore of lake ontario
 it was harvest-time men were busy in the
 fields and carters were hauling in the hay

       reapers reaping in the shocks
       of gold and girls in purple frocks

   to the right were the rolling uplands
 where larks were lifting from the mown
 meadows to the left beyond the wide st
 lawrence lay the peaceful shore of a foreign
 country watching with growing interest the
 evolution of a colony to a nation

   we had pulled out at  and now it
 was noon presently while this peerless
 panorama slipped past we lunched loafing
 along at a mile a minute our special was
 timed to reach toronto the provincial capital
 of ontario at  pm and when we stopped
 in the station the big clock in the depot
 tower was striking four

   we were now three hundred and thirty-
 three miles west and had changed engines
 but once an item of interest is the fact that
 these locomotives were designed by the head
 of the motive-power department and made in
 canada

   from toronto we dropped south along the

     	r r

west shore of lake ontario for forty miles
through a corner of  the garden of canada
to hamilton and swung westward along the
beautiful valley of dundas tying up at twi-
light at stratford where the big shops are
located

  a kind providence had arranged that the
avon should flow by stratford and the
master mechanic had provided a brass band
-and a very listenable band it was-com-
posed of mechanics from the shops

the stop-over at stratford

  after dinner our cars were cut and shuf-
fled and set in on the shop-yard tracks near
the band stand which stood by the railway
y m c a amid beds of flowers a gentle
rain drove us early to our twelve-wheeled
homes but far into the evening the air was
full of melody and the odor of sweet peas

  next morning the whistle blew in a whis-
per and we woke to see the sunshine drying
the eyes of the daisies

  after breakfast the master mechanic intro-
duced us to the shops and the mayor of
stratford they are wonderful-the shops
at stratford we saw a car of coal stop by
the power-house one man pulled a lever
and let the coal drop into a bin whence it was
scooped by halfa hundred buckets traveling
on an endless belt and dumped into a great
hopper from which it flowed through iron
pipes to the traveling grates below the boil-
ers and burned the ashes falling into an
ash-pit as the endless grates rolled round and
round

  we saw immense traveling cranes pick up
a one-hundred-ton locomotive and carry it
away hundreds of feet over the tops of
other engines as an eagle would carry away a
chicken and set it down at the other end of
the shop we saw nippers nipping off die
ends of seven-eighths steel bolts and spit-
ting the bites onto the floor powerful steam-
hammers were hammering great bars of iron
and in the lathes wheels were being turned
down the steel shavings from which were
purple with heat

a split-up at sarnia

  at noon of the second day we were at
sarnia where the line dives through an elec-
tric-lighted tunnel to the shores of the united
states

  here on the american side we inspected
the big power-plant whose machinery does
all things but think at stratford the load


the railroad mans magazine

was uniform during working-liours the de-
mand on the machinery being the same
throughout the day but here it is different
at times the machinery is idle then in thirty
seconds the plant is called upon to move a
thousand tons of traffic

  by an ingenious arrangement working
automatically the fans start the mechanical
stokers stoke faster the draft is furious and
in sixty seconds the fires are burning fiercely
beneath the great boilers then when the
demand ceases the machinery slows down
the blowers stop and the fire cools to a
steady glow ready for the next call

  this machine seems almost human each
force or factor depending upon another if
one part failed to work the entire plant would
go out of business

the parting of the ways

  sarnia proved to be the parting of the
ways here the chairman and the president
and the heads of all the departments whose
jurisdiction extended over the grand trunk
pacific as well as over the grand trunk
proper boarded the beautiful lake liner
hamonic and sailed away up the lakes to

fort william where they would pick up the
steel trail again travel across the prairie
provinces cross the rockies and sail up pu-
get sound- on the new steamship prince ru-
pert to the new city by that name on the north
coast of british columbia the western out-
post of the british empire

  as the hamonic steamed out of the beau-
tiful river our special sped on westward to
be ferried across lake michigan to milwau-
kee and then on to chicago the great railway
center of america and the western terminus
of the system in the united states 

  as our special sped over the west-bound
track with long manifest-freights and limited
trains brushing by us bound east i stopped
marveling at the mechanical devices and
their interdependence and began to muse
upon the wonderful human machine that runs
a railroad built on a sure foundation of faith
in each individual interdependent but not
interchangeable for each man must be a
master in his own line-bound together by a
spirit of loyalty that is loftier than friend-
ship a fidelity to duty that is stouter than
steel

  it is indeed wonderful the modern
machine that operates a railway

money in locomotives

recent earnings of engine-building plant show heavy increase over
those of the years previous

this year the american locomotive companys
gross earnings of  were -
 larger than the previous year and the
net earnings of  were  heavier
this left a surplus of  after paying inter-
est on bonds and preferred dividends whereas the
meeting of these obligations resulted in a deficit of
 in  the report shows that the bal-
ance of surplus for the year over and above  per
cent preferred stock dividends was equal to 
per cent on the  common stock as com-
pared with nothing earned on that issue in the year
previous

  w h marshall the companys president says
that during the first half of the fiscal year there
was but slight increase in the monthly output as
compared with that of the preceding year of de-
pression the revival of plant activities being con-
fined to the six months ended june  

  about the time of this resumption in activity
the agitation throughout the country for increased

wages spread to the companys plant and this
company in common with other industrial and rail-
road companies made substantial increases in
wages-of shop employees as a large part of the
output for the year had been sold at prices which
did not anticipate the extent of such labor increases
there was a resultant decrease in the margin of
profit

  president marshall says that to meet the con-
stantly increasing demand for an economical com-
mercial vehicle and in view of the possibilities of
this line of industry the automobile department
has devoted considerable study to perfect the design
of commercial trucks he also states that the com-
pany now has a most successful three-ton truck and
a five-ton truck has been developed and will be put
on the market during the present year

  at the beginning of the fiscal year the company

dirk johnsons bank robbery

by augustus wittfeld

                an amateur detective gets a hot
                clue but fails to reap the reward

ugan and curran were watch-
 ing with interest the work on
 the new iron bridge at tacony

  as the great iron crane swung
  a massive upright into place
  dugan voiced his approval of
  modern methods of construction

      i tell you curran it takes american in-
  genuity and american push to get things
  done quickly do you remember back in
   when the american bridge-builders in-
  vaded africa to finish up the construction
  of the bridges in uganda on the cape-to-

	cairo railway

      cant say as i ever heard of it replied
  curran

    what kind of hibernating animal are
  you anyway  asked dugan  dont you
  ever absorb any of the history of your glori-
  ous country that is constantly in the making
  when a handful of your countrymen leave
  home and mother to take up temporary quar-
  ters and grow american garden-truck and
  american bridges in darkest africa i should
  presume that you would experience a few
  thrills of patriotism

    what you talking about anyway
 growled curran  im no erudite college
 professor

    im talking about the country where
  considerably less than fifty years ago there
  was only one white man registered and he
  was mislaid his name was livingston
  there was another man named stanley of
  whom i suppose you never heard who went
  out and found him and returned him to his
  anxious country in less than fifty years the
  home of the ancestors of burnt-cork min-



  strelsy has blossomed into a metropolis and
  the natives instead of dodging tippoo tib
  and other slave dealers are busily engaged
  in dodging american locomotives that run
  along american rails

   hear hear  interrupted curran

   the railroad continued dugan  was
built by our british cousins but in 
they found it necessary to call on american
brains to complete some unfinished bridges

   just open the portals of that vacuous
mind of yours and try to absorb these facts

   a handful of american workmen assist-
ed by unskilled native labor erected twenty-
seven bridges in fifty-three weeks and they
did it at a cost lower than the competing
british firm bid for placing the bridge ma-
terial on board ship and while you are
assimilating this information try and re-
member that the work was under the super-
vision of a twenty-four-year-old kid from
pennsylvania named leuder

   say queried curran  are you chief
statistician of the railroad world or just an
ordinary bum fireman

   im a fireman by vocation and a student
by avocation replied dugan  get a hunch
on you curran and take an interest in
vital statistics get the study habit and
it wont be long before you are promoted
from your post of suffix speed-suppressor

   say you encyclopedic coal-tosser re-
plied curran  i dont see you graduating
from the ranks of the industrial army on the
strength of your learning you aint no
blooming captain of industry

  no replied dugan and im not dead
yet did you ever hear of dirk johnson


the railroad mans magazine

   and who might he have been   asked
curran another one of those makers of
history youre dippy on  

  no replied dugan he was just an
humble bridge-worker perhaps he went to
africa with that record-breaking outfit and
perhaps he didnt looking at those fellows
rushing that bridge reminds me of him and
of a howling mix-up of which he formed
one of the component parts

   some years ago i made his acquaintance
in new york city whither he had drifted
with a roll the size of an auto-tire when he
got through showing the natives  how he
had to look around for work there was
nodiing doing in his line so he connected
with a job in a retail safe store

   his duties consisted of assisting in the
delivery of those little toy security-boxes that
weigh about as much as an ordinary box-car

   delivering such goods to the inhabitants
of metropolitan sky-scrapers is about as ex-
citing as were the duties of the palaeozoic
expressman in the time of the cliff-dwellers

  well one day they loaded up one of
those harveyized cash-boxes in which the
average new york business man stores his
reputation over night and started to deliver
the goods they stopped in front of one of
those tall temples of mammon and soon had
their hoisting apparatus in position

   when everything was in readiness to start
the burglar-proof security sideboard on its
upward journey the foreman of the gang
instructed dirk to go on top of the safe and
keep things in order on the way up that
was just in dirks line and he considered
the assignment in the light of a sinecure

   the massive money-box ascended slowly
and dirk had lots of leisure to observe
the customs and habits of sky-scraperdom
through the windows of the building

    as the safe rose to the level of the fourth-
floor window dirk glanced at the gold-let-
tering on the pane it read

catchem  jailem

detective agency

  inside he noted two men engaged in ear-
nest conversation as the safe rose higher
dirk noticed that the upper sash was pulled
down for ventilation and as his head came
opposite the opening he heard one of the men
say

     i	tell you bill vandyke red is in new
york im on to his methods and i know

that this is the burg hed make for after
pulling off a successful job like he did at
the seventh national at st louis if we
can only land him it will mean a large
reward

  the reply was lost to dirk for the safe
had carried him above the open window

   dirk recalled the hold-up the men were
discussing he had read a few days pre-
vious how a lone robber with a red vandyke
and a brace of blued steel barkers had held
up the paying-teller of a bank in st louis
and gotten away scot-free with his booty

     gee  he soliloquized  if i could only
land that pink-whiskered piute id resign
my job on the high and heavy section

  the next two floors were passed without
incident but when dirks eyes rose above
the level of the window on the seventh floor
he was astonished to see a large room fitted
up like a bank he wondered why a bank
should be located on the seventh floor of a
sky-scraper but concluded it was for the
convenience of the occupants of the building
facing him at the far end of the room were
the paying and receiving tellers windows at
which several people were transacting busi-
ness

  the place presented the activity of such
institutions and dirk cogitated on the time
when he used to deposit his savings in his
home-town saving fund and he wished he
was in position to cash a check for a couple
of hundred then it would be adios to the
giddy  garden of allah  and back to the
home of smoke and stogies

   there was a lull in the activity of the
bank then dirk nearly fell off the safe as
a man entered with red vandyke face-trim-
mings and an alligator grip he made his
way directly to the paying-tellers window
and deposited the grip on the ledge after
handing the teller a check

   tbat fellow certainly looks some like
that fellow those fly-cops were discussing
cogitated dirk

   the safe had stopped on a level with the
open window and dirk was suddenly as-
tounded to see the man draw a pair of re-
volvers from the grip and point them at the
man behind the glass partition he saw the
paying-teller throw up his hands and then
at a command from the robber reach for the
grip and commence stuffing it with packages
ot bank-notes

     this is where i get off chuckled dirk
 vandyke reds my meat

  a few swift strides brought him directly
behind the man with the guns dirk went
dirk johnsons bank robbery



into executive session without waiting for
roll-call and soaked the hold-up artist one
in the vertebra then throwing his arms
around him he swung him around facing the
front windows so his shots could do no dam-
age the robber struggled to free himself
but dirk held on tightly

   suddenly he heard the pistols clatter on
the floor and then he felt a strong arm secure
a fancy wrestling-grip and then he found
himself sailing through the air over the oth-
ers head he landed in a sitting posture with
sufficient force to loosen his teeth and knock
the breath out of him 

   before he had time to recover his wits or
his breath his antagonist had grabbed him
under the arms and was propelling him feet
foremost over the highly polished floor to-
ward the door suddenly he was raised to
his feet and was conscious of a violent rear-
end collision which threw him into the cor-
ridor

      well that fellows a hot sock all right
mused dirk addressing the door which had
been slammed after him  i guess i butted
into the wrong combination but he wont get
away with the goods if i can help it

   he ran swiftly to the elevator and en-
tered the car

    let me off at the fourth floor quick
he told the operator

    aw get wise retorted the boy  this
cars going up

  see here son said dirk taking him
gently by the back of the neck and swinging
him to one side  this car is going down

   he seized the wheel and started the car
downward at the fourth floor he stopped

    now you young indian he command-
ed  chase that car down to the first floor and
tell somebody in authority to let no one out
of the building theres a desperate robber
up on the seventh floor and hes got to be
captured

   all right old cap collier answered
the youth  me for a share in the glory
elevator henrv the hero of the hour im
off	

  dirk scudded down the corridor until
he came to a door bearing the sign of catchem
 jailem pushing the door open he rushed
in

     say he shouted  do you want to catch
vandyke red  	 -

  catchem  jailem sprang to their feet
as one man

     where is he  they sang in an anxious

duet

    up-stairs replied dirk  i just had

a go with him come on ill show you the
way

    into the hall they raced dirk leading by

a neck

what floor is he on- called catchem

     seventh chirped dirk

take the stairs commanded jailem
 well lose time if we wait for the elevator

    all right assented dirk  you take
the lead i dont know where they are

   along the hall the trio sped they
readied the stairs and commenced the race
upward at the fifth floor dirk was puffing
by the time they reached the sixth dirk was
panting and when they reached the seventh
dirks pants were short

    this way called dirk pounding along
like a slow freight the sleuths followed
and dirk who was getting his second wind
suddenly turned into another corridor he
noted the elevator-shaft some distance ahead
with the bank-entrance facing it as a
descending car stopped he saw the man with
the red vandyke hurry from the bank and
board the car the door clanged shut and
when they reached the shaft the car was going
down rapidly

  while they were standing there unde-
cided as to the next move a car stopped at
the adjoining shaft and the operator called

	down 

   they made a rush for it and got aboard
dirk recognized the operator as the one he
had impressed into service a few minutes be-
fore  is the entrance guarded   he asked

   yes cap replied the youth  you can
depend upon elevator henry to do your bid-
ding its not every kid can corrolobate with
the king of detectives

  catchem  jailem looked on in amaze-
ment this was a new one to them

    first floor shouted the operator  ele-
vator henryll be in at the death

   dirk and the two sleuths stepped from
the car the man with the red vandyke was
in earnest conversation with two men who
barred his passage catchem pressed for-
ward and standing in front of the man
eyed him critically

     its all up red he said  dont make
any attempt at a getaway as i have you
covered with my gun in my coat-pocket take
him along boys he said as dirk and jailem
seized the prisoner on either side

     where to  asked dirk

     back to the bank replied catchem

    back to the elevator they led their cap-
tive and elevator henry carried them up to
the seventh floor in express time


the railroad mans magazine

   as they entered the bank the paying-teller
glanced up and looked at the quartet in
amazement

  then he hurried forward

     what is the meaning of this van  he
asked addressing the prisoner

     harry said the prisoner  allow me to
present my friends to you this indicating
dirk  is the gentleman who took the lesson
in wrestling a few minutes ago these two
gentlemen indicating catchem  jailem
 are real live detectives

    say questioned dirk addressing the
receiving-teller  didnt this fellow hold you
up a little while ago 

   i believe he did replied the paying-
teller  but it was with a brace of his patent
pistol-pattern cologne atomizers

    and there was no robbery   asked
jailem

  no replied the paying-teller van
was simply cashing a check

      well sir said jailem  i hope you will

excuse us this amateur broke in on our
privacy and told us vandyke red was up
here the laugh is on us good-day

     say pardner said dirk addressing the
vandyke individual  you dont happen to
have a ticket to pittsburgh in your clothes
im beginning to think new york is too
strenuous for an humble bridge-worker
well replied that individual as the
laugh is on you i dont see any objection to
staking you back to your native heath the
temptations of a great city are too much for
a man of your heroic mold

  dirk got the ticket all right and took
the next train home i havent seen him
since

  i suppose said curran that is an-
other of that  makers of history  series of
vours what is the lesson im to learn from
it

  the moral said dugan is dont
jump into a seventh-story window to catch a
highwayman stick to terry-firma

the smallest engine in the world

                             from the philadelphia times 

an incident happened in machinery hall yester-
day afternoon which is well worth record-
ing as it exhibits the unparalleled advancement of
american genius in small as well as i great things

  while a large throng of visitors from all coun-
tries were standing silently around the mighty cor-
liss engine watching its gigantic movements with
feelings partly of delight and partly of awe a tall
gentlemanly looking personage who afterward gave
his name and address as levi taylor of indianola
iowa joined the crowd and with the others paid
unspoken yet eloquent homage to the wondrous
monster before him

  after watching the motions for a few moments
the gentleman passed around to one side and ex-
tracting from his pocket a small tin case took from
it what looked like a diminutive alcohol lamp
and striking a match started a miniature flame and
placed the contrivance on a corner of the platform
which surrounds the mighty steam giant from
rhode island

  at first glance nothing could be discerned over
this lamp but a small excrescence which looked

more like a very juvenile humming-bird than any-
thing else but a close inspection showed that what
was mistaken for liliputian wings was the fly-wheel
of a perfect steam-engine and persons with extra
good eyes could after a close examination discover
some of the other parts of the curious piece of
mechanism

  this engine has for its foundation a twenty-
five-cent gold-piece and many of its parts are so
tiny that they cannot be seen without a magnify-
ing-glass it has -the regular steam-gage ard
though complete in every particular the entire ap-
paratus weighs only seven grains while ihe engi-e
proper weighs but three grains

  ii is made of gold steel and platinum the
fly-wheel is only three-fourths of an inch in
diameter the stroke is one-twenty-fourth of an
inch and the cut-off one-sixty-fourth of an inch

  the machinery which can all be taken apart
was packed in films of silk it is to be hoped that
this wonderful piece of work is to be placed on ex-
hibition alongside of its grand antithesis but it is
now probably too late to make an entry

a record in track laying

without delaying the schedule and in just
 minutes and  seconds  feet of
-pound rails weighing  pounds were re-
placed by  pounds of -pound rails this
was on the lake shore and northern railroad
in syracuse new york near the syracuse railroad
junction bridge where the interurban also uses the

tracks the rails to be put in place were bonded
together and placed beside the rails to be re-
moved

  the crew began work at  am and finished
at  am during which time  tons of steel
rails were handled and a remarkable record estab-
lished in track laying-popular electricity

dered distribute the ferns there and
spraddle those flowers all over the place
wherever you like

  then the road-foreman of engines showed
the sisters and brothers where to hang the
silver bells choosing the largest bell of all
to hang over the table in the dining-room
on which table stood a mammoth wedding-
cake streamers of silver ribbons were criss-
crossed from side to side of the dining-room
with a wedding present at the end of each
ribbon

  at nine oclock engineer jack knowlton
and sister knowlton and their daughter
mounted the porch and let themselves into
their domicile the place was dark and
still just as a home should be at nine
olock at night in decatur illinois but
the moment the knowltons closed the front
door electricity illumined every room in the
house from kitchen to guest-chamber

a complete surprise

  in their parlor brother and sister knowl-
ton beheld half a hundred friends sitting at
tables playing cards everywhere were sil-
ver-ribbon streamers and silver bells while
in one comer stood a table filled with silver
articles that looked mighty like wedding
presents

  the special official present from the sis-
ters as a lodge was a silver candelabra of
great beauty when sister spence in a felici-
tous speech presented jack knowlton per-
sonally with the candelabra jack tried his
best to answer

  he began speaking then choked back
something that got in his throat then began
again stopped short again and then-he
beat it for dear life out of the house to the
back porch where he spent some time making
astronomical observations

  while jack knowlton was star-gazing
brother law road-foreman of engines stand-
ing in the doorway of the dining-room spoke
up so all the guests could hear him

   it takes a whole lot to down tack knowl-
ton-and this whole lot has done it hes
sure downed

the bryan of the rails

  jack knowlton however presently re-
turned to the banquet-hall with determina-
tion written on his countenance manifestly
he had resolved to make a speech thanking
the donors for the candelabra

taking his place at the table and with his

eyes roving from the candelabra to the big
wedding-cake he began as he had begun be-
fore

  my friends i-

  silence reigned intense for all the guests
now felt sure that jack was going to orate
with a vehemence of steam escaping from an
engine

  to jack however that silence was terri-
ble

  my friends i- he began again then
stopped short with his eyes fixed upon the
wedding-cake till suddenly he cried

  my friends- i-well wheres the cow

  his question so unexpectedly asked was
greeted by tremendous laughter and applause
which lasted so long that jack sat down let-
ting it be known that he had finished his
speech having said all there was to say
namely wheres the cow

  thereon hangs a tale

  one night some months previous to the
silver wedding engineer knowltons wife
went down-town to attend a regular meeting
of her order she left behind her the fol-
lowing first a husband fast asleep after an
extra run second a daughter wide-awake in
anticipation of the coming of a nice young
engineer who always called on wednesday
evening third a cow in the back yard

saw the cow jump

  presently the wide-awake daughter saw the
cow jump the front fence and run down the
road out of the house the daughter tore
bent upon capturing that bovine and bringing
it home

  to accomplish her purpose she screamed
at the top of her voice till the whole neigh-
borhood responded and a terrible hullabaloo
ensued during which that nice young engi-
neer turned the corner and supposing that
at least one whole block of houses was in
flames promptly turned in an alarm

  through that neighborhood with clang of
bells and thunder of hoofs and shriek of
whistles swooped the fire department the
fireman having nothing else to do proceeded
to capture the cow and return her to jack
knowltons front yard

  just then jack knowlton awakened from
profound slumber by the racket outside
thrust his head out of the window and in-
quired of the fire department

  whats all the fuss about

   your cow mr knowlton some one for-
got to do the milking to-night and she
sneaked out and told the whole population
daughters of the rail



of decatur all about it thats all you bet-
ter come down right now with your milk-
maids stool mr knowlton and show that
cow how sorry you are that folks neglected
her

  wheres your mother   thundered
knowlton addressing his daughter

   shes at the lodge father

  she is is she well confound it ill
get that lodge to excuse her from attending
meetings till further notice

at the meeting

  when the sisters lodge again found them-
selves  in congress assembled up rose the
secretary and read a letter from brother john
knowlton in which he asserted that the peace
of his domicile had been greatly disturbed
by the absence of his wife at the lodge and
asked that she be excused from further at-
tendance at the meetings especially meetings
held at night

   all in favor of excusing sister knowlton
as requested say  aye  cried the president
of the lodge sister cowles  contrary
no there being no ayes and all
 noes sister knowlton is not excused and
the secretary is directed to answer brother
knowltons communication accordingly
well fix him said sister cowles after
the meeting had adjourned next monday
is his birthday well fix him

  the following monday evening jack
knowlton and a number of other brothers
were invited to come to the lodge and meet
the sisters to pass a few social hours

  when all were assembled knowlton was
lured to a place in the middle of the room

a door leading into the kitchen was opened
and out walked four sisters bearing a huge
birthday-cake set around with nearly fifty
lighted candles

  they set the cake on the table by jack
knowlton and then suddenly one of the
sisters produced a toy cow nearly as big as
a small calf stood it on the frosted cake
and cried

   its milking-time mr knowlton 

  wake up cried the president sister 
cowles the cows jumped the fence
fire called another sister the fire
departments coming and you better jump
for your life

    wheres my wife   shouted still another
sister

   at the lodge  answered a number of
sisters in chorus

  then expel her and let her stay home

  and milk the cow and maintain peace in my
house while i sleep cried the secretary

  these remarks were hurled at jack knowl-
ton amid the most hilarious doings on the
part of the auxiliary sisters-with moo-ing in
imitation of the voice of the cud-chewing
kine mingled with cries of  scotlands burn-
ing fire fire and its your birth-
day jack knowlton dont look so glum
till finally the poor defeated engineer cried

   stung

   then he turned to his wife to say  at-
tend all the lodge meetings you like little
girl i wont say another word-

  thats why on the night of his silver
wedding when he tried to make a speech
jack knowlton stared at the big wedding-
cake and cried reminiscently wheres the
cow

going broke

  let me tell you how all the railroad girls
of hannibal missouri went broke through
laying wagers on the wrong fat man in a
marathon race

  so said an old engineer and brotherhood
man while he and i were crossing the mis-
sissippi river on the ferry-boat running be-
tween east st louis and real st louis

  the race was run up here at canton
missouri the veteran railroader continued
where the mark twain division of the
brotherhood of locomotive engineers of
hannibal was holding a picnic

   the boys were treating themselves to a
days outing haying chartered the steam
packet w w to carry them the thirty-five
miles up the mississippi river from han-
nibal to canton

  with the boys of course were their
wives and sisters and sweethearts and a
mother or two-these ladies you understand
being mostly members of the auxiliary or
what you might call the female annex of the
local lodge of the b l e

   in general charge of the days ceremonies
was an engineer named tankard well sir
what does tankard do when they reach the
picnic-grounds but whisper a word in the
ear of several of the sisters who immediately
show that they catch on by opening up on
all and sundry with a proposition for a bit
of fun

    we suggest one of the ladies said
speaking for all the sisters  that the fat
men of the party run a marathon race

  good thing shouted all the living
skeletons in the crowd  here you brother


the railroad mans magazine

dowd and you brother houser the ladies
want to know which of you can run the
fastest

two of the heaviest

   dowd and houser were two of the heav-
iest engineers in the bunch there were other
fat men of course but dowd and houser
were the limit

  well dowd and houser consented to
enter the race along with the lesser obese
ones they shouted

    whats the matter with letting con-
ductor dooley into this marathon  

   the conductor referred to was an o
r c man and a bully good fellow he
weighs about as much as president taft
however and was many pounds heavier than
any engineer on the premises

   everybody laughed especially the ladies
at the idea of conductor dooley running a
marathon but dooley didnt seem to mind
any of the remarks derisive or miscellaneous

  what he did was just to keep mum till
the ladies had urged him good and hard to
enter the race and then seemingly with re-
luctance he allowed hed take a try at the
running

   alongside of the fat conductor the two
fattest engineers looked positively emaciated
the consequence being that every blamed bet
made in that camp by both brothers and sis-
ters was placed on one or the other of the
engineers

   at the same time conductor dooley went
quietly through the crowd laying bets with
each and even- gent who would listen to
him betting every cent he possessed on his
own fleet-footedness

theyre off

  when all was ready engineer tank-
ard gave the word

  away the fatties started on a run did
the fat conductor make any showing at all
well say alongside of the engineers he
looked like a catamaran alongside a lot of
canoes-but all the same he pulled ahead
of the engineers from the very start left them
way behind and finished the marathon in a
walk

  you never heard such howling in all
your life every man and woman present
had lost money all having bet as i have
said on the engineers

   conductor dooley boarded the steam
packet for the return trip to hannibal with
about all the money there was in that crowd

   on the way down the mississippi doo-
ley mounted a bench and addressed thos
who had gone dead broke on the fat mans
race saying

  ladies and gentlemen never judge a
fat mans running-gear by his weight i
happen to be the champion runner of the
fat mens club of the o r c the trouble
with you-all is that you didnt know what
ive just told you therefore friends ive got
the money and you-all are broke

  now i see some of you are looking
sore some of the ladies in particular but
next time you make bets on a fat mans race
ladies you lay your dough on the fattest
man in the running and you will win money
instead of losing it

     but mr dooley called out one of the
auxiliaries  you havent hit the nail on the
head were not hurt at losing our money
what makes us feel so bad is that a lot of
able-bodied engineers should be beaten so
ignominiously by a conductor

dave jaspers run

  engineer david jasper had been running
the fast mail on the missouri and north
arkansas railroad for years and had never
met with an accident proud of his good
luck he often spoke of it

  knock on wood dave cautioned a fel-
low-engineman one morning after jasper had
referred to his splendid record

   dave to oblige his superstitious friend
knocked on the brier bowl of his pipe after
which he climbed into his engine to take
the fast mail out of joplin missouri and
down as far as leslie arkansas a run of
one hundred and ninety miles

  at about the half-way point of his run
dave jasper would pull through eureka
springs an arkansas health resort just over
the missouri line at eureka springs were
the general offices of the railroad company
and just a little north of the resort lived-
miss dora jasper

   yes i am obliged right here to change the
scene of action to doras territory in order
that the meeting of dora jasper and david
jasper may be understood

trouble in the distance

  it was that same morning when dave jes-
per knocked wood and then pulled out of
joplin dora a farmers daughter up early
and having finished her chores went for a
stroll along the right-of-way of the missouri
daughters of the rail



and north arkansas railroad near the
tracks of which she lived

  a freight-train rumbled by and dora
watched it as it rolled over the long trestle
a little way down the line

  sparks were flying from the locomotive
dora thought she saw smoke coming up from
the trestle in curiosity she ran down the
track and arriving at the northern end of
the trestle she found not only smoke but
flames too shooting up from the wooden
structure

   the trestle was on fire

   so swiftly did the timbers burn that dora
became appalled

    the mail train will be here in less than
half an hour she murmured in alarm
what shall i do

  she thought a moment then started on
a run toward her fathers barn the only
horse in the barn was a half-broken colt all
the other horses having been taken by her
father and the hired men that morning to
work in a distant field

  the only thing for dora to do was to
use the half-broken colt she untied him
and vaulted to his back riding bareback
and with only a rope for a bridle she kicked
the horse in the ribs and made him dash
out of the yard and down the railroad

  then up the right-of-way she rushed on-
ward thinking that if she rode about one
mile up the track it would be far enough
from the burning trestle to warn the engi-
neer of the fast mail and enable him to
stop his train in time she urged the horse
on and on

on a runaway

  when she thought she had ridden some-
thing over a mile she pulled on her rope
bridle trying to stop the colt the animal
however plunged forward at a terrible pace

   hes running away she said to her-
self quite calmly

  she decided however that if only she
could keep him on or near the right-of-way
all would be well on the other hand if
the runaway swerved and dashed off over
the adjacent hills her attempt to warn the
mail train would have been all in vain

   trusting to luck she clung to the colts
back till she had covered a second mile
when she heard a locomotive whistle

    thats the train coming now  she told
herself oh dick good dick was her
prayer to the horse  please dont leave the
track

  on and on the beast tore tillnearly the
third mile was covered and she came within
sight of the station at gaskins-three miles
from eureka springs

  the fast mail was now in sight one
moment more and the train would shoot past
her would the engineer heed her warning

  what could she do to make sure that the
man in the engine would pay attention when
she waved her hand to him

  her hand that was all she had to wave
most heroines who save trains possess red
tablecloths or red sweaters or red petticoats
but dora jasper had onlyher hand for a
signal

her only signal

  up the track sped the colt and down the
track rushed the train dora raised one hand
frantically while with the other she clung to
the mane of the horse

  the engineer saw her he heeded too not
because he thought she was trying to stop
his train but because he supposed she was
waving for help as it was obvious that her
mount was running away

  engineer david jasper for it was he
brought his train to a standstill then began
backing he backed faster and faster till
finally he overtook the girl on the horse

  after shooting by her he slowed down
then jumped from his engine ran back met
the flying colt seized the rope halter and-
stopped the runaway

 oh  cried dora  im so glad 

  there little gal cried dave jasper
youre all safe now good-by i mustnt
stop another minute

no no come back screamed dora

  thats all right little gal you can
thank me some time when i aint in a hurry
the engineer hastened on toward his engine

  no no wait cried dora the
runaway was nothing at all i didnt mind
that the trestle down near eureka is
burning	

her best reward

  whats that yelled dave jasper turn-
ing in his tracks to look back at the girl as
she jumped from the colts back

  in two minutes dora had explained the
situation to the amazed engineer mean-
time the passengers and crew had gathered
round

  whats your name little gal asked the
engineer


the railroad mans magazine

   dora jasper 

jasper why then were of the same
family dora im a jasper too shake
hats off to the jasper family  cried the
railway mail clerk who had suggested pass-
ing the hat

   but vou should accept some sort of re-
ward little gal insisted dave tell you
what he added  ill see that youre made
an auxiliary lady do you see ill get the
ladies of our auxiliary at eureka springs to
make you an honorary member

  dora listened to this with open mouth
and expressionless face she was not over-
whelmed by the reward

   why whats the matter gal   asked
dave aint it enough you want some-
thing more

   tell you what replied dora  id like
you to carry me back to eureka on your
engine mr jasper will you

   hop up there  promptly answered
dave

  thus dora jasper got the greatest wish
of her life-a ride on an engine when the
train arrived at the gorge where early that
morning the freight had crossed on a trestle
there was now no trestle at all only a black-
ened mass of smoking timbers

  as dave jasper walked back to the fast
mail which dora jaspers bareback ride had
saved from a plunge into the gorge he said
thoughtfully

   its good i knocked on wood this morn-
ing

  dora walking by the engineers side now
said

  mr jasper what-all was that honorable
thing im going to be made into by the
engineer ladies at eureka springs

    an auxiliary

   and what-all happens to me when im
that mr jasper

  why girl youll be invited to parties
and the ladies will pass you the lemonade
and cake and ice-cream youll be invited
to picnics daytimes and you can attend
lodge meetings and take part in the dance
afterward and none of these things will
cost you a cent being an honorary auxiliary
lady wont be assessed at all

two railroad men

  the story involves two firemen of little
rock arkansas

  one of the men was long kowle
bachelor with a hundred in the bank

  the other was jerry jenhower husband

and father with almost nothing at all saved
up and stowed in an ancient oil-can away at
the back of the shelf in the kitchen pantry

  one day both firemen were notified that
the road was cutting down the force out of
little rock and that one or the other would
have to go thus neither of them was di-
rectly laid off simply it was put up to them
to decide which should be the one to quit

  long kowle the bachelor with cash in
bank met a woman on his way home that
evening to whom he said pleasantly

   good evening

  she was the wife of jerry jenhower
kowles comrade

   long  looked at her sharply and noted
traces of tears in her face

  when he moved on that tear-stained face
was still right in front of  longs  eyes
all night the sad face of jenhowers wife
haunted long and when morning came
he made a resolution he scribbled a note
hurried with it to the roundhouse handed
it to the foreman then went straight over to
j enhowers house

  he found jerry just sitting down to the
breakfast which his wife had prepared
their little daughter sat at the table too
absorbed in a dish of oatmeal

   how do everybody said  long 
kowle cheerily

   how do kowle replied jerry gravely
well this is the day either you or i
must go to-day long suppose we draw
lots ill take two straws from that whisk-
broom over there one long and one short
and the one that draws the shortest must-

  hold up jerry interrupted long
youre a few minutes late ive already
resigned i reckon im in better shape to go
job-hunting than you are my boy so you
put on your sleeve-guards and go to it

  the two men shook hands in silence and
in silence long kowle left the house

  jerry jenhower benedict and father found
that he couldnt finish his breakfast some-
thing in his throat gave him a choking sen-
sation and he seized his sleeve-guards and
his cap and left the place

  meantime the wife the member of the
ladies auxiliary of the firemens brotherhood
of little rock stood in her doorway and
looked down the street at her disappearing
husband with a smile on her lips and a sin-
gularly bright look in her eyes

  then she looked up street at the retreat-
ing figure of long kowle and said

  long youre the best railroad man in
arkansas
 getting ben kilpatrick

by chauncey thomas

the true story series in the following story is related
the dramatic capture of one of the most picturesque and daring characters
that ever practised the grim pastime of train-robbery kilpatrick was one
of the class of men who took desperate chances-and any man who suddenly
finds himself in the possession of thousands of dollars worth of new and unsigned
national bank bills is taking the most desperate chance of all when he tries to pass
them the gang with which kilpatrick worked was one of the most daring that
ever operated in the west and many a railroader will remember them

true story number fifty

an innocent pawnbroker took one of the unsigned bank bills in payment
for a watch then an eagle-eyed bank clerk and the
st louis police did the rest

ne november night something
over ten years ago a great
northern passenger - train was
held up by five or six men and
among other plunder from the
express safe the robbers took
thirty-two thousand dollars in unsigned bills
of the helena national bank by daylight
next morning the sheriff with a strong posse
and a number of railroad and express de-
tectives were on the ground large rewards
were at once posted and the chase began

  the trail led south across the frozen prai-
rie but was lost near the state-line just
who the robbers were was not known at first
but good work in locating all possible sus-
pects centered suspicion almost to a certainty
on what was then known as black jacks
gang of frontier desperadoes among whom
was black jack himself harry longbaugh

bill carver ben kilpatrick and several
others

  the pinkertons also had the case and
sent out hundreds of circulars giving a de-
scription of the suspected men unfortu-
nately only one photograph could be ob-
tained-that of harry longbaugh the cir-
culars read in large type

   dangerous these men are desperate
criminals they go heavily armed at all
times and are crack shots take no chances
with them as they will shoot to kill

the teller is surprised

   one of these circulars was posted in police
headquarters at st louis a year after the
robbery

   the affair was almost forgotten when sud-
denly four of the unsigned bills appeared at

the receiving-tellers cage of one of the st
louis banks

   as the receiving-teller checked up the de-
posit-slip of a certain pawnbroker he gave a
low whistle hurriedly he left his cage and
went to the cashiers office

  here are four of those helena national
bills stolen from the great northern a year
ago- they just came in he told the cashier

  the cashier glanced at the bills they
were apparently colored by use and signed
all right but a moments investigation
showed that the coloring was due to the bills
being dipped in cold black tea and that the
names signed were not the same as the offi-
cials of the helena national bank at once
he called up the united states marshals
office

  hallo we have just taken in four of
those helena national unsigned bills-the
ones stolen in the great northern hold-up

   do you know who passed them   inter-
rupted the marshal

  yes we got them from a certain pawn-
broker just came in ten minutes ago

    ill be right over answered the united
states officer in five minutes he had the
bills in another ten minutes with several
deputies he stood in the pawnbrokers shop

  where did you get these bills he
asked the frightened pawnbroker

  a large dark man six foot tall came in
here about an hour ago and bought a ladys
solid gold watch for one hundred dollars
he gave me five twenties for it and those
bills were four of them i guess i didnt
look at them especially because all money
lopks alike to me arent they good he
asked anxiously as he realized that he stood
to lose eighty dollars if the bills were bad

picking up a clue

   rapid questioning soon convinced the offi-
cers that the pawnbroker was innocent he
was well known in st louis and bore an
excellent reputation then the hunt began
for the large dark man

  the st louis police were at once noti-
fied and in another hour even- available
officer in st louis was  duty till re-
lieved all  were alive to catch the man
who had bought the watch and possibly the
five thousand dollars reward for one of the
cane that held up the great northern train

  the pawnbroker was shown the circulars
and picked out the picture of harry long-
baugh as that of the man who had bought
the watch

  well have mr longbaugh if hes in
town yet said chief of detectives desmond
-big bill desmond he was called-to
the marshal

  now you men scatter all over the ten-
derloin and keep your eyes peeled dont
take any chances of arresting him single-
handed no grand-stand business remem-
ber if you try it some of you will get killed
and we dont want him to get away if you
see anything of him notify headquarters at
once and call as many men together as you
can before taking him now get busy

  and they did

  a guion one of the detectives was stand-
ing on a street corner about nine oclock
when a carriage went by in which was one
man he could not see him very well but
from a glance he thought the man was large
and dark he followed the carriage on foot
till it stopped a block up the street at a cer-
tain resort

  the man left the carriage and entered the
place

chasing the carriage

  before guion could get to the carriage the
man came out of the resort and was driven
rapidly another block to a corner saloon
which he and the driver entered guion fol-
lowed them inside standing at the bar
playfully feeding the free lunch to a stray
dog stood harry longbaugh

  guion was unarmed so he left the place
quietly and looked around to locate some of
the other men one was in sight a block
down the street but was not looking guions
way and guion dared not make any suspi-
cious motions or longbaugh would get sus-
picious and make his escape probably shoot-
ing as he went if necessary just then guion
heard the bartender inside say

   youd better be careful how you flash
that roll of twenties down here friend you
are liable to be held up

  they wont hold me up longbaugh
laughed quietly as he left the saloon for the
carriage he was driven to another resort
which he entered leaving the driver outside

  meanwhile guion had caught the eye of
the other detective and had sent him on a
hurry call to gather in some of their col-
leagues in a few minutes five officers stood
 the sidewalk before the resort

  they looked at each other for in another
minute some of them would probably be
dead then they entered the front door in
the hall they asked for the man who had
just come in not wanting any trouble the
getting ben kilpatrick



proprietor tried to bluff the officers he
laughingly said

   oh hes all right gentlemen i know
him he assured the officers

guion was game

  guion stumbled against the door of a
gambling-room and threw it open he stag-
gered half-across the room as if falling then
leaped into the air and landed with his knees
in the pit of harry longbaughs stomach

  longbaugh was seated in a chair and be-
fore he was awaje guion dived into his
breast-pocket whipped out a hammerless re-
volver and stuck it in longbaughs face

   dont move or ill kill you he said
quietly in the next instant the other offi-
cers had longbaugh handcuffed

   g-r-r-r-r-r- came in a hoarse guttural
from longbaughs set teeth while his eyes
fairly glowed green he did not attempt to
move from his hip-pocket the officers took
another gun a  single-action that may be
seen to-day in the historic collection of noted
frms in st louis police headquarters

  then the prisoner like a chained grizzly
was led to the patrol-wagon which had been
summoned with more police no one knew
what minute others of the desperate gang
might appear and begin to shoot so no
chances were taken

  a quick dash put the patrol-wagon and
its load of jubilant officers with their silent
dangerous prisoner before the door of chief
desmonds office in the four courts building

  with a pair of nippers on each wrist and
with two officers behind holding drawn guns
the hold-up was escorted to the office he
was as gentle as a lamb now but his eves
were like a hawks large gray with great
black pupils they took in everything from
the doors to the windows back to the men
around him then suddenly blazed as they
glanced for a fleeting instant toward a corner
of the room

a forgotten gun

  that glance was so vivid that the officers
turned instinctively on a small table in
the corner was a large revolver which some
officer had carelessly laid down and forgot-
ten three officers made a jump for the gun
while the others stepped between it and the
prisoner

  well longbaugh the games up any
one else here with you asked desmond
pleasantly the prisoner did not reply he

did not even look at his questioner he ap-
peared to be very disinterested

   hell get over that when hes had time
to cool off and think it over said desmond
 put him in  the holdover and allow no
one to see him or speak to him-not even any
of the police remember the chief added
so they led him down-stairs and placed him
in a dark cell

  then began ten days of as hard a game of
sweating the truth out of a prisoner as
desmond ever knew at the end of that
time the chief had learned nothing whatever
he did not even know if the man he had
was harrj- longbaugh or one of the kil-
patrick brothers

  among the articles found on the prisoner
was a small note-book on one page of which
was written certain letters that corresponded
with the initials of various members of the
gang the note-book contained some figures
too that seemed to be the amount of money
each of the gang had received from the hold-
up a brass key that looked like a hotel
key was also found on the prisoner des-
mond took it in his hand and studied it for
a moment

fitting the key

   here take this and see if you can find
a lock in st louis to fit it he hasnt that
ladys gold watch on him so there is probably
a woman in the case somewhere and we want
her before she has a chance to get away she
doesnt know he is arrested yet so she is
still here and will probably stay all night
but when the papers come out in the morning
shell know all about the arrest now get
busy

  two of the men began a tour of the hotels
and rooming houses for the lock that that
key fitted

  he has less than three hundred dollars
of the stolen money on him and youll prob-
ably find it with that key said desmond

  about ten oclock next morning the day
clerk of the wandull hotel recalled something
he had forgotten

   yes come to think of it there is a large
dark man stopping here came two days
ago acted rather queer too come to think
of it kept to his room and had all his
meals sent up to him there is a friend of
his a woman who also has a room here

   here she comes now said the clerk
suddenly

  i want to pay my bill call a carriage
please immediately i want to catch the ten-


the railroad mans magazine

twenty - five train and have barely time
please have my trunk brought down imme-
diately she said to the clerk while the of-
ficers loafed within ear-shot

  shall we take her whispered one of
them

the woman who knew

   dont like to without knowing more
about her she niay be all right and that
wouldnt do desmond would find fault
im afraid you watch her and ill slip up
to her room and try this key if it fits shes
our meat

  while the woman sat in the waiting-room
for her trunk and carriage one of the of-
ficers ran up to the third floor and tried
the key in the lock it fitted

  take her he muttered to his mate as
he reached the ground floor  shes the
one

   the officer touched her on the arm

  madam i am sorry to trouble you but
duty forces me to put you under arrest 

   sir  how dare you what do you
mean she blazed but her bluff did not
work

  the officers then and there opened her
hand valise it contained several bundles of
helena national bank bills all unsigned

   come with us they said she broke
down and cried but would say nothing

   ah sit down beamed desmond when
the officers led her into the chiefs private
office

  the woman remained silent to all ques-
tions

    put her in the  holdover  ordered des-
mond and he turned to examine the contents
of the trunk and the handbags now being
taken from the patrol wagon

recovering the coin

  the trunk contained nothing out of the
ordinary but the handbag rolled out many
of the long missing bills from the great
northern robbery after counting it was dis-
covered that only si of the missing
 was accounted for the balance
of the plunder some si was with the
rest of the gang and it is understood has
never been recovered with the exception of a
few stray bills that the gang managed to
pass here and there

  it was a tiresome job to get longbaugh
and the woman to talk and nothing came
of it all that was learned after ten days
was this

   chief if youll let up on me ill teh
you who i am said the man prisoner worn
out by a steady stream of questions-often
for twenty-three hours a day-from one man
desmond

  all right who are you agreed des-
mond and he never broke his word once it
was given to a prisoner

  i am ben kilpatrick that is all
any one ever did get from either of them

  ben kilpatrick he was and not harry
longbaugh after he was asleep on the
hard bench in his narrow dismal cell des-
mond wiped his weary forehead and said

   ben kilpatrick is the most remarkable
prisoner arrested in st louis in the past
eighteen years he is a man of iron i
never saw such a man he is too dangerous
a man to be at large

a legal problem

  then came up a new problem what were
the prisoners to be charged with before the
united states court it was openly said
that a good lawyer could easily get both
clear there was practically no evidence- to
prove that kilpatrick had helped to hold up
the train he could not be charged with
passing counterfeit money as the money had
been made by the united states government
nor could it be legally proven that this
money had come into kilpatricks possession
otherwise than as the woman declared
through gambling

  here was a pretty mess of fish every
one knew to a dead certainty that ben kil-
patrick was one of the great northern train
robbers but knowing a thing and legally
proving it are two widely different things

  however kilpatrick had nothing except
the stolen money and at the very last mo-
ment his lawyers withdrew from the case be-
cause they could not get the fee they asked

  kilpatrick was charged with enough
crimes to send him up for life if convicted
so he pleaded guilty to one charge and was
sentenced to eighteen years in the federal
prison

  the woman got five years the rest of
the gang were either killed off in the west
or escaped to the argentine republic where
some of them are said to be to-dav bill
carver one of the gang was shot and
 black jack the leader of the gang was
hanged in new mexico a few years later

  ry an odd coincidence ben kilpatrick
and harry longbaugh looked enough alike
to be twins

            fate handed bellows a bunch of trouble starting an
            undress parade and breaking up a love affair

f-v he time was a broiling-hot mid- sooner or later i knew that it would be pro-
fliljiiil afternoon in early august the ductive of speech providing always that no
dlllllullliiiiwuk place was the coolest in all the extraneous event occurred to mar the thread
rop i	sun-baked blistered town of of his thoughts in the meantime the cigars

iiji lj east hartford namely in the were good the shade exceedingly grateful
shadow cast by the old water- after the dust and heat of the town proper
tank that reared a spidery-girded and riveted and his reminiscences were decidedly worth
structure closte by the river side of the

midland roundhouse	n

the man was old sam bellows bet-	

ter known among the other men on the	

division as bellerin sam not because
of any propensity on his part for vocal
gymnastics of extraordinary magnitude
as the sobriquet would seem to imply
but because as windy anderson its
originator stated  sam bellers bel-
lerin sam-what better do yuh want
huh

so bellerin sam he became and bel-
lerin sam he remains though the au-
thor of the misfitted nickname has long
since vanished from the ken of the mid-
land gone to pastures new where the
rails stretch their shining lengths over
alkali prairies and cactus-studded des-
erts and where the scarcity of men
causes the master mechanics to welcome
the  boomer  and railroad outcast
with open arms regardless of past rec-
ords

but to return to sam and the shade
of the water-tank

 by gee sir he remarked  im
glad its my day off running an en-
gine especially on a way-freight a day
like this is the nearest approach to pur-
gatory were liable to butt up against
before we make an acquaintance with
the real article

after voicing this opinion sam re-
lapsed into a deep meditation that i
took pains not to disturb for some time

 rr	


the railroad mans magazine

waiting for this day however they seemed
to take longer than usual to crystallize into
speech and i finally became impatient

   some say i remarked by way of a start-
er that purgatory is cold instead of hot

   anyway cold or hot we get a good imi-
tation here on this road he retorted

  why i shouldnt think the cold would
bother you fellows in the cab any you
look said i surveying his huge figure as
though you had fat enough to keep you warm
through a greenland winter without bother-
ing with any clothes

   i do huh  well just you try running
around a strange town with the thermometer
at fifteen below and nothin on but your skin
and a union suit and see how you like it

   tell me about it i requested passing
over another hvo-for-a-quarter

   it happened back in ninety-five he be-
gan between puffs fourteen years makes
a lot of difference in a man and i was a hot
sport in them days id been running about
eight months then

   that was when the compounds first made
their appearance and i had one for a regular
engine the  she was shes the 
and a simple engine now they changed her
over after terry bains father had the mix-
up with her-in milton sag

  a cross-compound she was when i had
her and a dandy piece of machinery as far
as actual use goes rfow shes a cross between
a rubber boot and an ash-barrel and cant
run as fast as i can wont make steam
enough to blow the whistle louder than the
ones they have on these peanut machines and
you couldnt keep water in her with a nine-
teen-inch injector but she was a regular
ball of fire when i had her on the fast freight

  we cut off three and four hours every
day from the regular running - time and
instead of arriving in huntsville at  pm
we kept getting in at five-thirty and six
oclock every day great engine she was but
she was the means of losing me a corkin
good run with her fast going

   yes sir that getting into huntsville
at six oclock queered me proper that and
my being such a hot sport and so keen after
the women folks

   when i first took the job they had an
old simple mogul on there she was heavy
enough to make the time had she been in any
kind of shape but between a valve motion
that caused her to limp like a man with a
wooden leg and a knack she had of going
along like a hop-toad one minute on her
springs and the next down hard on her

frames with a jolt that would fairly loosen
your eye-teeth and put crooks in your back-
bone she was a tough proposition and i
hollered for another hog every time i
reached the roundhouse

   but my kickin didnt do me any good
till i began to drop a minute here and there
in the rough spots owing to easing off on
her so i could keep my insides in their proper
place

  then they gave me the  and man
how we used to burn up the rails getting over
the road it wasnt long before the despatcher
got wise to what kind of an engine he was
issuing orders for and to help us out hed
run us extra from branchville and instead
of going to bed when i got in i began to
look for adventures-

  well it wasnt long before i became ac-
quainted and i took in the dances one after
another and the occasional vaudeville shows
that hit the town for one-night stands i
think it was the third dance that i went to
that i became acquainted with the girl in
the case

  she was the one that helped the  out
in losing me that fly run but i dont want
you to think that she was the only girl i
became acquainted with-not by a jugful
you see i was a red-hot sport in them days
and i had women tagging around after me
like tabby-cats after a bit of salmon

   but rose audette was the one i cottoned
to most and i reckon if it hadnt been for my
undress parade through the burg id been
foolish enough to have married her

    i even got so bati i used to let the fire-
man take the hog to the roundhouse and id
drop off in the freight-yard and have a bath
and change my clothes in the hack had it
all fixed up with the flagman to have a
roaring hot fire and a big pail of boiling
water in the caboose every time we struck
huntsville the train-crew all lived there
and i usually had the buggy all to myself

  that particular night i had an engage-
ment to take marie to the show i remember
the name of it all right it was  a hot-
foot through huntsville and that was just
what i did with a darn sight more realism
than those actor folks could ever stack up

  we were rather later than usual getting
in owing to a hot-box on the caboose that
bothered us considerably and of course as
it was the hack we couldnt set it out on a
siding but had to monkey around putting
in a new brass and packing it with dope till
it ran cool enough to hit up a forty-mile clip
again
bellerin sams sunday suit



   i met the conductor coming along with a
bundle tinder his arm as i was on my way
back to the rear end

    hey bingham says i  where you
goin with my clothes 

   aint your clothes said he its some
grub for to-morrows dinner jack laid your
clothes out on the locker

    all right said i  but that bundle
looks a whole lot like mine you see i used
to wrap my duds up in paper
to insure their staying clean

   sure enough when i en-
tered the caboose there was my
bundle of clothes reposin nice
and quiet on the locker i
didnt stop to open them but
peeled off my working clothes

   gee what a crash she simply lifted
that van up on one end walloped the center-
pins till they broke off and finally let it
down nice and gentle after a week or so
crossways of the track

   when i came out of my daze there i
sat astraddle a signal oil-can with the bath-
tub turned over my head like a manila hat
and the bundle containing my sunday suit
between my knees i moved around a little

go it bill hollers one

the rest of the advice i
couldnt hear

in a hurry leaving on nothin but my union
suit till i got the water ready because it was
rather chilly in that hack

   i poured the pail of water into a small
bath-tub i had purchased a couple of trips
before and was sitting on the edge of the
locker dabbling one toe into the water and
yanking it out again and swearing because
there wasnt any more cold water in the
plaguy hack to cool it off with when a
switch-engine suddenly got under that ca-
boose like a ton of dynamite

trying to get that bath-tub lifted off and
promptly let out a yell and jumped a foot or
two ahead

 one of my feet had come in contact with
something decidedly hot

 i commenced to smell smoke and when
at last i got out from under the tub i lost no
time in seizing my bundle of clothes and
crawling through the wreck of the doorway
you see the stove had been ripped loose
from its lashings and upset and inside of
two minutes that hack was a roaring furnace
so there was i with my bundle a working
shirt and one shoe that i picked up on the
platform where they had fallen when the
hack up-ended turned loose in the gentle de-
cember breezes with the thermometer register-
ing fifteen

  that was the starter the finish-well
the finish was sure a hot one


the railroad mans magazine

the entire police-force with
their guns drawn commanding
me to come out peaceable

  sara paused in his narrative to throw the
butt of his cigar away and look at his watch

   have another smoke sam said i alive
to the tentative suggestion conveyed by this
proceeding and also a graduate of numerous
former experiences to keep bellows talk-
ing one lias got to supply the tobacco as
a general rule the quality of his reminis-
cences depends upon the grade of the cigars
but the number of smokes given at a time
should never exceed one else will he imme-
diately have a pressing engagement

  well he resumed when he had once
more begun to puff contentedly on the weed
did i ever tell you about how i was bitten
by a dog when i was a kid and how ive
always been scared at the sight of one since 
no said i but what lias that got to
do with your promenading through hunts-
ville in vour union suit

    why simply this
 right alongside that
 track there was a
 switchmans shanty
 a n d t h e switchman
 stationed there had
 the homeliest bow-
 legged  cross-eyed
 mongrel i ever saw
 every one said he
 was harmless but he
 certainly looked ugly
 enough and i had
 just started to dress
 behind a box car-
 had the one shoe on
 and one arm and my
 head through the shirt
 -when along comes
 doggie a galloping on
 three legs-he lost the
 fourth one under a
 freight-car-with his
 m o u t h wide open
 lookin as red and
 hungry as a ship-
 wrecked sailor

   did i wait to
make his acquaint-
ance not sos youd
notice it i grabbed
my bundle and ran
along between a string
of cars with that
beauty dog a tagging
a few yards in the
rear i was as thin
as you are in them
days and i could
sprint along right lively and though i was
handicapped some by reason of only having
one shoe on and the other foot bare the pup
only had one hind leg to push him ahead with
so that it was a pretty evenly matched race

 up the yard we went around the end of
a box car where i lost a good lead owing
to doggies going underneath where i had
to go around we sprinted we would have
had that end of the yard all to ourselves had
i followed my first idea of trying to play
hide-and-seek with that distorted animal ow-
ing to the yard-crews all being down to the
wrecked caboose but he got so big after gain-
ing those three or four feet that i cut across
lots through a back yard and down the main
street

 i was mortally afraid id run into some
woman every minute but the dog at my
heels fairly scared all sense out of me and
bellerin sams sunday suit



sufficed to keep me going at the same lively
clip

  the first block i met no one down to
the end of the second i spied a lonely female
plodding along hanging her head all un-
conscious of the shocking spectacle that was
coming down on her like a runaway locomo-
tive i didnt want to meet her so i dodged
around a corner and down a side street

   how was i to know the belmont hotel
was on that branch or that id butt into a
bunch of actors and actresses coinin out
i did though and it startled me so i lost the
shoe which wasnt laced up anyway you
could have heard them hollering and shriek-
ing half-way to east hartford when they
took in the spectacle

     go it bill  hollers one the rest of
the advice i couldnt hear

  go to blazes i hollers back i did
have wind enough for that though i was
getting pretty well winded and that starched
shirt was near cutting my head off while the
bundle weighed a ton

   the next thing there pops up a bevy of
young fellows and girls mostly girls i
guess they scattered right proper with a
whole bunch of feminine giggles and squeals
taking to the front lawns like ducks to water

    i was pretty tired by that time and look-
ing around everywhere for a friendly hole
to dodge into of course i wasnt embar-
rassed oh no

  well i was about ready to give up and
let that hopping pup get a good feed of my
shins when i spied a small door slightly
opened in the side of a big brick building on
the corner in my rattled condition i didnt
notice that the building was a church and
if i had it wouldnt have made any differ-
ence i made one mad leap and went through
that door like a cyclone

  i went through the door all right but
if id struck a brick wall i couldnt have

stopped any quicker why because i
landed plumb onto the platform in front of
a whole gathering of women y w c a
meeting i guess

   for a minute there was a horrified silence
i can see the leader now a tall angular
woman with spectacles as she turned her
shocked and outraged countenance in my di-
rection

  then pandemonium broke loose but i
cant describe it you see i heard the fore-
feet of that persistent cur strike the steps
back of me and i dropped my bundle and
dove head first into a small cubby-hole un-
der the organ pulling the door to behind me

  for a while i could hear a smothered
commotion in the church proper then all
was still pretty soon some one yanks the
door open and there stood the three consta-
bles comprising the entire police-force of the
town with their guns drawn and each and
every one of them commanding me to come
out peaceable they all had some sort of
garment on their arm enough cloth to cover
an elephant

   i came out all right but what got me-
sam shook his head and pulled meditatively
on his cigar

  yes i interrogated what got you
sam  

   why that pesky dog lay over in a corner
with his sides stuffed out ready to bust and
his head laying over nice and peaceable on
the remains of a hunk of beef you see id
been lugging binghams sunday dinner
around under the mistaken impressionthat
it was my clothes when they were really in
the bundle he carried home with him

   what happened next sam  

   aw whats the use  i couldnt describe
the rest of it if i had the dictionary on my
tongue any more than i had face enough to
go back and see rose after it was all settled
up darn a dog and a compound anyway

              written for  the railroad mans magazine

       ve hashed on every railroad from mex up to b c

        the waitresses in swell hotels aint got anything on me

        i travel oer the country i dont have to pay my fare

        if i take a notion to cross the ocean ill bet i get shipped

                there

its pretty hard work hashing on any railroad line

the hours are long but theres lots of fun when the bunch comes in
       to dine

when the tourists come they swarm the  ring  like bees around a
       hive

but its worth the bustle the hurry and hustle just to know that
       youre alive

with seven sauce-dishes in one hand and orders stacked to your chin

with hot plates burning your good left arm-its sometimes hard to
       grin

but if you are game you can sling the hash and pass on a little jest

 arm work  is our way we cant carry a tray-theres no class to
       that out west

ive fallen in love with cowboys-once i had an indian beau

i didnt leave any trail for him when i felt it was time to go

and i used to be sweet on a hog-head-hes been hard to forget-

it was heart be still evry time i saw bill but theres been no
       tie-up yet

oh im a regular railroad boomer im running myself a race

for my feet get awfully painful when i stay a month in one place

told in the smoker

by richard maxwell winans

more rapid-fire yarns of clever maneuvers repartee and shrewd road
generalship that won big orders and much merriment for
the ever-jovial knights of the grip

the office-seekers special

was shortly after the inauguration
of president taft that harry
lewis who carries a line of stocks
through the west together with
two other traveling-men and my-
self were gathered in the smok-
ing-compartment late one night on a sleeper
bound for washington d c

  every berth in the car was taken to the
last upper and as one of us remarked it
was strictly a stag-party affair for there was
not a woman in the car to break the mon-
otony the make-up of this particular car-
load of human freight attracted my attention
for most of them looked to me like a line of
samples all cut from the same piece of cloth

  after sizing them up pretty carefully and
listening to a few bits of conversation which
in the main they seemed to be trying to
divert to commonplace channels i came to
the conclusion that they belonged to a class of
citizens much in evidence on washington-
bound trains at this season every four years

 it

  after langdon had finished what we had
agreed was to be the last yarn for the night
before retiring i ventured my guess as to
the specific classification of our fellow pas-
sengers

  merkel who carries hose-the kind with
a hole in only one end-offered to bet me the
breakfasts in the diner next morning for the
four of us that i was on the wrong line and
he put it up to me to produce evidence to
the contrary i took him on and agreed to
make good on my conclusions before the
porter should finish making up the berths in
the morning

  it was late and all being shy on sleep we
soon turned in but i didnt yet quite see my
way out on the bet and so i lay awake for
an hour or so thinking it over finally i
connected with an idea i got up and went
over to lewiss berth which was just oppo-
site mine and posted him on the lines i
wanted him to play

  i had the porter give me an early call and
was up before the others were awake at the
first stop i bought a morning paper i then


the railroad mans magazine

came in and woke lewis and the other two
and in doing so managed to create enough
commotion to get the whole car awake

  for a few minutes i made enough noise
rattling and crackling that paper to set every
mans nerves on edge and then in a tone of
surprised discovery i called loudly across the
aisle to my friends

  hey i say lewis wake up here
is the greatest piece of news ever red-hot
from the new administration

  whats that answered lewis follow-
ing the cue i had given him

  why said i in a tone loud enough to
reach either end of the car  its the report
of an order that was issued yesterday by
president taft

  whats the gist of it asked lewis in a
high key of keen interest

  why i continued giving full voice to
my reply  it goes on to say here that presi-
dent taft has issued orders that all incoming
office-seekers should be impartially rounded
up at the railroad station as fast as they
arrive in washington and sent home forth-
with  

  well sir the curtains on nearly every berth
on that car were instantly yanked aside when
a tousled head appeared in the opening and
an excited chorus of strident voices were
shouting wildlv at me just these two words
whats that

   had won the bet

  those fellows had unwittingly proclaimed
their mission to the capital ambassadors
extraordinary on public business relating ex-
clusively to the private interests and benefits
of the perpendicular-pronoun i

  at merkels invitation-and expense-we
filed into the diner we let it be known in-
cidentally that we were hungry to the limit
and the breakfast we ordered on merkel
would have made a veteran chopper in a
logging camp envy our four-ply appetite

  we kept stoking away until we began to
feel that the supply of fried chicken waffles
and maple sirup must be about exhausted
and then with that  peace-on-earth-good-
will-to-men  sort of feeling that comes from
a third cup of steaming coffee we hit the
trail back to the smoking-compartment



 the returned overalls

hphat breakfast said langdon as he
leaned back in his chair with a smile
of happy recollection reminds me of a
dinner on ed hanford in chicago last rea-

son hanford carries a high-grade line of
overalls out of chicago hed been assigned
a new territory in the northwest and just
before starting out he received a -letter from
a would-be customer in a small town up in
minnesota

    the letter was to say that the writer had
been informed that hanford was to cover
that section and that it was desired to place
an order for three hundred pairs of overalls
to be shipped at an early date and asking
ed to make that town as soon as it was
possiblv convenient the letter was signed
c m oldfield

   hanford was so elated by this advance
order as a promise of a good run of sales in
the new territory that he had a special pair of
fancy overalls made that would have done
credit to a broadway tailor and sent out as
a good-will present to the prospective cus-
tomer then he wrote a very chatty letter
some yards long in which he made mention
of some choice cigars and a little something
wet he carried in his grip and closed by
referring to the overalls of which he said
 i pray you accept these as a personal mat-
ter and wear them with my compliments

    i was with him a few days later in his
hotel when he was handed a telegram from
the writer of the letter his face turned red
as he ran his eye over it and he said some-
thing not very ladylike as he handed it to
me to read this is what it said

     gift received and appreciated cannot
wear them however until the styles change
signed caroline margaret oldfield

   but ed wasnt a fellow to go down for
the count for a jolt like that he intimated
that if miss caroline should measure up to his
esthetic ideas as she did in a business way
why hed make her more to him than an
overall customer and he did i received
an invite about a week ago to attend the
wedding ed was not the kind to let a good
thing get by him



they didnt get by

ell he didnt have much on a fellow
i knew chirped in merkel appar-
ently pleased to know he was not the only
mistaken-identity victim

   his name was harry swift too at that
carried a line of boys clothing in the south
he was a wide-awake chap of the never-let-
any-one-get-the-better-of-you class he was
on one of them little jerk-water roads mak-
ing a run from one main line over to another
told in the smoker



   the train stopped at a little wayside tank
to take water and the conductor failed to
send back a flagman presently there came
along the roads crack limited running at
the rate of seven or eight miles an hour and
bumped bang into the rear of the first train

   swift was riding in the smoker with his
back to the engine playing pitch with three
others he was lifted bodily from his seat
and thrown clear across the back of the seat
facing him his hat was smashed down
over his ears and his meerschaum pipe-
cracked into bits he scrambled back into
his seat a little bruised but not badly in-
jured

   then he pried off his lid straightened
up drew a long breath looked around defi-
antly and said  hully gee they made a
big bluff at it but they didnt get by us
anyhow  

gave him his moneys worth

 xhere was frahk haskell put in

  a lewis  he carries a line of patent
belting and his success is largely due to not
letting anything get by him without showing
cause

  when he came fresh from college where
hed played on the football team his sole
asset in the business world was nerve and
sticktoitiveness for hed never earned a red
copper in his life

  when he started after a job he went to
old man brigham the general manager of the
company and nonchalantly told him he
would like to have the exclusive right to a
certain very choice piece of territory old
brigham gasped caught his breath and gave
haskell what he asked for almost before hed
looked him over taken clear off his feet by
the very boldness of the proposition

   after brigham had given him his final
instructions next day he shook hands in a
perfunctory sort of way and smiled sar-
castically as he went out as much as to say

 youll make good i dont think 

  but he did and here is one illustration
of how he did it he located one of the first
prospective customers hed  lined up  for a
sale in his exclusive and palatial private
office one morning he gave his card to the
office-boy and buried himself in a big leather
chair to await the lads return from where
he sat he could see the manager through
the plain beveled edge of the ground-glass
partition and he saw him give the card a
casual glance tear it in bits and drop it in
the waste-basket

    that got on haskells nerves and so
when the office-boy came back with the old
story that the manager was very sorry but
could not see mr haskell that morning he
promptly sent the boy back with the request
that the manager return the card to him
which he had seen torn up

  the youngster returned in a jiffy and
handed haskell a nickel with the remark
that the manager had mislaid the card but
that if it was so valuable perhaps the nickel
would cover the damages

   but haskell wasnt done yet taking
another card from his case he scratched a
line on it slipped the boy a quarter and had
his card again laid on the managers desk
beside the name he now read thereon these
words

     these cards are two for a nickel

    haskell got that interview and he sold
that man enough belting to last him two sea-
sons there isnt any least flicker of sar-
casm in old brighams smile now when he
meets haskell

it brought results

the parting injunction that i received
from my boss when i started out on
my first trip said langdon as he dropped
the sugar into his second cup of coffee  was

 work hard and keep your nerve

  my first point was cleveland where i
landed bright and early next day i pounded
the streets that day until the lamps were lit
and succeeded in getting just one order on
my book as the result of that long days
work toward the close of the second day i
hadnt added anything to it and the next
firm on the list was one of the largest in the
city

   when i reached the reception-room there
was no one in sight and i stood around on
one foot and then the other like a chicken on
ice i dreaded that interview nearly every
traveling man was afraid of those people
finally an office door opened and a man
about six feet three walked over and took
my card after which he seemed to try to
look a hole through me

    i should like to see mr blank or his
manager if he is not in i said in a busi-
nesslike tone

     they are too busy to see you said this
near-giant turning on his heel toward the
door from which he had come

     how about his chief clerk is he busy
too  i asked as a desperate chance

  yes he jerked out in a voice that


the railroad mans magazine

would freeze you  they are all too busy
to see you we dont want anything

      sir said i in a tone that equaled his
own in severity  i dont know who you may
be or what position you may hold in this
company but i believe sir that if mr
blank realized he had a man of your caliber
in his employ lie would discharge you for i
believe him to be too good a business man
not to listen to any business proposition which
might present itself

    i looked him square in the eye as i fin-
ished and saw a faint smile hovering around
the corners of his mouth as he answered

	come in i am mr blank

  right there i sold him a bill of goods
that amounted to more than i had expected
my whole trip to net me i kept right on
selling him as long as i was in his line and
many a time blank and i laughed over the
calling-down i gave him that evening

j

this dog climbed a tree

ll- said merkel beckoning to the
waiter for another cup of cocoa  i
think i had some rougher knocks than you
on my first trip and nothing quite so soft to
bump against either i had been sent into
the mississippi valley and i made my debut
there in one of the smaller cities eleven hun-
dred miles from home a stranger among a
strange people out with a- heavy sample-
case starting out to call on my first cus-
tomer my goods were new to me id never
sold a bill before and i was conscious of
being about as green as they make em

   i called on ever jobber in the town and
was turned down with such regularity the
novelty of it had worn off by noon then
i went back to my hotel to hold a council of
war in committee of one there i was with
not a soul i knew a failure so far for a new
house and  frozen  in my first town worse
than that it was my first day

  as i sat there in my room with gloom
and dejection wrapped around me in a per-
fect fog i suddenly recalled an old story
that i remembered my mother was fond of
telling me when i was a boy it run about
as follows

 an old southern darky of antebellum
days appeared before his master in a most
wretched and dilapidated condition

  thats the matter rastus where
have you been whats happened to you
inquired his master

     oh mars henry is done had a orful

time i done took a shot at a big bear an
he jist kim right along aftah me took my
gun away an broke it up to nuffin den
i dumb a tree an de dog he done dumb a
tree an-

   why you old liar  broke in the mas-
ter  now rastus you know no dog could
climb a tree 

   well mars henry responded rastus
in all seriousness  you see dis yere dog he
done hab to climb a tree

    right then and there i concluded that in
my case it was up to the dog to climb the
tree

   after getting a bite to eat i went back
to the largest jobber i had called on in the
morning and asked him what price he was
accustomed to get from the retail trade for
such goods as i carried he told me and
then he wanted to know why i had asked
i replied that i was going out to sell some

     but they wont sell i tell you was his
snappy answer

  during that afternoon i tramped those
dusty streets sweating swearing and making
sales right and left by evening i had gath-
ered in a mighty good bunch of orders and
it was a decidedly different lad who again
presented himself to that jobber

   well said e cheerfully  ill just fill
those orders for you young man

  oh no not much i replied with an
air of independence for you see the dog had
 climbed his tree and i was safe  if you
want those orders i continued  you will
have to multiply the amount of my sales by
at least ten

    but when i closed with him next day it
was for twenty times the amount of my sales
while i have never been in the same fix or
the same place since i have never forgotten
that every dog can climb his tree when he
has to

when lewis gave the grip

rphere was a trip i made last season
a said lewis biting the top off a big
black dollar cigar on which i sold some
goods that i really hadnt expected to and
by a trick that wasnt altogether of my own
turning either

   just before starting out on the trip i
tore the palm of my right hand on a nail
that stuck out on the side of my sample-
trunk it didnt amount to more than a
scratch but it was in a very awkward place

i washed it thoroughly with an antiseptic
told in the smoker



and then thought no more about it until i
reached st louis my first stop in that
city it seemed to me that i had never before
met so many friends of the handshaking
variety when i finally landed in my room
at the hotel that scratch began to look like a
full-sized saber-cut and my whole hand
was quite inflamed and sore

    of course it was a mere trifle but you
know how sensitive a man can be over such
little things i didnt want to poke out my
left paw to every one i met and explain that
i had scratched my right hand on a pesky
nail so i kept right on handing out the sore
mitt to every customer i met wincing every
time they squeezed it

  during the course of the day i discov-
ered that by holding my hand in a certain
position i could protect the wound and at
the same time give no opportunity for com-
plaint because of a lack of warmth in my
greeting shortly after i had made this discov-
ery i chanced to meet on the street a man by
the name of bascom the buyer for one of the
biggest houses in my line he was the very
man i wanted to corral for none of our men
had ever been able to land him for a decent
order

   when i met him we shook hands and i
curled up my palm to protect the scratch and
at the same time give him a good hearty
shake as i took his hand i noticed a
peculiar look  bascoms face and he
squeezed my hand with renewed vigor to
break the pressure without giving offense i
made a sort of lever of my thumb bearing
down on the back of his hand to try to ease
his grip

  i was not a little surprised when bascom
began to talk good hard business right there
and then and finished by asking me to come
around with my samples that afternoon you
may be sure i was johnny-on-the-spot with
him and he greeted me with a great show of
cordiality within no time at all i had sold
him a bill of goods that put in the shade all
my other orders combined with his signature
snugly at the bottom of it all

   highly elated with my good days work
i was about to leave when bascom put his
hand on my shoulder and said in a low con-
fidential tone

     of course brother you know this is the
night for the general election under the by-
laws you as a traveling member are entitled
to a vote in any city you may happen to be in
at the time if you have not already made
a choice i would like to urge the fitness of
brother smith for the office of the grand ex-

alted gazook i withhold the actual name of
the office for fear it might get me into hot
water

     smith is a most worthy man bascom
continued  and we purpose giving him the
biggest vote from this city that was ever
known in the history of the order now as
i said if you have not already made your
choice of a candidate i shall consider it a
very great personal favor if you will come to
the lodge rooms to-night with your creden-
tials and take part in the election

     why bascom said i with a puzzled
expression  this is all greek to me i dont
belong to any order and know nothing about
any election still if diere is anything i can
do why-

     but he exclaimed witli some heat  you
are a member of the knights of the royal
gazooks 

     on the other hand i never even heard
of them i replied cheerfully

    then how in thunder did you come to
know the grip   he demanded with rising
temper  and you gave me the answering
grip too when i tested you by the eternal
there is a traitor somewhere  and by this
time he was almost shouting  see here he
continued in the same high key  will you
answer me this   and then he gave a pecu-
liar flourish with his left hand

    i stood there like a fool wondering if i
had suddenly gone clean dippy but with the
best manner i could assume i said bas-
com youve got me guessing i dont connect
at all

     believe me sir there has been a mis-
take he said with frost in his voice  i
trust that you are gentleman enough not to
take advantage of anydiing you may have
learned good day sir  and with that he
turned on his heel without shaking hands
flounced into his office and slammed the door
after him

   not until i got back to my hotel did i
form any connection between my scratched
hand and bascoms behavior it seems that
in twisting around to protect my sore hand
i had unconsciously stumbled upon the grip
of a secret oder however it was the means
of my selling a whopping big bill of goods
to a man i had not counted on and of get-
ting a letter of special commendation from
the house

  looking at it from his point of view
however i dont think that i will ever be
able to sell bascom any more goods

   t once sold a bill of goods said lang-
don reminiscently to an old codger down


the railroad  mans magazine

in missouri after i had given him up as a
hopeless case that was back in my salad
days and i was carrying
goods

 a line of dress-

he saw the joke

tlfhen i landed in the town and laid
  out my samples the first customer i
had on my list happened to be this old fel-
low i didnt know then that he was noted
for his dilly-dallying tactics with all drum-
mers or i would have let him go until last
and made short work of him

  he came in and began looking over my
line he handled them and rehandled them
until they were all mussed up and topsy-
turvey and still he hadnt made a noise like
an order for a single yard

   at first i did what i could to help him
get a line on what he might buy to best advan-
tage and then i gave up and sat down to
watch the performance my patience getting
closer and closer to the rough edge all the
time finally he looked over toward me and
said	

    young man do you reckon that these
here goods are fashionable 

    well i replied when i could recover
my breath  i do reckon they were when i
first begun to show them to you but ill be
hanged if i can tell you whether they are now
or not

   well sir that pert reply tickled the old
man so that he broke out into a hearty laugh
and the best of it was that he turned to and
gave me a whaling big order and he was a
steady customer of mine as long as i was in
that territorv

 judging the speed of a train

by e a spears

it is not so easy as it looks and frequently when you are going at
what seems to be a sixty-mile gait you are running
only thirty miles

tts a pretty hard matter to judge the speed at
a which your train is going unless you take out
your watch and observe the mile-posts said an
engineer

    often in case of accidents the attorneys will
try to pin you down to the rate you were running
when you ran into uncle josh at the crossing you
can never tell with accuracy and i can conceive of
conditions where you may be thirty miles an hour
off in your estimate

   you may think you are hiking along at sixty
miles an hour when in fact you are going but
thirty miles on the other hand you may be mo-
ving along at sixty miles an hour and think you
arc traveling at no more than thirty miles

    for instance the engine makes all the differ-
ence in the world take one of those big-class
fellows with wheels more than six feet in diameter
and like as not you will be sailing along at a sixty-
mile clip and not half realize it

   one reason is that there are four exhausts to
every revolution of the wheels these being large
the sounds of the exhausts occur at kss frequent
i intervals than they do on smaller wheeled engines
the more rapid the exhausts the faster jou think
you are going

   why on some of those little old engines the

exhausts are so rapid that by the sound you judge
you are eating the miles at a tremendous rate like
as not however when you get to the end of your
run a message from the superintendent will be wait-
ing for-you to ask why you are late that is what
is liable to happen if you dont keep your eye on
your watch

   engines are curiously deceiving that way some
of those rickety old machines will swing you back
and forth toss you into the air and jolt you until
you think you are knocking off the miles like min-
utes

  heres another rule that leads you astray the
more you are tossed the faster you think you are
going for that matter you can observe this while
riding in the coaches a wabbly coach lends the
sense of speed to a train a pullman is just the
opposite-it skims along and you wouldnt know
you were traveling

  you may notice too that the condition of a
road-bed makes a lot of difference on your opinion
of train speed the first thing in spring when the
frost gets out of the ground and the tracks are
heaved and warped you will wonder why you are
dragging behind the schedule when you seem to be
going so fast its the road-bed

   the more you arc shaken the swifter you think
judging the speed of a train



you are going its a good rule all right for you
have learned it from experience the trouble is
that you must consider whether you are being
shaken up in an old engine and on a rotten road-
bed or on a good road-bed and in a modern loco-
motive if you are being tossed about in a big
engine on a smooth road then your senses are not
fooling you-you are going some

   this merely goes to show that you must con-
sider the circumstances

   another condition which affects your estimate
is whether the cab is high from the ground if it
is comparatively low as some of the older locomo-
tives are you seem to go faster than you do be-
cause out of the comer of your eye the ground ap-
parently speeds by swifter it is the opposite in
higher cabs the rate of the passing ground so to
speak does not seem so rapid the farther you are
from a moving object the slower it seems to go
this enters in the mental calculation you make on
the engine although you may not know it

  the direction of the wind and its velocity is
another important feature which you dont think
about in your calculations if the wind is going
your way leaves and other objects blown through
the air parallel with you sort of make it look as if
your train wasnt much more than standing still

  as you stick your head out of the window you
dont find much of a current of air against you
it tends to make you feel that you are getting
through the element pretty slowly nevertheless

you may be swimming smoothly on at a sixty-mile
gait

  every railroad man knows that a strong head
wind cuts down the speed of a train sometimes to
a very material extent the fireman knows that a
strong wind requires a heap more coal to keep up
steam for the engineer must draw on his power
liberally that his train may hug the schedule

   yet when you arc fighting and actually creep-
ing against a strong wind you get the impression
from it that you arc driving on at a terrific rate
poke your head out of the window where the wind
jams your face and claws at your hair the dust
sweeps by at a smashing velocity trees grass and
weather-cocks all point in the opposite direction
from which you are headed thats the way things
look when you are going by them rapidly it all
makes you think you are annihilating distance-
until you look at your watch

  when a man has used a certain engine for
some length of time he gets used to its exhaust and
its swing and consequently these are less apt to
lead him astray in his estimates

   i suppose if one were to estimate the speed of
a train without a timepiece the best way would be
to stand off at a distance of about two miles then
you get a perspective you could measure a mile
with the eye and the train would not seem to be
going so fast but that you could get a fair estimate
of course this method depends entirely on ones
eyesight

dog with a railroad pass

there is a dog on the long island railroad
that nobody owns and that does not want
any one to own him at the same time he probably
has more friends than any other dog in the united
states and he is believed to be the only dog in
the world that owns a railroad pass

  his name is roxie and upon his collar is a brass
plate with an inscription which sets forth that he
is an employee of the long island railroad and
which commands all conductors to pass roxie be-
tween stations	-

  it is said that this pass was issued to roxie by
order of the president of the road because a brake-
man had tried three times to kick roxie off the
presidents private-car when the president and
his party inquired into the cause of the trouble be-
tween the dog and the brakeman they soon learned
the dogs history and not only was the dog made
welcome to a seat in the private-car at once but
the pass was issued to prevent any further inter-
ference with roxies peregrinations

  roxies occupation in life is railroad traveling
plow he came to take his first ride and whom he
belonged to before that time are both disputed
points roxie himself is silent on the subject al-
though he can express his opinion of men and
things clearly and can make his wants known

  curiously enough roxie will never make a re-
turn journey with the same train crew after he
has spent a day or so with one of his acquaint-
ances along the road perhaps a station-master or

a signal-tower operator or a switchman or the post-
master or the hotel-keeper he will take a notion to
go down to the station and meet a certain train

  as soon as his train comes along roxie jumps on
board and appropriates any vacant seat he can
find if he cannot find a vacant seat he will curl
himself up on the floor and doze quietly until he
arrives at his destination the moment his sta-
tion is called he will jump up and get to the front
platform ready to make off

  after a visit of what he considers the proper
length he quietly boards another train and pro-
ceeds to some other station it is considered lucky
to have a visit from roxie	

  sometimes he goes back in the direction from
which he came sometimes he goes further along
the road he has been at every stop on the road
from montauk point to flatbush avenue hundreds
of times during the last ten years but he has never
been known to go the entire length of the road in
one journey

  as a passenger roxies tastes are very demo-
cratic he does not seem to care much whether
he rides in the cab with the engineer in the bag-
gage-car in the smoker or in the day coaches but
he seems to have some doubt about the validity of
his pass for the parlor-cars and seldom ventures
into them although he will enter the presidents
private-car with the utmost assurance that he will
be welcome wherever an officer of the road is to be
found-new york sun
peter the great

by s o conley

        he thought his time to reform had
        gome but he met a bitter opposition

eter mcnulty known to the
police and cherry hill as peter
the great was not good to look
upon - sprawling on a seat in
central park blinking with
bleary eyes at nothing in particu-
lar and hiccuping beerily at intervals under
normal conditions peters claims to beauty
were of a nebulous sort life that begins with
frequent famines punctuated by constant fist-
fighting and develops along the lines of the
gutter is not conducive to the development of
attractive features

  pete was squat and broad with heavy jaws
and huge hands his eyes were small and
penetrating his ears were fleshy flaps with
serrated edges-the result of east side com-
bats

  the sons of mulligans rest had been giv-
ing their annual ball and chowder at
schweitzermanns wood pete was not only
a son but had been appointed an assistant
sergeant-at-arms of the affair the position
gave him innumerable chances to get square
with his enemies consequently the night
and much of the morning had been given over
to a glorious series of fights

  finally when mr schweitzermann with
the aid of the reserves from a near-by police
station succeeded in regaining possession of
his wood pete for reasons which he could
not explain steered unsteadily toward central
park the taw-y silk-and-tinsel badge which
proclaimed him a son still glittering on his
breast

  there on the bench he sat drowsing and
dreaming of the joys of the preceding hours
and his face battered by many fists and bloat-
ed by many libations was not a pleasant sight

  yet freddie pursuing an errant ball was
by no means frightened when on turning the
sudden curve of the path he came upon peter
the ball was rolling under the bench close by

petes feet freddie paused but an instant
then dived secured his treasure and took a
critical survey of the huddled frowsy man in
front of him

  the badge caught his childish eye and he
came to the conclusion that the assistant ser-
geant-at-arms was worth cultivating so he
said  hallo and put out his small hand in
confidential fashion

  pete slowly opened his bleary eyes

   hallo kid he replied taking the childs
hand in his own big grimy paw

  the man with his brutalized face the boy
with his unsullied innocence of feature eyed
each other in silence for a short time peter
under the influence of a sort of dull shame
tried to sit up straighter and removed mbhat
from over his eyebrows freddie made a
closer survey of his new acquaintance

   wots yer name kid   asked peter with
an effort

   frederick wade hilton and ise five
years old was the reply  whats yours 

  peter de gr- i mean pete mcnulty
wot yer doin here all by yer lonesome  

   not alone nurse is just round the cor-
ner wiv sister beatrice sister beatrices only
a baby she cant walk she has to be
pushed in a baby-tarridge did you ever ride
in a tarridge 

   you bet why i drives one peter
quieted his fragment of a conscience by re-
minding it that once or twice a year he really
did hold a brief job as truck-driver

 wiv real horses asked freddie anx-
iouslv

   sure mike-

  my name isnt mike-its freddie

   dat goes- began pete

  what goes queried the child looking
round in order to see what object in motion
pete was apparently indicating

  pete was perplexed his muddled brain
peter the great



was incapable of reshaping the phrase he
made no answer freddie awaiting the ex-
planation again indulged in a scrutiny of
peter and then it was that his eyes rested
admiringly on the badge

pete caught the look and divined its mean-
ing his unsteady fingers began to fumble
at the safety-pin finally he managed to dis-
engage the affair and handed it to the child
 here kid heres sumpin fer yez

  are you sure you dont want it he
asked politely

  sure-its all fer youse

  the boy took the badge with his left hand
and once more extended his right pete with
a hoarse chuckle of amusement shook the
small palm heartily

 thank you said freddie examining his
prize with shining eyes then to the utter
amazement and consternation of the man
freddie lifting up a trustful face went on
id like to give you a kiss for this

  the pure lips of the little one touched the
sin-seared cheek of the rum-soused thug

  just then freddies nurse appeared on the
scene and forcibly hustled him off

   how dare you kiss that dirty bum  was
what pete heard as nurse and child started up
the path

  pete did not doze again with wide-open
red-rimmed eyes he looked speculatively at
the squirrels once he began well ill
be- but checked himself and finished the
sentence with his usual ejaculation of sur-
prise  if it dont beat tiiree goats 

  then he softly and surreptitiously rubbed
his cheek where freddies kiss had rested
soon he fell to gazing at the squirrels again
at length hungry and thirsty and bewil-
dered at certain feelings in the region of his
heart to which he was a stranger he betook
himself to the rear room of a near-by saloon
where between gulps of lager and spoonfuls
of free soup he tried to wonder what had
come over him

  that which rang most forcibly in his ears
was the remark of freddies nurse why did
you kiss that dirty bum  

  for the next few days pete was to be found
in his old- haunts on the  hill  and at the
 point consorting with his cronies and
swallowing the accustomed vileness callcd by
the courtesy title of whisky at rare intervals
lie would momentarily withdraw into himself
only to emerge muttering if it dont lay out
three goats  one day he induced  string 
murphy wrho could read and write to ac-
company him to a bowery drug-store where
with the assistance of a city directory they

ascertained that one frederick w hilton
broker lived on madison avenue not far
from eighty-fifth street

   de kids fadder i lays me uppers mut-
tered pete to himself

  string pricked up his ears  am i on in
de graft he asked -

   aw wots eatin yez   inquired pete

 deres nuttin doin

  whos de kid den inquired murphy
sarcastically a life membership in an east
side gang somehow stimulates ones power of
inductive reasoning

  petes eyes blazed if ever you slips me
dat agen he replied slowly  ill make youse
tink you was-

  he drew himself up with a jerk so with
a scowl and a significant glance at strings
jaw-point he turned on his heel and departed
that night string bruited it abroad that pete
was either going to  turn a big trick  or was
out of his mind

  meeting freddie in the park had curiously
impressed the cherry hill man the child
had brought into being emotions to which he
had been a stranger and which were all the
more bewildering because they seemed to run
counter to the habits and thoughts of his life

  somehow they seemed to make him un-
comfortable when he drank or cursed in
his dumb darkened way he felt the conta-
gion that existed between them and the purity
of the lad who had kissed his rough cheek

  half angry with himself he cut short a
string of blasphemy and refrained from
 touching  a half-drunken sailor-notwith-
standing his needs and those of the gang

  four days after his meeting with the child 
peter didnt show up until noon then in
answer to several invitations to  beer his
face he explained that his insides had gone
back on him andre was off de booze

  later he strolled around to lee fongs
laundry on madison street lee had deco-
rated his window with some ily-specked
prayer-papers a sample collar some cuffs a
shirt an anemic lily that apparently derived
its sustenance from superimposed pebbles
some cheap oriental vases and a couple of
goggled-eyed chinese dolls

  pete fixed a thoughtful eye on the dolls
and after some hesitation entered the store

  now lee having had much experience
with the gangs of his neighborhood and
knowing that they visited him less for laundry
than for loot came forward cautiously hold-
ing a flat-iron in his hand

  how muchee john asked pete indi-
cating the dolls


the railroad mans magazine

  lee understood or thought he did it was
evident to him that his visitor intended a ruse
while the dolls were being taken from the
window there would be a descent on the cash-
drawer and the incidental lifting of stray
linen

  therefore lee replied no sellee
yez wont returned the disappointed
pete bet yez tree goats yez will

  no want sellee returned lee keeping a
wary eye on pete and waving the flat-iron
gently but ominously

   pete took a peep over the red chintz curtain
at the rear of the window made an appraise-
ment of the dolls dived into his pocket pulled
out a mixed handful of cigarette - papers
matches tobacco and small change and
picking out fifteen cents placed it on the
counter then his hand flashed over the
curtain and drew up a doll

  s-long said mcnulty as he opened the
door to exit an de nex time a gent asks
yez de price uv yer chink kids yez had best
be civil-see tank yer josh yer yellow
split-eyed wash-tub dat i aint sent de gang
down to clean yer place out

   with the doll carefully snuggled in his ca-
pacious inside pocket pete walked toward
third avenue where he squandered five cents
on a shave and ten cents on a hair-cut then
he boarded a north-bound car

  pete on reaching central park wandered
towara the point where he had first met fred-
die but freddie was not visible and pete
began little tours over the lawns and in the
neighborhood of the menagerie

  after two or three hours had been spent
fruitlessly in this work he sought and found
a shady seat confessing to himself his disap-
pointment and wondering if after all the
boys acquaintance was worth the price of
abstinence from his usual quota of booze and
cigarettes to say nothing of shaking the gang
and the incidental disadvantages to himself

  meditating on these things pete began to
doze and finally dropped off into dream-
land from that region he was brought back
to earth by a shrill and familiar  hallo 
opening his eyes he saw freddie in front
of him and freddies face plainly showed
that he felt genuine pleasure in again meet-
ing his friend of the badge

  morning freddie said pete

  good morning replied freddie with an
accent on the first word 

  hows de baby sister went on pete
after an awkward pause

    shes all right replied the boy  have
you any little sisters

   naw said pete

  any brothers pursued freddie

  naw

   freddie looked puzzled and a trifle sorry
but continued  where does your father and
mother live  

   aint got none

   the boy gazed thoughtfully at the man in
front of him and asked  who puts you to
bed and hears you say your prayers 

   peter the great shifted uneasily in his seat
 i puts myself to bed he asserted  you
see ise bigger and older than youse

  do you say your prayers all by your-
self went on his small inquisitor

   peter did not reply instead he reached
into his pocket and produced the doll

   freddie took it with a grave  thank you
and after examining it closely he said  you
wont mind if i give this to beatrice will you
i am a boy and i dont play with dolls

  dats dead right assented pete i
never tought of dat

  but added freddie earnestly i am
much obliged to you

   at this moment there was an interruption
a french maid wheeling the perambulator
in which was baby beatrice appeared on the
scene

  she looked suspiciously at pete caught
hold of freddies hand and led him away
threatening to tell his mother about his  talk-
ing to these brutal men  she also insisted
that freddie should throw away the doll but
on this point the little chap was obdurate
sticking to the toy manfully while pete
grinned approvingly at his action

   from that time on for two or three weeks
pete pretty nearly every fine day was to be
found in the park trying to speak to his small
friend occasionally he brought with him
some bizarre gift such as a carved coconut-
shell which he had managed to persuade a
sailor friend to yield a dried star-fish ba-
nanas and in one instance a highly colored
lithograph of the jeffries-johnson fight

   freddies parents acting on the reports of
the french maid naturally objected to the
acquaintance that existed between the child
and his queer friend they harbored thoughts
of kidnapers and other equally unpleasant in-
dividuals

   so it came about one day that peter clean
and sporting an immaculate collar and a
breath devoid of the odor of tobacco and whis-
ky was warned by a park policeman that the
park squad was onto hirrf and that he had
a good mind to take him to the arsenal on gen-
eral principles
peter the great



   this followed hard on a statement made to
him by freddie while the latters lips quiv-
ered regretfully that he had been forbidden
to speak to or to even look at his cherry hill
friend

  peter turned away from the park that
night in the society of the gang in an un-
availing attempt to forget the boy and his
affection for him he imbibed more than his
quota of whisky only to awake the following
morning feeling disgusted with himself and
his surroundings

   he was not accustomed to take his rules of
life from the police and in spite of the warn-
ing that he had received he still continued to
haunt those portions of the park where he
knew his little favorite was usually to be
found

   sometimes he caught sight of the child
and felt himself rewarded for his trip up-
town on his endeavor to speak to fred-
die however the boy with tears starting to
his eyes would always answer i cant
talk mother says i am not to

   with a little sob he would pass on leav-
ing pete to wander gloomily down-town feel-
ing a distaste for the  hill  by contrast with
his late happiness up-town

  one day pete in spite of himself had
again journeyed to the park and late in the
afternoon was leaving it t the sixty-sixth
street entrance sullen weary and disappoint-
ed as he ascended the steps he saw to his
delight in front of him freddie and beatrice
accompanied by their white-capped guardian

   not daring to show himself and yet eager
to look once more upon the face of the boy
he followed them cautiously up the avenue
to seventieth street

   there the nurse and her charge started to
cross the street the avenue was crowded
with moving vehicles between them the
nurse thought she saw an opening but an au-
tomobile suddenly bore down upon her and
simultaneously from the other direction more
carriages began to shut her in

   the automobile did its best to slack up
but-a tire snapped the report started two
spirited horses just behind instantly the ani-
mals began to rear and tug furiously

  with a shriek the panic-stricken woman
abandoned the children and sought safety in
flight

   peter had seen it all he dashed in under
the heads of the crowding horses and in one
instant over the driversseat he reached
the children just as one of the frightened team
struck the baby-carriage

  the next moment he had swung freddie
onto his shoulder and rescued baby beatrice
from the entangling folds of her lap-robe
handing her to a scared coachman behind
him then ir some miraculous fashion he
managed to make his way to the sidewalk
being grazed on the forehead by a glancing
shaft

   freddie was in a state of childish panic
indeed pete had a good deal of difficulty in
holding the terror-frenzied child in his arms
until the sidewalk was reached

   there the little fellows fear-befogged brain
somehow or other identified pete with the in-
cidents of the moments before and he shrieked
to his rescuer to put him down

  dats all right freddie began pete
soothingly

    let me go let me go-you dirty bum 
shouted the child and he struck at petes
face with his tiny fist

   the cherry hill tough put the child on his
feet without another word freddie was at
once taken possession of by the nurse

   pete turned on his heel his cheeks an un-
pleasant yellow

   i wouldnt have tought it of the kid he
muttered with a curse  his going back on
me like dat

    i saw you rescue those children said a
well-dressed man  it was a courageous act
will you take this he held out a bill

  pete laughed bitterly nix he said
and walked away

  that night peter the great was his old
tough self again to fitly celebrate his re-
turn to his old life he  did up  a cop  good
and plenty

   about a year later when he fell into the
clutches of the law owing to a difficulty with
the leader of a rival gang during which the
latter had three conical pieces of lead distrib-
uted through his person the judge in send-
ing pete up the river for a term of years
took occasion to say that men of his type
seemed to be outside of all influence for good
and that their reformation seemed to be im-
possible

my new acquaintance

 he strangers cottage was a small
  affair it consisted of just two
  rocms and they were as devoid
  of any of the comforts of home
  as any place i had ever seen

  one dilapidated chair a tablq
that had lost two of its legs in a scrimmage
of some sort and was propped against the
wall for support a shelf on which rested the
occupants toilet appliances and the inevita-
ble sleeping-mat on the floor-that was all

  the cottage was thatched with coconut-
leaves the walls were of rude undressed
planks-but the view from the window was
a fascination

  the stranger as i have said was a squat
middle-aged man his hair was long and
white and his face was covered with an un-
kempt beard

  his tiny black eyes were popping nervous-
ly in their sockets as if he were fearing some
dire calamity at any moment he seemed to
be the allegory of fright there was some-
thing on his mind that was troubling him

  he offered me the lone chair and sat him-
self on the floor with the easy manner of the
natives who as i have said in previous chap-
ters adopt the  tail or-fash ion  attitude with
peculiar ease and grace

  akipo entered soon after and took his seat
carelessly in the middle of the floor i won-
dered why the stranger made no objection to
the natives presence if he had something se-
cret to tell me and i was not a little surprised
that he did not order akipo out

  i learned afterward that the native idea of
personal privilege is vastly different from
our own the fact of the matter is this

began in the july railroad manll

all things being equal to him he feels that
his presence is ever welcome no matter where
he may be and he takes everything in such
a gentle philosophical manner that there is
little or no objection when he comes around
at any rate akipo could not understand
english beyond the veriest  yes  and  no
and the stranger knew that

  when akipo had seated himself the stran-
ger turned to me and told his story it was a
rambling matter at first for his tears flowed
faster than his words and he frequently
choked with such terrific emotion that he
could not speak

  my name is john pennzer said he
 what i am going to tell you is the gospel
truth oh my friend i have been waiting
so long to tell it to some one i have cried
it out to the stars but they could not hear
i have hurled it to the sun and the great
ocean but they go on and on as if they did
not care 

  he wrung his hands in anguish it was
evident that my stranger who-to give him
every benefit of the doubt-was really john
pennzer was a poet too

  i am glad that i can understand you
i said let me know how i can help you

  you can help me by listening he con-
tinued  this awful secret has been a weight
on my breast for years let me tell it to
you some human beingmust know it some
one who can understand

    go on i said

  john pennzer looked at akipo for a mo-
ment and akipo was in the position of a
mute at a greek tragedy-he could only un-
derstand by the gestures that something un-
usualwas going on

  pennzer was satisfied with akipo evident-
ly then he looked me straight and steadfast
in the eye for fully a moment and-said

magazine single coplcs  cents


the man who wasnt game



   i am a bank-robber

  fearing that this admission would deprive
me of either breath or reason or both he
stopped for a moment to await the effect

  but i was prepared for that and even
more my intuition told me that john penn-
zer was either a bank-robber a murderer or
some other sort of escaped criminal i im-
agine now that his surprise was even greater
than mine when i looked at him in bland
calmness and simply replied

  yes

   i am a bank-robber he repeated  i
have been on this island an escaped criminal
for over ten years i dare not write to my
family for fear that the police will intercept
the letter and come for me for years every
time that a boat of any sort approached the
shore i scanned every face aboard fearing
that a detective had come for me and when
you drove up just now i thought that my time
had come

   oh i would not care much it has been
like prison here all these years the strain
on the mind has been worse than purgatory

   if i had only given myself up and gone
to jail-if t had only given myself up and
gone to jail - the judge might have had
mercy on me and i would have been a free
man now-a free man instead of a prisoner
here

  i knew all this was coming and i sup-
pose that i looked at him somewhat disin-
terestedly however he gave me a sudden
startled piercing look and said

  are you sure youre not a detective

    most certainly not i answered  i am
as i have told you a wanderer-a wanderer
on the face of the earth i just dropped
onto this beautiful island as a meteor drops
from the skv and i like it so very much that
i think i will stay here always

  you will like it and will live happily
for you have your conscience he went on
no man can live happily without his con-
science- clear and clean he may have
riches and luxury and all else that the world
can give but conscience is his best compan-
ion

  this paradise with all its natural won- -
ers-even with that view which you can see
through the door- has been to me nothing
more than a prison

  he stopped short in his preachment and
said

  oh i promised you some refreshment
then turning to akipo he rattled in the
latters tongue an order for coconuts

  akipo was on his feet in a moment ta-

king a stout piece of rolled twine from the
folds of his parcu he deftly knotted it to
each big toe i was more interested in his
immediate undertaking than i was in ienn-
zers confession and unto the native i fast-
ened my attention

  the twine which akipo had fastened to
his big toes was about fourteen inches in
length just sufficient to give him leeway to
hobble into the yard he maneuvered to a
tall cononut-trce some hundred yards away
and using the string as a means of locomo-
tion he scrambled to the top and soon we
heard the welcome thud of young green coco-
nuts as they struck the ground

  the coconut-tree i may add to this tale
as a means of information is very tall and
of the palm variety all of its foliage grows
at the very top the leaves are long and
tough and the fruit grows in mighty clus-
ters in their cooling shade

  a coconut in its green stage-and in its
green ijtage its milk is one of the most satis-
fying wholesome beverages known- is about
as large as a mans head every part of the
tree is useful

  as one famous south sea writer has truth-
fully said to the native it is meat drink
fuel fire and wearing apparel

  when the natives climb the trees for the
fruit they look something like a monstrous
cat leaping up a pole the hands work in
the same manner as a felines paws and the
legs are drawn up in unison-the string at-
tached to the toes catching in the bark and
acting as a support

  akipo soon returned with coconuts opened
them and placed them within easy reach
john pennzer picked one up and raising it
to his lips to drink proffered my very good
health out of courtesy i did likewise
we quaffed the wonderfully cooling milk
and then he proceeded 

  do you remember the robbery of the old
eighth ward bank in new york-some ten
years ago  

  he peered at me inquisitively and then
continued 

  no you are too young

  i have never been in new york i ven-
tured

  even so said john pennzer had you
been old enough you would have heard of it
of all the bank-robberies of the past quarter
of a century that was the most sensational
why there were columns written about it my
boy columns mind you

  he stretched his arms in seeming pride
and the basso tremolo of his voice indicated


the-railroad mans magazine

that it was something to have been the central
figure of a bank-robbery

    but i escaped they never found me
they are wondering to this day where i am
you are the first white man-indeed my
friend you are the only man in all this
world to whom i have spoken about this
affair you have never heard the story

  i shook my head

chapter xiii
the pennzer proposition

tsten then and i will tell you

i robbed the old eighth ward bank
on the ight of jime  just ten years ago
come next month oh i have kept most
careful count and i know

  there was a bundle containing just one
hundred thousand dollars in ten twenty fifty
and thousand - dollar notes in the vault it
was a sort of reserve fund and it rested in a
steel drawer untouched for years i was the
security clerk and frequently i was obliged
to go to the vault to examine some security or
to make an inventory of those on hand

   one day i saw this bundle of notes-a
fortune i saw it again and again always
the same smiling welcome friend of die vault
i seemed o grow to like it-and i use the
word in its emotional sense he said with a
long-arm gesture as if priding himself on
his rhetorical finesse

  yes i began to feel a certain liking for
that bundle of bills he continued  at
first when i would open carelessly the steel
drawer it seemed to smile at me and i dis-
tinctly remember saying one day  hallo
there you are again 

    then i began to discover that i could not
go into the vault without a look at the bundle
and i soon found myself opening the drawer
and actually speaking to it whether i had
to go to that particular drawer or not

   the bundle seemed so lonesome and
when i would shut it up in that dark abode
it seemed to just want to come out

  one morning it must have been three
months or more after the day that i first saw
that attractive bundle i was obliged to
change its position in the drawer to make
room for some very valuable securities up
to that time i had never touched it

  to me it was like a living thing and i
remember that i placed my hand on it as if
it were a little child whose position in its
cradle was uncomfortable but the moment
my hand touched it

  then it was a different thing to me
then it became more than a mere bundle of
printed paper calling for so much metal
it became a-a beautiful woman begging
pleading demanding that i take her from her
prison

    i placed the notes most carefully in their
new corner which was nearer the outer edge
of the drawer and as i closed it i took one
lingering look and i knowthat they beckoned
to me

   that night i layr afrake for hours those
notes were within my grasp they called for
one hundred thousand dollars in the coin of
the united states they could bring me all
the happiness that a man could ask they
were within my grasp

   i only had to take them i only had to
take them

  i actually found myself lost in the con-
templation of a theft

   here i was actually planning the theft
of one hundred thousand dollars with as
much unconcern as if i were planning a
journey to coney island

  i hastily pulled myself together great
god what had come over me i tried
then and there to upbraid myself for letting
myself think such a thought i john penn-
zer who was the soul of honor and unto
whom had been entrusted the wealth of trust-
ing employers-i who was looked upon as
a model for young men-the father of a
family-the pillar of a church-letting my-
self think such thoughts

   i remember that i upbraided myself and
then went to sleep the next day while
walking to the bank my heart sank within
me because i had been such a weak fool i
resolved to never again let my mind rest on a
dishonest idea and if that bundle of notes
had the power to make such a fool of me
then i would put it where i would not be
obliged to see it and dismiss it from my
mind

   but when i opened the drawer that
morning a more welcome smile than usual
greeted me

  i shut the drawer with a slam but i
thought i was cruel i opened it again
curse me for a jackass but i really seemed
to feel that that bundle of bills needed fresh
air and chance to look round

  pennzer actually laughed at the peculiar
ridiculosity of his statement

   so i left the drawer open while i was
examining some securities and now and
then i would let my eyes turn in the direc-
tion of the bundle
n

the man who wasnt game



   finally the time came to go i turned
to the drawer to close it something stayed
my hand it was impossible to do other than
to pick up that precious bundle

    i did so i spoke to it i caressed it i
toyed with it god help me at length i
opened it

   i laid die bills one by one on the little
shelf above the drawer and my eyes feasted
in jealousy that they should belong to some
one else and not to me then lest some one
enter the vault and become suspicious of my
innocent escapade i made up the bundle
just as i had found it and put it back in its
proper place in the steel drawer

  what i say may be either grewsome or
insane to you my friend but that bundle
again assumed the-oh i do not know what
to call it but to me it was a living breath-
ing thing

   it seemed broken-hearted-there there
dont laugh it actually seemed broken-
hearted and it began crying to me-yes cry-
ing aloud

take me take me  it seemed to say

 dont leave me here to suffer alone you
need me take me take me

    i petted it tenderly i went on with my
work and went home that night only to suf-
fer worse than i had suffered the night
previous

    i managed to get myself out of the spell
of hypnotic influence of the thing and to
look at my position calmly i reasoned that
there was the enormous sum of one hun-
dred thousand dollars within my grasp that
sum was a princely fortune with it i could
flee to some foreign country hide myself for
a while and then my future would be secure
for with such a sum a man of my tastes
would be satisfied

   then i tried to throwit off go to sleep
and return to my natural state of mind i
resolved that i would ask the cashier of the
bank to remove that bundle in the morning

i could tell him that it was in my way or
invent some other flimsy excuse and he
would gladly do it

   but all this good resolving vanished like
the mists on yonder sea the spell of the
coin the call of the cash the lure of the
lucre or whatever your mind chooses to call
it had me in its grip

    in a little while it was all over i had
resolved to steal that money that was all
there was to it

    something impelling was working against
my better self i had lost all reason for
anything else there was only one thing to

do now that was to plan the robbery so that
no one would intercept me-and make good
my escape

    the mostvfeasible plan-after i thought
of a dozen and discarded them all as worth-
less-was to lock myself in the vault or to
be more exact remain hidden in the vault
until the automatic machinery operated by
the giant timepiece in the bank closed it for
the night

    i would have a candle and matches the
getting of the money proper meant nothing
i had only to open the drawer and ex-
tract it

   then with a small screwdriver i would
unfasten the lock from the inside just as i
had seen a mechanic do one day when fix-
ing it i knew the principle that operated
the door and i was certain that i would
succeed

    once outside the vault it would be an
easy matter for me to make the street the
only opposition that i might encounter was
the night watchman but as he kept his vigil
near the front door and as i intended to
make my exit by the rear i anticipated no
trouble from him

  that day i worked in my customary
mechanical style as if there was nothing out
of the ordinary on my mind we clerks get
into a rut and there we stay just so long
as we do the work and our honesty and
trustworthiness are never questioned noth-
ing is said to us

   about twelve minutes to three oclock i
took a farewell look at all my bank com-
panions some of us had worked together
for over ten years then i gathered up all
my papers slipped them into my desk and
taking what securities i had before me i
started for the vault

    one of the bookkeepers was just ahead
of me he was putting away some private
papers belonging to the president of the con-
cern he chatted pleasantly for we prac-
tically entered the vault together

    i breathed a sigh of relief when he ha-
stened out saying that lie was leaving early
to catch a train the moment he left i peered
out and into the bank it lacked three min-
utes of three oclock at first i realized that
not a person knew that i was in the vault
but the moment that i hidmyself in the rear
behind a patent cabinet used for storing rail-
road securities it seemed that a million eyes
were on me

   those three moments went like so many
years i crouched down for some belated
clerk might possibly rush in at the last mo-


the railroad mans magazine

ment to leave something for safety-and if
i were seen-great shivers

   i began to tremble and a cold perspira-
tion poured from my face i looked at my
watch it was just three-the minute hand
was just touching the tiny mark of the hour

   i peered around the corner of my hiding
place

   suddenly there was a muffled click
quicker than it takes to tell the huge steel
door of the vault swung to and with the ease
and wonder that marks the method of im-
proved machinery it closed

  it closed and the daylight vanished i
crouched lower in the darkness waited with
bated breath for a moment and then came
another muffled click

  the vault was locked no human hand
no key no power save destruction could open
that door now-not until ten oclock the next
morning when the giant clock that had closed
it would point to the hour of ten

    that at least was the principle on which
it worked and on which its makers built it
but i was in its vitals now-and my skill
had to prevail

  the darkness was cloying i struck a
match as it flared up i looked about my
prison to see if there wasnt a chair no-
body had thought to put such a commodity
there how careless are inventors regarding
bank robbers

   just as the match went out i looked
at my watch only four minutes past three
the clerks were still working they would
not leave until five oclock then the char-
women would come in and clean the place
for the morrow it would take them an hour
or so and then the watchman would go his
rounds and take his comfortable chair to his
place near the front door the weather was
warm and the board of directors let him keep
a window open

   i figured that i would want to make my
escape t night the best hour would be about
midnight but when i thought of waiting in
that awful blackness for nearly nine hours
i felt that my reason would leave me

   i was standing up and my legs began to
cramp i walked to and fro but i encoun-
tered all mariner of obstacles it was im-
possible to move with any degree of comfort
then i tried standing still again i re-
mained perfectly restful for some fifteen
minutes and in sheer desperation i sat on
the floor

    i soon regretted the absence of drinking
water and again i spoke most unkindly of
the neglect of safety-vault manufacturers re-

garding thieving bank clerks indeed they
might have given me a chance to go outside
and walk around until i was ready to steal
their money

   i sat there staring into the darkness
which soon began to-blur my eyes in such a
manner that it soon seemed to me that i
could even see every corner of the vault i
even put my hand on the steel drawer which
contained my hundred thousand dollars and
i could see the bills all piled up in order
awaiting the possession of him whom they
had tempted to crime

   but that terrible darkness became too
awful for words i shut my eyes to keep it
out-that is the only way in which i can ex-
press myself with my eyes closed my
mind seemed more at ease i stretched out
on the floor i began to dream of the mor-
row when i would be the possessor of one
hundred thousand dollars-think my boy
one hundred thousand dollars

   i planned and planned i went into a
reverie of rarest delight it was important
that i should do so too for my mind had
to be distracted and my eyes kept from
dwelling on that terrible darkness

  at length i could feel myself falling
asleep oh it was welcome better asleep
dreaming of the glorious future in store for
me than awake in that narrow confine with
no sound save my watch ticking ticking the
moments that never seemed to run into
hours

chapter xiv
the hundred thousand

suddenly i remember i awoke with a
 start the mind quickly knows its
surroundings even though the sleeping body
may be in strange cjuarters

   i sat up quickly struck a match and
looked at my watch it was ten minutes to
eleven why wait until midnight i thought
why not begin now it was night the
breaking of the lock might take some time
this was the appointed hour

   i rose to my feet lit the candle and
placed it on the shelf above the drawer then
i opened he drawer and took therefrom the
bundle of bills i quickly deposited these in
the big valise that i had brought for the pur-
pose and the heft was not more than i could
master when i had made my freedom

  then i turned lo the door of the vault
with my scrcnv-driver i began to unfasten
the plate that covered the mechanism it
the man who wasnt game



was unusually difficult i thought the
number of screws seemed endless finally
i had them all out and the plate fell to the
floor with more noise than i had anticipated

   gingerly i began to prod the various
springs and wires that held the lock fast i
was working blindly but more successfully
than i knew

   i touched some vital part there was a
sickening sort of a thud a short succession
of clicks and the door swung open with a
bang

  i had just time to extinguish the candle
and dart behind the cabinet i listened with
my heart going against my breast like a trip-
hammer bang bang bang it went with
the regularity of a pendulum

   i feared the worst the watchman had
only to touch a button and the entire build-
ing would be thrown into a flood of light
but-he was asleep i plainly heard him
snoring

  there was a dim light burning in the
outer offices near the door this was suffi-
cient to guide me

   i made my way to the rear of the build-
ing where i was well acquainted with a
small door used only for the transfer of spe-
cie it opened on a small alley that con
nected with the main street this door
opened only from the inside it was held
locked by a series of bolts similar to those
used on a safe and was operated by a com-
bination which was known only to three
members of the bank including myself

  the combination was  left  right
 leftmy nervous fingers could hardly
turn the knob they seemed powerless to
vfork properly

   i struck a match i scarcely cared if i
aroused the watchman for i might as well
be caught one way as another in the dim
light i saw the knob turn from left to right
to the different numbers i could hear the
gentle roll of the ball-bearings and then the
welcome clicking sound that told me that the
lock was in my power

   i pulled the handle and the door opened

i picked up the bag containing my treasure
and darted down the alley to the street

  my next problem was where to go an
old detective has told me since-not knowing
of course who i was-that the cleverest
thieves will plan a robbery to the minutest
detail and then having come into possession
of the plunder will fall into the clutches of
the law by not knowing what to do with it

   i was in this very quandary the streets
were deserted and dark everything was

propitious for a deed of the kind i had just
committed i had the spoils in my hand

   but where could i go

  nowhere in the morning the theft
would be discovered the escape by the rear
door would fasten the crime on the three men
who knew its combination and i would be
the only one who could not prove an alibi
i was the only one of the three who knew
that the notes were kept in the drawer

  well my friend i would have given
twice the sum to have been able to return
those notes i would have given years of
my life to have been able to go back just
twenty-four hours but it was too late

   i went to the railroad station and took
an early train for chicago that afternoon
the newspapers contained full accounts of the
great bank robbery in new york and my dis-
appearance

   descriptions of me were being telegraphed
to every city in the world i hid in the back
room of a saloon and now and then emerged
to get the extras as they came out all
night i walked the streets with my hundred
thousand dollars and every time i saw a po-
liceman i dodged down a side thoroughfare

   the morning papers proved that i was the
most talked of man in the country every-
thing connected with the robbery had been
sent broadcast and a reward of five thou-
sand dollars was offered for my capture i
did resent however the statement made to
the press by the sleeping watchman he told
in the most graphic atmosphere of the fic-
tion-writer how i had overpowered him
gagged him and bound him to a chair from
which he had freed himself oniy after the
most difficult struggle

   i saw that i had only one thing to do
and that was to leave the country i made
my way by a circuitous route into canada
and then down into mexico and finally to
a chilian port

   there i found a schooner bound for this
island i was a traveling naturalist and the
bag containing my hundred thousand dollars
was filled with valuable and perishable speci-
mens which was my reason for keeping it
locked and handling it so carefully

  oh the world is full of fools we are
all gullible it doesnt take much to make
us believe that the motto of wise puck de-
serves a prominent place on our escutcheons

   i landed here the years have passed
and i am still unmolested you are the first
man whom i have taken into my confidence
i cant stand this isolation much longer so
i am going to make you a proposition


the railroad mans magazine

  he stopped talking for a moment then
turned to akipo to whom he spoke he
evidently asked the native to leave the room
under some promise or other for akipo
smiled and went out to the small porch
where he dropped on his haunches took a
long piece of coconut liber and some native
tobacco from his pareu and began rolling
himself a cigarette

  pennzer arose and closed the door being
careful to bolt it

  is it necessary to do that i asked

   yes he replied   want to be alone
with you i want to show you

  he looked furtively around him and then
disappeared into the other room i heard a
key turn in a lock and presently he returned
with a good-sized traveling-bag this he
placed at my feet he opened it and brought
forth bundle after bundle of united states
bank-bills

    this is what i have left of the loot he
continued  i really do not know how much
it amounts to now i should say that i have
not spent more than two or three thousand
dollars at any rate if you will agree tv re-
turn to the united states and offer the bank
from which i stole this money seventy thou-
sand dollars in cash i will give you ten thou-
sand dollars for your trouble

   the proposition must be closed in this
way i am to return through you seventy
thousand dollars of the stolen money pro-
vided the bank will give a written agreement
that i am to have my freedom

  i thought it over as he packed up the
notes and returned to the adjoining room with
the bag there was more money than i had
ever seen before i might make my demand
for my share of it in advance then if i
cared to vamose with it he would be none
the wisef

  with ten thousand dollars i could-i
found myself in the same lure that had
trapped this unfortunate man and wrecked
his whole life great grief but it is a mes-
meric power

   in the short time that elapsed while he was
transferring that bag of stolen money to its
place in the outer room such thoughts flashed
through my mind that i would blush to record
here

  i even thought of murdering him and ma-
king away with the entire sum what is this
awful money lust why is it the most poig-
nant and damnable of all powers i now
understood why he could not resist the temp-
tress

  when he had finished his story i de-

spised him now i sympathized with him
from the bottom of my heart

  he returned to the room and said

   you need not give me your answer now
there is plenty of time i can wait a little
while longer go home and think it over
but i will ask one thing

  he was looking at me with steady eyes
  what is that i asked

  he reached for my hand just why i
gave him no resistance i do not know at
any rate he clasped it warmly and looking
me straight in the eyes said

    i have told you a great secret i trust in
you-man to man if you should deny me
the acceptance of my offer promise me that
you will never never breathe a word of it to a
living soul

  i promised him

       chapter xv
       the lure that won

f left him and aroused akipo who was
now enjoying one of those siestas into
which the south sea islander falls so easily
he was stretched out fast asleep even the
antiquated horse of our conveyance was so
sound asleep that his nostrils almost touched
the ground

  i ordered akipo to drive home meaning
of course to the place where tati lived he
lashed the poor beast unmercifully to wake
him from his slumbers and off we started
through the idle town to the rose-embowered
palace of the woman whom i loved

  everywhere the idle breeze wafted the fra-
grance of the spices that grew in the valley
lands everywhere the sunlight shone bring-
ing every color that nature had endowed on
this fairy-land to its fullest and best tint

   i saw the idle people sleeping in their un-
disturbed peace and even the plants seemed
too lazy to waft with the recurring motion of
the breeze it was the perfect place it was
the place to live

  and when we finally reached home tati
too was asleep in a hammock swung under
the climbing flowers that bordered her porch
she reposed her wonderful face seemed
wreathed in the smile of a beautiful dream
and i approached and kissed her as a mother
would kiss her sleeping child

   she awoke with a little start and looked at
me then she held out her arms

   would you do me a favor  i asked

  i would do anything for you my me-
rita she replied


the man who wasnt game



   ask akipo to return to the village and
tell the stranger at whose cottage  stopped
that i cannot accept his proposition

  what do you mean she asked a little
startled her eyes seemed to say that she
feared something had come into our lives that
might part us

   i will tell you i said  only please
send akipo just say this to him tell
the old man who lives in the cottage where you
stopped this morning that the american can-
not accept his proposition 

  she called to the native and in the beauti-
ful language of her land gave my wish
akipo evidently thinking that he could make
faster progress than the horse started off
afoot

  i told tati all that had happened i ad-
mitted frankly that i was committing the
nasty underhanded crime of breaking my
word after i had given my promise not to
do so but i admonished her that i only did
so because i loved her better than all else in
this world and that if she loved me as she
said she did she would keep the old mans se-
cret with me

  she told me that it did not interest her
sufficiently to give it another thought we
changed the subject and set about preparing
for the trip to her fathers where i was to be
formally presented as his future son-in-law

  it was our intention to start early the next
day tati and i were to ride horseback as
far as poora a native settlement near the sea
then we would embark in a rowboat with
six lusty men at the oars in this boat we
were to live for three days-the length of time
needed for the journey

  while we were packing what few belong-
ings we required for the trip akipo returned
he told tati who acted as translator that
pennzer wanted to see me at once i tried
to gather from akipo some inside idea of
the nature of the old mans demand but
akipo only seemed to be aware of the one
request-that the old man had to see me that
moment

  i felt that i at least owed him the courtesy
of a decent reply so i went to his cottage
with akipo to guide my footsteps i found
him seated on the little porch he bade me
enter and ordered akipo to stay outside

  once inside he locked the door as before
and said to me

   the native brought me your answer but
i want it direct from you

  he didnt seem angry so much as hurt

  i simply cant do what you ask i said

  why he ventured

    i really dont care to mix in your case
i replied  in the first place i do not think
that i could do you any good service

    and in the second 

  there was no particular reason why i
should beat around the bush

   i have decided to stay here i like
moona i am going to make it my home
i said

  he was visibly disappointed he raised
his hand to his forehead and wiped away the
perspiration gathered there in great drops i
saw the tears come into his eyes he seemed
to be unable to speak

    caught in the spell he said his voice
choking with emotion my bov how many
have been caught in this wonderful island
spell but you will regret it you will live
to see the day when you will regret it with all
your heart you will long for your own coun-
try and the advantages it will give you all
this sunshine this laziness these women-

  he stopped and looked at me sharply

   these women he went on  will grow
old and their beauty will pall you then
you will long for your own kind and they
are false they are wicked there isnt one of
them whom you would want to make your
wife

    hush i said interrupting him there

is

  give her up he shrieked give her
up you will regret it come i will do
more than i said i will give you twenty
thousand dollars if you will go back to amer-
ica and convince the bank to do as i say
all that i want is my freedom i will give
you the money now

  ere i was aware he had run into the ad-
joining room before i could say aught he
was dragging the bag of notes from its hi-
ding-place

  now he was before me his nervous fingers
opening the lock

  put it back i shouted i want none
of it

    you must take it  he shouted in answer
 you must help me get my freedom

   he took up a roll of the bills nervously

  no i said and made for the door

  just as i was putting my hand on the
crude lock there was a tapping on the out-
side

   i stopped short

  the tapping came again

  i turned to pennzer he was returning the
bills to the bag

  a voice-gentle and soft-was heard out-
side it was very indistinct


the railroad mans magazine

   then the rapping again and then the voice
now louder it was tatis voice

  pennzer heard her a sarcastic smile
played over his face

    so there is the reason why you are going
to stay ha ha he laughed derisively
so there is the reason why you are going
to stay-the princess tati  -

   regardless of what he might think setting
aside the decorum that prevents a man from
opening the door of his host i drew the latch
and tati entered

   there was fire in her black eyes and anger
was beaming in her face she looked at me
and then she approached pennzer and began
to upbraid him akipo heard die angry
words of his mistress and entered and a few
passing natives added to the audience

   tati and pennzer hurled abuse at each oth-
er never did i want to understand a for-
eign language so badly pennzer showed the
bad taste to give the girl two words for her
one and whatever else the row was about
i was certain diat i was the center of attrac-
tion and that tati was abusing the absconder
for wanting to take me away from her when
 thought that it had gone far enough i
walked up to tati and took her hand

  she came along willingly but she hurled
some verbal shot at pennzer as a climax

  when we were on our way to her house i
asked what she had said

   i told him diat he was a meddlesome old
man she answered  and that he had no
right to take you from me i told him also
that it might be interesting to know just who
he was anyhow and i dared him to show what
he had in his bag i said too that he might
not care to tell why he was always afraid to
speak to people-but oh i didnt even hint
that there was anything wrong witii him

  oh gentle woman how alike you are the
world over what is your secret anyhow
where in your heart of hearts is a corner
where man can hide one little word from all
the world 

  i didnt care i only smiled who on
earth could find anger in his heart for tati
one had only to see her to love her one had
only to know her to believe in her

  i met her father in due time after the
three days journey in the open boat-the six
oarsmen taking their turns as watchers and
rowers now and then offering prayers for our
safety-we arrived at the paternal home

  the father was glad to know me glad to
welcome me and glad to add me to his fam-
ily-and all because tali loved me he gave

the

 me a plantation worth a fortune in his land
 he gave me cattle and horses and he gave me
 from his bag of coins-but he gave me hap-
 pier days than i believed it possible for man
 to know because he gave me his beautiful
 daughter-the princess tati my wife

   many years have passed since the incidents
 here recorded occurred as i write i am
 sitting on the broad veranda of my home in
 that garden of the gods-moona the fairest
 of the islands that dot that sunlit ocean of
 the western hemisphere whose name is peace

   i look over the green tops of the coconut-
 trees across the vistas of my plantation
 through a valley adown whose mountainside
 flow dozens of tiny waterfalls and i see
 that ocean so wonderfully blue and calm
 kissing the long white sandy shore of my
 island home was there ever water more
 beautifully at peace with the world

 	up from the valley comes the coolest gen-
 tlest breeze filled with a hundred odors of
 rare spices far to my right tall mountain-
 peaks rise in commanding power to the skies
 and their topmost points are hidden in a veil
 of fleecy clouds and just before me on my
 own plantation the ever-blooming flowers and
 the ever-growing fruits that the almighty
 gives to the islander vouchsafe me the grand-
 est sense of contentment that life can afford

   at my side watching my pen glide over the
 paper devouring my words as i write sits
 the most glorious creature ever born-my
 little wife day by day her beauty grows
 more serene day by day her love grows
 stronger day by day i thank the fates that
 guided my erring feet to this haven of bliss-
 this wonderland of glory and happiness of
 peace love plenty and human kindness

   all ambition gone except to live and love
 all hope of the future banished for this para-
 dise of the pacific all wishes to return to
 my native land-to see my home again to
 take up my abode anew to work for a great
 name and fame-

  bah not for worlds not for glory
even had i the desire i could not i was
caught in this spell i am not game to battle
against it no i am not game

   no not for all of poor pcnnzers wealth
 would i give one thought to anything but my
 life my love and my happiness in parting
 just one word about that misguided man

   they found him one morning lying prone
on his floor with a bullet in his heart his
unspent stolen fortune-the lure that got
him-was scattered all over the room

a remarkable record for safety

by bertram adler

every little while the statement is made that american railroads are far behind
those of europe in regard to the protection of the traveling public and
figures are often quoted to throw discredit on the great systems of this
country many of whose records have stood for years unmarred by a single fatality

     the facts published in this article have been obtained from government re-
ports and other sources of a most trustworthy character and give the lie direct to
those who attempt to prove that railroad travel in this country is more perilous to
life and limb than it is abroad in fact few foreign safety records compare with
those made during the past few years by our own railroads whose up-to-date
methods of train-despatching and signaling have brought about a condition border-
ing on immunity from serious catastrophes that is almost phenomenal

figures which free travelers minds of the horror of railroad accidents
and cause them to pin their faith to the con the
shack and the eagle-eye

ailroads with terminals in
new york have recently been
calling attention to their rec-
ords in maintaining
greater safety of travel by
rail since the first of
the year the lackawanna the erie and the
pennsylvania have issued statements of this
kind

  the lackawannas figures showed that it
had not killed a passenger in ten years
though during that time it transported -
 persons the erie with  miles
of line and a trackage of  miles showed
a record of five years without a single
fatality to one of its  passengers
while the pennsylvanias statement showed

a clean bill of health for  and the latest
annual report of the lehigh valley proves
that  of its passengers were trans-
ported without a fatality

  during three years from  to  in-
clusive  companies operating 
miles of road did not kill a passenger in
  roads operating  miles of
road also kept their records clean in gather-
ing figures concerning railroad accidents in
this country statisticians are accustomed
argue the railroad men to include tramps
trespassers and other persons who are killed
while not actually traveling by rail often
they compare this list of total fatalities with
the fatalities occurring only to passengers on
european roads from such a comparison


the railroad mans magazine

the american record does not appear nearly
so good as it really is	

  as an illustration of the confusion that
may result from this method more than
 trespassers lost their lives on railroads
in the united states last year a great pro-
portion of these were tramps who were steal-
ing rides on the trucks or roofs of the cars
on one line about  trespassers were
arrested in that time and convictions were
obtained in seventy-five per cent of the cases

  the interstate commerce commission
gives the following figures on the increased
safety of railroad operation

  from ss to s the fatalities were 
in  from  to the pesent time
the fatalities were  in  a gain
in the safety ratio of over twenty per cent
the annual report of the bureau of am-
erican railway news and statistics says

a record-breaking year

  never before in the history of railways
has such a record for comparative safety been
made as that recorded of american railways
during the year ended june   of
the  companies reporting to this bureau
no less than  operating  miles
of line and carrying  passengers
went through the year without a single fa-
tality to a passenger in a train accident

   of the remaining twenty-one companies
no less than ten operating  miles and
carrying  passengers only missed
such perfect immunity by a single fatality
each this leaves eleven roads whose mis-
fortune it was to bear the burden of fatal
accident to passengers during the year
the roll of immunity includes roads in
every section of the union from maine to
california several great systems operating
over  miles of line each as well as num-
bers of little branch lines with less than ten
miles of single track lines operated with all
the safety appliances known to twentieth-cen-
tury progress and lines working under as
primitive conditions as prevailed on this con-
tinent more than half a century ago

  this record of complete immunity holds
good over a total of  miles of track
which represents a mileage nearly seven times
that of all british railroads and equals the
aggregate of all europe excluding russia
but including the british isles

  what immunity to fatalities to passengers
over such a vast mileage means may be part-
ly realized from the fact that only twice in
half a century has such a condition occurred

on the  miles of british railways and
never to the writers knowledge so far as
statistics reveal on the railways of any of
the great nations of europe

fewer passengers injured

  it would take seven consecutive years of
immunity from fatalities to passengers in
train accidents on british railways to equal
this phenomenal record of american roads

  in presenting similar returns for  at
that time it was said that considering the
myriad units of risk involved the record for
immunity from fatal accidents to passengers
is without parallel in the history of railway
operation

  how that record has been not only
equalled but surpassed is shown in the fol-
lowing statement for the last two years

  the figures given above enumerating pas-
sengers injured in train accidents are equally
illuminating as to the safety of american
railways for they demonstrate that- with the
multiplication of risks in  the number
of injured was less by  per cent the fact
that no passenger is killed in train accidents
is more or less adventitious but a reduction
in the number injured testifies to a reduction
in the opportunities for fatalities

poorer records abroad

  during the last ten years the average of
passengers injured in jrain accidents on
british railroads has been  which con-
sidering the difference in the units of risk is
 per cent higher than the above record
for  miles of american railway in
 the following table which includes no
less than six great systems of over

to the ten roads whose record for safety to
passengers in train accidents is marred only

a remarkable record for safety



  these figures show a trackage of s
miles greater than all the railways of the
united kingdom approximately one - half
the passenger mileage and over three times
the ton mileage with only ten passengers
killed in train accidents to an average of
twenty on british railways during the last
ten years

   further analysis of the returns to the bu-
reau since data along this line have been
compiled affords the following statement of
the number of roads and their mileage that
have records of entire immunity from fatali-
ties to passengers in train accidents of from
one up to six years

                            number of  miles of 
                            companies line    
six years  to               
five years  to             
four years  to            
three years  to   s        
two years  to            
one year            
long periods of immunity

  gratifying and remarkable as was the im-
munity from fatalities of the class under
consideration in  the fact that for a
period of five years ninety - five american
roads with a mileage practically double that
of all british railways have carried hun-
dreds of millions of passengers without a
fatality to one of them is so at variance
with the popular impression regarding the
dangers of american railway travel as to
seem little short of marvelous

  the impressive character of this showing
will be better appreciated when it is under-
stood that the immunity from fatalities in
train accidents represents a number of con-
secutive years counting back from 
no road has been admitted to the list where
immunity has been interrupted by a single
accident with this fact in mind the clean
slate of the seventeen roads for six yars chal-
lenges admiration especially as the bureaus
reports in  covered less than two-fifths
of the operated mileage of the united states

  it is estimated that the railroads of the
united states carried an average of -
 people per year for the last ten years
and in a single year they hauled one and one-
half billion tons of freight within the limits
of this country if these figures can be taken
as an index to the commercial importance of
our country we can believe that we are truly
an industrial people

  while traffic has been growing during the
last ten years so have the railroads equip-

ments thousands of miles of track have
been added and there is no comparison in
the growth of the block-signal system and the
telephone service on the roads during this
period with that of the preceding decade

   the size and power of the locomotives have
practically doubled since  and the ca-
pacity of the rolling-stock has also shown a
remarkable growth it is estimated that the
roads now employ one and one-half million
men and women to whom they pay annually
about one billion dollars in salaries

   as to the other features of our industrial
body the manufacturing interests have
shown about die same proportionate growth
in the same time and the agricultural sci-
ence has made as great progress but with
not as great an increase in the volume of
products grown no doubt the latter fact
is one of the causes of high prices many
other industries in the country however
have expanded in the same proportion during
the past ten years that transportation sys-
tems have

   figures just compiled by the pennsylvania
railroad system show that in  and 
its various lines carried a total of -
 passengers on its  miles of track
and only one passenger was killed as a result
of a train-wreck in other words the chance
of a passenger losing in an accident on the
pennsylvania railroad system was one out
ofabout 

   the pennsylvanias safety records

   in  the number of passengers carried
by the pennsylvania railroad system was
 this was an increase of 
per cent over the  carried in

	the number of passengers carried
one mile on the pennsylvania system in 
and  was  so that for each
mile traveled over that system the-chance of
a traveler being killed was one in more than
seven billion

   one passenger was killed as a result of a
train-wreck in  while none was killed
in  in the two years  passengers
were injured in train-wrecks there were
two less passenger collisions and fifteen fewer
freight collisions in  than in  while
the number of freight derailments was small-
er bv sixty-nine

   the passenger-trains on the pennsylvania
system in the past two years have traveled
 miles in other words if one
train had gone this distance it would have
made about  trips around the world


the railroad mans magazine

and with but one death resulting from a
train accident the freight-trains operated
by the pennsylvania system in the two years
traveled approximately  miles

  the pennsylvania lines west of pittsburgh
have carried issos passengers in 
and  these passengers have traveled
a total of  miles and not a single
one killed in a train accident the grand
rapids and indiana railway lias a record
equally as good as in the two years it carried
 passengers a distance of -
s miles and none were killed

other roads that fared well

  the cumberland valley railroad another
subsidiary of the pennsylvania had a train
mileage of  miles in  and 
carrying  passengers the number
of passengers carried one mile was -
 this road enjoys the distinction of
having no passengers either killed or injured
on account of train accidents no employees

were killed and only one was injured in a
wreck during these two years

  passenger traffic on the long island rail-
road is exceedingly heavy owingto its large
suburban traffic out of new york city this
road carried  passengers in 
and  but no passenger or employee was
killed in a train wreck

  the vandalia railroad operated its pas-
senger-tntins  miles in  and

	the number of passengers carried one
mile was  and not one was killed
in an accident

  the maryland delaware and virginia
railway and the baltimore chesapeake and
atlantic railway two of the pennsylvanias
subsidiaries operating steamboats on chesa-
peake bay and railways on the delaware-
maryland peninsula in the two years hauled
 passengers and not one was killed
as a result of a train accident no employees
have been killed in this way and no passen-
gers have been injured only one employee
was injured as a result of a train accident

 moving rails with magnets

new methods of loading and unloading iron and steel cargoes that is
fast becoming popular

the noteworthy results attained by the use of
lifting-magnets wherever large masses of iron
must be handled quickly and readily arc described
in an article by h g barrington in the american
exporter it shows how greatly this use has ex-
tended of late and gives an idea of the enormous
size of the masses handled by these great electro-
magnets says the writer

   for loading and unloading rails tubes and
large plaies it has been found an advantage to
operate the magnets in pairs in this manner
twenty to twenty-five rails at a time may be lifted
while nested together and dropped in the exact
location desired without disturbing their arrange-
ment enabling a whole car of rails to be loaded
neatly in a few minutes

  it is in such special uses of the lifting-magnet
that the saving of time and labor is most marked
the grip by simple magnetic force by saving
space occupied by the old hooks and chains ena-
bles the magnet to do work which is impossible to
the old method as for example the close and ac-
curate piling of rails and structural steel without
rehandling

  the magnet may be used advantageously in
loading and unloading large quantities of loose
scrap matted masses of scrap-iron lathe chips

and the like at a profit in the handling whereas the
labor cost under the old qiethod would be prohibi-
tive the cost of handling iron and steel is from
five to fifty cents per ton according to the nature
of the material the use of lifting-magnets cuts
down this cost about ninety per cent

   other interesting special uses are in handling
iron and steel goods packed in cases and barrels-
such as kegs of nails-notwithstanding the wood
between the magnet and the metal to be lifted an
extra margin of electric power being provided to
make up for the absence of direct contact between
the magnet-poles and the load in handling finished
machinery where injury would result from the con-
tact of hooks and chains in shipbuilding as a sup-

hoop and his hobbies

by b a kobelt

             the siamese twins fun and frolic have
             some  pulls  that do not materialize

high aim and low luck were ever
etched on a fair face that face
belonged to luke lomas ex-sig-
nalman and prospective key-wiz-
ard his bally bent to be with
you in a frolic had made gaps in
his career bilked his ambition nd left him
the endless material with which to widen
your smile and dash your credulity

  when i tracked up with him he still as-
pired to the presidency of the road but he
had taken this for his motto

  every excess is a defect and dont you
forget it

  as we mulled on a truck at jefferson junc-
tion with old sol doing business like an
oven he delivered that pill for the nineteenth
time it didnt cheer me we were both due
at new jobs in sheboygan that evening but
we couldnt make it-not by the finest calcu-
lation nor the swiftest air-ship

 r r

  so we fought disgust and ennui with ci-
gars and newspapers-which wouldnt work
time hung round our necks like eternal mill-
stones and i longed for something to murder
the tedium

  some extra puckers in lukes fair phiz set
me wondering whether you could hit him for
one of his personal shezerades or get hit by
his edgewise- crazy bone for disturbing his
mock siesta

  beautiful kibosh all right soul-avia-
ting sentiments for them as dont know other-
wise he grumped behind a sunday supple-
ment with a sudden ripping noise it
flopped on the breeze and sailed down the
platform

  now whats biffing you i asked pass-
ing the cheer canteen with the open nozzle
 is it the variegated past or the blooming
future 

   oh these papers make me sick-plumb


the railroad mans magazine

weary of the paleozoic thoughts in the avia-
ting era he graveled  hobbies-what do
thev know about hobbies hobbies that lift
the mind above the sordid groove of worka-
dav worries oh piffle ive seen hobbies
lift men out of dieir jobs pretty close to the
booby hatch my salad days were soused
with such for instance there-

  he viewed the wicked flagon and rinsed
down some of the blue that was due to our
endless lay-over and i patted his dorsal ex-
panse to loosen up his vocabulary

   for instance there- i reminded him

   for instance there were heines and hooli-
gans who hobbied up the trouble tram to the
blue terminus of dippy regret luke
scraped his throat they hobbied until
fate handled em they hoped to hobby to
the upper seats of the temple but they hob-
bied into a hole and lomas says they were
ambitious and luke lomas is a fun-toler-
able man  every excess is a defect but let
the dead past and so forth - am i getting
plain  

  not yet but soon i said

  very well then luke huffed some ge-
nial now hold your whistle while i steam
down the corridors of time to the epoch of
wild oats and green hobbies and a sunny sock
called hoop imagine the same and yours
spielfully going the slow rural pace on the
g n near the village of bock yanking le-
vers in a high-glass observatory hoisting or-
ders on a hoop to the flying moguls and
banking up nothing or less

  we were both ambitious and our dinkey
tower was the chateau dlf during idle
hours gazing wishfully over an acre of cat-
tails we considered the niceness of the presi-
dency and the heftiness of getting there

   we had notes on the rail-presidents from
vanderbilt to early and we could match the
sugcess-keys right and left talk about your
talent- buried in the wildwood why for
fancy lifts hoop had your gay lotharios
and admirable crichton poked back into
shadowland he could do a merry widow
on a three-string and some lar neuveau
with a kodak took to the mesmer like a
horse to oats could train a beagle for the
acting zoo etcetera and then some

  so when trout-brooks play out in the
autumn he took a casual shine to a hobby-
the plain ordinary sort of keeping a diary
and developin films and he rid it so darn
hard it left hoofprints on the sand of time
and blue notes on my shoulder hork

  how how did this admirable liarem-
scarem do it how did acamera film and

a page of mental deposits bear on my figured
career and make me wait on a siding of nix-
prosperity 

   right theres the nut on which the fates
swiveled the nut was hobbies and the mutt
was hoop and  every excess is a defect and
dont you forget it when youre hit by am-
bition now am i getting plain

  plain as plunks at the english derby
but keep up the pressure i said

  you see luke went on while hoop
had hobbies he also had theories one of
them concerned how you can never reach the
summit in the railroad game without a pull
from the super thats why he two-stepped
over the landscape to that nine-piece town
called bock some more than was good for
him the objective-points being jim orouke
sally hames eddie graney and other lights
of the rural rampage

  jimmy orouke being the gay chinner
and first cousin to the superintendent of the
division hoop discoursed loud and long on
the possibility of his influence till we plum
forgot that we be such stuff as dreams are
made of and realize that our little lives are
yanked around by foolish bubbles

  hoop had a genius for drawing unto
himself a lot of friends near-friends and
nix-friends and speaking in epitome he
was the hub of the world at bock i was
the axis of the job and the prop of the follv

     back with the big blarney but a little
rose for jimmy orouke and its us for a
chance with the big super he used to yoddle
to himself coming back from the gay doings
where he was the only aeroplane in sight

   being always there with the prize wag
and the brown kodak he got the come-again
sign from every corner and by and by jim-
my had him booked to meet the super at a
cream town stag-party i figured that when
the super had pulled hoop hoop would pull
me but hang the fatal error and the hoodoo
of the hobbies which in a single night hum-
bled us to the brown earth that clings to the
farm-trolleys  every excess is a defect and
dont you forget it am i getting plainer

   sure i said

  you see one night as i stuck by the
phone and the semaphore hoop came home
from a quilting bee that had turned into a
cider fete and the funny fit got into his giz-
zard so bad that i thought hed keel over in
the trap-hole he particularized on the fun-
ny side of a frenchy event and by and by

i do mirth-jigs myself and wind up with
the fatal remark  fine superfine stuff for
your diary 
hoor and his hobbies



   prompt as rockets hoop anchors up with
his day-book and hen-tracks the following
deacon white and widow buie have as-
cended from the vale of years to enjoy some
spoony moments behind the rope portieres
none of the nectar escapes love is an in-
stinct that elevates the mind above the mun-
dane miss minnie binnie drawn by a
smile from the only pebble she proceeds in
a blind hurry and leaves white kid
pumps in the mundane fish salad	-

eddie graney esquire with mamie
mingles hair-puffs tangled on his
cuff-links gives similar signs of re-
ciprocating love after which the
dear good wife is the storm center
the sirens vamose and the fete is
over for the rest of the day

fine and dandy youve got

   he dropped the film between the leaves
of his diary which he always carried in his
outer coat-pocket

  now jimmy was booked to marry sally
hames come friday next and we were both
on the gala go-list the rice was ready and
our toofins sharp for the spice-cake

  but nix hobbies stalled the hymenial
special fate rung the curtain down on the

she raged at the film and then

            her trousseau

tore up

the literary lights squeezed into a tomb i
said to hoop who was moist in his- eye
then he showed me a film containing tw
heads of opposite gender in ambrosial em-
brace and tender lip-meetings

  jimmy orouke and ella braney  i
whistles  and jimmy soon a happy bene-
dict by george and janus 

    the sqme laughs hoop  they were
sitting on a rock when i snapped the shut-
ter but not for a farm would i let jim
know it

wedding and up on a biffing-match - and
heres how the hobbies did it

   the day before the ceremony hoop ha-
stened over to bock as right-hand-help for
jimmy in pop harness parlor he leans
back in a chair and the diary dips out of
his pocket sally gets her finger on it and
hustles up to the boudoir the film drops
out and sally drops down

    a outrage a black outrage  she
raged at the film when hoop was gone and
then she tore up her trousseau scandalized


the railroad mans magazine

the minister who in turn was scandalized
by his name in the diary and the whole
town riz up and had a banshee musicale
with spitfire interludes

  worse and still worse from all points
of the compass they turned the sass-hose on
jimmys character and when he saw the
film and gets on to the ruction he steams
over to us to obliterate our nerve-force

  what happens everything happens
the universe does a buck-and-wing and
jimmy orouke does the prize punt  our
plexus

   hoop worked at night and long about
twelve a sudden skitter of glass and a high
g squeal made my hair curl sideways i
swing out of bed and up the ladder but a
cowhide got ahead of me and i took a dive
through the ether my shoulder-hock lit on
a nice five-cornered nigger-head and the rest
was green stars and catherine wheels

  when i came to hoop groaned because
he couldnt get at the levers and i groaned
back that i couldnt being dead as a door
nail so the milk-van special went crashing
to her near-doom and our luck was spoiled
forever talk about the hard blow to my
amiable animated alter ego who figured on
a pull from jimmys cousin and talk about
my mad was i to blame for the hoodoo
of the hobbies i was only a pal in whole-
some fun but you see  every excess is a
defect  in everything

  later on jimmy salvaged hoops teeth
for fifty dollars so nothing was lost save
and honor and the right-of-path to the
pay-car the wayfaring license came the
very next day and it was us for the conva-
lescent-ward where the future seems grim
like a lava stream on a buckeye landscape-
and all due to the girlish habit of snapping
pictures and taking notes on humanity

  if hoop had let hobbies alone i might
now be a g n train-shuffler no sir none
of them genteel disturbers of lazy equilibrium
for mine i could stand the laze in the kiosk
of the khedive without lighting a pipe that
is if i wasnt ambitious

  so that was the end of the hobbies i
yawned

    xot on your silverine smoke-holder said
luke gathering speed that was the be-
ginning of the end when we left the sick-
house we stuck together like the siamese
twins kicked baggage for a year at janes-
ville and learned to manage the morse we
were extras a month and then carded up
for rockfield on the c and n w and
vowed on our very first tissue wed step firm

every day and get to the top but did we
ask hoop by long-distance

  you see with only three day-and-night
regulars four water-takes and a switch to
handle de gustibus wasnt in it and we
werent ringing down the grooves of change
with adequate eclaw life grows as flat as a
bottle of hock in the desert of gobi no
field for ambition or superfluous ideas we
had no friends to dally with

  why chiefly because the fancy fringe
of local habitations wasnt with us a bit
rockfield was bounded on the west by a
church on the east by a graveyard on the
south by a crowd of snobs who made you
feel like the stub-end of a burnt-out stogie
and we didnt choose to get in on the north
via the boozeries

   consequence for a weary while we was
the solemn fossils in the telegraphic cave
with our mettle in a state of coma but you
cant be a mull-head all the time so the
temperamental germs get busy again and
once more its hoop for the hobbies i
didnt second the motion but i was always
the jolly twin this time he idled away the
cantankerous leisure with a mail-course from
professor zarbray-zinzi

     oh chuck it that mesmer dopes too
deep for you i kept kidding him  devote
yourself to the encyclopedia britannia and
the universal problem of transportation and
dont go looking for troubles was part of
my advice

   but hoop keeps right on with the pa-
tience of a nag at a lamp-post in the market
quadrangle by the fixed squint in his right-
hand googoo i knew he was wisening fast
and certain

  now when he wasnt reading the mystic
dope he was training a lop-eared attenuated
cross between a rat-cur and a blood-beagle
it was another of his hobbies the dog was
docile and before long he would catch the
papers that were flipped from the mail-cars
and skip playfully away with our sunday
chapeau

   one evening a mysterious nob with a
rose in his lapel and a cane on his cuff drops
off a varnished special he makes friends
with the dog by twirling his cane as we
beam from the window he starts to chin

      boys he says  im billed for a rest in
the rural regions its me for the simple life
in the lap of mother nature laugh and
grow fat the md tells me but how the
battling nels this wart of a town can furnish
humor after youve mirthed in little old new
york is a nut to me
hoop and his hobbies



  why fellows you wouldnt believe it
he rattles on easy with a twirl of his cane

	but last week i scattered three thousand
red ruddocks to a few old comedians who
made me laugh as never before im a crank
on fun and wholesome folly laughter is
my elixir

   we humored the nob and watched him
swing through the dusk with his cane i also
watched new ideas crawl around on hoops
countenance he said never a word but
smiled a plenty i reckoned he forgot the
zarbray-zinzi but i reckoned wrong - all
wrong

    what the busy bust-valves  i ex-
claimed one evening seeing carlie the extra
from jackson high up on a tip-tilted lawn-
bench with a big chew of toilet-soap

   hoop feeds the frolic with occult passes
and carlie is wax to the will of the mystic
he acrobats out on top of a box car where
he goes through a clog-dance and winds up
with an airy adelaide genee that gives you
the marvels

    see here i wont be your free-show
spinning-top he blubs coming back to nor-
mal  but hoop only chuckles and with one
snap of his finger laid him out in dreamy
psychosis again this time he was the daring
carrie nation in a trail-skirt brewing
trouble in the boozeries as he chopped the
beer-stained air with the dream-hatchet my
vitals went up and down like a corn-hopper
and while hoop kept up the seance and i the
tomfool convulsions of the niirth-organs the
temperamental bee got busy again

    say lets over and humor the nabob
hoop whoops all at once  hes a big it on
the pennsy rub him right and its us for
a boost say well give this little snob-nest
a joy-fest to insert in the village annals
he squeaked with joy and waving arms car-
lie was game in two flips of the occult yours
ambitiously follows suit with presentiments

  now carlie says hoop with the
downward passes  youre a nice nifty
feminine in a hobble-skirt youre inspired
to uplift humanity in the high cause of equal
suffrage and rally this dead community to
that live and up-to-date game theres the
widow duncans peau de sole what-yer-call-
it airing on the line and as soon as you
have donned those intricate habiliments of
the intricate sex you can do a lingual mara-
thon that will irrigate humanity with new
emotions now scat and distinguish your-
self on the village plaza

  did carlie do it you bet your last
ducat he streaked down the street like a

collie off his chain when we caught up
with him he was half in and half out of a
gray umpire creation of the renaissance
pattern his fists punctuating powerful speech
before a little group that was bursting with
joy and drawing others like a store-fire
then hoop urged him on to the garden of
the nabob we stopped beneath the ever-
greens near the nabobs open-air bedroom

    yes siree dont you be doubting car-
lie yells  women are the headlight of
progress guiding man on safe tracks they
are the drive-wheels of civilization they
are everything that counts on the track to
success and universal enlightment i say
unto you non-believers that without the elec-
trical impetus of woman man would be like
a battered empty on a crooked tram

    woman the nob bumps up with sud-
den thunder  is an engine of mischief-a
baggage of whims-a air-valve of gossip 
we wonder and whisper i tootled up
to him that carlie was in a deep psychologi-
cal state superinduced by suggestion

    superinduced by gin-swigs i heard
him snort

  if woman can do all this what cant
she do in the realm of politics  carlie spills
on in the moonlight  what cant she do for
the gubernatorial festers 

  j tie it up tie it up and skedaddle
the nob yells out in anger  get out of my
yard you double darn hayseeds let a sick
man sleep and follow prescriptions  he
rises with purple passion and whacks the air
with a hickory stick

  by gash dont i know the feminine
gender havent i seen dont i know
hike i say hike 

   the same instant theres a gap in the
crowd a scared holler and the widow in a
faint on the flower-bed next the crowd on
the rampage and the air blue with words
hoop threw off the influence quick as scat
and wheeled round with a helping hand
 never mind mrs duncan he mollifies
 well salvage your dress for fifteen dollars
better be calm and forget

  fifteen dollars the widow gasps
 fifteen dollars for a haute monde creation
fresh from paris oh dear oh my  and
then gives a nervous exhibition that calls for
the padded gig and the gifted pill-mongers

  the hoodoo of the hobbies was on us
again the nob was mercury and the widow
was worse the whole town rose up like
one man rallied to the widows gown and the
nobs dyspepsia and heaped coals of fire on
us men of mystery hoop couldnt see why


the railroad mans magazine

the captain jinks he wasnt wiser he might
have known the widow would miss her dress

   well the dumfounded carlie took off his
hobble-skirt and that was the end of the
seance but not the end of our woes we
stubbed home some crestfallen and viewed
the situation from the dark-blue angle hoop
himself began to cuss the hobbies  pulls 
are nit unless you earn them  excess is
defect in everything

  when we reached the office the sounder
was giving the hurry-up signal hoop stooped
to the key and i picked up the orders for 
just then chuffv came yipping his welcome
in his canine zeal he snapped up the orders
bounced out and streaked up the right-of-
way i started after him-up and down hill
in the moonlight

  do you think that dog would stop no
sir not the fraction of a second some
dog-demon propelled him onward heading

for the end of the world as the crow flies i
quit heading when i reached a fence and
footed back-cussing hobbies all the way

  as neither recalled the orders exact and
 was tooting hoop signaled the chief and
mentioned the quandary to keep our honor
right side up he blamed the dog pretty often
but the chief cut in with a slam that frizzled
our hair having sent the duplicates he said
no more but we knew we were double-headed
by crazy luck-the chief on one side the nob
and the widow on the other

   sure enough next day it was us for the

hoop and his hobbies



long trail and the old hardships when i
packed my grip my boiler was busting and
i blew off steam on hobbies and theories i
proved to hoop how hobbies are jonahs and
charged him to remember that  every excess
is a defect and the only pull worth while is
the pull of energy

    correct you be hoop says at the end
of the homily  so we better sever our con-
nection for a year at least and be the siamese
twins no longer

  thats how hoop is professor zirla the
mystic wonder and yours spielfully a rolling-
stone on the c and n w

  ah theres our train at last yep we
will roll into jobs without fail to-morrow
mornincr

       o

  luke we shall roll up-grade to the high
hummocks of power and pay i cheerfully
said and then i patted his back for having
murdered the tedium and swung my grip

ask us

we like to be as useful to our readers as we can  but because of the great popularity of this
department we are forced to impose certain restrictions it is limited to the answering of
questions of an informative technical or historical nature only letters concerning posi-
tions will not be snswsred in this department all letters should be signed with the full name

ix setting the valves oir an outside admission in-
direct engine the marks on the valve-stem
showed -s-inch lead on the front end and
line and line on the back end this blade needs to
be shortened and supposing the rocker arms to be
the same length il we shortened the blade --inch
would not this change equalize the travel at both
ends

  	in the above illustration i do not under-
stand why you would shorten the blade just one
half the amount to affect the valve suppose for
instance you wanted to push the valve ahead --
inch why is the blade changed only one half this
or --inch if you push the lower arm ahead
--inch docs not this pull the valve back the
same amount

  	explain the laying off of a new reverse
lever quadrant

  	how is angularity of ecccntric-rods and
main-rods overcome with the stephenson link mo-
tion and the walschaert valve-gear

  	how arc driving-axles quartered how much
larger are they turned than the wheel and what arc
the pressures to force them in

  	how are smoke-stacks laid off lo have them
in perfect line with the exhaust tip-t j m
hsvre montana

  	provided that the throw of the eccentric is
equal to the travel of the valve in other words
that the top and bottom rocker arms are of equal
length the alteration of the eccentric-blade wants
always to be one-half the dimension shown on the

stem to make it simpler in the case which you
quote you have --inch in front and nothing or
line and line in the back hence if you shorten
the blade --inch you move the valve ahead that
distance reducing the front lead to one half --
inch or --inch and from line and line in the
back to an opening of --inch thus equalizing
the lead at each end

  	as above explained in all cases where the
two rocker arms are the same length the valve is
affected equally with whatever change is made to
the eccentric-blade in cases where the rocker
arms are of different lengths which is not uncom-
mon a calculation in which simple proportion or
the rule of three may be employed to arrive at
the exact amount of the change if such a design
existed where the top arm was twice as long as the
lower the valve would move twice what the blade
was shortened and vice versa when they are of
unequal lengths however the difference is slight
and experienced valvc-setters have little difficulty
in reckoning with it in making readjustments of
the blades

  	the prevailing practise years ago was to
arrange the notches so that the steam would cut
off at some full number of inches of the stroke with
the reverse lever in each one of the notches they
were then located so that the cut-off would occur
at      and  inches or at    
  and  inches of the stroke

questions

men


by the light of the lantern



   all recent practise-in fact for the past twenty
 years-provides for as many notches as there is
 room for in the quadrant this is much the best
 plan as it gives more graduations in which the
 valve-gear can be worked and it is a matter of no
 consequence in the working of an engine whether
 the steam is cut off at some full or fractional num-
 ber of inches

   in a new engine the quadrant is generally placed
 at the point designated for it with the reverse lever
 temporarily attached and by means of a temporary
 reach-rod or a blank end on the reach-rod which
 may be clamped to the lever the middle notch and
 the extreme end notches are located and laid off
 the remainder of the work is simply to add the
 remaining notches and the first quadrant can then
 serve as a template for all subsequent quadrants
 embodied in the order for the locomotives provided
 that they are of exactly similar class

   	if we would attempt the consideration of
 this particular question in the detail which it de-
 serves its ramifications would absorb the entire
 space allotted to the lantern department all we

  can say at this writing and in this space is that
 whatever distortion of the motion is produced by
 the angularity of either the main connecting-rod
 or the eccentric-rods is compensated for by offset-
 ting the saddle-pin of the link from the true center
 line of the link radius it is fully appreciated in
 this writing that if you do not know what the
 above is intended to imply the answer is negative
 but the reasons for the brevity have been given
 it is a matter of great interest in this number of
 the railroad mans magazine robert h
 rogers explains the details of the stephenson link
 as the walschaert gear fully completely and
 simply

   	this is usually done in what is called a
 quartering machine it is merely the solution of
 a right angle and could be as readily performed
 through the instrumentality of a spirit level on one
 side and a plumb-bob on the other the turning
 is practically the same size as the fit and the pres-
 sure is determined by the diameter and material of
 the wheel

   	the majority of smokestacks if not all of
 them are attached to a smokestack base or saddle
 and it merely remains to fit this latter in its proper
 position on the smoke-arch this can be done
 either by running a plumb-bob to the center of the
 exhaust orifice and chipping the saddle to coincide
 with the plumb line thereof or as is done in many
 of the locomotive works by using an adjustable
 gage which fits into the blast orifice and from which
 a perpendicular is erected from which the interior
 diameter of the stack and saddle can be calipered
 and set

 	greatly pleased if you would submit the in-
 teresting questions embodied in your letter in a
 more lucid form free from contradictory or impos-
 sible situations there are few problems that is
 from an engineering standpoint that mathematics
 or the formulas emanating from mechanical engi-

 neering cannot solve but in order to arrive at such
 results a tangible basis must be given on which to
 work

is there such a thing as a standard thread for
bolts and screws if so what is it and when
did it become standard-m a y boston

  until-about  the most common form of
thread was what is called the  v  thread it was
made sharp at both the top and bottom the
shape of the thread was almost identical with that
of the capital letter which we have offered in illus-
tration it is evident that if such a thread for one
screw is made pointed and that for another is
blunt that the nut for the one will not fit the
other accurately and also that if a nut have eight
threads to the inch it will not fit a bolt with nine
threads

  owing to the fact that for a long time no com-
mon standard had been agreed upon for the form
proportions or pitch of screws there was a
very great diversity in these respects in the screws
which had been used in the construction of locomo-
tives and other machinery in  the inconven-
ience and confusion from this cause became so
great that it attracted the attention of the franklin
institute of philadelphia and a committee was
appointed by that association to investigate and
report on the subject that committee recommend-
ed the adoption of the sellers system of screw-
threads and bolts which was devised by william
sellers of philadelphia

  this same system was subsequently adopted by
both the army and navy departments of the
united states as standard and then by the master
mechanics and master car builders associations
so that it may now be regarded and in fact is
known as the united states standard but the de-
sign is due to mr sellers and the system should
be designated by his name

cg e san francisco- such a book as

	you mention-dealing with the respective
duties of men composing a freight-train crew-
has never come under our observation in all
probability it is yet unpublished the work of
conductors flagmen and brakemen is defined in
the general book of rules issued by each railroad
the subject is scarcely of sufficient extent to war-
rant presentation in separate book form

  	since you have located the poem wanted in
a past number of the brotherhood of locomotive
firemen and enginentens magazine your shortest
cut to it would be by addressing that publication at


the railroad mans magazine

indianapolis indiana it might be possible that
they can supply you with the number containing
this poem although as a rule it is difficult to se-
cure past issues after such a long time as five years

ce o new jersey-the railroad age-ga-

	zelte new york or chicago would be the
best medium to address in regard to new roads or
new construction in general we are in doubt
whether your letter means main or trunk line elec-
trification at present operated under steam or
simply new trolley lines we have no statistics
whatever in regard to the latter and with the ex-
ception of the pennsylvanias new terminal arrange-
ments in new york do not believe that any elec-
trification on a large scale is contemplated

ae a farmington maine-the form in

	which you submit the two train orders
are not in accordance with the standard code we
do not think that any despatcher would issue them
from the form quoted however it would appear that
 b  is right in both contentions but the proper
procedure would be to go to some train-despatcher
on the boston and maine railroad which is in
your territory and ask his opinion of such orders
you will generally find these gentlemen quite will-
ing to oblige as they are always interested in prob-
lems which pertain to their business

isolated cases where an attempt has been made at
such portrayal within the covers of a single vol-
ume past numbers of the railroad mans
magazine have pretty fully described progressive
locomotive development in this country and suffi-
ciently it may be said to fully meet your require-
ments in addition to this you might secure fur-
ther information by addressing railway and loco-
motive engineering new york city new york
this latter journal has gone deeply into locomotive
volution but we cannot say that they have this in-
formation in compiled form

what causes the falling of the crown-sheet
of a locomotive while under steam-f

       g t

  the usual cause for the dropping of a crown-
sheet with the boiler under steam is low water ari-
sing from inattention on the part of the engineer or
operator the crown-shec-t is supported from the
top shell of the boiler by means of several hundred
crown stays or crown bolts these are protected
from the action of the heat by the water in the
boiler which should be at least five inches deep
on the crown-sheet

  should the water level be allowed to drop or to
leave the sheet altogether the crown-bolt heads and

cron-bolt bodies  longer have this protection
they become softened by the intense heat of the
fire should conditions be sufficiently extreme the
pressure in the boiler is sufficient to force the crown-
sheet down and away from the softened bolts men-
tioned

  at rare intervals other causes than low water
are indicated for a crown-sheet failure for instance
unsuspected defective boiler conditions through
the crown stays or braces being broken this
are indicate for a crown-sheet failure for instance
and is not likely to materialize low water is the
usual cause

tr canton ohio-there is no regular busi-

	ness in this country of photographing loco-
motives although several firms in england do
prosecute it and over there it is quite easy to se-
cure at small expense a picture of almost any type
of engine running in the british isles in this
country the large locomotive works such as bald-
wins and the american locomotive company
usually have this work done by contract with some
local photographer while a picture is always
made of one of an order of locomotives these are
only furnished to the owners or to those directly
interested all other applicants for photos are
usually charged an amount sufficient to cover the
cost of the picture these locomotive building
firms can place you in the way of getting photos
but a moments reflection will convince that it
would be scarcely consistent for them to furnish
them free of cost

rays is the most extreme case of which we have
ever heard it does not seem that this could have
been the true cause the effect of heat on rails

under practically abnormal conditions to cause any
appreciable change in the true alinement of the

culiar curvature which is described in your letter

what is the standard pay for engineers fire-
men and conductors on railroads in eng-
land-j w jacksonville texas

  the writer is almost ashamed to answer this
question in view of his intimate personal knowl-
edge and high regard for the ability and qualifica-
tions of the british railroad man but the truth
may as well be said and probably can be better
made manifest through reference to a representa-
tive run in the british isles we will select for
instance the celebrated  am london train out
of glasgow central which service is maintained
jointly by the caledonian and the london and
northwestern railways

  the section operated by the caledonian extends
from glasgow scotland to carlisle about 
miles after which the train is operated by the other
road mentioned there are no stops between glas-
gow and carlisle with the possible exception of
motherwell on flag the train consists of some

 eleven carriages a total weight behind the engine
 of some  tons on arrival at carlisle this en-
 gine and crew returns to glasgow on a similar non-
 stop run arriving about  pm or twelve hours
 from the time of departure

   now you want to know how much the engine
 crew will receive for this  miles round trip and
 while we blush to tell you all the engineer receives
 is eight shillings or  for the round trip and
 the magnificent compensation of his fireman is
 four shillings and sixpence or 

   when it is remembered that a similar run of
  miles in the united states would mean about
  for the engineer and  for the fireman it can
 be well appreciated how undervalued the services
 of these men are in the old country it is wrong
 too because it is just as hard to haul or fire a train
 there as it is here the same conditions must be
 confronted and there is the same liability of the
 unexpected

   generally speaking on english railways the
 wages of the locomotive engineers fluctuate from
  to  per week the average wage beir -
  the firemen receive less than   
 lowest sum given to engineers seven-eighths of
 the passenger conductors or guards draw from
  to  per week

   it is from an intimate knowledge of all these
 matters that the lantern department has steadfast-
 ly discouraged any and all aspirations which its
 readers may have had to embark in railroading in
 foreign lands in no country on which the sun
 shines is a railroad man better treated than in the
 united states from what has been said above
 it is far better to make hay at home than to haul
 a fast train abroad for a firemans pay and merely
 for the sake of novelty

 ha c new york-the principal divi-
  sion points where superintendents are lo-
 cated on the union pacific in colorado and
 nebraska are denver and omaha respectively

   	on the chicago burlington and quincy

lg r pineville louisiana-you need not
  wipe engines on any railroad before you
 start in firing this has been explained many
 times in this and other departments of the maga-
 zine it was suggested some three years ago in an
 article which appeared in the self-help depart-
 ment that in the instance of an applicant being
 somewhat under age it would be advisable to work
 around the roundhouse in the capacity of a wiper
 or helper until the proper time arrived to go on
 the road

   this of course was simply with the end in view
 to secure familiarity with the business through its
 atmosphere and was not by any means intended
 to imply that such a course is mandatory after


the railroad mans magazine

an extensive review we cant find any road where
previous service in some other capacity must pre-
vail although it is a fact that many master me-
chanics are in favor of such procedure

   we cannot tell you where a rule book of the
chicago rock island and pacific railroad can
be procured because diese must be receipted for
by the employee to whom issued and must be re-
turned to die company at the expiration of the term
of service there is no master mechanic at eunice
louisiana on the above road

at what speed and distance would an engine
have to be run to fill the tank

         how and where is the dipper placed
which fills the tank

   	does the fireman or the engineer operate
the dipper-s a m eachville arkansas

   	the speed is usually reduced to about thir-
ty-five miles an hour over the track troughs other-
wise the impact of the water in the scoop would
cause the water to rush violently out of the tender-
tank manhole and over the roof of the cars the
tank should be filled in one-quarter of a mile if
proper and common sense precautions are observed

   	what you term the dipper is technically
known as the water scoop and may be defined as
a device for putting water in a locomotive tender
while in motion from a trough laid between the
rails sometimes called a track-tank it consists
of a cast iron or steel-plate conduit of rectangular
cross section about  x  inches passing up
through the tender-tank and turned over at the
top so as to discharge the water downward the
lower end underneath the tender frame is fitted
with a scoop or dipper which can be lowered into
the track trough by a lever worked by hand or by-
compressed air applied in a cylinder whose piston-
rod is connected to the mechanism for raising and
lowering the scoop owing to its inertia the wa-
ter is forced up through the siphon-pipe into the
tender tank when the scoop moves through the
trough at a speed of from twenty-five to forty
miles an hour

    by the fireman who lowers and raises the
 scoop on receipt of some prearranged signal from
the engineer

what do you consider the biggest railroad in
the world and on what do you base your
claim-f b cumberland maryland

   it is generally claimed that the pennsylvania sys-
 tem of railroads constitutes the largest railroad in
 the world for that reason the following statistics
 issued under date december   will be of
 interest the records show that the length of the
 railroad is - miles of which  miles
 are east of pittsburgh and erie pennsylvania and
 the remainder  miles is west of pittsburgh
 the lines run through fourteen states in which
 live more than one-half of the ninety million people
 in the united states the system has 
 miles of first track  miles of second track
  miles of third track and  miles of

fourth track it also has the enormous trackage of

j

jr virginia city nevada-it is difficult to

	venture an explanation for a derailment at
this long range because the majority of these acci-
dents are quite puzzling and require a thorough
study on the ground of both the engine and the
track from your description of the engine at
fault in which you mention excessive flange wear
or cutting of the right back driving-tire it would
appear that the preliminary move in looking to-
ward a solution would be to measure the spacing of
the tires on each pair of wheels in relation to one
another that is to measure across the engine be-
tween the inside faces of the tires on each pair of
wheels on a -- engine such as referred to
this dimension should be j inches for numbers

	and  pair of drivers and j inches for number

	pair or the main wheels if these measurements
are approximated to and the engine is properly
squared across the various pedestal jaws there re-
mains nothing else to do but make thorough inquiry
into the condition of the track particularly so far
as regards the elevation of the outside rail and the
spread of the gage on the curve from this dis-
tance the matter looks like a case of improper tire-
setting but a close scrutiny of local conditions will
be found of far more value than mere conjecture

ce b emporium pennsylvania - your

	scheme for revolutionizing the present
method of supplying locomotive boilers with wa-
ter does not carry any particular appeal the fact
should always be borne prominently in mind in
connection with american locomotive practise at
least that the complication of already adequate de-
vices for the sake of some visionary benefit has
never received much encouragement there is
nothing new in the idea of having the air-pump ex-
haust heat the water in the tank but it would be
very new indeed if some one would arise to point
out any good which resulted from the practise the
addition of a pump on the tender to the existing
appliances would be unnecessary and the substitu-
tion of the pump for one of the injectors would
entail a much greater steam drain on the locomo-
tive boiler than that now imposed by both injectors
even though both were working at the same time
we gather quite clearly the idea on which you are
working but the plan impresses us as being too
cumbersome and with no certainty of better results
than under the present arrangement

ten thousand miles by rail

by gilson willets

special traveling correspondent of the railroad mans magazine

when our traveling correspondent sailed down the broad placid bosom of the
mississippi river aboard a steamer laden with brotherhood men and their
wives and sweethearts-the days bright and sunny and the nights warm
and starry and everything making for peace and happiness-well he wafted into
that atmosphere that made omar khayyam and other literary gents of the glad old
days write for a living in such a crowd and under such conditions little wonder
that the stories came thick and fast

no -with the brotherhood boys

the friscos hall of fame-a male delilah-saved by a thumb-the van-
ishing thousand-getting even with the super-how fatty
mcbride appeared in the role of an actor

yes sir you want to see our freight-
ages at the terminal station his name is
george washington

this time the southerner swept marc
antonys face with a startled look

 ah his name is george washington is
it and hes the freight-agent at the ter-
minal station might i ask you sir to tell
me how i am to get to that station  

marc antony knocked on the counter and
a colored porter came forward

 cassar said antony  go to the corner
with the gentleman and put him on the right
car for the terminal station

 pardon me sir said the colonel  did
i hear you call this black man csesar  
yes sir his name is julius caesar
well then sir look here this thing
has reached the limit i perceive that the
frisco system employs only men from the
hall of fame

thats true sir responded the city pas-
senger-agent with a twinkle in his eye he
expected now to hear the colonel protest
against the freshness of frisco employees
in general and to assert the belief that the

scries began in june railroad mans magazine single copies jo cents



        soutfierner in the regula-
tion frock coat black slouch-
hat black string-tie white
plaited shirt - bosom and
speckled-gray goatee strode
into the newly opened offices
of the frisco system in new orleans and
stepped up to the man behind the counter
he said

  at the solicitation of the soliciting agent
of this railroad a gentleman named napoleon
bonaparte hoskins sir i shipped a car of
goods over your line to this city it has
been delayed in transit sir and ive come
yere to ask about it

  you gave the business to the right per-
son replied the man behind the counter
napoleon bonaparte hoskins is all right
but at this end sir i am not the man you
want to see im the city passenger-agent
here my name is marc antony

  the colonel viewed marc antony sharply
oh so your name is marc antony is it
well mr marc antony as youre not the
man i want to see will you be kind enough
to direct me to the right person


the railroad mans magazine

names given were not the
right names of the men in
question and that he did not
purpose to be joshed or jol-
lied instead of a tirade of
this sort however the vis-
itor surprised city passen-
ger agent marc antony and
porter julius casar by say-
ing

   i repeat this thing has
reached the limit i give my
business to an agent of your
road whose first names are
n a p o  e o n bonaparte i
come to your new orleans
office to ask about the delay
of my car-load of goods and
i meet a passenger - agent
named marc antony i am then told by
marc antony that he is not the person to
answer questions about freight and that i
must go to a terminal station and see a freight-
agent named george washington i then
hear antony command a porter to put me on
a car for the terminal station and the porters
name is julius casar therefore sir i re-
peat this thing has reached the limit i
shall ship no more goods by this line here-
after i shall ship by some other line

  why sir whats the matter with the
frisco

  whats the matter well with all your
bonapartes and antonys and washingtons
and csesars i allow sir that youre all dead
ones im going to give my business here-
after to a line that employs live ones 

  the mississippi river steam-packet on
which i heard the above story was the john
spreckus she pulled out from the levee at
the foot of canal street new orleans one
sunday evening carrying seven railway-
derk-two from the illinois central two
from the yazoo and mississippi valley one
from the southern pacific one from the texas
and pacific and one from the frisco sys-
tem among themselves they were known as
men from the eye-see the yazoo the espee
the tepee and the frisco

   i had boarded the steamboat with three of
them for an evening sail up the father of
waters the other four joined us soon after
the boat pulled away from the levee

   weve chartered this boat for a special
night excursion one of the clerks said to
me  youd better come along therell be
about five hundred railway-clerks on board
that night

  the boat had been chartered by the illi-
nois central division of the brotherhood of
railway clerks of the crescent city

  were about seven hundred strong just
on the eye-see in this city they said
weve got a splendid organization and the
eye-see is very good to us chips in and
helps us royally

his name was delilah

   tell him that samson story frisco about
that section foreman up at crowley said one
of the clerks here it is

  ferguson todd section foreman frisco
system crowley louisiana had muscles that
stood out on his arms like sandows and hair
that fell over his collar like buffalo bills
his men stared in admiration at his muscular
development but upon his overgrown mane
they heaped contumely but todd absolutely
refused to get a hair-cut entertaining the
belief that somehow the mane had some-
thing to do with the muscle

  it came to pass however that todd was
invited to a dance to be given by a division
of one of the railroad brotherhoods in
crowley

  you shore will have to clip about a yard
off those locks ferg said one of his friends
or no gal will trip the lightfantastic with
you gals wont do no  merry widow  steps
with a freak

  but protested todd supposin the
hair-cut should rob me of my strength like
it did to that man we learned about in
sunday-school only yesterday down the
track on the maxie ranch i took up a seven-
hundred-pound rail and stood it on end
ten thousand

miles by rail



dyou suppose i could
do that after gettin a
hair-cut 

   sure ferg youll
be our samson just the
same

   but supposin the
barber should prove to
be my delilah

   ferg we all know
that the hair of your
head aint got no more
to do wit h your
strength than the hair
of your face you
shave every other day
dont you well sha-
ving the hair offn
your face doesnt re-
duce your liftin powers does it

  the dance was to take place on saturday
night ferg todd with fearful misgivings
and with a look suggestive of terror entered
a barbej-shop a little later he came out
with hair no longer than that of any other
man on the section gone were his buffalo
bill locks and todd felt like blubbering
what if he had lost his strength he re-
solved to test the effect of that hair-cut at
once

  with hope for the best surging in his
breast he walked down the track till he came
to where that seven-hundred-pound rail lay

   i stood this rail on end yesterday with
long hair he told himself  can i do it
now with short hair here goes

  he seized hold of the rail up it came
free of the ground he smiled happily the
muscles stood out on his arms up still fur-
ther went the rail till he had the end of it
on a level with his thigh

  its dead easy he muttered hair
aint got nothin to do with it at all

  but just then alas his strength gave out
as suddenly as if he had been stricken with
paralysis collapsing in his tracks the rail
fell across him breaking his leg

  that evening at the dance all the brother-
hood men and the ladies too asked what
had become of ferg todd the section fore-
man the friend who had induced todd to
get his hair cut assured everybody that ferg
would show up adding that the section fore-
man had had his hair clipped purposely to
come to the dance in presentable shape

  when the dance broke up at dawn on
sunday morning ferg todd had not put in
an appearance

  about eight oclock that sunday morning

two sons of one of fergs section-hands were
walking up the frisco track when suddenly
they heard a voice shouting for help seeing
a man lying helpless on the ground with a
rail across his legs they rushed to him

  why mr todd the boys exclaimed
 whats happened  

   pry this rail off me and ask questions
afterward replied the foreman he told
the boys to go to a near-by tool-box and fetch
a couple of claw-bars he then showed them
how to ease up the rail with the bar pres-
ently he was free from the terrible weight

   how long have you been lying here mr
tood   the boys asked

  since five oclock last night-fifteen
hours of fierce sufferin get some help
cause your uncle todd cant move by his
lonesome

  one evening six weeks later todd came
limping out of the hospital no longer the
strong man of the frisco system limping
from the hospital direct to the barber-ship
where he had his hair cut he stepped up to
the tonsorial artist and shaking his fist cried
 hang you i ought to wring your neck
your names delilah shelpme im going
to let my hair grow now right down to my
feet then im going to come to this here
boudoir and tear your barber-chairs up by
the roots with one hand and wipe up the
floor with you with the other your names
delilah

saved by a thumb

  the tepee man obligingly entertained us
with this

   only the other day he said  i met a
lot of espee clerks in a lunch-room on canal
street one of them said

  whats an alligator a fish or an ani-
mal or a vegetable or what 

    what do you want to know for   i
asked looking as if i knew all about alli-
gators and didnt want to tell

     why he replied  weve one entire car-
load of alligators going out on our road to
los angeles what puzzles us is how to
apply the rate now if alligators are fish
or shell-fish the charge for the car-load will
be about five hundred dollars well are
they fish  

    fish nothin put in another espee man
 alligators are live stock you just apply
the rate for live stock and youll be all right
  weve thought of that returned the first
espee man  but somehow it doesnt seem to
apply with exactitude however if the alli-
gators are rated as live stock then the freight

-suh  did you call

caesar  


the railroad mans magazine

will be over six hundred dollars what do
you say eye-seer he added turning to me

   i looked exceeding wise and making a
wild guess said with the supreme convic-
tion of the accuracy of my statement

    youre both wrong alligators are nei-
ther fish nor live stock alligators are  ani-
mals not otherwise specified and the rate
should be applied to them as such

    hanged if he isnt right said the first
espee clerk  ill just spring that on our
rate-man as the product of my own big head
next day at luncheon i againmet the
same espee men in the same lunch-room
one said to me

   hanged if our rate-man didnt bill that
car of alligators as animals not otherwise
specified he liked that classification be-
cause the freight under that head amounted
to about nine hundred dollars thus raising
fish four hundred and live stock three hun-
dred whenever we get in a muddle like that
again eye-see well come to you 

a parson was hurt in an eye-see wreck
and was given five thousand dollars in set-

vou will have to clip about a yard off those locks

tlement of his claim a year later the eye-
see claim-agent at new orleans received a
letter from the parson enclosing a check for
four hundred dollars the letter stated that
the writer had been laid up for one year
hence losing his pulpit salary of two thou-
sand dollars his medical expenses amounted
to seven hundred and fifty dollars his
board at a sanatorium eight hundred and
fifty incidental expenses incurred as the
result of the injury one thousand dollars
balance on hand four hundred dollars which
he now returned

  whereupon the eye-see rewarded the
minister for his honesty by returning the
check and asking him to keep it as a present

  by return mail came another letter from
the parson saying thanks for your check
for four hundred dollars have donated it to
the disability funds of the local divisions of
the railway brotherhoods

   by the time the eye-see claim-clerk fin-
ished telling this story of the conscientious
parson our steamboat was passing the great
stuyvesant docks so named in honor of stuy-
vesant fish then president of
the i c through whose enter-
prise the docks were built

   reminds me of a story of
mr fish which i know to be
true said the same eye-see
claim-clerk just before mr
fish resigned the presidency of
the illinois central a great
number of claims had been pre-
sented by people along our line
in kentucky who said that our
trains had killed their horses
every one of the claimants
stated that his horse was posi-
tively the bluest blood in ken-
tucky regardless of the kind of
scarecrow it might have been

  mr fish heard of these
claims from time to time and
finally he uttered this sage re-
mark 

by george ive lived
long enough to learn that abso-
lutely nothing so improves the
breed of horse-flesh in kentucky
 as to cross a horse with a loco-
motive for heavens sake
lets cease crossing kentucky
horses with locomotives

    that reminds me said an-
   other clerk  mr fish was
   himself a brakeman once did
   you fellows know that
ten thousand miles by rail



   sure

   and any man who swung a lantern could
get his ear any old time he believed in the
square deal and always took a personal in-
terest in the men and once he showed his
interest this way

  up st louis way there was a brakeman

   i am mr fish you want to speak with
me you are a brakeman i know it by
the way you got over that rail come in-
side

  mr fish led the way into the car and
there mitchell quickly told his story

  i see mr fish said what you want

named mitchell he and the train-despatch-
er had a falling out about something they
didnt understand each other and the brake-
man was fired

  he went to his home-a little place be-
tween st louis and chicago

  a few days later a passenger-train with a
private car attached pulled into that little
place mitchell recognized the car as the
one always used by mr fish straightway
he walked down to the car and found a
number of men sitting on the rear platform
mitchell didnt know the eye-see president
when he saw him he said simply

   is mr stuyvesant fish up there  
  yes replied a tall man

  i would like to speak to him

  all right come aboard

  mitchellclimbed over the rail and the
tall man said

    rr

is fair play you shall have it go back to
st louis and report for duty it will be all
right by the time you get there

mr fish penned a telegram to the des-
patched ordering him to reinstate mitchell
mr fish then gave mitchell a cigar saying
 i suppose you know that i have swung
a lantern myself

   yes sir i understand mitchell an-
swered

the vanishing coin

speaking of fifty cents reminds me said
another eye-see clerk of that long-un-

sam reached up and pulled down the sack
and dropped it in his pail of water


the railroad mans magazine

solved mystery of the disappearance of a sack
of money from the pacific express car it
contained a thousand dollars in fifty-cent
pieces and the mystery of its disappearance
was cleared up only the other day-through
die cleverness of an eye-see railway clerk

  an eye-see train with a pacific express
car attached stood in the union station
new orleans ready to pull out in the ex-
press-car were several sacks of silver coins
among which was one containing one thou-
sand dollars in fifty-cent pieces these bags
of money had been shipped by a local bank
and were consigned to banks in the northern
part of louisiana

   the express messenger in charge of the
car was making things shipshape for the
journey when suddenly he missed that thou-
sand-dollar sack of half-dollars

     its gone  he gasped

   calling to the station-men the express
clerk communicated the horrifying news

   somebody had stolen a thousand dollars
from under his nose

    i handled it-right on that table-only
a moment ago  he declared  how could
it vanish like that i havent been out of
the car a minute since weve been here 

   the superintendent of the pacific ex-
press at new orleans mr maunch was told
what had happened and he immediately put
a number of eye-see special officers on the
case months passed and not a single clue
was found

   in february however a certain eye-see
railway clerk happened to hear that a negro
named george johnson was riding around
new orleans in a new buggy the clerk
was further told that the negro had paid cash
for the buggy and for the horse too in half-
dollars

     let me see said the clerk to the livery-
man who gave him this information
 george johnson was a car-cleaner on the
eye-see some months ago he was dis-
charged was he not 

    yes his father died just then how-
ever and george received some money for a
life-insurance policy thats where he got
the money for the horse and buggy

   the eye-see clerk went home and wrote
an anonymous note to mr maunch saying
that a certain colored man named george
johnson living in fourth street would bear
investigation regarding the missing sack of
half-dollars

  within two hours after receiving that
note mr maunch had johnson lodged in
jail after having secured a full confession

  johnson while on his car-cleaning job
had passed the open door of the express-car
he saw a sack tagged   seeing also
that the express clerks back was turned he
reached up pulled down the sack and
dropped it into his pail of water then saun-
tered on

    got any of the money left  asked mr
maunch

    no boss replied sam with a gleeful
chuckle  ah done spend the last one of
them half-dollars last night feedin pok-
chops and tamales to members of that there
colored burlesque troupe  

a real boss

  two weeks after my sail up the mississippi
i arrived in st louis there i met  pop 
orrison of iowa an ex-engineer of the min-
neapolis and st louis railway who told
how certain divisions of his brotherhood had
chartered a mississippi steam-packet for an
excursion up the river on that trip  pop 
orrison told this old-timer story which i
repeat herev

  the old louisville railroad-the l m
and b dubbed the lame mangy and
blind - had for master mechanic james
vintin commonly known as uncle jim
uncle jim was jeally the railroad he ran
it he bossed it what he said went he
accomplished this feat through sheer force
of rightbacked by might

  a just man was uncle jim big and
strong always ready to give the men a square
deal he was a fighter who enforced his
rulings for a square deal with formidable
fists

  when excited uncle jim had a habit of
closing his thumbs tight to his fists and then
spitting on them

  under uncle jim was an engineer who
had red hair and was generally called  red-
head he was the most reliable the very
best engineer on the road

  one day uncle jim received an order from
the superintendent dick carron to dismiss
the red-haired throttle-handier whereupon
uncle jim in great wrath called red-
head into his office and said

  look here you flame-headed imp youre
not fired yet but youre going to be unless
you tell me the truth about the matter men-
tioned in this writing he handed the en-
gineer the superintendents letter

   red-head  told his side of the story
satisfying uncle jim that a square deal was
not being handed out by the superintendent
ten thousand miles by rail



grasping red-heads arm in a vise-like
grip uncle jim hauled him over to the super-
intendents office

  look here said uncle jim addressing
the superintendent and spitting vociferously
upon his two thumbs im going to show
you that you aint runnin this road to suit
yourself im going to convince you that you
cant fire my men when theres no justice
in it

  during this speech uncle jim had ad-
vanced across the room toward the super who
had retired with terror-stricken face into a
far corner

  yes sir im going to pitch you head-
first out of that window announced uncle
jim as he spat some more on each thumb
i say youre going to meet your hereafter
right now through that there window

   with that he picked up the terrified super
in his two brawny arms and carried him to
the window

  just then the entire office force hearing
the scrimmage fell upon uncle jim and
begged him to spare the su-
pers life

    i will listen to you said
uncle jim if this clam called
a man will order my red-headed
engineer reinstated this minute

otherwise- and he shoved
the super half out of the window

    yes yes  gasped the super

your engineer may remain at
work

  uncle jim pulled the super
back into the room and dropped
him in a heap on the floor

then turning to  red-head
he said

   go back to work you half-
witted bumblebee how dare
you put the superintendent of
this railroad to all this bother

get on your engine and pull out
of here quick 

  what ive just told you of
the uncle jim story said pop

 was as far as i told it to the
io-way boys that day of the
excursion now youd think
railroad men would want to
know how it happened that the
master mechanic of a road could
run the whole shooting match
even to threatening the life of
the super for discharging one of
the men but no these io-way
boys didnt ask me a single why

   were in missouri now however and i
suppose you want to be shown well sir the
road hadnt any money that explains un-
cle jims cinch the company owed uncle
jim a whole lot of salary and didnt dare
try to fire him without first paying him

  as the result of this shortage of cash
something interesting happened not long after
that day when uncle jim bullied die super
into reinstating the red-headed engineer

    red-head said uncle jim one morn-
ing as the engineer was about to pull out
 maybe a man will board you to-day some-
where down the line he will show you a
bit of paper and affirm in the name of the
state of kentucky that your machine is seized
for taxes this is a warning to you not to
come back here without your engine-under-
stand you bring this machine back 
here uncle jim paused and spat on his
thumbs then he added

    if you come back without this engine
ill thrash you to a pulp after which ill fire
you without a cent of all the wages due you

he picked up the terrified helper and carried
him to the window


the railroad mans magazine

   all day the master mechanic waited anx-
iously for  red-heads  return about dark
sure enough the red-headed engineer re-
turned in his cab all hunky

    did you-all have any trouble  asked
uncle jim

     should say i did replied the engineer
im a delinquency

    youre a what  thundered the master
mechanic

  im a delinquency a one-legged
man says i am he said that therefore i
am also a  misdemeanor  and a  writ of
attachment 

    a one-legged man  who was he  

    hes the man you said would board me
with papers and would seize the machine for
taxes well mr vinfin he did it just as
you said he held me up for about ten
minutes when id been seized and learned
that i was a  delinquency  and all those
other things the conductor sudden gave me
the signal to pull on did i pull on bet
you

     i forgot to tell you mr yintin  red-
head  continued  that there were four other
men assistin the one-legged man in the seiz-
ure when i got the signal to move on i
pulled the lever beiore any of those five men
could stop me then i motions to my fire-
man to kick out the water-glass he does it
quick as a wink-and there was the worst
racket in the way of an explosion you ever
heard of that scared the one-legged man
and the others so they didnt tarry a moment
to maintain the seizure they just called
me a delinquency some more and also a
 resister of the law and then they aban-
doned me any old way they could

    the one-legged man left his crutches
behind which i now have the honor to pre-
ent to you as a trophy and heres your
engine you can get some one else to run
her im resignin without pay

     youre going to resign are you  bel-
lowed uncle jim  after i nearly com-
mitted homicide on the super to keep you on
the job youre now going to quit me are
you well then im going to prepare you
for the obsequies

    mr vintin cried the engineer as he
hurriedly sprang into his cab and prepared
to take his engine to the roundhouse  this
road hasnt paid me any money in so long a
time that i havent a cent for my funeral
expenses therefore ill have to ask you to
postpone the obsequies and ill withdraw my
resignation 

   i had received a letter from a railroad man

living in burlington iowa in which i was
told that pop qrrison would be in st
louis at the terminal hotel in the union
station on good friday

  at five in the afternoon on the day men-
tioned i was there there was an immense
crowd in the depot it was as big as the one
that had greeted president taft upon his ar-
rival there a few months before-perhaps ten
thousand strong

  suddenly the throng broke into wild tu-
multuous shouts as a remarkably pretty young
woman appeared at the gate marked track
eight on which a pennsylvania railroad
train had jiist arrived

  the crowd surged toward her like a wave
and for a moment it looked as if the young
woman would be drowned in the human sea
policemen and station-men plunged to the
rescue of miss florence lawrence moving-
picture actress who had been photographed
five million times and was known as  the
girl of a thousand faces

  as an opening was made for her i saw a
man with white hair and beard

  hastening to him i said

   isnt this mr orrison  

   sure thing son im called  pop  or-
rison

  son he said presently im some busy
with a veteran association till sunday after-
noon ill be free then and im goin to
walk across that big eads bridge for the
first time in my life will you join me

  i said i would-and thats how i came to
be on the eads bridge with the ex-engineer
of io-way

  on that occasion the old railroader related
the following

actor in spite of himself

   seein the moving-picture actress received
by that crowd o greeters the other day at the
union station reminds me of a racing ex-
perience of one of the fat men of our broth-
erhood-an engineer out of chicago called
 fatty  mcbride

   one awful hot day mcbride was taking
a sunday afternoon stroll in the windy city
suburbs as he approached a bridge across
the chicago river he suddenly saw a young
woman start over the bridge stealthily fol-
lowed by two men in the middle of the
bridge the men pounced upon the damsel and
lifted her up to the rail as if to throw her
into the river

  the girl struggled like a demon but she
didnt open her mouth to scroam nor any-
ten thousand miles by rail



thing of that sort by way of running up her
signal of distress

    all this happened quickern i can tell it
mcbride started for that bridge on the fast-
est run hed ever taken since he had expand-
ed in girth to a weight of two hundred and
twenty-three pounds

   just as he stepped on the bridge the girl
broke loose from the two men and flew away
at a marathon gait with the thugs pursuing
her

- by george exclaimed fatty mc-
bride  that damsel is in terrible distress
and its up to me to save her

    so he rushed to the rescue feelin thrills
runnin down his spine like they say heroes
do when about to perform a medal-winning
deed

    down to the railroad tracks flew the
damsel the thugs overtook her seized her
threw her down on a rail and proceeded to
lash her fast with the ends of a long black
sash that she wore around her waist hav-
ing tied the girl the two men ran away

   all this time fatty mcbride kept run-
ning and just as the thugs got the damsel
tied fast to the rail and just as a locomotive
was seen coming toward her down the track
fatty rushed up puffing like a mogul on a
grade

  as the locomotive came toward them
fatty knelt over the girl and began to untie
her what does the damsel do but begin
laughing so hard that tears stream down her
face

     youre sure a brave gal says fatty be-
tween his blowing and puffing  to laugh
like that in the very face of death but ill
save you gal dont worry

   just as he untied the last knot the girl
jumped up and off the track still shouting
with laughter the train rolled slowly by
with the engineer leaning out of his cab

youre a born

looking at fatty and laugh-
ing hearty

then fatty heard a man
yelling

  youre all right fat
actor bully for you 

    this is a moving-picture outfit when
we saw you fly to the rescue of the girl on the
bridge we decided it would be a good stunt to
let you go as far as you liked the original
plan was for the gi rl to untie herself from the
rail with her teeth but you got her to laughing
so hard fat she couldnt play her part and
so she let you set her free the engine was
to stop on the safe side of her of course
well im hanged exclaimed fat

had holes in it

  frank roden the commercial agent of the
chicago great western railroad was in st
louis one morning while making my daily
round of the station one of the boys said
frank roden showed up here a few days
ago and warned every railroad man under
these roofs to look out for a stuttering boy

   one morning frank roden received the
following letter

    dear sir as you are an old friend of
my father i venture to inform you that i
have lost my pocketbook and transportation
to chicago and to ask you kindly to tele-
graph this news to my father as i have no
money myself for the message my father
as you probably know is at present the sta-
tion-agent of the chicago great western at


the railroad mans magazine

  -

ill save you gal dont worry

dubuque iowa will you please ask him to
wire me the money for car fare and expenses
to chicago 

    good-hearted frank roden at once wired
his old friend at dubuque hardly had the
despatch gone forth than a young man en-
tered the commercial agents office and tip-
toed toward mr rodens desk his cap in his
hand and timidity written legibly in his
countenance

     well young man said roden  what
can i do for you dont look so scared
im only a human you looking for a job 
  im the au-au-au-au-author of that let-
let-letter asking you to tel-tel-tel-telegraph
my fa-fa-fa-father replied the young man

  that so shake hands glad to see
you glad to see any son or daughter or
any person whos related to my old friend

     i need fun-fun-fun-fun-funds stam-
mered the young man  will you ple-ple-
ple-please lend me a dol-dol-dol-dollar while
waiting f-f-f-for my fa-fa-fa-fa-father to an-
an-an-an-answer your tel-tel-telegram 
oh youre as dead broke as that 

    ye-ye-ye-yes sir im com-com-com-
completely bus-bus-bus-busted

     oh well since youre a son of my old
friend at dubuque im mighty glad to be
of service to you here  he peeled off an
ace from the stack and handed it to the young
man

     tha-tha-tha-thank you sir when shall
i ca-ca-ca-call for the mon-mon-money  

     the answer should be here in about two

hours my boy hell probably telegraph the
money you come back here about ten oclock
and i have no doubt but that youll then be
on easy street

  ten oclock came but the stuttering lad
failed to put in an appearance eleven
oclock tolled and still the stammerer came
not just then however came the answer-
ing wire from frank rodens friend in du-
buque reading  have no son never did
have and never expect to have

    slung  cried frank roden

  it was just after receiving that telegram
that frank roden hop-skipped-jumped among
the railroad men at the union station warn-
ing them against a stuttering boy

    so you were stung for a dollar were
you  asked the clerk at charlie gilpins
cigar-stand when roden told his story

  a dollar the commercial agent ex-
claimed  say you just multiply that by
two and then add some and youll come
nearer the real sum didnt i send a tele-
gram for him and didnt it cost me fifty-
five cents but even that isnt all what
gets most on my nerves is the fact that my
dear old friend our station-agent at du-
buque wired his answer collect that cost
me fifty-five cents more sum it up for your-
self and youll see that ive been stung for
exactly two dollars and one dime by a hu-
hu-hu-hu-human hornet with a brand of con-
con-con - con - conver - con - conver - conver-
conversation that had an aw-aw-aw-awful lot
of ho-ho-ho-hoho-hohoho-holes in it 
legs brown has a round-up

               by robert t creel

            it was a battle royal while it lasted but
            bully hacketts yellow streak ended the fight

          ow he came to be braking on
the c i w it would be im-
possible to say it is doubtful
if legs brown himself knew
he was a boomer brakeman
and as such he traveled by no
schedule whatever to ordinarily find him
at any given time you might inquire on any
railway division in america with an equal
chance of success

  he reminded you of that insect whose
amiable disposition and attenuated appear-
ance have won for it the sobriquet of  grand-
daddv-longlegs hence browns own nick-
name notwithstanding his fragile propor-
tions however when occasion arose he could
wield his huge fists with force sufficient to
fracture a jaw-bone or drive a mans ear
into the side of his head-a fact that had
been demonstrated to the sorrow of more than
one belligerent hobo

  as the long train of flat cars writhed in
and out among the sand-hills brown sta-
tioned a short distance ahead of the caboose
was the only person visible according to
his habit when unusually elated he stood
perfectly erect with hands clasped before
him and his soft hat pulled down over his
bullet-head in the manner of a hebrew
comedian

  at intervals he wailed forth the words of
a song to the effect that the life of a sailor is
fraught with hardship inasmuch as a certain
youth johnny by name had been drowned
in the deep blue sea many verses he sang
and each one varied from its predecessor only
in the name of the victim from which

symptoms it was plain diat something con-
ducive to his happiness had occurred or
might soon be expected to occur

  his joy in this instance was that of
anticipation and its source may be told in the
one word-trouble although he never vol-
untarily sought a conflict brown was not one
to leave the scene of a fight while there re-
mained a chance of participating therein

  at the last stop murphy the conductor
had received a telegram warning him to be
prepared for an attack when they entered
sandville a large number of hoboes were
gathered there and had taken possession of
the town explaining to the unhappy citizens
the necessity of majority-rule if the republi-
can form of government was to be maintained
in the land

  previous experience similar to this had
detracted from the novelty of the situation
for die few inhabitants of sandville but the
hoboes were becoming bolder and spoke of
capturing the next train that came thidier for
the purpose of making their escape where-
upon the station-agent had grown alarmed
and sent the telegram

  among his other characteristics brown
was intensely loyal to the road that chanced
to employ him any action such as that con-
templated by the hoboes was resented as a
personal affront furthermore at this par-
ticular time he knew that the president of the
road was but a few hours behind in his spe-
cial and brown deemed it his duty to do all
in his power to prevent any unpleasntness
when the great man should arrive

  therefore as they drew near the little



the railroad mans magazine

hamlet he returned to the caboose and con-
ferred with the conductor

    theys no use runnin clear in jim you
better stop on the edge of this here metropo-
lis while i go in an reconsider the force of
the enemy as they say in the array

    i wouldnt advise you to go alone legs
you cant tell what those boesll do if theyre
drunk

   why jim you know them fellersre like
sheep the only reason i can see for em act-
in like this is because they got a leader if
thats the case all igot to do is to sling him
around like he didnt cost much an thatll
take the fight right out of em besides if a
bunch of us go in theyll git ready for
trouble

  all right you can go while we stop for
water thatll give you time to see what
theyre up to

  so it was that on foot and unaccompanied
legs brown ambled into the captured town
he had no doubt as to the location of the
triumphant hoboes for though it was now
almost dark the only place that showed a
light was the saloon and to this he directed
his steps

  within a motley gathering of vagrants in
various attitudes of repose shouted their
orders to the bartender evidently bent on
making the most of their unwonted authority
supposing brown to be a farm laborer they
hailed him with delight anticipating an
evenings sport and sport there was albeit
of a character slightly different from what
they had expected

  at the bar stood a swarthy well-set fel-
low whose curly hair and high cheek-bones
together with the peculiar conformation of
his head marked him as a native of poland
this worthy was the most boisterous of the
lot but brown thought it hardly likely that
he was the leader giving him scant attention
therefore as he strode forward and ordered a
drink

   here ye rube ye better ask me fer what
ye want r ill break ye in two said the
tramp aggressively pausing in the act of
raising a glass to his lips

  brown reaching for his own drink seemed
not to hear the words but his prodigious
foot as if released from a spring suddenly-
swept up and striking the others hand
threw the glass with its contents into his
scowling face

  a storm of laughter arose from the on-
lookers who swore with mighty oaths that it
was the funniest thing they had ever seen
the victim however laughed not at all but

bellowed with rage and pain as the fiery
liquid seared his eyes and repeatedly yelled
for brown to come near that he might be
chewed up

   not desirous of being masticated nor yet
willing to move out of the way of the pole
who was blindly groping for him brown
chose the only alternative and smote him
squarely between the eyes so that he crum-
pled up on the floor then turning to the
mans comrades he broached the business of
the evening

    i want to tell you dirty bums that im
going to take charge of this here city govern-
ment from now till i leave if any of youve
got anything to say why you can step up and
say it you might be able to bluff these pore
devils that live here but ive seen too many
boes not to know what youre made of
youre all under arrest an the first man that
movesll git plugged the brakeman placed
a hand on his hip-pocket which by the way
held nothing but his red bandanna handker-
chief

   now i want to see the man thats at the
head of this outfit who put you up to this
job

  one of the men shrugged his shoulders
contemptuously you better wait till you
hear from bully hackett before you pinch
this gang guess thats him now

   following a sound of shuffling footsteps
the illustrious leader himself appeared in the
doorway bully hacketts visage was one of
those of which the worst dreams are made
while it was rendered somewhat vacant by
the absence of his nose one of his eyes and
the major portion of his upper lip-unwilling
sacrifices to the god of war-his expression
lost none of its ferocity on that account and
his shaggy hair and beard gave him a look
that was scarcely human

   mr hackett had been engaged on a private
foraging expedition and knew nothing of the
happenings within the saloon nor saw the
brakeman as he came toward the bar

   wots the matter he inquired savagely
didnt ye see that freight pull in

   by way of attracting his attention brown
struck him smartly on the part of his face
formerly occupied by his nose

    yes an shell lay there till she rots if
she waits fer you to take her out by the time
i git through with you youll be ready to
crawl in your hole said the brakeman he
had seen the train-crew gathered in the
shadows outside the door and now had little
to fear from the other hoboes

   possessed of keen perceptions as are all
legs brown has a round-up



great leaders hackett at once suspected that
the brakeman liad struck him intentionally
and his one eye gleamed redly

  yah-h-li he snarled too angry for
more intelligible speech

  better take off your coat because im not
a goin to knock you out ill make you quit
like a dog so the rest of these gentsll see what
you are stated brown removing his own
outer garment

  hackett waited not for further advice but
lashed out so viciously with his right arm
that brown was taken unawares and had it
not been for the bar at his back he would
have gone down ignominiously even so he
was in an evil plight for the tramp seeing
his opportunity rushed in raining blows on
the face and body of his opponent

  then indeed did it seem that the brake-
man had been overconfident in his boasting
the other hoboes shouted encouragement to
their champion and the train-crew were only
restrained from joining in the fight by the
conductor who continued to voice his belief
in browns prowess

  veteran of a hundred battles browns first
move was to stop the flailing arms this he
did by the simple expedient of twining his
own about them gradually with the appar-
ent sinuosity of a boa-constrictor he wrapped
his limbs about those of the other and for a
moment lifted his own feet clear of the floor
making hackett support the weight of both
their bodies then unmindful of his strug-
gles brown as carefully freed himself send-
ing the hobo backward with a solid jolt on
the spot where his first blow had landed

  brown was intent on proving a theory that
he had long held namely that a man though
inwardly a coward may fight with seeming
bravery so long as the blows of his adversary
have not the appearance of being well-judged
or aimed with accuracy but that a succession
of blows however light on a sensitive spot
will make him quit if he has the least vestige
of a yellow streak

  during the next few minutes so fiercely
did hackett assail him that the brakeman
was almost entirely on the defensive more
than once he felt the impact of the tramps
horny fist on his face but he still held to his
purpose when the opening offered his
hand flashed out striking with invariable
precision the spot he had selected for his
attack

  hackett manifested his displeasure at this
mode of warfare evidently thinking that
brown acted dishonorably in profiting by the
absence of his nasal feature at each of-

fense the tramp rushed in with the avowed
intention of  demolishing the whole of
browns material body and to avoid these
rushes the brakeman executed a series of
jumps that would have done credit to a grass-
hopper finding no obstruction in his
course hackett went on until his head struck
the wall which so diminished his speed that
he was enabled to make a short turn and
again face his opponent

  for a long time they fought neither gain-
ing the advantage brown was bleeding free-
ly from the mouth and one eye was fast
swelling shut but his antagonist was also
badly bruised the remnant of his nose being
quite raw of the two hackett seemed the
more fatigued excessive drinking had
made him short-winded and he breathed
heavily the brakeman now began to force
the fighting striking more often and with
greater force but ever in the same spot
hackett gave ground and once he glanced
back as if seeking a way of escape

  stand up an fight why dont you
panted brown  you claim to be the cham-
peen bo well i aint no kind of a cham-
peen an here youre tryin to quit before i
git warmed up what kind of fightin do
you call that come on an mix it a little

  but hackett had had enough his spirit
was gone and he slunk back into the crowd
whimpering

  stop im boys stop im he pleaded
 my heavens my mugs broke in i cant
fight no more

  you dont need to be scared im satis-
ed answered brown  i knew you was a
quitter the minute i seen you an i wanted
to show you up so you couldnt lead these
dubs into no more deviltry whatll we do
with em jim he asked turning to the
conductor

  the best thing will be to lock em in a
box car an hand em over to the sheriff at
rennington replied murphy who was
guarding the door

  from the dark recesses of the caboose he
had brought forth an old revolver with it
to uphold his authority the erstwhile con-
querors were placed in line and marched to
the waiting train escorted by the crew

  to brown this closed the incident he
marveled greatly therefore when there came
a commendatory letter from the companys
chief executive together with a small pack-
age which on examination was found to
contain a gold watch

  that business mustve leaked out some
way or other he remarked thoughtfully

  the vatican and the st petersburg winter pal-
ace are larger buildings but they have been cen-
turies in their construction the pennsylvania
station is unique covering as it does eight acres of
ground with exterior walls extending approximately
one half of a mile all told and having been erected
in less than six years time

  this station is not only the largest structure of
its kind in the world but it epitomizes and em-
bodies the highest development of the art of trans-
portation every practicable convenience the most
ingenious of mechanical and electrical inventions
every safeguard against danger-all in fact that
has so far been learned in railway transportation
and station perfection has been availed of for the
benefit of every passenger no matter whether he
is to take a short ride to long island or a two-
thousand-mile trip to the west

  while the cost of the improvement represents a
greater expenditure than was ever before incurred
by a private corporation for a single undertaking
nevertheless it was required to unite the principal
parts of the thickly populated area in and around
new yorfcycity and to provide unsurpassed facili-
ties in the very heart of the city for reaching the
entire country

increase in ten years of  per cent in  it is
estimated that the population of this territory will
approximate six million people and in  eight
million	

  these startling figures and what they meant in
transportation needs in addition to the serious
problem of providing corresponding freight facili-

road was contemplating entering new york city

chapter vi

through the canon

art goldie remained in san
francisco long enough to have
hatched out a whole incubator
full of railroads he had been
absent from the adobe hotel for
almost three weeks when short
thomas who was anxious to go down to
phoenix and help run the government had
to lay off from the west local to mend a sec-
tion of his political fence which had been
rudely knocked down by some of the mor-
mons over near snowflake and they called
me to take out the pedlers

  if shorty thomas had had as much of a
cinch running for office as he did running
that west-end local he would have been
president of the united states by now

  short was about the only fellow who
could run the local and get over the road
without losing his rights he was so small
he could slip in where another fellow
couldnt put his feet

  he had a way of jumping across the divi-
sion ahead of a passenger running as sec-
ond section to the limited and several other
little things which while they were not ac-
cording to the standard book of rules got
him over the road in a space of time that
made a big hit with the old man and made
some of the rest of us who claimed to be
speedy look like a train-load of funerals

  on that local a fellow had to do every-
thing from rebuilding a box car to digging
rock out of the sunshine quarry

  there were half a dozen water-cars to be
filled at angell coal to be put on the chute
at winona three cars of steel to unload near
cliffs a quarter of beef for  pap  volz at
canon diablo five cents worth of pepper

and a can of corn for the female mayor at
moqui the blind-siding report to be made
out and the switching at the lumber-mills

  when i got to the other end of the divi-
sion i tied up for six hours rest and when
i got back to winslow there were gray hairs
in my head and bennett was in the hos-
pital suffering from old age

  they said it was typhoid-fever but i
couldnt make myself believe it the fact
is i always had my doubts about his being
sick at all for every time i went over that
way i found him sitting up in bed talking
a blue streak to miss fowler

  at any rate when i returned from the
trip on the local bart had returned from
san francisco i found him packing his
belongings when i entered the adobe and i
felt sure that it was all off he had re-
ceived his walking-papers or had asked for
his time

  now whats up i asked as soon as i
realized that he was packing his trunk

  im going to the mountains for my
health he replied

  quit or get canned

  neither he answered

  he seemed as willing to talk as a man
with the lockjaw as i had been twenty-
two hours on the road i didnt feel like
coaxing him very much

  well you might tell a fellow whats in
the air i remarked rather peevishly

  nothing particularly the management
of the road has decided that it must have
that mail contract at any cost and im going
to fix it so they can get it

    but its too late now i volunteered

  the present contract is only for a year
sort of a probation affair it will be open
to competition again next year and by that
time-

on short time



  bart found difficulty in getting the lid
down on the trunk and forgot to finish

  by that time what i asked

   by that time we will have rebuilt enough
of the road to make it possible to make better
time from albuquerque west than any other
road

   so you convinced mr ellington waller-
heit smartley advisory engineer of san
francisco u s a that he didnt know
much about track-building did you  

  now im a perfect lady and i refuse to
repeat what bart said about mr smartley

  after touching briefly but firmly on mr
smartleys personal appearance and his
lack of brain-matter bart inadvertently re-
marked 

   i suppose its a fight to the finish be-
tween he and i old man martin probably
figures that he will have to take care of him
some day anyhow so he keeps him on the
pay-roll martin had better watch out or
he will rob him of something else besides
his daughter

  then bart rather regretted his words and
went to kicking the varnish off the trunk-
lid until he finally forced it down in place
and locked it

   but where are you going now   i asked

  over to the forks i am going to meet
mr martin there to-morrow he is bring-
ing several experts out from san francisco
and we are going over the route along john-
sons canon

   if they are convinced that i know what
im talking about when i say we can cut off
fifty-three miles by building the road along
the left side of the canon ill make my head-
quarters at supai and start to work at once

  of course i didnt say much to bart
about the proposition i needed sleep and
the few remarks which bart made about
smartley convinced me that while bart may
have convinced every one that smartley
didnt know much about railroad building
he had not been able to stop the san fran-
cisco mans campaign for lois martins
hand

  i knew that if it came to a choice between
winning lois martin and building a piece
of railroad among the eagles nests that bart
would have taken the girl

  bart wasnt blue i could hardly call it
that he was a bilious black i sure would
like to know what really happened in san
francisco while he was in there

  did he ask the girl to marry him and get
an order to run on light did he see
smartley breaking into the family

  it must have been something pretty strong
for when he came back he wasnt the same
bart exactly and the feeling which had
taken possession of me the first time i met
him returned

  he would say no or yes and it
would sting more than all the abusive lan-
guage a drunken sailor could hand out in an
hours time every one under him found
him a slave-driver i dont know just what
it was but it seemed to me that he had
locked every one out of his life

  he had determined to build that fool piece
of track down johnsons canon and he was
going to build it he became reckless in his
work not that he neglected a single detail in
a job but when there was a chance of any
one being hurt in doing some of the work
bart was always right at the side of the man
in danger whether it was an indian laborer
or a white man

  he went over to the forks and i would
only see him once in a while when he hap-
pened to be about the station when i went
through or when he would climb onto my
train and ride over to supai i couldnt get
much of an idea of what was going on

  the agent over at the forks told me that
the general manager the superintendent and
two other fellows had left the forks one day
with bart they had been gone two days
before they returned

  he didnt know what the deal was but he
said he heard the general manager tell old
man arnold the morning the former re-
turned to san francisco that mr golds-
worthy knows what lie is doing and we will
just put him in charge of this work and get
another roadmaster

  about one week after that i saw a bulletin
on the board down at the despatchers office
which said that erick andersen had been
appointed acting roadmaster vice  bartholo-
mew e goldsworthy assigned to other du-
ties

  i began to wonder if every one along the
pike had gone crazy to think that sane
men of business would allow bart to con-
vince them that he could build a railroad
down johnsons canon

  it got to be a joke on our road and it was
such a good joke that it spread to other
roads i understand several experts from
the s s and t went over and took a look
at johnsons canon and went home to
laugh the rest of the year

  i understand that old man arnold said it
couldnt be done general manager martin
said he hoped it could smartley said it was


the railroad mans magazine

the evidence of an unbalanced mind and
bart was the only man on the whole road
who said it could be done and be done
within a year

  i dont know how he convinced them but
he did and when i pulled three cars of
hydraulic drills and other machinery out of
winslow one night billed to supai and
caught a car of blasting powder in the same
train i couldnt help but recall the fact that
bart goldie had sai i  we will build that
piece of road some day

  i had to admit that the hon charles
flynn was pretty near correct when he re-
marked diat  it haint safe to say nothing
cant be done any more for nine times out
of ten a fellow dont get the words out of his
mouth until some fellow comes along and
makes him out a liar by doing it

  reports kept coming down from supai
mountain regarding the work and some of
them concerned bart directly it was said
that they had let bart down over the preci-
pice of the canon on a rope to start out with
and that he had worked a half-day there
hanging between heaven and earth trying to
dig a hole in that ledge of rock with a cold-
chisel and a hammer

  in another week i heard that he really
had dug the hole and it was now so big that
several men could stand in it then i heard
that a mexican had slipped from that shelf
of rock and that when he hit the bottom of
the canon there wasnt enough left of him to
bury

  all the time however more machinery
went by billed to supai and there was
enough blasting powder set out there to
have blown the rocky mountain range into
the sea

  i heard it said that goldsworthy never
went to sleep that he was on the job all the
time as cross as a bear with a sore ear that
he would fire men for the most trivial viola-
tion of orders-and i heard enough other
r-tutf to make me sit up nights trying to solve
the puzzle of one bart goldie

  then i had other troubles too that
grinning face of bennetts kept hanging
round the hospital he stayed there for six
weeks and never showed a sign of leaving
he got to the point where he could wabble
about the veranda and a couple of times i
caught him talking to miss fowler i just
made up my mind to tell miss fowler what
a good-for-nothing mean-dispositioned fel-
low he was

  i went over there one evening and found
them sitting out in the moonlight that

showed that bennett wasnt sick for moon-
light is dangerous to a sick man i walked
right up to them and with all the dignity i
could command i began

  miss fowler i have an important matter
of business to talk over with you

  i said it that way because i wanted ben-
nett to know that miss fowler and i were
associated in certain affairs

  indeed how unusual she says then
she turned to that grinning freckled-faced
fake and asked  would you excuse me for
a few minutes  

  the idea of miss fowler having to ask
him to excuse her

  we walked around to the other side of the
hospital and i got out a search-warrant for
something which resembled  an important
matter to talk about

    is bennett running this hospital or just
living here was the best i could do

    what a foolish question she replied

   well lies been hanging around here for
almost two months now-

   he has been a very sick man she in-
terrupted  there was a time when i was
afraid he wasnt going to get well

   you seem to worry a good deal about
him now that hospital is no place for you
and-er-that is you-see- i didnt
know just what to say next so i shut up

  yes i see she volunteered its a
beautiful night isnt it

  not knowing just what to say i admitted
that it was

   but the important business mr mur-
ray

  oh yes i had almost forgotten about
that i answered just to let her know that
i wasnt tongue-tied

   im going to be called about midnight
and i understand that im going to be cut
out at supai for a work-train on the cut-off
i may be out there for several weeks and
before i go i just want to tell you that i-
er-that is i dont like this work-train job
it is-

  why dont you tell the trainmaster
im going to miss fowler thats just
what i am going to do im going over and
quit the road and leave the country

   oh youre not going to do that mr
murray it wouldnt seem like home with-
out you here

  honest i said feeling like an aero-
plane just two minutes before it leaves the
ground

   yes indeed i should miss you a great
deal
on short time



  all right i wont go

  oh thats a dear she exclaimed and
just then the aeroplane left the earth and
went skipping from cloud to cloud i was
so busy holding on that i cant recall much
of the conversation from that time on but
there were several remarks regarding dou-
ble-heading for life and i asked her to be
one of the engines

  then i felt a sinking sensation the fly-
ing-machine started down and its a wonder
i wasnt killed by the fall

  when  left the hospital that eveningr i
swore that just so soon as bennett got well
enough i was going to call him out id
fight him with guns or brickbats at half a
block and ask no quarter

  i think i knew just how bart felt when
he came back from san francisco after hav-
ing seen that fellow smartley forcing him-
self on a poor unsuspecting woman

  i wanted to be alone i didnt have much
conversation for any one i went out and
did my own switching and let the brake-
men sit around and swap stories i rode
the pilot-beam between stations hoping that
we would hit something and when they cut
me out at supai and put me on the work-
train at barts new cut-off i was glad of it

  there was danger there i wanted to
hang around it flirt with it and i didnt
care if some one went right back to winslow
and told miss fowler what she had caused
me to do

  if i could have been present to see her
look down on my mangled form and faint
with remorse i would have been willing to
have been shoved off the shelf of rock where
the men were working

  as i couldnt have the satisfaction of
standing with her by my corpse telling her
that i had been a victim of her heartless-
ness i decided to keep just as far away from
the edge of that precipice as i could and live
long enough to even the score with bennett

  when i got down the mile of new track
from supai to johnsons canon i saw a
sight that made me forget the sorrows of my
miserable life

  i saw men hanging to the face of that
canon by their eyebrows drilling into the
rock i saw a shelf cut out of the ledge
wide enough for two tracks if necessary
and a half-mile long i saw reenforced
concrete abutments built at either side of the
canon all ready for the steel for a bridge
which would carry the track over to that
shelf of rock

  while that wasnt more than half that i

saw it was enough to show me that build-
ing a railroad down johnsons canon was a
joke but the funny end of the joke wasnt
pointed toward bart goldie who by the
way was swinging out over a three-hun-
dred-foot hole in the ground riding the first
steel girder to its place on the abutment on
the far side of the big crack

  it made me dizzy to look at him i
couldnt help but think what would happen
if that thread of cable which held over a
thousand pounds of weight should break
it made me feel like putting my tail be-
tween my legs and crawling away back un-
der the barn

  i never worked so hard in my life as i
did on that one mile line the crew helped
a little in the unloading at the canon i
lived in mortal fear that a percussion-cap or
a few sticks of dynamite would blow us all
over into the next county but these little
things kept my mind off bart during the
day and in their way were a blessing

  bart and i were together every evening
again it was a case of misery loving com-
pany i guess for we got along fine he
never mentioning his troubles and i never
intimating how my young life had been
blighted by a fickle woman

  i dont know that it was the similarity of
our hidden grief but for some reason or
other i began to really understand bart
goldie it is a fact that he was a slave-
driver and all that but he had to be

  i heard him state his case to superintend-
ent arnold one day when arnold came
down to look over the job and ordered a
mexican to knock out a prop which seemed
to be in the way of one of the little tram-
cars operated on the shelf of rock

  the mexican started to obey and bart
fired him on the spot arnold explained
that he had ordered it and bart told ar-
nold the following very plain story

  mr arnold im in charge of this work
if i fail my reputation is ruined-that to
me is a great deal if i fai your company
will have wasted over ten millions of dol-
lars-that should be a great deal to you
no man gives orders on this job but me
its a case where it must be so for the pro-
tection of the men one false move like
that might cost a dozen lives all the men
have their orders this mexican had his
and there is no excuse for his having violated
them if you want to give him work on a
section some place thats your affair

  the old man chewed that over for a few
minutes and swallowed hard


the railroad mans magazine

  youre right goldsworthy your right
he said and from diat day on if there was
an order to be made bart made it

  any one could make suggestions to bart
but no one could order a man to do so much
as pick up a shovel superintendents train-
masters master-mechanics and even gen-
eral manager martin looked like common
folk to bart and every one of them was
willing to have it that way except elling-
ton wallerheit smartley i have an idea
that martin kept smartley locked up in his
san francisco office until the work was so
far advanced that he could cause no conse-
quential delay

  rome wasnt built in a day nor did bart
build his railroad down johnsons canon in
a month fortunately for the a and p
the trial for the mail contract was delayed
for some cause or other and it was eighteen
months before the a and p received notice
that the government was ready to have them
show what could be done the management
of the road conferred with bart to find out
when the cut-off would be completed and
he said four months more if he had plenty
of men and good luck the road furnished
the men and providence the luck and even-
one did hi part except smartley

  after bart had the work well under way
on the east end of the canon he started an-
other gang in at the west and they worked
toward the center where he had planned to
tunnel for a half-mile

  the work had been going on for almost a
year the tunnel had been started from the
east side the big steel bridge across the
canon at the east had been put in and when
bart received notice that the speed trial for
the mail contract would be made in four
months his men had several hundred yards
of the tunnel completed

  with the cut-off the situation was this
the main line from supai had wandered
away to the south and wound about the
bluffs and canons working west at every op-
portunity to the forks it followed just
such a course as a stream might follow-
the line of least resistance

  the cut-off left the old main line at su-
pai and went directly west for a mile to
where it encountered johnsons canon which
came down from the north and turned sharp-
ly to the west for four miles then it went
south for a mile and doubled back to the
north leaving a spear-head of rock between
the southern and northern course which was
about one-half mile wide at the base

  fortunately the canon resumed its way to

the west in a direct line with its course be-
fore it ran off to the south five miles be-
yond the left side of the canon fell away so
that the right-of-way came out on the sur-
face again and continued due west into die
forks

  by the cut-off the distance was just
twelve and a half miles from supai to the
forks where before it had been sixty-five

  the rails had been put in from ash fork
as fast as the road-bed was cut out the
same was done from supai and with two
months more to go on bart finally had both
gangs working on the tunnel

  i was the first conductor to run over the
new track and denny reagan with his
half-moon grin was the first engineer to
open a throttle on the big shelf it looked
as if we were going to beat barts time by
thirty days until smartley appeared on the
scene

  it was an evening late in august the
mexican and indian laborers had just cut
off work and were piling onto the work-
train to ride back to supai to dieir bunk-
houses and beans

  bart and i were standing near die en-
gine talking when i looked up the track
about two hundred yards away was the
bunch of clothes and a walking-stick close
in against the face of the precipice coming
toward us

   a friend of yours i believe i said to
bart

  he looked up when his eyes fell on
smartley they narrowed to mere slits the
muscles over his jaws came up in lumps
and that undershot jaw of his set with a
click like a bolt slipping into place in a
burglar-proof vault

  i just had time enough to bet myself a
box of clear havanas against an omelet pie
that there was going to be trouble when the
big noise from san francisco came up jug-
gling that one eye-glass of his he said

  ah mr goldsworthy ive been looking
for you for several hours yknow deucedly
dangerous piece of track this i should
think you would let your sub-foremen look
after the details yknow

chapter vii
in my little crib again

dy consulting the hieroglyphics in my
 train-book i find that on august 
i had in twenty-five days on the work-train
and sixty-two hours overtime which i
on short time



think goes to show that if miss fowler
thought i was going to mope around griev-
ing over the way she shoved me onto a blind
siding she didnt fully understand the na-
ture of the brute

  if she had known that i was just hoping
that she would marry bennett-but then it
wouldnt be quite right to say that so i
wont

  but getting back to the main line my
train-book shows that it was august  when
smartley made his appearance on the scene
of action but thirty days remained until
the speed trails for the transcontinental mail
would start from chicago

  a blind man could see that it was going
to be a close shave and although bart in-
sisted that the mail-train would run over the
cut-off there were many who expressed more
than a doubt about it

  one night i dreamed that i had just fall-
en off the ledge i had a great trip going
down bouncing from pebble to pebble and
finally landing in a sitting posture on a bed
of cacti the tickling sensation on alight-
ing woke me and i found bart sitting at the
old drv-goods box studying a blue-print

  i looked at my watch which was under
the pillow and it was three oclock i dont
know if bart was up again or yet regard-
less of the sleep question bart told me that
he would be in the clear for the big mail
special barring accidents-but he didnt fig-
ure on smartley

 general manager martin must have
grown a little nervous for on august  his
car was set out at supai and when bart
and i got in that night bringing smartley
in with us there was a conference in the
private car

  when bart returned to the bunk-house lie
told me that martin was going to remain
right at supai until the work was finished
he didnt tell me that the entire martin
family was in the car but i found that out
the next day when i saw smartley piloting
miss martin over the new piece of track
down to where the work was going on at the
tunnel

  i couldnt help but notice that the walk-
ing-stick and the eye-glass was on the inside
next the precipice with miss martin on the
side nearest the edge of the canon and i
couldnt help but think that that would be
about the same way that freckled-faced ben-
nett would protect a lady in a dangerous
place

  of course i had more to do than stand
around and watch smartley as he showed
 rr

miss martin what a wonderful piece of
track he was building bart was putting
heavy steel arches in the tunnel just as rap-
idly as possible when the couple arrived
on the scene i was just starting back to
supai with the work-train to bring down a
load of this steel

  i dont believe i was gone more than an
hour but i got back just in time to see
enougli of the show to lead me to believe
that it would have been worth the money to
have seen it all

  bart was coming out of the mouth of the
tunnel he had fido by the collar fidos
one glass eye was out of place and his silk
stack was running off toward jones he
was sure walking turkey about twenty
feet from the tunnel bart let him go i
didnt need an ear-trumpet to hear what he
told him although i was a good three car-
lengths to the windward

  now mr smartley bart remarked in
a voice as soft as the rough side of a coarse
file  if you have any further doubts as to
who is running this job you might take the
matter up direct with mr martin i have
no time to argue the question if you fol-
low the track it will take you to supai and
if you come below the trestle again without
a guardian ill not be responsible for what
happens to you

  smartley took off up the track like a yel-
low cur with a tin-can running mate on a
fast schedule for the dark spots under the
back porch

  miss martin had followed the two men
from the tunnel and i rather thought she
enjoyed the show as much as i did bart
was mightily embarrassed though he
turned to her and raised that greasy lid of
his from his head as i had made it a
point to get a little closer to the scene of acr
tion i heard him say

  miss martin i cant tell you how i re-
gret this little episode you will not under-
stand i am afraid because you are not fa-
miliar with the class of men i have to deal
with i have to rule here

  no apology is necessary mr golds-
worthy replied the young lady in a way
that was noncommittal

  you couldnt tell whether she was angry or
pleased

   indeed an apology is necessary but it
would take a great deal more time tj- ex-
plain than i can take right now if you
would permit it i should be glad to make
my apologies this evening after i get back
to the camp in the meantime i must in-


the railroad mans magazine

sist that this is entirely too dangerous a
place for you

    and you  

  aeroplanes and balloons again it made
me think of the time that miss-but then
that was all past so whats the use to bring
it up again

   oh its part of my work miss martin
and with that bart dismissed the subject
he called me over and it was then that i
was formally introduced to miss martin
after die introduction bart continued

   mr murray i want you to help miss
martin onto the engine and see her safely
back to supai

   but i want to see what you are doing
in that tunnel mr goldsworthy really
i do

   im sorry that it is impossible he
replied

   please take me in it would be safe if
you were with me

   if a woman like miss martin talked
that way to me i wotdd give her anything
she wanted why when miss fowler asked
me-but whats the use

  bart wouldnt stand for it the best miss
martin got was his promise to take her over
the entire piece of track just so soon as he
considered it entirely safe with that he
walked over to the engine with us helped
the lady up into the cab and for once den-
ny reagan started off like a gentleman

  i was much obliged to denny for run-
ning so slow it save me a chance to talk

o	o

to the general managers daughter i wish
miss fowler could have seen us two setting
up there on the firemans seat

  miss martin asked me why bart would
not allow any one in the tunnel except the
workmen and i felt called upon to paint
for her a graphic picture of cave-ins pre-
mature explosions and a few other little
things which hadnt happened up to date
i also dwelt on the number of victims who
had been sacrificed in the building of the
road i let her know that mr bartholomew

e	goldsworthy was the man who conceived
the idea of building the cut-off that he was
the man who had built it and that in more
ways than one hewas a greater man than he
looked

  by the time we got up to supai miss mar-
tin wasnt talking very much and there was
that day-after-to-morrow look in her eyes
she wasnt seeing much of the landscape

  she didnt see smartley when we most
frightened the life out of him as we passed
him he edged up against the rocks so tight

that i wouldnt be surprised if you could
find his imprint there yet

  a week went by and smartley did not
appear in the vicinity of the tunnel bart
saw him every evening at the conferences in
the private car which had become a daily
occurrence and one morning when i was
loading a flat with steel beams i saw smart-
ley miss martin and her mother starting
out for a little stroll up the mountain that
night the private car went over to williams
and it was almost a week before it was
brought back and set in on the spur again
when it did return general manager mar-
tin sent a messenger for bart after the
conference an extra gang of laborers were
ordered down to the tunnel from the section
just above supai

  we were on short time sure enough
everybody was predicting that the tunnel
would not be through within a month of
course i listened to all the straight tips i
heard and then i went to bart with them
and asked him to give me his best guess
on it

  bart got out a blue-print by standing
on my head and looking cross-eyed i was
almost able to make out what it represented
however bart knew just what it was and
he demonstrated to me that there was only
one more weeks work for a few able-bodied
men and the tunnel would be in shape so
that it could be used

  there would be a few little things to be
done after that-putting on the final coat of
varnish hanging the mottoes at the en-
trances and the like but when bart got
through explaining although i didnt quite
understand some of the figures carried out
to the sixth decimal place plus  x  over
y i just went out and added up how
much i had bet on the game so far and
doubled it

  i was betting a hundred dollars to a bean
i couldnt help but feel sorry for the mexi-
can inhabitants for if i won and demand-
ed quick payment i would have had the
bean crop of the united states and mexico
sewed up in a sack and a call on th fu-
tures for five years to come then the bears
got busy and i came near going broke

  when they brought that extra gang down
from supai andpitt them on the job bart
made a mistakei there was one fellow who
had a large scar on his head bart should
never have allowed him on the premises it
was the same gentleman with whom bart was
having the little argument that evening at
the cinder pit when i first met the new
on short time



roadmaster if bart had forgotten him the
mexican had a better memory

  i suppose the court would rule that my
testimony being based on hearsay should
not be put on record but my source of in-
formation was the mexican saved  from
drowning in cosnino creek by bart goldie
and though what i say now might not in-
fluence the court what he told me direct
certainly made a strong case in my mind

  when bart and i went to work that fri-
day morning bart was in great spirits

    ill show you an imitation of a real days
work he remarked just as if getting up in
the morning so early that he met himself go-
ing to bed the night before wasnt enough
evidence that he was doing a real job of
work

  when he got down to the tunnel he made
things fly it was about ten oclock bart
was in the tunnel the extra gang was
doing some minor work at the east entrance
of the long hole and as we had all the steel
-even the rails which were to go into the
tunnel as fast as it was cleaned out-down
to the spot i had little to do

   i had never watched the operations at the
head of the excavating and i wandered down
into-it until i found bart i thought i
would get a few dollars worth of sight-
seeing provided bart didnt take me by the
collar and march me out as he had smartley

   i must have been in- there about an hour
when we heard a yell it wasnt much of a
yell at that sounded as if some one had
stepped on a setter pups tail with the
tunnel walls to hold the sound in the effect
wasnt just exactly pleasant

   bart and i were down at the head of the
drive more than a quarter of a mile from
the east entrance we both heard the yell
and bart started to go back and investigate
then came another yell it sounded to me
like some one calling goldsworthy

   the floor of the tunnel came up and hit
me in the face i felt an awful pain in my
ears and being badly in need of rest i went
off to sleep

  i dont know how long i slept there on
that rock floor-quite a while i guess for
when i came to bart was kneeling over me
a torch was burning near on the tunnel floor
and if the yell i had heard before i went to
sleep was creepy the chorus of vocal noises
that greeted me when i came to would have
been a credit to a train-load of snakes

     how do you feel   asked bart

  all right i replied whats hap-
pened  

   cave-in about a hundred yards inside
the mouth of the tunnel can you walk 

  walk well say show me the way out
and you wont be able to catch me with a
race-horse

  bart helped me to my feet and as he
stooped over to pick up the torch he re-
marked 

   thats where the rub comes in there
is no way out until we dig one

  there was bart there i was there was a
dozen mexicans and jimmy dugan and his
boys who had been working the drills and-
there we all were

  to the west the tunnel ended in a solid
wall of native stone which according to
barts figures could hardly be tunneled
through by the men working from the west
inside of four days and back toward the en-
trance we were blocked by the cave-in-
tons and tons of -rock just how much i
wouldnt venture a guess

  we took the torches and went back to the
cave-in bart inspected it as if he was look-
ing for a diamond and i sat down on a gen-
erous chunk of stone and hoped that some
one would tell miss fowler that she had
driven me to this miserable fate

  the mexicans put in their time in a mara-
thon race from the cave-in down to the head
of the drive and back and then over the
same route again

  it would have been a great race if half of
them hadnt collided with the other half in
making the turn as it was i cant imagine
anything that would produce the same effect
up and down a mans spine as did their
wailing and yelling unless it is a curry-
comb

  bart endeavored to quiet them but one
of them refused to be quieted bart grabbed-
one of-them by the collar and shook him
and then pushed him aside he stumbled
over a stone and sank down in the tuihnel
to lie there sniveling and talking mexican
to a certain saint i tried to repeat it after
him but before i had it learned bart called
to me and i had to join the boys at the
cave-in

   baldy began bart in the same reliable
tone of voice  guess we will have to dig our
way through this they will be working
from the other side and what we do from
this end will just help that much

  yes bart i replied but what can
we do 

  tull these rocks back break up the
big ones dig out come dugan lets get
the sledges and the shovels 


the railroad mans magazine

  he and dugan started back to the head
of the tunnel and i went along because i
didnt care to be left alone with that mexi-
can who was still moaning

  we got the sledges and the shovels and
started to work it was slow and nerve-
racking bart didnt have much to say
dugan said less and i couldnt have made a
vocal noise if  had to we just worked

  finally a few of the mexicans grew calm
enough to join us and after we had been
working a couple of weeks you could almost
tell where we had been digging in about a
month we had made a little headway i be-
gan to feel quite cheerful for it looked as if
it would only be a few months more until
we should clear a way out

  of course i am used to eating once or
twice a week whether im hungry or not
and after we had been in there for some time
i began to feel mighty weak

  i guess we had been in there a year-leap
year at that-when i saw the grinning
freckled green-eyed face of bennett looking
at me from behind a rock which wasnt
there when i hit at it with my sledge-hammer

  just the same when i hit at the rock
bennett ran and i threw the hammer at him
then i sat down and began to wonder who
would take care of miss fowler the
torches began to dance about the blaze
seemed dying down i wondered what had
become of the mexican and his saint and
then bart goldie took me by the shoulder
shook me until my bones rattled and held
the torch down so close to my face that i
almost took a bite out of the flame

  bart looked awful big right then i
couldnt see up as far as his head and his
voice sounded as if it was coming from the
top of bill williams mountain and i was
down a well at the bottom

   baldy baldy  he began and about
seven hundred devils in the dark tunnel be-
gan to bark baldy baldy at me

   brace up baldy i can hear them pound-
ing on the rock 

   thats just bennett knocking me down
at the hospital i replied

  bart went away and left me to think of
the iig supper miss fowler and i had that
evening at the harvey house once i looked
up and there was bart still swinging that
sledge his torch was sitting up on a boulder
at his side dugan had gone i suppose he
ran off with bennett

  finally i remembered i wanted to tell
bart about the pay-checks which were de-
posited in the winslow bank of course

they wouldnt be of any use to me and as
miss fowler was born in kansas and i
passed through that state once she was
about tiie closest kin i had i wanted bart
to see that she got them but i didnt want
her to spend them on bennett i staggered
over to where he was and i made him stop
work long enough to hear my story

   bart goldie i began  ive got a few
thousand dollars down in the winslow bank
and i must have about seven billion dollars
bet that you will finish this tunnel in time
for the mail special when i win that mon-
ey you just collect it and- and then i quit

  rather i was brought to a full stop i
didnt know that i had been punctuated with
a period for about twelve hours later i woke
up to find myself in the little crib with the
fussy covers looking straight into the eyes
of miss fowler i knew that i was still
playing groundhog after having seen my
shadow i was wondering if i would hit a
cloudy day the next time i heard her voice
mr murray are you awake

  you know i didnt dare tell her i was
because i wasnt sure

  i dont know am i i said

  then i heard her laugh and i opened my
eyes again and durn me i was awake
right back there in that good old hospital
with miss fowler waiting on me again
then i began to remember things

  wheres bart goldie i almost shouted
   he is over at supai tunnel

  and where is dugan

  he is over at the tunnel too

  both of them all right i asked won-
dering how such a thing could be possible

   both of them all right she replied
and whats the matter with me
you replied miss fowler the pret-
tiest red i ever saw came creeping into her
face the merriest twinkle i ever want to see
came into her eyes and the sweetest smile
i ever expect to see came onto her lips  you
mr murray have been affected with a
chronic case of talking in your sleep

  just then the aeroplane started up again
its gentle motion made me dizzy and i went
back to sleep

chapter viii
wedding-bells

there are people who just stand around
waiting for a chance to join the anvil
chorus or sing the  i-told-you-so  solo
on short time



  these people never do anything worth men-
  tioning except criticize afellow who tries to
  do something worth while when the news
  of the cave-in spread over the division there
  were those who were ready to tell you that
  bart goldie was an imbecile that he didnt
  know the first principles of tunnel-building
  that any one with so much as a cinder of
  brains should have known that the top of
  that tunnel would fall in

   to a man up a tree-or more properly
 speaking to a man in a little white crib-
 there were certain things about the accident
 that had a smoky color to them

    i cant remember bart saying anything
 about there being a possibility of a cave-in
 he told me that the only thing he wanted
 to be careful about was premature explosion
 of the dynamite used in blasting while i
 didnt have a chance to look over the ground 
 until after the tunnel had been completed i
 had a source of information which placed
 me in possession of a few facts while they
 were never made public they finally reached
 the right party and put an entirely different
 face on the whole affair

   that mexican whom bart pulled out of
 cosnino creek a short time after he was
 made roadmaster proved to have been the
 owner of that warning screech which bart
  and i had heard just before the cave-in it
 seems that while i was sitting there in the
 tunnel trying to make an inventory of my
 good deeds so that i might have them in-
 dexed for ready reference should i be called
 upon to show my credentials bart had taken
 a body from beneath the rock which had
 fallen in

   tht body and myself found ourselves
 occupying the same ward in the hospital
 and while i according to miss fowler had
 only been troubled with a tendency to talk
 in my sleep the mexican was really in bad
 shape

    his head was battered in one arm was
 broken a few of his slats were cracked and
 he was almost beyond the need of the rip-
 track but miss fowlers nursing assisted
 by the doctors pills brought him far enough
 back to life to enable him to talk before
 i came out of the hospital i had a story
 that made me sit up and take a little notice

    the mexicans name wasjuan something
 or other he told me that he had been carry-
 ing powder from the little powder-house to
 the tunnel for over a month on the day
 of the accident he had passed smartley talk-
 ing to romero garcia who will be remem-
 bered as the man with whom bart once had

quite a tobasco-sauce argument over at the
cinder pit

  about two hours later juan bean-eater
or chili-chaser saw garcia lighting a fuse
which ran up the side of the tunnel about a
hundred yards from the entrance when
juan saw this his intellect which had never
shown signs of working faster than a slow
walk became wildly active and it was his
noise factory working at full capacity which
had disturbed the dark quietude down to-
ward the head of the tunnel where bgrt and
i were talking when the explosion came

  it seems that juan after going into the
tunnel about a hundred yards beyond where
he saw garcia light the fuse decided that he
would be unable to reach the men in time to
warn them and get back to the sunlight and
he turned back

  he told me that he made just as fast time
going out as he did coming in but he didnt
get by the charge of blasting powder when
the big works came off some of the scatter-
ing rock caught up with him and he came
within an ace of being transformed into an
imported porous plaster

   this little piece of gossip interested me
but there was another trifling item of news
for which i yearned

  a friend loaned me a novel once entitled
mabels other husband or who drew a
lemon i started to read it by the light
of my lantern one night when i had a drag
of black marbles over the third division i
got so interested in that classic that i forgot
to put up coal at winona and failed to pick
up my water-car at angell when the hog-
head began to yell i sent the brakeman over
the tops to find out what silly question was
on his mind

  when the rear shack came back and said
we would have to run for water i was just
at the place where mabels other husband
had arrived in south dakota and was about
ready to prove his final decree and i wasnt
going to delay the game so i just sent word
over for the eagle eye to run for water just
as far as he liked

  by the time the engine came back to the
train and the rear brakeman had been called
in with the flag i had reached the chapter
in which the detective with the sandy beard
had found the proofs and was about to show
who drew the lemon when i turned the
page i found that some one had torn out
the last few chapters and so far as i know
mabel still has her other husband and the
other one too and the other husband and
the other one both have the lemon


the railroad mans magazine

  it was the most unsatisfactory book i ever
read

  i and my headache had been keeping
company for about a week when miss fow-
ler came in one afternoon all excited

  the tunnels finished she whistled as
she came alongside my little cradle and
the mail special leaves albuquerque to-mor-
row night your friend mr goldsworthy is
coming into winslow to-night

  anybody coming with him i asked

    every one-that is all the other officials
mr arnold and mr martin and the rest of
the party

  and fido the one-eyed poodle i
asked

   and what   she answered

   excuse me i refer to mr ellington
wallerheit smartley advisory engineer for
the western lines once of san francisco
now of supai he is the gentleman with the
half-grown crutch and the lone window-
glass

  oh hadnt you heard about him

   havent heard anything to speak of since
the explosion

  well mr murray there is something
mighty queer in that mans actions he left
for san francisco the evening after the acci-
dent at the tunnel he didnt wait to see if
they reached you poor men he went right
back to supai and caught the evening pas-
senger

  this evidence was being considered by the
detective with the red whiskers and the bald
head when a step like a lame elephant sound-
ed in the hall and a voice like a steam cal-
liope drifted into the ward

  if i was color blind i would be able to
tell that voice as far as i could hear it den-
ny reagan was in town and for once i was
sure glad to see him for i felt certain that
he had the missing chapter of my book

  denny came into the room bringing that
irish grin and his danger-signal nose with
him denny was a mighty good engineer
but he wasnt much on grammar he would
say haint got for dont got but after
you knew him as well as i did you didnt
mind such little mistakes

   well says denny when he got inside
the room without cornering the door hows
the biy

  as miss fowler had left the room i just
talked as i felt i wanted to know once for
all whether i was a billionaire or a pauper

   its none of your business how i am
denny about all i want out of you is the
exact -ton- of what happened on the out-ide

of that tunnel during the four hundred and
twenty-seven years bart and i and the other

animals were on the inside

  foirst down said denny come auld
man arnold makin a mile a minute and
about two train-lengths beninst him was
ginirel manager martin an whin they saw
the lay-out arnold stays on the job and
martin and me goes back to supai to tiligraf
fer the doctor and the nurse ter have thim
on th scene of garbage well whin we got
up to supai martin rushes over to the var-
nished wagon an tells the womin folks and
say-

  denny had to stop and wipe his forehead
with his handkerchief and shake his head
then he popped off suddenly

  what th divil do youse think th
ginirel managers daughter - the wan with
th eyes like a fawn-well youse wont be-
lieve it but she let out a scream that you
could have heard clean down to fairmount
carry on well i niver saw th like the
only way the auld man could quiet her was
to take her down to the tunnel

  it was real nice of denny to tell me just
the part of the story i wanted right there
i decided that denny was a better engineer
than i had give him credit

   and thin-the waitin be me soul ive
lived some long days mesilf but none of
them was as long as them two days while
we was a tryin to push half a mountain
away wid a toothpick the doctor got there
an that woman wid th stripes on-ah-ha
th wan what made a grab fer yes th minit
your dirty face come through th hole in the
ground

  now denny i interrupted miss
fowler is a perfect lady and you must not
associate her name with a common mis-
guided rough-neck work-train conductor like
myself

  ah thats all right me biy thats all
right its a priest youll be needin worse
than a doctor

   but return to the story denny i said
endeavoring to guide him gently back to the
real subject

  yis resumed denny gitting away
from the vicinity iv matrimony an back to
th accident after miss fowler had
glombed onto you thin out comes the mexi-
can what i understand was almost punc-
tured be th failin rocks and thin-

   and then- but denny had to wipe his
forehead again

thin th rest of th greasers come out
and that man dugan what goldie says is a
on short time



hero and thin comes goldie with his hands
bleeding an lookin like hed bin run
through a wringer

   and where was miss martin the general
managers daughter i asked

   well baldy murray said denny  i
dont know where she was before goldie
came out but after goldie came out she was
right where goldie was

  dennys amazement was the most natural
thing in the world for denny has had no
experience with women but to me the an-
nouncement was just what  expected

  i would have liked to have heard more of
the details but miss fowler came back to
the room just then and informed denny
that the doctor had instructed that i should
not be allowed to talk much for a few days

  sure says denny thats right that
man talked enough after they brought him
out of the well up there to last both ye for
a time

  while he laughed one of those gentle
chuckles which sound like a boiler-maker
tickling a flue-slieet with a sledge-hammer
miss fowler got awful red in the face and
i-well i began to figure

   you see ever since the day bart goldie
said he would build that tunnel i had been
betting with myself that he would ever since
he showed that he wanted that girl i had
been plunging that he would get her and
when i get to plunging i play to the limit

  i was almost through figuring at ten
oclock that night when miss fowler came
into the room to see if i was asleep i
didnt have the exact amount of my win-
nings but i was sure that it was enough to
keep two people in moderate comfort for the
rest of their natural lives provided one of
them kept working regular - and i told
her so

  are you asleep she asked after i had
finished

  no im not asleep i replied and
whats more im not out of my head i just
want you to know that-

  but whats the use i never did feel so
good in all my life

  the next morning about eleven oclock i
had callers one of them was bart goldie
and the other was the best-looking woman in
the world barring one-miss martin

  mr martin and mrs martin were in the
party but they didnt count much and left
early but bart and lois-thats just what
lie called her right to her face-remained
and talked to me for almost an hour

the

   none of us said very much but say that
room was so full of looks that you just
couldnt keep in the clear for them they
were just ready to go when bart stepped over
to the bed and stuck out his hand

    they tell me that when you fell to the
ground from the force of the explosion you
came so near cracking your head that you
werent responsible for what you said and
my advice to you young fellow is to just
repeat it all-now that you know what you
are doing

    ive got my fingers crossed i replied
feeling like a sheep ive already said it
and it took	

  then while im congratulating you
baldy allow me to say that lois and i are
going to san francisco on the mail-train to-
morrow its to be a sort of honeymoon
you know only its to be before the wed-
ding we are going to put off the wedding
until you are able to be the best man

   i	got well so fast after that i was able
to sit on the veranda the next morning and
watch the mail-train pull out

   on the rear was martins private car and
the martin family including bart the
mail-train had made a great record over the
first and second division for all the men
had caught the spirit which had built that
supai cut-off and the big tunnel at barts
suggestion denny reagan was given the job
of pulling the mail-train over the third

   you dont need to take my word for it
but just go and look at the train-sheet he
put that mail-train over the third in four
hours less time than it was ever run before

  then we waited the reports came in
along the line the mail special was hold-
ing up to the schedule this time and it went
into san francisco right on the dot with
the fastest time ever made between chicago
and the coast to its credit more waiting
and then one day there came this telegram

  baldy murray care of miss fowlers
  home for bachelors winslow arizona
  we built that track we got that mail con-
  tract we won the ladies come on in lets
  take a vacation

   we went just before we went i dropped
over to the hon charles flynns office
by stuttering for an hour and making a
few signs i was able to make him under-
stand that i wanted a marriage license

   then i got even with bennett i asked
him to go over and witness the ceremony
and im a goat if he didnt go

ber for an indication of the features in the
railroad mans magazine that our readers liked
best has brought forth so many varied replies that
we are repeating it again this month at the end
of the carpet you will find a coupon if you
have not already cast your vote we trust you will
turn to it and follow the instructions letting us
know where you stand

  this is only a gentle reminder for we want to
hear from you it is good to get your views on
anything pertaining to the magazine we sit up
day and night scratching our sand dome for ideas
that will interest and entertain if we are success-
ful it is good to know we are on the right track

  now that we are on this subject we would like
to say a few words regarding those who write us

  there is nothing so annoying or insulting as an
anonymous or unsigned letter

  if a man has anything to say he should have the
courage to let the editor know who he is and where
he lives

  the printing of his name rests with him if he
does not wish to have it published he need only
say so and sign his initials or a nom de guerre
which n plain railway english is a fictitious
monacher

filled to the markers with perishable matter-
which bears no name or is signed with the igno-
minious and frazzled cognomen of such well-
known back numbers as  vox populi  constant

basket as fodder for the goat

  if you intend to write us-and we welcome your

want to know with whom we are talking suppose
while conversing on an important subject with an-
other man there was a screen placed between you
and him and you could not see each other what
would you think of that

  to get back on the main track

  we will begin two new serials in the december
number they arc ftesli from the shop painted
red oil over and have an action that is similar to
the fast mail crossing the prairie

graph operator robert fulkerson hoffman has
written a story of a christmas type-it is entitled
that night with mitzler and is one of the
best stories that this well-known fiction writer has
sent us that is some praise for mr hoffman
has contributed to this magazine several short
stories that take front rank in this class of litera-
ture

  charles w sanders who has not been in our
columns for some months will contribute a start-
ling narrative of a railroad domestic trouble and
 honk and horace through their esteemed chron-
icler eminet f harte tell what befell them when
they returned to uncles farm

  among the special articles will be thomas a
edisons days as a news-butcher telling how this
wizard of the century during his idle moments in
the baggage-car conceived some of the ideas that
have revolutionized the world it is written by
frank marshall white

drinking cups in railway trains

wisconsin recently passed a law which pro-
hibits railway trains from carrying public
drinking cups and the wisconsin state board of
health has issued an order instructing trainmen
on all roads crossing the state to put the cups away
when the state line is crossed and not to produce
them again until the trains are out of the state
medical men health boards and all people who
take more than an ordinary interest in their own
health will commend this action
s

the railroad mans magazine

  public drinking-cups public hair-brushes and
all things of the sort are looked upon as conveyers
and purveyors of not merely ordinary diseases but
diseases of the most malignant character the
health of a nation is one of the strongest pillars of
its success

  the new law in wisconsin by some people and
by some railroads may seem a rather high-handed
interference with public comfort but we fully be-
lieve so far as railroads are concerned that if
they have any doubt as to the hardship caused by
such interference such doubts will not long en-
dure-

  public education in sanitary methods is making
rapid progress and we believe that the people
only need some little help to aid them in giving
their quota toward a general trend to ultimate per-
fection if every railroad in the united states
will accept the new wisconsin law as an inspira-
tion and voluntarily remove drinking-cups from
their trains they will do the country a service that
cannot be measured in words

  it is a simple matter to insist that each and every
passenger bring his own tankard drinking-glasses
and tin cups are so inexpensive that they could
easily be brought on a journey and discarded when
the passenger reaches his destination there is
now being manufactured a drinking-cup of waxed
paper for individual service which can easily be
crumpled up and thrown away when once used

  we suggest that the railroads have the courage
to order all public drinking-cups from their trains
and to supply the news-butchers with a stock of
these individual cups to be sold at a nominal cost

the recent forest fires

recent forest fires in the western states
cause many to speculate on their origin
perhaps no more foolish reason is advanced than
that the railroads should be held responsible we
want to know when a spark from a locomotive set
fire to a tree of any size such a combustion
would be worth looking at from many scientific
view-points

  the newspapers have opened their columns to
a manner of queer theorists hoping to prevent a
ci astrophe similar to that of last summer one
of these nimble-minded gentry has stated that all
locomotives running through the forest lands should
be changed to oil-bumc-rs in summer and to coal-
burners in winter

  we move that he be sentenced to pay the cost of
the change each year

  forest fires are due to many things they sel-
dom start at the base of the trees one of the
most frequent causes is due to the igniting of dry
leaves on the topmost branches by the rays of the
sun the smouldering fires of tramps fanned by
the wind is another menace and perhaps the
most prevalent

  another cause and one that should lc fully in-
vestigated by the government is laid at the door

of the hired forest fighters it has been charged

that these fighters who receive thirty cents an
hour start a blaze so that their work may last
longer mr cecil the assistant district forester
notified washington on august  that there was
no doubt that the fires in the crater national
forest and at medford resulted from incendiarism
and that new fires were being set constantly he
started twenty-five scouts to catch the culprits

this is a serious chargc and should be investi-
gated to the very last scrap of evidence and it is
stated there is positive evidence in washington
that it is true

   another by cy warman

which appear in the carpet this month we

tle will the lights be white for beauty and
imagery and pure poetic feeling is just as good as
you will find in any volume by longfellow tenny-

   will the lights be white

by cy warman

     oft when i feel my engine swerve

     as oer strange rails we fare

     i strain my eves around the curve
     for what awaits us there

     when swift and free she carries me
     through yards unknown at night

     i look along the line to see
     that all the lamps are white

     a blue light rep track crippled car

the green light signals slow

     the red light is a danger light

     the white light let her go

     again the open fields we roam

     and when the night is fair

     i gaze up in the starry dome

     and wonder what is there

     for who can speak for those who dwell
     behind the curving sky

     no man has ever lived to tell
     just what it means to die

swift toward lifes terminal i trend

     the run seems short to-night

     god only knows whats at the end

     i hope the lamps are white

   walschaerts valve-gear

people interested in railroads who chance to
live near the great trunk lines have noticed
the remarkable change in locomotive design which
has taken place in the last three or four years and
on the editorial carpet



which is due to the increasing use of the walschaert
valve-gear the locomotives equipped with this
gear present a distinctly different appearance from
those operating with the old-style stephenson link-
motion the first is mounted on the outside of the
locomotive the latter out of sight between the
frames

   the difference is particularly noticeable when run-
ning at high speed--the lines of flashing light made
by the flying steelwork of the walschaert rods and
links give a locomotive the appearance of a gigantic
insect fleeing on mighty legs

  in this issue of the railroad mans magazine
we publish a complete description of this wonder
mechanism by robert h rogers it is valuable to
railroad men and all mechanics for it is the last
word on this all-important phase of locomotive
practise

  egide walschaert the inventor was born in the
little belgian town of mechlin ninety years ago he
made application for a patent on his gear when he
was only twenty-four years old he died in  -
just as the great railroads were making tardy recog-
nition of his genius to the memory of this modest
patient inventor the world owes a deep debt of
gratitude

test for concrete ties

t he american concrete and steel railroad tie
company has received an order from the
terminal railroad association of st louis for a
section of their concrete ties to be placed under the
tracks in the yards at st louis as all the railroads
entering st louis use the terminal tracks this will
be a test for steel ties worth noticing

   a section of these ties was placed several weeks
ago under the rails of the main line of the alabama
great southern railroad they have been passed
over by the passenger and freight trains of this
company and according to statements from offi-
cials of the road have measured up to every re-
quirement

  concrete cross-ties have been made before this
but on being tested have exhibited a lack of elas-
ticity making them impracticable as a rigid road-
bed is injurious to rolling stock however this tie
is said to overcome this objection it is made in
two sections being disjoined in the middle thus
giving elasticity a cross-section extends out on
each side slightly beveled from the center bearing
to each end of this cross-section which allows the
rail the necessary spring a steel bar countersunk
is placed on top of the tie sections which joins the
rail extending under the rail and clamped on the
outside of the rail while a steel clamp on he inside
of the rail resting against a boss on the steel bar
and inside of the rail is secured to the cement tie
by a bolt running through the tie this arrange-
ment makes it impossible for the rails to spread or
turn over

   the problem of securing a cross tie to substitute
wood has long been a subject of deep concern to all
railroads the life of the present wood tie is from

 five to seven years while that of the concrete tie is
 practically indefinite

the fast freight

by ellis b harris

 a short toot toot from the engine flute
 and a  high-ball  from the year

 the switch is set by an old-time  vet

 and the block for the main line clear

 theres a bird-like trill from the triples bill

 as the shoes from tread drop free

a creak and a clank from the draw-bar shank

 in the crunch of the coil to the key

 a short quick bark a flash in the dark

from the door where the hot flames play

 a trembling slip-a sand-bound grip

 and the fliers under way

 through the bustling yard where the earth is jarred
 by the dip of the giants careen

and the switch-lights wink to the clinkity-clink

 as they flash from red to green

from the pop-valve twined in the cutting wind

 fly streamers of hissing white

like ribbons of pearl in the swish and whirl

 or a ghost in a frolic of night

 a mile ahead theres a twinkling red

 and the distant echoes mock
 the long clear note from the whistles throat

 as it calls for the interlock

 then-presto-click like a magic trick

 and the crimson flashes white

in the wizards power from the signal-tower

 as it snaps the de-rail tight

 theres a swish and sway through the right of way
 and the jar of the wheel-trucks leap

 as the red caboose tears the gravel loose

 in the draft of its swing and sweep

 while the grass bends low in the undertow

 and its tendrils twist and strain
 to join the crowd of the atomic cloud

 in pursuit of the speeding train

 a crash and roar-in the tunnels more-

 the dart of a cannon-ball-

 while the cinders hail through the stifling gale
 that recoils from the rocky wall

 then out from the mouth and away to the south
 where the mississippi flows

 and a queenly craft with her wheel abaft

 the softest signal blows-


the railroad mans magazine

coo-oo coo-oo as if lo woo
  swift mercury from his rout

but his winged heels mfick her appeals
  with a roar of a scornful flout

a click-dack-r click-clack-clack

  on on to the busy mart

with roll and pitch oer frog and switch

  up close to its throbbing heart-

then a grinding sound where the wheels turn round
  and the brakes are tightly pressed

while the bells loud chime rings in on time

what happened to bill

one of our readers at present residing in
guantanamo cuba sends us the following
letter from a friend it adds another chapter to
the long story of railroad men in south america

  we found a nice bunch of fellows on the pan-
ama railway and the train-master passed us to
panama without a question there t left dodson
and took the boat for lima or rather callao which
is the seaport i found a tremendous difference in
the rates charged for passage on this steamer
first-class fare was more money than i had but
deck passage was surprisingly cheap i invested
in that and fixed the rest of it with a steward as
soon as they cleared the yard without any trouble
at all most of the passengers were customers of
his as that seemed to be the usual method of pro-
cedure

  arrived in lima o k and on reporting found
that my job was at the front and i had to cross
the top of the hill to get to it many people are
made very sick by the rarefied air at the summit
and they set a car off up toward the top for those
who wish to go back

  i remembered your theory about equalizing the
ressure of air on the ear-drums by frequent swal-
lowing during the ascent and whether that had
anything to do with it or not i suffered no incon-
venience except from the cold i found use for
all the clothes i could comfortably carry and was
not any too warm at that the indians who live
in those mountains seem utterly indifferent to the
cold you often see them standing barefooted in
the snow to watch the train go by

   i drew a freight run bought a lot of clothes and
talked myself into a good tight caboose with a
good stove in it had pulled down a couple of
pays learned the road and was beginning to figure
- n how long it was going to take me to save that
two thousand when-it happened

  wc were running down the hill on the inside
of the mountains with five flats loaded with
cholo laborers and their families moving camp
ahead of the engine

   i did not like the make-up but there was no help
for it as there was no siding where wc picked
them up the line was nearly all sharp curves
tvith the country straight up on one side of the
track and straight down on the other just a
rooked scratch on the hillside

  i took the head-end myself put a  cholo 
brakeman on the third car back to pass signals
and we started wc were dropping down at about
fifteen miles an hour when i sighted a big boulder

that had rolled from up-country somewhere right
onto the middle of the track

  i signaled and yelled but that brakeman was
talking to a woman and the engine cab was out of
sight behind the curve of course a woman was
the cause of my trouble as usual though i didnt
even know her

  i sprung the air side-stepped and some few of
the people fell off but three cars were pushed over
the edge and fell rolling down an almost perpen-
dicular slope for about three hundred feet

  something like two hundred men women and
children went with them and were all of them who
could not fly more or less hurt twenty-one were
found dead up to the time i left i had a main line
sounder in the caboose and cut in on the wire to
report and order the ambulance

  then i consujted with the engineer as to the best
thing for us to do you know the law there holds
the captain and maquinista responsible for
any injuries caused by their train the engineer
said that he was afraid to take to the country with
its ice snow and indians in the mountains with
dwellings few and far apart and preferred lo stay
and take his chances with the authorities i dont
think that he was really afraid of the country he
was too bull-headed to run

  i rubbered into the jail at lima once and pre-
ferred to die some other way i stayed by the
wreck as long as i could do anything to help the
situationbut when the relief train was reported
i packed my grip taking the cholo brakeman
who had caused the trouble with me i faded away
the brakeman did not want to go at first but as i
needed him for guide interpreter and pack animal
i talked the fear of the law into him until he was
soon as anxious as i was to escape

  i dont like to think about that trip i have
been told since that i could have gotten out through
brazil via the amazon river with less hardship
but the only trail i knew was the pacific ocean so
i headed west that is the roof of the world all
right and it isnt a flat roof either it is clear up
above civilization nothing can live long up there
except those indians and the llamas the mule
line is just above the snow line and they use llamas
for packing freight in the high hills

  a llama is a slightly overgrown goat who spits
at you instead of butting they can live and
thrive on snow and mighty thin air-and there is
nothing else up there there are mighty few towns
and roads in the country but i had to keep away
from the few there were for i did not want to
meet the ruralies

   i had to sacrifice speed to safety all the way and
it was forty-two days after the wreck when i final-
ly sneaked into santa and put up at a sailors
boarding-house down on the water-front

  i was a wreck i didnt know myself when i
looked in a glass i got a suit of clothes from the
boarding-house slop-chest and when the panama
boat came along i managed to get aboard and stow
away i was afraid to book a passage and did not
have enough money left anyway gave a steward
all i had except five dollars to fix me up for pan-
ama and kept out of sight until we had passed the
last town on the coast of peru 

  when t went up on deck i found two mining
engineers from some mines just beyond where i
had the wreck and they gave me the first news i
had heard of it they said that the engineer of
the wrecked train was in jail and the best they
could expect for him was a five-year sentence
on the editorial carpet



  that made me glad i had taken a chance i
would go through it again rather than spend five
years in one of their jails

  they also told me that the whole peruvian army
had my description and orders to bring me in dead
or alive they could hardly believe that i had ac-
tually made a getaway and it certainly was a mira-
cle for an american traveling alone arid on foot in
that country is bound to attract considerable at-
tention and a gringo isnt very well liked anyway
that road owes me three days pay but under the
circumstances i dont think i will go back after it

casey jones

editor thf railroad mans magazine

for the general information of railroad men
through the circulation of your valuable
magazine i would like to say a word or two
in regard to one particular engineer who has been
instrumental in immortalizing the locomotive as
mark twain immortalized the steamboat

  that man was john luther jones better known
from coast to coast as  casey jones

  he was born at cayce kentucky in  and
he spent his boyhood days on a kentucky farm
when he was nineteen years of age he fired a loco-
motive on the mobile and ohio railroad and later
occupied a position of a similar nature on the il-
linois central

  in  he was promoted to the position of
engineer which he held with honor until his death

  he was transferred from water valley missis-
sippi and ran a freight engine there until he was
eligible to the chicago and new orleans limited
and it was on this midnight run on march  
that he lost his life in a rear-end collision with a
freight-train at vaughans mississippi

  by his amiable disposition and smiling face he
had friends by the hundreds the song bearing
his name was written and sung by an old round-
house darky by the name of wallace sanders by
the merry jingle of the song it is evident that the
author never knew trouble or sorrow for he turns
a house -of sorrow into a gay carnival

  i can call to mind many kindnesses performed by
jones it is no more than right that such men
should not be forgotten so easily

the longest bridge

editor the railroad mans magazine

your september number states that the long-
est bridge in the world is the lion bridge at
sangong china which is five and a quarter
miles in length what about the norfolk and
southern railroad bridge across albemarle sound
eastern north carolina from edenton to mackays
kerry which is about six miles long

  this bridge was just completed at a cost of one
million dollars and is said to be the longest bridge
across navigable water in the world there is a
bridge also on the l and n in louisiana across
lake pontchartrain about twelve miles long

another old poem

editor the railroad mans magazine

here is an old railroad poem which i found
in an old scrap-book in a tower on the erie
railroad	j h roy

                       rochester new york

      the ham at cb tower

into the chief despatchers office

       one day there walked a man

the chief he looked him over

and decided he was a ham

mr chief i am an operator

a job i want and quick

       if you have any vacancies

       i think i could work third trick

       now it happened there was an opening
       at a little place called birr

       the despatcher sent him down there
       at fifty dollars per

       the ham went to work at midnight

it nearly made him weep

       he got so very sleepy

that soon he dropped asleep

at two am the ham awoke-

it made him have a pain

       for he looked out through the window
       and espied a coming train

       the ham gave a start and jumping up
       he pulled over the wrong switch

        and right in front of his station
        the train ran in the ditch

       the ham was much excited

       and he looked around with fright

       he could see the big electric chair-

to him twas an awful sight

        he could stand the strain no longer

so with an awful bound

       he jumped right through the window

and landed on the ground

      this ham is now a-working

       for a ham factory-please dont weep-

       he is the managers assistant
       at thirteen bones per week

we apologize to miss herzog

editor the railroad mans magazine 

in your last issue a writer speaking of miss
sophie herzog the lady surgeon of the st l
b and m ry gives certain erroneous im-
pressions of that grand old lady miss herzog at
the time of the building of the brownsville road was
s

the railroad mans magazine

between fifty-five and sixty years old and weighed
but a little short of two hundred pounds probably
more the reporter gives the impression of a
small young woman who rode broncos willy-nilly

  miss herzog is not ashamed of her age and
weight and will doubtless sustain my contentions
if questioned she is living at kingsville texas

  somebody let his imagination have full swing and
didnt make use of his eyes

tunneling the sierras

for many years past the railway officials of the
southern pacific have been seriously con-
sidering the feasibility of boring an immensely
long tunnel through a part of the sierra nevadas

  this was one of the pet schemes of the late mr
harriman surveys were completed several years
ago and also the drawings etc the project has
been pronounced entirely practicable by the engi-
neers of the company but for various reasons
work on the beginning of this gigantic bore has
been deferred from time to time

  it is reported now on good authority that the
contractors who have charge of the work on the

southern pacific cut-off near auburn california
have secured an additional contract that will ex-
tend this cut-off from colfax to goldrun in the
opinion of the general railroad public such an ex-
tension can mean only one thing-that this long-
talked-of tunnel is to be bored at last and that
actual operations will be commenced in the near
future

  the projected tunnel will be on the main line
between blue canon and donner lake this im-
mense bore will be about six miles long will cost
between five million dollars and six million dollars
and several years will be required to complete it
it will be the longest tunnel in the united states
and one of the longest in the entire world it will
obviate twenty miles of heavy grades and snow-
sheds

the steepest broad-gage

editor the railroad mans magazine

in reply to g n g fulton illinois you state
that the steepest broad-gage is over raton
mountain in new mexico in my belief the
steepest is the el paso and southwestern railroad
which runs from alamogordo to cloudcroft new
mexico some of it is four per cent and one part
is five per cent it is also one of the shortest curved
roads of which i know

       mark well the group of pictures on the left and the group on the right one shows
 men who have utilized their spare time and gained positions of influence and worth the
 other shows the class of men who are ever struggling along in poor jobs they have
 just as much spare time as the time improver but they waste it some waste it on the
 corner in the pool room at the theater or otherwise

     every man is entitled to some pleasure and recreation but as time is an asset more
 valuable even than money every man owes it to himself to utilize a certain portion of his
 spare time for self improvement

    if you have two hours a day unoccupied we guarantee that one hour of that time
 properly applied under i c s direction will qualify you for a good position at double triple
 or quadruple your wages

     this is not a mere statement for you to believe or not believe as you choose it is backed
  up by a world of proof that no one can deny we can send you the names and addresses
  of thousands of men who have advanced from lowly positions to some of the nost promi-
  nent places in business science and art

     for instance ernest murphy who used his spare time under i c s direction was
     advanced from carpenter to assistant consulting engineer j j loud jumped from
     laborer to assistant electrician joseph worden telegraph operator to draftsman
     wilson p hunt from apprentice to president of a large manufacturing concern s g
     brinton from janitor to the position of assistant postmaster

     these are only a few of thousands the names and addresses of whom you can
     have on application so you can ask them for yourself you will find they had
     no more brains than you  that they had no greater ability that they had no
     more spare time that they had no more spare cash but they did have the

monthly magazine de-
voted to progressive
methods of poultry
keeping and we will in-
clude without charge
a copy of the latest
revised edition of the
philo system book

ro the average poultry-
man that would seem
impossible and when we tel
you that we have actually
done a  poultry bus-
iness with  hens on a
corner in the city garden 
feet wide by  feet long
we are simply stating facts
it would not be possible to

of the systems of poultry
keeping recommended and
practiced by the american
people still it can be ac-
complished by the

philo
system

note  condition of lliesi tlircp month old pullets these pullets nnd their ancestor for seven
generation harp never been allowed to run outsido i he roop

the philo system is unlike all other ways of keeping
poultry

and in many respects just the reverse accomplishing things in
poultry work that have always been considered impossible and
gening unheard-of results that are hard to believe without seeing

  the new system covers all branches of the work
necessary for success
from selecting the breeders to marketing the product it tells how
to get eggs that will hatch how to hatch nearly every egg and how
to raise nearly all the chicks hatched it gives complete plans in
detail how to make everything necessary to run the business and it
less than half the cost required to handle the poultry business in any
other manner

two-pound broilers in eight weeks

are raised in a space of less than a square foot to the broiler and
the broilers are of the very best quality bringing here  cents a
pound above the highest market price

our six-month-old pullets are laying at the rate of
 eggs each per month

in a space of two square feet for each bird no green cut bone of
any description is fed and the food used is inexpensive as compared
with food others are using

  our new book the philo system of poultry keeping
gives full particulars regarding these wonderful discoveries with
simple easy-to-understand directions that are right to the point and
 pages of illustrations showing all branches of the work from
start to finish

dont let the chicks die in the shell

    one of the secrets of success is to save all the chickens that are
fully developed at hatching time whether they can crack the shell
or not  is a simple trick and believed to be the secret of the
ancient egyptians and chinese which enabled them to sell the
chicks at  cents a dozen

chicken feed at fifteen cents a bushel

    our book tells how to make the best green food with but little
trouble and have a good supply any day in the year winter or sum-
mer it is just as impossible to get a large egg yield without green
food as it is to keep a cow without hay or fodder

   our new brooder saves  cents on each chicken

    no lamp required no danger of chilling over-heating orburn-
ing up the chickens as with brooders using lamps or any kind of
fire they also keep the lice off the chickens automatically or kill
any that may be on them when placed in the brooder our book
gives full plans and the right to make and use them one can
easily be made in an hour at a cost of  to  cents

    dear sir-i have followed your system as close as i could
the result is a complete success if there can be any improvement
on nature your brooder is it the first experience i had with your
system was last december i hatched   chicks under two hens
put them as soon as hatched in one of your brooders out of doors
and at the age of three months i sold them at c a pound they
then averaged v lbs each and the man i sold them to said they
were the finest he ever saw and he wants all i can spare this season

yours truly	a e nelson

closing days of a

great piano offer

  january first this year we perfected certain plans
for a twelve months campaign

  these plans involved the placing of at least one
schmoller  mueller piano in each new commu-
nity in the united states

 up to that time many neighborhoods -many
communities-knew about this sweet toned piano

  but where there was one such community-we
realized there was doubtless a hundred which
knew nothing of the merits of this superior instru-
ment

  of this piano-which had satisfied music lovers
in all walks of life-the humble cottager and
family-

  as well as those who enjoy more largely of this
worlds goods

  thus our problem for this year of grace -
was to make better known the superior qualities of
the sclnnoller  mueller piano

  to bring about its successful introduction into
new neighborhoods-new communities everywhere

  we realized at the outset that the task was a
large one-one which only a well-organized busi-
ness institution could successfully bring to a happy
conclusion

  our estimated output for the year was 
schmoller  mueller pianos five thousand
homes must be found into which we could place a

schmoller si mueller

 fire thousand neighborhoods
and communities to find -five
thousand sales to be made had
we other than a high grade-a
sweet toned-a well-built-a fully
-naranteed piano to offer -the
task we set ourselves to thus ac-
complish would have been insur-
mountable

  but with a piano like the sweet
and mellow toned schmoller 
-mueller- with years record back
it -living the greatest of pleas-
ure in the homes of thousands of
satisfied music lovers-and with a
well-organized company to handle
the business-this problem was
lessened to the question embody-
ing the plan of selling

  we evolved a selling plan which
has been most enthusiastically re-
ceived

  a plan when explained is easily
understood by every intending
buyer

  briefly here is our plan

 to give the first buyer in
each new community or neigh-
borhood this year a close
wholesale first buyers price

 a schmoller  mueller piano in
each community and neighborhood is the
be-t adverilsement we desire for our jiano
one schmoller  mueller piano sold in
new neighborhood has time and again
brought about the sale of     and
more schmoller a mueller pianos-within
a short time ihereafter

  i- rig the first buyer a close first
lnyers price would work to the more
-ur-ly and quickly accomplish the desired
end-the placing of  schmoller 
mueller pianos in that many new com-

t

ate the result has been gratifying

 rare picture offer allhough pompeian is the most
 widely used face cream still you-and millions of other

 necessity of a completely cleansing and delightfully re-
 freshing product like pompeian or else you cant recall
 its name when you try

   how to fix the name  pompeian in your over-
 worked memory  that is the question it is solved
 we believe by resorting to expensive pictures

    our  pompeian beauties  are so fine that people be-
 come enthusiastic over them they are so valuable lhat
 people frame them and keep them for years as one man
 wrote us-the pompeian beauties are great the cream
 fine you always do what you promise i shall never
 forget pompeian

 me win for pompeian the enthusiasm of americas mil-
 lions and lei me thereby clinch their memory and i
 care not what the pictures cost since our pictures
 do make people enthusiastic and do make them
