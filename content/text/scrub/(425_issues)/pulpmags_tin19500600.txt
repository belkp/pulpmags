ling out of my blaster the rock
pedestal disintegrated  the
grey lump of organism bounced
dully on the floor   

the teletapes ran hot i took a shot of
atomaxadrene and it didnt cure my
headache and i cursed the stuff

these reports were enough to drive any-
one off his nut they came in from all
over the united american continent from
bogota clear down to buenos aires panicked
crowds gathered in town squares every
town village and two-bit hamlet had the
same story and-they all flashed em in to
the admin-centre at washington in due
course everything filtered through to me

  it was two days now since theyd been
first sighted then alarms had crashed out
from coast to coast alarms which hadnt
been sounded in thirty years since the
threatened jap invasion during world war

u

  something had swept over the sun dark-
ening it and the watchers had known it
was no lunar eclipse

  sure it was some new satellite only it
wasnt the moon is a satellite of the
earth and it revolves round the mother
planet in its own fixed orbit but this
damned thing just hovered there astron-
omers reckoned it was around seven hun-
dred miles from the earth which meant it
was outside the atmosphere but by what
unholy trick of witchcraft had the thing
been made to stop in the one position as
though held there by some intangible
magnetic field or nuclear force it didnt
have an orbit of its own it just moved as
the earth did as though some snooper had
planted it there to keep an eye on tha
an otto kensch thriller of a science baffling organism
which killed by thought what chance did man have
against such a menace

old united states an eye could be

  it seemed to take a liking to new york
thats where it was anchored in space over
new york i didnt think much of its taste

  the wise boys in the state department
got into a panic and they had a strato-
rocket fleet loaded up with atom bombs
ready to take off for russia until they
got a sizzler of a note from moscow and
what do you think

  youve guessed it there was another
one over moscow okay so we paid off
the rocket fleet and we traded information
on the size location etc of the satellites
theyd gotten into the capital s class by
this time and they were the same all
right astronomers and amateur observers
worked overtime all across old north
america and soviet europe checking their
calculations and making reports

  they were being tapped into my office in
washington in a steady stream until i had
a nightmare that looked like a disney
cartoon only it wasnt and i had a tangled
mass of formulae and greek letters fighting
across my eyes faster than anyone has yet
made a movie camera flick images on to a
screen

  all this happened in two days it was
like a lost weekend only i didnt drink

to get you for a couple of hours and that
girl of yours wont let me through pretty
isnt she

  i just grunted

  he laughed openly then all right so
you wont talk in case you dont know it
sucker im the department of information
always one step ahead of nuclear research
im the guy who organised the ship were
takin off in just one hour to make a survey
of our own home-grown satellite rod
berrymans coming from the post 
do we have to have him as well as you
then you are coming good

  sure im coming youd lose yourself
without me

  okay see you at the drome in an
hour

  so long  said

  there were six of us on the tarmac of
the spacedrome i knew rod berryman i
didnt like newspaper reporters and he
knew it schuman and ross came from
the biological bureau there was pirov
the scientific attache of the soviet embassy
and lyle mumford from information and i
was representing the department of nuclear
research

by atmosphere

 more than one bottle and it was bourbon
 too i had a slug of it after id swallowed
 the atomaxadrene it still didnt work

 a buzzer pounded my brain and  leaned
 wearily across my plex-topped desk and
 switched on the visor i saw the switchgirl

 dr brompton she said mr mum-
 ford wants to get through he said it was
 urgent

 sure i said put him through

 the vision faded out and i saw lyle
 mumfords rugged and ugly face leering at
 me

 i said what are you so happy about
 listen garry he said when are you
 going up

 going up up where i growled

 aw hell why so cagey ive been trying

  we wore space-suits up to our necks
not yet having screwed down the helmets
we were all around the same height and
we looked like a row of giant skittles
standing there until the rocket guardships
pilot taxied the craft out in front of us

  when lyle saw me he walked across to
greet me there was a big rugged grin on
his face

  hallo sourpuss whats eatin you i
didnt get a chance to answer because as
soon as he was close enough to see the
colour of my face he whistfed out say
whats up with you you look washed out
party last night

  i shook my head i havent had a wink

of sleep since those damned satellites hap-
pened on us

  the department i guess lyle said
sympathetically he looked quickly at me
any sign of radioactivity from those
things

  not much the background count of
the geiger-muller tubes wavers between 
and  but thats not serious the normal
was - per minute per square centimetre
of surface

   no i went on its not that i just
havent been able to sleep id sort of drop
into a coma and dream i feel like id
had a cop standing over me all night shoot-
ing questions at me bashing me till 
answered only it wasnt a cop

   thats good anyway lyle murmured

  im not so sure it mustve been a
dream and nothing else but it was as
though someone were trying to prevent me
going up to the satellite    oh i dont
know lets get aboard were late
already

  we screwed our helmets in place and
followed the others

  when we had taken our seats and
adjusted the straps the pilot let the guard-
ship go there was a kick of the rockets
a muffled roar told us in our insulated
cabin that we were off

   one hour later we were cruising in space
making an orbit round the satellite anil
looking for a place to land

	 

   there was nothing remarkable about the
surface of the satellites it was flattish rock
there wasnt a sign of vegetation no water
no life

   it was spinning and near one polar axis
there was a great slab of rock jutting sky-
ward like a primitive temple with an altar
raised to the sun it must have been a

thousand feet high and it looked more
rising as it did sheer up from a plain of
dead-surfaced rock

  this was a department of information
show and lyle acted as captain he looked
round to all of us and asked what do
you say we land by that rock at the pole
it seems to be the only spot of interest

   i didnt like it but everyone else said
yes i didnt answer i had a sort of pre-
monition and black unlovely fear battled
with the ache in my head maybe i was
going mad

  we went down in one of those steep
fast multi-g dives i was used to them
that didnt explain why i was sick and then
blacked out

   i dont know how long i was unconscious
we were resting on the surface of the
satellite when i came to and lyle was
standing over me i caught an anxious
gleam in his eyes through the plastiglass
of his helmet i smiled back

  you dont need to worry lyle i said
through the two-way microphone amplifier
which is built in to all our space-suits
just a bit groggy

   the pilot stayed inside his machine the
rest of the expedition stepped to the ground
gravity was slight and it made us seem
feathery it wasnt exactly a pleasant feel-
ing even though of course we knew the
physical reason for it i was still distinctly
uneasy but i didnt mention my fears to
the others

  now that we could inspect the ground at
close quarters we saw that it was composed
of a granite type of rock which undulated
smoothly it wasnt completely flat but with
rcduced gravitational pull on our legs and
the absence of any sharp edges to the rock
it was easy going 

	the slab of rock rose high above the
horizon it was like an arizona butte a
great pillar of stone laid bare by the erosion
of strata npon strata of softer rock above
and around it

   yet i had the feeling that this pillar was
an edifice that had been made by some con-
sciousness some agency of the mind
human but how could it be no it must
be something completely outside human
comprehension or else i was already mad

   we hurried to the foot of the mountain
it rose above us stark and grey and mag-
nificent glittering in the morning sunshine
death by atmosphere

page 

we started to walk all round the base of the
rock it was close on a mile in circumfer-
ence the only thing of interest that we
noted on the journey was a black six-fool
square hole in the pillar and it was at
ground level  shall always remember the
chill of fear  had when we looked at it
trying to see the end of it we could not

  when we regained our starting point
schuman said it doesnt look too promis-
ing for us eh ross

   dont see what good this tripll do
any of us i growled voicing thus mildly
my fear it was close to terror now

  well said pirov gently we are
scientists and it is our duty to investigate
these things and make our reports to the
people

  ross said  dont like it since weve
been close to this damned rock ive felt

      w

  yes i said eagerly

  ive felt as though someones watching
all we do    oh its fantastic hell lets
get away from this thing and look over the
ground a bit more and then get back to
earth ill feel a hell of a sight safer when
ive got good old terra under my feet
again

  i knew lyle was going to disagree  said
it first

  no its obvious that if theres some-
thing here for us to investigate its inside
this rock i say let us try to get through
that hole we saw on the other side there
might be life inside it

  lyle cut in yes after all theres
absolutely no form of life on the surface
theres some sort of heat generated inside
the satellite it hasnt been within range
of the sun long enough to get heated by
induction and if theres heat inside the
rock there may be life too with a sub-
surface atmosphere to support it

  the fear chilling my spine was like a
knife of liquid air now my instincts told
me that we should follow rosss advice and
get back to earth but there was some-
thing more something greater than my
instinct for self-preservation demanding that
we enter the menacing black hole our only
means of getting inside the pillar and testing
this new possibility

   lets go lyle said

	 

  i could only guess at rosss feelings as
we gazed into that black nothingness which

was six feet in breadth at ground level and
six feet in height it wasnt quite tall enough
for us to move in a comfortably upright
position as we walked our space-suit
helmets tended to scrape along the roof
and we had to droop our shoulders slightly

  the tunnel for such it seemed to be
narrowed inside the rock and we were
compelled to walk in single file wed all
switched on our lighting equipment but
though it worked at full power and would
normally have thrown a wide aura of light
around each one of us the atomic batteries
could do no better than put out a luminous
glow this wasnt the darkness of earth
an absence of light apathetic it was some-
thing more positive a force of darkness
that was attacking us draining us of energy

  some glimmering of the truth was creep-
ing through to me but it was still too
monstrous for me to be able to express my
thoughts my deepmost fears i knew that
this darkness was a protective covering
the very darkness was a living tissue that
held its menace for every man in our party
for me perhaps least of all because i was
beginning to understand it and paradoxic-
ally it was most dangerous to me because
i knew that i would ultimately be the one
to oppose it

  i knew quite impersonally that ross
would be the first one to fall he was sus-
ceptible to the influence yet he could not
understand it suddenly i knew how he
would feel

  lyle as the skipper was number one
in the file behind him came ross and
schuman then pirov i was number five and
berryman come at the rear

  schuman gave the alarm first he saw
the shining outline ahead of him simply fold
up and flop to the ground lyle stopped
and turned around the remaining four of
us crowded up close to see

  lyle barked rod you and schuman
take him back to the outside surface and
see if you can do anything for him if
necessary get him back to the rocket-ship

   said dont bother anyone ross is
dead

  silence met my words a shocked un-
believing silence

  at last lyle said slowly how do you
know that garry

  i felt it myself i said without confi-
dence how could i explain to them
page 

thrills incorporated

either you felt it or you didnt i did
they didnt i added i saw death in my
mind

  berryman laughed shakily let us know
when you see it again dr brompton only
just give us ten seconds warning so we
can get outa here

   i smiled thinly inside my helmet berry-
man would never understand he was only
a fool newspaperman

   ill try anyway i said

  well we cant leave him here lyle
said looking uncertainly at rosss inert
body blocking the passage

  why cant we i wanted to know
harshly then for heavens sake lyle
try to get it in your head that this is not a
sunday afternoon excursion to the botanical
gardens were dealing here with some-

thing that may have vast deadly effect on
the whole human race we cant waste time
on one dead man

   i detected a strangeness in the way lyle
stared at me and my passionate tirade left
me suddenly cold drained of emotion

   all right lyle said abruptly well
leave him here he turned inward again
and led off deeper into the rock we fol-
lowed him in silence a silence that was
drawn out strained to the limit barring all
speech we kept on walking it seemed
endless i guess lyle was beginning to
worry about our oxygen supply  wasnt 
knew we would soon come to the end of the
tunnel

  as we walked we could touch the walls
on either side which we did often  fancy
it encouraged the others it gave them
something concrete to hang on to in the
midst of this horror which had caused the
death of ross the glow from our space-
suits could not light up the tunnel wall so
it was only when our gloved hands felt the
walls receding on both sides of us that we
knew we had got somewhere

  the back of my neck prickled and went
clammy this was where i had been in

my dream the last two nights i knew it
by the feel of the place just as you say
on earth that you know the atmosphere
that a room or locality creates in your
mind that was it the creation of an
atmosphere in the mind

   i saw it first it was the strange ques-
tioner of my dream it had no terror for
me now my understanding of it was grow-
ing with every passing second of time dis-
pelling my fears

   garry what     lyle said sharply
as he saw my light-outlined space-suited
figure break from the orderly file and walk
quickly into the blanket of darkness the
four of them followed me more cautiously
sure-footed i went straight to the centre of
this awesome cavernous pocket in the
midst of the pinnacle of living rock then
 hauled up dead the others grouped
round me and saw what i was pointing at

  there it is lyle i said unemotion-
ally thats the essence of this strange
satellite the reason for its existence

   i was looking at a matt grey sphere sup-
ported on a pedestal rock no one else said
anything they gazed in wonderment

  does it remind you of anything you
schuman youre a biologist

  schuman said theres only a slight
resemblance but yes id say it reminded
me of a disembodied brain

  we made a slight evanescent circle of
light around the thing i reached out my
hand to touch it and as my fingers made
contact it vibrated a blinding flash of
light crossed my brain it was as if my
immediate physical contact with the thing
had at last put to flight all the barriers of
communication which it had been trying
to break down in my mind during the last
two days since the satellites had first
descended upon the earth

  speech is communication by word of
mouth those words conjure up images in
the mind of the listener which convey the
meaning of the person who is talking that
is images are transferred from one mind
to another through their association with
words that is the way ordinary human
beings understand the process

  now i was receiving images from this
brain this entity in front of us but no
words passed between us indeed they
could not for this brain had no material
means of making sound vibrations  sus-
pected then that this utter darkness was a
medium for accelerating the transference of
death by atmosphere

page 

thought waves this thing in front of us
could transmit waves to all of us but out
of this party i was the only one who could
pick up these waves and translate them into
images

  hence our awful black fear at the sight
of the hole in the base of the rock hence
ross death he had been killed by a
sudden violent thought wave vibration it
was fear really which had been induced
in his mind by this thing in front of us
causing death by heart failure a sudden
seizing up of his whole nervous system this
aspect of thought waves was new to us and
therefore terrifying understanding of a
problem or at least its recognition drives
out fear i could only hope that my under-
standing of this monstrosity was adequate
   

  with a conscious effort i shut out the
thought manifestations of the brain and
turned to my companions

  quietly  told them what i knew

  so that was it lyle said and his voice
sounded hollow and awed that was the
strength of your dreams

   yes i said

  schuman said coldly it killed ross it
had no god-dam right to do that i hadnt
heard him so nettled before

  lyle drew out his blaster and pointed it
at the brain

  he said slowly im skipper of this crew
i take full responsibility for this if that
damned thing killed ross theres no know-
ing when itll start again 

  i tried to stop him but  wasnt quick
enough

  lyle didnt fire his blaster not another
sound came from him the gun slid out
of his lingers and rattled dully as it struck
the ground lyle fell on top of it hed
never understand it now

  my mind was full of images they said
to me tell them that anyone who tries to
destroy me will die in the same way it
was stilted speech but that is the only way
i can record what the brain communicated
to me

   told it to schuman and pirov and
berryman

  berryman shuddered anyone got a
cigarette he asked my nerves aint what
they used to be

  shut up berryman i said i was in
charge here now whether they liked it or
not and they knew it

  i formed images in my mind and i spoke
wordlessly to the brain it was rather like
a prayer i said what do you want of
us and why do you kill

  why do you invade my territory here
i countered with another question i
started from the beginning whv have you
come to look down on the earth

  the answer came  was interested is
that enough

  no i said

   have come from the arcturus solar
system i came in search of life i am an
explorer you understand the human race
on earth is the most developed form of life
in your solar system your society and
your thought have developed to its highest
level in america and europe europe is

ahead of you americans but nevertheless
i was interested 

  wait a minute  said do you mean
that you are also over europe now that
these two satellites are both instruments of
your mind

  i do

  the other three members of the party
were fidgeting uncomfortable they must
have been scared to death just standing
there watching me acting like i was in a
trance

  i heard berryman say christ if only 
had a movie camera theyd offer me a
directorship on the march of time 
time my friend said pirov dryly
does not march at this moment it does
not matter either

  schuman said god-dam i knew he
was badly shaken i wasnt exactly blood-
less either lyle had been my friend and
now he was heaped on the floor of this
creatures brain-box but i tried to stay
cool and scientific in my outlook

  why did you kill ross i pursued

  to discourage you from entering i
did not intend his death  tried only to
scare you away

  and lyle

  self-protection

  the answers came pat and their images
were forming in my brain even as my ques-
tion was completed this way of talking
had its disadvantages though it was so
damned cold and impersonal there was
no way of telling what this brain was get-
ting at how could  believe  everything
that was told to me  had no means of
proving the truth of the brains statements

   said why did you pick on me to
communicate with

  only highly developed mathematical
brains respond to the process of thought
communication takes place at a deep level
of consciousness you were not the only
one on earth in america even with whom
 communicated but you are the only one
who has attempted to invade the ifiner
fortress of my thoughts

   had a mental struggle with myself
and not one of my thoughts was private

any longer anything that went on in my
mind was transmitted instantly to this
greedy all-devouring object set on the
pedestal

  the brain forestalled me remember the
warning  gave you on the death of your
friend it said

  i was chilled but a stubborn determina-
tion was battling for supremacy  told
myself that i wasnt just scared because this
thing was strange because even though id
understood the nature of the satellite and
this deep black tunnel we were in this
malignant object which i called a brain still
represented an unknown potentiality with
roots stretching back milliards of light years
through space  knew enough about the
satellite to recognise the danger which could
threaten the earth it seemed to me that
this creature from arcturus while lacking
the characteristics of earth life would

obviously be in a position to dominate man
if onlv by virtue of its amazing power of
thought

  i had a feeling and it was growing on
me that this thing was here to orobe the
secrets of the earths form of life what
came after that i was wondering was this
just the beginning of attacks on the earth
attacks from outer space

  i could feel the tension building un inside
of me as the brain followed my thinking
not liking it i risked one more question

  are these satellites in turn n instru-
ment of your brain is this you or is this
just a nart of you

  i felt the scorn in the clipoed images that
crossed my mind these are my eyes and
a sufficient portion of my brain tobe able
to communicate with the parent organism
on arcturus

  who are you are you just one or is
there a race like you on arcturus

  there are many of us yes but we are
not numerous like the earth races there
are exactly seventy-eight other such entities
as myself on arcturus

  what form do you take there

  that you would not understand
somehow i had to destroy this thing
more and more i could feel its cynical
menace its cloaking of its real purpose
under a series of pictures in my mind the
brain was wakening to its danger and
already  could feel its strange compelling
influence at work on my mind a sort of
creeping paralysis

  i whipped out my blaster

  berryman saw it and yelled look out
brompton

  i called out to the other three get out-
side fast as you can bring the guardship
round to this side take off if youve got
to and be ready to pick me up in the
basket 

  they took to their heels the three of
them i felt the cold hammer blows of the
brains thought waves battering at my con-
sciousness my head ached violently i
vomited but i brought the blaster to bear
on the thing on the pedestal

  i felt an easing of the pain in my head
sickened  turned to look for the others
two of them dropped in their tracks
soberly i knew that pirov and schuman had
gone two of the best scientific minds of
this generation sacrificed to this malignant
creature
death by atmosphere

  one man kept running i didnt need to
be told that it was berryman nothing
could get through that thick skull of his

   i sent a burst of thetrons crackling out of
my blaster the rock pedestal disinteg-
rated the grey lump of organism bounced
dully on the floor there was a momentary
lull inside my head

  i could hardly move my muscles now
but i managed to flex my wrist so that the
blaster pointed down at my feet and i
directed it on to the brain the racket was
terrific my head was seesawing wildly
pins and needles were shooting through my
bloodstream and my heart thudded with
the strain but still all  felt was physical
pain and i wasnt afraid

  the only thing that scared me was the
thought that my blaster wouldnt affect the
thing  kept on shooting till  wondered
if the atomic charge would give out still
id get away next time id bring atom-
shells and space artillery

  a crack split through the floor of the
cave my vision reeked blood-red 
thought that was the mind image symbol
that the thing was disintegrating at last
there came a thunder crash that was pure
external sound and  knew that the end had
come  put a last burst of thetron particles
into the object then i turned and ran for
my life yes my life

   i didnt know how long the satellite could
exist independently of its motive force 
didnt know when it would disintegrate-
completely and by the force of the explo-
sion go rocketing off a free body in space

  space-suits arent made for running in
but gravity was almost non-existent 
could feel the pull growing less with every
stride i took which meant the satellite
must have split up already maybe id never
see sunlight again

  i ran and ran i passed ross body 
saw the square of bright welcoming day
ahead of me my heart gladdened at the
sight of it then i was out upon the gentle
rock surface again	

  my heart was in bad shape it had been
tested to the full inside that cavern of evil
and it was pounding like an old steam
hammer after the exertion of my run it
didnt do my heart any good to see the
ground split right in front of me and a
chasm of sheer empty space yawned up at
me

  i heard the hiss of the guardship over-
head like an angel of deliverance i spoke
to the pilot by radio

  they couldnt land but i didnt mind
that the craft was braking now and a
basket came jerking downward out of a
hatch in its belly held there by two wire
cords the basket dragged over the ground
slowly slowly

   with a great upsurge of relief i leaped
inside it then i was hauled up the basket
stowed away and the hatch closed i col-
lapsed i must have slept then because the
next thing i knew was waking up in a
cool white-walled sanatorium and i
stayed there a week

  i had plenty of time to think of my
friends whod been lostaway out there in
space they were grey sober thoughts
of the five of them only rod berryman
had pulled through grim irony of fate
maybe i thought it was just as well he did
come through no one would have
believed the fantastic story i had to tell
them and they must believe it the
whole world must know and be on guard
against interstellar invasion from arcturus
anyway theyd believe berryman theyd
know that his hard knothead wouldnt
dream up a story like mine

 saw berryman at the end of that week
he said you know the satellite over
europe blew up at the same time ours did

  i nodded tell me did they offer you
that directorship on the strength of your
story  mean

  berryman looked sour march of
rime not a chance they didnt even
believe my story said theyd wait till you
got fit again they wanted to hear it from
you

   i just looked at him and laughed
he stole thoughts cheating his closest friends out of
their unspoken plans - then he stole the thought that
they wished to destroy him  the

thought thief

emile audez worked crouched down
over his drafting board in an attitude
of complete concentration but one thing
was strange about the way he worked his
eyes were closed and his hands moved as
if in obeyance to some mind other than his
own swiftly the sketches took shape on
the papers and when three hours were
elapsed they were complete only then did
the hands cease their labours and the man
straightened up his cadaverous black eyes
opening and becoming alive with excited
interest as he viewed the sketches

  excellent he muttered to himself
excitedly once more  will triumph
once more reap the riches that come from
anothers labours

  swiftly he sorted the sketches and the
written matter that was with them and then
carefully locking one set
in an electronically con- l wnlfr
trolled safe in the wall u
he bundled the others
into a small attache case and hurried from
the room and up the elevator to the roof of
the house on the flat roof stood a small
hangar and through the open door of this
could be seen the small rocket machine
which waited there

  once within the cabin of the machine
emile deftly worked the controls and a
couple of moments later he had the rocket-
car zooming up into the sky and he circled
off to the east and headed across the vast
lands of fertile agriculture where the land
was kept vigorous by the latest fertilisers
and the plants fed by the rain which was
created artificially whenever required and
prevented from materialising when it threat-
ened to rain naturally at the wrong time

  one invention of which he held the patent
was concerned with this prevention of
natural precipitation of rain it had brought
vast wealth to him by way of the royalties
he collected on it too through a vast
range of inventions and discoveries the
name of emile audez was known across
the land fabulous luck was said to have
accompanied his researches for on almost
every occasion on which he had filed a

patent he had beaten another man and twice
it had been big research organisations

   it was sometimes less than hours after
his patent had been filed that another
exactly similar had been brought in for
registration though these men and their
organisations cursed and argued they were
told that the law was quite definite on the
point and that the full benefit of the patent
must go to emile audez

  now he was speeding toward the
patents building in metropilis to file a
claim on yet another invention this time
it was an ejector device for a space ship
which would eject a space-suited man
directly into space without the need of the
tiresome routine of operating an air lock
to the engineers who had to service the
giant inter-planetary liners which broke
down in space the device
jr u if would be a tremendous
her sc noil advantage and emile
smiled wryly as he cal-
culated the possible profits from his patent

  landing quietly on the roof of the office
building he hurried down in the elevator car
and was promptly ushered through to the
man in charge of the office of patents

  well audez marcus slont the egg-
headed jovial man cried his keen penetrat-
ing eyes watching the man closely what
is it this time

  swiftly audez spread the sketches before
slont and that man became engrossed in the
sketches and diagrams then carefulv he
read through the written matter and nodded
his head quietly for all his seeming
joviality he was considered one of the most
advanced men in his field of science and he
was intrigued by the design and arrange-
ment of the device

  excellent he nodded his head approv-
ingly ill have it filed immediately and
see that you get an official receipt

  thank you nodded audez quickly
and slont theres a matter troubling me
considerably as you know in the past
certain persons and groups of people have
come by my secrets in time to make an
effort to beat me to the recording of the
patents on my inventions once more i am
worried about such an attempt if any
person or persons should make an attempt
to file such a device as this i ask that you
hold them here and contact the central
bureau of investigation and have them
arrested it is most important to me that
i find how and where the leak is occurring
something big coming up queried
marcus slont eagerly

  exactly nodded audez quickly you
understand that i work under a great strain
when i am afraid all the time of thieves who
are stealing my secrets

  i understand nodded slont i will do
as you request it has only been your per-
sonal requests in the past that have pre-
vented such action previously

  before it didnt seem necessary emile
explained now it is most essential

  very well then your receipt audez

he plunged and roared
his rocket - car through
every manoeuvre the atomic-
powered motors could take but
that thing stayed with him   

  thank you and good-day to you herr
slont replied emile quickly

  with nervous jerky movements he rose
wheeled round and left the inner office
passed through the outer rooms and was
soon in the passage from where he ascended
to the roof and a few moments later he
had his rocket-car zooming back toward
his country hide-out atop a steep crag of a
mountain which dominated all the lands
from metropilis out across the fertile plains

  something seemed to be amiss with emile
as he parked his car and went down to the
room where he had been working so
feverishly such a short while before once
there he sat down and closed his eyes and
all the power of his will he concentrated on
the image of slonts face for a long while
he picked up nothing that was of interest
and then he listened to the thoughts of slont
as the officer of the patents office received
the man who presented the space-ejector for
patent filing

  emile smiled grimly to himself as he
heard the argument as it registered on the
mind of slont then a time elapsed and
the bureau of investigation was called and
an officer of that department was talking
with slont then fierce wild thoughts began
flashing into audezs mind and he realised
that the man who had come to present the
patent for the space-ejector was escaping
page 

thrills incorporated

  angrily emile cursed as he picked up the
thoughts from the man slonts mind then
with a final angry snarl he realised that it
was of no further use tapping the mind of
the man slont the prisoner had success-
fully made his escape from the roof of the
patents office and was gone emile smiled
nervously as he got up and paced back and
forth up and down the room

  he cursed himself for a fool he had
known that he was plaving with fire when
he tapped the brains of the under-cover
organisation-fitstip sauadron they were
adangerous bunch of rebels with a brilliant
scientific core of men attached to them rv
patenting inventions and reaping the profits
from them the organisation was building nn
its strength to assume world domination and
smash the tight hold held bv the freedom-
loving authorities of the present

  that didnt matter to audez for he had
sufficient wealth now after years of steal-
ing the inventions of others by the simple
to him method of tapping the thoughts of
the inventors and so relaying them through
his own mind to paper and then rushing to
the patents office with the result the extra-
sensitive method of telepathv he used was
a technique which he had discovered ciuite
accidentally many vears before and which
was the only original discovery he had made
too it was the onlv one that didnt find a
place in the files of the patents office and
that for obvious reasons

  so over the years with the more and
more acute development of his telepathic
mind-tapping technique he stole idea and
invention one after another until he was
among the wealthiest men alive and re-
nowned as the greatest inventor of all time
but now he slumped into his chair again
and concentrated on another man and in
a few seconds he was listening in on a con-
versation being carried on between the man
who had escaped from the patents office
and the man from whom he had stolen his
sketches

  emile audez has beaten me the
escapee was snarling fiercely as he began
ripping off a mask which had completely
transformed his face and now facing the
inventor of the space-ejector he growled
that swine has stolen our way to wealth
has stolen our means to power we must
call a meeting to-night to decide the fate
of audez how he does this i cannot tell
but it is plain enough that he does steal our

 inventions call a meeting for this evening
 at eight at the usual spot

   as you say nodded the inventor
 slowly but it seems impossible that audez
 could have stolen our invention perhaps
 

  perhaps what snapped the man
 angrily

   perhaps it is that emile audez is a
 genius perhaps it is that he has succeeded
 before us as with the other cases

   perhaps no such thing barked the other
 gent angrily no philosophy ever dreamed
 of could allow such a possible number of
 coincidences to be acts of nature this
 man is a thief but in what manner he
 steals  cannot tell

   then well discuss him when the council
 meets

   exactly

    that was all emile was interested in right
 then and he paced nervously up and down
 the room for a while and cursed himself
 for being such a fool as to line himself up
 against the fitstip squadron but there was
 nothing more now that he could do until
 the evening when the council of that under-
 cover organisation would meet then he
 would have to be alert and spying on them
 knowing all that was being planned

   but now after the savage demands he
 had been making on himself in his con-
 centrated mental activities emile was very
 tired and he went to his sleeping apartment
 and lay down turning on the soft arcs of
 the vitamin lamps and then relaxed and
 was soon asleep his sleep was heavy and
 restful under the gentle soothing influence
 of the lamps he slept soundly and long-
 too long

   when he woke it was with a start to
 realise that the lamps had automatically
 switched themselves off when they had re-
 stored him and that he had slept long past
 the appointed time for the meeting of the
 council of the fitstip squadron anxiously
  he glanced around but everything seemed
 to be in order then he hurried to his
 viewers and examined the surrounding air
  and countryside apart from a small object
 high up which he reasoned to be a bird
 he could see nothing and reassured he
 went back to his study and dialled through
 on -video and contacted the bureau of
 investigation to them he gave particulars
thought thief

that would enable them to wipe out the
ruthless organisation known as fitstip
squadron

  then more content he relaxed and
willed his mind to pick up the thoughts of
the inventor whom he had robbed he
realised with a sudden shudder of fear
that the council meeting was over already
and that the man was planning some attack
on the jet-rocket works of the government
it was a sabotage effort designed to reduce
the forces available to the government at
the time when fitstip attacked in their
attempt to overthrow the forces in power

  for a tedious hour he was forced to con-
centrate on these matters and then the
thoughts suddenly changed and the man
at the other end was thinking about emile
audez and a cry of horror escaped the lips
of the thought thief as he realised that this
was one time he wished he had not been
listening he picked up the thought-the
rocker-dematerialiser will not attack tor
twelve hours yet but by then we will be in
power in the land and may well find the
secret of this mans robberies before he
dies

  a shudder of horror ran through emile
audez he didnt need to be told what the
rocket-dematerialiser was during the last
war he had filed a patent on the device and
it had been the chief factor in finally bring-
ing his countrys enemies to their knees

  the small rocket-driven apparatus was
completely self-guided once it had been
given a target and no matter whether the
target was man machine or place the
rocket-dematerialiser would attack at the
appointed time and shatter the target into
nothingness immediately it released its
cosmic ray explosion

  god cried emile and it was a prayer
the fiends whats happened to the
bureau of investigation

  then flashing from the ether to his mind
came the panicked thoughts of the inventor
of the fitstip squadron

  police a raid ive got to escape
even if i alone escape therell still be a
chance tor the fitstip squadron to reform
suddenly with a slashing shock of pain
to emiles mind tuned as it was to that of
the other man all was blackness and audez
knew that the bureau of investigation were

carrying out a successful raid on the head-
quarters of the fitstip squadron

  eagerly he ran to the video and flicked
it on and after an interval of a few minutes
the programme was cut short and a flash
of news came from the government news
office

  an illegal organisation known as fitstip
squadron was raided in its headquarters a
few minutes ago the raid is still proceed-
ing with the casualties heavy on both sides
these traitors are extremely well armed and
are believed to have released some rocket-
dematerialisers any person having cause
to fear this organisation should take what-
ever precautions may seem best to him

  the video screen went blank then and
the original programme was revived within
a few seconds but by now emile audez
thought thief and wealthy and respected
man of his country was a fear-ridden mass
of trembling horror he went up to the
roof and climbed into his rocket-car his
huge cadaverous eyes peering into the sky
and struggling to convince himself that there
was nothing there that death in its horrible
form did not lurk above waiting the hour
at which to strike

  with a savage jerk of the controls audez
lunged his rocket-car high up into the night
sky and opened the throttle to full speed
which was round the fifteen hundred miles
per hour mark on this multi-purpose
machine then with fingers that trembled
audez reached back switched on the
infra-red viewers which scanned the skies
around the catapulting machine on the
screen was flashed an enlarged image of the
thing every deadly outline of its shape
was engraved on his memory and he plunged
his machine down from eighty thousand feet
into a spiralling dive from which he pulled
his rocket-car when only fifteen thousand
feet from the ground

  the merciless thing that followed him
dived more steeply than his car but within
a couple of minutes or so it was back on
his trail like the tail of a comet which could
never be lost already he was two hours
closer to his doom - ten hours remained
he plunged and roared his rocket-car
through every manoeuvre the atomic-
powered motors could take but that thing
stayed with him

  great beads of cold sweat gathered on
his brow and he turnedand began to flash

toward the object the silent rocket-con-
trolled mechanism which pursued him
waiting dutifully for the correct time to
strike but as he flashed toward the thing
it fled him and he could not get it
within the range of his deadly atom-shells

  three or four times he fired from the
stern atom-shell tubes but the shells always
exploded before they reached the thing
then with a wild curse he remembered that
the thing was protected by its own deflector
device which exploded any shells before
they could come within harms range

  a mine yelped emile suddenly thats
the answer ive got to go down deep under
the earth down where it cant follow me
where i can shut myself in

  laughing hilariously now in the sudden
relief as he believed he had the explanation
the thought thief dived his rocket-car down
from a hundred thousand feet to ten thou-
sand feet and then straightened out and
headed for the nearest mining district he
knew in the area

  once he was grounded he ran to the man-
agers office and explained his predicament
then flashing his authority he demanded
to be locked down a shaft of the mine-
deep down

  and under no circumstances must you
open the mine-not even should you believe
it is i who call you snapped audez

  as you say herr audez snapped the
manager

  quickly he conducted the man to the
top of a mine shaft and directed him into a
small elevator car then with shouted direc-
tions to his operators he watched the eleva-
tor sink and the door slowly close over be-
hind it in that instant just before the door
closed he had a sudden feeling that some-
thing had flashed before his eyes he could
not be sure

  below deep under the earth emile audez
was sitting still silent staring at the thing
which hovered in the air in the centre of
the mine shaft a tiny flame of the jet which
kept it air-borne through the sweat that
rolled unheeded over audezs eyes he stared
fixedly unblinking at the thing time passed
and he moved not till there remained but
three minutes to the set time

  only then with horrible screams rising
from his throat did emile audez thought
thief run panic-stricken from the thing
three minutes passed in an eternity of hor-
ror as the thing hovered always just by him
and then-the end
in one bound bright reached the door and with his back to it faced the villainous old
venusian    if you try to jet past me you will be blasted with a raygun he menaced

      millions of simple-minded venusians await the spark
      that will spread revolt through the planet
      rests with one man to try to turn the tide of unrest

revolt on venus

the door of welfare officer streeters
office slid open and a sodden wave of
the fierce venusian heat flowed into the air-
conditioned room its impact almost a tan-
gible thing and causing the two earthfnen
to gasp

  dr creel entered loosened his heat
resisting suit and gratefully took the ice-
celd drink proffered by young bright the
assistant welfare officer before attempt-
ing to speak

  things havent improved in the labor-
atories streeter said dr creel setting
down his glass theres something in the
air there and  dont like it

  no complaints from the venusian work-
ers doctor asked streeter frowning

  none whatever thats the whole
trouble the conditions in my laboratories

 by ace carter

making synthetic chlorophyll are better
than on the plantations and in the extrac-
tion factory but in spite of that the ven-
usians arent happy with me they say
nothing to me or to my overseer but they
gather in groups and mutter to one another
and there have been a few cases of sabo-
tage which have interfered with production
i cant understand it but im quite sure
that the venusian extraction corporation
is behind it

  i thought wed smashed that crowd
when we had ludd deported to earth
said streeter irritably it seems that
ludds partner mallar is just as big a
scoundrel
page 

thrills incorporated

  they have a lot to lose pointed out
dr creel before i began making syn-
thetic chlorophyll they had a monopoly
they owned the best land for growing the
green leaves from which the chlorophyll
was extracted and they have a first-class
factory for extraction purposes theres an
enormous amount of money lied up in the
enterprise and theyre not going to lose
it all without a fight and somehow theyve
managed to gel the venusians on their side
the venusians are your responsibility
streeter so its up to you to find out whats
brewing

  streeter eyed the scientist for a few
moments i suppose so he admitted at
length send sog over here doctor hes
regarded as the leader of the venusians
youll get nothing out of him objected
dr creel hes like all the rest of them
-dumb

  i think  may said streeter slowly
just send him over anyway by the way
he added as the doctor rose grunting irrit-
ably would it be possible to shift your
laboratories to earth

  of course not snorted dr creel to
do that id have to reproduce the atmos-
pheric conditions of venus and even then
id have to employ venusians earthmen
couldnt stand it

  well if you hear a rumor that you
are going to shift your laboratories to earth
please dont deny it

  but-

  thats all you have to do cut in
streeter keep quiet dont deny it and
dont confirm it now send sog over
unreasonable old devil said young
bright as dr creel left

  hes correct just the same said stree-
ter its our job to see that the natives are
contented if theres trouble and creel re-
ports it to the venus colonial office on
earth it might mean my recall and ive
spent too many years on this green hot-
house of a planet to go back to earth in a
subordinate job im going to get to the
bottom of this before it breaks and old sog
is going to help me

  streeter lapsed into thoughtful silence
ever since the atomic war on earth which
had rendered sterile vast areas of food-
producing country it had been of vital im-
portance to obtain supplies of the essential
green chlorophyll to infuse into artificial
food tabfels and the planet venus was rich

in that commodity the fast growing vivid
green vegetation yielded enormous quan-
tities of the chemical which was extracted
from the leaves harvested by the venusians
and as a result the venusian extraction
corporation had grown in wealth and
power but now thanks to dr creels suc-
cessful work it had been made possible to
reproduce artificially the chlorophyll from
a few simple chemicals peculiar to venus
there had been an attempt by the ex-
chairman of the company ludd to pre-
vent the doctor from setting up the labor-
atory but streeter had outwitted the villain-
ous plantation owner now it seemed
iudds associates were engaged on some
fresh villainy

  the door of the office slid open again
and sog the elderly venusian thudded in
on great splayed feet and waved a scaly
many-jointed arm in the traditional greeting

  sit sog invited streeter arc there
any complaints from your fellows in dr
creels laboratories

  none officer replied sog in the dia-
lect his lidless eyes under his flat reptilian
skull were narrowed as thcv gazed at the
welfare officer the old venusian posses-
sed more than the normal share of crafti-
ness which is often inherent in primitive
and simple peoples

  that is good sog murmured streeter
work there is better than work on the
plantations you know sog he went on
we have brought you many things from
earth you have bright lights in your homes
you have telephoto entertainment and you
have music you will lose these things if
your pepolc do not work fairly

  we know that officer assented sog

  and if your people do not want to work
for us they need not do so pursued stree-
ter dr creel thinks your fellows arc not
happy in the laboratories so he has decided
that soon he will not have a laboratorv on
this planet he has found a means of doing
the work on earth

  old sog half rose from his seat and for
a brief instant his eyes gleamed redly then
he was calm again at least outwardly

  if dr creel does that sog said
streeter there will be no work for your
people on the plantations either you do
not want to go back to the wretched con-
ditions in which we from the earth first
found you the venusian was silent and
streeter went on you will tell your people
revolt on venus

page 

this thing sog and now you may go

  no sooner had the venusian thudded
from the office than streeter tossed a pair
of elcctroculars to his assistant watch
which way he goes bright he snapped i
may be following him he got into his
heat-resisting suit as he spoke young bright
focused the electroculars through the win-
dow switched them on and pierced the
mists that continually blotted out the ven-
usian landscape and after watchine old sog
for some moments turned quickly to
streeter

  hes not going direct to the laborat-
ories he said hes making for venburs
city

  just as i expected commented streeter
that bit of false information ive just given
him has shocked him profoundly and un-
less im mistaken hell make straight for
mallar and blurt it out to him he fastened
on his suit ill take a pair of electroculars
to keep him in sight and also one of those
button-microphones

  he stepped out on to the soft yielding
ground making for the upper ground where
the earthmen had built the only city on
venus he had no difficulty in keeping old
sog in sight through the mist-piercing elec-
troculars and when the venusian reached
the wide street which contained the row of
cylindrical office buildings the commercial
centre of the little city he nodded with
satisfaction

  sog entered the venusian extraction
companys building and streeter followed
avoiding the main office and stepping on to
the slowly moving spiral way which took
him to the top floor where mallars private
office was situated the circular corridor
was temporarily deserted and streeter after
a quick look around pressed the suction cap
of the tiny microphonc against the plastic
door of mallars office inserted the button
receiver into his ear and switched on and
immediately the voice of mallar raised in
fury reached him

  youve got it wrong sog said mallars
voice he cant make the stuff on earth
 have said what he said came the slow
thick tones of the venusian

  if thats true said mallar fiercely it
means the end for us and it means the end
of your chance of becoming the lord of
your people sog

  streeter gasped those few  words ex-
plained a lot sog was the tool that mallar

was using he had promised the old ven-
usian the equivalent of a kingdom backed
by earthmen and no doubt a mass of lux-
uries and sog had influenced his people in
some way to support him

  there is nothing to be done said sog
bitterly

  theres a lot to be done and done
quickly rasped mallar the revolution
will occur now-this day and the first
thing to be done is to destroy those labor-
atories completely your fellows will cease
work within an hour sog you will return
now taking the ray-bomb with you and
conceal it in the laboratories it will be set
for one hour and ten minutes the explosion
will be the signal for your people to rise
against the other earthmen dr creel and
his staff and the security officers and above
all the two welfare officers but be sure
that dr creel does not escape he alone
can make the synthetic green liquid and
with him out of the way it will take a long
time for another to discover his process-
if it is ever discovered then there will be
prosperity for all on this planet and you
will be the ruler of a prosperous world

  it is good said sog my people-

  streeter whipped the suction cap from the
door and turned quickly as soft footsteps
sounded from the direction of the spiralway
approaching him was a big florid faced
man yeats who was mallars co-director
of the venusian extraction corporation

  mr streeter the plump face widened
into a ready smile yeatss habitual pose
was that of the breezy hail-fellow-well-met
business man and it was a pose that paid
dividends streeter however had never
been deceived by the veneer of good fellow-
ship and had no doubt that yeats was every
bit as ruthless and cunning as the other
director of the corporation i hope you
havent come to us with complaints from
the venusian workers

  no streeter reassured him eyeing the
fat man closely and wondering whether
that button-microphone had been observed
just a routine conference about conditions
generally mr yeats i was about to tap on
the door when you came along as he
spoke he rapped on mallars door and a
moment later it opened and mallar ap-
peared	

  mr streeter for a conference on the
venusian workers announced yeats fol-
lowing the welfare officer inside there
page 

thrills incorporated

was no sign of sog but a communicating
door to the next office explained the exit
of the old venusian

  mallar seated himself at the desk and
motioned to a chair opposite in which
streeter seated himself yeats however
walked straight to a cupboard opened the
door and when he turned he held in his
hand a ray pistol

  and now mr streeter he said still
smiling blandly perhaps you will tell us
without waste of time just why you were
so interested in my colleagues conversation
as to listen in on a button microphone
whats that mallar rose from his
chair he was tall dark and hatchet-faced
and his dark deep-set eyes glared down at
the welfare officer so youve been doing
some prying eh

  streeter acutely aware of the menace of
the ray gun which could silently blast him
to eternity did not move a muscle

  in my job it is sometimes necessary to
use unpleasant methods he replied 
have had complaints from some of your
plantation workers mallar i came to dis-
cuss the trouble with you and i thought 
might pick up some indication of your
policy by listening-

  dont bother with any more lies
streeter cut in mallar harshly you fol-
lowed sog i hope youve learnt enough to
know that youre finished on this planet
and so is creel and his precious synthetic
process

  you wont get away with it mallar
said streeter quitely you can finish me off
and creel too but the venus colonial of-
fice on earth will finish you and your cor-
poration

  on the contrary smiled yeats with a
meaning glance at his co-director tell
him mallar

  the colonial office said mallar re-
suming his seat will be with us one hun-
dred per cent we havent gone into this
thing blindly streeter were going to stage
a popular revolution the colonial officials
will believe that the venusians working for
dr creel have been discontented with their
conditions and that they have turned at last
goaded beyond endurance

  that is not true creel offers conditions
superior-

  what does that matter so long as the
colonial officers believe it to be true said
mallar we have convinced the simple

venusians that once the venusian extrac-
tion corporation has a monopoly the
golden age will begin for them they will
govern themselves under a benevolent king
who will be installed in a palace the
idea of a venusian king has excited
their simple imaginations given them
a mental lift that nothing else could
do they will have their own welfare offi-
cers and security officers venusians
trained by our corporation mallar smiled
thinly they may have to work a little
harder later on but by- that time there will
be two distinct classes of venusians-those
that work for us and those that work with
us the conscience of king sog the first
will be kept in control by the luxuries and
the apparent power he will possess

   streeters lips closed tightly the devilish
ingenuity of the plan was clear to him-
terribly clear it was the old diplomacy that
existed on earth in the twentieth century
puppet rulers who fired the bullets prepared
by the real rulers and the result would be
little better than abject slavery for the great
majority of the ignorant venusians the
worst feature of the whole thing was that
the venus colonial office whose chief job
was to maintain supplies of the precious
chlorophyll would in the extremity of the
situation assent to the plan once dr creels
laboratories were devastated and the doc-
tor murdered

  mallar pressed a button on his desk nnd
in response the communicating door opened
and sog re-entered the room mallar opened
a drawer and brought out a thin plastic cyl-
inder one end of which was a dial

  the ray bomb sog he said handing
it to the venusian who dropped it into the
tool wallet strapped around his waist you
know what to do with it dont allow any-
one else in the laboratory to set eyes on it
dr creel does not suspect anything but be
very careful none of the overseers must see
it or have any idea where you conceal it
in the laboratories you understand

  none will see it replied the venusian
positively

  very well you will now return to the
laboratories as the venusian thudded
softly from the room mallar gestured to
streeter youre coming with us

  the welfare officer rose and was escor-
ted to the rising spiralway up on to the roof
where several aircars were parked

  in you get commanded mallar open-
revolt on venus

ing the door of one of the cars

  whats the idea demanded streeier
coldly

  get in while youre alive snapped mal-
lar youre going for a little ride thats
all the mans tone and the soft fat laugh
from yeats revealed more than his actual
words streeter with a thrill of horror real-
ised just how the ride would end-his body
blasted by the ray gun dumped into one
of the myriad mist covered swamps that
covered the green planet

  he tensed his muscles to attempt any-
thing like an attack just then with yeats
holding the ray gun in readiness would be
tantamount to quick suicide the other alter-
native would be little better but it would
be a chance a faint chance a million-to-
one chance perhaps-but worth taking

  he shrugged in apparent resignation
and bent to enter the aircar his eyes were
on the control board of the craft he gauged
the distance to the main releasing lever
and then with a suddenness which com-
pletely staggered the two men he dived
headfirst into the craft and pulled down
hard on the control lever

  the craft shot upwards but before it had
lifted twenty feet its interior was filled with
a scaring bluish flame as yeats discharged
his ray gun a circular hole appeared in
the metal body and the machine lurched
wildly

  he turned to the visiphone pressed the
code for the welfare office and to his un-
utterable relief the screen glowed at least
that was in order and if young bright was
still in the office    and he was the face
of his young assistant appeared on the
screen

  sog shouted streeter catch him
bright hes gone back with a ray bomb to
plant in the laboratories

  as he spoke he felt a violent movement
of the craft and through the window he

could see the misty clouds apparently rising
and that meant that the crippled craft was
rushing to the ground he groped for the
repulsion control and pulled it hard over
and there seemed to be a slight diminution
in his downward rush he could hear young
brights voice but the image had faded on
the screen and the sharp cracklc of fire
under the control panel told him why sweat
poured from streeters face as he tugged
madly at the repulsion control as he en-
deavoured desperately to lessen the impact
of the inevitable crash his last thought
as the machine hurtled towards the ground
was a wild speculation as to whether his
message had got over to young bright   

  from the roof mallar and yeats had a
glimpse of the lurching aircar and saw the
sheet of flame from the blasted jet and
then the fog intervened

  he wont get far said yeats thats
the finish of him

  mallar who had been staring in the
direction taken by the aircar suddenly
swung round with a curse the visiphone
he said he could have contacted his
assistant or the security office

  he wouldnt have time began yeats
what do we do snarled mallar
stand here and hope he didnt have time
we cant take a risk on this he ran across
the roof to one of the other aircars were
going to dr creels laboratories if sog
is intercepted by bright or a security
officer well come out in the open youve
got your raygun if you use it properly
therell be no witnesses when you blast the
security officer or bright into flame

	 

  streeters doubts as to whether young
bright had received his frantic message were
ill-founded for not only had the young
officer received the message but had acted
swiftly dr creels laboratories were only
a few hundred yards from the welfare
office and without waiting even to don his
heat-resisting suit bright dashed from the
office and ran over the spongy ground
towards the big building which shortly
loomed up through the mists as he
struggled with lessening energy towards the
entrance a figure appeared dimly moving
with the characteristic thudding speed of a
venusian and made for the door

  sog brights voice roared at the
venusian who immediately stopped in-
page 

thrills incorporated

stinctiveiy obeying the voice of an earth-
man the old venusians eyes were nar-
rowed in surprise as bright reached him
you will come with me sog panted
bright

  i return to my work replied sog mov-
ing to the door

  with one bound bright reached the door
and stood his back to it facing the villain-
ous old venusian you will not enter until
 know what is in your wallet if you try
to get past me i shall call the overseer and
you will be blasted with a raygun

  i have nothing in my wallet officer
protested sog his reptilian eyes glaring
redly at the earthman

 you will be searched sog said bright
i know you have a raybomb but if you
hand it to me you will not be punished
only the earthmen you are working for
will suffer

  sog made no reply instead he backed
away and was lost to view leaving bright
racked by indecision if he followed the
venusian he could not warn dr creel if
he went inside and lost touch with sog the
old venusian could conceal the ray bomb
somewhere in the vicinity and even if the
explosion occurred outside the laboratories
sufficient damage would be done to cripple
the activities of the plant and that would
mean swift retaliatory action from the
venus colonial office against streeter and
himself

 young bright made his decision he
would keep the venusian in sight if pos-
sible and try to reason with him or to get
that fatal raybomb from him he plunged
forward into the shifting mists and was re-
warded by the sight of sogs dim figure
making for the rear of the building again
he roared after the venusian and sog
swerved away from the building

  it was then that bright heard the hissing
of an aircar and a moment later the car
landed he ran forward at least the
occupants would be earthmen and they
would join in the chase of the venusian
but as he came close to the aircar the door
opened and mallar emerged

  its bright shouted mallar quick
yeats-the raygun

  it was sufficient warning for the young
welfare officer he turned and ran back
to the building there was nothing else for
it now but to get help from inside and

hope that sog could be caught later a
sheet of flame dispelled the mists to his
right and the reflected heat from the blast
from the raygun scorched his cheek he
could hear the pursuing footsteps of the
two men and another blast directly oyer
his head almost blinded him and caused him
to drop to the spongy ground he was up
again in an instant and reached and fell
through the doorway

  doctor he roared frantically stumbling
towards the gasket fitted door of the office
he reached the door and cannoned into it
but before he could grasp the handle mallar
had pounced on him and he was borne to
the floor

  quick yeats snarled mallar finish
him off theres no one else here by the
look of it streeter told only him

  get him outside first said yeats i
cant get him without burning you drag
him out

  bright his body almost drained of energy
through exposure to the venusian atmos-
phere without a heat-resisting suit struggled
feebly as he felt himself being dragged
across the smooth floor by the wiry mallar
and then through the pounding in his ear-
drums he heard the welcome voice of dr
creel who had opened the office door in
response to the thud of his body against it

  what the- began dr creel mallar
the doctors voice rose to a shout and
instantly a blast from yeats raygun sent
a bolt ol tire towards the doorway

  missed growled yeats as the sheet of
flame spread and flattened across the wall
scorching deeply into the tough material
but he wont come out again in a hurry

  go after him-finish him snarled mal-
lar hell give the alarm

  yeats moved towards the office-and it
was the last move he ever made before
the shocked eyes of bright and mallar the
muzzle of a ray gun sneaked out from the
office and the next instant yeats without
so much as a moan was enveloped in a
burst of white-hot fire and reduced to a
hot liquid mass of red pulp and blackened
rags mallar uttered a gasp and releasing
the young officer raced from the building

  au right doctor bright struggled to
his feet and dr creel cautiously emerged
from the office still holding the smoking ray
gun mallars gone weve got to catch
revolt on venus

him to find out when the ray bomb is timed
to explode

  ray bomb dr creels face paled
sog has it he is to plant it in ihc labor-
atories

  dr ceel uttered a cry of alarm niccd to
the door bright moving more slowly
reached the open door and stood there
panting and peering through the mists and
presently dr creels shadowy figure camc
into view hes gone he said got away
in his aircar

  as he spoke the speaking-clock in the
office called the lime fourteen hours
which was the hour for the venusian work-
ers to cease duty bright gasped the doc-
tors arm quick get into the office call
the overseers and tell them not to allow any
of the venusians to leave once they start
to come out well never find sog hell
mingle with them and perhaps sneak inside
with the bomb

  dr creel nodded and ran into the office
bright heard him rapping out orders and
then a figure appeared in the front door-
way which made him stare

  sog he gasped

  the old venusian calmly thudded
through the doorway his reptilian eyes glit-
tering in apparent triumph

  where is that ray bomb demanded
bright

  there is nothing in my wallet officer
said the venusian i know nothing of
bombs he opened his wallet and revealed
its emptiness

  in here commanded bright escorting
the venusian into the office now he
said inside dr creel and  know that
you had instructipns to conceal it in the
building if you tell us the truth you have
nothing to fear mallar can do nothing for
you now for soon the security officers will
take him back to earth

  the old venusian glared at the earth-
man then he bent his head if that is so
i have failed he muttered abjectly he
was to make me king of my people

  so thats it said dr creel well if
your people want a king they can have one
there wont be any difficulty about that
sog now where is the ray bomb

  i was instructed to allow no eyes to see
it muttered sog i was to hide it in here
where it would explode ten minutes after
my people left the blasting of the build-

ing would be the sign for my people to

revolt

  ten minutes cried bright its almost
that now-and your people are still in the
building where it is

  knowing i would be searched i con-
cealed it outside replied the venusian
then while my people were all leaving the
building i hoped to bring it back inside
concealing myself among them as they all
come out together it was my own plan
added the simple minded venusian with
naive pride

  bright fought for self-control dont you
realise that if it explodes in the vicinity at
all it will do great damage where is it
now-quickly

  that is so admitted the venusian
after pondering a moment i will take you
io it but he stipulated his lidless eyes
gleaming i shall still be king of my
people

  you will shouted bright if were
still alive in the next few minutes

  sog turned quickly and thudded outside
followed by the two earthmen the venus-
ian ran into the mists stopped uncertainly
and began moving in apparently aimless
circles and at last he stopped his scaly
face wrinkled in perplexity

   it-it is gone officer he said

  gone but where-who-

  bright stopped and turned as from the
direction of the city a white glow cut
through the mists followed by a devastating
explosion great heavens he gasped

  i concealed it in your aircar began
sog to the doctor-
my aircar repeated dr creel it was
mallars aircar and hes taken it away
saved my laboratories and blasted himself
and his own aircar into nothingness

	 

  ill never curse these venusian swamps
again it was welfare officer streeter who
spoke addressing his assistant the aircar
 was in was crippled with only one repul-
sion jet functioning i thought it was all
up with me but the swamp acted as a
cushion it sucked the machine down but
i managed to clamber out on top and leap
to solid around so it was a happy landing
for me after ali if a messy one

  and a happy ending said bright to
the first threatened revolt on venus
for some time now i have been
spiralling through the skies over
your earth    from the prob-
ings of my idea-transference ap-
paratus i have heard my ship

deport to general werner on guided

 degrees 

   i cant think straight these ideas that
keep coming    theyre fantastic unbe-
lievable i cant resist them its like trying
to escape from something when i try and
fight them its hopeless  nothing i can
do but write them down

   theyre beginning again-from the be-
ginning-all impelling beyond resistance

times

ill let my mind follow where they lead
the struggle to resist them in the pretence
of this small missile is too great ill write
them down as they come-they seem to
transpose themselves into words as they
flash through my mind

  space station spertiz was quiet the morn-
ing we walked out to the rocket take-off
platforms the flight of nine ships was
ready for the commencement of the journey
nine carefully trained pilots were ready
at the assembly line i am flight com-
when flight commander michael forbes boosted his
rockets to travel faster than light he found that time
too had a speed   and that he had placed himself be-
yond its barrier-into its power  

mander and i issued final instruction to my
men

  you all have your orders keep in con-
stant contact with me remember were
not yet sure what will happen us as we ap-
proach the speed of light theory is some-
times a long way from practice all right
boys into your ships and well take off
zero hour plus five minutes time now-
 check

  check they replied one after another
as they set their watches

  nine gleaming shapes set there for the
most dramatic flight in the history of inter-
stellar achievement the attempt to reach
hecton-the recently discovered planet be-
yond the orbit of pluto

 a ccelerate i ordered my flight

       helium-decomposition tubes roared
in the soundless void of space as we moved
out up and up crept the speed toward the
dangerous level-toward the point where
none knew what would be the result none
knew whether we would be able to assault
that last great bastion of speed-the barrier
flung up as we approached the speed of
light

  you will understand when i say it was
for us like your own assault on the bar-
rier-the speed of sound not long before
this time-far back in the ancient historical

past of my day-you solved that problem
and we faced an even greater unknown
that last barrier to all the hopes of the
scientific world

  then it happened i felt my ship sud-
denly caught-gripped as if by some giant
hand-some strange force that was beyond
the power of the rocket tubes to defeat i
tried to flash a message to my flight but
there was no communication i tried to see
beyond the sight viewers in the wall of my
cabin but there was nothing but void noth-

ing but the blackness of an impenetrable
night

  imagine night in space where there
should be neither day nor night a force
greater than that of my helium-decomposi-
tion tubes in free space where there should
be no force no power other than the accel-
erating might of the mighty tubes blazing
behind the ship

  every effort i made to gain control of the
ship failed i was fatigued weary almost
to the point of unconsciousness my stom-
ach revolted horribly as if i were caught in
some swirling current of nothingness as
if i were caught in a maelstrom-a vortex
of whirling nothingness

  for what seemed hours then but which
i now know were but minutes i seemed to
be swirling through that void twisting and
whirling within my great ship spinning and
circling through the spirals of blackness
circling like a cork caught in the central
spiral of space where water spins and spirals
its way down a drain-a plug-hole

t knew of nothing which could explain

  this thing in all the scientific knowledge
i had accumulated through years of con-
stant learning under the methods of the
knowledge rays i could recall no single fact
which would hint at the explanation of what
i was experiencing my mind reeled under
the impact of this new series of events only

too well did i realise that this must be the
answer to the problem of approaching the
speed of light

  but no solution could be coming from
the void without then slowly it seemed
that my ship was moving less quickly it
seemed that all was becoming calmer my
thoughts became calmer my mind more
alert to what was happening it was even
as a cork slowly coming to a stop-a pause
in its swirling through the fury of a mael-
strom

  down below through the telescqplj
page 

thrills incorporated

viewer i could see the outlines of a
continent and i was spiralling down slowly
toward it though the rocker tubes roared
still their power was as nothing against thai
which swirled me relentlessly downward

  fear caught at me and i knew that i musi
crash death waited on me down there
with every piece of skill i had acquired 
fought to keep my ship from coming lower
nothing i did seemed to change my course
at all my ship was completely out of my
control

  not till then did  realise know for the
first time that  was trapped in the mael-
strom of time itself in what had been but
minutes according to the clock on the dial
before me i knew i had been flung back
through a period in time longer than the
history of my age could remember a time
when men moved about the earth on the
backs of strange animals called horses
weird creatures that must have become ex-
tinct long before my time

  using the idea-transference prober 
focused on the mind of such a human and
learned that he called his time the veai
eleven hundred and sixty-five the island
on which he moved he called britain men
fought with knives longer than their arms
and fired shafts of wood from primitive
things called bows and it took a whole day
for athousand men to kill five hundred
others in my age a million men could be
wiped out in a second with a single blast
from a helium-decomposer unit

then even as a cork moves in a vorlex
of water i was suddenly swept on
again whisked away through time in that
horrifying void through which even con-
sciousness failed as the swirling motion ol
the ship brought hammering pain to my ears
and then the blessing of unconsciousness
through what spirals and anti-spirals of
time i passed during that period i have no
knowledge there is no record to tell me
where-or at least when i had been

  only when i slowed again could  know
that i was in another age another place and
immediately i knew i was looking down on
my own land-ameriski the time was
much closer to my own age and by focusins
my idea-transference prober i could realise
consternation caused to those on the ground
by the strange appearance of my ship in the
heavens above the land scout planes came
up and circled my craft as itrushed across
the sky rocket-tubes still blazing uselessly

as the force of time had its own way with
my ship

  an eerie feeling of hopelessness came
over me as  contacted the thoughts of these
lighting men they thought me some in-
vader from another planet and i could have
told them that the peoples of mars and
venus-the only two planets with life-
were far backward of their age and nowhere
near the stage of scientific achievement
when they could have sent rocket ships to
earth

  i pressed that button and one after an-
other the decomposer jets blasted from their
port-holes in the wings of my ships and
one after another too the raiders suddenly
shattered in thousands of pieces and then
vanished in to the air as the decomposer
blast disintegrated them one after another
they vanished into nothingness other ships
came up and suffered a like fate there was
nothing i could do but defend my ship i
had to make every effort to return to my
base and report this experience to my
superiors the knowledge gained would be
invaluable in the planning of future speed
rights aiming for hecton

  again came the sickening shock as the
might of the maelstrom swept me through
its giddy twirling and consciousness again
left me i was hurtled off through time again
-flashing through eons of time in seconds
spinning and twisting my way round that
inescapable pattern of ages made by the
time maelstrom in which i had been trapped
by accelerating too quickly as i approached
the speed of light

ttovv i wish  could end it all this fear-
ful nightmare journey on which  am
bound rushing up and down through time
without the power to stay or depart de-
pending on the whimsy of this force which
controls the movement of the ship no pat-
tern of reason is involved in the wild gyra-
tions through which i move no sane mind
can follow the sweep of times through which
i pass

  and only when  reach a point where
the speed of the flight is slowed down to
sane limits do  know where  am for
some time now  have been spiralling
through the skies over your earth at a year
you call nineteen hundred and fifty from
the probings of my idea - transference
apparatus i have heard my ship called a
flying saucer too i have heard men
in their minds deny the existence of my ship
times maelstrom

page 

 and smile to myself when  know how neai
 the truth they are but which of them
 would believe me if they knew the truth

   who would admit in a time so primi-
 tive as yours that a man could travel
 through eons of time in a few hours who
 among you will admit that i am come out of
 your remote future and am staring down
 on you through instruments your greatesi
 brains would find too complex of concept
 to understand there arc none

   at last however i see a possibility ol
 getting some message of my plight through
 this barrier of time which separates us 
 from the side of my ship i am blasting out
 a shell which will contain an automatic
 idea-transference apparatus of the portable
 type it will have a complete record of my
 flight from the tinje i took the air heading
 for hecton at the lead of a flight of space
 ships if it should land safely in your time
  it will commence sending out the idea pat-
 terns when approachcd by a human it will
 continue to do so for four weeks if it es-
 capes out of this maelstrom in which i and
 my ship are caught

   only the thought that this is possible
 gives me interest-hope i reason that the
 initial blast force shooting the missile out
 from the ship will have to exceed the speed
 of light otherwise there will be no escape
 for it otherwise it would be trapped even
 as i and my ship are trapped

   at such a speed it will circle the earth
  many times before it eventually slows suf-
 ficiently to make a landing if my calcula-
 tions are correct it will land exactly on the
 spot over which i release it if i give it an
 initial velocity  times the speed of
 light

 there is nothing more i can add now
 to this already  can feel the power of
 the time-maelstrom snatching off my ship
 and soon i will be heading into what future
 or past times i cannot know the choice
 is not mine-but the maelstrom which has
 trapped me there isnothing i can do but
 wait and watch at some time i may be
 flung back into my own age or i may be
 carried back through time to the beginnings
 of all when the earth was nothing more
 than a molten mass flung off from the sun

   already i have been trapped for two
 weeks my supplies are running low and
 my body and mind fatigued to the point of
 breakdown there is no time left i must
 release this shell release point will be   

  thats all my mind is clear and free
again lord what have i been writing here
something about a space ship caught in a
maelstrom of time its impossible fantastic
ive got to write a report but how can
i  know nothing about this shell i can
find nothing about it except that it is of a
strange hard mineral unknown to us

  it appears to be solid and yet is light
as if the inside were hollowed out for the
extreme density of the material suggests a
great mass wonder is there anything to
that story cant explain how i came to
write it out otherwise im not gifted at im-
agining such nonsense

  but now i cant think straight again
rhose ideas that keep coming    ive got
to get out of here-away from that fool
contraption theyve brought me it too is
involving me in a repeating cycle of its
ideas i cant seem to escape them    but
now  cant think straight again those ideas
keep coming    ive got to get out of here
-away from that fool contraption theyve
brought me    it too seems to be involv-
ing me in a repeating cycle of ideas i cant
cscape them   

  station spertiz was quiet the morning
we walked out to the take-off platforms

- its starting again  cant stop it

-the flight of nine ships were ready for
the commencement of the journey  i
must stop it or i too will be like him-
spinning through time somewhere right now
swirling in and out of those voids pausing
like a cork in a whirlpool looking out from
his ship on an alien time and then being
whisked away again only to be flung up
into an eddy and left to gaze out again for
a short while its horrible trapped in time

at last they had achieved their dream - they had made
the perfect man - but they forgot to give him a mind
to match his perfect body 

professor linitz walked to the
windowed wall of the huge room and
gazed out over the city of more than one
million people his short stature was not
unusual for his time nor his large head
which was completely devoid of hair
behind thick-lensed glasses his eyes glinted
happily long fingers on his hands twined
into each other as he looked out over the
sign of peace and completion for many
generations aztecasia centre of the earths
civilization had led the world in the peace-
ful way taught by the great one long ago
after the devastating wars

  empadre-father of peace-had given
his doctrines to the peoples of the world
and linitz sighed with contentment as he
looked on his happy city a place of magni-
ficent buildings towering into the air many-
tiered streets carrying their happy throngs

a ron conway
inter-planetory novel

about their business with the street cars
radio-electrically driven gliding their leis-
urely way along their routes of progress

  but there was more than this vista of a
crimeless land to please the professor this
day to-day was to mark the final achieve-
ment of a venture commenced more than
six generations before when a small group
of peaceful aztecasian scientists had
gathered together to discuss mans evolu-
tionary trend toward physical weakness

  from the remote past there were records
of men vastly different from the short bald-
headed big craniumed males of the age
there was evidence showing that man had
once- been very similar to woman-even
taller than her on the average now women
were much as ever slightly taller and
broader of hip making the bearing of the
big-headed male children possible but be-
yond that they had changed little through
the ages from the remote times when the
world was first split asunder by global wars

    meanwhile the men devoting themselves
  more and more to intellectual activities and
  performing less and less physically arduous
  labor as automatic machinery took over al-
  most the whole of the necessary productive
  functions men had become shorter bigger-
  headed larger eyed and more unbecomingly
  unlike their women than ever

    now this day the final fruits of a plan
  made more than six generations ago was to
  be released to the world alcan lawrence
  a magnificent achievement of back-breeding
  to an original type was trained and ready
  for his part in the future of the land to
  linitz it was a tremendous thrill to know
  that for twenty years he had aided and
  planned for this day a man very like those
  of the first global wars period had been bred
  after six generations of careful scientific

  selection of partners for the all-important
  task

    alcan lawrence was to restore to the
  future males bom in aztecasia the beauty
  and symmetry of form he now possessed
  new possibilities of physical achievement
  in dancing and singing seemed certain and
  even the utopian future of the land looked
  forward to a time when it would be even
  brighter happier alcan lawrence had
  been bred and trained for his place in the
  life and destiny of the city and the people
  of aztecasia but destiny sometimes errs

    linitz moved over to the wall and pressed
  a button and relaxed on a sumptuous divan
  which was but one of many around the
  heavily carpeted and simply but luxuriously
  furnished room from the walls and the
  ceiling glowed the pleasantly soft lighting
  which seemed to come from everywhere
  and nowhere inside the temperature was
  pleasantly cool and the heat of the tropical
  sun failed to penetrate the windows of the

crimeless
futuristic cover-story

they were more than  feet up the
terrace and still nothing had happened
to prevent the stranger from accom-
plishing his purpose   

land

room which was more than twenty floors
above the ground below

  after a couple of minutes another man
entered the room he was slightly taller
than linitz and with a fringe of hair around
the bald dome of his head he was younger
-perhaps forty-and while his body and
head followed the same lines as those of
linitz they were not as exaggerated he
seemed more normal as compared with the
man who stepped through the door behind
him

  come in professor empeer called
linitz jovially in high good spirits and
you lawrence come in

  these last words were addressed to alcan
lawrence the product of more than six
generations of careful scientific back-breed-
ing to obtain an original type comparing
with the men of the first global wars era
linitz was well pleased with the five-feet-
ten of corded muscle and well-balanced

body he saw the heavy-browed primitive
face and the great mop of dark hair cover-
ing his head were all signs of the type they
had planned for so carefully scientific
upbringing had seen to it that the man
would be in perfect physical condition not
an hour of sickness had ever plagued alcan
in his twenty-three years

  why am i brought here alcan asked
quietly i prefer to remain out of doors
and to read in my private garden

  alcan my boy linitz said softly hi
voice husky with emotion you have long
known why we have not allowed you
abroad in the world you have long known
your destiny to-day is the climax of all
that was planned you are free to go out
into the city and live as others do your
present quarters and garden are yours by
right but the gates will no longer be locked
and guarded nor will i have any further
control over your destiny it now remains
to you to follow the paths your life must
lead and the benefit to the people of aztec-
asia will come through many generations to
bless you

  when he had finished this long speech
page 

thrills incorporated

the man alcan lawrence smiled a slow
smile of satisfaction

  freedom he murmured softly to him-
self the dream i have lived all my life
to go out into the city and to live as others
do to meet and laugh with them as i
have read of them and seen them on the
video screens freedom

  a great day for aztecasia chimed in
professor einpeer slowly all these
generations of secret work by many men
and now into the happiness of the people
will come another joy the hope and
knowledge that men can return to the form
and stature enjoyed by their women the
curse of intellectual evolution will fade
out

  free may i leave immediately
queried alcan unused to the thought of
being able to do as he wished

  immediately nodded linitz stepping
across to shake the hand of the man who
stood more than head and shoulders above
him and whose head seemed ridiculously
small by comparison with his own-much
like a womans good-luck

  thanks alcan replied simply

  he turned immediately to empeer and
shook his hand then face eager he
wheeled from the room and stood im-
patiently before the lift entrance the door
opened and he stepped into the lift and
was whisked down smoothly to the ground
floor

  every nerve in his body tensed as he
stepped from the jift and into the lobby
which opened through doors into the street
once out into the thoroughfare he moved
toward a stationary street-car and boarded
it his face was beaming with a smile that
was persuasive eagerly inviting others to
reet and congratulate him on the fact that
e was finally through his schooling for his
destiny in aztecasia

  but slowly as he looked around him the
smile faded from his face and his eyes
narrowed angrily as he saw the curious
open-eyed disbelief with which the men
stared at him they couldnt believe their
eyes they didnt believe that such a freak-
ish male could exist surely they would
have heard about it before all this and
more was written deeply in their eyes and
on their faces as they stared at alcan

  whats wrong with me he asked
fiercely

  not a man spoke the street-car pulled
smoothly to a halt and several of the men
nearest to alcan lawrence got up and left
the car alcan rose and made toward the
door his face wrinkled in fierce lines of
misunderstanding a little big-headed
man cowered back away from him as he
stepped from the car

  come here pleaded the bewildered
lawrencc slowly what have i done
that you slink away

  the little fellow stuttered out the one
word-freak-and then hurried away
in consternated horror alcan stood and
watched him go with a hopeless expression
of something akin to fear showing in his
brown eyes for a long while he stood
there seeing nothing and then slowly he
began to wander toward the park he could
see less than a block away down the
thoroughfare there at least among the
trees and rich tropical flowers he felt he
would be at home there he would find
friends find peace and happiness and then
very soon he would know all the joys of
the laughing dancing festivals which were
held in the open-air temples of empadre
father of peace

  thoughts such as these raced through his
mind as he moved toward the park no
sign of police or any official agent could
be seen for aztecasia along with all other
lands of the world where the doctrines of
empadre were followed did not need any
police or law enforcing agencies or an
army all these things were of the remote
historical past this was a crimcless land

  into the park with its magnificent rows
of gardens flowering into tropical splendour
the young man moved

  immediately after alcan had left the
professors room linitz had reached across
and pressed a button on the wall and a few
seconds after a little bow-legged man had
entered the room he was even shorter
than linitz and somewhat fatter big-
headed bald black staring eyes and a wide
twisted mouth there was something sly
about the way he moved across the room
to linitz

  sinlet snapped linitz swiftly follow
alcan lawrence and note all his move-
ments and his contacts with people never
let him from your sight he mustnt kndw
you follow
crimeless land

co for days after that sinlet fontaine
 obedient servant of professor linitz
trailed the man alcan lawrence on his
every venture from the garden and apart-
ments where he lived on all these ven-
tures alcan had more than a suspicion that
he was being followed it was almost as
if his shadow itself had detached itself from
him and was flitting along his path in the
rear

  so a nervous tension began working up
in lawrence a dull suspicion that all was
not as it should be this brought a ner-
vous tenseness to his movements and a
furtive checking of his rear every once in a
while and though he appeared in public
many times it seemed that there was none
who could resist staring a him

  meanwhile solitary alcan lawrence sat
on a quiet seat in the park close by his
quarters and his eyes were wistful as he
thought of the destiny he had been taught
from his youngest days was to be his when
he went out into the world he dreamed
of this time and now with his freedom
hanging like a great weight over his mind
alcan glowered into the stillness of the
coming evening

  theyve had lime he growled angrily
plenty of time why cant they accepi
me as one of them im not so different
their ancestors were like me-a long while
ago why have i to wait with the coming
festival season several females should be
choosing me for their mate instead-i sit
here the children run and scream men
stare and shrink away when i approach no
man or woman touches me-even in the
crowds

   hello a voice said quietly close by his
side

  the shock of hearing someone address
him spun him around suddenly and the girl
gave a start jumping to her feet from where
she had sat on the seat at his side-less
than a foot from him

   dont be afraid he pleaded desperately
fear nothing sit down again i must
talk with you

  quietly the girl sat down she edged
gingerly a little closer to him every nerve
in her body tensed for instant flight he
spoke softly to her and asked quietly
why do the people fear me why do
they not talk to me

   you are a freak she whispered softly
her voice awed no other man we have
known has been like you you have the
stature of a woman with the powers of a
man such strangeness is frightening
theres nothing to fear whispered
alcan quietly whats your name girl
gwenetz aldoon came the soft reply
as tall as alcan blonde smiling slightly
now the girl looked into the mans face for
the first time and he knew the strange
attraction of her large grey eyes her broad
hips held a special charm for him beneath
their short tunic of clinging material of a
lustrous color

  i am alcan lawrence he replied
quietly i think much about the coming
festival

   i also replied the girl quietly

  many times have i seen the gaiety
singing and dancing of the festival on the
video screens when all aztecasia gathers
at the great outdoor temple of empadre
since  was but a boy i have yearned to be
among those chosen by the women of the
city as a mate for the following months
many times have i dreamed of walking the
long arched terrace with its marble pillars
and its inlay of gold and precious stones
the triumphant march of mateship is still
but a dream to me whispered alcan pas-
sionately all his years of solitude falling
away now as his mind readied out toward
ihe seeming friendship offered

   the girl shivered at the thought of walk-
ing with this queer freak-her mind shrunk
away from it and turned quickly to grasp
at the assurance that she would walk down
the terrace with professor empeer at her
side the shiver didnt escape the alert
senses of the man and he interpreted them
aright

  you tremble he snapped angrily if
you fear me like the others why did you
come here why did you talk to me
no no gwenetz mumbled quickly

thrills incorporated

its not that its the sudden coolness of
the evening air she lied clumsily

  how could she tell him of her promise
to empeer to try and introduce this strange
male to her friends-to get to know him
and to try and help him set foot in the paths
of his planned future she knew im-
mediately that she could not she knew
too that her lie had not convinced him she
determined not to fail empeer so she
reached out a hand slowly and laid it on
his arm and a tremble of emotion flooded
through her at first it was not unlike fear
but then she knew that it was more-much
more

  see she trembled the word out i
d not fear you 

  a twig snapped in the bushes just back
of them and alcan lawrence whirled round
suspiciously his nerves were drawn tight
to breaking point by the continual feeling of
ever-watching eyes and now he startled to
his feet and ran to investigate calling

   stay there dont leave wait for me
then he was leaping across a narrow
border of flowers and racing from the
shrubs toward the spot where he could hear
the sounds of someone retreating hastily
through the jungle growth past the sign
which plainly warned it is dangerous for
aztecasians to enter this botanical jungle
like the man he pursued alcan took no
heed of the sign and crashed his way from
the garden parts of the park into the dense
jungle growths his heavy-browed primi-
tive face was twisted in determination and
the sreat muscles along his shoulders were
corded with exertion as he forced his way
deeper into the jungle area from whence
he could hear the man still fleeing

   five minutes and his prey was only just
ahead of him a terrified scream shrilled
through the jungle from just ahead the
sound high-pitched and hysterical pierced
through alcans brain like the wound of a
knife

  help came a more normal voice a
moment later the tiger tree has caught
me

  the man was trapped and thinking of
nothing but his life as he called on the man
who followed him in that desperate
moment he forgot all his fear and hatred
of the freak alcan whom he was paid to
watch only the desire to go on living
reigned in his mind aztecasian men un-

used to great physical exertion or violence
of any sort lived a peaceful life and died
of old age when well beyond the age of a
hundred and twenty years there was no
need in their lives to cultivate bravery and
this man revealed none now

   when lawrence had finally forced his
 way into the clearance where the tiger tree
 reigned supreme the black eyes of the man
 were staring wildly and his wide twisted
 mouth was hanging open loosely his teeth
 chattering together in his fear he was
 trapped by the tough curling tentacle which
 had whipped out from one of the huge red
 flowers and snared him

   stop still commanded lawrence
 issuing the first command he had ever made
 as if it were the most natural thing in the
 world

   he had studied tiger trees in his botany
 course and knew that the predatory plant
 needed a great traffic of ants through the
 huge scentless flowers to transfer the pollen
 and fertilize the seeds nature by fitting the
 flowers with their own snares for trapping
 animals birds and any other close ven-
 turer had ensured that the fertilization
 would take place when the ants swarmed
 over the flowers to reach the trapped haul
 of meat

   get me loose cried sinlet eontaine
 bleatingly get me free before the ants
 come

   from that moment there was no thought
 of his original purpose but only of rescuing
 the big-headed bow-legged male from the
 clutching tentacle of the tiger tree he
 moved in cautiously watching the swinging
 tentacle from the only other huge red
 flower when it lashed oqt to snare him
 as he came within range alcan lawrence
 hurled himself down suddenly hitting the
 moist earth hard and then flashing a hand
 up to catch the trailing end of the tentacle
 as it curled back toward the flower for
 another strike

   his hand caught a hold on the sinuous
  end of the tentacle and he was immediately
 involved in a weird struggle with the lash-
 ing twisting thing that struggled to free
 itself and ensnare the man with breath
 panting from his lungs alcan hung on
 grimly as he was thrown bodily from side
 to side by the lashing strength of the tiger
 tree
crimeless land

 tack on the seat where alcan had left
 her gwenetz aldoon sat still for a
 moment trying to analyse the sudden
 sweeps of emotion that had raced through
 her when she touched the strange male
 she could think of nothing before that had
 come close to being as this nor could
 she be sure whether it was pleasant or not

   fearing his return within seconds the
 girl got up and ran down the long path that
  led her toward the street and the sanity ol
 the mingling groups of her fellow aztec-
 asians there she saw the normal men-
 the short huge-headed males who were
 mostly bald and who showed no sign o
 hair on their faces these weak dark-
 skinned men made her feel relaxed and
 comfortable and a faint shudder ran through
 her as she thought again of the strange one
 alcan lawrence

   lashing and switching furiously the
 tiger trees tentacle fought to free itself
 from the thing that clung tenaciously to its
 end but with minutes slowly creeping by
 lawrence hung grimly to it knowing that
 the stores of energy that could be supplied
 to the tentacle quickly would soon be
 exhausted and then the vicious snare of
 the tree would be useless for a time-
 enough time for him to find a way of freeing
 sinlet fontaine

   that man was cringing and crying in the
 snare of supple plant-life as he rocked back
 and forth near the great red flower of the
 tree already down below near the base
 of the tree sinlet could see the ants forming
 ranks to move up the trunk toward the
 prize they somehow knew awaited them
 the fat little man stared with a growing
 horror at the forming ranks

   how do they know he bleated won-
 deringly to himself

   the bark exudes a resin that attracts
 them once the snare had trapped a prey
 explained alcan with a shout as the lashing
 tentacle of the other flower slowly stilled its
 movements and aftei a few twisting efforts
 to coil about his body lay still

   theyre coming cried the terrified
 prisoner get me free

   ill try alcan assured him gruffly his
 breathing still coming hard and irregular
 from his fight with the thing that had at-
 tempted to trap him

   catching up a long piece of a fallen limb
 from a nearby tree lawrence began to

 batter at the tentacle holding sinlet each
 blow he aimed at the base of the thing
 close to where it grew from the limb of the
 tree by the flower slowly his blows began
 to make an impression and the tough outer-
 bark was bruised and bleeding away its
 life-giving supply of sap

   in the name of empadre cried sinlet
 desperately get me loose theyre al-
 most here

   when alcan saw how true this was he
 redoubled his efforts and began smashing
 at the tentacle with all his might thewhip-
 lash tendons straining to give extra strength
 and fury to his blows crash the piece
 of limb he was using shattered into glancing
 fragments of flying chips as he smashed
 home another blow

   from his hand the useless end of the
 limb was dropped and lawrence attacked
 the tentacle itself with bare hands he
 y got a grip on the thing and strained with
 ill his might to force the coils to loosen
 for a few seconds it seemed that the thing
 was still strong enough to resist this assault
 but then slowly the folds of the thing un-
 coiled and sinlet fontaine was dropped
 from it to the ground where he lay with
 hands threashing wildly at the swarm of
 ants that had managed to reach him before
 his release

   stop still snapped the command from
 alcan as he went to work cleaning the
 bared arms of the man of ants

   within seconds the spy was free of the
 hungry little brutes and was being helped
 away from their mad swarming paths by
 the stranger he was paid to watch but this
 did not register on his mind for some
 moments his mind was too shocked by his
 narrow escape

   the moment he was fully aware of the
 situation he tried to shrink back away from
 lawrence but he was held tightly by the
 arm so tightly in fact that he could feel
 the pain of it stabbing up through his nerves
 toward his shoulder

   let me loose he demanded in a shrill
 i tightened voice

   not yet grated lawrence fiercely as
 lie forced his way back through the jungle
 growths toward the point where he had
 entered the jungle area in pursuit of this
 man

   by the time he was back on the clipped
 lawns it was dark with the tropical stars
pp-e 

glinting brilliantly in a sky that almost
seemed blue in the night svvifly he dragged
his luckless captive toward the seat where
he had left gwenetz he stopped abruptly
she was gone

  gone he said wonderingly his face
suddenly losing all the eager expression he
had known where will i ever find her
again

  turn me loose whispered sin let
anxiously his voice a pleading whine and
his arm throbbing with pain now as he
knew the full strength of the mans hand-
a force against which his puny strcngh was
as nothing

  first i want to know why youve fol-
lowed me ever since professor linitz gave
me my freedom queried the tall dark-
hcaded alcan

  i cannot tell you sinlet replied for hr
feared nothing now except that fierce
pressure on his arm he knew nothing of
crime having lived his life through in the
crimeless land of aztecasia

  speak barked lawrence his voice
risiig to a roar as some wild instincts were
wakened from the dark recesses of his
mind speak or ill break your arm

  a horrible look of terror hashed to th
face of sinlet for though a broken arm was
a minor trouble requiring only an hour
under the growth rays following a hor-
mone m injection the mere thought of
violence was so foreign to his nature anh
his way of thinking that he shuddered when
forced to think of it

  empadre taught us the ways of peace
he said quickly

  then why do you disturb my peace by
following me everywhere demanded the
enraged lawrence why

   was curious jerked out sinlet in his
shrill voice i wanted to know all about
the stranger to arrive in aztecasia

  a dulled feeling of being tricked came to
alcan as he stood there still holding his
prisoner these were new feelings new
emotions things wakened from the dark
heredity of his forebears things long
dormant and unused in his make-up a
feeling of greater living possessed him and
he knew the first wild thrill of power the
first elated satisfaction of frustration as hr
took his revenge in pain on this man who
symbolised all those who had rejected him
and fled from him as if he were an evil
come among them

thrills incorporated

  that is no truth you speak he snarled
viciously speak swiftly or else ill show
you the strength of my hand

  i cannot speak cried sinlet still un-
aware of his danger still resting in a long
knowledge that none broke the doctrines of
empadre

  then it was too late an angry snarl
escaping his lips alcan swung his right fist
over and smashed it into the side of the
little mans huge cranium a horrible
crunching sound was heard with the thud
of the blow landing sinlet went limp in
alcans grip and he slumped to the ground
the side of his thin-boned skull crushed
from that single blow

  anxiously lawrence stooped down over
the fallen man and tried to rouse him but
when he searched for the heart there was no
beat dully with a slow dawning of a near
vision alcan realised that he was looking
on death for the first time death he had
caused by a single blow in a land where
death came only from accident and old
age

  empadre he gasped softly i have
broken the great rule and am no longer one
of your people

  this thought shocked him to stillness to
silence for a long time as he stood staring
down at the dead man at his feet first
he felt nothing but shocked horror at what
he had done but slowly welling up into
consciousness from the inner depths of his
mind came a realization of satisfaction

  he felt it as a vague feeling of pleasure
at first and then as a wild exultant thrill of
achievement as he sensed that in some way
he was hitting back at the people who had
shunned him called him a freak and shut
him out from the road that he must follow
to his destiny

  no thought of concealing the body oc-
curred to him he could think of no rea-
son why he should there was no punish-
ment for murder in aztecasia there were
no police no officials no-one who could
protest against what he had done or molest
him for it only empadre father of peace
could condemn his action and with a reck-
less toss of his head alcan invited him to
do his worst

  all his knowledge of the doctrine had
come from books and the video screen and
so it was impersonal and now thinking
about it for the first time with any serious-
ness lawrence admitted to himself that
crimeless lend

empadre was no more than a word to him
nothing more than a sound that represented
mainly the great festival when the women
chose their mates and danced and sang in
the giant outdoor temple for this reason
it was a proud and haughty alcan lawrence
who stalked into the street and looked about
him a strong feeling of power coining to
him every lime he clenched that list

	  

a great feeling of satisfaction rode
high like the sparkling bubbles of
sematol liquor through the man as he
strutted down the street eiach male he
saw with his thin-boned huge cranium he

chuckled to himself and looked at his fist
in a single blow he now knew he could
crush the life from any of them any
single one of these men was at his mercy
if he chose these men who despised him
were nothing to him now

  power the idea was a heady fever to
alcan all his life he had been taught his
destiny and now when the time had come
for him to serve his purpose among the
peoples of aztecasia they had been re-
vulscd by his strangeness frightened by his
difference from all other males but that
didnt matter now he knew that he could
go forward and fulfill his destiny whether
there was fear and hatred of him or not
he had power

   back in his apartments he ate ravenously
of the fruits and nuts that had been pre-
pared for him and then he drank many long
draughts of the sparkling sematol liquor
before he retired to his divan for rest even
then he found he could not sleep and so
went to his huge library and busied himself
with a carefull rereading of a record of a
part of the era when the first global wars
occurred and for the first time he under-
stood fully many of the statements made

statements about the might and power of
individual men and nations of that time

  power he murmured to himself
thats what i have been bred to give these
people they lack everything when they
have no powerful leader they shrink away
from me because they do notunderstand
what i am but  will tell them  will
teach them much

   and so far into the night lie read  and
when at last he went to his divan he found
sleep elusive and he drank much more
sematol before he finally drifted into a deep
drugged sleep

  morning was far advanced before alcan
lawrence was about the following morning
and his mind was already made up on his
course of action it was as if lie had
planned and plotted through his sleeping
hours

   dressed in a clean outfit of tight-fitting
shorts and tunic-shirt he went to the apart-
ments of professor linitz and demanded to
see him after a time in response to his
urgent signalling  the video warner
linitz came from his laboratory and led
the way into the big room overlooking the
city the professors face was solemn as
he turned to the man he had helped to
raise

  what is it you want of me he asked
quietly his high-pitched voice toned down
to softness are not your apartments
cared for well have you some com-
plaint

  none growled alcan quickly that
is no reason for me to come to you i
come because of the destiny that is my
lot

  he paused and waited for the professor
to make some sign that he understood for
a long while linitz sat still as if he had
heard nothing as if thinking of something
far removed from this interview at last
he said

  you have not made contact with any
of the people of the city they fear you
for your difference from the males they
know-such men tis i am that is bad
too long we planned on other things so
that we forgot that such a thing might come
about i am working on an idea to change
all this soon over the whole video net-
work i will make you the most sought-after
man in all aztecasia

   all this was said with a quiet assurance
of a man who knows that success is cer-

tain and when he had finished he looked
up and smiled at alcan

  i have had youwatched so that  could
know of every possibility

  an angry hush spread through law-
rences face and he took a step closer to
the little bald-headed professor his fit
clenched and the muscles tightened all along
his arm as he glared down at the man
where he sat relaxed on a divan

  then it was you snarled alcan
angrily you who saw that  was never
left alone for a single minute saw that i
was followed and hunted like the wild things
in the jungle

  yes nodded the professor quietly it
was necessary i had to be certain that you
were not failing to achieve a meeting with
the people you did fail   

  so did your spy broke in lawrence
angrily i killed him he added proudly
lifting up the fist that had done it

  a deathly pale came over the face ol
linitz and he leaned forward from his posi- -
tion and all his face was tense as he stared
at alcan with solemn condemnation

  then it was no accident he whispered
softly you you who have been taught
and reared till this time for the good of
aztecasia you have broken the great
rule of empadre you have brought
death-murder it was called once-to this
land you have brought crime where there
was no wrong done

  i have brought power snapped back
alcan angrily if i broke the law of em-
padre i have not suffered for it i am still
living your spy is dead

  great trouble will come over the city
for this empadre will not forget or for-
give such a transgression never in living
memory of man has such a thing occurred
before now you alcan lawrence the
dream of a line of scientists for generations
you kill and break the great rule of em-
padre

  it was nothing snapped alcan fiercely
smarting under this lashing from the tongue
of the man who had been father and mother
to him through all the years he had been
shut away from the world preparing him-
self for his future

  nothing scoffed linitz fiercely
nothing is worse

  i havent come about this interjected
lawrence quickly i come because i want

to take to mate a girl called gwenetz al-
doon and i have no way of knowing in
which part of the city she lies i come to
ask you where she lives

  gwenetz ejaculated linitz suddenly
you have met her

v yes we talked for a time i will
mate with her

  but such saying is not according to
custom at the coming festival the women
will choose their mates for the many months
that follow you are a male and cannot
choose for yourself snapped the professor

  such is the way of the weakling men
of this city growled alcan fiercely i
am not as they and will not be bound as
they  have power with a single blow
i killed your spy i could kill others that
is power  have chosen this girl for mate
and i will have my way where does she
live

  when linitz stared at him silently for
a full minute alcan slowly raised his
clenched fist up and the huge-craniumcd
man of science shrank back in fear he
had been examining the body of sinlet
when alcan had demanded to see him and
he knew the fearful damage this man could
do to one of the males such as himself
who had a thin-boned skull covering the
great brain

   he reached a paper from his tunic pocket
and wrote an address on it handing it to
alcan slowly the tall fierce-eyed man
snatched it from him glanced at it briefly
and poked it into the pocket of his tunic

  to-day  will walk the terrace at the
temple and by my side will be the girl
gwenetz he rapped out as he turned to
leave the room

  behind him linitz stared after him and
his eyes were crinkled with worry as he
tried to work out what he should do had
it not been that he knew of the intended
arrangement between empeer and gwenetz
he would have delighted in the knowledge
that alcan had a mate but somewhere his
personal feelings for his assistant got in
the way of his belief in the future good
of the city and he wished that it were any
other girl lawrence had determined to
mate

  he reached across and pressed a button
a moment later a voice came through the
speaker as the video screen flickered into
life in the shape of a girls head
tcrimeless land

page 

   professor empeer is not available at the
moment she said

  ask him to come to me immediately
he is linitz snapped back quickly the
message is most urgent see that he re-
ports to me without fail

  and as the screen went dead linitz
whispered to himself

   ive got to warn empeer perhaps hell
be able to do something

  but though he gave the matter a con-
siderable amount of thought he could not
think of anything short of complete des-
struction and that was forbidden that
would stop the powerful man alcan

	 

even though linitz realised what the
possible outcomes of it might be he
knew that he had to warn the people of
aztecasia knew that they must be warned
against the power he had loosed among
them so reluctantly sensing that a life-
times work was being destroyed he con-
tacted the central video transcriber and
gave his brief message

   soon throughout the length and breath
of the city the dread word was being
whispered

  murder

  murder has been done

   the great rule of empadre father of
peace has been broken

   crime has come where there was none
great trouble must follow

  scarcely a tongue in the city didnt
phrase some warning such as this barely
a man who didnt glance round carefully
before he left a street car or moved into a
new turn of a street and from the great
inter-planetary communication station the
news was flashed to the workers on mars-
venus-and the moon

  in the temple of empadre the high
priestess delma prepared for the rituals
and ceremonies which she knew would be
demanded by the people once they had
overcome the first shock of the terrifying
news murder had been done and none
could remedy this save empadre himself
so to the temple the people would flock
and dance their rituals and be gay and
exhilarated though they moved in fear for
such happiness and contentment was the
demand made by the doctrine of empadre

  and from a deserted street car a lone
figure stepped as the automatic radio-

electric car came to a stop a first glimpse
of this lone figure and a bunch of children
ran scuttling for the shelter of their homes
for this was a district of small houses set
in park-like gardens and without walls or
fences between them

  to one of these alcan lawrence moved
slowly each step made firmly and his head
held high he was a proud lone man now
no longer did he fear for the rebuffs of the
aztecasians he had power

   since no door had a lock in the hitherto
crimeless city alcan did not have to knock
but simply opened the door and strode into
the dwelling it was furnished much as
all the city was with deep carpeting on the
floors simple comfortable furniture where
necessary and with the concealed indirect
lighting that seemed to glow from the walls
of the rooms themselves

  through the first two rooms he passed
without seeing a sign of life into the third
he strode and jerked to a stop as a terrified
shriek came from a cowering little figure
of a child in the far corner with a con-
temptuous glance around the room alcan
turned and strode out into a passageway
leading along to a further cluster of rooms

  there he was suddenly confronted by
gwenetz there was a slow tantalizing
smile on her face and she stood before him
waiting

   ive come for you he told her tersely
you and  will walk the terrace together
this day

  is it not the custom of aztecasia for
the women to choose the man with whom
they will mate she asked dryly

  i am not as these men and will not be
bound by the customs that bind them he
rapped out quickly i have power
strength-things that these men know
nothing of with one stroke of my hand
i can smash their thin-boned bald domes
this makes matters different for me

  the girl was caught in the new power
that tadiated from the man never had
she known a man to talk this way and to
her surprise she found that a deep thrill
of delight came up from some hidden
depths of her being-something akin to the
feeling she had known that first time she
had reached a hand to touch the stranger

  why then do you walk the terrace of
the temple of empadre she queried
why bow down to the doctrine you have
already broken
page 

thrills- incorporated

   it is not for me but you that i do this
he told her calmly there must be no slur
upon the children  father for they are to
be the future men of this land all aztec-
asia must accept them that is important
and the answer to your question

  and if i will not agree to this she
demanded pertly

 then i will use the new-found power
 have i will compel you he growled
slowly

  the skulls of we women are not thin
like the mens but thick and strong like
your own i am of your size and am no
weakling it is only the male children who
are born with large heads and small bodies
-weaklings physically and of tremendous
power mentally perhaps i can not be
compelled to do that i choose not to do
she replied softly an exciting ripple of
blood pulsing through her arteries as she
played with the stranger testing his strength
and determination 

  for some reason she could not know
some reason lost to consciousness in the
dim past of her kind gwenetz felt the
desire to be mastered for the first time
in her life she wanted to feel inferior to a
male for the first time she realised that
there were depths to her own nature she had
never known before-never known because
there had never been the strength to awaken
them

  i have no wish to harm you alcan
told her quietly his voice deep and resound-
ing like that of a large woman but you
will walk the terrace with me before the
gathered peoples of the city you have no
choice nor have i from the birth of
my grand-sires great grand-sire my destiny
was chosen by the wise men of that time
that destiny must be fulfilled and you are
a part of it neither of us has a choice in
this matter

  this did not seem to please the girl for
her taunting smile vanished and a frown
crossed her dark handsome features she
looked up at alcan and snapped

  ill not be a part of a scientific plan-
a mere experiment until you came this
city was content happy and followed the
doctrines of empadre without question for
the way had brought abundance for all and
a crimeless land now murder death
striking down for the first time a man in
this city which was neither accident nor old
ge 

   with a smile suddenly flashing across his
face alcan flashed a hand out and caught
the girl by an arm and held her firmly
though she struggled against him

  i have power lawrence told her
proudly i am not as these weakling men
of aztecasia you struggle vainly for no
single woman is my equal in strength you
will do as i say

   seeing that any further struggle against
him was useless gwenetz relaxed and a
slow smile of satisfaction came to her lips
again this was the surrender she desired
the surrender to a greater strength than her
own never before had she felt so content
within herself though for the past three
festivals she had walked the temple terrace
with a chosen man

  too looking on alcan lawrence now
she found there was none of her old revul-
sion toward him he did not seem wrong
to her almost it seemed that the short
large-headed weakling men of the city
were wrong women had not changed much
through the ages-only the men and the
girl looked now on alcan as if she had
discovered her own kin for the first time
she smiled

   i will walk the terrace with you she
submitted softly

  good then its decided he announ-
ced gruffly where is your video-radio-
phone i must announce this to the city
all the people must come in festival to see
us walk together down the long terrace
how i have longed to tread that path where
the precious stones and gold inlay make
their glitter in the sun

  in the next room she told him
quietly

   he disappeared for a couple of minutes
and then returned

   soon all the city will know he said
quietly we will go now

  she nodded disappeared for a few
moments into a third room of the group
and when she reappeared she was clad in
a tunic of flashing magic made by precious
stones set in it and a gold thread of pure
metal woven into the cloth lawrence
nodded his approval of the garment

   it becomes the occasion he told her
quietly

  then they went out from the dwelling
together and peering from behind the front
window the child who had been so terri-
fied a few moments earlier was now pres-
crimeless land

page 

ing his nose tight against the pane of the
window an expression of awed wonder on
his face

   gwenetz led alcan to a small rocket-car
which was parked by the front of the
dwelling and smiled

  well take my car she said the
street-cars will be too crowded at this time
as the people flock toward the temple
excellent he nodded quietly i have
never driven a car but in my studies 
learned all that there was to be known of
them i will take the controls

  but    but if youve never driven
before she began to protest

   i will take the controls he snapped at
 her coldly

   yes alcan she surrendered mar-
velling at herself for the way she submitted
to this man when never before had any

male been capable of gaining his own way
her beauty was great and with it she had
wielded her power now with this
stranger she found the desire to do so no
longer existed she threw back her head
and laughed her blonde hair catching the
fire from the tropical sunlight

   well drive around for a time till all
have had time to assemble he announced
when he had swung the car into a low speed
tier of a roadway heading away from the
temple

   the girl said nothing but sank back con-
 tentedly into the cushions of the seat when
 they were clear of the city alcan swung the
 car over to a take-off deck by the side of
 the roadway and switched the power con-
 trols to air-power then slipping a small
 lever into position he gently pressed home
 the throttle and gave the rocket tubes the

-	gun with a screaming lurch the car shot
from the deck and slammed the pair of
them hard back into the deeply cushioned
seat they were air-borne

  not so much power she gasped her
advice quickly when she had caught her
breath again that take-off was too
sudden

  he cut back the throttle control without
answering her and they circled up and over
the city in a great swooping spiral other
cars were also aloft and all were heading
in the one direction over a certain spot
they were forming up and awaiting their
turns to spiral down toward the temple
where it stood like a bizzarre tower in the
midst of its parklands

  the temple building itself was a great
tower reaching high-a hundred and fifty
feet into the air about its outer wall curled
the gem-studded and arched ramp which
was known as the terrace couples who
made the climb together made their vows
as they looked out over the peaceful city
this was aztecasias place for the public
acknowledgement of the choice a woman
had made

  when the air was cleared of cars making
their way to the temple and the great park-
lands about it were filled with waiting
people alcan lawrence swept his car down
in tight spirals set the under-jets in action
and settled neatly to the ground before the
main entrance to the temple itself the
high priestess moved forward to the car

  	v 

gwenetz and alcan stepped from the
car and the high priestess moved
slowly toward them lawrence stood and
stared at her in amazement she showed
no fear of him as she stood straight and
true before them tall and lithe with large
blue eyes setting off the blue-black colour-
ing of her hair she was a beauty chosen
from all the peaceful lands of aztecasia for
her beauty she now reigned as high priest-
ess of the temple of empadre father of
peace

  why do you come here she demanded
you who have broken the great ruie of
empadre

  her voice was deep and clear and the
tiny instrument pinned to the front of her
elaborate ritual robes picked up the voice
and relayed it through speakers so that
every citizen in the enormous gathering
could hear what was going on all could
see for the parklands were sloping up on
all sides from the temple

i comp to walk the terrace with this

woman lawrence replied calmly and
by thus doing to make my peace with em-
padre from the topmost part of his temple
there can be no peace with empadre
for breakers of the great rule she snapped
back viciously you a stranger among us
have brought crime where none was before
your coming men die of accident and old
age but none must die by the hand of
another thus it was that the father of
peace ordained

  quickly then she snapped off her instru-
ment and whispered swiftly as she stepped
closer to them

  i know of your destiny and i accept the
wisdom of the great men of many genera-
tions ago truly aztecasian men are
weaklings and since there is no longer need
for their great mentalities it is wisdom that
restores strength and a fine body to our
men

  then why do you deny me the right to
walk the terrace demanded lawrence
fiercely why try and prevent the inevit-
able-block the path of my destiny
this great gathering does not know or
understand it must be so happening that
they will not follow your unwise example
and sin against the doctrine i must chal-
lenge you

  i walk the terrace and none will stop
me growled alcan i have chosen this
woman for mate and we will walk together
the instrument clicked on again as a roar
of disapproval rose from the crowd when
they realised that something was being said
that they were not being allowed to hear

  only empadre himself can grant you
the right to walk-now that you have trans-

fressed his law cried the high priestess
ercely let him show some sign and you
may walk

  i must climb to the tower and make my
peace with the father of peace growled
lawrence stubbornly

  just then a tremendous awed gasp came
from the gathered multitude and from the
topmost point of the tower a great sheet
of flame leapt high into the air and vanished
leaving only a thin wisp of black smoke
hovering over the tower with a move-
ment as of one man the crowd shrank back
before this evidence of supreme acceptance
of the desire of the stranger again the
high priestess had her instrument clicked
off

  empadre works in many ways and after
all fashions she whispered swiftly move

swiftly and tread the path of your destiny

  he is wise above all things mouthed
lawrence as he saw the instrument clicked
on again there is the sign stand aside
that i may walk the terrace with this
woman

  truly the sign is given cried the high
priestess delma loudly tread the terrace
in peace with this one who has chosen you
for mate

  i did the choosing snapped alcan i
am not as other men and am not bound by
the rule which allows women the choice of
mate this woman is my choice

  and he mine added gwenetz swiftly
but the words were drowned in a tumul-
tuous roar of anger from the crowd

  here in the very face of empadre on
temple ground this stranger was defying
the right of women to have the choice
even the weakling men of the gathered
citizens were incensed at this for they saw
that they had not the strength to claim the
right and they therefore resented it when
another claimed it for himself

fool snapped delma angrily why
must you flout your strength in their faces

  i have power cried alcan an exultant
thrill of pleasure running through him as
he turned and swung a mighty arm in a
sharp arc the men shrank back instinct-
ively as if his arm could reach them in their
distant places on the slopes of the parklands
about the temple of gleaming marble

  again there was an angry uproar and the
mob began to move forward as if by some
concerted effort they planned to overwhelm
the stranger swiftly realising the danger
to the plans she had delma cried out
loudly

  walk the terrace of empadre with your
woman

  and lawrence and gwenetz moved for-
ward toward the commencement of the
spiralling ramp that wound its way about
the circular tower till it reached the top
where all was a blaze of gold and inlay of
precious stones

  suddenly among the crowd there was a
stir quite close to the temple court and then
a silence more ominous than the initial stir

  go quickly whispered the priestess of
the temple

  so alcan and the girl stepped forward
with long confident strides and the girl
thrilled as she realised that all eyes were
focused oh her she knew for the first
crimeless land

page 

lime the joy of fame and she determined
to know more of it

  they were no more than five yards up
the first section of the terrace than a aztec-
asian man burst from the foremost ranks ol
the crowd and ran forward as fast as hi
short legs would carry him in his hand
he brandished a knife commonly used in
the city for the carving of wood figures
which was one of the artistic pursuits
avidly followed by the citizens in their
utopian peace

  he was more like alcan lawrence than
many of the men of the city and taller
than most about his head was a fringe
of hair circling the hald clear space on top
though large of head and with the
characteristic small ears he was nevertheless
much like alcan-certainly more like him
than the average aztecasian man

  when he was close up to the high priest-
ess he pausecwor a moment long enough to
call

  i am empeer professor of the bio-
logical sciences i am the sire of this
stranger even as he was bred for a destiny
so was i he is more unlike you than i
but  am enough like to him to know the
desire for the things he wants this woman
is promised to me for mate and ill not see
her stolen from me by this transgressor of
the doctrine in the name of empadre i
will destroy this soiler of the temple of the
father of peace

  his voice was almost hysterical as he
shrilled out the information even to
alcan lawrence it was news for he had
never been told of the whereabouts of either
father or mother and he had assumed they
no longer lived certainly he did not
think ever that empeer was the sire-the
link in the chain leading back through six
generations to the time when it was first
decided that there must be men who were
strong in body as well as mind

  so hes my father alcan mused as
he and the girl paused to look back and
observe the scene

  then now  understand many things
smiled the girl quietly i thought that
he had more than the welfare of the people
at heart when he bade me promise to be-
friend you

  there was no further time now for talk
for empeer was rushing toward them
brandishing the carving knife and shouting
shrilly

  you alcan you have destroyed the
worth of all our work transgressed the
doctrine and killed now it is your turn
to die long ago men used such weapons
as this and effectively since peace has
come we have lost the art of fighting but i
will be your equal with this tool of artistry

  the light burning deep in empeers eyes
bore a strong glint of anger and of hatred
for twenty-three years he had worked to
see that at last after so long there would
be a return to strength among the future
men of aztecasia now before him he
could see only the man who threatened to
rob him of his mate-his promised com-
panion for the months that followed the
festival

  to empeer a bred-back type closely
allied with alcan himself the emotions of
hate and the desire for power came readily
and he could not bear the thought of defeat
by his own off-spring

  stay back fool cried lawrence in
warning stay back or you will follow
sinlet to doom

  but these words useless as they were
never reached the mans mind for they were
drowned out by the mighty roar of anger
that was swelling up from the vast crowd
this stranger was more than a murderer- y
he was also a stealer of women and a traitor
to the ways aztecasians had been taught to
follow furiously they surged forward as
if they would tear the stranger limb from
limb

  but alcan had no chance to observe this
for his attention all was needed to watch
the savage rush of empeer who was
running up the ramped terrace toward him
the evil glint of diamondized steel glinting
in the sunlight the point of that tool was
sharp as steel could be and the diamond-
izing process had fixed that vicious sharp-
ness for all time nothing but time itself
could wear away the edge of the tool

  on empeers face was a diabolical look
of satisfaction as he asserted himself for
the first time after all the years of living
a masked existence as a normal aztecasian
they clashed together and the first wild
thrust he made with the wicked tool was
a complete miss as alcan ducked low
under it then sweeping it back again the
sharp edge slashed a thin wound along
alcans arm and blood flowed

  pain stabbed from the wound and jolted
lawrences nerves and he suddenly snapped
pago 

thrills incorporated

into a fury of activity as he fought to get
a position where he could swing in a mur-
derous blow to empeers head for a
minute they parried each other off with one
movement after another each man moving
instinctively away as danger flashed toward
him in the shape of either fist or carving
tool

  power grated alcan under his breath
thats what i need hes no thin-boned
aztecasian i can kill with a blow there
must be some other way ill get the
carving tool

  once that decision had occurred to him
alcan dodged sideways ducked a thrust
from the flashing instrument already
dripping in blood and then he whipped a
hand out and caught at the wrist of empeer
with the grip firmly caught with his left
hand alcan swung a wild hay-making
right that crashed onto the side of empeers
head there was a jarring of bone on
bone and empeer swayed under the impact
of the blow but he did not go down

  then lawrence concentrated all his at-
tention on the wrist he still held trapped
and he applied all the pressure he could
and a squeal of pain ripped from the shrill-
voiced professor but immediately empeer
swung up a foot carefully laced in leather
and then slammed it into alcans shins
yelping his anger lawrence realeased his
grip for long enough to allow the older
man to escape

  again they clashed and this time it was
alcan who was first to learn from experi- 
ence and he kicked up high from the inlaid
terrace floor and his leathered foot sank
deep into the stomach of his opponent
empeer went down and the carving tool
clattered away from his hand

  before the fallen man could recover
from the treacherous blow alcan lawrence
had caught him up and raised him high
up above his head as he wheeled and
walked toward the edge of the terrace for
a brief moment he poised himself and then
shouting angrily he hurled empeer over
and down through forty feet of nothingness
to the paved court below a gasp of
horror of fear rose up from the watching
mass

  their first movement toward the terrace
had been checked by delma loosing another
fiery blast of flame from the peak of the
temple tower and then they stood and

watched the fight with a fascination only
registered on the faces of those who see
things for the first time no man living
in that age had ever seen a fight before and
the sight of it thrilled yet shocked them
into silence

  but closc on the heels of that first gasp
of horror that escaped when empeer
crashed down to his death there rose up a
mumbling and angry roar from the mob

  the stranger had polluted the court of
the temple with death rose the cry and
delma sensing that any further protection
of alcan would be useless switched on her
instrument and called

  empadre demands that this non-
believer be no more this killer in the
court of the father of peace must be him-
self killed through his veins runs the
wild blood of our distant ancestors who
fought through the great global wars and
then continued through the dark ages to
fight still he is not as we are but of a
vicious mind like the leopard of the
jungle

  her voice was rhythmic and wild as she
called this to her people

  men can not stand against this stranger
who has great strength but we women are
not weaklings as our men come forward
all you women who are true followers of
the doctrine of empadre and aid the father
of peace to bring peace once more to aztec-
asia

  weve got to get out of here barked
lawrence fiercely turning to where
gwenetz had been standing

  she was no longer there and he spun
round toward the slope leading to the court
below and he saw that the girl had fled
from him growling his disgust alcan
gathered up the fierce carving tool and
glared down towards the gathering mob of
women below

   cant fight them all he snarled to
himself their weight would force me
down

  for a moment he stood still alone
deserted by the girl who had been so drawn
to him from his position he could see
and hear what was happening below and
he knew what the high priestess planned
for him he glanced up to the top of the
tower high above him atid then back to the
ground no man could withstand a fall like
that
crimeless land

hile delma high priestess of aztec-
asia was gathering her forces for an
attack on the man who had awakened the
hatred and anger of the people by his
deliberate disobedience of the doctrine of
empadre alcan himself was planning too
he could see but one hope for himself-
one chance to save his life and he was
determined that he would not die deter-
mined that he would live to have power
and recognition among these people that he
might fulfill the destiny mapped out for him
so long ago

  twenty-three years of careful and skilled
teaching had left him with the dominating
thought that he must fulfill the task for

which those six generations of careful
planning had been carried out it was not
that he thought of these people or any
duty he had to them it was simply that
deep in the deepest recesses of his mind
and on upward through all his levels of
consciousness there had been planted the
idea of his destiny and that alone acted as
a motivating force to guide his actions now

  it was the irrational unthinking action
of a man acting under compulsion the
compulsion of his destiny as it had been
taught him he had to lie and mate ac-
cording to the customs of the city for he
was brought to being for the sole purpose
that future men in aztecasia would be
strong of body and without the huge dis-
torting heads and thin-boned craniums he
was to restore to men a pride in their man-
hood and wipe away the weakling strain
of physical types who had served their pur-
pose in the ages gone when tremendous
feats of intellectual activity had been neces-
sary

  so now believing that to attack would
be his best form of defence he charged
suddenly down the terrace ramp toward the
confused milling bunch of women who had

page 

volunteered to carry out his destruction
under the leadership of delma high priest-
ess of the temple of empadre

  screaming great shouts of defiance and
brandishing the carving tool alcan swept
down at the force assembling on the court
shrill cries from the men were the first
warning the women received and as they
wheeled they came face to face almost
immediately with the charging man who
held lie vicious edge of the tool out before
him in such a way that any who got in the
way of it would be cut down

  stop him cried delma angrily he
must not escape

  but the first line of women broke and
fled before his assault for they were none of
them used to fighting-not even to hear of
it until that day when alcan and his father
fought on the terrace of the temple before
the assembled masses of the people of the
city

  swiftly too the second group scattered
as he swooped across toward them then
delma and four others stood their ground
and waited for him quickly he checked
his pace and eyed the route he wanted to
take from the corner of his eye he could
see the rocket-car and the cluster of men
around it

  out of my way he growled at delma

  i accepted the decisions of the wise men
of the past she said slowly but now
 see that it is better to have men who
are weaklings yet live in peace than men
who are strong yet defy custom and bring
crime trampling horribly through a crime-
less land aztecasia is well content to stay
in peace and there is no peace where men
such as you are born power brings greed
and envy and with these things comes
trouble fighting is something our peoples
forgot many ages ago and now you have
recalled it all with men such as you
there would be a rebirth of the wars that
came close to destroying all human life on
the earth earthmen are heirs to all the
planets for no life is there though condi-
tions are suitable on many of them

  out of my way he barked viciously
moving closer and his lips drawn back in a
primitive snarl of anger

  ill not move without such men as
you there will always be peace even after
all the lands of the earth are repeopled
again the surplus peoples will colonize the
planets and there will be no need for war
page 

thrills incorpprated

because of want of land and space to live
death for you is the answer and empadre
and his doctrine will be safe once more
if there is no physical strength without
desire for power then well have none of
it death is the order of empadre

  this last sentence was directed toward
the four women grouped around her and
a little behind the tense tones of the
priestess of the temple seemed to give them
new courage and they backed away no
further

  ill not die till my destiny had been
accomplished alcan growled with the
fierceness of the fanatic theres no death
can come before i reach the goal of my
destiny	

  with these words he lept aside suddenly
moving away from the rocket car and to-
ward a regathered group of the women who
had scattered before his assault from the
terrace ramp delma shouted to her sup-
porters and the four women leapt to follow
with her as she moved after alcan

  as they came the man suddenly checked
himself pivoted dived low using all the
power of the corded muscles of his legs to
hurl himself straight for the legs of delma
herself he crashed into her and spilled
her to the ground and over them toppled
the four women rushing up from behind to
give her aid

  from that screaming jumble of arms and
legs lawrence fought his way up and leapt
to his feet still he had the carving tool
in his hand and he charged madly for the
rocket-car a man got in his way and
a savage swing of his fist dropped the fel-
low to the ground with his thin-walled skull
shattered from about the car the other
men lured there by their curiosity
scrambled to escape two more fell with
fatal wounds as alcan cleared himself a
path to the car

  once there he leapt inside and slammed
the door and sealing it so that it could
not be opened from without swiftly his
hands worked on the controls and within
a space of half a minute the rocket tubes
of the car were roaring into life as the angry
mobs of aztecasians charged forward when
they saw the man was escaping

  stop him delma was crying the order
shrilly as she came up from the floor of
the court having finally struggled free of
the heap of twisting frightened women

  but even before the sentence was finished

the rocket car rose up from the court with
a mighty roar of rocket tubes and the
flaming exhaust cut a swathe of death
through the front ranks of the crowd who
raced forward to try and prevent the
escape higher and higher climbing in
tight spirals that zoomed him into the sky
above the temple alcan looked back and
growled to himself

  ill be back theres no way you fools
can defeat me no way to prevent me
controlling the city and all of you

  but screaming up from the court below
him came a flight of ten rocket-cars all
with flaring rocket tubes telling of the
mighty power they were using to thrust
the craft upward as women held their hands
tight on wide-open throttles

  theres nothing they can do to me
alcan growled to himself but the assurance
lacked conviction for he was certain that
these women would not have wasted time
coming after him in their craft if they had
not believed they could do something about
him

  at fifteen thousand feet he levelled out
and headed away from the city he was
not worried about fuel for the rocket-car
for he knew that when a car was built it
was stocked with sufficient atom-
decomposition fuel to last the ship all the
time it was allowed in use when time for
recall came the craft was returned to the
giant automatic factory and another new
car issued

  before he had cleared the limits of the
city he knew that the ten rocket cars were
right behind him and slightly above for
he could view them clearly in the video
screen set in the panel in front of him this
screen could be switched to view the air
from any direction of the compass for the
permanent eyes of the screen were located
in the outer shell of the craft and could be
called on to report at will

  a distance of fifty perhaps sixty miles
from the city alcan was suddenly having
trouble in guiding his car and he switched
on the rear viewer to find where the other
cars were nine of them were still in
formation behind the tenth could not be
seen anywhere

  rapidly he juggled the controls in an
effort to pick up sight of the tenth craft
when he switched to the eye in the top of
the craft he got nothing but a dull screen
and all the while he found despite every
crimeless land

page 

effort he made to keep his car aloft he
was gradually losing altitude and being
forced slowly toward the earth beneath

   on to the video screen flashed the image
of delma high priestess of the temple of
empadre and she was solemn and deter-
mined as she announced calmly

   theres nothing you can do alcan my
craft is more powerful than yours and i
am clamped to the top of your ship by the
special anchor-magnetism mechanism
whether you like it or not youre going to
land

  shrugging his shoulders disgustedly
lawrence gave up fighting that ship that
was stuck to his back and from then on
the two ships dropped down much more
rapidly and when approaching the ground
alcan turned on his under-jets and settled
his car down gently there was a deal of
swaying of the car for the other car
clamped by magnetism to the top of his ship
made the whole unstable when they were
not under power and airborne

   knowing that whatever it was that had to
be faced would come eventually no matter
what he did alcan lawrence climbed from
his car in time to see the ten ships settling
down gently for immediately she was sure
he was out of the craft delma had released
her magnetism clamp and then settled her
ship down beside his

  quickly she got from the car and came
toward the man but he held the knife in
his hand now and it was forbidding as he
waited

  what now he demanded fiercely
that was a clever trick but what did it
gain you i warned you i wasnt dying till
i had fulfilled my destiny

  empadre looks after his own she
quoted softly we intend to take you back
to the temple to be hurled from the top-
most point of the tower so that peace may
once more live in the land

  we waste much time complained an-
other of the women nervously

   they were all at least as tall as alcans
five-feet-ten and some were broad of
shoulder and determined looking in all that
ten lawrence could not see a single face
that was not intent on watching his every
move lest he try to make another escape

   now cried delma suddenly

   as she gave the signal all ten of the un-
armed women leapt in to the attack from
some mysterious concealment each pro-

duced a short bar of metal spanner and
with these held ready they converged rapidly
on to alcan he backed up till he was hard
against the shell of delmas rocket-car and
there he determined to make his stand

   once he was established there he waited
and his carving tool was held ready now
before now some inner sense had found
him reluctant to harm a woman but now
only the most basic law of all prevailed-
self-preservation he gritted his teeth and
set himself for the assault which he expected
would be a fierce attack from all ten women

   this prediction proved right and before
ten seconds had passed delma raised her
arm suddenly and the women leapt in
swiftly alcan plied the vicious tool and
cut one down with a wounded shoulder and
then warded off a smash from a spanner
before he could strike again several smash-
ing blows hit his body and he winced with
pain as one crashed just under his heart
ripping the tool up angrily he sank it deep
into flesh and dragged it free as another
wounded woman fell

  but from that point alcan knew it was
hopeless they were too many and with
the spanners for arms they could batter his
knife thrusts aside and so protect them-
selves fairly well in the wild melee that fol-
lowed lawrence saw a slender chance and
he dropped the carving tool leapt with all
his power and twisted his arms about the
body of delma high priestess of the
temple

  roughly he got his arms about her
throat in a strangle hold and the spanner
relaxed from her fingers as he dragged her
back toward the shell of her car for a
second the other women were taken by
surprise but then they began to close again
with even greater fury than ever before for
now they fought to release delma who was
virtual queen of aztecasia on account of
her position as high priestess

   stop snarled alcan fiercely come
closer and ill kill this priestess of yours

  the women stopped suddenly as they
saw the pallor of delmas skin and their
arms dropped to their sides as they waited
to see what would follow

  all of you he commanded them
fiercely get those two wounded women
and all of you head back to the city tell
the people that i plan another walk on the
terrace this time there will be no mis-
takes for ill walk with the high priestess

herself by my side tell them i mean
them no harm and want only to fulfill my
destiny among them-my people

  the high priestess never mates for if
she does then the doctrine says that her
mate becomes high priest of the temple
and assumes her position and her authority
snapped one woman

  exactly purred alcan with a twisted
smile and who among you would at-
tempt harm to the priest of empadre
father of peace this is the way in which
my destiny will be fulfilled

  ill not leave her cried one of the
women angrily

   if you stay shell die and empadre will
suffer badly with no priest in his temple
to perform his rituals and aztecasia will
find that trouble will come in great waves
over the land he snapped back at them
sarcastically

  come one said let us do as he
says empadre must not be without a
priest in his temple

  the two wounded women were picked up
and taken to different rocket-cars and
within a few minutes seven of the cars quit
the spot and blasted their way into the
heavens and then wheeled round to head
for the city with the news of their defeat
and the plan of alcan the stranger of
power in their midst

     	 
tragging delma into her powerful
u rocket-car alcan tore his tunic into
long strips and with these bound the girls
hands behind her back and then tied to the
seat support her legs

  thatll keep you quiet and out of my
way till i need you he growled sombrely
a cruel twisted smile showing on his lips
i wanted to live as it was ordained but you
and your people thought me a freak hated
and feared me now now ill live as 
please for in all aztecasia there is none who
would dare to harm the high priest of the
temple of empadre then my destiny will
live and be fulfilled a hundred fold from
all the most beautiful women in the land
will be born sons like unto myself the
weakling men of aztecasia will be as
nothing beside these men of strength and
power my destiny will flower like the
great red blooms of the tiger tree and the
tentacles of it will reach out and probe the
future through the power and strength of

my children not for nothing did wise men
plan in distant times

   there was a note of exultant certainty to
his voice now for he could see no way in
which his plan could be stopped all be
could know and feel was the tremendous
satisfaction that stemmed from the know-
ledge that his purpose would be accom-
plished linitz had worked well with alcan
and his teachings were now flowering in
the fearful will to power shown by this
strange man among the peace-loving
dwellers of the city

  youll not accomplish what you plan
snapped delma tartly

  and who is there to stop me he de-
manded fiercely i have the power and the
way to accomplish all none can stay my
hand for they are bound by the doctrine of
empadre father of peace and there are
none among them who has the courage to
flout his decrees

  empadre will not see his children bur-
dened with the vicious children of your
loins she replied with certainty

  alcan laughed he had flouted the doc-
trine of empadre since that night when
sinlet fontaine had died and he was none
the worse for it great peals of laughter
broke from his lips and he ran strong
fingers through his hair to get it from his
eyes as he roared with laughter

  empadre he guffawed what has he
done to prevent me from breaking the great
rule many men are dead and i live many
are wounded and i have but a scratch upon
my arm

   the girl was silent and after a couple of
minutes alcan bare to the waist now
checked the controls of the craft and set
them for take-off

  with a mighty roaring blast of rocket
tubes he hurtled the ship into the sky and
levelled her out at thirty thousand feet and
then with reduced throttle swung the craft
round lazily to head back in the direction
of the city he was in no hurry now for
he wanted togive them plenty of time to
realize that there was absolutely nothing
they could do to prevent him going through
with his plans

  afternoon was long advanced by now and
the dark shadows of the sun were flung in
endless changes of pattern over the earth
below they cruised over jungle and
desert in that leisurely speed of a thousand
miles per hour then suddenly making
crimeless land

page 

up his mind lawrence set the throttle wide
and swooped down out of the heavens
toward the city and when within range of
the spot he cut his throttle back till there
was scarcely a show of flame from the
rocket exhausts and gently spiralled the
craft down toward the temple where he saw
that the parklands were still packed with
people waiting anxiously for his return

  patient arent they he grinned with
satisfaction as he noted the girl looking
over the port side down toward the temple

  youll never achieve your aim she
snapped back fiercely aztecasia will never
be dominated by men who kill and steal

the days of peace came with the doctrine
of empadre those days will never be lost
again

  with a deft swing of the controls alcan
got his craft out of the flight lane in which
he saw a pilotless space ship coming in to a
perfect landing at the field where such ships
delivered their precious burdens of minerals
from mars venus and the moon

  then under-jets blazing alcan set the
rocket-car down to rest in the court close
up to the terrace ramp leading up to the
top of the temple tower he smiled once
he had walked the length of that winding
gem-studded terrace to the very top with
delma at his side he would automatically
become her mate and so assume her posi-
tion becoming the high priest of the temple
and a man beyond the power and courage
of the aztecasians to harm

  it took but a flick of the carving tool to
cut the strips of material free from the girls
legs and then reaching across he pushed
open the door and thrust her out in front
of him with the carving tool held close to
her back

  there was an awed silence as the faith-
ful saw their high priestless captive to the
tranger who had broken the codes of

empadre scarcely a sound was heard as
they watched the two moye to the centre of
the court gwenetz aldoon moved up close
and alcan called a warning to her

  stay well clear of me he shouted
come too close and ill finish her off for
good death of delma will bring much
trouble to this land

  ill not come closer gwenetz said
fiercely but youll not achieve your ends
empadre will see to that

  alcan smirked at this and turned to lead
his captive toward the ramp of the terrace
that would itself round and round the tower
through the hundred and fifty feet or more
to where the top of the tower showed in
the late afternoon light

  alcan a shrill voice called fiercely
wait i must talk with you

  lawrence recognised the voice of linitz
and he turned to face the professor but
he still kept his eye on the girl he had
prisoner and also on the nearest of the
massed citizens of the city

  speak he commanded swiftly i have
little time for the light is failing

  you must not do this protested linitz
fiercely it was no part of the plan that
you should steal the right to the high priest-
hood of the temple

  it was no part of the plan either that
these fools should scorn and scoff at me
barked alcan angrily they treated me as
if i were lower than their weakling giant-
headed men now it will be different for
they will be compelled to respect and look
with awe on me they will know then what
it is like to be outcast from society

  but lawrence protested linitz trying
to reason with alcan your destiny what
of the purpose for your being what of
the future

  a great burst of laughter rocked from the
throat of the man then and it took him some
time before he could speak

  my destiny that will be fulfilled a
hundred-fold from all the most beautiful
women in the city will come sons to fulfill
the destiny time has allotted to me once
i am high priest the rest will come for my
commands must be followed

  a shocked look of horror crept over the
face of the old scientist as he stered at this
man this product of many lifetimes of work
and study he could not believe that men

if ----

were once like that-arrogant spiteful
greedy jealous eager for power and proud
only of their strength he shook his head
and stared at the young man he was fine
to look on but there was something wrong
inside-a normal person couldnt live with
such ideas of that the old professor was
certain but the thing that grieved him most
was the secret that he alone knew he was
blood of blood with this outlaw man who
was stealing the power in aztecasia

  two generations ago linitz had been
trained for his job and his son was likewise
trained and so too was his sons son alcan
lawrence trained carefully for his
destiny but somewhere along it had become
twisted and was no longer the same
linitz turned away for he saw that the
end was soon coming there was nothing
anyone could do now

  blood of my blood he kept mumbling
to himself as he moved away slowly

  lets go now snapped alcan as he
prodded delma gently with the point of the
carving tool

  she said nothing but turned to walk
slowly toward the ramp that led the terrace
up through the semi-twilight of the late
afternoon around her shoulders hung the
ceremonial robes of her position as high
priestess of the temple once they had
reached the top she knew that the stranger
would remove them from her shoulders
and place them around his own then the
city and the peaceful way of life it followed
would be lost for ever the doctrine of
empadre would die and there would be
nothing to live in its place

  hurry he snapped at her fiercely we
must reach the top before darkness falls
that all those gathered will see me don the
robes of the high priesthood

  empadre will not allow it she retorted
spiritedly

  but they were more than thirty feet up
the terrace and still nothing had happened
to prevent the stranger from accomplishing
his purpose all around the temple the
people stood with tense silent faces as they
waited and watched many were already
resigned to the invitable but the most de-
vout among them still believed that some-
thing would come about that would prevent
the murdering stranger from achieving his
rnd

fjfct forty feet delma stumbled wearily

forward and grinned to herself grimly as
she heard the muttered curse from alcan
then from that stumbling movement she
flung herself flat onto the inlaid floor of
the terrace and the marble arches curved
and rolled above her as she spun round
so that she could face up toward alcan

  there was an intense excited expression
on her face now as she reared up her legs
swiftly and jack-knifed them forward and
up taken completely by surprise law-
rence was bending forward to lift the bound
girl to her feet and he collected the flats of
both her leathered feet in the chin and was
sent sprawling back with a foggy dazed
expression clouding his eyes

  he fell down the slope and staggered to
his feet almost as quickly as did delma a
worried frown came to her face as she saw
her way of escape cut off

  swiftly she turned to the low wall beside
the terrace and by it she shrugged her cere-
monial robes from her shoulders and then
pushed them over the wall with her foot
they went fluttering down toward the court
below at full voice she cried

  gwenetz aldoon will assume the robes
when i no longer have a right or claim to
them

  all those below heard this and the angry
snarling from the man on the terrace

  that makes no difference so long as
youre still alive when we get to the top the
robes are mine he yelped out at her
youll pay for that kick when we reach
the top

  youll never achieve your aim she
taunted him fiercely empadre will see to
that

	 

as delma turned back toward the wall
alcan sensed her intention and he
leapt across the short space that separated
them and then grabbed her roughly by an
arm and shook her fiercely

  youll not do that he growled at her
fiercely ill not be cheated now destiny
is an endless chain and you are but a part
in mine-a link therell be no broken
links

  struggling furiously the beautiful dark-
headed girl fought to get clear of that
clutching grasp her arms were bound and
there was little that she seemed to be able
to do then as in a last resort she tried
with her feet it was the natural outcome
crimeless land

page 

of the situation and since she was held close
to him and facing him she could no nothing
but kick at his shins and that seemed futile

   to stop her doing this he stamped on her
 foot and a cry of pain ripped from her lips
 as she jerked the leg up to reach for the
 injured part all this happened in a flash
 and her knee was smashed into his groin
 and he cried out one terrible groan as he
 doubled down releasing her but still keep-
 ingher on tne top side dtftim

   he lay groaning for a moment or two

 to the low wall and jumped over it through
 a marble atch and  her body went huruiug

 	down  thsmgk  forty - feet  to  ras-h  sate  the
 court - for a- long time t here was a horrible
 stunned silence below then a terrific angry
 scream from the women

   gwenetz took up the robes of the high
priestess position and placed them about
her shoulders for she now understood what
delma had meant when she had let the
robes fall over the wall so that the temple
of empadre was not without a priestess and
alcan was cursing in red-faced rage as he
stood looking down toward the girl who
had cheated him then something else
made him look elsewhere for he caught the
sound of snapped commands and he knew
the voice

   down below he saw that all rocket-cars
were being removed from the court while
gwenetz was swiftly marshalling a bunch of
nearly fifty eager women who were deter-
mined to ascend the ramp to see that alcan
paid for his crime in the way that delma
had decreed

   ive got to beat them down again he
cried fiercely to himself

   but he was still twenty feet from the
bottom of the terrace when he saw the
entrance close with a solid mass of women
coming slowly up to meet him he was
trapped he looked over the side and
thought of jumping down there but the
court was now filled with angrily screaming
women and they were so tight packed that
there was no chance of him escaping that
way

   dont injure him unless necessary
ordered gwenetz quickly we want him
to know whats happening to him

   death to the murderer came the chant
 from the court

   desperately glancing first one way and
then another alcan backed slowly up the
ramp away from the grim bunch of women
who were armed with spanners taken from
the rocket-cars thirty of them moving up
toward him all alcans thoughts were
occupied with a desperate search for some
method of escape gone now was every
vaunted desire for power and revenge on
these people who had treated him as an out-
cast tjnly escape-that was the only word
that played constantly through his mind as

 nearly sixty feet from the court below aican
 stood his ground and waited for them when
 they charged he stood for a moment and
 then leapt back so that two or three over-
 ran themselves and before they knew it they
 were tasting the cold steel of the carving
 tool

   this vicious counter-attack provoked 
tremendous howl of anger from the other
women and they rushed again and this time
they kept coming and flying spanners and
flashing blade worked fiercely as they fought
him back up to eighty feet from the court
his left arm was hanging limp where a
woman swinging a heavy spanner had
crushed his arm and shattered the bone

   this is your destiny alcan taunted
gwenetz as she wielded a spanner at him
death death is a friend of yours the
sort of death youll be meeting-violent and
awful just like the men youve sent to
their doom

   destiny cried alcan his voice terrible
 in the sudden broken horror of his recogni-
 tion of defeat

   all his power was being stripped from
him now and he was weakening fast under
this relentless attack from the women who
kept pressing up leaving their wounded
behind to be taken care of by others coming
up through the shadows from below

  one hundred feet up and alcan law-
rence product of more than six generations
of scientific care and effort turned and fled
the twenty women who were still pressing
him his left arm was useless and two
savage gashes were along his head where
page 

thrills incorporated

spanners had connected and broken the
skin wide

   destiny he was calling shrilly to him-
 self as he fled surely destiny didnt
 ordain that six generations of effort should
 end like this six generations during which
 time all that was to come was this failure
 nothing defeat

   and then he was fighting on the very top
 of the tower and though his carving tool
 drank blood many times as he forced his
 weary arm to flash it out in defence there
 was nothing he could do to stop the slowly
 closing arc of women who were grimly
 forcing him back toward the surrounding
 wall

   then swinging her spanner savagely
gwenetz crashed the carving tool from
alcans hand and the women dropped their
spanners swiftly as they rushed forward
ten pairs of hands had him before he could
do anything to defend himself his arms
were pinned to his sides and he stood glar-
ing desperately into the face of the new
high priestess of the temple

   carry out the order of delma she said
 tersely

   as the women picked him up she turned
away swiftly and didnt look as eager hands
flung him from the topmost point of the
temple tower rising like a cry from hell
itself alcans death scream floated up
through the night and cutting it off short
just before he crashed to the ground came
a long defiant shout of

   destiny

   there was joy and relaxation written on
 the faces of the men when they saw the
 body and the following day was appointed
 as the beginning of the festival when danc-
 ing singing and the ritual ceremonies would
 be carried out and the women would choose
 their mates and walk the sloping terrace to
 the top of the tower

   then when all the crowds had finally
gpne gwenetz went into the temple and
slumped down in her special room in a
little while a knock sounded on the door
and she called for the person to enter
professor linitz came slowly into the room
he looked old weary am aoaui -ready - to
sleep one night for the last time

   its over now he said softly all

manygthersajl wasted now finished the

taken when they decided to breed back to
an original type and so improve the men
of the future in aztecasia

  his voice was slow soft and defeated
 there was nothing more now for him to live
 for he was through with his part in the
 venture and gwenetz looked across slowly
 and smiled

  perhaps its not yet finished she ven-
 tured slowly perhaps a son may yet be
 born to alcan lawrence

   dont understand stammered the old
 man quietly how

  rocket-cars are most comfortable she
 laughed at him enjoying his embarrassment
 but only time can tell whether it will be
 a boy or a girl

  the old man brightened  and his eyes
 lighted as he seemed to look into the
 future

  perhaps there is still some hope he
 mused quietly we would never make the
 mistakes again no other alcan lawrence
 would be thrust on the city do you think
 it might be a boy

  there was a note of pleading in the voice
 of the large-headed bald little man as he
 looked at the girl she smiled mysteriously
 in a way that only women can
