speaker selenium we know has strong photo-
electric properties but all the elements even in
the acccpfced tabic of elements have not yet been
discovered how then can we be assured that
some new element more remarkable than selenium
for its photo-electric properties may not be dis-
covered-an element strong enough to make pos-
sible enormous distance radio communication-
perhaps even with another planet which might be
inhabited our author gives us here a story oi
unusual scientific interest cxcccdingly -well
written

when inca-land revolted by woods
peters almost all great discoveries have been due
to accidental findings often during experiments
made in domains of science seemingly far removed
from the held of discovery it can hardly be
considered beyond the realm of possibility there-
fore that some enterprising and imaginative young
scientist might accidentally discover a means  for
transmitting personality it would prove a minor
matter to devise a means for accompanying such
transmission with the voice  in this fascinating

gas

by t oconor sloane phd

mankind has to devise means for exerting more
and more power as the world progresses the re-
quirements of manufacturing building and traveling
constantly appeal for larger use of power in a
general way we may classify matter under three
principal divisions  solid liquid and gaseous the first of course
we know is rigid requires force to break it or to bend it out of
shape it seems to present itself as the best material for exer-
cising force and developing power solid matter used in the
arts and in mechanics is generally metallic and of all the metals
those wife the iron base are tlie most used bui there is very
little iron in the world and when the iron mines are exhausted
it is hard to say what will be done but fortunately in spite of
all tlie machinery we see about us the total amount of iron used
is very little comparatively speaking if man were dependent
on iron as such for his source of power he would very soon
exhaust the supply but of the three states of matter to be
used for the development of power aud the exercise of force and
pressure often of enormous amount curiously enough man has to
utilize the invisible light and tenuous gaseous form of matter

  this form of matter is without tensile strength and is almost
indefinitely compressible we live in an atmosphere of gas for
air is a mixture of gases aud seems the least likely thing
imaginable as an instrument for exercising power or force it
is really curious to follow out what this light invisible gaseous
thing docs under proper conditions

  going back some two thousand years we are told that nero
of alexandria devised the first steam engine hia boiler was
mounted so that it could turn and when heat was applied and
steam pressure produced one or more pipes leading from the
boiler permitted steam to escape tangentially so that the whole
thing boiler and all whirled around at a great rate so we sec
that mankind long ago grasped the idea that a light invisible
gas could be made to develop power for steain is a true gas
is a little over half as heavy as air and is just as invisible

  to propel projectiles for hunting or for war tlie muscular
strength of man was first used in throwing the javelin in
shooting the arrow from the bow in projecting stones by hand
or by sling and by throwing clubs and boomerangs then when
bigger projcctilcs were thrown as in attacking cities and
fortresses machines were made which could throw large stones
in the construction of which mechanical means were employed

  but the art of killing your fellowman and destroying his
structures received its greatest perfection when instead of
muscles instead of mechanical means gas was used to send
projcctilcs out into spacc the bullets of rifles the shells of
cannon some of which in the world war were thrown a
distance of seventy five miles rising to a height of twenty-four
miles in their flight are all discharged by gas reaching their
destination shells which may be a foot and a half in diameter
are exploded with tlie most destructive cifects by the simple
expansion of gas within them

  a boat may be rowed or paddled by hand by giving ita sail 
we say the wind blows it along but the action of the wind on
a sail is simply the pressure of gas against the sail for air is a
perfect gas in former days a sailing vessel that would cross
the atlantic in two weeks acquired a celebrity for speed now

a steamer goes across in about five days driven by enormous en-
gines and their power is due purely and simply to the pressure
of gas against the pistons of the cylinders or against the wings
or buckets of turbines in turbines we are coming back in a sense
to heros engine of twenty centuries ago all engines steam
engines or internal combustion engines operate purely and
simply by gas pressure by pressure of the one kind of element
which seems utterly unadapted to exercise such force the
pressure used in tlie steam engine of its various types is due to
gas in the internal combustion engine such as is used in
automobiles the pressure is produced by exploding a mixture
of air and gasoline vapor in the cylinder the explosion takes
place with great readiness because of the large quantity of
hydrocarbon gas mixed with the air to at least start the ex-
plosion whose heat converts instantly the rest of the gasoline
spray into the form of gas so that it will burn with such readi-
ness as to constitute an explosion and here we come to a
curious thing

  the explosion of hydrocarbon gases under various condi-
tions involving of course the ignition of a mixture of a com-
bustible with air may be very violent and may be simulated by
mixing a very finely divided combustible powder with air the
fine division of the combustible giving it a certain approxima-
tion to the gaseous state we have explosions in flour mills
where the air charged with dust forms an explosive mixture
it is even said that the diesel engine which burns heavy oil
can be driven by dust fuel so that one might drive a ship across
the ocean using barrels of flour instead of gallons of oil which
is certainly a rather amusing suggestion but the pressure to
drive the engine would be that of gas produced by the com-
bustion of the finely divided solid

  gunpowder whether the old-fashioned black mechanical
mixture of carbon sulphur and the villainous saltpeter or the
modern chemical compounds all depend ior their action upon
the production of gas and this invisible light substance ab-
solutely without strength of any sort develops power and force
which can produce the most appalling effects it is almost a
contradiction of mechanics that such a thing as gas can do
what it does in the way of developing the most intense strains
and forces known to mankind

  it may seem to be a side issue but gas is used to cut great
steel beams and other steel and iron forms the little gas
blowpipe produces intense heat but this is not enough to cut
steel but by giving an excess of oxygen to the blowpipe jet an
oxidizing flame is produced when this impinges on iron or
steel it burns it literally converting the surface into fusible
magnetic oxide which as fast as produced flows away like a
liquid exposing a fresh surface and more iron is burned
through in this way a channel is cut through the heaviest
beam in a few minutes the blowpipe can even cut steel deep
down under water 

  in the competition between the airplane and dirigible the
advocates of the plane may exult in not requiring gas but
it is the air which is a gas which supports them they arc
upheld by the pressure of a gas a partial vacuum is pro-
duced on the upper surface of the wing and the unbalanced
pressure on the lower surfacc supports the plane

 
      and now though it outraged
common sense    though my mind
could not fully grasp the actuality the
impossible had occurred and we were
in the presence of the mysterious invis-
ible phenomenon

vortex

by a hyatt verrill

author of the astounding discoveries of dr mentiroso  into the green prism etc

illustrated by morey

    fj- hat is gravitation where does the earths gravitation cease does it
    rr end abruptly-as though there were a gravitational wall to shut it in at
    some certain distance from our earth in short ishat do we know about gravi-
    iation very little except its effects its cause may be defined as the presence of
    matter but why does matter produce it it may he that if ever we find out
    what it is all about some effective method for annihilating gravitation may be
    found on the other hand it may be that the secret of gravitation may be dis-
    covered only after some annihilating process is found mr verrill gives us here
    an extraordinary tale deeding with this theme in which he tells about vortices
    that develop a strange phenomenon-the local annihilation of gravitation and
    he gives us ingenious suggestions that simulate plausibility and proof

a dual personality

though we may not always realize the
fact men with dual personalities are many
not necessarily jekyll and hyde characters
yet men with two natures as distinct and op-
posed to each other as were the two sides of
the famed doctor jekyll many a man counted by those
who know him best as miserly and selfish secretly gives
great fortunes to charit many a man who professes
to be an agnostic or even an atheist contributes to mis-
sions and builds churchcs and many an old rounder who
spends nights in riotous living is a staid dry-as-dust
scientist in his home town or among those who know him
indeed i truly believe that every man and woman pos-
sesses this duality of personalities-that in all of us there
is a constant struggle for supremacy between two indi-
vidualities and that it is only a matter of degree or per-

haps of self-control or maybe fear that differentiates
those whose one personality dominates and those whose
two personalities have equal play

  such a man was my old friend sir esme mcdonald
to the world at large to the press even to the majority
of his most intimate friends and most certainly to liis
matter-of-fact business associates sir esme was a mil-
lionaire dilettante a good sportsman a high-living
scotch laird with thousands of acres of shooting in the
trossachs a castle near wirling a fine ocean-going
steam yacht on the clyde a hunting and a manor-house
in the midlands and an ugly curtain-windowed mansion
just off berkeley square

  a fine figure of a man well over six feet broad-shoul-
dercd sturdy as one of his own beeches florid-faced
active energetic keen-cycd-sir esme was the best type
of briton reserved hospitable with the easy quiet assur-
ance that only generations of breeding can produce in-
tense in his likes and his dislikes a steadfast friend and
with his intimates loquacious enthusiastic and unrc-




amazing stories

served yet i doubt if among all his friends there were
more than a dozen who knew or suspected anything of his
other personality and i am sure that aside from myself
not three of sir esmes most intimate friends-no not
even members of his own family-were aware of the
prominent place he occupied in the scientific world the
remarkable discoveries he had made the innumerable
monographs and scientific articles he had written nor that
sir esme mcdonald bart was identical with alexander
macdonald the internationally known scientist

   one might have visited his scotch castle his midlands
home his london rcsidcnce and nowhere from cellars
to roofs have found a trace of any scientific instruments
scientific books of any object that would have led one to
suspect that the millionaire sporting laird was the least
bit interested in anything save shooting hunting golf
fishing horse racing and yachting the books that filled
the shelves of his libraries were the most expensive first
editions and editions de luxe his galleries were hung
with priceless paintings by the most famous of old mas-
ters and modern artists there were prints of sporting
sccnes wild animal trophies yachting polo racing and
hunting cups and ribbons mounted heads of deer ante-
lope wild goats buffalo ibex and countless other antlered
and horned beasts stuffed record-breaking salmon trout
and deep-sea fish there were albino pheasants grouse
capercailzie and other game birds hi cases but never a
retort a telescope a microscope nor an electrical or chem-
ical device was in evidence

  yet tucked away in an old georgian house off earls
court was perhaps the most perfectly equipped physical
chemical and electrical laboratory in the british empire
the upper story housed three magnificent telescopes with
complete astronomical photographic apparatus celestial
charts and every appliance known to modern astrono-
mers-as well as to the ancients-with many that no one
aside from their owner and inventor had ever seen and
here-when sir esme disappeared from his castle his
city home or his business for days or weeks as he often
did or when he vanished for a night alexander mac-
donald might be found working over some new theory
carrying on involved and bewildering experiments in
physics or chemistry or studying the heavens

  why sir esme should have taken me into his confi-
dence as he took few others i cannot say with certainty
possibly it was because being an american he felt that
my status was different from that of any british friend
perhaps it was because of my extremely liberal views on
much mooted scientific questions or again it may have
been because we were mutual friends of dr thomson
who i believe shared sir esmes secret but i prefer
to think that it was solely because sir esme had implicit
faith and trust in me and-i say it without egotism-
because from the moment we met there sprang up a
most intimate and delightful friendship

   tf there is anything in the theory of auras or of mag-
netism between fellow men then most assuredly sir
esmes and my auras must have blended perfectly for
never have i taken such an instantaneous liking for any
man and as he himself admitted sir esme took as great
and as unaccountablc a liking for me yet it was a long
time after we first met before he revealed the fact that
he led a dual life and that he was to the scientific world
alexander macdonald possibly he might never have let
me into his secret had we not during a conversation
touched on a matter on which we both held very unor-

thodox views as it was not a scientific matter and has
nothing to do with this story there is no occasion for
going into details suffice it to say that sir esme held
very pronounced views in the course of the argument-
in which however we agreed in many ways-he let slip
a hint of a profound scientific knowledge that amazed
me in fact  expressed my amazement that he whose
interests were so far outside those of scientists should
quote science and should be so familiar with matters usu-
ally known only to them he seemed a bit put out for
a moment flushed stammered and then with a hearty
laugh declared he would astonish me still more if on an
appointed evening i would call at a certain house in
earls court

  needless to say when i was admitted by a sphinx-
faced gray-haired butler and led to a library or study that
was redolent of science i found sir esme in person
no i cannot say in person for he seemed to have altered
his appearance with his personality no longer was he
the blufl out-of-doors sportsman or the immaculately
clad clubman instead i saw a dignified scrious-faeed
man with slightly stooping shoulders clad in a denim
smock with low-toned voice who appeared far more like
a college professor than a hard-riding hard-shooting
scotch laird

of our first evening together or of many subsequent
evenings that we spent in his laboratories or his
observatory there is no need to speak other than to state
that i found the scientist alexander macdonald one of
the most remarkable of men and possessing a most pro-
found knowledge of nearly every branch of science
astronomy was a hobby chemistry a fad physics a
means to an end but his obsession was electro-magnetism
or to be exact a force which he claimed to have discov-
ered and which had been confused with electro-mag-
netic force by all other investigators as he put it in
trying to make his meaning clear to me the new force
bore much the same relation to electro-magnetic force as
radium bears to uranium and according to his theory
as borne out by his exhaustive researches and experi-
ments this force which lie alone had isolated was the
fundamental force that controlled the universe

  it is he declared long after our first meeting the
force that since the days of newton has been errone-
ously called gravitation scientists for years have been
endeavoring to fit sir isaacs theory to actual facts or
vice versa hut without success hundreds-i might even
say thousands of theories have been advanced yet
in every case these theories have failed to explain every
condition all have been wrong yet in a measure-in
some respects-all have been right for the fact remains
that there is such a tiling as gravitation yet as man has
been groping in the dark he has been woefully handi-
capped and as is the case in so many branches of science
he has deduced theories to fit his own ideas or assump-
tions why my dear sir consider how universal is the
belief that the solar system is built up on a basis of the
attraction of gravitation that should our earth-any of
the planets in fact-move within the so-called radius of
the suns gravitational attraction we or they would be
drawn to the sun that an object projected into space
beyond the earths- gravitational puli would fly let us
say to the moon yet can anyone any scientist offer a
rational common sense explanation of why the various
planets remain at their exact and proper distances apart 
the non-gravitational vortex



can anyone give a sane and sensible reason for the
heavenly bodies rotating and following their orbits with-
out being drawn together  can anyone explain why
the supposed attraction of our earth remains constant
at any height from its surface that man has ever at-
tained he laughed where may we ask these theo-
rists does tlie earths gravitation cease does it end
abruptly-like a gravitational wall-at some certain dis-
tance from our earth does the man the object that
drops from a balloon or an airplane at twenty thousand
feet in air drop any more slowly does he feel less
gravitational pull than if he dropped from a height of
five hundred or one hundred feet

  i confess i could find no reply to these posers but not
being an expert in physics and never having given much
thought to the phenomenon of gravitation i could do
little more than listen and admit my ignorance as well as
my open mind

  but as we became better acquainted and as sir esine
no alexander gained more confidence and found an out-
let for his pent-up and restrained scientific ardor in talk-
ing with me i became not only intensely interested but
absolutely amazed and who could avoid being amazed
if he should see a lump of lead when tossed in air remain
poised midway between floor and ceiling no more
if he should actually see the metal move up and down
to right or left at will and yet precisely that feat i
witnessed with my own eyes in my friends laboratory

  but good lord t exclaimed youve conquered the
air if you can do that you can build an airship that will 
float anywhere that can move in any direction that can-
not fall why on earth dont you make practical use of
your discovery why not give it tn the world

  he smiled and shook his head no he declared
you are mistaken and instead of benefiting the world
my discovery if made public at this time might result
in irreparable damages-perhaps even in the annihilation
of mankind t have not conquered the air as you put it
 have merely discovered the force that controls gravi-
tation i--

  but i objected i have always understood that if
it were possible to overcome gravitation to the extent of
permitting a body to remain suspended in space it would
only be necessary to let the earth rotate on its axis while
the floating object remained stationary in order to travel
at a speed of approximately one thousand miles an hour
without means of propulsion

  sir esmc-no alexander macdonald-burst into a
peal of laughter what tommy-rot he cried good
naturedly in the first place my friend the object-let
us say the machine-even if relieved of the effect or
partially relieved of the effect of gravitation would still
be in the earths atmosphere and as the atmosphere
rotates with the earth your floating airship would move
with tlie air and would remain poised over the same spot

on the earths surface and-

  but suppose it floated in space-above the atmos-
phere  i argued

  he snorted a bit contemptuously even if that were
possible-which it is not owing to a dozen reasons i
could present-your machine would not remain poised
and stationary while the earth revolved beneath it that
is not unless the gravitation was cut off over the entire
surface of tlie earth in which case everything would fly
off and join your floating ship and that my friend is
why i say my discovery might prove a curse instead of

a blessing i can eliminate or perhaps better counteract
the gravitation for as a matter of fact the force i have
isolated acts from the outer space downward or rather
inward instead of from the earth outward as everyone has
assumed i can i say manipulate this force to a certain
extent as far as it affects any small body of certain sub-
stances among which is lead possibly i can best make
my meaning clear by comparing my newly discovered
force to a beam of light

  by means of a convex lens a beam of sunlight may be
concentrated upon an object-let us say a bit of lead-
so that the metal will melt yet outside that concentrated
beam the sunlight has no such effect upon other bits of
lead in other words by means of my apparatus i can
prevent a ray or a beam of force from acting upon a
certain object although everywhere about it-outside the
sphere of effect of my apparatus-the force remains
unchanged and objects remain in silu and above a cer-
tain distance from the earths surface my apparatus fails
to control the force just as the lens would fail to concen-
trate the light beam beyond its proper and established
focus

  mmra i mused i think i understand but i saw
you move the lead to right and left why cant you
cany it a bit farther and move it to any extent and
why shouldnt your apparatus be set up in an airship and
thus be used to nullify gravitation as it proceeds even if
it were compelled to remain at a fixed distance above the
earth

  sir esme smiled condescendingly all very well in
theory he said but not in practice the effect of my
device is-well i might say to create a hole in the gravi-
tational force if the apparatus were placed in a vessel
as you suggest this hole would extend not only down-
ward towards the earth but upward as well and the result
would be that your ship and its apparatus would remain
in statu quo in other words the reversed effect on one
side would counteract the effect on the opposite side in
fact i am not at all sure that the object might not be
completely disintegrated i must try that experiment
no my dear sir in order to operate my device must be
placed on the surface of the earth and even then it must
be insulated by means of an alloy i have discovered and
like many inventions and discoveries this one is only
successful on a small scalc i can raise that half pound
piece of lead as you see but i cannot budge a mass
weighing ten pounds

  why cant you increase the power of your machine
in proportion to the weight of the object i asked him

  he shook his head no use he declared positively
ive tried it and it doesnt work no the whole thing
is in its experimental stage and its a beastly dangerous
thing to experiment with unless the greatest care is used
if it were made public some consummate ass might suc-
ceed in eliminating gravitation over a considerable
area think of the result in that case

  well its darned-weird-downright uncanny i said
staring at the bit of lead still poised midway between the
table and ceiling and it seems to me there must be
some use-some value to it

  eventually perhaps he agreed but it would amaze
you and many other laymen if you knew how many aston-
ishing scientific discoveries are made which are relegated
to the limbo of forgotten things merely because they can-
not be put to any useful or valuable purpose i could
name dozens in fact t have personally made dozens of


amazing

stories

such discoveries but mainly they are made by scien-
tists employed by commercial firms who take no interest
in any scientific discovery that fails to fulfill their require-
ments

  yes i observed i suppose thats true ive heard
others say the same thing but it seems to me this is a
really big an astonishing tiling -and you said yourself
it upset all existing theories and might revolutionize phys-
ics and other sciences

  he nodded quite so he agreed but-with a
sigh-what use is revolution unless something is gained
thereby however- he paused and gazed contem-
platively at the floating picce of lead-somehow i have
a feeling a hunch as you americans would express it
that there is something back of it that i am on the eve of
a great discovery a great truth that will startle the
world

  i laughed

  i should say that the discovery you have already
made is quite startling enough  told him

chapter ii

harvey an enigma

sir esmes lapses into his scientific personality
were very irregular and often for weeks at a time
the earls court laboratory was dark and deserted
and to all intents and purposes alexander macdonald
ceased to exist again sir esme mcdonald would van-
ish quite as completely as if the earth had swallowed him
up and for days or weeks lie would be lost to the world
as he buried himself in his scientific researches as i
never knew when he would be at his laboratory and as
i had no wish to intrude myself upon him it had been
agreed that when he was in the earls court house and
wished my companionship lie would notify me among
his other idiosyncrasies was a detestation of the telephone
that amounted almost to a mania although for business
and other reasons phones were neccssary in his home or
rather in his various homes he never permitted the instru-
ments to be within his sight or hearing and never used
them himself

  it was a long time before i learned the reason for this
seemingly unreasonable prejudice against telephones and
i was at a total loss to account for such an apparently
ridiculous attitude on the part of a man of sir esmes
character and mentality until a mutual friend explained
sir esmes only son the heir to his fortune and his title
the baronet was a widower had been instantly killed
in an airplane accident and the tragic news had been
communicated to him by telephone the shock was of
course overwhelming and i could well understand why
after such a harrowing experience he could not bear the
instruments that were constant reminders of the tragedy
and i could not blame him for his attitude i mention
this fact because it had a rather important bearing on the
events that i am about to relate owing to this feeling
on the part of my friend it had been arranged that he
should communicate with me through his man harvey
the old and trusted retainer who had admitted me to the
earls court laboratory on the occasion of my first visit
to that place

  harvey was a most remarkable personage and as he
played an important role in our adventures a few words
in regard to him are essential

he was i should say a man of sixty about sir
esmes own age and had been picked up lashed to
a rude raft of wreckage in mid-ocean by sir esme who
was cruising on bis yacht when rescued the castaway
had been unconscious for days he had hovered on the
verge of death and when he eventually recovered his
health and strength his mind as far as his past was con-
cerned was a total blank he could not recall his own
name the name of the vessel that had gone down how
the accident occurred nor any other detail of the past in
vain sir esme and innumerable specialists tried to re-
store the mans lost memory to reawaken his mind to
him life began with the hour of his recovery aboard the
loch lovern sir esmes ocean-going yacht a splendid
five-masted bark for sir esme was a true sailor and had
no use for steam

  but that the man had been at sea or was a seaman was
soon evident he seemed instinctively to know the name
and location of every line sheet brace and halyard aboard
the yacht he could navigate and every now and then
flashes of past knowledge and experiences would come to
him surprising himself as much as others for example
on one occasion as the yacht was making a strange port
lie cautioned the sailing-master to keep a trifle more to
starboard as there was an unmarked rock on the port side
of the channel another time when running for shelter
under double-reefed topsails in a typhoon he declared
that a safe harbor and secure anchorage lay behind a
wooded point
at times also he exhibited a knowledge of matters
and of an education that had no place in a seaman or a
ships officer and that puzzled sir esme tremendously
not that he could converse on such matters nor discuss
them intelligently or at length they were mere flickers
unconscious or perhaps better subconscious glimmers of
things familiar to him in his former existence fleeting
memories gone almost as soon as they were formed the
naming of some strange bird beast or plant a reference
to some important date or event of the past a quotation
from some classic or poem the mention of some person
or place and on one occasion when sir esme was
puzzling over an abstruse mathematical problem of
astronomy the factor by which the problem was solved
he was in fact a man of mystery and sir esme as well
as harvey himself a name he had taken by choice had
devoted days and weeks to searching the lists of crews
and passengers on all vessels that had been wrecked or
reported missing at the time when he had been picked up
no one who answered harveys description had been
lost so far as could be determined and the only vessel
that had disappeared with all on board and of which 
complete list of passengers-if she carried any-and
crew was obtainable was the santa incs spanish vessel
plying between vigo and the canaries and which by no
possibility could have been within a thousand miles of
the spot where ilarvey had been found adrift upon his
bit of wreckage

  it is almost impossible for a normal man to fully realize
what harveys condition meant in life he was like an
infant transformed by magic to a fully developed man
like an untutored savage whisked by a miracle into the
midst of civilization everything even the commonest
everyday matters were to his mind absolutely new al-
though i must qualify that statement somewhat though
he could recall nothing of his past though his life and
world began-as far as his consciousness went- the
the non-gravitational vortex



loch lovern yet certain features of his past remained
he could read and write he spoke several european
languages fluently and in his educational attainments he
was the equal of the average high school boy but such
matters as well as his knowledge of everyday affairs
food clothcs behavior etc seemed instinctive so too
although he could not recall ever having seen them rail-
way trains motor cars all the modernities of our civiliza-
tion seemed perfectly natural to him but dates events
the world war the most important occurrences prior to
his rescue were absolutely unknown at first he had
been very sensitive in regard to his condition he had
avoided other men-though fairly worshiping sir esme
-and had consequently developed a taciturnity a shell
of aloofness of silence and of impassivity that sur-
rounded and enveloped him like a coat of mail even to
sir esme he was inarticulate

  he had insisted from the first upon being sir esmes
servant his very shadow it was hopeless for the baro-
net to attempt to dissuade him

  and as he was at a distinct disadvantage among the
other servants on sir esmes estate or in his various es-
tablishments the baronet hit upon the plan of taking him
into his confidence installing lum as the sole servant in
the secret laboratory and making ilarvey the valet but-
ler care-takcr guardian assistant and general factotum
of alexander macdonald

   he felt that with harvey the secret of his dual person-
ality was safe and harvey seemed lo accept the anoma-
lous condition of his master as perfectly natural he
never addressed the baronet or referred to him as sir
esme or my lord always it was sir or mr mac-
donald or mr alexander  and to sir esmes amaze-
ment harvey without any instructions or suggestions
had been perfectly at home among the delicate and com-
plicated scientific devices and apparatus in the laboratory
and observatory as though he had all his life been quite
accustomed to such things he knew the purpose the use
of everything aud when out of curiosity and as a test
the baronet-or as i should call him alexander-gave
him permission to make use of the equipment he dis-
covered to his utter astonishment that the memory-dead
man possessed a subconscious and quite inexplicable
knowledge of the sciences that was almost equal to his
own the tiling was the more amazing as harvey could
not himself give any explanation of why or how he did
this that or the other to him the word electron meant
nothing yet like an automaton or a man under hypnotic
influence he produced a device by which he secured a
photographic record of an electronic how on a metal disc
when sir esme-no alexander-mentioned the con-
stellation aries harveys face was a blank yet he readily
and unhesitatingly adjusted the telescope to precise po-
sition to bring aries into the field of vision

   he is the most amazing person in the world really
sir esme declared when he told me of harveys history
he must have been a man of the highest attainments in
general science yet as far as conscious knowledge is con-
cerned he is ignorant of the very rudiments of science
do you know i would really give a great deal if i pos-
sessed a knowledge of psychology so i could devote my-
self to studying him it is for all the world as if he were
living in a dream-acting moving carrying on while
asleep yet talking behaving living his ordinary life as
though wide awake

  but though i forbore to say so for i was not quite

sure of my friends psychological condition or his knowl-
edge of his own dual personality harvey to my mind
was no greater mystery than his master the one pos-
sessed two distinct personalities each conscious while
the other possessed two egos the one conscious and the
other sub-conscious for that matter i was not and
even yet am not quite sure if the baronet was fully con-
scious of the existence of his two selves never while
he was alexander macdonald did he refer to sir esme
mcdonald save as another and wholly distinct individual
even when he was telling me of harveys history he did
not speak in the first person but narrated the story ex-
actly as if telling of some other mans experiences he
did not say i picked him up at sea he said he
was picked up by sir esme mcdonald and when my
friend was in the role of sir esme never did he refer
by so much as a word or a hint to alexander macdonald
the scientist so after all perhaps of the two men
sir esme was the most amazing

  but to go back to where i stated that it had been
agreed that sir esme-yes i shall refer to him as sir
esme-was to notify me that he would welcome my com-
pany at his laboratory

  it was several weeks after i had witnessed his amazing
experiment with the bit of lead when harvey rang my
bell and announced that mr alexander wished to see
me at the earls court house

  very well ilarvey i said tell him ill be over in
an hour or so i have an appointment to meet some
friends leaving victoria station at ten then ill go
direct to the laboratory

  harvey hesitated a moment his sphinx-like face be-
traying nothing then with a typical butlers cough i
beg your pardon sir he said but i would suggest
that you should come at once sir i-well sir to tell the
truth mr alexander seemed greatly excited sir and
most anxious for you to join him at the earliest possible
opportunity sir i trust you will not consider me pre-
sumptuous sir but if you could find it convenient to see
my master first sir and to keep your appointment later
sir  would advise it sir

  now never before had harvey made such a long
speech never had he offered a suggestion as to my or
sir esmes actions and i felt sure that some most impor-
tant matter indeed must be afoot to have caused him
to speak as he had so filled with intense curiosity to
learn what had excited my friend and why my presence
was so essential i scrapped all my prearranged plans
stopped only long enough to phone my departing friends
that t would be unable to see them off and with harvey
hurried to the earls court laboratory

chapter iii

positive signs of success

harvey had not exaggerated sir esme was
more than excited in fact for a moment i
feared that something serious had happened
that he was ill or deranged he was wild-eyed his hair
was dishevelled and he was pacing nervously excitedly
up and down the hallway puffing furiously at a huge
pipe and muttering exclaiming to himself but at my
entrance he wheeled his eyes lit up with pleased recog-
nition the next instant he was almost forcing me down
the hallway and into his library

stories

  thank heaven youre here he cried it id been
compelled to keep this to myself much longer i would
have gone mad i must tell someone and youre the only
one i could think of could depend upon could trust
by gad no one else would believe it but you- he
laughed hoarsely-youre no scientist so youll believe
your mind is open-free of hide-bound prejudice yet
i cant yet believe it myself its too big it has too many
possibilities and-damn it all its too uncanny

  each moment he was getting more and more excited
while excitement in some men might seem quite natural
in the case of sir esme the most unemotional unex-
citable man i had ever known this feverish nervous
excitement seemed almost terrible

  what is it whats the trouble i asked him
he laughed hoarsely almost i might say drunkenly
i hardly dare tell even you he declared it sounds
too preposterous and when i have told you and if you
believe it you wont wonder im almost mad in fact i
do not blame you in the least if you think i am mad
then with a great effort calming himself it has to do
with that same force he said ive been experimenting
testing but it was harvey who gave me the real idea the
real suggestion-harvey and you my friend really i

take no crcdit whatever for it i-

  the old story of fools rushing in eh i laughed

  not fools he retorted harveys no fool and-

  i am i interrupted

  he chuckled in the old way and i thanked heaven his
unnatural excitement had vanished not a bit of it by
jove he declared the scientists are the fools but
seriously do you recall your remarks about my discov-
ery about objects flying oil into space and so on

   nodded

  and do you remember that t stated that i could lift
an object only a certain distance that i could lift only
objects of definite weights  that my apparatus operated
upon or repelled the force for only a certain distance
and over a definite restricted area

  again i assented

  i was the fool he exclaimed but ilarvey brought
me to my senses he was watching my experiments and
muttered as if to himself vortex what do you mean
i demanded poor ilarvey winked his eyes gulped and
seemed to come out of a trance he didnt even know
hed spoken then suddenly like an inspiration it came
to me vortex whirlpools whirlwinds like a flash
i understood the force i had discovered the force that
was the real source of gravitation when repelled by my
device acted like a vortex-a whirlpool-but a reversed
vortex do you understand  do you see  my instru-
ment represented the apex the point of the vortex a
disturbance of the force that spread out like a cone as it
ascended like-well like any other ray like the beam
thrown by a searchlight you remember i compared my
force to a beam of light when i showed you the floating
piece of lead- he laughed-but i liad  idea no con-
ception at that time of the exactness of my simile and
just as a ray a beam of light-for that matter just as
sound-thins out becomes weak in ratio to the square
of the length of its radius from its origin so this force
 the area-the base of the inverted cone of influence-
ot the interrupted force i created became thinner
fainter less powerful in ratio to the square of the dis-
tance from its origin and its angle of-well i might say
locus no wonder my lead rose to a definite height and

remained there no wonder i could not lift an object

exceeding a certain weight i-

  hold on i ejaculated youre getting too involved
for me to follow i grasp the cone idea but i dont see
why if you used greater power or force or a larger appa-
ratus or whatever you may call it the cone or vortex
would not be proportionately increased in force and
lienee a larger weight would be lifted to a greater height
ah but my dear sir that was just the trouble cried
sir esme when i increased my power as you call it
i merely created a more widely diffused disturbance of
the force it was analogous to using a more powerful
light in the searchlight but also using a wider distribut-
ing lens there is greater light to be sure but it is
spread by the lens to a wider angle and throws a beam no
farther than the smaller light with die smaller lens

 shook my head in despair now let me get this
straight i begged him one moment you com-
pare your force no the area wherein the force is nulli-
fied to a vortex or a cone but the next moment you state
that the objects affected rise or move away from the apex
of the vortex i thought in the case of vortices every-
thing was drawn from the edges into the apex

  sir esme gazed at me pityingly and i knew he thought
me the fool he had once denied me to be but he was
very patient now that he had relieved his pent-up feelings
by discussing the matter with me

  i didnt intend to convey the idea that the affected
area-the force-vacuum as i might express it was ro-
tating whirling like a true vortex he explained i
have no reason to assume or to think that there is any
such movement taking place no the very reverse is the
case the object affected is the moving object have
you-of course you must have witnessed the feat of a
motorcyclist driving at top speed around and around the
interior of an inverted conical track or to put it even
more simply you know that a sharp curve on a road
should always be banked you must be familiar with so-
called centrifugal forces the tendency of a moving object
to slide off to one side when traveling in a circle that
is what occurs when i operate my repelling device the
object affected races about the invisible circumference
of the inverted cone of forcc-vacuum and so mounts up-
ward just as the motorcyclist rises swiftly towards the

top of his conical enclosure but-

  but- i interrupted him the lead most certainly
did not move it remained stationary it rose straight
up

  i beg your pardon but it most assuredly did not
he declared to your eyes to mine it appeared to do
so but the human eye is incapable of registering motion
beyond a certain-and very moderate-speed just as the
human ear cannot register seund above or below certain
limits of vibratory waves you mean to say- i
began but he checked me with a gesture

  exactly he cried you cannot see a rifle ball
passing through the air you cannot distinguish the in-
dividual spokes of a rapidly moving wheel yet you must
have observed that in motion pictures the spokes of a
wheel on a moving motor car often appear to be sta-
tionary or to move in-the reverse direction and if a
disk or a ball is rotated extremely rapidly no human eye
can determine whether it is stationary or is rotating in

this case-

  granted that i might not detect its motion if rotating
the non-gravitattonal vortex



on its own axis i assuredly would have seen it ii it had
moved about the circumference of the cone-like area i
argued for had it moved about with sufficient speed to
have rendered its travel invisible the object itself would
have been invisible

   sir esme chuckled your reasoning- is remarkable
 for a non-scientific man he told me but you forget
 or perhaps i forgot to state that the cone of force-
 vacuum is so small-its diameter so small-that your
 argument docs not hold the diameter of the cone of
 affected space is at the limit reached by the object pre-
 cisely that of the object or at the most only slightly
 larger than the object itself the moment the object
 attains to that point it mounts no higher consequently
 as it races madly-probably thousands of times a second
 -around the circumference of a cone no larger than
 itself it practically rotates upon its own axis and hence
 to our eyes it appears to be stationary ah i know for
 i very foolishly touched the piece of lead while poised
 in air and the thing shot off with centrifugal forcc with
 the speed and power of a bullet why by jove it
 smashed two beakers to atoms and penetrated an inch
 of deals thank god it had the good sense to fly away
 from me or rny experiments would have ended then and
 there

   hmm i observed but why doesnt the thing rise
 higher-up to the limits of the cone of-er what you
 call force-vacuum 

   sir esme shook his head i am not quite certain
 myself he admitted but i think it is because the fric-
 tion or the resistance is greater than the lifting power of
 the affected area it is in a reverse way somewhat akin to
 the phenomenon of a falling body theoretically a fall-
 ing body should increase its speed as it drops-that is
 tlie farther it falls the faster it should fall hut as a matter
 of fact owing to friction and resistance of the atmos-
 phere its speed after a definite fall is reached remains
 constant but that my friend is where i have made the
 great discovery tire discovery that so excited me

   good lord i exclaimed i thought what you have
 just told me was the discovery you dont mean to tell
 me there is more coming

   this is merely the beginning he assured me the
 real discovery came through a device by which the focus
 if  may so term it of the repellent area was intensified-
 exactly as you or i or anyone can focus the lens of a lan-
 tern or a stereopticon and by increasing the focus or
 the intensity of my repellent beam as the object ascends
 i can send the thing racing upward for an indefinite dis-
 tance-for all i know into space itself

   then you could project a vessel or a device into
 space so the earth would rotate beneath it and the de-
 vice-the vessel-would in effect travel westward at
 one thousand miles an hour i exclaimed

   ko he declared that is impossible the repellent
 beam would have to follow the object to accomplish that
 and the beam is fixed-it is projected straight-radially
 from the earth and at right angles to the earths surface
 but- sir esme paused leaned forward and spoke im-
 pressively-i have discovered a most astonishing and
 yet logical thing if an object is lifted by my device to
 a great height alxve the earth it either completely van-
 ishes or returns to the earth at a spot some distance from
 where it started

   whati i ejaculated you mean you actually have
  well-er blown things into spaee

  i cannot positively say he replied but i do know
that in several instances objects fell back to earth sev-
eral feet-even a number of yards from the point where
i projected them while others projected to a greater
height have never returned

  i laughed pardon me i cried but that does not
prove that they actually vanished in fact your state-
ment that some fell back at a considerable distance from
where you sent them soaring indicates to my mind that
the others merely descended beyond your sight or hear-
ing but come where and when did you make these
tests im mighty sorry i could not have seen them

  lie grinned boyishly i-or rather we for i must
include harvey-conducted them on sir esme mc-
donalds property in yorkshire there is quite a large
lake in the midst of the moor-a lonely uninhabited
spot-and once i discovered that tlie objects did not re-
turn to their starting point i made use of the lake in
order if possible to determine if they descended near
and if so at what distances from the apparatus you
see i thought at first it might be tlie result of wind or
other simple causes but i soon determined to my en-
tire satisfaction that they fell always northwest of the
point of departure and that the distance varied in exact
ratio to the intensity of the nullifying beam employed

  so that proves my contention i interrupted those
that were sent highest fell proportionately farther away
and out of your range

  he shook his head i thought so myself-at first
lie said but the strange feature is this i adjusted-
or i might say graded-the focus so as to project the
objects in this case they were iron cubes higher and
higher by degrees in cach case the cubes fell back in
the proper ratio of distances until a ccrtain power or
focus was used whereupon none returned now my
dear sir you must admit that if it was simply a matter
of their falling so far distant that they were beyond our
ken there would have been intermediate falls just as
there were intermediate beams used and- sir esme
leaned forward and tapped my knee for emphasis-a
number of the cubes-those that fell farthest away-
were partially disintegrated-the comers the edges were
tom away i am sure-i feel positive that the speed
of rotation of the objects increases with the distance
reached above the earth and that at a certain distance
the rotation speed becomes so great that the objects are
completely disintegrated-blown to atoms no doubt
he continued various substances lose their cohesion at
various heights-they must of necessity as their tensile
strengths vary-and i intend to make exhaustive experi-
ments covering this feature

  he paused

  wonderful i declared but pardon me if i re-
mind you of it you stated that many wonderful discov-
eries possessed  real value and personally i cannot
see what value this discovery possesses if as you say a
thing is liable to go to pieces and the most that can be
done is to elevate an object and let it drop back to earth

  sir esme rose stuck his hands in his trousers pockets
puffed once or twice at his pipe and gazed steadily at
me from under knitted brows

  the value is he announced in level tones that the
discovery will unless i am vastly mistaken solve some
of the greatest mysteries that continue to confront the
human nice

chapter iv

explaining mysterious disappearances

for a moment i stared at him almost convinced
that he was not quite himself then i laughed
of course i exclaimed the mysteries of gravi-
tation of why things on this old earth stay put as i

might say the-

  nothing of that sort he interrupted impatiently-
mysteries of gravitation fiddlesticks the forcc itself
solves that no by gad what i mean are human mys-
teries-matters that touch us personally not any
abstruse scientific piffle but real vital human mysteries
such as-well the mystery of harvey for example

   was absolutely amazed thunderstruck to hear him
the intensely scientific student speaking so scathingly of
science to hear him rating human interests higher than
scientific truths and his reference to his discovery solv-
ing the mystery of harveys past i was by now almost
certain he had become mentally unbalanced oil the other
hand i thought it might be only the strain of hard work
plus the excitement over his discoveries he was not
the excitable sort and i had never before seen him in his
present obviously nervous and keyed-up state but then
such an epochal and revolutionary discovery as he had
made was enough to key anyone up to the highest pitch

  i confess i cannot conceive how your remarkable
discovery and your most recent- experiments have any
bearing on harveys case i said speaking as if discuss-
ing a most ordinary matter how can-

  but he did not wait for me to complete my question
of course you wouldnt he cried i didnt myself at
first but the reason it will solve the puzzle of his past-
just as it will solve other riddles other mysteries-is be-
cause it was the cause of them

  this was almost too much caused the lapse of har-
veys memory i ejaculated how can lhat be pos-
sible how can a force-a gravitational vacuum as
you call it-be responsible for the loss of a shipwrecked
mans memory do you mean lhat by some mysterious
means a human memory is whisked into space like your
iron cubes or is shattered into atoms

  he grinned and i thanked heaven for that grin for it
proved he was still sane and was not as nervously ex-
cited as i had thought

  no not quite that he replied bui- he moved
quickly to a chair seated himself at his littered desk and
readied for a sheet of pajer a pencil and a map that i
had noticed lying open on the desk just come here and
ill try to make it all clear to you he said in quite his
normal tones of course he added you think im
mad as a march hare and i cannot blame you but as
a matter of fact its all very simple-that is the solution
of the mysteries is simple i admit the confounded
force and the laws that govern il and the formation of
those vortices are the very reverse of simple but now
i have the key to them-the fundamental idea as it were
im positive i can work out the details but-well let
us start with harveys case you remember i told you
 picked him up at sea- i started involuntarily and
cast a covertglance at my friend for never before when
in his alexander macdonald ego had he referred to him-
self in the person of sir esme but he appeared oblivi-
ous of the slip and of my surprise for he was busy jot-
ting down figures and marking spots on the map

  i picked him up right here he continued yet as
you know i searched-all records and am positive that
no vessel was wrecked within hundreds of miles of the
spot-that is no vessel had been wrecked in that vicinity
at that time or near it and no vessel that by any possi-
bility could have been in the vicinity had been reported
as missing yet there he was floating lashed to a piece
of wreckage and unquestionably shipwrecked not more
than twenty hours previously-probably not more than
three or four hours

  yet- sir esme wheeled his eyes half-shut under
his bushy brows and his finger tapping out the words on
his palm yet i have every reason to think that harvey
as we know him was actually wrecked more than one
thousand miles distant from the spot where he was
picked tip

  what  ejaculated why why thats impossible
you say he could not have been in the sea more than a
few hours and it is manifestly ridiculous to believe he
could have drifted a thousand miles from-

  ridiculous impossible he cried interrupting my
words a short time ago if t told you i could utterly
eliminate the thing lcnown-as weight-that i could cause
a lump of lead or a piece of iron to move away from the
earth by the elimination of a force hitherto unknown you
would have declared my statements ridiculous and the
feat impossible now honestly am i not right

  i laughed yes i presume you are i admitted
but this well this is different

  is it he queried raising his eyebrows i do not
think so for i feel convinced that harvey was trans-
ported for more than one thousand miles by the same
means by which the cubes of iron used in my tests were
shot into the air and transported for considerable dis-
tances in other words my friend i believe that in
nalurp under certain conditions in certain places and-
thank god-very rarely gravitational vortices are
formed precisely like those my apparatus produces but
on a far larger scale t do not pretend nor attempt to
explain why or how these are formed i do not have
the faintest conception of why they should occur what
produces them why they are not more common but i
do know that they do occur and i base that assumption
on two basic facts first what i know of the phenomena
i have artificially produced and second because there is
no other plausible theory to explain certain occurrences
that we know take place and have taken place for ages-
as far back as there is history you liave heard of the
mystery of the marie celeste he demanded suddenly-
altering his tone and abruptly changing the subject

  i nodded certainly i replied the vessel-a
bark i believe-that was found with all sails set her
boats at the davits everything in order on board but
without the trace of a living soul

  and no plausible explanation of the mystery he
observed well by jove the gravitational vortex ex-
plains that mystery and it explains scores of others-
the showers of fishes of frogs so widely reported whirl-
winds tornadoes watcr-spouts it explains the baffling
but authenticated showers of stones in the west indies
and elsewhere it explains the mysterious the inexplicable
and yet unquestionable disappearances of human be-
ings-the bodily vanishing of men and women it ex-
plains many of the seeming miracles of biblical and other
history the missing ships and- lie leaned forward and
spoke earnestly impressively-it explains something
the non-gravitational vortex



that affects us of today more closely far more vitally
-the tragedies of the air-the airplanes that have
vanished leaving no trace on transoceanic flights
the- his voice broke-the crashes without ap-
parent reasons that have caused the-the deaths of
so many gallant and splendid young men

for a moment he was silent a pained expression
on his face and i knew that his thoughts were of
his lost son and then suddenly his face cleared and
to my amazement my utter astonishment it was sir
esme and not the scientifically inclined alexander
who was speaking

   my dear friend he said all the years that i
have spent in scientific research have been with this
one object in view long before that tragedy of
my life of which i cannot even now bear to speak
or even think i became obsessed with the idea of
solving what are to me the most mysterious occur-
rences that ever have taken place never have i
believed in the supernatural and i have always felt
convinced that there was nothing that could not be
explained by natural causes provided we understand
those causes

  as sir esme mcdonald it would have been im-
possible for me to have turned to scientific work and
to have been taken seriously yet i longed to delve
into the mysteries of research so i invented alex-
ander macdonald the scientist and- he smiled and
his eyes twinkled-so thoroughly did i become
alexander or perhaps i should say so thinly ve-
neered was alexander by sir esme that hi time i
became to all intents and purposes two distinct
personalities but now now that i am on the verge
of solving those mysteries which have always in-
terested me sir esme and alexander must merge
for the work  have in view can only be carried on
by means of sir esmes wealth and alexanders
scientific knowledge combined he laughed by
gad he cried i believe youre the only man who
ever saw two men become one

  or one man become two i observed but
frankly though i am of course quite willing to be
convinced i do not even yet understand how this
force you have discovered or the absence of the
force-and by the way why not call it esmeism-
how this esmeism or its absence can account for -all
the phenomena or the puzzles you have mentioned
fine he ejaculated youve found a name
for the force and as it was not discovered by sir
esme but by the studious alexander i can accept
your name for it without feeling egotistical but
seriously my friend cannot you see how simple it
is  for some reason as yet inexplicable an esme-
ismic vacuum-jove what an expression-takes
place over a certain spot on the surface of the earth
or sea and instantly everything in the area of that
vortex of non-attraction-no by gad of repulsion
to the planets surface flies away from the earth
i can understand that i admitted but if for

mwell its downright uncanny  
said staring at the bit of lead still
poised midway between the table and
ceiling


amaziivg stories

the sake of argument such a vacuum or vortex
happened to occur where a ship was afloat the entire
vessel would disappear whereas as in the case of the
marie celeste only the persons aboard were missing
and also why would the earth or the water not follow 
sir esme shook his head as if in despair dont you
remember he queried that i explained that the weight
of the object lifted or moved depended upon the size of
the area where the force-no confound it the esmeism
was absent or interrupted the effect is precisely as if
a magnet were suspended above a bit of iron or steel
the larger the magnet the larger the piece of metal it can
lift or perhaps i might better say for purposes of expla-
nation that the same magnet that would lift twenty
pounds if within a few inches of the object would not
move that object if separated from it by a few feet or
again i might compare the area of eliminated esmeism
to a beam of light as i have done before a beam of
light may be focussed to a point upon an object or it
may be widely diffused over the same place and so it is
in the case of these inverted cone-shaped areas or vor-
tices of atmosphere freed by some unknown means of
the force that is called gravitation but with a great dif-
ference whereas the diffused light is less powerful than
the concentrated light the reverse is the case with esme-
ism see- he sketched rapidly upon a sheet of paper-
here we have two inverted cones one with its apex just
touching a plane the other like an inverted truncated
cone with a considerable portion of its section touching
the same plane you readily see that in the first case
only those objects directly under the apex of the cone
would fly upwards whereas in the second place all the
objects that came within the area of the truncated cones
section would be affected

  now in my experiments i have always necessarily
been operating with a vortex whose apex represented my
apparatus and hence only very small objects directly in
line with tlie apex were affected but in nature in the
rase of the phenomena that i am sure occur a consid-
erable area may be affected and hence large-extremely
cumbersome objects such as entire ships may be relieved
of all-well gravitation as it is called and unques-
tionably in nature as in my experiments the force or
rather the absence of force must vary

  but i objected although i can quite understand
all that yet i cannot understand how a mystery such as
that of the murie celeste or of harvey or even the dis-
appearance of a single human being can be explained
by your theory

  theory bosh he exclaimed impatiently its not
a theory its a demonstrable fact and why pray are
not those mysterious occurrences explicable by it
well i said im not a scientist as you know sir
esme but it seems to me that in any of the cases i
mentioned or in any similar case the results do not fit
the cause if i may put it in that way for example the
mane celeste was in perfect condition not a thing dis-
turbed aside from the fact that all human beings were
missing and in the case of a man or woman vanish-
ing-as many have i admit-how could one individual
be whisked away from a populated spot without others
being disturbed without someone witnessing the marvel-
ous occurrence and without the victim making an outcry
and as far as whirlwinds-tornadoes-waterspouts
showers of fish and such things are concerned why they
have been otherwise explained long ago

  sir esme burst into hearty laughter of course they
have he cried so has the matter of gravitation of
volcanic eruptions of sun-spots of electro-magrfetic
force and scores of others but do you does anyone
recall a single explanation that has not upset some prior
explanation that had been accepted as incontrovertible
fact not a bit of it man puzzles over some phenome-
non in nature he manufactures a theory an explanation
that seems to fit the facts and until some other man dis-
covers the truth-or hatches a more plausible theory-
everyone swallows it and is satisfied

  because an apple fell on sir isaac newtons head
his curiosity was aroused apples all other objects
dropped towards the earth so naturally-he and his fol-
lowers-argued that everything must be attracted by the
earth and they christened this purely theoretical attrac-
tion gravitation but it never occurred to any of them
that the same results would follow if the objects were
impelled or pressed towards the earth from outer space
no indeed because man-yes even scientific man-can-
not readily conceive of anything earthly being subject to
ex-terrestrial forces everyone looked to poor old earth
for the source of the force that caused the apple to fall
but that does not answer your questions your doubts
can you not conceive how if you if i were walking
along or standingstill or were sitting here and one of
those inverted vortices of interrupted force-no esme-
ism-should by chance form directly above you so that
its apex was poised directly over your head you would
be sucked up as it were without in the least affecting

me here within a few feet of you and--

  yes yes i interrupted glancing unconsciously up-
ward as if half-fearing the tragedy might be hovering
over me but would not my chair the rug the floor even
the earth directly underneath also fly upward

sir esme shook his head  not necessarily he
declared if the apex of the vortex as i must call
it-though it is not a true vortex-if the point the focal
point as i may say was upon you nothing beneath you
would be disturbed any more than a beam of light con-
centrated upon a sheet of paper and burning a hole
through the paper would burn objects beneath it and out
of tlie focus of the light beam but should the apex of
the vortex be beneath you then my friend you your
chair everything movable within the area of interrupted
esmeism would as you say go soaring upward

  id get a nasty blimp when i struck the ceiling i
observed or would a section of the ceiling and roof
vanish and leave a clear exit for me 

  no that is a rather remarkable feature of the thing
he replied only movable matter appears to be affected
as long as any object is attached or fixed to another ob-
ject outside the sphere of the vacuum if i may so refer

to it it remains in situ i-

  but surely if a ship-if a large heavy body would fly
off the earths surface mere nails screws bolts or other
fixtures could not hold things in place i objected

  it is not the strength of the fixtures he said slowly
and thoughtfully i have carried out some rather inter-
esting tests to determine that yes by jove damnably
interesting aud devilishly mystifying with my device
for creating a small area of esmeism i could lift lead
iron any material until it came into contact with some
fixed object there it stopped and-well this is the
most amazing-but hold on come into the laboratory
the non-gravitational yortex



and ill demonstrate it ill show you something that will
make everything yon have seen- or that i have said ap-
pear commonplace and simple

  rising he led the way into the room where i had first
witnessed his astonishing demonstration and having ad-
justed and arranged his apparatus i again gazed almost
as incredulously as on my first visit at the piece of metal
that floated light as thistledown into the air but this
time instead of remaining poised it shot with ever in-
creasing speed upward struck the ceiling with a resound-
ing noise rebounded swung up again and finally came to
rest against the ceiling where it remained as if glued in
place

  you observe remarked sir esme that despite the
fact that the esmeism-free area extends above the ceil-
ing the iron cube cannot pass through the plaster and
the rafters and neither do the materials of which the
ceiling is composed fly into space as heretofore all
supporters of the gravitational theory would have us
believe would e the case were gravitation to be sud-
denly cut off and now i will give you an even greater
surprise as he spoke he pressed a switch the iron cube
dropped back with a hang to the low table where it had
originally rested and sir esme produced a sheet of thin
cardboard with long cords attached to the four corners
fastening these to hooks in the walls he suspended the
pasteboard sheet above the picce of metal

  now he remarked if i produce an esmeismic area
to indude both the iron cube and the suspended card
what do you imagine will occur i smiled had you
not already assured me that objects attached to other
objects outside the sphere of influence are not affected
i should say without hesitation that the cardboard and
the iron would rise to the ceiling as it is i cannot be-
lieve that those slender bits of twine can restrain the card
acted upon by a force or rather a lack of force strong
enough to levitate a block of solid iron

  here is the answer he exclaimed

chapter v

the esmeismic force

  as sir esme spoke there was a sharp dick and i
       gazed speechless with wonder even though i had
       been somewhat prepared for what i saw

  again the iron cubc had flown upward as if hurled
from a hidden spring and had struck the suspended card-
board but instead of tearing through it or snapping
the strings that secured the card in place the piece of
metal merely lifted the card a lew inches and then re-
mained pressed against the fragile barrier as though the
cardboard had been a sheet of steel

  sir esme grinned and chuckled triumphantly now
what do you think  he cried exultantly

  ill he hanged if t know what to think i admitted
why the deuce didnt the iron go through the card-
or at least force it upward

  thats the identical question i asked myself he re-
plied and i can assure you that it amazed and puzzled
me fully as much as it does you now watch closely and
ill show you another miracle

  once again he allowed the iron to sink back to the
table i am about to demonstrate to you the truth of
my deductions in regard to the inverted cone or vortex
he informed me  as he spoke he was arranging a second

sheet of cardboard suspended a few feet above the first
then lie stepped to the low table and placed several iden-
tical iron blocks upon it and a few inches from one an-
other these he observed might represent so many
human beings and what you arc about to witness will i
think answer one of your queries and will amply prove
the truth of my assertions this one he indicated the
cube he already had used is as you will notice rest-
ing upon a mark that represents the exact apex of the
invisible vortex i am about to produce the others are
slightly outside the apex now again he touched the
switch and once more the iron soared upward and came
to rest against the lower surface of the suspended card
but not another of the cubes moved you see said
he that only the cube at the apex of the cone was af-
fected now if my deductions are correct if the affected
space is in reality an inverted cone there will of neces-
sity be a wider a larger area of interrupted esmeism on
the suspended sheets of cardboard than upon the table
do you grasp my meaning 

  i nodded certainly i assured him i can imagine
an inverted cone its apex resting upon the table and in-
tersected by the two sheets of pasteboard naturally
the uppermost sheet will bisect the imaginary cone where
its diameter is greater than where it is bisected by the
lower sheet

  precisely- he agreed again he permitted the levi-
tated iron to drop back then he picked up the others
and placed them at varying distances upon the first of
the suspended sheets marking with a pencil the position
of each now watch he cautioned me and once more
set his concealed apparatus in motion now i had i felt
begun to grasp the whole idea i had begun to take the
astonishing feats he performed as a matter of course and
what he had told me should have prepared me for the
results that followed

  yet i could not repress an exclamation of wonder as
the first cube flew up and at the same instant three of
the cubes upon tire cardboard rose as if possessed with
life until they rested against the upper sheet

  sir fsmes eyes twinkled under his bushy brows
funny stunt as you americans say isnt it he
chuckled but do you notice that the three cubes resting
against the second barrier are more widely separated than
when they were placed upon the first 

  i had not noticed but now that he drew my attention
to it i saw he was right pin sorry i cannot mark their
precise positions he said but the confounded thing
is still too uncertain and in too much the experimental
stage to permit me to insert my hand or any portion of
my anatomy within the sphere of the vortex im no
coward but-

  dont try it for heavens sake i exclaimed

  i have no intention of doing so-just at present he
assured me but as i was about to say if i could mark
the positions of the cubes it would simplify matters for
you however there are more ways than one of skin-
ning an eel-or was it a cat -as the old saying goes

  once more he caused the various suspended pieces of
metal to resume their former positions then he re-
moved them from the first sheet of cardboard and placed
them at much wider distances apart upon the upper sheet
marking the position of each as before

  by now i was prepared for almost anything and it did
not greatly surprise me to see the cubes fly upward and
strike the ceiling like a charge of exaggerated shot


amazing stories

  i think you will agree that they are far more widely
separated tip there than when they rested upon the card
said sir esme glancing up at the bits of iron dotting the
plaster above us and he continued you noticed that
whereas only three left the first sheet and the others a
few inches further from the center were not disturbed
all those that were resting on the second sheet were lifted
although several were twice the distance from the center
of the sheet as were the others now do you agree that
i have proved my contentions in respect to the inverted
cone or vortex

  i most assuredly do i declared but for that mat-
ter i never questioned that contention that was to me
perfectly reasonable and logical in fact speaking as a
layman and not as a scientist i should have assumed that
any force or rays projected from the surface of the earth
in all directions-or focussed upon the earths surface-
would of necessity impinge or emanate at angles-that
they would radiate like the spines of a sea-urchin or the
spokes of a wheel and hence if considered in small
groups would form what might be termed inverted
cones

  hear hear cried sir esme delightedly a con-
cise a brilliant speech but- seriously-all joking

aside you have grasped the idea perfectly

  however  went on i do not yet see how you can
account for such mysteries as harveys memory and the
marie celeste by these amazing properties of your force
and i would like to know-provided you can explain
it-why or how a sheet of cardboard stops lumps of iron
from moving upward why the sheets themselves are not
lifted and what is still more astonishing and inexplic-
able to me why if the cards stop the iron lumps and are
not themselves moved objects placed upon them rise
im very sorry to have to admit that i cannot fully
account for that myself but i think it a sort of ground-
ing if t may use the term in other words i believe that
any object connected ever so lightly with objects out-
side the sphere of the vortices is so to say grounded to
those outside and hence is not affected and to a cer-
tain extent such objects are insulators

  although as you saw the cubes placed upon the cards
were affected and rose upward yet my tests have proved
that the force or absence of force becomes less after
passing through such objects-filtered as it were in
fact had i placed a dozen or more sheets above my
apparatus the cubes if placed upon the highest sheet
would scarcely have been affected now of course with
the influence reversed coming from outer space towards
the earth this might not be the ease yet i am convinced
that it is and i am convinced that it is due to these still
mysterious and inexplicable laws of esmeism that in all
cases of vanishing persons ships et cetera all have taken
place in the open air i do not know of a single case of a
human being vanishing when within a building

  all very well and good sir esme i assented but
i am still harping on the same subject can you give me
a logical and lucid explanation of how or why the human
beings on the marie celeste vanished without any por-
tion of the ship being disturbed provided they were as
you claim carried off by one o-f your esmeismic cones
forming over the ship

  of course i can he declared its very simple
but id forgotten to mention that in the course of my
tests and experiments i discovered that the susceptibility
of various substances to the release of esmeismic force

varies greatly organic matter is affected much less than
inorganic matter for example and metals are affected
more than wood and other substances

  that fact has a great bearing upon the baffling mys-
teries you mention briefly then my theory is this the
marie celeste passed through or came within the area of
influence of one of these vortices-one of minor intensity
or power as i might say but which was sufficiently pow-
erful to cause all human beings on deck to be carried
into space-together with the dog and cat you remem-
ber they too were missing and-

  hold on i interrupted how about the men below
decks and how about objects on deck

  no doubt he continued oblivious of my interrup-
tion any persons who may have been below deck came
on deck owing to unwonted sounds or possibly cries i
feel sure these vortices move about and it is quite pos-
sible that in this particular case the persons were not all
lifted into air at once but some were seen to vanish by
their terrified comrades who paralyzed with superstitious
fear made no attempt to escape a fate of which they
were totally ignorant and as regards articles upon
deck how do we know such objects did not vanish it
was reported that boats deck fittings hatch covers etc
were undisturbed but all objects attached or even lashed
to the vessel would have remained as i have demon-
strated

tt seems utterly incredible t declared yet i admit
it is no more incredible than the known facts and not
as incredible as many of the theories advanced to explain
the mystery but granting it did occur as you say how
about ilarvey and the other cases

  harvey exclaimed sir esme i am convinced
harvey was upon that spanish vessel that vanished leav-
ing no trace i believe that the ship came within the area
of an esmeismic vortex that it was swept upward and

that portions of it-including ilarvey-were dropped

back to the sea a thousand miles from the spot where the
ship vanished

  i was absolutely dumbfounded at sir esmes words
that any sane man could propound such a wild impos-
sible theory even if his deduction in respect to the marie
celeste and other mysteries were corrcct seemed abso-
lutely preposterous yet sir esme seemed sane normal
and absolutely sincere in fact he appeared to sense
nothing very remarkable and certainly nothing incred-
ible in his amazing statements

  good lord man i gasped how could he-how
could any man-survive such an experience

  men have survived worse he commented laconically
and the very fact that he was nearly dead and had lost
all memory proves he had undergone some terrible ex-
perience something worse than mere immersion in a
tropical sea for a few hours everything points to the
truth of my deduction did i not tell you that the ob-
jects i projected to extreme heights ahvays fell back to
earth at some distance to the southwest of the spot
whence they departed 

  and i have made careful calculations and am positive
that a vessel lifted or propelled or levitated-whichever
you prefer-at the position in which the santa hies was
or should have been at the time of her disappearance
would have returned to the earth-in case she returned at
all-in or very near the precise spot where i found
harvey floating on his bit of wreckage
the non-gravitational vortex



  but i objected in that case why were there no
others-no other bits of wreckage to be found and
why should the ship or anyone on her return to earth 
admitting for the sake of argument that your theory is
correct-that the marie celeste the santa lues any ships
or other objects were lifted whisked into space by such
a phenomenon why should they or any portion of them
return to earth  why sir esme that would defeat your
own arguments tf such were the case why is it that
none of the persons who have vanished-the crew of
the marie celeste for instance have ever been found 

  plenty of reasons and logical ones he declared posi-
tively an object-even a ship drawn or forced or
whatever you may call it into tlie air by one of these
esmeismic vortices if in the center of tlie area would no
doubt be lifted so far that it never returned or it might
be completely disintegrated by its inconceivably rapid ro-
tation whereas if the objects were near the outer edges
of the vortex so to say or if the vortex were weak or as
very probably occurs the area of esmeism is merely tem-
porary and of brief duration lhen in cither case the
objects might be lifted for only a short distance and
might be dropped back to earth t can perhaps make my
meaning clearer by calling your attention to the phe-
nomena of a whirlpool although many objects may be
drawn into its center and sucked down forever into its
vortex other objects are constantly thrown out and even
after being caught in the rotating currents escape and
drift safely away such-

  but even if the objects that had been lifted did drop
back they would be shattered by the impact with the
earth or sea i exclaimed cutting off his words

  he smiled and shook his head on the contrary ob-
jects levitated by the esmeismic vacuum do not drop
back with any force he informed me you may not
have noticed it but if you had given the matter atten-
tion you would have observed that the iron blocks the
bits of lead that i caused to rise in the air fell back
gently with  appreciable impact upon the table below
them that is a most remarkable feature of the action
of the force

  it appears to me that the area of esmeism cannot be
suddenly replaced by the normal force but regains its
normal state rather slowly thus allowing suspended or
levitated objects to sink back almost as if they were be-
ing lowered by mechanical means

  i had not noticed this feature of the experiments he
had made for my benefit but now that he called it to my
mind i remembered it was so the lifted cubes of metal
had struck the ceiling with quite an appreciable and
forceful impact but they had dropped back to the table
with no noise and as i recalled it as lightly as though
they had been bits of cotton in that case why shouldnt
a human being be projected upward and dropped back as
gently as though attached to a parachute and uninjured
but to be carried a thousand miles before being dropped
that was too much but sir esme was again speaking

  whats so remarkable about it he demanded as if
reading my thoughts there are plenty of authentic in-
stances of men of animals even of young children being
whirled into the air by cyclones or tornadoes carried a
mile or more and dropped unharmed and if my con-
clusions are correct-and i am sure they are-cyclones
tornadoes waterspouts are all merely the manifestations
of these same esmeismic vacuums and if you or any-
one else can suggest a more credible or a more reasonable

hypothesis to account for the disappearance of the marie
celestes passengers and crcw i should like to hear it
it isnt as if her case were the only one tlie same thing
has occurred repeatedly and when a mysterious inex-
plicable tiling of that sort is repeated we may feel sure
it is the result of some natural if unknown law of na-
ture can-

  you mean to say there have been cases similar to that
of the marie celestef i interrupted i always thought
hers a unique mystery

  not a bit of it he declared why only recently-
less than two years ago-the crew of the kobenhavn
vanished in the same baffling manner didnt you ever
hear of it 

  i believe i read that such a vessel-she was a train-
ing ship for the danish navy was she not-was lost
with all hands

  exactly he said and in that fespect only did her
case vary from that of tlie more famous marie celeste
the latter ship was picked up and towed into port
whereas the kobenhavn disappeared-foundered or went
ashore-and was lost but-

  there doesnt appear to be anything mysterious in
that i observed i-

  not so fast  he warned me the ship as i say
was lost-but long before she was lost she was seen
sailing unharmed without a soul oil board

  you mean- i began but he checked me with a
gesture

  on january tlie twenty-first  the kobenhavn
passed the island of tristan da cunha under single jib
foresail and lower topsails she passed the island within
a quarter of a mile from the shore she was seen and
watched by the islanders several of whom possessed ex-
cellent glasses and to their utter amazement not a liv-
ing soul could be seen aboard and no man was at the
ships helm she came very near striking a reef but was
carried aside by a veering of the wind and the current
and vanished in the mist but all agreed that she was
uninjured her sails as far as seen were whole her
furled canvas was in perfect shape her boats and deck
liltings were in place although she was slightly down
by the stern from that day to the present no sign of
tlie great ship nor of her crew of fifty naval cadets has
ever been found she left montevideo  december
th on december st she radioed that all was well and
on january st she was an abandoned but seaworthy
vessel with sails and all intact had she been picked
up she would have proved an even greater mystery than
the marie celeste but beyond doubt she went down soon
after passing tristan an unmanned ship has little
chance of surviving long and there is another ease i
might mention-that of the steamship eltham that sailed
from swansea in november 

  ah there was a case that in some respects resembles
that of the santa ines and harvey a week before the
eltliam sailed from swansea laden with coals she was
found ashore at chapel porth in cornwall ashore
within  yards of the beach not an unusual thing
you will say but-there was not a soul on board her
boilers were cold there were no papers no log noth-
ing movable left in the cabins or on deck and there was
not a ton of coal in her hold yet aside from a hole
knocked in her bottom by the rocks where she came
ashore she was uninjured and her boats were intact
rut-here is the most amazing feature of all-the fea-


amazing

stories

lure that i feel proves my conclusions more than
twenty vessels were anchored in the harbor during the
night that preceded the discovery of the eltham yet not
one had seen the ship enter or go ashore i-

  you mean you actually believe she had been carried
up by one of those vortices and had been dropped on the
cornish coast i cried

  absolutely he replied otherwise how can you
account for a staunch six hundred ton welsh collier
bound from swansea to rouen dropping unseen into a
cove on the coast of cornwall and liow can you ex-
plain the absence of her crew of every movable object
aboard even of her cargo i am positive certain as i
atn of anything that the eltham was hurled into space
by coming in contact with an area of esmeism that she
was carried for miles to be dropped eventually on the
cornish coast and that during her amazing journey her
cargo dropped out or ralher was carried away by the
same phenomenon that lifted her from the sea

ilea ned back utterly unable to voice my astonish-
ment hardly able to think sanely and connectedly
the facts faced us and a sir esme had said no cred-
ible hypothesis other than his seemed to fit the cases he
had mentioned and yet his theory was as incredible as
the mysteries it purported to solve for a few mo-
ments he busied himself with the map then he turned
again to me

  those are merely examples he observed i might
also mention the unexplained disappearance of the cy-
clops-the naval freighter of your country that laden
with manganese from brazil vanished completely when
off earbadoes and if we search through the maritime
records we will find hundreds thousands of cases of ves-
sels reported as missing of which no trace ever has been
found and yet vessels that were staunch sound anil were
not in the vicinity of storms when they disappeared
they-

  collisions might account for them or-

  in which case the vessel in collision would have re-
ported the accident he reminded me and he con-
tinued although i am very familiar with ships and ship-
ping and maritime casualties i do not recall a single in-
stance where two vessels disappeared coiucidently in the
same vicinity as would have been the case had there been
a colllision that scut both to the bottom no my friend
my theory or rather my discovery is the only plausible
explanation and leaving ships aside for the time be-
ing how else can you explain such mysterious dis-
appearances as that of dorothy arnold our country-
woman who vanished in broad daylight in new york
cily leaving no trace there are scores of similar
cases i kuew personally of one gentleman who van-
ished as completely and even more mysteriously in the
west indies and who-now you may not believe this
but i can readily verify my statements-was seen and
spoken to by a policeman at a spot more than twenty
miles from where he disappeared within ten minutes
after he vanished and exactly as in harveys case he
seemed numbed in mind dazed completely out of his
head unfortunately he disappeared the second time-
though that was easily explicable for he was seen at die
verge of a treacherous lake and in his mentally chaotic
condition no doubt was accidentally drowned more-
over on at least two occasions i know from trustworthy
observers that people who vanished-actually one might

say before their comrades eyes-disappeared in whirl-
wind-like columns of sand and dust exactly what might
be expected as a result of one of the esmeismic vortices
good lord i exclaimed come to think of it one
of my relatives vanished in much the same way it was
in maine he had left the house one winters night to
get a bucket of water from the well no one ever saw
him again his footsteps led half way to the well and
ended there there was a fresh fall of snow on the
ground and-now i recall die details as narrated by my
father who was there at the time-there was a peculiar
round depression in the snow just where the footprints

ceased if-

  by jove a perfect case cried sir esme as trium-
phantly as though he had made a fresh discovery
and he added exultantly that helps me a great deal
it carrics my sphere of occurrences a bit farther north

than i had been able to trace it i-

  your what i queried unable to understand what
he meant

  just what i said he replied see here- indicat-
ing the chart on die desk-i have been marking down
the locations of every occurrence that i have been able hi
attribute to the esmeismic vortices i have two as far
north as new york one in northern ireland and now
this one of yours in maine but as you will see they are
far more numerous in the tropical and semi-tropical areas
than either north or south that fact i am sure is most
important

  i had been studying die chart as he spoke and noticed
as he said that the marks-each of which was numbered
-were far more numerous in the tropics than elsewhere
and that there were more marks on sea than on land

  evidently if you are right in your belief the phe-
nomena take place more frequently on the ocean than
elsewhere i remarked

  ilmm so i assume he said but in that i may be
mistaken very possibly it is because we hear of practi-
cally every ship that vanishes whereas we hear of only
a portion of the human beings who disappear more-
over i have not  marked all the tornadoes cyclones
waterspouts whirlwinds and similar occurrences that
are everyday happenings in many parts of the world
but i have indicated the areas in which they occur in
greatest numbers and with the greatest frequency and
i have plotted their tracks as you see

  have you come to any conclusions regarding their
occurrence i asked do they appear to follow any
definite laws or to recur repeatedly in or near the same
spot it seems to me that there should be some means
of checking up and determining if they bear any rela-
tion to other phenomena such as sun-spots air-curreats
volcanic disturbances the solstices or anything else

  in a way i have he informed me i am not at all
sure that they do not remain constant or nearly constant
at certain points and i am positive that there are cer-
tain areas where they are very common such an area
i believe lies about here sir esme placed his finger on
a shaded space hi the south atlantic and another here
he indicated a similar spot in the north atlantic

  why do you assume that i asked i do not no-
tice any of your numbers in this north atlantic area
sir esme turned to me and laid liis hand impressively
upon my arm that said he in low but earnest tones
is because no one knows no living soul has ever
returned from there to tell what took place it-
the nor-gravitational vortex



  surely i exclaimed ships must pass there it is
almost in the regular lanes oi transatlantic shipping

  ships yes he admitted but i am not referring to
ships i am speaking of airplanes have you never
wondered how or why so many airplanes attempting to
cross the atlantic have vanished have you never won-
dered why no traces of them have been found why oth-
ers-not better not piloted by more capablc men-have
made the crossing safely here is the area where all
those machines have vanished why because if i-am
not vastly mistaken it is an area where esmeismic vor-
tices abound-vortices whose presence does not affect
the surface of the sea-or at most only slightly-
enough to produce waterspouts that abound in the area
but poised as it were above the ocean-vast terrible in-
visible traps of certain death and destruction to all air-
planes and aviators who rush blindly unwittingly into
them

  pardon me i i seem to be a doubling thomas i
said but honestly is it necessary to account for missing
airplanes by such a theory tsnt it as reasonable to
suppose that storms fog failing motors structural faults
or even air holes or similar causes accounted for the
missing fliers

  airplanes come to grief over the land and if the same
accidents occurred at sea they would he among the
missing

  i could see that the subject was most painful to my
friend yet he controlled his feelings and spoke calmly

  do you know what percentage of aviation accidents
and fatalities have never been explained he asked
why does a plane in perfect condition piloted by a
skilled and competent man flying in perfectly clear good
weather over a route it has traversed scores of tunes
suddenly crash without any apparent reason why does
a trans-channel machine that has made the crossing
regularly and safely for months suddenly turn flutter
like a wounded bird and fall and what are these air
holes you mention  what are the so-called dead spots
in the air there is one answer to all these questions
areas of esmeism and though you may not be aware
of the fact airplanes have vanished as completely over
land as over sea the only reason there are more mys-
terious disappearances at sea than ashore is because the
oceans cover a greater area of the earths surface than
the land covers and because as far as i can judge by this
map and available data the phenomena occur more fre-
quently over water than over land

  can you suggest any reason for that i inquired
changing the subject of discussion

  possibly due to mountains to forests to many causes
that exist  land and not on sea he replied i am
convinced that the vortices move about-travel from
place to place-oftentimes with great speed and in that
case they may be interrupted broken as it were by
mountain ranges we know that tornadoes cyclones
watcr-spouts are thus broken and i am sure they are
merely manifestations of the same phenomena but-
he rose and almost glared at me- i intend to learn the
absolute truth of all these matters i intend to put my
theories as you call them to a crucial test and if you
wish you may have a part in my investigations within
the week i sail on the loch lovern to cruise about these
areas i have indicated to learn if it is possible to learn
if there are such -areas would you care to accompany
me

chapter vi

in search of vortices

for some reason-to this day i cannot explain ex-
actly why-sir esmes announcement struck me
as extremely ludicrous it brought-to my mind a
fleeting vision of don quixote tilting with the windmills
and i burst out laughing bui at the half-injured half-
angry expression upon his face i controlled myself and
lied glibly in explanation of my ill-timed hilarity

  forgive me i exclaimed i was -not laughing at
your surprising announcements but at the thought of
myself-something of an iconoclast regarding your theo-
ries-accompanying you of what earthly service would
i be

  sometimes he remarked thoughtfully an iconoclast
is far more useful than a true believer as a matter of
fact my friend your ignorance-pardon me for using-
such a crass word-oi science and your common sense
objections and queries have already been of inestimable
service to me you have enabled me to see things from
the laymans viewpoint to note the weak points in my de-
ductions and you have repeatedly called myattention to
details or to facts that i might well have overlooked in
my intense interest in following along prescribed lines
you have been in short a check or brake as it were
and you have been a most delightful skeptic as i might
say in our discussions i shall be immensely pleased to
have you with me on the cruise and while i may fail
utterly in my efforts to locate and study the esmeismic
vortices-i can promise you a pleasant trip possible ex-
citement and if all goes well a unique experience and-
danger

  if all goes well i cried if all goes well as you
call it we may share the fate of the crew of the marie
celeste and the kobenkavn i suppose you mean 

  sir esme grinned quite possibly he admitted
although i scarcely expect so i am not going to beard
the vortices in their dens so to speak without being duly
prepared of what value to me to the world would my
observations prove if i vanish no i am providing
for every contingency i can foresee-though when deal-
ing with unknown or almost unknown forces it is difficult
to foresee all contingencies that may arise-and i be-
lieve i have confidence that we will noi meet with dis-
aster but-

  but if we do i supplied it will all be in the name
of science eh well i for one have no desire to be a

martyr to that cause i-

  then you will not accept my invitation he queried
and i could see he was disappointed

  on the contrary i shall i assured him frankly
i havent yet been convinced oi the truth of your the-
ories or deductions mind t do not for a moment ques-
tion your discovery of the force i so glibly named esme-
ism neither do i deny that you have proved much
in fact almost all that you claim by means of experi-
ments i have witnessed but i do not admit that those
tests or your discovery prove that similar phenomena
occur in nature nor that the mysteries of disappearing
human beings-nor of missing airships-can be attrib-
uted to such phenomena hence i havent the least fear
of being drawn or thrown or sucked or whatever you
may call it into space but i shall enjoy a deep water
cruise i shall enjoy your yacht your excellent food


amazing stories

your unparalleled wines and liquors your cigars and-
most of all-your companionship and if you should
trail down one of your damnable old vortices i shall
be delighted to make its acquaintance although i have
no desire to emulate old elijah nor to duplicate harveys
experience

  topping  ejaculated sir esme i was perfectly
positive you would go along in fact i do not believe
a word that you say in respect to your disbelief in my
theory you are just as firmly convinced of the truth
as i am and speaking of elijah he too i am sure
was the victim of one of the vortices and if i am not
mistaken he is the only man who actually was seen to
vanish by such means

  hmm i observed i think you are wrong about
that wasnt there an aztec legend to the effect that
quetzalcoatl the plumed-serpent was borne heaven-
ward by a whirlwind

  by jove youre right he cried i must put that
down on my chart that adds another area where the
vortices have occurred

  if you keep on and credit every old legend and myth
and allegory youll find they occur everywhere i told
him in which case why go to sea chasing the con-
founded things -why not wait here in london until
one comes along and by the way has one ever per-
formed any of its stunts in or about london

  not as far as i can learn at least not within well-
two hundred years he replied nor has any happen-
ing that can be attributed to the vortices ever been re-
ported from the black country of the midlands or from
any colliery district i believe-in fact i am fairly cer-
tain-that smoke and fog are the greatest preventives
of the vortices in fact i depend for our safety-in
case i locate a vortex-upon smoke-screens of course
it is in a way negative evidence but i feel that is one
reason why the preponderance of occurrences that i at-
tribute to the phenomena have taken place in portions of
the world where fog and smoke are non-existent or

nearly so i-

  if you could only catch one of them and train it to
hover over london at just the right distance above the
city you would be conferring a real boon on your fellow
men i told him i should imagine that it might prove
the most efficient of fog and smoke eliminators

  on the contrary he informed me a london fog or
london smoke would eliminate the vortices

  gosh i ejaculated as a sudden idea flashed across
my mind isnt it possible youve got the cart before
the horse isnt it possible that the prevalence of fog
over london and other localities is due to the absence of
your vortices instead of vice versa nobody ever has
been able satisfactorily to explain why some places are
foggy and others not-at least not to my satisfaction
do you know there are a lot of possibilities in your
theory sir esme-if a man could only believe in it
if there were not i should not bother with it he
assured me dryly and the possibilities-i might even
say the probabilities-are far greater than you or even
i imagine i am not at all sure that static sun-spots
a score no better-hundreds-of natural phenomena
are not all caused by or at least do not have a direct
relation to esmeism and esmeismic vortices

  well heres hoping well make their better acquaint-
ance i said rising to go but like yourself i shall
prepare for emergencies if there is any truth in your

deductions it appears to me that your inverted cones of
non-existent gravitation are about as dangerous to
monkey with as the proverbial buzz-saw i think i shall
see my solicitor in the morning and have liim draw up
my last will and testament but-with a laugh-im
afraid it would be a difficult matter for him to prove
my demise if i vanish and wouldnt the old bird have
a jolt if  should come sailing down past his window and
drop into lincolns inn fields some fine morning

  the chances are that if you did you would not know
where you were or who you were he said youd
probably be in much the same mental state as poor har-
vey for i believe the action of the esmeismic vacuum
has a serious and inexplicable effect upon the human
mind

  thats comforting i retorted but it might be in-
teresting-and even convenient-to forget the past and
start life as a new individual

  sir esme shook his head in despair im afraid you
never will take the matter seriously he lamented but
before we are done you may find it serious enough good
njght my friend i hope to leave portsmouth next
wednesday but i shall see you again before then

saw sir esme several times during the week that
followed and having as he had surmised been
more than half convinced of the truth of his remarkable
theory i abandoned my flippant scoffing attitude and
became intensely interested in his work and especially
in his preparations for locating possible vortices and hi
safeguarding his vessel and ourselves from their action
very largely he depended upon two things for safety
one was the insulating material that he had invented
or i might say had discovered and which as he had
told me was an essential part of his appliance for creat-
ing artificial or synthetic areas free of the esmeism
the second was smoke to be produced instantaneously
and in immense volume by devices he was having man-
ufactured according to his own design

  as he took pains-and patience-to explain to me he
was not absolutely certain that either device would prove
a safeguard he was dealing with a new force with
unknown conditions and very largely everything was
theory and guesswork but he had made exhaustive tests
with smoke and had proved beyond question that his
appliance was incapable of creating the so-called gravita-
tional vacuum or of lifting objects when the area above
was filled with even a small amount of smoke as he
explained it the smoke-composed of course of impal-
pable motes of carbon-acted as a sort of coherer or
binder to retain the esmeism although he frankly ad-
mitted this explanation was mere theory the insulator
on the other hand served as a sort of condenser or
shield

  it was a most difficult matter for a layman to under-
stand for he was dealing with the absence of a force
instead of its presence and while i could conceive of a
ray a wave almost anything being reflected from an
object or absorbed by it my mind could not adapt itself
to the absence of a force a vacuum as it were being re-
flected absorbed or acted upon in any way the trouble
was that my mind-although t knew better-would in-
sist upon retaining the impression that the areas where
esmeism was non-existent were areas of actual vacu-
um-nothingness-whereas as a matter of fact they
were identical with the rest of the atmosphere except
the non-grayitational yortex



that within them there was no gravitational pull i must
thus express it although it was no pull but rather a push
according to sir esme and they might be compared to
shadowy areas where there were no light waves or areas
of atmosphere where electro-magnetic waves were ab-
sent but revolutionary matters that upset all precon-
ceived ideas are always difficult for the ordinary non-
scientific mind to grasp especially when our senses-
sight or hearing-cannot be brought into play but as
sir esme very pointedly and succinctly put it it didnt
make any difference whether or not i understood the
matter as long as he did

  also he had collected-from what sources or how the
lord alone knows-dozens hundreds of authentic rec-
ords of inexplicable disappearances happenings and acci-
dents which he attributed to his discovery lie had se-
cured data of every cyclone tornado and water-spout
that had been recorded by die mctcorological bureaus of
the united states and foreign governments innumerable
excerpts from ships logs and he had delved into tradi-
tion and history searching out accounts of similar phe-
nomena

  all these he had correlated tabulated and arranged
and had indicated them upon his chart until it was cov-
ered with dots and numbers he was as delighted as
a child with a new toy to find that his theories were being
borne out by all this that they were so he assured me
portions of the sea and of the land where his areas of
esmeism were so numerous and of such frequent occur-
rence as to be almost constant whereas in other sections
they were practically non-existent and he had worked
out and plotted by curves that made his map resemble
a weather chart dicir movements for he was now posi-
tive that he was correct in his assumption that the areas
did move not only that he had being intensely inter-
ested in astronomy worked out a theory that the areas
had a direct relation to planetary conditions and he abso-
lutely astounded me when a day or two before we were
to sail he declared apparently in all seriousness that in
his opinion the phenomena were not natural but were
produced by the inhabitants of another planet

  why not he demanded when i derided this idea
what do we know of the other planets or their inhab-
itants it is absolute piffle to assume that any of them
are not habitable why damn it tlie moon might be
inhabited for all we know or venus or mercury or
saturn-even die sun

   come come i cried thats going too far sir esme
how could a mass of flaming gas or a dead planet with
 atmosphere or a frozen sphere be inhabited  such
ideas are merely phantasmal

  he snorted why he again demanded ill tell
you why you and others assume such a stand merely
because you are judging or rather imagining all intelli-
gence all life by the life on earth and by the intelligence
of man

  what is intelligence nobody can answer but as it
is not an organic nor a concrete tiling how can it bo
affected by heat cold atmosphere in the case of man
it is i grant why because mans intelligence ends
with his life can manifest itself only by means of a
chemical organic thing we call a body but does that
prove that equal or far greater intelligence might not
exist without anything we would recognize as a body
because we humans-in our terrestrial life-require cer-
tain conditions certain chemicals and elements-certain

temperatures in order to exist we jump to the conclusion
that the same rules and laws hold throughout the uni-
verse

  for all we know an intelligent inhabitant of the moon
might feel the same way about us he might argue that
because he and his fellows needed no atmosphere as wc
know it needed what to us would be inconceivable cold
intelligent life was impossible on our planet because of
its envelope of atmosphere which would smother such
life with its comparatively terrific heat why confound
it all man an inhabitant of mercury or even of the sun
might argue that our old earth is dead and cold com-
pared to his abode as the moon appears dead and cold to
us or vice versa beings-intelligences-upon one of
the cold planets might regard the earth as an uninhabit-
able glowing mass in comparison with the conditions he
would require for existence you smile very well
let me tell you some actual facts

  an ordinary fly-any ordinary insect even microbes
or germs as well as plant life-die instantly if immersed
in boiling water can we leap to the conclusion that no
life plant or animal can exist in boiling water not a
bit of it in the west indies in various parts of our
world there are insect larva as well as plants that not
only exist in but actually require boiling water i myself
have seen bubbling boiling steaming sulphur-impreg-
nated pools and geysers fairly swarming with insect
larva and filled with water plants to them water of
normal temperature would be as cold as ice water or
solid ice to everyday forms of aquatic life take the
other extreme we have insects-a dozen species at least
-as well as plants that exist thrive in snow and that
shrivel and die if exposed to temperatures above freez-
ing and if one form of life can dwell in boiling water
and another requires freezing temperatures right here on
earth what right have we to assume that nature-the
creator-did not people the planets with forms of in-
telligent life adapted to the conditions there i-

ut you forget that here on earth we have atmos-
phere-oxygen nitrogen water-regardless of
the temperature whereas-

  whereas he burst in on the moon there is no air
no water piffle because wc-because earthly forms
of life-need certain combinations of certain elements
yon argue that there can be no life no intelligence with-
out them just as well argue that because man horses-
any land animals-must have air tiiere cannot be life
in the sea or because fish die when taken from the
water no life can exist on land no no my friend
the trouble is man is such a damnably self-centered ego-
tistical self-sufficient creature that lie cannot-save in
rare instances-conceive of anything no not of any con-
dition that is totally foreign in complete opposition to
his own surroundings and cxistencey why man alive
he-you-no man can visualize or imagine an intelligent
being totally absolutely unlike anything we ever have
seen take stories of interplanetary travel for example
did you ever read such a story did you ever see a pic-
ture illustrating such a story-wherein the author-even
wells or verne-described or pictured the inhabitants
of another planet as wholly unlike anything on earth
of course not always there is something familiar about
them they are semi-human or semi-mechanical or
semi-bestial or a combination of all but never an entire-
ly new and distinct creation it is impossible that they


amazing stories

should be so i maintain that all the planets-even the
stars-are inhabited and i still adhere to my belief that
these areas of esmeism are produced by the intelligences
on some uliter planet

  for what purpose i asked unable and unwilling
to prolong the argument do you mean you believe
they are produced in order to injure us here

  how should i know he ejaculated very pos-
sibly but on the other hand they may merely -be the
result of accident-the result of activities on the other
planet very possibly the force-esmeism-is of vital
importance to the inhabitants up there very possibly
they have been using it for inconceivable periods-draw-
ing it extracting it from the space or from the other
planets just as we humans extract nitrates from the
air

  something like boring for oil i suggested

  sir esme nodded a rather far-fetched simile and
yet excellent he said

  i laughed at a rather quaint conceit that occurred to
me your theoretical martians or venetians or mer-
curians or whoever they are must have been everlast-
ingly surprised if one of their gushers brought up human
beings or ships or planes i hazarded

  do you know he said speaking quite seriously
ive had that same idea in my mind-though not exactly
as it occurred to you i have been wondering if it is not
possible that that is exactly what has occurred but
not by chance if the beings who are responsible for
these phenomena did not produce them with the purpose
of securing specimens froin our planet-er well-some-
thing after the manner in which we dredge strange speci-
mens from the depths of the sea

  surely i cried you are joking even if it were
possible for an object from the earth to be hurled no
lifted to the nearest planet it would require years ages
for it to travel such a distance

  you forget he reminded me that time is non-
existent in space today here may be a thousand-ten
thousand-years  the past or the future on another
planet for that matter if you were to be hurled
through space on an interplanetary trip you could not
possibly tell whether your journey lasted ten minutes or
ten centuries if it were not that your body your organs
accustomed to food and sleep at definite intervals would
warn you of the passage of what we call time

  i threw up my hands in despair its all quite beyond
me i declared i can never grasp these relativity and
fourth dimensional ideas lets get back to earth what
in every-day language do you hope to accomplish by
your cruise what is your purpose even if you find
the darned things what are you going to do about them

  my purposes are manifold he replied first-

tapping them off with his fingers i hope to prove be-
yond discussion that the areas of esmeism or non-
existent gravitation actually exist second  i hope to
learn something of the laws that govern them whether
they are as  assume confined to certain localities
whether they are-permanent or transient whether they
move about on defined -courses or whether they merely
occur ill sequences along such routes third i wish if
possible to determine-at least to my own satisfaction-
whether they are natural or are artificially produced
fourth if they are responsible for all the mysterious
occurrences attributed to them and finally-if i suc-
ceed in my other aims-i hope to be able to evolve some

means by which they may be avoided nullified or offset
i may be wholly unsuccessful of course i may not be
fortunate enough to locate one of the areas

  or unfortunate enough i suggested but arent
you undertaking a trifle too much to endeavor to check-
mate such phenomena

  possibly he admitted but by study and observa-
tion man has learned to minimize the dangers of earth-
quakes and hurricanes even though he has not been able
to prevent them if i could learn the laws the actual
facts regarding these areas why mightnt it be possible
to prophesy where and when they are likely to occur
and thus enable others to avoid them

  that said i sounds like the most sensible and
comprehensible idea you have propounded admitting
the existence of the areas-and i must confess  am
beginning to believe in them even if i cant quite swallow
the idea of their being produced with malice afore-
thought by beings on another sphere-the common sense
thing would be to learn all that is possible regarding
them do you know im beginning to-well almost to
hope we do run across one of the devilish tilings

chapter vii

caught in a vortex

when i boarded the loch lover-n for that mem-
orable voyage that was destined to end in such an
amazing and incredible manner i found that the
yacht had been completely transformed she had been
a most luxuriously appointed craft a floating palace al-
most provided with every device and accessory for
amusement comfort and whiling away idle hours and
days but now i found her-although outwardly no
different than before-stripped of all superfluous fittings
a floating laboratory in fact and equipped with scientific
instruments utterly bewildering to me and that must have
cost sir esme a fortune sir esme was not one to do
anything by halves once he had merged his personality
and his life with that of the fictitious alexander mac-
donald nothing it appeared mattered aside from this
one obsession to learn all it was humanly possible to
leam in regard to liis suppositious areas of esmeism
i say suppositious for while i had become a convert
to the theory in a way and regarded the existence of
esmeism as proven beyond question still i did not feel
that there was as yet any proof of the actual existence
of the areas sir esme was about to hunt for

  and i am free to confess that had i been convinced
of their existence-or had i dreamed there was the re-
motest chance of our locating them-i most assuredly
would not have accompanied sir esme on his remarkable
and-as i considered it at the time-quixotic cruise
not that t consider myself less courageous than the aver-
age man and certainly not because  overvalue my life
or go out of my way to avoid risks on the comrary i
have always been something of a fatalist and in my
years spent in wild and savage places risks had been as
much a part of the days work as meals or sleep but it
requires something more than mere physical courage to
face some unknown mysterious almost uncanny and
supernatural danger and few men i believe-and i know
personally i would not-would knowingly rub elbows
with a tornado or a water-spout merely in order to study
its habits or idiosyncrasies and if sir fsmes non-
the non-gr a vitational vortex



gravitational areas existed they were a thousand times
more dangerous more uncertain and yes more uncanny
than any tornado or water-spout that ever existed

  sir esme however although absolutely convinced ol
their actuality possessed the true scientists sublime
courage when it came to delving into the mysteries of
the unknown and his one consuming desire was to
locate one or more of the areas

  oddly enough too he had no assistants-if i except
ilarvey-although knowing him and knowing the ego-
tism of all great scientists it was not so strange after all
frankly-and i have had  inconsiderable experience
with them-i have yet to meet the true scientist who is
not inordinately jealous suspicious and fearful of some
one appropriating his ideas or discoveries they guard
their work and their experiments as if they were the most
priceless and coveted riches and yet in the end give
them to the public without recompense and in sir
esmes case there was another reason like many men
he was extremely sensitive to ridicule he would take
my humorous observations my flippant treatment of his
theories and reasonings in good part because he regarded
me as more or less of a fool because i made no claim
to being a scientist and yet at times i quite inno-
cently and unconsciously wounded his feeling by my atti-
tude and i am quite certain that had he been ridiculed
or scoffed at by a real scientist it would have been more
than he could have endured moreover he had harvey
and harvey was more than an assistant more a co-
worker i might say quite efficient scientific to his finger-
tips ever suggesting and aiding

   for the first few days after we left port the two were
busy arranging and adjusting their instruments and
equipments testing them unpacking cases and getting
everything in readiness for use while i-being passion-
ately fond of the sea--enjoyed the ship and trip as i had
promised sir esme i would enjoyed his cigars and his
liquors and enjoyed the excellent means for sir esmes
mania for science did not extend so far as to interfere
with his fondness for good living though the yacht
had been stripped of non-essential luxuries in fittings
no changes had been made in the stewards department

   to be sure i offered to aid him and ilarvey with the
scientific stuff but my offer was politely declined so
having nothing better to do i passed the time as the
loch lovern sailed steadily towards the canaries in
keeping a journal of the voyage and in writing-while it
was still fresh in my mind-a brief account of the inci-
dents and events that had transpired-a work which has
formed the foundation for the present narrative

  until we sighted teneriffe the cruise was without
any particular interest-nothing unusual occurred and
somewhat to my surprise sir esme did not as far as i
know make any attempts to locate the areas for which
he was in search but on the seventh day out he had the
yacht stopped and throughout the day he buried himself
amid his instruments i saw little of him except at meal
times when he informed me that we were on or near
the verge of one of die localities where the phenomena
might be expected but to his obvious disappointment
and somewhat to my relief nothing came of it and we
again began to cruise

   it was  the tenth day that seated on the after-deck
smoking and lazily watching the soaring man-o-war
birds the sky suddenly was blotted out by a dense cloud
of smoke that poured from a row of pipes that pro-

jected from the deck-houses almost instantly the vessel
was enveloped in almost total darkness and at the same
instant i felt a distinct shock a shudder of the vessel
as if she had struck some bit of floating wreckage or
perhaps better as if she had been proceeding under
power and her engines had suddenly been reversed

  instantly realization came to me the smoke could
mean but one thing that sir esme had detected the pres-
ence of one of his esmeismic areas and was attempting
to safeguard the yacht and those upon her by means of
his smoke-screen and as i realized this a strange
gripping fear came over me i felt cold shivers chasing
up and down my spine and i sat tense every nerve
strained and on edge waiting i knew not what

   it is difficult to describe my sensations difficult
to put into cold print the feelings that raced through my
brain as i sat there in that semi-darkness upon the yachts
deck with the heavy smoke-pall blotting out sea sky even
the masts above me in a silence that seemed uncanny
and knowing that close at hand perhaps hovering over
my head was the strange mysterious incredible vortex
that might at any instant sweep the ship with all 
board into space i felt like one who having scoffed at
ghosts is suddenly confronted by one it was more
than fear more than ordinary terror of something tan-
gible i had not believed in the things i had not ad-
mitted-even to myself-that they actually existed and
i had not for a moment expected sir esme to succeed in
his quest and now though it outraged common sense
though my mind could not fully grasp the actuality the
impossible had occurred and we were in the presence of
the mysterious invisible phenomenon i felt i knew tliat
everything depended upon the smoke-screen and yet i
could not feel sure that it could be relied upon it was
all guesswork all experiment and i mentally cursed my-
self for being such a fool to have taken part in such a
hare-brained mad undertaking

all this flashed through my consciousness in an in-
stant the next moment i had leaped up and was
dashing headlong through the twilight obscurity towards
sir esmes laboratory but i checked myself in time
even in my excitement i realized that to burst in upon
him to interrupt him at his work might result in disaster
yet i was mad filled with an overpowering desire to
learn the truth to know what was taking place how
long i stood there white-faced trembling striving to
force myself to be calm i cannot say it seemed hours
yet it could not have been more than minutes i was
brought to my senses by a burst of sunlight by seeing
the pall of smoke vanish and the next moment sir esme
appeared never had i seen him so excited so keyed
up yet his face was radiant his eyes fairly sparkled
triumph was in his voice as he spoke

  congratulate me he cried i was right the
areas exist and the smoke counteracts them destroys
them did-

  thank god i exclaimcd fervently but-

  everything worked out exactly as i had surmised as
i had deduced he continued heedless of my interrup-
tion did you feel the shock-the lift of the ship
it was marvelous according to my instruments the en-
tire vessel was lifted-drawn up nearly two inches before
the smoke-screen became efficient think of it my
friend and yet is was a comparatively small area and
we were not at the exact apex and-with a note of


amazing stories

real regret in his tones-it was completely dissipated
by the smoke what a pity how can i study the phe-
nomena if i am forced to avoid disaster by using smoke
and when by using smoke i destroy the phenomena 

  damned if i know t ejaculated but thank
heaven tlie confounded thing zvas destroyed it was
bad enough as it was and if that was a weak area may
tlie lord keep us away from a strong one and yet-
yet now it is over i cant really believe it i-

  relieve it or not its a fact he assured me and
best of all it proves i was right about the localities where
the areas exist do you know we are in almost the
precise spot where t tentatively placed the marie celeste
at the time her company vanished 

  i gasped the calm manner in which he made the an-
nouncement was simply amazing and unconsciously t
cast anxious half-terrified glances at tlie sparkling sea
as if expecting to see some visible manifestations of the
phenomenon

  for heavens sake lets get away from here i cried
youve proved your case youve learned how to coun-
teract the effects of the uncanny tilings what more do
you want 

  he laughed ive only begun he declared i must
learn if this was mere chance if there are others if they
are constant and i must investigate conditions in other
localities-in the vicinity of rhe spot where the koben-
havn was last reported in that area where so many air-
planes have vanished i-

  look here i interrupted youre taking a great
risk sir esme suppose you ran-across one of the
things at night or when you were not prepared to throw
off the smoke-screen why before you could say boo
we would all be done for forever tts deucedly hard for
me to believe the things exist and yet im convinced
theres something out here some uncanny mysterious
business going on and i admit i dont like the idea of
monkeying with it and how about your crew-what
do they think of this matter sailors are usually a
superstitious lot arent they scared

  why should they be he countered captain is-
bister lias perfect confidence in me and i warned him
before starting that we might experience some rather
disturbing occurrences but of course i have not at-
tempted to explain what they really are he and the
crew imagine it all a matter of scientific experiments-
meteorological in fact-and to their minds the slight
jar they felt was produced by me besides-he
chuckled at the idea-they have confidence in me no
doubt they argue that i must value my life and safety
and so there can be no danger and anyway theyre
all scots and- can say it without undue egotism-old
retainers who regard their laird as little less than divine
theyd follow me into hell without a question

  there is  use in repeating all the conversation all
the arguments i employed in my endeavor to induce sir
esme to abandon his to my mind mad and suicidal
intentions he was obsessed with the idea his first
experience-which i hoped and prayed was mere chance

and would never be repeated-had merely whetted his

desire for more and when he finally lost his patience and
sarcastically offered to set me ashore if i feared to go
on i retorted that if he imagined i possessed less courage
than he harvey or his scotch seamen he was vastly
mistaken and if he was bound to commit suicide and
lose his ship or be whisked off into space by tempting

fate and fooling with things he didnt know anything
about hed find me making an ass of myself along with
him then suddenly realizing that wed both lost our
tempers and had acted childishly we grinned had a
drink told each other we were damned fools and once
moie as friendly and agreeable as ever continued on the
cruise

  whether sir esmes calculations and deductions were
at fault whether the areas were -existent whether by
chance we missed them i cannot say but days passed
and despite his constant application his constant ob-
servations and tests sir esme was unable to locate a
second esmeismic disturbance we cruised back and
forth sailed in wide circles drifted idly over a glassy sea
passed and repassed the localities where according to sir
esmes deductions the phenomena should be most nu-
merous but there was  trace of them it began to
look as if our first experience was to be the only one
and i am sure that sir esme himself was becoming dis-
couraged and i could not blame him he had made a
great a monumental discovery he had evolved an elab-
orate an amazing hypothesis lie had devoted years of
research and a fortune to his efforts and now after all
his preparations his hopes and his optimistic expecta-
tions he had found only one of the strange esmeismic
areas and had been unable to study it or to learn any-
thing of value in regard to it no i should not say that
for as i told him i felt that he had learned the most
valuable and important fact of all namely that the dread
things could be nullified rendered perfectly harmless
he smiled when i called his attention to this fact

   quite true to a certain extent he agreed but abso-
lutely valueless you forget that in order to make use of
the smoke-screen one must know when and where the
phenomenon is about to occur i being constantly 
watch and equipped with the most delicate of devices
for detecting its presence was thus enabled to use the
smoke to advantage but you will recall that even so
i came very near complete failure what chance then
would a ship or an airplane have by tlie time tlie area
was detected it would be too late to nullify it no ship
has ever had time to send an sos before being over-
whelmed much less an opportunity of producing a screen
of smoke

  i had to admit he was right as matters stood his
discovery did not amount to anything as a safeguard

   sir esme possessed the proverbial british stick-to-it-
iveness and it began to look as if the cruise might con-
tinue forever and the lock lovcrn might become a sec-
ond flying dutchman we were in the doldrums at
that time and for day after day the ocean stretched as
smooth as a sheet of burnished silver under a cloudless
sky it was beastly hot time began to hang rather heav-
ily on my hands and i had become firmly convinced-
in my own mind-that the supposed area of esmeism
we had met had been nothing but an atmospheric dis-
turbance and that the things did not actually exist

   i had in fact returned to my original point of view
i thought what a superstitious fool i had been to have
been terrified by an imaginary danger that unquestion-
ably existed only in my friends mind and i was dead
sick and tired of the whole fruitless search i tried fish-
ing i dipped up buckets of the floating sargassum and
amused myself examining the strange crabs fish and
other marine creatures that inhabited it and i searched
the horizon until my eyes ached hoping vainly for the
the non-gravitational vortex



glimpse of a distant sail or smudge of smoke to tell me
we were not the only ship afloat upon that vast limitless
expanse of sea

it was while thus sweeping the horizon with my glasses
one morning that i descried a low dark object break-
ing the seas rim for a moment i thought it a whale
then i dccided it was a floating log yet it did nor ap-
pear exactly like a water-logged tree and my curiosity
aroused i hurried aloft for a better view then as 
focussed my glasses upon the tiling i discovered it was a
derelict the almost submerged hull of some wrecked ship
almost at the same instant the captain discovered it and
verified my observations there is always something
tragic something exciting about sighting a derelict and
soon all aboard the loch lovern who were not otherwise
engaged had gathered on deck their eyes flxed upon
the distant wreck slowly wc moved towards it each
minute it became nearer clearer and a couple of hours
after i had first caught sight of the tiling it was in plain
view the hull of a wooden vessel with the jagged
stumps of masts projecting above the decks that were
almost awash with shattered splintered bulwarks and so
weather-beaten so overgrown with seaweed that showed
each time the bulk rose or fell  the long almost in-
visible swell that it obviously had been floating about
for a long time

  something some whim tempted me to visit fee wreck
and sir esme ordered a boat lowered and manned al-
though he declined to join me declaring that if he de-
serted his instruments it would be just like his luck to
miss detecting the presence of one of his confounded
areas well if one comes along shunt it off from the
derelict i laughed as i jumped into the waiting boat
you see we havent any smoke-screen devices on her
as we pulled away i saw sir esme turn and enter the
laboratory where harvey had remained on duty and i
regretted having spoken so flippantly for he looked a
bit hurt and i knew how mortified he felt at the failure
of his plans but a moment later the boat was along-
side the hulk and with some difficulty for everything
was covered with slime and i dared not trust to the dan-
gling remnants of rolled cordage i managed to scramble
to the deck there really was nothing much to see the
decks where not washed by the water were white with
the droppings of sea birds the deck houses were
crushed in as if by falling spars and a glance within
the remains of the cabin revealed only black ill-smelling
water but the hatches were still in place and i sur-
mised that it must be the air within the hold that kept
the wreck afloat now that i was upon the derelict all
the lure of the unknown all the fascination of the ocean
waif was lost and i was on the point of calling to the
men to bring the boat alongside when one of them called
out that a portion of the wrecks name was still legible
upon the stern

  can you make it out i asked peering over the re-
mains of the after-rail we ought to report her if we
can find out what she is

  pretty well weathered sir he answered and only
shows when she rolls a bit to stahod looks to me like
a foreign name sir yes sir thats what tis dago o
some sort sir rum sort o name id say begins with

a s an ends with a s if-

  at that instant f felt a sudden rush of air there
was a peculiar gurgling moaning sound from behind me

startled fearing that the wreck was about to sink be-
neath me i whirled tense ready to leap into the sea
and swim for my life as i did so there was a sharp
terrified shout from the men gawd the loch lovern

  but i had already seen never will i forget what my
horrified eyes saw i seemed frozen glued to the spot
paralyzed from beneath the yachts keel a great column
of water rose up a foaming whirling roaring geyser
and upon its summit--rocking pitching spinning like a
teetotum was the loch lovern

   it was so terrible so unreal sq uncanny i could not
believe my senses i seemed in a nightmare a ghastly
dream and it seemed all the more dreamlike all the
more incredible and unreal because on every side the
sea stretched calm unruffled by the faintest breeze and
overhead the brilliant sun blazed down from a flawless
sky of blue

   up and up faster and yet faster rose the yacht while
below her the water boiled and roared like an inverted
whirlpool and then between her keel and the rnael-
storm below my incredulous eyes saw vacant space the
loch lovern was floating in air she was poised gyrat-
ing madly fully fifty feet above the sea and with a
numbing shock realization came to me she was caught
in one of the esmeismic vortices she was being lifted
projected into space

   it had all happened in an instant-perhaps in the frac-
tion of a second-yet to me it seemed minutes hours as
i gazed almost bereft of my senses at the yacht being
lifted bodily into the air by that unseen terrible force

  then suddenly yacht sky that fearful ominous cone
of swirling sea seemed blotted out where a moment
before they had been was a dense black cloud then to
our cars came the sounding of a rending crash waves
came rushing towards us from the writhing rolling cloud
of black the derelict rocked sluggishly the boat
pilchcd and tossed water hissed across the decks about
my feet i gasped caught my breath seemed choking
as i watched still incapable of movement striving to
penetrate that pall of blackness where the loch lovern
had vanished yet my mind was working my brain was
functioning i knew what had happened sir esme had
released his smoke-screen the gravitation had been re-
stored the yacht had fallen back into the sea but too
late the yacht crashing back from such a height must
has been shattered battered and sir esme harvey and
the others must have been killed

  slowly the smoke thinned drifting away with a
hoarse shout i came to life leaped into the boat shouted
swore at the men to bend to their oars frantically they
pulled for the wrecked and shattered yacht that was sink-
ing rapidly beneath the sea

chapter viii
the re-establishment of personalities

  as we reached the scene of the terrible disaster and
the boat humped against fragments of wreckage
- --the splintered topmasts of the loch lovern van-
ished and only the litter of floating wood a shattered
boat the deck fittings of the yacht and odds and ends of
flotsam remained as evidences of the tragic fate of sir
esmes ship

standing in the stern of the boat i searched among
the wreckage for possible survivors hoping against hope


amazing stories

that some one-sir esme harvey members of the
yachts crew-might have escaped instant death within
a dozen yards of the boat a body floated and the next
moment we were lifting the unconscious form of ilarvey
into our boat i thanked heaven that he still lived and
save for an ugly gash across one cheek and a bruise on
his forehead he seemed unhurt

  a moment jater we were beside another body the
uniform identified it as captain isbister but the face
and head were crushed beyond recognition two other
dead and mutilated bodies floated among tlie wreckage
and then half-hidden in die tangled debris we found sir
esme and as we lifted him gently i fervently thanked
god for he was alive and though unconscious appeared
to have escaped unharmed but we were in a desperate
plight we were afloat in a small boat in mid-atlantic
burdened with two unconscious men hundreds of miles
from the nearest land far out of the track of ships
and our only food and water were the meagre supplies
with which the small boats were always provided yet
i was so busy striving to restore sir esme and harvey
to consciousness that i scarcely realized the situation
until the quartermaster in charge of the boats crew
spoke

  beggin your pardon sir he said were in a rum
fix what with the bile o biscut an the keg o water
aboard sir maybe sir if  may be so bold as to sug-
gest it sir wed best have a look about an see can we
pick something from the wreckage sir and theres
that other stove boat sir maybe the biscuit an water
in hers all right sir

   yes by all means i agreed but be quick about it
we must get sir esme and harvey to the derelict its
our only refuge for the present

  luck was with us not only did we find the biscuit
and water in tlie wrecked boat still intact but among the
debris we picked up a cask half full of water a case of
wine a keg of ships beef and an unopened box of cheese
there was no danger of dying of thirst or starvation
for some time and even as we rowed towards the dere-
lict i was forming vague plans for salvation

  even the waterlogged derelict seemed welcome and
safe in comparison to the cockle-shell of a boat and
having transferred sir esme and ilarvey to the cleanest
and driest portion of tlie deck we devoted all our efforts
to reviving them both men evidently had been stunned
and rendered unconscious before falling into the sea a
most fortunate thing for they had drawn but little water
into iheir lungs rubbing them slapping them rolling
them on the decks forcing the welcome and providential
wine down their throats we worked at them harvey
was the first to regain consciousness he opened his
eyes took a deep breath blinked and gazed about
what--whats happened he whispered where am
i wheres captain mendoza and who are you i
dont recognize you how did you get here

  then before i could reply before i could recover
from my astonishment at his failure to recognize me and
my dread that he had received a blow that had deranged
him lie continued of course now i remember the
santa incs was wrecked struck by some sort of a
cyclone but i thought-i must have imagined it-i
was blown sucked from her rut of course you picked
me up where are the others who is the poor chap
yonder he indicated sir esme

  i was so amazed that for a moment i could not speak

he remembered lie had been on the santa foes his
memory had returned but how was it possible he did
not know sir esme that he did not know me or the
quartermaster then before i could frame a question
sir esme drew a deep breath sighed and opening his
eyes sat up with a jerk

  thank heaven youve recovered i exclaimed
i-

  what the deuce has happened he ejaculated what

the devil am i doing here  wheres-

  dont you remember i asked anxiously a numb-
ing chill at my heart for fear he had received some
serious injury to his brain the yacht was wrecked-
hurled into the air by one of the vortices but thank
god you used the smoke in time to save your life aud
that of harvey and youre on the derelict t picked

you both up it-

  yacht wreck vortices he cried what die
devil arc you talking about what do you mean by
smoke what derelict are you referring to

  my worst fears i felt were borne out sir esme
was raving he must be out of his head but perhaps
i thought it was merely the effects of shock a temporary
loss of memory

   it will all come back to you in a short time i as-
sured him no wonder you cannot get your wits to-
gether or your memory working right away its the
same with harvey he didnt recognize me at first but
thank god we are all safe for the present though poor
isbister and the rest are lost

  sir esme was frowning his bushy brows knit obvi-
ously striving to recall the details of the catastrophe

   i remember being on the yacht he said at last speak-
ing slowly and as if voicing each detail as it returned to
him and i recall that you were with me and harvey
of course but what the devil we were doing what hap-
pened is all a blank sorry to hear old isbisters gone
i suppose we must have run into this hulk eh funny
thing that he was a good seaman must have been
in the night i presume but i cant grasp what you
meant by the loch lovcrn being hurled into the air by
some devilish thing you call a vortex unless you mean
we were hit by a water-spout but whats to be done
next cant stop here on a half-sunken wreck for-
ever

  i shook my head sir esme spoke rationally sanely
but evidently he could not recall the tragedy and if-
my thoughts were interrupted by harvey who having
apparently regained nearly his normal strength had been
sitting up staring with a puzzled expression at sir esme
and myself

  pardon me but are you sir esme mcdonald he
asked

  sir esme wheeled what  he exclaimed by gad
are we all crazy of course i am i might just as well
ask you if youre harvey

  well im not was the amazing reply whos
harvey i never heard of him im professor arch-
ibald ilumiston of langford i recognized you from
pictures ive seeii and i am interested and glad to know
you on account of your excellent article in the sports-
man on the preservation of wild game im intensely
interested in the subject but what may i ask brought
you here sir esme i was not aware that there was a
vessel in sight when the santa ines ran into that terrific
whirlwind and now here you are with these other
the non-gravitational vortex



strangers aboard all thats left of the poor old santa
and if you wish to know what i was doing on a spanish
ship i was returning from the canaries where my yacht
had gone on the rocks

  sir esmes jaw gaped he was gazing at the man we
had known as harvey as though he had been a ghost
and i too was staring at him speechless with astonish-
ment the fellows lost memory had been miraculously
restored he remembered who he was where he had
been when disaster overtook him but-judging from his
words-lie could recall nothing that had occurred subse-
quent to the loss of the santa ines

  sir esme was the first to speak by jove he cried
either youre as crazy as a mad hatter or i am you
may be professor humiston-tll admit you might be
the king of dahomey or the president of argentina for
all i know to the contrary but to me youre harvey
the chap i picked up drifting damn near drowned off
the west indies and do you mean to tell me you never
met me before why by gad youve been with me
my man for-for-

  youre mad the other burst out cutting sir esmes
sentence short picked me up over by the antilles me
your valet hang it all you may be sir esme mc-
donald baronet but youre stark staring mad if you
say such tilings why good lord man here i am still
wet from my immersion still  all thats left of the
santa ines and you have the monumental nerve to tell
me that you picked me up a thousand miles from here
you-

  gentlemen please please wait a bit i begged them
as i saw sir esmes face flushing with anger let me
try to explain

  in as few words as possible i tried to make them
understand but it was hopeless to try to awaken their
memories harvey-no professor humiston had by
some freak of mind perhaps through shock perhaps
through some strange mysterious effect of the esme-
ismic area been restored to full and complete memory
of his life up to the time when the santa ines had met
with disaster which i was now firmly convinced had
been caused by a non-gravitational vortex exactly as the
loch lovern had been wrecked rut all subsequent
events his rescue his service with sir esme his life as
the mysterious ilarvey had all been wiped completely
from his memory

  on the other hand sir esme through the same shock
or the same effects of the force that had destroyed his
yacht had lost all memory of the events leading up to
the disaster and as i soon discovered he had not the
faintest recollection of having discovered esmeism of
having set out  a voyage to locate the esmeismic areas
more and most amazing of all he did not remember
anything whatsoever about his scientific work science
scientific terms conveyed  meaning to him he knew
less of science or at least no more  the subject than did
hobson the quartermaster all the months the years
he had devoted to scientific work were a blank to him
his other personality alexander macdonald had ceased
to exist even as a memory and only sir esme remained

indeed both he and professor humiston scoffed
openly at my attempts to convince them of the truth
they both regarded me as having become mentally de-
ranged from my experiences and each looked upon the
other as a bit mad and regarded himself as the only

really sane member of our shipwrecked party never-
theless they became good friends md presently ceased
arguing and turned their attention to the more pressing
and important matter of evolving some means of rescu-
ing ourselves from our precarious position very prob-
ably we might all have succumbed to thirst starvation
or other causes had it not been for hobson who remem-
bered the yachts position when he had last been at the
wheel and being an unusually observant fellow for a
common sailor and with ambitions to become a navi-
gator he had noticed that the chart showed a group of
small islands about two to three degrees south and a
degree and a half west of our position to attempt to
traverse nearly two hundred miles of ocean in a small
boat whose only means of propulsion was oars was a
somewhat dangerous undertaking not to mention the
hardships it would entail but with a seaworthy well-
built boat and in the calmest portion of the ocean it
was a far less hazardous matter than to remain upon a
drifting derelict that might never be sighted by a pass-
ing ship moreover we had no choice in the matter

   that same night a long slow swell came rolling out of
the east the waterlogged hulk rose and fell sluggishly
water washed over its all but submerged dccks and when
dawn burst in a blaze of glory over the vast expanse of
sea we found that the derelicts hours were numbered
during the night she had settled appreciably at an
moment the hatches might give way and she would then
plunge like a plummet to the bottom of the ocean so
having breakfasted  crackers cheese and wine we
clambered into the small boat and pushed off from the
pathetic hulk that within the next few hours would van-
ish forever

  and we were not a moment too soon scarcely were
we clear of the wreck when there was a rending tearing
explosion fragments of timbers and hatch covers flew
high in air water poured in torrents over the rent decks
and into the yawning hold and suddenly lifting her stem
in air she plunged beneath the waves but in that
moment that her battered counter had been raised clear
of the sea her name painted amid ornate scrolls across
her stern had been reveiued and with incredulous eyes
i had read santa ines barcelona it seemed im-
possible incredible utterly beyond belief harvey-no
professor humiston-had been right

  by some freak of fate he we had found refuge upon
the hulk of the ship from which he had been cast into the
sea of course he didnt appear in the least surprised
for he was utterly unaware that nearly two years had
passed since the santa ines had been left a battered hope-
less wreck by the phenomenon that had destroyed her
and had carried him-yes i was forced to believe it-
hundreds of miles across the ocean the lord only
knows what the effect might have been had sir esme
read the derelicts name but fortunately his head was
turned at the time and it escaped him but as he recalled
nothing of his theories and merely knew he had rescued
professor humiston from the sea  a distant part of
the ocean in all probability the revelation of the derelicts
name would merely have confirmed his belief in har-
veys- the professors-mental delusions

there is little more to tell in due time we reached
the islands little the worse for our long hazardous and
uncomfortable voyage they were uninhabited univit-
ing rocky islets but with some vegetation the homes

i landed from the steamer got my trunks
through the customs and on their way then i
hurried uptown and had a little dinner with my
old friend harrington after that i went home
to my apartment it was just the sort of an eve-
ning for a visit from von ho fen the sun had gone
down in one of those ghastly green sunsets that always
give me tlie creeps now it had begun to rain a slow
dreary drizzle accompanied by a whining wind that sug-
gested the gibbering of ghosts and all that sort of thing

  you may wonder why all this suggested a visit from
von hofen but you dont know von hofen he is the
finest old scout that ever lived and i havent a better
friend in tlie world but hang it he isnt human he
wont be offended when he reads this i have told him
the same thing hundreds of times and he only laughs
and says ach so i am no scientist im just a plain
money grubber and the things that von ilofen does with
induction coils and cathode rays and things of that sort
seem to me positively uncanny i cannot rid myself of
the feeling that there is something diabolical about it all

  i am not aslnmed of being a money grubber some-
body has to be that or the von hofens could never put
their ideas across and i am proud to say that my dollars
backing up von hofens brains have contributed much
to the pleasure and comfort of mankind

  i went to my book-casc for something to read the
first thing i got hold of was she it was just the
sort of an evening for rider haggard so i put that
bad the next was a volume of poes tales and it fell
open at the masque of the red death nice reading
for such a night  put that back too i needed a
sedative and was looking for carlyles french revolu-
tion which always puts me to sleep when the bell rang
it was von hofen of course

  well you old wizard i said what is it this time
and how much is it going to cost

  ach said he i have tlie so wonderful idea it will
shake the world radio television bah they are
as nothing i have already in the laboratory the oh so
small model it works but ach how it has cost my

car my house and-here he glanced down at his vest-
yes i have as you say hock my watch

  your car your house your watch i shouted

  yes he replied calmly but it is not enough so i
have come to you as soon as i hear the steamer is ar-
rived

  but why didnt you come to me before i stormed
ach but you were in europe i could not wait to try
out this so wonderful invention

  but i persisted why didnt you write or cable or
radio or something but you are a genius-an inventor
and of coiirsc you couldnt be expected to have a grain
of ordinary common sense come on lets go have a look
at your contraption

  my car was still in storage but i called a taxi which
soon dropped us at a dingy house over on second ave-
nue we descended the area steps von hofen un-
locked the grilled iron gate and then the door leading into
the basement hall he lighted the gas and unlocked a
third door opening into the underground room which was
von hofens laboratory here he proudly displayed the
working model of his latest invention to me it was only
a conglomeration of batteries wires glass tubes and coils
but von hofen entered upon a lengthy explanation which
i give here as well as i can in the hope that it may
mean more to some of you readers than it did to me

  i have discovered the great secret said von hofen
for which a long time the scientists have searched
all matter as you know is made up of atoms these
atoms they are composed of electrons and protons but
what arc these  ah that no one knows but von hofen

i have prove that they are nothing but vibrations i
have discover too that each element has its own vibra-
tion-its own wave length-and that these follow the
scale of atomic weights and the x-ray spectrum of the
so great moseley from hydrogen which is number one
to uranium which is numberhinety-two a compound
too is but one vibration made up of many yes but
only one ach how shall you understand but listen
you hear a great orchestra a hundred pieces brass
wood-wind strings each with many sound vibrations

amazing stories

many overtones many thousand vibrations of sound
you would say but no there is but one it can all
be contained in the so small groove of your phonograph
disc you start the record and in this one vibration
you hear again all the instruments it is the same with
the telephone the radio with this so wonderful inven-
tion of mine many vibrations and yet but one e
pluribus unitit is it not so though a compound should
contain all the elements-there can be but ninety-two-
it matters not it is not ninety-two vibrations but only
one

  when my so great invention i have complete there
will be a screen with ninety-two-what shall i say
lenses each lens shall take up the vibration of one
element good i place in the sending chamber let us
say the box of candy which you wish to send to your
sweetheart and turn on the current each element is
taken up by its own lens on the screen and passes into
the condensing globe where all arc focused into one ray
this ray shall fall upon a reversing screen at the re-
ceiving station and all parts shall be reassembled in the
same form as before shall you wish to go again to
europe you shall not take the steamer bio you shall
sit in the little chair in the sending chamber then i aim
the machine to shall we say london i turn it until the
little needle on the dial shall point to the london mark
if it is not point correctly the switch will not close i
turn on the current and pouf you are sitting in the little
chair before the receiving screen in london

  but i have not yet the screen i as you say went
broke for the screen one must have a substance which
is radioactive in this so small model i have use radium
it has but the one lens which will send but one element
iron see here is a ball of pure iron i place it here in
the sending chamber and close the switch the vibra-
tion of iron passes through this tube here into this glass
globe which is the condenser and sends the vibrations in
one beam-in one direction else there would be no more
iron but only vibrations spreading abroad through the
ether like rings in a pool into which you have throw a
stone now see

  he closed the switch there was a buzzing noise and
the glass tubes litup with blue light

  now said he shutting off the current you shall
find the little ball of iron before that screen  the other
side of the room

  it was there sure enough

  von ho fen laughed in triumph bul it will do some-
thing more something that will be of the greatest use
to the chemist here is a nail it is not iron it is steel
it contains carbon i place it in the machine and close
the switch see the iron goes to the screen but the
carbon is still here in the sending chamber so you see
this so wonderful machine can be use to analyze any com-
pound no matter how complex by using one lens at a
time until all the ninety-two shall have been tried it
can also in the same way produce any clement pure and
without adulteration

here von helen began a technical explanation of
just how the apparatus worked forgetting en-
tirely that he was speaking to one with only the most
rudimentary knowledge of science all of which was so
utterly greek to me that i cannot remember a word of it

  the money now being available to supply needed ma-
terials von hofen worked like a slave day in and day
out rapidly extending the scope of his operations from

iron he turned to other elements and then to simple
compounds advancing rapidly to those which were more
complex he was wild with delight when he succeeded
in sending a block of wood across the room proving that
so-called organic matter was not beyond the power nf his
machine to handle then came the wonderful day when
he succeeded in sending a dead cat across the laboratory
having accomplished this he was ready for the greatest
step in the development of the invention the step from
dead and inert materials to the living creature

  after several days of careful adjustment of the appa-
ratus he believed that everything was in shape and in-
sisted upon my being present at this crucial test a living
cat was placed in the sending chamber and the current
turned on i confess that i felt much like a schoolboy
speaking a piece and suffering from stage fright von
ilofens hand trembled so that he could hardly close the
switch unfortunately for the cat the experiment was
not a complete success the instrument being evidently
in need of further adjustment the animal arrived at
the receiving screen in apparently excellent shape ex-
cept that it was dead during the next week the mor-
tality rate among the cats in the neighborhood rose
alarmingly but just seven days after the first experi-
ment the cat a big maltese as i remember was found
at the receiving end contentedly purring and apparently
unaware that anything unusual had happened to her

  the next step was to rent a room in a shabby building
in the neighborhood called hells kitchen this place
had formerly been occupied as a gambling den it was
lined with sheet iron its heavy door was also rein-
forced with iron and defended by huge locks here we
installed an immensie receiving screen and experimented
with sending various objects across the city this un-
savory neighborhood was chosen for the double reason
that it was a desirable distance from the sending station
and was moreover in a section where strange actions
were unlikely to attract much attention from anyone ex-
cept possibly the police the fortified room moreover
rendered it less likely that inquisitive persons would
force their way into the place with consequent damage
to delicate apparatus costing many thousands of dollars
to install

  the culmination of this series of experiments brought
incidentally one of the greatest sensations which the city
had known for a long time by means of bank note di-
plomacy securing the connivance of the janitor of a
certain medical school we arranged to borrow a dead
man from the pickling vat pledging ourselves to re-
turn the same when we had done with it that was a
ghastly piece of work approaching the building at a
rear entrance and giving a preconcerted signal we were
admitted by our dusky co-conspirator of the dissecting
room where he was engaged at the time of our arrival
in the pleasant task of gathering up such fragments of
human remains as were no longer of use to be burned in
an incinerator in the basement all about stretched 
slabs were awful shapes that made my flesh creep
some were covered some were not some were entire
some decidedly not i fell like a ghoul from the vat
at the rear of this cheerful place a prospective subject
was fished with the assistance of the janitor bundled up
and conveyed to the car waiting by the door taking ad-
vantage of the time between the rounds of the police-
man on the beat with our unpleasant passenger we
sped to the basement laboratory on second avenue
smuggled it in and placed it in the sending chamber of
element 



the full-sized machine which had now taken the place oe
the little working model of a few months before

  the whole experience was so weird so smacking of
witchcraft sorcery and that sort of thing that to this
day i get goose flesh when i think about it we placed
the dead man in the chair securing him in a sitting posi-
tion by means of bits of insulated wire that lay scattered
about the place i can see him now that grisly dead
man sitting in that chair surrounded by tubes coils
and all sorts of mysterious apparatus his sunken eyes
were open staring von hofen seemed if possible even
more nervous than i  remember that when either of us
spoke which was not often it was in a whisper or in
such low tones as one might use in addressing a fellow
mourner at a funeral new and powerful induction coils
had been provided and current at a high voltage had
displaced the  volts of former experiments

  yon hofen went over the entire machine tightening
a binding screw here adjusting something there i feel
pretty ccrtain that all this was more for the purpose of
delaying the crucial moment until he could get control
of his nerves than for any other reason all was ready
in dead silence von hofen threw the switch the whole
apparatus quivered as the current roared between anode
and cathode the room was flooded with ghastly blue
light and the air was heavy with the smell of ozone
while von ho fens hand was still clutching the switch
the sending chamber was empty

  von hofen jerked open the switch and we rushed
from the room to the street never stopping to turn out
the light and slamming doors behind us as we went i
heard the clang of the iron gate as i reached the top of
the area steps we leaped into the waiting car and sped
in defiance of the traffic laws i fear to the house on
tenth avenue up the stairway we raced as though
the police were after us von hofens hands shook so
that he could hardly get the key into the lock we
flung the door open and snapped on the light a horrible
sight met our eyes the body was there but in a condi-
tion which it would be idle even to attempt to describe
scrambled is the only word that i can think of which
can even faintly suggest it the features were grotesque-
ly misplaced as were the arms and legs but this was not
the worst the entire structure had been shifted so to
speak i have no doubt that a microscopic examination
would have shown that not a cell of the entire organism
had retained its proper shape and position the result
was something which had certainly never been seen
before in the history of the world i cannot even hint
at its appearance

  as we had promised to return the body to the pickling
vat there was nothing to do but to bundle up the thing
and smuggle it back to the medical school get it into the
vat without anyone having seen it and leave future
events to take care of themselves we managed to ac-
complish this without permitting our janitor friend to
look at the gruesome object when therefore it should
turn up in the dissecting room there would be nothing
to connect it with the subject ve had borrowed

  a few days later the creature was fished from the
vat and placed upon a slab and then the fireworks began
the medicos declared that it was utterly impossible that
such a being could have survived to reach maturity but
there it was tobe accounted for no one knew whence
it had come and every effort to trace it back to its source
so to speak resulted in failure the morgue emphatically
denied all knowledge of it a storm of discussion arose

physicians and surgeons from all parts oi the country
flocked to inspect it and add their conjectures to the
mass of conflicting opinion a noted chemist offered
the suggestion that the astounding condition observed
had been caused in some manner by the liquid in the
pickling vat but as the other subjects in the vat showed
no signs of distortion this theory was not generally
accepted

  the newspapers devoted their front pages to the
morbid details one sunday edition contained a whole
page of pseudo-scientific hokum with blood-curdling il-
lustrations gravely discussing the probability oi the crea-
tures having come on a meteorite or from mars then
a millionaire eloped with his stenographer the front page
and the public turned their attention to that and the
incident was forgotten exccpt by a few medical men
who no doubt are still puzzling over it

  for the first time in all my acquaintance with him
i found von hofen dejected and discouraged

  i can do no more said he the screen must be
radioactive i have used radium but it is-how shall
i express it too coarse there is no known element that
can take its place there is one number eighty-seven in
the scale it comes next to radium in the periodic table
that i am sure would do  but it has never been dis-
covered there is only one man in all the world whom i
could depend upon to find it for us he is the greatest
of all chemists fame wealth what you will might be
his but he has the evil heart he is even now in prison

  prison doors can be opened i said i will stop
short of nothing but murder to put this thing across
who is he where is he

  he was it seemed one professor john carson whose
residence at the time was one of those neat and compact
little apartments up in ossining prison

  now i am a normally law-abiding citizen but in this
instance it appeared to me that the success of von
hofens invention was of such immense importance to
mankind as to justify a ccrtain waiving of legal techni-
calities as long as nobody was actually harmed thereby
if such should be necessary here was evidently a case
where bank-note diplomacy was again called for by
such diplomatic means therefore i secured the coopera-
tion of a turnkey or two when that had been accom-
plished the rest was comparatively easy

i had a long interview with professor carson in
which i made certain propositions to him which he
accepted with alacrity at the same time t took careful
note of his personal appearance manner of speech size
and approximate weight as they appeared to me from
personal observation i also sccurcd exact data on these
points together with a photograph from the prison files
the next thing was to find a man answering as closely as
possible to the general description of carson whose
financial status was such as to render it worth his while
to do two years time for a few thousand dollars
this required a little delay but the man was finally
found

  this man was admitted to carsons cell where they
exchanged clothing at the end of the call carson
walked out unsuspected leaving his visitor to serve the
balance of his term carson was given clearly to under-
stand that his freedom was only to last as long as he
played square with us and that at the first sign of
crooked work means would be found for getting him
once more behind the bars
 

amazing stories

   these little details having been attended to a fully
equipped laboratory was provided for the use of our
chemist at my expense as i watched him at work i
full rather proud to be the owner of all that collection of
furnaces beakers retorts and crooked glassware even
though i had no remotest notion what any of it was for

   in the matter of zeal carson left nothing to be desired
he was in his element seemingly fascinated by his task
and he threw himself heart and soul into his work which
he loved better than anything else on earth-except
crime on one occasion at least he remained for a full
twenty-four hours in the laboratory fascinated by some
experiment which he was conducting never leaving it to
eat or sleep and then one day he came into the base-
ment room on second avenue with a beaker containing
a handful of something that resembled coal ashes more
than anything else i can think of

   here said he is a concentrate containing the sub-
stance we are looking for from its position in the
periodic table i was convinced that it would be found
in one of the radioactive ores accompanied by and prob-
ably overshadowed by radium yesterday i found un-
mistakable traces of it and by working all last night i
finally obtained this i could no doubt separate the
element in my laboratory but with the aid of von hofen
here i think we can save considerable time in the
corner over there is a small model of the projector
which i understand has but one lens as von hofen
calls it tuned for iron if von hofen will provide us
with a small lens tuned for the purpose we can separate
out the element we desire more quickly and probably in
a purer state than i could obtain it in my laboratory

  in a few hours the desired screen was at hand the
concentrate was placed in the sending chamber of the
little projector and the small receiving screen was set up
in its old place at the end of the room when the switch
was closed i could observe no difference in the appear-
ance of the concentrate but on the little tray before the
receiving screen was scattered a greyish powder per-
haps a teaspoon ful altogether

  dont touch it warned carson it is not as de-
structive as radium i am certain but i shouldnt care
to handle it with bare hands until we know more about
it he poured the powder into a small leaden phial
which he held out toward us with a dramatic gesture
here it is he said element number  discov-
ered by me john carson and which i have taken the
liberty of naming after myself carsonium and here
-producing a small note-book-is the formula

  carsonium to our great delight proved to be all
that we had hoped for the invention was a success
now came the supreme test-to send a living man from
the basement room on second avenue to the iron-walled
room on tenth avenue here even von hofen hesi-
tated what if something should go wrong and the
subject of the experiment should arrive at the receiver
a scrambled monstrosity like that which had so upset the
medical world a few months before the machine was
ready and tuned to the highest degree of accuracy and
yet we delayed

  the more i saw of carson the less i liked or trusted
him

  von hofen i said one day are you sure that the
formula which carson gave you is genuine

  von hofen started a troubled look came over his
face i had not thought of that said he but this
night will i go to the laboratory and try il out i am not

so much of a chemist as carson but a little of a chemist
yes enough to test the formula we sliall see

  that night taking the little note-book from its place in
the safe we went to carsons laboratory which had not
been used since the completion of his experiments here
von ilofen opened the book and began to mumble over
the figures which it contained as he did so his brow
wrinkled into a deep frown

  hss  ifei -- kno -i- h- in a lew

moments he threw down the note-book it is but non-
sense he said a jumble of chemical symbols it
means nothing he makes fools of us let us search
perhaps the real formula is concealed here i thought
it most unlikely nevertheless we ransacked the place
thoroughly even examining the contents of a waste bas-
ket which stood by the desk it is hardly necessary to
say that we found nothing

  day was breaking when at last we returned to the
second avenue basement where we sat down for a
council of war

  von hofen i said you can bet your last dollar
that that formula is resting safe aud sound in carsons
pocket by hook or by crook by violence if necessary
we must get it from him in the meantime we must not
let him suspect that we have discovered the one he gave
us to be a fraud if he knows that we even suspect it
the game is all up with that formula in liis possession
he has us by the throat he can demand what terms he
pleases now what i would suggest is this-

  good morning gentlemen said a voice at the door
what is the trouble you seem worried about some-
thing has anything gone wrong with the projector
it was carson wearing upon his face a sarcastic smile
which would have justified murder

  so lie went on you thought you could outwit pro-
fessor john carson you amuse me the formula is
mine and the machine is mine last night while you
were busy in my laboratory i was busy in yours i
made a careful study of all plans blueprints and data
regarding this most ingenious invention and i think i
am now as familiar with its details as von hofen himself
however to guard against any possible failure of
memory on my part i took possession of all said plans
and data and have them now in my coat pocket check-
mate 

  von hofen quickly spun the combination and threw
open the door of the safe it was empty

  carson laughed

  as i turned with clenched fists he was standing be-
tween us and the door with a revolver in his hand you
spoke a moment ago said he of my dictating terms
you wrong me t have no intention of doing anything of
the sort why should i make terms when i can have it
all i shall make short work of both of you right now
and send your remains by air route to the room on tenth
avenue they will be discovered on the street later on
and what is there to connect them with me but no
there is an even more effectual way of disposing of
them i have only to-

he did not go on with his explanation he was so
pleased with his cleverness and so much amused
by the little lecture he was giving us that he became a bit
careless i seized the opportunity and sprang upon him
striking at the hand which held the revolver he fired
but the ball buried itself harmlessly in the ceiling at
the same instant von hofen leaped to my assistance i
element 



was amazed at the strength that seemed to be in the old
fellows lean frame and i myself am no wealding hut
carson was like a thing of steel springs and wire

  the revolver was knocked to the floor and the three
of us staggered about the room fighting like demons i
have not the slightest doubt but that carson could have
managed the two of us but in the struggle he stepped
upon the fallen revolver which slipjpbd along the floor
throwing him off his balance he fell violently against
the projector his head striking the heavy iron frame
for a moment he was partially stunned that moment
was enough before he could recover himself we had
him down i tied his wrists and ankles with some pieces
of heavy copper wire which lay upon the floor and we
buuud him securely to the chair in the sending chamber
of the projector von ilofen threw the switch the
current roared the blue light flared and he was gone

  now said von hofen we must get an officer he
is in the room on tenth avenue bound hand and foot

we must get the formula from him and then-

  and then i finished we will get him back into
prison by the same means that got him out but why in
thunder didnt we get that formula while we had him
here come on

  soon accompanied by an officer we were hurrying
westward we unfastened the iron door of the receiving
room and rushed in the room was empty

  he is a devil said von hofen let us go

  sadly we returned to the basement room where stood
the now useless transmitter-useless because we had con-
sumed the last of our carsonium in getting rid of its
discoverer and we could produce no more

  my friend said von hofen we are dead men

how we escaped from that room i cannot guess but he
has made similar escapes before somewhere he is lurk-
ing by knife by gun by poison in some way he will
accomplish his purpose i knew what he was i should
have known better we should have left him in prison

  nonsense said i we will have the whole police
force of the city and the whole pinkerton detective
agency into the bargain on his track we will get him
well see this thing through or-

  i stopped for von hofen was not listening he stood
staring at a bit of wire which dangled from the projector
he took the end of the wire in his hand and turned to
me with a most peculiar smile upon his face

  you will not need the police he said nor the detec-
tive agency this so small wire which is now broken
carried the current to the condenser carson must have
broken it when he fell against the machine we placed
him in the sending chamber turned  the current and
poui  ive have broadcast him

  so somewhere out in interstellar space the vibrations
of professor john carson and his formula are traveling
on and on in ever-widening circles into infinity he will
not return

  and now my reason for telling the story just this
if any of you chemical fellows happen to be on the trail
of element number  and need a bit of inducement
beyond the hope of having it named smithium or
joncsium in your honor let me say that in a basement
room on second avenue new york city there stands
the greatest invention of all time useless as a rolls poyce
out of gas awaiting the rediscovery of that element arid
there is also waiting at my bank in the same city a re-
ward of ten thousand dollars in cash for the finder

author of when the atoms failed and the metal horde

nce again our young author offers us a rare combination of accurate science
- with excellently written fiction it is perfectly possible to get sunburned in a
dark room into which only ultra-violet rays of light-so called-penetrate the
same rays can make some substances visible and fail to do so with others a word
can be written with a colorless clear solution so as to be completely invisible on
paper except under the proper light why tkerefore is it not possible to go
ahead of these phenomena and penetrate further into the secrets of invisibility and
visibility mr campbell in looking ahead to the future of aviation propounds
some ingenious ideas always based on sound scientific fact as to the possibilities
of this most interesting of subjects-aviation this is an excellent bit of scientific
fiction

igh in the deep blue of the afternoon sky
rode a tiny speck of glistening metal
scarce visible in the glare of the bright
sun the workers on the machines below
glanced up for a moment-four twenty-
one it must be--then bade to their work though little
enough it was on these automatic cultivators even this
little break in the afternoon program was of interest
in this dull monotony of green but they would soon
be starting back to the plantation city these endless
fields of castor bean plants had to be cultivated but
with the great machines tliat did the work ii required
but a few dozen men to cultivate an entire county
indeed so vast yas the area that little helicopters were
even now resting on the big cultivator that they might
fly back at the end of the day leaving the machine where
it was ready to use in the morning

  high above them the passengers of die huge plane
looked down for a moment perhaps but continued with
their papers or books immediately tor this long monot-
onous trip was most annoying to them it seemed
unnecessary to spend six good hours in a short -
mile trip like this there was nothing to do either
not like the trans-pacific liners for though they spent
nearly ten hours in flight they at least had dub rooms
and a swimming pool- there was nothing to do noth-
ing to see except a slowly passing landscape ten miles
below no details could be distinguished and the steady
low throb of the engines the whirring of the giant
propellers the muffled roar of the air as it rushed by
combined to form a soothing lullaby of power it was
all right for pleasure seekers and vacationists but the
business man was in a hurry

  the pilot of the machine took a last glance at the

instruments wondered vaguely why he had to he there
at all then turned left the pilot room in charge of his
assistant and went down to talk with the chief engineer

  his vacation began the first of sol and as this was
the last of june he was still rather wondering what
would have happened if he had done as he had been
half inclined to do-quit the trip and let the assistant
take her through it would have been very simple-
just a few levers to manipulate a few controls to set
and the instruments would have taken her up to ten or
eleven miles swung her into the great westward air
current and leveled her off at five hundred and sixty
or so an hour toward frisco they would hold her
on the radio beacon course better than he ever could
even the landing would have been easy the assistant
had never landed a big plane but if he had been shown
which control to reset the instruments would do it
if he forgot his instructions he would merely have to
leave it alone and in ten minutes it would land auto-
matically-if an emergency pilol didnt come up by
that time in answer to the automatic signal

  he yawned and sauntered down the hall he yawned
again wondered what made him so sleepy-he hadnt
been out the night before-oh-why-worry-

  he slumped limply to the floor and lay there breath-
ing even more and more slowly

  the officials of the san francisco terminus of the
transcontinental airways company were worried the
great transcontinental express had come to the fidd
following the beam radio signals and now it was cir-
cling the field with a small red-and-white flag flying
the automatic signal for an emergency pilot they were
worried and with good reason for on this express a
large shipment of negotiable securities was being sent




amazing stories

there were nearly nine hundred thousand dollars worth
of bonds but what could attack one of those giant
ships it would take a small army to overcome the
crew of seventy and the three thousand passengers

  the great ship was landing gently now the long
series of broad rollers on its keel touching the ground
evenly its tremendous weight distributed over a great
area lest it sink into the springy rubber-faced landing
surface

  the small field car ran over to the great plane rapidly
already the elevator was in place beside it and as
the officials in the car drew up under the giant wing
they could see the tiny figure of the emergency pilot
beckoning to them quickly they entered the portable
elevator and were carried rapidly up to the fourth level
of the ship

  what a sight met their eyes as they entered the
main salon of the giant plane all the passengers lay
sleeping in their chairs but on closer examination it
bccame evident that they were not breathing the ear
could detect no heart-beat the members of the crew
lay at their posts as inert as the passengers the
assistant pilot lay on the floor beside the instrument
panel-he had apparently been watching the record of
the flight but there was no conscious man on board

  dead over three thousand people it seems im-
possible-how could they have done it gas i sup-
pose drawn in through the ventilator pumps and
distributed to all the compartments of the ship but
i can not conceive of any man being willing to kill three
thousand people for a mere million

  did you call a doctor by radio pilot the field
manager was greatly depressed

  yes sir he is on his way there is his car now

  of course they will have opened the safe-but let
us see how it was done i can only think some mad-
man has done this-no sane man would be willing to
take so many lives for so little wearily the men
descended the stairs to the mail room in the hold

  the door was closed but the lock of the door was
gone apparently the magnesium-berylium alloy had been
burned away they opened the door and entered the
room seemed in perfect order the guard was asleep
in the steel guard chamber at one side it seemed from
the doorway the thick bullet-proof glass made his
outlines a little blurred and the color of his face was
green-but they knew there too must be that same white
pallor they had seen on the faces of the passengers and
crcw the delicate instruments had brought in the
great ship perfectly but it was freighted with a cargo
of dead they entered the room further and pro-
ceeded to the safe hut it was opened as they had ex-
pected the six-inch tungsto-iridium wall had been melted
through to the worried and depressed men this did
not bring the surprise it ordinarily would have they
only glanced at the metal still too hot to touch and
looked about the room the bonds had been taken
but now they noticed that over the mail-clerks desk
there had been fastened a small envelope on it was
printed

to the officials of the san fkancisco airport

  inside was a short message printed in the same sharp
black letters

 to the officials of the san francisco airport

    this plane should land safely if it doesnt
 it is your fault not mine for the instruments
 that it carries should permit it the passen-
 gers are not dead they have been put in
 a temporary state of suspended animation
 any doctor can readily revive them by the in-
 jection of seven ce of deci-normal potassium
 iodide solution for every  pounds of weight
 do not use higher concentrations lower
 concentrations will act more slowly

    you will find that any tendency toward lep-
 rosy or cancer will have been destroyed it
 will kill any existing cancer and cure it in
 about one week i have not experimented with
 leprosy beyond knowing that it is cured very
 quickly

   this is an outside job dont bother the
 people in the car

    the gas used cannot be stopped by any ma-
 terial i know of you can try it with any
 mask-but dont use the g-l it will react
 with the gas to produce a permanent suspen-
 sion of animation i would advise that you
 try it on an animal to convince yourselves

    i have left stock in my new company to re-
 place the bonds i have taken

    piracy incorporated is incorporated under
 my own laws

                               the pirate

 on the desk beneath the note was a small package
 which contained a number of stock certificates they
 totalled  listed apparently as piracy pre-
 ferred the stock of the new corporation piracy inc
 piracy pirates in the air in  we have a
 pirate attacking our air lines but thank god he did
 not kill all those people piracy preferred well i
 think i would prefer the bonds myself but if the air
 guard cant catch that fellow im going to buy up his
 stock from present appearances it looks to me as if it
 would pay big dividends ah doctor you look wor-
 ried  no wonder but cheer up if what this pirate
 says is true we can resuscitate them and they will be
 better off for the experience

 i am afraid that you will never be able to bring
 those men back to life again sir i cant detcct any
 heart action even with the amplifier ordinary heart
 action sounds like a cataract through this instrument
 i can see nothing wrong with the blood it has not
 coagulated as i cxpccted nor is there any pronounced
 hydrolysis as yet but i am afraid i will have to write
 out the death warrants for all those men and women
 one of the people on that ship was coming to see me
 that is how i happened to be on the field perhaps
 it is better so that poor woman was suffering from
 an incurable canccr

 in this case doctor i hope and believe you are
 wrong read this note

 it was two hours before the work of reviving the
 passengers could be begun despite all the laws of
 physics their body temperature had remained constant
 after it reached seventy-four showing that some form
 of very slow metabolism was going on as they were
 one by one put into the large electric blankets and each
 given the correct dose of the salt the men waited anx-
 iously for results-and within ten minutes of the injec-
 tion the first had regained consciousness 
piracy preferred



  the work went forward steadily and successfully
every one of the passengers and crew was revived and
the pirate had spoken the truth the woman who had
been suffering from cancer was free from pain for the
first time in many months she was cured

  the papers were issuing extras within five minutes
of the time the great plane was landed and the radio
news service was broadcasting the first break in a par-
ticularly dead month all this june the news had been
dead and now it looked as though the month of sol
was going to begin with a bang and now with time
to think and investigate the airport officials went over
the ship with the air guard using a fine-tooth comb
it was soon evident that the job had been done from
the outside as the pirate had said it was the emergency
pilot testified that when he entered he found a small
piecc of wire securing the air lode from the outside
this had certainly been put on while the ship was in
flight and that meant that whoever had done this had
landed on the great ship with a small plane anchored it
in some way then entered the plane through the air
lock at the ten-mile height that required that he
should wear a suit to protect him both from the intense
cold and from the low pressure he had probably flown
across the path of the plane with his plane leaving a
trail of the gas in its way to be drawn in through the
ventilator pumps it had been washed out by the in-
coming good air later for the officials had not been
affected nor had the emergency pilot been acted on when
he entered

  now the investigation led them to the mail-room
the door had been opened by melting or burning out the
lock the heat of the combustion of the magnesium
was enough for that but the berylium and special anti-
combustion catalyst made this very difficult but now
they realized the truly amazing fact the safe had been
opened by melting it through there was practically
no oxidation of the cut itself but the metal near by
which had been incandescent no doubt was coated with
a thin layer of tungsten oxide the iridium content
really prevented oxidation and with a melting point of
 degrees centigrade it meant that the pirate must
have an entirely new torch this would be as great
a boon to the metallurgical industries as the cancer curc
would be to the medical it had been impossible to weld
the valuable tungsten alloys they had prepared and so
they were useless if they could only be worked their
ability to stand high temperatures would make them
invaluable

  a bond shipment was due the next day and so
they svould lie on the watch for it it would get through
safely for men were put on board in steel tanks hermeti-
cally welded behind them with oxygen tanks sealed
within to supply them with clean air automatic ap-
paratus was arranged to keep them supplied with the
correct amount of oxygen without effort on their part
the waste gases were collected by alkali a small elec-
trically driven pump taking care that the flow was
maintained the front of the tank was equipped with
a bullet-proof glass window arid by means of electrically
operated controls the man inside could control a ma-
chine-gun thus he was perfectly protected from the
pirates gas and able to use his gun

  the ship was accompanied by a patrol of air guards-
men yet several cancer cases were going with the
hope of being gassed

  it seemed that the pirates patients were due to be
disappointed ihough for he certainly could not attack
while the plane was under the protection of a patrol of
air guardsmen besides which the men inside were
protected by the steel tanks

  when the plane readied the neighborhood of san
francisco the air guardsmen were disappointed for
there had been no sign of an attack on the plane the
pirate might well retire permanently on a million if he
were alone as the singular signature would indicate
hut it seemed doubtful and it was much more probable
that he would attempt another attack in any case well
that just meant watching all the planes from now on
that was a tremendous job for the air guard to handle
there was a vast network of plane lines the leader
of the patrol turned in an easy bank to descend the ten
miles to earth and his planes followed him then out
of the corner of his eye he saw a flash of red and
while on the silvery surface of the giant plane the
plane was giving the automatic signal fok an
emergency pilot  that could only mean that the plane
had been gassed under the very eyes of his men

  the bonds were gone and the passengers gassed but
incredible as it was the men aboard in the steel tanks
were as thoroughly gassed as the rest the note was
brief but as much to the point as was the absence of
the bonds

       to the officials of the airport
  restore as usual the men in die tanks are
  asleep also-i said this gas would penetrate
  any material it does a mask obviously wont
  do any good as the gas will permeate the skin
  dont try that c-l mask i warn you it will
  be fatal my gas reacts to produce a poison-
  ous substance when in contact with the chemi-
  cals used

                               the pirate

on the thirty-ninth floor of a large new york
apartment two young men were lounging about
after a strenuous game of tennis the bine curls of
smoke from their pipes rose slowly to be drawn away
by the efficient ventilating system the taller of the
two seemed to be doing most of the talking in the
positions they had assumed it would have been rather
difficult to be sure of which was the taller but william
morey was a good four inches taller than richard
arcot arcot had to suffer under the stigma of runt
with morey around-he was only six feet tall but die
chosen occupation of each was physical research and
in that arcot could well have called morey runt for
arcot had only one competitor in that field-namely
his father in this case it had been like father like
son for many years robert arcot had been known
as the greatest american physicist and probably the
worlds greatest more recently he had been known as
the father of the worlds greatest physicist arcot junior
was probably one of the most brilliant men the world
had ever seen and he was aided in all his work by two
men who could help him in a way that amplified his
powers a thousand fold his father and his best friend
morey were the complementary and balancing minds to
his great intelligence his father had learned through
years of work the easiest and best ways of performing
the many difficult feats of laboratory experimentation
morey had a mind that could develop the mathematical


amazing stories

theory of a hypothesis far more readily than arcot
could morey had a mind more methodical and exact
than arcot hut arcot had a mind that could grasp
the broad details of a problem and get the general
method of solution developed with a speed that made
it utterly impossible for his friend to even follow the
steps he suggested

  since arcot juniors invention of the multiple calculus
many new ramifications of the old theories had been
attained and many developments had been possible

  but the factor that made arcot most successful in
his line of work was his ability to see practical uses
for things an ability that is unfortunately lacking in so
many great physicists had he collected the royalties
his inventions merited he would have been a billionaire
twice or thrice over instead he had made contracts
on the basis that the laboratories he owned be kept
in condition and that he be paid a salary that should
be whatever he happened to need since he had sold
all his inventions to the transcontinental airways he
had been able to devote all his time to science leaving
them to manage his finances perhaps it was the fact
that he did sell these inventions to the transcontinental
that made these lines so successful but at any rate presi-
dent arthur morey was duly grateful and when his
sou was able to enter the laboratories he was as de-
lighted as arcot

  now these two were boon companions they worked
played lived and thought together

  just now they were talking about the pirate this
was the seventh day of his discovery and he had been
growing steadily more menacing it was the great trans-
continental airways that had suffered most repeatedly
sometimes it was the san francisco flyer that went
on without a pilot sometimes the new york-st louis
expresses that would come over the field flying the
red-and-white flag of emergency but always the
people were revived with little difficulty and each time
more of the stock of piracy inc was accumulated
the air guard seemed helpless time and again the
pirate slipped in without their knowing it each time
he convinced them that it was an outside worker for
the door was always sealed

  dick how do you suppose he gets away with the
things he does right under the eyes of those air guards-
men he must have some system he does it every
time

  i have a very vague idea i was going to ask you
today ii your father would let us take passage on the
next liner carrying any money i understand the in-
surance rates have been boosted so high that they dont
dare to send any cash by air any more they have
resorted to the slow land routes t guess they pay for it
though in the loss of interest while the money is out of
circulation is there any money shipment in sight

  no but i have something that is just as good if
not better for our purpose the other day several
men came into dads office to charter a plane to carry
them to san francisco and dad naturally wondered
why it was they had been referred to the president of
the company it seemed to him to be a job for a clerk
it seems the difficulty was that these men wanted to hire
the ship so they could be robbed a large group of
medical men and cancer victims were going for the
treatments each one of the twenty-five hundred go-
ing was to bring along one hundred dollars that meant

a total of a quarter of a million dollars which is to be left
on the table they hoped the pirate would gas them
and thus cure them dad could not officially do this
but told them that if there were too many people for
the san francisco express two sections would be neces-
sary so i believe that they are going on that second
section only one hundred dollars it seems a very
cheap cure for cancer at that

  another thing dad asked me to tell you that he
would appreciate your help in stopping this ultra-modern
pirate so if you go down and sec him in the morn-
ing you will doubtless be able to make the necessary
arrangements

  i will do so gladly i wonder though if you know
more about this than i do did they try that c-l
mask on any animal

  the pirate was telling the truth they tried it on
a dog and he went to sleep forever but do you have
any idea how that gas does ail it does

  i dont know what that gas is but i can tell you
some tilings that you may not know did you know
for instance that carbon monoxide will seep through a
solid plate of red-hot steel that has been known for
some three hundred years now and i have to hand it
to this pirate for making use of it even in the war
of  they didnt think of it he has just found
some gas that has these sleep-producing properties in
very low concentrations and at the same time is able
to penetrate to an even greater extent than carbon
monoxide it is just an amplification of known
properties

  i was wondering how he stores that stuff it re-
minds me of the old farmer and his smart son who had
almost discovered the universal solvent

   well son said the old farmer i suppose itll be
a durned good thing ta have but what you going to
keep it in similarly if this gas leaks through every-
thing what are you going to keep il in i wonder if
he doesnt make it as fast as he uses it by allowing
the two constituents to react it might well be simple
enough to store them separately and the airstream blow-
ing past him would carry the gas behind him so per-
mitting him to lay a stream of it in front of the big plane
is that about it

  that was about what i had figured one of the
things i want to do when i go with that invalid special
tomorrow is to get some samples for analyses

  whew thats a pretty big order isnt it dick
how are you going to handle it or even get it into your
apparatus 

  easily enough as far as getting the sample goes
i have already had some sample bottles made i have
one of them in the lab-excuse me a moment arcot
left the room to return a few minutes later with a large
aluminum bottle this bottle has been pumped out
to a very good vacuum i then swept it out with helium
gas then it was pumped out again i hope to take
this into some gas-filled region where the gas will be
able to leak in but the air wont when it comes to
going out again the gas will have to fight air pressure
and will probably stay in i cannot hope to find its mo-
lecular weight by any normal means probably the pirate
doesnt know it-hut i will be able to get a known
weight of the sample the weight being the difference
between the weight before and after the gas attack that
is why i used helium in sweeping the bottle out it
piracy preferred



will not be in the compound that is certain it is ab-
solutely impossible for it to combine it will weigh
very little and wont offset my readings and wont react
with the gas itself i cant hope to learn much that
will be very useful for the organic tables are so blamed
complex that a mere empirical formula wont mean a
thing ch is the formula for ethyl alcohol-or its
the formula for methyl ether it may be a single
double or triple bonded compound-but i cant tell i
will be able to get the empirical formula though for
any organic compound is apt to decompose easily and
i will just heat my cylinder in a furnace till the gas
is broken down then it will be easy to analyze the
residue

  i am not a chemist you know that but i know
that the amount of gas you will get in that bottle will
not weigh as much as a gram now how do you
intend to analyze that

  they have been making analysis runs on such small
amounts of compounds that they had to use powerful
lenses in watching the reactions two hundred years
ago an austrian developed micro-analysis remember
that in organic chemistry it is frequently necessary to
make an analysis of some substance that has been de-
rived only after many long months of hard work fre-
quently the entire sample will weigh not more than a
hundredth of a gram the chemist must run at least
three or four analyses on that he had to work with
pinhead amounts it will be no great amount of labor
for jackson to work it out it will probably irritate
his chemists soul to make an analysis and have to
stop at the empirical formula but i dont see how he
can do any more

  beautiful scheme i hope you can find out some-
thing about it

the next morning saw arcot in president moreys
private office having a long conference with him
at the end of it he left the office ascended to the
roof and climbed into his small helicopter rose to the
local traffic level and waiting his chance broke into the
traffic bound for the great airfields over in the jersey
district a few minutes later he landed on the roof
of the transcontinental airways shops entered them
and went to the office of the designing engineer john
fuller an old schoolmate they had been able to help
each other before for fuller had not paid as much at-
tention to theoretical physics as he might have and
though he was probably one of the outstanding aero-
nautical designers he often consulted arcot on the few
theoretical details that he needed probably it was
arcot who derived the greatest benefit from this asso-
ciation for the ability of the designer had many times
brought his theoretical successes to practical commercial
production now however he was consulting fuller
because the plane he was to take that afternoon for
san francisco was to be slightly changed for him

  he stayed in fullers office for the better part of
an hour then returned to the roof and thence to his
own roof where morey junior was waiting for him

  hello dick i heard from dad that you were
going this afternoon and came over here i got your
note and i have the tilings fixed up here the plane
leaves at one and it is ten-thirty now lets eat lunch
or its equivalent and then start dad asked me to
see how good that engineer on this plane is at explain-

ing the stuff you know the engineers are supposed
to be able to tell those visitors who have passes all
about it i am going to try to get there early and we
have passes-john smith is yours and mine is charles
black lets see-well be english

  it was half-past eleven when they reached the flying
field they went directly to the private office which
had been assigned to them aboard it was right next
to the mail-room and through the wall between the
two a small hole had been cut directly beneath this
hole was a table on which the two men now set up a
small moving-picture camera they had brought with
them

  how many of the gas sample bottles did you bring
bill asked arcot

  jackson had only four ready so i brought those
i think that will be enough from what he said have
we got that camera in place right now

  everythings o k i believe lets see your
engineer

  the chief engineer was lounging about in a large
chair in his cabin the walls of the little metal room
were lined with meters and rheostat controls he wished
they would get started he was a little disgruntled at
present his mates had been kidding him at the lunch
room-he was now chief engineer of the invalids fly-
ing wheel chair he was rather glad to be gassed
on these trips it made the trip even shorter he
glanced up at the long rows of meters and smiled
what did they spend all that money for no one ever
paid any attention to those things except once in every
month when the planes were run by the shop specialists
then they checked things up but the automatic devices
managed the whole thing anyway his principal duty
lay in keeping his men at the engines and inspecting
the apparatus occasionally but if anything went
wrong-a plane had had trouble three years ago and
descended to the six-mile level before the engineer
had been able to get the machines working correctly
again no hum-hullo-some visitors well here
was a little diversion while he waited for the starting
signal english they were

  president morey sent us to see you we are trying
to collect some material on american lines and we
are touring your country we would greatly appreciate
it if you would just tell us the story from the beginning
hmmm friends of the president himself-well-

  th be glad to help you all i can mr smith what
would you like to see first

  well i think wed best see the engines first if
possible

  all right sir i guess we can go down to the main
engine room in the nose of the ship this is the chief
engineers control room that board there represents
the main engine it covers most of that side of the
room there are most of the controlling relays for
starting and running it the engines are really run
by the control mechanisms you know those were begun
over two hundred years ago and through that time they
have passed through all the stages first they were
indicators watched by men who then acted on their
information then about that time relays were de-
veloped to control the action of the big planes that de-
veloped the first of these was the do-x the one
they have in the national teutonic museum they got
so big one man couldnt handle them and then the


amazing

stories

relays took over the job by that time the instruments
had become more accurate and they just hooked the
relays directly to the instruments

  now we have these ships each airline has a radio
beam station at each end and several scattered along
the way these direct the instruments which control the
direction of the ship the height is controlled by the
radio reflection altimeter this gives us ground height
the altitude from the ground itself not from sea level-
it makes it possible for these big planes to land them-
selves automatically the plane will no doubt be gassed
as you probably know and it will then continue its way
controlled automatically freight lines frequently op-
erate that way during rush periods no pilot goes on
them and no crew there is a landing beacon that
projects a radio wave from the exact center of the
field the plane heads for this then lands gently
a fall of a foot or so is easily taken care of by the
shock absorbers

  you noticed the roller landing gear that has
not been adopted widely abroad as yet but it makes
for easier landings the weight of the ship is dis-
tributed over much greater area and it does away with
a tremendous amount of head resistance these rollers
have been nearly completely countersunk and wheels
cannot be

  here is the main engine room that engine there
develops about  horsepower there are two
smaller engines one on each side out in the wings
these develop only about  apiece these are
the usual american type engine the arcot coal engine
patterned after the old diesel engine they were de-
veloped by arcot senior about fifty years ago and have
been little improved since though young arcot has
added a new type of vibration damper they burn
powdered coal by the compression ignition method
coal is powdered to an exceedingly fine dust and blown
into the cylinders where the up-stroke compresses the
air to about  pounds to the square inch the
fuel is burned with about thirty-nine percent efficiency
as compared to the old di-phenyl-oxide vapour turbines
which developed about ten per cent at best the fuel is
solid and easily handled and further there is no fire
risk

  the engines have sixteen cylinders of rather small
size for it was found that small cylinders with great
pressures and several in number gave higher efficiency
and less vibration than fewer large ones the big
mechanism up there reduces the speed of the engine
shaft to a speed that can be used on the props the
main prop is forty feet sweep the two others are each
thirty feet

  when the oil supplies gave out in - the
engineers were mighty hard pressed fuel they had in
the form of coal for many years the problem had
been staring them in the face and they had really
solved it of course there still remained the oil shales
but they could not be worked economically because of
the cost of extracting the oil it was cheaper to import
the lubricants they had to have these they tried to eke
out with copious amounts of graphite and re-refining
then about  some genius many claim the honor
got the very sensible idea that it was time they started
raising their own oil now as we fly over western
kansas you will see vast fields of green plants from
there clear across the country the green will continue

they are the gigantic plantations where our oil and
most of our fuel is grown the cornstalks are used as
fuel and a dozen other things by fermentation by par-
ticular bacterial ferments alcohol is the usual product
but many others can be obtained further west the
staple crop is castor oil beans that is the source of
our lubricating oil some man dug the secret out of
some century and a half-old book for in the days of
the development of the automobile it was found that the
petroleum was not good enough at that time to use in
the expensive racers and they used castor oil which did
not trouble them by dissolving the gasoline that big
tank up there is the main supply it is loaded with
synthetic graphite also for even that needs a little thin-
ning to go round our fields arent big enough yet the
castor oil bean plant is one of the necessities of this
country it supplies our oil and it helps supply our
alcohol of course wc do use hydrogenated coal to a
slight extent still but the main fuel is alcohol how
do you manage in england you do not have enough
area for castor oil production and not enough coal left

arcot and morey had not been prepared for this
but morey happened to be up oil those facts at
present from a recent trip to european cities

  why we arc using methyl alcohol as our fuel your
ethyl alcohol used commercially can be prepared by fer-
mentation with your great area but we have been forced
rather to extremes as you know we are now synthesiz-
ing the staple items of our food directly our coal t<x>
is nearly exhausted and we are beginning to wonder if
the old idea that englishmen had was so good you
know we used to sell our coal by the millions of tons to
ships every year now we need it badly we have been
forced to use our great deposits of limestone and other
carbonates as our source of carton the usual practice
is to electrolyse sea water for the chlorine and the sodium
as well as the hydrogen the ii and the cl are burned
together to give the acid this is used to treat limestone
to produce the col needed in industry the heat of the
reaction producing co by the direct decomposition of
the limestone the calcium chloride is now a very
important by-product while the cos thus obtained is
used to produce the necessary foods and fuels the
usual system is to treat it with hydrogen gas and produce
methyl alcohol this is then synthesized up to sugars
and other simple foods the power we use comes
directly from the sea by the process of using the differ-
ence in temperature of the sea water at great depths and
on the surface the power stations have been built all
along the coast now and great transmission lines reach
inland to supply the cities writh pow-er

  there are no chimneys in england today the
newest process looks as if it had great promise it is
simpler than the old methods and uses far less energy
they pass air through a liquid under great pressure and
in this way absorb the c content of the air the thing
becomes most interesting to look on in the whole the
energy comes from the sun it is used to stabilize carbo-
liydrogen compounds the carbon coming from the air as
co and the hydrogen from water the resultant foods
are used by the developers of the machine and we haw
at last gotten back to the model the plant offered millions
of years ago  this time with the sun as our source of
energy we dont have to worry about running out of
fuelv
piracy preferred



  in this country mr black wc have been forced to
use our coal very sparingly for all but absolutely essen-
tial industries we need it for metallurgical processes
what do you use

  that was one of our big problems we now find it
necessary to get most of our metals electrolytically the
power being generated as i state from the sea it is
cheap and our costs are not so much greater than yours
and our supply of power will last forever the only
trouble is that the metals are showing signs of exhaustion
as you know we now have to import practically all our
metals except iron but even that shows signs of giving-
out france is in a like condition her coal and iron are
nearly gone and even germany is feeling the stress pretty
badly russia and siberia with their vast area have
little to worry about they are still producing oil in
plentiful amounts their platinum alone seems to be
exhausted but the day will come i wonder what we
will do when there is no more high-grade iron ore 
lets not think about that it probably wont come
in our day

  probably not still there is the question

  while the men had been talking the great landing field
had been gradually dotted with people moving over
toward the great ship it would start now in about
twenty minutes the engineer suggested that they go
upstairs and watch things from the pilots room

  see the big tubes on top of the roof of the station
there those are the radio beacon generator tubes
they and others like them in san francisco will be
directing the ship as she flies along her route ten miles
up as iu the european lines we fly at about ten miles
thus avoiding any danger of mountains cutting down
air resistance and increasing the safety factor of landing
with the main engine alone going we can reach san
francisco from new york once we get altitude with
none of the engines going we can always glide to one
of the big cities for a safe landing so great is the area
of gliding range that there is  place on all earth
where we would not be within reach of a safe landing
there is no danger of the engines failing anyway so
we really dont have to worry should they have a
breakdown after the pilot and the crew have been gassed
the instruments will cut them out automatically lest they
wreck the ship and then it will make a safe automatic
landing at any nearby city by picking up the strongest
of the local guide beacons usually if there is any emer-
gency the pilot sits back and just lets the machines handle
it they never make a mistake as lorig as they are
working when they stop working the pilot takes charge
but they have never been known to stop working that
large case over there conceals a big battery of constantly
charged storage cells that operate the instruments we
do not take any chances on power failure

  see-they are getting ready to take-off they will
close the air doors soon i must go back to my office
but you can stay here and talk to the pilot-he wont
have anything to do anyway

  no i wont chief but that will be because the pilots
had sense enough to invent machines to make life easy
returned the pilot but -i will be glad to help you gen-
tlemen if i can there-hear that whir-now it has
almost gone they started the ventilator machinery
that will draw air in from outside and pump it up to
the necessary pressure for breathing in the ship no
matter what the external pressure is there is a much

bigger pump attached similarly to each of the engines
to supply it with the necessary oxygen you would think
that this would take a lot of the power from the engines
but any loss in pumping the air in is made up by the lower
back pressure on the exhaust now the engines are
starting-feel the momentary vibration-then it goes as
they get under way the props havent been thrown in
gear as yet the air-tight door is closed now the port-
able elevator is backing off going back toward the field
house i dont think it is particularly portable but
then one wouldnt say a tiling like this machine looked
very capable of flight while it is on the ground yet in
the low resistance air ten miles up we will make over
six hundred at times well its one now and the start-
ing signal is due i am afraid i must be excused now

  arcot and morey returned to their room convinced
that both pilot and engineer were intelligent and
courteous

  well now we have a nice long wait till we get to
san francisco and hack dick but you will have some-
thing to tell then

  i hope so bill and i hope that as soon as we get
there we can get ready to take the midnight plane from
san francisco which will get us in at nine oclock to-
morrow morning new york time i wish you would go
right to your fathers office and ask him over to our
place for supper and see if fuller can come too i
think we will be able to use that molecular controller on
this job it is almost finished and with it we will need
a good designing engineer then our little movie show
will  doubt be of interest

there was a low rumble that quickly mounted to a
staccato roar as the great propellers began whirling
and the engines took up the load the ground began to
flash behind them the giant plane was waddling awk-
wardly across the surface like a great duck then sud-
denly as flying speed was reached there was a slight
start the roaring bark of the engine took on a deeper
tone the rocking stopped and the ground was dropping
away like some mighty wild duck the plane was in
the air a graceful sentient thing wheeling in a great
circle as it headed back for san francisco for the wind
had been from the east when the ship took off now the
plane was climbing steadily in a long bank up up up
she went and gradually the terrific roar of the engine
died to a low throbbing hum as the low pressure of the
air silenced the noise a sound proof vacuum was around
them below them the giant city was contracting as the
great ship rode higher the tiny private helicops were
darting about below them like streams of nigh invisible
individuals creeping black lines among buildings of the
cities the towering buildings shone in the noon sun in
riotous hues as the colored tile facing reflected the bril-
liant sunlight with glowing warmth of color

  it was a city of indescribable beauty now it was one
of the things that made this trip so worth-while

  now the shining city was dropping behind them and
only the soft green of the jersey hills and the deep
purple-black of the sky above surrounded them the
sun was blazing high in the nigh-black heavens and the
rarefied air gave such slight diffusion effect that the
corona was readily visible with the aid of a smoked
glass around the sun long banners in space the zodi-
acal light gleamed dimly here and there some of the
brighter stars gleamed in the dark sky

stories

  below them the landscape was swinging slowly by
even to these men who had made the trip dozens of
times the sight was one to inspire and hold ones atten-
tion it was such a thing as had never been visible
before the development of these super-planes whole
flying observatories had been made that had taken photo-
graphs at heights of fiiteen miles where the air was so
rarefied that the plane had to travel close to eight hun-
dred miles an hour to stay up giant power was needed
to maintain this speed and only on rare occasions were
the machines taken so high bul the flexibility allowed
far better observation of solar eclipses than had ever
been possible for but once in a century would an eclipse
occur in the region of a large observatory

  already ahead of them arcot and morey could see
the great splotch of color that was chicago the mightiest
city of the earth situated as it was in die heart of the
north american continent with great water and ground
landing facilities and broad plains about it it made a
perfect air-port and the sea no longer meant much for
it was now only a source of power recreation and food
ships were no longer needed planes were faster and
the air resistance being so much less it was more econom-
ical also with its already great start toward ascendancy
chicago had rapidly forged ahead as the air lines devel-
oped with the great super-planes the euroean planes
docked here and it was the starting point oi the south
american lines but now as they swung high above
it the glistening walls of soft-colored tiles made it a
great mass of clumging flashing color beneath them as
they passed they could see a great airliner twice the
size of their plane taking off for japan its five giant
propellers visible only as flashing blurs as it climbed up
toward them then it was out oi sight

  it was over the green plains of nebraska that the
pirate worked so there the men became more and more
alert waiting for the first sign of abnormal sleepiness
the tenseness made them yawn and each immediately
wanted to start the camera lest they miss the raider
they soon realized however that it was only their
nervousness that made them yawn so they sat quietly
not talking listening intently for some new note but
knowing all the while that any sound the pirate might
make would be more than drowned out in the whirring
roar of the air sweeping past the giant airfoils of the
plane

  it was arcot who first began to feel sleepy and soon
he decided that it was not imagination he glanced
sleepily toward bill who was already lying down he
found it a tremendous effort of the will to make himself
reach up and close the switch that started the little
camera whirring almost noiselessly it seemed he never
pulled his arm back-he just-lay there-and-

  a white uniformed man was bending over him as he
opened his eyes to one side of him he saw morey
smiling down at him

  youre a fine guard arcot t thought you were
going to stay awake and watch them

  oh no i left a much more efficient watchman it
didnt go to sleep-i am willing to bet

  no il may not have gone to sleep but the doctor
here tells me it has gone somewhere else it wasnt
found in our room when we woke up i think the pirate
found it and confiscated it all our luggage including
the gas sample bottles is gone

  that is all right i arranged for that the ship

was brought down by an emergency pilot and fuller
had him fixed for me he took care of the luggage so
that no member of the pirates gang could steal it
there might have been some of them in the ground crew
they will be turned over to us as soon as we see the
emergency man i dont have to lie here any longer do
i doctor

  io dr arcot youre all right now i would suggest
that for the next hour or so you take it easy to let your
heart get used to beating again it stopped for some
two hours you know it is hard to change a habit of
some twenty-five or six years but once changed it is
hard to change back you will be all right though

  five men were sitting about the table discussing the
results oi the last raid in particular as related to arcot
and morey fuller and president morey as well as
dr arcot senior and the two young men were there
they had consistently refused to tell what their trip had
revealed saying that piclures would speak better than
they could so now the men adjourned to the library
where a small motion picture projector had been set up
as ther seated themselves in the darkened room arcot
set up the small screen then returned to the projector
and started it at once they were looking at the three
dimensional image of the rnail-room aboard the air liner

  i have cut out a lot of useless film and confincd the
picture to essentials we will now watch the pirate at
work

  even as he spoke they saw the door of the mail-room
open a bit and then to their intense surprise it remained
open for a few seconds then closed it went through all
the motions of opening lo admit someone yet no nna en-
tered i

  your demonstration doesnt seem to show much yet
son in fact it shows much less than i had expected
said the senior arcot but that door seems to open
easily i thought they locked them

  they did bnt the pirate just burned holes in it so to
save expense they dont anymore

now the scene seemed to swing a bit as the plane
hit an unusually bad air bump and through the
window they caught a glimpse of one of the circling air
guardsmen there suddenly appeared in the air a bit
of flame  hung in the air above the safe for an instant 
described a strangely complicated set of curves then as
it hung for an instant in mid-air it became a great flare
in an instant it narrowed down to a little point of bril-
liant red flame this described a complex series of
curves and touched the safe at the top in an inconceiv-
ably short time the eight-inch thickness of tungsto-iri-
dium alloy was glowing incandescent and running around
molten a large flare of the red flame sprang out to
surround the point of flame and this blew the molten
metal to one side a shower of brilliant sparks it was
cutting the metal rapidly now not burning it but blowing
it to one side perfectly fluid

  soon the torch had cut a large circular piece of metal
nearly free and it would soon drop into the safe now
the torch left the safe again retracting itself in that
uncanny manner no force seeming either to supply it
with fuel or to support it thus yet it burned steadily and
worked rapidly and efficiently no in mid-air it hung
for a second

  im going to work the projector for a few moments
by hand so that you may see this next bit of film
piracy preferred



arcot moved a small switch and the machine blinked
giving a strange appearance to the seemingly solid images
that were thrown on the screen

  the pictures seemed to show the flame slowly descend-
ing till it touched the metal again again the metal
glowed then as suddenly as the extinguishing of a light
the safe was gone it had disappeared into thin air
only the incandescence of the metal and the flame were
visible

  it seenis the pirate has solved the secret of invisi-
bility no wonder the air guardsmen couldnt and
him  exclaimed arcot senior

  the projector had been stopped exactly on the first
frame showing the invisibility of the safe then arcot
backed it up

  i think you are right dad he said but notice this
next frame

  now there appeared a picture of the room again the
window beyond the mail clerk asleep at his desk every-
thing as before except that in the place of the safe
there was a shadowy half visible safe the metal
glowing brightly and beside it there was visible a
shadowy man holding the safe with a shadowy bar of
some sort and through both of them the frame of the
window was perfectly visible and ironically an air
guardsman

  it seems that for an instant his invisibility failed
here probably it was the contact with the safe that
caused it what do you think dad  asked arcot junior

  it docs seem reasonable i cant see off-hand how
his invisibility is even theoretically possible have you
any ideas 

  well dad i have but i want to wait till tomorrow
night to demonstrate them lets adjourn this meeting
if you can all come tomorrow

  the next evening however it seemed that it was
arcot himself who could not be there he had asked
morey junior to tell them he would be there later when
he had finished in the lab

  dinner was over now and the men were waiting
rather impatiently for arcot to come they heard some
noise in the corridor and looked up but no one came

  morey asked fuller what did you learn about
that gas the pirate was using i remember arcot said
he would have some samples to analyze

  as to the gas dick found out but little more than
we had already known tt is a typical organic com-
pound one of the metal radical type and contains one
atom of thorium this is a bit radioactive as you know
and dick thinks that this may account in part for its
ability to suspend animation thorium has a valence
of four as have many o the semi-organic metal radicals
it is thus able to replace carbon in some structures
however since it was impossible to determine the mole-
cular weight he could not say what the gas was save
that the empirical formula was caath h rn- you
can see it is a very complex molecule it broke down at a
temperature of only  centigrade the gases left
consisted largely of methane nitrogen and methyl ether
dick is still in the dark as to what the gas is look
over there

  the men turned with one accord toward the opposite
end of the room looked and seeing nothing particularly
unusual glanced back rather puzzled what they then
saw or better failed to see puzzled them still more
there was no doubt morev could not be seen

  why-why where-ohhhli quick work dick
the senior arcot was laughing heartily and as the aston-
ished and curious pair looked toward him he stopped
and called out come on dick we want to see you
now and tell us how it is done  rather think mr
morey here-t mean the visible one-is still a bit
puzzled there was a short laugh from the air-cer-
tainly there could be nothing else there-then a low but
distinct click and both morey and arcot were miracu-
lously present coming instantaneously from nowhere if
ones senses could be relied on on arcots back there
was strapped a large and rather hastily wired mechanism
-one long wire running from it and out into the labora-
tory he was carrying a second piece of apparatus
similarly wired morey was touching a short metal bar
that arcot held extended in his hand using a table knife
as a connector lest they get radio frequency burns on
making contact

  i have been very busy getting the last connection of
this portable apparatus rigged up i have the thing in
working order as you see-or rather didnt see this
other outfit here is the tiling that is more important to
us it is a bit heavy so if you will dear a space i will
set it down look out for my power supply there-that
wire is carrying a rather dangerously high emf i
had to connect with the lab power supply to do this
as i had no time to rig up the beautiful little mechanism
the pirate must have

  i have duplicated his experiment he has simply
made use of a principle known tor some time but as
there was no need for it they havent used it it was
found back in the early days of radio as early as the
first quarter of the twentieth century that very short
wavelengths effected peculiar changes in metals it was
shown that the plates of tubes working on very short
waves became nearly transparent the waves were so
short however that they were economically useless
they would not travel in usable paths so they were
never developed furthermore the apparatus developed
could not be made to handle them in the last war they
tried to apply the idea for making airplanes invisible
but they could not get their tubes to handle the power
needed so they had to drop it however with the tube
i recently got out on the market it is possible to get
down there i think our friend the pirate has developed
this thing to a point where he could use it you can see
that invisibility while interesting and a good thing for a
stage and vaudeville is not very much of a commercial
need no one wants to be invisible in any honest occu-
pation invisibility is a tremendous weapon in war so
the pirate just started a little private war the only way
he could make any money on his invention no one
wants it people cant use an invisible plane-they would
run too much risk of being crashed if two oi the blamed
things were in the neighborhood it could never be known
when one might run into the other

  his gas too made the tiling attractive he had
probably discovered that before

tphe whole thing looks to me to be the work of a

  a madman he is not violently insane probably just
has one particular obsession his scientific bump cer-
tainly shows no sign of weakness he might even be
some new type of kleptomaniac he steals things and
lie has already stolen far more than any man could ever
have any need of and he leaves in its place a stock


amazing stories

certificate in bis own company he is not violent for
hasnt he carefully warned tlie men not to use the c-l
mask 

   and his careful instructions as to how to revive the
people he is insane in one branch only but he has
developed this machine for invisibility and naturally he
can fly in and out of the air guard and they will never
know hes there provided their microphonic detectors
dont locate him but they have a mighty poor chance

i believe that he uses some form of glider he cannot
use an internal combustion engine for the light of the
explosions in the cylinders would be as visible as though
the cylinders were made of clear fused quartz he
cannot have an electric motor for the storage of his
energy would be a weighty matter-the cells would
necessarily weigh too much furthermore if he were
using any sort of prop the noise of the air around it
would give him away if he used a glider the noise of
the great ship so near would be more than enough to kill
the slight sounds the glider could hang above the ship
then dive down iqion it as it passed beneath he has a
very simple system of anchoring the tiling as i dis-
covered to my sorrow he has a powerful electro-magnet
and just turns that on when he lands the landing deck
of the big plane was right above our office aboard and i
found my watch was doing all sorts of antics today it
lost an hour this morning and this afternoon it gained
two i found out it was very highly magnetized-i could
pick up needles with tlie balance wheel i demagnetized
it now it runs all right i noticed you do the same thing
to yours later bill

   i had to it took me twenty-five minutes to walk two
blocks according to my watch the next two blocks i
did in a minute and forty-five seconds

   but to get back he anchors his ship then leaving it
invisible he goes to the air lock and enters he wears a
high altitude suit and on his back he has a portable
invisibility set and tlie fuel for his torch the gas has
already put everyone to sleep sp he goes into the ship
still invisible and melts open the safe

  his power supply for the invisibility machine seems
to be somewhat of a problem but i think i would use a
cylinder of liquid iir and have a small air turbine to run
a high voltage generator lie probably uses the same
system on a larger scale to run his big machine on the
ship he cant use an engine for that either

  thai torch of his is interesting too we have had
atomic hydrogen welding for some time and atomic
hydrogen releases some  calories per mole of
molecular hydrogen two grams of gas give one hundred
thousand calories oxygen has not been prepared in
any commercial quantity in the atomic state from
watching that mans torch from the color of the flame
and other indications i gather that he uses a flame of
atomic oxygen-atomic hydrogen for melting and sur-
rounds it with a preheating jacket of atomic hydrogen
since oxygen lias two valenccs instead of one its heat
of formation is greater the center flame probably de-
velops a temperature of some  centigrade and will
naturally make that tungsten alloy run like water but
there has never been any commercial way of storing
atomic hydrogen it has always required a big electrical
power supply and expensive apparatus since this fel-
low was able to use it as a portable welding and cutting
tool he has a means of storing it i rather believe he
dissolves it in some substance remember the difficulties

they had in storing acetylene they could not store it
in the liquid state as it would often explode they finally
solved the problem by dissolving it in acetone i think
that the pirate has found some liquid that will store his
atomic hydrogen under slight pressure that is tlie
only way he could produce the results he has now as
to this machine here

   it is as i said a machine which impresses very high
frequencies on the body it is connected with this puls
the molecules in vibration at a frequency approaching
that of light and when the light impinges upon it it
can pass through readily you know that metals transmit
light for short distances but in order that the light pass
the molecules of metal must be set in harmonic vibration
at a rate approaching the frequency of light if we can
impress such a vibration on a piece of matter it will then
transmit light very freely if we impress this vibration
on the matter say the body electrically we get the
same effect and the body becomes perfectly transparent
now since it is the vibration of the molecules that makes
the light pass through the material it must be stopped if
we wish to see the machine obviously it is much easier
to detect me here among solid surroundings than in the
plane high in the sky what chance has one to detect a
machine that is perfectly transparent when there is noth-
ing but perfectly transparent air around it it is a
curious property of this vibrational system of invisibility
that the index of refraction is made very low it is not
the same as that of air but the difference is so slight that
it is practically within the limits of observation error so
small is the difference that there is no rainbow effect
the difference of temperature of the air would give
equal effect

   now since this vibration is induced by radio impulse
is it not possible to impress another opposing radio
impulse that will overcome this tendency and bring the
invisible object into the field of the visible once more
it is and this machine on the table is designed to do
exactly that it is practically a beam radio set projecting
a beam of wavelength  meter a wavelength that alone
would tend to produce invisibility but in this case it
will make me visible i am going to stand right here
and bill can operate that set

  arcot strode to the middle of the room and then
morey turned the reflector of tlie beam set on him there
was a low snap as arcot turned on his set then he was
gone as suddenly as the coming of darkness when a lamp
is extinguished he was there one moment then they
were staring at the chair behind him knowing that the
man was standing between them and it knowing that
they were looking through his body it gave one a
strange feeling an uncomfortable tingling along the
spine then the voice-it seemed to come from the air
or some disembodied ghost as the invisible man called
to morey

   all right bill turn her on slowly

there was another snap as the switch of the dis-
rupter beam was turned on at once there was a
noticeable fogginess in the air where arcot had been
as more and more power was turned into the machine
they saw the man materialize out of thin air first he
was a mere shadowy outline that was never fully above
the level of conscious vision then slowly the outlines
of the objects behind became dimmer and dimmer as
the body of the man was slowly darkened till at last
piracy preferred



 there was only a wavering aura about him with
 a snap morey shut off his machine and arcot
 was gone again a second snap and he was
 solid before them he had shut off his
 apparatus loo

   you can see now how we intend
 to locatc our invisible pirate of
 course we will depend on direc-
 tional radio disturbance lo-
 cating devices to deter-
 mine the direction for
 the invisibility dis-
 rupter ray rut you
 are probably
 marvelling at
 the great-
 ness of

the apparatus i am working on it is very im-
portant that you be here fuller i am going to
need you in the work to follow it will be
another problem in design if this works
out as i hope it will

            ill certainly make every effort to
            be here arcot fuller assured
            him i can promise you a tough
            problem as well as an inter-
            esting one if the thing
            works as i expect it to
            you will have a job
            that will certainly
            be a feather for
            your cap also
            it will be a
            change

the genius
who can de-
sign and con-
struct this ap-
paratus all in one
clay i will explain
the miracle-i have
been working on short
wave phenomenon for some
time in fact i had actually
made an invisibility machine as
morey will testify but i realized
that it had no commercial benefits so
i did not experiment with it beyond the
laboratory stunt stage i am still working
on a somewhat different piece of apparatus
that i believe we will find very relevant to this
business i will ask you to adjourn after tonights
meeting for another twenty-four hours till i can finish

as more and more
power was turned
into the machine they
saw the man mate-
rialize out of thin air


amazing stories

  well with that inducement spoken by you i will
certainly be here but i think that pirate could give us
some hints on design how does he get his glider ten
miles up they have done some gliding already the
distance record took someone across the atlantic in 
didnt it i know they have about stopped but it does
seem that ten miles straight up is a bit too steep for a
glider there are no vertical air currents at that height
i meant to say that his machine is not a true glider
but a semi-glider he probably goes up ten miles or
more with the aid of a small engine one so small it
takes him all morning to get there probably it is very
seldom anyone goes that high o  course there are some
who are trying the ceiling of their new machines but
they are mighty few-it is too long drawn out a proce-
dure it wouldnt pay for the big transcontinental
planes to go that high just the sheer power and work
done getting there would he prohibitive if they couldnt
use it all on the last part of the flight by gliding you
know that better than i do and it would be easy for
a plane to pass through the lower traffic lanes then being
invisible mount high and wait for the air liner he
cant use a very large engine for it would drag him
down but a hundred horsepower or so would weigh only
about so pounds if one of the new tungsto-iridium blade
turbine engines is used i think we can draw a pretty
good picture of his plane from scientific logic it prob-
ably has a tremendous wingspread and a very high angle
of incidence to make it possible to glide at that height
and the engine and prop will be almost laughably small
the next evening the meeting was resumed and there
was considerable questioning as to the nature of the
discovery that arcot was going to announce for even
his father did not know the two men worked in sepa-
rate laboratories except when either had a particularly
difficult problem that might be solved by the other all
knew that the new development lay in the field of short
wave research of some sort but they could not find out
in what way it concerned the problem in hand

  at last the meal was over and arcot was ready to
demonstrate

  dad i believe that you have been trying to develop
a successful solar engine one that could be placed in
the wings of a plane to generate power from the light
falling on that surface in all solar engines what is the
greatest problem to lie solved

  well the more i investigate the thing the more i
wonder which is the greatest there are a surprising
number of annoying problems to be met i should say
though that the one big trouble with all solar engines
eliminating the obvious restriction that they decidedly
arent dependable for night work is the difficulty of
getting an area to absorb the energy if i could get
enough area i could use a very low efficiency and still
have cheap power for the power is absolutely free the
area problem is the greatest difficulty no doubt

  well i think you have a fair good area to use if
you can only harness the energy it absorbs i have really
developed a very efficient solar engine the engine itself
requires no absorbing area as i want to use it it takes
advantage of the fact that the earth is absorbing quintil-
lions of horse-power i have merely lapped the power
that the earth has already absorbed for me come here
he led the way down the corridor to his laboratory
and switched on the lights on the main laboratory bench
was set up a complicated apparatus of many tubes and

heavy bus bar connecters from the final tube two thin
wires ran to a long tubular coil to the left of this coil
was a large relay switch and a rheostat control

  turn on the relay dad then slowly rotate the con-
troller to the left and remember that it is rather
powerful i know this doesnt look like a solar engine
and nine oclock at night seems a peculiar hour to demon-
strate such a thing but i will guarantee you results-
and probably more than you expect

  dr arcot stepped up to the controls and closed the
switch the lights dimmed a bit but immediately bright-
ened again and from the other end of the room came a
low steady hum as the big transformer took up the load

  well from the sound of that ten kw transformer
there if this engine is very efficient we ought to get a
terrific amount of power out of it dr arcot was smil-
ing amusedly at his son i cant very well control this
except by standing directly in front of it but i suppose
you know what youre doing

  oh this is a laboratory model and i havent gotten
the thing into shape really look at the conductors that
lead to the coil they certainly arent carrying ten kw

tyr arcot slowly rotated the rheostat there was
 a slight hum from the coil then it was gone there
seemed to be no result he rotated it a bit more there
was a slight draught in the room apparently but he could
see no startling results so he rotated the rheostat con-
siderably more this time there was absolutely no doubt
as to the results there was a roar like a fifty-foot wind
tunnel and a mighty blast of cold air swept out of that
coil like a six-inch model of a kansas cyclone every
loose piece of paper in the laboratory was driving madly
before the blast of air lhat had suddenly leapt out dr
arcot was forced back as by a giant hand but in reeling
back his hand was lifted from the relay switch and
with a thud it had opened the circuit in an instant all
the noise was gone and only a slight drifting of the air
in the room told of the blast that had stirred it up so

  the astonished physicist came forward and looked at
it a moment in silence while each of the other men
watched him finally he turned to his son who was
smiling at him wilh a bit of a twinkle in his eye

  dick i think you have loaded the dice in a way
that is even more lucrative than any other method ever
invented if the principle of this machine is what i
think it is you have certainly solved the secrct of a
sufficiently absorbing area for a solar engine

  well remarked the elder morey shivering a bit
in the chill air of the room loaded dice have long been
noted for their ability to make money but i dont see
how that explains that working model of an arctic
tornado brrr-it is still too cold in here i think
he will need considerable area for heat absorption from
the sun for that engine certainly does cool things down
what is the secret

  the principle is easy enough but i had considerable
difficulty with the application i think it is going to be
rather important though-

  rather important broke in the inventors father i
should think it will be considerably more than that it
is the biggest thing since the electric dynamo tt puts
airplanes in the junk heap it means a new era in power
generation it makes it certain that we will never have
to worry about power it will make interplanetary
travel not only possible but commercially economical
piracy preferred



  dad seems to think it is a marvelous machine but
seriously i believe it will antiquate all types of airplanes
it is a direct utilization of the energy that the sun is
kindly supplying for a good many years now men have
been trying to find out how to release the energy of
atoms or more powerful yet the energy of constitution
of matter it always reminded me of experimenting with
fire on a pile of gunpowder of course you could stand
there holding the match quite safely but if someone
burned his fingers and dropped the match-

  but why do it at all the sun is doing it already
and on a scale so gargantuan that we could never hope
nor desire to approach it three million tons of matter
go into that colossal furnace every second of time and
out of that comes two and a half deeilion ergs of energy
with a total of two and a half million billion billion bil-
lions of ergs to draw on man will have nothing to worry
altout for a good many years to come that represents
a flood of power vaster than man could comprehend it
would fuse the earth so quickly you wouldnt have a
chance to worry about the hot weather why try to
release any more energy we have all that to use we
may as well tap that vast ocean of power

  we have been doing that to an extent plants have
done it for countless ages and more recently man has
imitated by absorbing the power from the oceans heat
but i would hate to estimate their efficiency the solar
engines developed so far are more efficient of course
they run as high as thirty per cent but as dad says
they are tremendously bulky only dirigibles can use
them and then they are effective only during the day
dad has told you we need a larger heat absorbing area
and also if it is going to work during the night we must
have some means oi storing the heat energy to use after
sunset now i think the earth would make a very nice
storage basin it certainly has a very comfortable area
and furthermore it has a nice thick blanket of air and
water that hold a tremendous amount of heat for night
use but it has always been a little hard to use that
energy as we wish though it is all there-more than we
can use but just try and get that energy out just
think of the terrific amount of power there is stored in
the millions of tons of water on the earth there is only
one thing that prevents us getting it out the law of prob-
ability thats why dad mentioned loaded dice for dice
as you know are the classical example of probability
when they arent loaded once they are loaded the law
still holds but the conditions arc now so changed that it
will make the problem quite different still the law
holds ill admit that dice always seem to show the
wrong facc but with a very great number of trials each
face will show an equal number of times the more
trials you make the more nearly does this approach to
exactitude similarly there are many other illustrations
of the law of probability if you take an infinite number
of chances it always works out but if you take any
finite number of chances it wont

  the ideal case of an infinite number of chances is
very nearly approached in one instance

  molecules in matter which has any heat at all are
moving rapidly colliding rebounding and moving off
there are immense numbers of molecules in the tiniest
grain of dust your eye can see when you consider
the conditions in a liter of helium gas in a container you
can consider that there are an infinite number of mole-

   ocd   deeilion

cules in it to all practical purposes in it then there
is an equal chance for any molecule to go in any one
direction and the chances are that there is an equal
number of molecules going in each direction thus we
have our helium gas composed of a tremendous number
of molecules each dashing along at several miles a
second and an equal number dashing in the opposite
direction at an equal speed they are so thickly packed
in there that none of them can go very far before it runs
into another molecule and bounces off in a new direction
but there is a chance that all the molecules should
happen to move in the same direction at the same time
how good is this chance one of the old physicists of
einsteins time a man named eddington expressed it
very well when he said

   if an army of monkeys were playing on
 typewriters they might write all the books in
 the british museum the chance of their
 doing so is decidedly more favorable than the
 chance that all the molecules in a liter of gas
 should move in the same direction at the same
 time

the very improbability of this chance is the thing that is
making our problem appear impossible

  but similarly it would be improbable-impossible ac-
cording to the law of chance-to throw a string of aces
indefinitely or lhat one should deal a deck of cards and
always deal thirteen of a kind in each hand it is impos-
sible-unless some other force influences the happening

i	f the dice have bits of iridium stuck under the six spots
they will throw aces if the cards are stacked they
will always deal thirteen of a kind chance makes it
impossible to have all the molecules of gas move in the
same direction at the same time-unless we stack the
chances if we can find some way to influence them
they may do so

  what -would happen to a metal bar if all the molecules
in it decided to move in the same direction at the same
time their heat motion is normally carrying them
about at a rate of several miles a second and if now we
have them all go one way the entire bar must move in
that direction and it will start off at a velocity as great
as the velocity of the individual molecules but now if
we attach the bar to a heavy car it will try to start off
but will be forced to drag the car with it and so will
not be able to have its molecules moving at the same
rate they will be slowed down in starting the mass of
the car but slow molecules have a definite physical
significance molecules move because of temperature and
lack of motion means lack of heat these molecules
that have been slowed down are then cold they will
absorb heat from the air about them and since the mole-
cule of hydrogen gas at room temperature is moving at
about seven miles a second when the molecules of the
confined gas in our car or the molecules of the metal bar
are slowed down to but a few hundred miles an hour
their temperature drops to some hundreds of degrees
below zero and they absorb energy very rapidly for the
greater the difference in temperature the greater the
rate of heat absorption of course in running our ma-
chine we must exercise caution for the bar will try to
start off at the ful speed instantly and fastened or not
that is the speed it will go unless its power is applied
gradually

in practice i think it will be best to use helium in a


amazing stories

copper container since helium has a very low freezing
point and having a very light molecule it goes at very
high speeds when at room temperature- the copper will
carry the heat to it better than any other metal aud
that will permit the use of absorbing fins

   we will be able to accelerate the car very rapidly to
a speed of several miles a second at very high aliitudes
no doubt and as we will be able to use a perfectly en-
closed streamlined car we will be able to get tremendous
speeds we will need no wings of course for by just
putting a small unit pointed vertically we will be able
to support the car in the air it will make possible a
machine that will be able to fly in reverse and so come
to a quick stop it will steer us or it will supply us with
electrical power for we merely have to put a series of
small metal bars about the circumference of the genera-
tor and get a tremendously powerful engine for
ground cars where speeds of over one hundred and fifty
miles an hour are impractical we will use a metal bar
as that is so much more directable and less subject to
gas leaks and failures though there will be little chance
of either in a welded inch-thick copper power unit

  but for our present need it means a tremendously
powerful engine that we can make invisible

   i believe you can guess the source of that breeze we
had there it would make a great device for cooling
and ventilating theaters and apartments

  bill arcot began morey i would like to be able
to use that invention i know enough of the economics
of the thing if not enough of the science to know that
the apparatus before us is absolutely invaluable i could
not offer to buy the rights on it but i want to use it if
you will let me it means a new thing in transcontinental
airliners fuller i want you to help arcot with his
problem for the ship to chase the pirate i will give
you the contract to design the new airliners it will cost
us billions to get those new machines out but there will
be no fuel bills no oil bills and the cost of operation
will be negligible nothing but the arcot short wave
tubes to buy-and each one is good for twenty-five
thousand hours service i

  you will get the rights on this if you want them
naturally said arcot you are maintaining these lal-
oratories for me and your son here helped me work it
out but if fuller can move over here tomorrow it
will help things a lot also t would like to have some
of your best special mechanics to make the necessary
machines and to start the power units

  bill replied morey you know that these labs are
yours and anytliing developed in them is yours and tliat
dick is officially one of your employes i will have the
men here tomorrow do you want to keep this invention
secret 

  why i only did some mathematics but i do think
it would he best to keep it a secret because if the pirate
hears about it he may get cautious and quit his work
dick pointed out

   i hadnt particularly intended to keep it a secret but

i	guess you are right dick

early the next moruing fuller moved his materials
over to the laboratory and set up his table for
work then with the aid of arcot and morey the
design of the new machine was begun

   first lets get some idea of the most advisable shape
fuller said we will want a streamlined shape roughly

   speaking a cylindrical shape modified to fit the special
uses to which it will be put you  doubt have more
of the general plan in mind arcot suppose you sketch
it for us

  well i thought it would be best to design it also as
an experimental ship we dont know much about this
yet and we have to work it out you will have plenty of
fun figuring out strains in this machine so lets be safe
and use a factor of safety of  that will also give us
a heavier machine to do the testing with

   iii the first place it must be proof against the pirates
gas for we wont be following the regular lanes with
instruments to guide us safely if we go out i have
thought that over and i think that the best system is
just what we used in the sample bottles-a vacuum his
gas is stopped by nothing so to speak but there is no
substance that will stop it it will no doubt penetrate
the outer shell hut on reaching the vacuum it will tend
to stay there between the inner and outer walls here
it will tend to collect since it will be fighting air pres-
sure in its attempts to go either in or out the pressure
inside will force it back and the pressure outside will
force it in if we did not pump it out it would soon
build up pressure enough to penetrate the interior wall
now since the stuff can leak through any material what
kind of a pump shall we use it wont be pushed by a
piston for it will leak through either the cylinder walls
or the piston a centrifugal pump would be equally in-
effective the obvious solution is a mercury vapor pump
which will of course take it out and keep a high
vacuum the difficulty leing that that land of a pump has
too low a volume of rating we never would make any
progress the thing would be impossible but for our
new machine with it we can just have a number of
openings in the wall of the outer shell and set in them
one of these molecular motion directors and direct the
molccules out they cant come in through it and they
will tend to go out that will protect us from the
pirates gas

  but now comes another difficulty if we protect our-
selves against the pirates gas by a vacuum we must
remember that our vacuum is an equally good protection
against heat  since our generator is intended to run
on heat energy it will lie rather chilly inside if we dont
remedy that of course our power units will he placed
outside where the blast of air will wrarm them but we
really wont have a very good streamline effect if we
hang a big electric generator outside the solution is
obvious-if we cant bring the generator to the air we
must bring the air to it we will have all the power
equipment in this room here in the back and the control
room up in front here the relays for controlling will
be back here so we can control electrically the operation
of the power equipment from our warm gas-tight room
if it gets too warm in there wc can cool it by using a
little of the heat to help accelerate the ship if it is
too cold we can turn on an electric heater run by the
generator the air for the generator can come in through
a small sort of scoop on top and leave through a small
opening in the rear the vacuum at the tail will assure
us a very rapid circulation even if the centrifugal pump
action of the enclosed generator isnt enough

  for experimental purposes we will want the generator
to be greatly over power so that we can make tests over
a greater range i donl believe we will need more than
one hundred kilowatts altogether but we should install
piracy preferred



about a thousand for convenience-ac of course so
vve can send it through transformers we will need
batteries in the keel for starting the generator once the
speed is high enough it will be self-supporting but it
can have a small auxiliary dc machine to recharge the
batteries and to run the relays about ten kilowatts will
do there

  but lets begin making actual figures on this

  for the rest of the day the three men were working
on the general plan of the new ship trying to calculate
the strengths needed supplementing mathematics with
actual experiments with the machines  hand it was
decided to put the batteries inside the main control room
lest they freeze at extreme altitudes

  it would be two days before they had finished the
calculating machines were busy continuously for here
there were few rules that experience could give them
they were developing something entirely new and
though they had as a designing staff three of the fore-
most mathematicians in the world it was a problem that
tested them to the utmost

  by the evening of the first day however they had been
able to give the finished designs for the power units to
the mechanics who were to make them the order for
the storage battery and the standard electrical equipment
load been placed at once by the time they had com-
pleted the drawings for the main castings the materials
were already being assembled in a little private camp that
morey owned up in die hills of vermont the giant
freight helicopters could land readily in tlie wide field
that had been cleared on the small plateau in the center
of which nestled a little blue lake and a winding trout
brook

  the mechanics and electrical engineers had been sent
up there already-officially  vacation the entire pro-
gram could be carried out without attracting the least
attention for sudi orders from the great transconti-
nental lines were so frequent that no importance was
attached to them

  four days after the final plans had been completed
the last of tlie supplies were being assembled in the
portable metal shed that was to house tlie completed
machine the shining tungsto-steel alloy frame members
were rapidly being welded in place by tlie cathode ray
welding torches in the hands of skilled artisans

  already at tlie other end of the shop the generator
had been arranged for use wsith the molecular motion
power units the many power units to drive and sup-
port the ship were -finished and waiting instalment as
the party quit work on that fourth evening they would
bo installed on the frame in the morning and the genera-
tor would be hoisted into place with the small portable
crane the storage batteries were connected up and
in place in the hull the great fused quartz windows
were resting in their cases on one side of the room
waiting the complete application of tlie steel alloy plates
they were to be over an inch thick an unnecessary
thickness perhaps but they had no need to economize
weight as witnessed by their choice of steel instead of
light metal alloys throughout the construction

  the three men had arrived late that afternoon in a
small helicopter and had gone directly to the shops to
see what progress had been made they had been
forced to remain in new york to superintend the ship-
ment of the necessary supplies to the camp site and since
no trouble was anticipated in the making of the steel

framework they had not felt it necessary to come but
now they would be able to help and to superintend the
more delicate work

  she is shaping up nicely isnt she arcot was gaz-
ing at the rapidly rounding frame with a critical eye
unhindered as they were by the traditional shapes by
wings or other protuberances they had been able to
design a machine of striking beauty the ship was to-
be left in the natural shiny metal the only protection
being a coat of tlie newly discovered passivity paint-
a liquid chemical that could be brushed or sprayed on
iron chromium nickel or cobalt alloys rendering them
passive to practically all chemical agents iron can be
rendered passive by treating in very concentrated nitric
acid the result being a piece of iron that is unattacked
by nitric acid sulphuric or even aqua regia which will
dissolve gold and platinum and to a certain extent
iridium this new paint produced a much more per-
manent passivity in iron leaving the iron or steel as
shiny as ever but overcast with a beautiful iridescence
and immune to tlie most powerful reagents

the three men miked around the rapidly growing
hull and looked with excited interest at the heavy
welded joints and the great beams the ship seemed
capable of withstanding a fall of several hundred feet
with litde damage the location of the power units was
plainly visible and easily recognized for at each point
there came together four or five great beams welded
into one great mass of tough metal and in it there were
set the heavy tungsten bolts that would hold tlie units
in place stronger than steel tungsten had a great ad-
vantage here for its long fibrous structure made it
peculiarly resistant to shearing strains

  they inspected each joint minutely for signs of flaws
using a small portable x-ray fluoroscope to see the inte-
rior of the metal each joint seemed perfect they
retired satisfied everything was ready for the work of
the next day

  the morning began early with a long swim in the lake
and a hearty breakfast of country farm produce a thing
rare to diese city-bred men then the work on the
great framework was continued and that day saw the
power units bolted in place removable if change was
thought advisable each power unit was equipped with
long streamlined copper fins lying close to tlie rounded
hull that they might absorb heat more rapidly

  day by day the structure neared completion and with
the large crew of specially skilled workers the machine
was practically complete within a week only the instru-
ments remained to be installed then at last even these
had been put hi place and with the aid of fuller morey
junior and his own father arcot had connected their
many complicated circuits

  son remarked arcots father looking critically at
the great switchboard with its maze of connections its
many rheostats and controls and its heavy busbar con-
nectors behind it any man who can keep his eye on
those instruments must be a close relative of the insects
with their many-faceted eyes i certainly hope you have
a good-sized crew to operate all those controls we have
spent two days of hard work getting all those circuits
together and ill admit that some of them still have me
beat i dont see how you intend to watch all those
instruments and at the same time have any idea whats
going on outside


amazing stories

   oh laughed arcot junior these arent intended
 for constant watching they are merely to aid in effi-
ciency tests and tests of different kinds i will set the
controls for ordinary work but first i will have to
experiment to determine at what values they will work
best i want to experiment with this machine so i can
determine the neccssary powers and the lowest factor of
safety to use in building other machines i want to use
this as a flying laboratory for the necessary experiments
the machine is very nearly completed now all we
need is the seats-they are to be special air-inflated gyro-
scopically controlled seats to make it impossible for a
sudden twist of the ship to put the strain in the wrong
direction of course the main gyroscopes will balance
the ship laterally horizontally and vertically hut each
chair will have a separate gyroscopic mounting for safety
i want you to remember that this is an experimental
model and not the finished ship no machine in all the
history of invention was truly perfected by any one
man i have had the thoughts of four men helping me
on this and the practical suggestions nf experienced
mechanics the ideas of old workers and i believe that
the machine will function perfectly but i want to be
able to watch the working of every smallest piece of the
structure

   i willpractice the manipulation of the machine for
at least four days before i try to chase the pirate i
would ordinarily rccommend the greatest haste but the
man has stolen close to ten millions now and is still at it
that would not be done by anyone in his right mind
just think the war department thought that gas so
important that they have obtained a pardon for him on
condition they be permitted to have the secret of it
they demand the return of the money and i have no
doubt he has it i am firmly convinced that he is a
kleptomaniac i doubt greatly if he will stop taking
money before he is caught therefore it will be safe
to wait until we can be sure of our ability to operate the
machine smoothly to start out without practice when
we are operating such a tremendously powerful airship
would be suicidal also i am having some of those
tool-makers make up a special type of molecular motion
machine for use as ft machine gun the bullets are steel
about three inches long and as thick as my thumb they
will be perfectly streamlined except for a little stabilizer
at the tail to act as a guider they will not spin as a
rifle bullet does ahd so there will be no gyroscopic effect
to hold them nose on but the streamlining and the
stabilizer will keep them on their course  expect than
to be able to walk right through many inches of armour
plate since they will have a velocity of over four miles
a second

   they will be fed in at the rate of about two hundred
a minute-faster if i wish and started by a small spring
they will instantly come into the field of a powerful
molecular motion-director and will at once be shot out
with terrific speed it will be the first rifle ever made
that could shoot bullets absolutely parallel to the ground
the bullets would go on forever without hitting the earth
if  shot them when up above the air for they will follow
an orbit at five miles a second a thing is in equilibrium
between centrifugal force tending to throw it away from
the earth and gravity tending to pull it down as you
know it will be accurate at all ranges allowing for
wind-carriage only

   but that is all wc can do today the guns will be

mounted outside and controlled electrically and the
charts will be installed tomorrow by the day after
tomorrow at eight a m we ought to take off

  later that evening they strolled down for a last swim
for strong moonlight was flooding the vermont country-
side

  as they returned from the swim morey noticed that
arcot was standing off to one side looking up at the
moon

  thinking of visiting the moon dick i wonder if
you could

  i dont know bill-but-it isnt impossible now

  the work the next day was rushed to completion far
earlier than arcot had dared to hope all the men had
been kept isolated at the farm lest they accidentally
spread the news of the new machine it was with excited
interest that they helped the machine to completion the
guns had not been mounted as yet but that could wait
three-thirty of the afternoon found the machine resting
in the great construction shed completely equipped and
ready to fly

  dick said morey as he strode up to him after testing
the last of the gyroscopic seats shes ready to fly i
certainly want to get her going-it is only three-thirty
and we can go around to the sunlight part of the world
when it gets dark at the speeds we can travel lets
test her out now

  i have sent for a u s air inspector as soon as
he comcs we can start i will have to put an x license
indication on her now he will go with us to test it
there will be room for three other people aboard and
i think that you and dad and i will be the logical pas-
sengers look there is a government helicopter com-
ing i guess we will start soon tell the men to get the
blocks out from under it and tow it out on the rollers
get it at least ten feet beyond the end of the hangar
we will start it straight up and climb up to at least
five miles where we will have room to make mistakes
safely when we learn to operate this thing we want to
remember that the machine is infinitely more powerful
than anything either of us ever laid our hands on before
while you are tending to that i will see if t can induce
the air inspector to take a trip with us

  half an hour later the machine had been rolled entirely
out of the shed the great rollers sank deep into the
soft turf of the soil as the two-hundred-ton burden
pressed down on them

the great machine was a thing of beauty as it rested
-- in the bright sunlight for the firsi time the machine
was out of the dimness of the construction shed and its
true features and lines were apparent the four men
who were to ride in it on its maiden voyage were off
to one side looking at the great gleaming metal hull the
long sweeping lines of the sides told a story of perfect
streamline and implied high speed even when it rested
thus inert on the ground the bright slightly iridescent
steel hull shone in sifvery contrast to the gleaming
copper of the power units heat-absorption fins the
great clear windows in the nose and the low streamlined
air intake for the generator seemed only to accentuatc the
lines of the graceful machine

  lord shes beautiful isnt she dick exclaimed
morey looking at the glistening hull

  well she did shape up nicely on paper too didnt
she oh fuller come and look at your masterpiece
piracy preferred



it is even better looking than we thought now the copper
has added color to it doesnt she look fast i wish
we didnt need physicists so badly on this trip so you
could go on the first ride with us

  oh thats all right dick i know the number of
instruments in there and i realize they will mean a lot
of work this trip i wish you all luck the honor ol
having designed the first ship like that the first heavier
than air ship lhat ever flew without wings or helicopter
propellers-that is something to remember and i think
it is one of the most beautiful that ever flew too
well dick said his father lets get under way i
am anxious for the test

  the four men entered the ship and were strapped in
the gyroscopic seats one by one they reported ready

  officer i want lo explain that these scats may seem
to be a bit more active than one generally expects a seat
to be but in this experimental machine i have pro-
vided all the safety devices i could think oi the ship
itself wont fail of that i am sure but the power is so
great it might well prove fatal to us if we are not in a
position to resist the forces you know all too well the
effect of sharp turns at high speed and the results of
the centrifugal force this machine can develop such
tremendous power that i have lo make provision for it
you notice that my controls and the instruments are
mounted on the arm of the chair really that permits
me to maintain complete control of the ship at all limes
and still permits my chair to remain perpendicular to
the forccs the gyroscopes in the base here cause the
entire chair to remain stable if the ship rolls but the
chair can continue to revolve about this bearing here so
that we will not be forced out of our seats we will
always be sitting up and never lying down or leaning
back as we would seem to be if the chairs did not vary
in position with the forccs the air inflation makes
them more comfortable i sincerely hope you will find
the machine safe enough for a license i know the nec-
essary maneuvers required by law but i am not used
to handling this ship and i will have to take it straight
up first there is no one in the vicinity to be hurt by
any accidents so with your permission i will start
all right dr arcot if you and your father are
willing to try it i am replied the air inspector
ready engineer  asked arcot

  ready pilot replied morey

  all right-just keep your eye on the mete-s dad as
i turn on the system if the instruments back there
dont take care of everything and you see one flash over
the red mark-yank open the main circuit ill call out
what to watch as i turn them on

  t am ready son

  main gyroscopes i there was a low snap a clicking
of relays in the rear compartment and then a low hum
that quickly ran up the scale main generators again
the clicking switch and the relays thudding into action
again the rising hum seat-gyroscopes the low click
was succeeded by a quick scream that died in inaudibly
high frequency as the separate seat-gyroscopes took up
their work main power tule hank the low hum
of the generator behind changed to a momentary roar as
the relays threw the load on in a moment the automatic
controls had brought it up to speed

  everything is working perfectly so far arc wc
ready to start now son 

  main vertical power units i the great ship trembled

throughout its length as the lift of the power units began
to pull on it a special instrument had been rigged tem-
porarily on the floor beside arcot that he might be able
to judge the lift of his power units it registered the
apparent weight of the ship it had read two hundred
now all eyes were fixed on it as the pointer dropped
quickly to -------there was a
click and the instrument flipped back to -it was
registering in pounds now then the needle was at
zero and the mighty structure floated into the air slowly
moving down the field as a breeze carried it along the
ground now the men outside saw it rise swiftly into
the sky straight toward the blue vault of heaven in two
or three minutes it was disappearing the glistening
ship shrank to a tiny point of light then it was gone

it must have been rising at fully three hundred miles an
hour  the fastest racing helicopters seldom rose faster
than that the record was three hundred and thirty-
two miles an hour

  to the men in the car there had been a tremendous
increase in weight that had forced them into the air
cushions like leaden masses then the ground was-
dropping away with a speed that made them look in
amazement the house the construction shed the lake
all seemed contracting beneath them so quickly were
they rising that they had not had time to adjust their
mental attitude to them all the world seemed shrinking
about them now they were at a tremendous height
over twenty miles they had risen into the atmosphere the
air about them was so thin that the sky seemed black
the stars glazed out in cold unwinking glory while the
great fires oi the sun seemed reaching out into space
like mighty arms reaching-reaching to draw back to the
parent body the masses of the wheeling planets about
it in far flung streamers of cold fire the mighty zodiacal
light stretched out into space an aurora on a titanic
scale  for a moment they hung there while they made
readings of the meters

  i never legan to let out the power of this thing
when these are made commercially we will have to use
about ore horsepower generators in them or people will
try to see how fast it will go and will die of the terrific
acceleration and leave the car like some vast bullet
streaking on through the sky at ever greater speeds till
at last it throws itself off into space this would make
it a menace as well as a blessing i will have to be careful
myself

for several minutes the machine was tried out at this
height testing various settings of the instruments

tt was definitely proven that the values lhat arcot and
morey had assigned from purely theoretical calculations
were correct to within one-tenth of one per cent the
power absorbed by the machine they knew and had
calculated but the terrific power of the driving units
was far beyond their expectations they had estimated
the power of the machine as great bul even they had
been unable to calculate the power released

  well now were off for some horizontal maneuvers

i believe i have satisfactorily demonstrated the ma-
chines ability to hold itself in the air to climb at a safe
rate to a considerable altitude the air pressure controls
seem to be working perfectly i am now going to give
the necessary proof of ability to maintain traffic speed-

i believe they now require over two hundred miles an
hour i will accelerate it at the greatest safe value


amazing stories

  suddenly the seats swung beneath them a bit then
as the ship shot forward with ever greater speed ever
greater acceleration it seemed that it turned and headed
upward although they knew that the main stabilizing
gyroscopes were holding it level the seats swung
beneath them as the acceleration became greater and
greater in a moment the ship was headed out over the
atlantic at a speed no rifle bullet had ever known faster
and faster the plane streaked along until it became an
almost invisible blur the radio speedometer needle
pushed farther and farther over as the speed increased
to unheard of values before they left the north amer-
ican shoreline they were going over one mile a second
the speed increased terrifically as the men labored under
weights of seven to eight hundred pounds apiece they
were over the middle of the atlantic before arcot grad-
ually shut off the acceleration letting the seats drop back
into position once more they were able to judge up
and down with some definite standard

  they had been able to watch the sun sink rapidly
toward the horizon it was night on the water rolling
far beneath but the suns rays still reached them where
they were

  what speed did we reach dr arcot-look-there is
the coasl of europe watch it come toward us how
fast are we going asked die air inspector

  the air resistance is slowing us down we were
traveling at tlie rate of three miles a second before i
decreased the acceleration now it has fallen to two and
a half dr arcot answered

   that decidedly checks off the speed requirement but
how do you measure such terrific speed you have no
means of using the air blast at that rate what is the
system

   i had to develop one-but it is only accurate to about
one part in a hundred now thats near enough for our
work for ordinary speeds we use the automatically
barometrically corrected airspeedometer but this piece
of apparatus depends on the use of radio you do not
change the speed of light no matter how fast the source
is moving but for that reason if the source is moving
toward you the waves get packed in closer together than
they would ordinarily hie same is true of a radio wave
i send out a radio wave from a very small set in the nose
of the ship and pick it up by a set in the rear of the
ship by means of the usual velocity measuring appa-
ratus i find the velocity of the wave as picked up by
the set in the rear that is electrically registered here
but instead of registering it as  miles per second
with the appropriate number of tenths and hundredths of
a mile per second it subtracts the discovered value from
the correct value the difference being our speed i hope
to get it more accurate in the future but it is the only
serviceable means at hand now

   im going to try to see what the ultimate ceiling of
this machine is remember it must have a ceiling since
it depends on the operation of the generator to operate
tlie power units this in turn depends on the heat
of air of course the main power units being outside in
the suns rays are warmed to an extent by them i dont
know how high it will work

  the ship was put into a vertical climb aud steadily
the great machine rose at a low rate lest they overshoot
the mark and have the wrong result soon however
the great generator behind began to slow down the
automatic controls could not bring it up to a sufficient

speed the readings of the instruments were dropping
rapidly the temperature of the exceedingly tenuous
air outside was so close to absolute zero that it was
nearly impossible to get sufficient energy from it

  get up some forward speed so that you will have
the aid of the air scoop to force the air in faster

  right morey arcot slowly applied tlie power to
the forward propulsion units slowly they took hold and
the ship began to move forward again the increase was
apparent at once the machine quickly gained power
and she was rising again but at last at a height of
fifty-one miles the ship would rise no farther the cold
of the cabin became unbearable for every kilowatt of
power that the generator could get from the air outside
was needed to run the power units the air too was
getting had for tlie pumps could not supply enough and
the oxygen tanks had not been carried on this trip now
they were dropping dropping the machine was held
stable by the gyroscopes but she was dropping freely
tlie power of the generator being used to warm the cabin
once more but the machine had fifty miles to fall and
as die air resistance of die denser air mounted they
could begin to feel tlie weight return as the air slowed
them down in their fall

  youve passed but for the maneuvers sir the re-
quired altitude was passed so long ago-why we are
still some miles above it i guess how fast are we
falling the air inspector was decidedly impressed

   i cant tell unless i point the nose of the ship down
for the apparatus works only in the direction in which
the sliip is pointed hold on everyone i am going to
start using some power to stop us

   it was night when they returned to the little field in
vermont they had established a new record in every
form of aeronautical achievement except endurance the
altitude record the speed record the speed of climb the
acceleration record-all that arcot could think of had
been passed now the ship was coming to dock for the
night in the morning it would be out again but now
arcot was sufficiently expert with the controls to maneu-
ver tlie ship safely into the hangar they finally solved
the wind difficulty by decreasing the weight of the ship
to about fifty pounds so enabling tlie three men to
carry it into the hangar

the next two days were devoted to careful tests of
the power factors of tlie machine the best operating
frcqucncy the most efficient altitude of operation and
as many other tests as they had time for each of the
three younger men took turns operating it but so great
were the strains of the sudden acceleration that arcot
senior decided it would be wisest to stay on the ground
and watch

  in die mean time reports of the pirate liecame fewer
aud fewer as less and less money was shipped by air

  arcot spent four days practicing the manipulation of
the machine for though it handled far more readily than
any other machine he had ever controlled there was the
danger of turning on too much power under the stress
of sudden excitement yet he could not afford to lower
tlie limit of available power for there must be a margin
of at least  feet per second to cover the effects of
gravity

   if they were flying against it they would need  feet
per second per second more acceleration than if they
were flying with it the feel of the ship could lie

gotten by practice only he must make his actions in-
stinctively in emergencies and the battle with the pirate
was apt to be a long series of emergencies for certainly
the pirate had some weapons other than his gas no
standard machine gun could throw a bullet through the
inch-thick armor-plate walls of the machine and as these
were double there was slight chance of any known ship
carrying a gun heavy enough to pierce these double
walls which were yet light enough to land on the trans-
continental plane without disturbing its equilibrium

  the night before arcot had sailed the ship down and
alighted on the roof of morey seniors apartment leav-
ing enough power on to reduce the weight to but ten
tons lest it fall through the roof while he went down
to see the president of the lines about some bait for
the pirate

  send some cash along said arcot when he saw
morey sr say a quarter of a million make it more
or less public knowledge and talk it up so that the pirate
may think there is a real haul on board t am going to
accompany the plane at a height of about a quarter of a
mile above i will try to locate him from there by means
of the radio disturbance locater and if i have my appa-
ratus on  naturally cant locate him i hope he wont
be scared away-but i rather believe he wont at any
rate you wont lose on the try

again morey and arcot were looking at the great
 jersey aerodrome out on the great fields that had
been broad marshes centuries before now they had
been tilled in and stretched for miles a great landing
field close to the great city across the river

  the men in the car above were watching the field
below hanging inert a silent dot of glistening metal high
in the deep velvet of the purple sky for fifteen miles of
air separated them from the transcontinental machine
below now they saw through their field-glasses that
the great machine was lumbering slowly across the field
gaining momentum as it headed westward into the breeze
on the take-off then it seemed to be barely clearing
the great skyscrapers that towered twenty-four hundred
feet into the air arching over four or six dty blocks
from this height they were toys made of colored paper
soft colors that glistened in the hot noon sun and around
and about them were weaving lines of flashing moving
helicopters the individual lost in the mass of the million
or so swiftly moving machines for only the higher
steady moving levels of traffic were visible to them be-
low these they knew were other and still other levels of
machines hanging motionless or creeping along at thirty
or forty miles an hour rocking slightly despite the gyro-
scopic stabilizers as the terrific air-wash of thousands of
whirring blades hit them varying each moment as the
crowded traffic moved

  just look at those cars in the traffic below there
thousands and thousands coming back into the city after
going home to lunch-and every day the number of
helicopters is increasing if it hadnt been for your in-
vention of this machine they would have been impossible
soon the airblast in the cities is unbearable now and
getting worse all the time many machines cant get
enough power to hold themselves up at the middle levels
there is a down current of over one hundred miles an
hour at the -foot level in downtown new york it
takes a racer to climb fast there

  if it were not for the gyroscopic stabilizers they

could never live in that huge air-pocket i have to drive
in through there im always afraid that somebody with
an old worn-out bus will have stabilizer failure and it
will work havoc with hundreds below morey was a
skilful pilot and realized as few others did the dangers
of that downward airblast that the countless whirring
blades maintained in a constant roar of air the office
buildings now had double walls with thick layers of
sound-absorbing materials to stop the roar of the
cyclonic blast that continued almost unabated twelve
hours a day

  oh i dont know about that morey replied arcot
this thing isnt all to the good remember that if we
had about ten million machines hung in the air of new 
york city on the heat contained there would be a no-
ticeable fall in the temperature tt would undoubtedly
diop to a temperature that would produce an arctic cli-
mate year in and year out you know though how
unbearably hot it gets in the city by noon even on the
coldest winter days due to the heating effect of the air
friction of all the thousands of blades i have known the
temperature of the air to go up fifty degrees due to the
heat of the engines and die friction of the blades the
solution of the thing is obvious there will be a sort of
balance between the two types of machines it will be a
terrific economical problem but at the same time it will
solve the problem of the great companies who have been
fermenting grain residues for alcohol the castor bean
growers are also going to bring down their prices a lot
when this machine kills the market they will also be
more anxious to extract the carbon from the cornstalks
for reducing ores of iron and of other metals it will no
doubt have to be worked out eventually at any rate as
the ship flew high above the transcontinental plane the
men discussed the economic values of the different appli-
cations of arcots discoveries from the huge power sta-
tions they could make to the cooling and ventilating of
houses

  arcot you mentioned the cooling effect on new
york city with the millions on millions of these ma-
chines that there will be with huge power plants with a
thousand other different applications in use will not the
terrific drain of energy from the air cause the whole
world to become a little cooler asked fuller

  i doubt it said arcot slowly i have thought of
that myself remember that most of the energy we use
eventually ends up as heat anyway the lights we use
turn the electricity to light whence it is radiated to be ab-
sorbed by materials that convert it into heat motors
give off heat and mechanical energy the propdlers
convert the mechanical energy to motion of the mole-
cules of air-heat again the forward drive of the air-
ship is converted into heat through air-friction only the
energy we store as chemical energy is maintained-and
eventually that leaks back into the air in return just
remember the decillious of ergs of energy that the sun is
giving off-true we dont get more than an infinitesimal
portion of that energy-but what wc do get is more than
enough for us power houses can be established very
conveniently in the tropics where they will cool the air
and the energy can be used to refine metals or to stabilize
the carbon of carbon dioxide from the air i understand
from something dad said last night that that is what he
is working on now he has devised a method for clec-
trolyzing carbon dioxide in a solution in a compound
jackson worked out for him that brings us to carbon

tlie true starting- point for any organic synthesis with
that we will have ail unlimited supply of acetylene the
one indispensable hydro-carbon in modern synthesis
that means that the surplus heat of the tropics will find
a use together with the weather control possible by
the direction-controi of great winds we could set huge
director tubes on top of mountains and blow the winds
in whatever direction best suited us not the blown wind
itself but the vast volume of air it carried with it would
be able to cool the temperate zones in summer from the
cold of the poles and warm it in winter with tlie heat of
the tropics similarly the tropics would in this way
be cooled of course the control could not be perfect
hut it would bring about a vast improvement i think
however that we will find this machine to be of great
benefit i dont think it will appreciably lower the mean
temperature of the earth

   and there is another thing it may make possible in
 the future-a thing that is hard to acccpt as a commercial
 proposition we have sources of energy now but we
 have no sources of materials that will last indefinitely
 copjier is becoming more and more rare had it not
 been for the discoveries of the great copper fields of the
 sahara and in alaska we would not have any now
 platinum is exhausted and even iron is becoming more
 and more valuable for low-grade iron ores cannot be
 worked we are facing a shortage of metals alumi-
 num magnesium calcium and iron exist in vast quanti-
 ties but they are largely in low concentration ores do
 you realize that within the next two centuries we will be
 unable to maintain this civilization unless we get new
 i sources of materials history shows us civilization after
 civilization falling before the invading hordes of bar-
 barians-men who were better equipped to fight for what
 they wanted within two centuries our civilization will
 be helpless for lack of essential metals iron can be
 gotten from the frames of the skyscrapers as they are
 replaced by little glass buildings glass or silicon diox-
 ide practically constitutes a huge percentage of the
 earths crast silicon represents  and oxygen over
  so in the available matter of the earth two ele-
 ments alone constitute more than three-quarters of the
 resources luckily the next most abundant element
 and the next few are metals aluminum iron calcium
 magnesium sodium and potassium i am not certain
 about the order of calcium and magnesium together
 these total about  that means that the first seven
 abundant elements constitute  of our available re-
 sources all the other elements on earth do not total
 more than  that means that including the vast
 quantities of hydrogen nitrogen and all other non-
 metals chlorine sulphur and even carbon and many
 metals such as copper lead zinc tin silver tungsten
 molybenum berylium-all the other  elements-total
 only two per cent every time i think of those figures
 it frightens me aluminum iron and magnesium are
 useful for our work calcium sodium potassium-we
 cannot use them they are soft and so active that they
 corrode rapidly in the air in the  of the available
 matter of tlie earth three elements are useful in the
 two per cent lie all our other materials except glass
 well it looks as if we had better start using glass a great
 deal more

   rut we have one other chance now this civilization
 is doomed if we dont get more elements from some-
 where

  the solution is-there are eight planets in this solar
system  neptune and uranus are each far vaster than
earth they are utterly impossible for life as we know it
but a small colony might be established there to refine
metals for the distant earth we might be able to build
tight-closed citics but first we could try tlie nearer
planets-mars venus or some satellites such as our
moon i pray that this machine will make it possible

for some time they sat in silence in the machine as
they swept along high above the green plains of
indiana chicago lay like some monster jewel far oft on
the horizon to the right and ahead below them the huge
bulk of the transcontinental plane seemed a toy five
miles below as it swung slowly across the fields-actually
traveling over six hundred an hour they too seemed
almost motionless as the landscape swung slowly past
beneath them at last morey spoke

  you are right arcot we will have to think of the
interplanetary aspects of this some day oh isnt that
chicago off there  we had better start the vacuum gas
protector and i will turn the radio disturbance indicator
on to the general reception aerial till we see some signs
of action

  the three men forgot tlie impending danger of the
shortage of metals there were a number of adjust-
ments to make and these were quickly completed while
the machine forged evenly steadily ahead the generator
was adjusted to the maximum efficiency the various
tubes were tested separately for though they were all
new and each good for twenty-five thousand hours it
would be inconvenient to say the least if one failed while
they were in action each tested perfect and though
they could not hear tlie even hum of the generator behind
them due to the approximate vacuum at this altitude
they knew from the smooth functioning of the various
relays lliat governed it as the loads on it varied that it
must be working perfectly at something less than one-
half maximum rating there was a reassuringly large
factor of safety in all parts of this machine which was a
good thing on an experimental machine but left no factor
of safety for mr average citizens pocket book if put
on the commercial production in this form

  steadily they flew on waiting tensely for the first sign
of a glow from the tiny neon tube indicator on the panel
before morey

  this looks familiar dick said morey looking about
at the fields and the low line of the blue mountains far
oil on the western horizon i think it was about here
that we took our little nap in the flying wheel chair
as the papers called it it would be about here th-
look it is about here get ready for action fuller
youre taking the machine gun ill work the invisibility
disrupter and arcot will run the ship lets go

  on the board before him the tiny neon tube flickered
dully glowed for a moment like a piece of red-hot iron
then went out in a moment it was glowing again and
then quickly its brilliance mounted till it was a line of
crimson quickly morey snapped the switch from the
general radio disturbance detector to the beam receiver
that he might locate the machine exactly the receiving
set being arranged to pick up the signals emanating from
points in the beam only and the same control kept the
projector of the indivisibility disrupter in constant coor-
dination so that the sighting of the receiver automatically

   since this storv was written a ninth planet was discovered
piracy preferred



directed the disrupter beam at the same point quickly
the beam was scanning the sky below them as it searched
for the plane of the pirate it was fully a minute be-
fore the neon tube flashed into life once more the
pirate was flying just ahead of the big plane very likely
gassing them all around him were the air guardsmen
unaware that the enemy was so near as the disrupter
beam could be projected only about a mile they would
have to dive down on the enemy at once and an instant
later the great plane beneath them seemed to be rushing
toward them at terrific speed

  the two radio beams were constantly kept focused on
the plane of the pirate when they were about two miles
from the two machines below them the neon tube blazed
up brilliantly as the energy of the two machines clashed
the pirate was trying to maintain his invisibility while
the rapidly growing strength of the machine above was
trying to batter it down the resulting interference radiat-
ing a large amount o energy the strength of moreys
beam was growing at a tremendous rate as the two ma-
chines approached at nearly three hundred miles an lour
in a moment the ammeter connected with the disrupter
beam began to rise so rapidly it seemed dangerous for
despite the ten-kilowatt set being used to project the
beam the resistance of the apparatus on board the pirate
ship was amazing now however there was a rapidly
solidifying cloud before them as the interference of
the beam morey was sending broke down the molecular
oscillation that permitted the light to pass freely through
the machine suddenly there was a circle of blue light
about the shadow form and a moment later the ionized
air relapsed into normal condition as the pirates appa-
ratus broke down under the strain at once morey shut
off his apparatus convinced from the suddenness that
the pirates apparatus had been blown out the tubes
unable to stand the strain of the larger tubes on board
their machine he glanced up to look at the pirate as he
finished his job he cried out in astonishment as arcot
called to him morey-look at him go

  morey was too late to see him go already the plane
had shot off with terrific speed it had shot up and to
their left at a rate of climb that seemed unlelievablc-
except that the long trail of flaming gas told the story
the plane was propelled by rockets the terrific accel-
eration carried it out of their range oi vision in an in-
stant and as arcot swung the ship to bring him again
within the range of the windows they gasped in aston-
ishment for already he was many miles away a long
trail of flaming gas marking his swift flight there was
a terrific wrench as arcot threw on all the power he
dared then quickly leveled the machine out following
the pirate at lighting speed he increased the accelera-
tion further as the men grew accustomed to the force
that weighed them down ahead of them the pirate was
racing along but quickly now they were overhauling him
for his machine had wings of a sort they produced a
tremendous amount of head resistance at their present
velocity for already the needle of the radio speedometer
had moved over to one mile a second they were follow-
ing the fleet plane ahead at the rate of  miles an
hour the roar of the air outside was a tremendous
wave of sound yet to them protected by the vacuum of
the double walls it was detectable only by the vibration
of the car

  and naturally the rarefaction of the air operated to
reduce the sound

rapidly the lead of the pirates machine was cut
down as their acceleration became greater it
seemed but a moment before he would be within range
of their machine gun suddenly he nosed down and shot
for the ground ten miles below with the full speed of
his machine in an instant arcot had swung his machine
in a loop that held him close to the tail of the pirate
the swift maneuvers at this speed were a terrific
strain on both men and machines-the acceleration
seemed crushing them with the weight of four men as
arcott followed the pirate in a wide loop to the right
that ended in a straight climb the power rocket ship
standing on its tail the rocket blast roaring out behind a
stream of fire a half mile long it was climbing at a
speed that would have distanced any other machine the
world had ever seen but the tenacious opponent behind
him clung ever tighter to the tiny darting thing he
had released great clouds of his animation suspending
gas to his utter surprise the ship behind had driven
righl through it entirely unaffected he who knew
most about the gas had been tillable to devise a material
to stop it a mask or a tank to store it yet in some way
these men had succeeded and that hurtling bullet-
shaped machine behind like some miniature airship it
was but with a speed and an acceleration that put even
his to shame it could twist turn dive rise and shoot
off on the straight-away with more flashing speed than
his machine displayed time and again he tried com-
plicated maneuvers that strained him to the utmost yet
that machine always followed after him

   there was one thing to do in outer space his rockets
would support him in a straight climb he shot up to the
blazing sun above out into space while the sky around
him grew black and the stars shone in solemn splendor
around him but he had eyes for only one thing the
shining car that was rising with more than equal speed
behind him he knew he must be climbing over two
thousand miles an hour yet the tracker came ever closer
just out of sighting range for the machine gun now   
in a moment    but she was faltering

   the men in the machine behind sat white-lipped tense
as the whirling shocks of sudden turns at terrific speed
twisted the gyroscope seats around like peas in a rolling
ball up down left right the darting machine ahead
was twisting with unbelievable speed then suddenly
the nose was pointed for the zenith again and with a
great column of flame shooting out behind him he was
heading straight toward space

   if he gets there t lose him morey i said arcot the
terrific acceleration of the climbing car seemed to press
them to their seats with a deadly weight it was a
laborto talk-but still the car ahead was shooting ahead
-slowly they seemed to be overhauling him now
that the velocities were perforce lowered by the effects of
gravity and the air resistance of the atmosphere was
well nigh gone only the acceleration that the human body
could stand was considered the man ahead was pushing
his plane ahead with an acceleration that would have
killed many men

  slowly the acceleration of the machine was falling
arcot pushed the control over to the last ampere and
felt the slight surge as greater power rushed through the
coils momentarily soon this was gone too as the gen-
erator behind faltered the driving power of the atmos-
pheric heat was gone more than sixty miles below them
they could see the earth as a greenish brown surface


amazing stories

slightly convex and far to the east they could distin-
guish a silvery line of water but they had no eyes but
for the column of shooting lianie that represented the
fleeing raider out in airless space now he was safe
from them they could not follow arcot turned the
machine once more parallel to the earth watching the
plane above through the roof window slowly the
machine sank to the fifty-mile level where there was
just sufficient air to maintain it in efficient operation

  well he beat us but there is only one thing for us
to do he must hang there on his rockets till we leave
and we can hang here indefinitely if we can only keep
this cabin decently warm lie has no air to cool him and
he has the sun to warm him the only thing that is
worrying him right now is the heat of his rockets but
he can throw most of that out with the gases lord
thats some machine the principle is easy to see he
uses his atomic hydrogen stored in the way he has and
thereby can store in very little space a gaseous material
that yields  calories for every two grams he
can run a real machine on that but eventually his
rockets will give out and down he will come so we will
just hang here beneath him and-whoa-not so fast-
he isnt going to stay there it seems he is angling ins
ship off a bit and shooting along so that besides holding
himself up he is making a little forward progress we
will have tn follow  he is going to do some speeding it
seems well we can keep up to him at our level

  dick no plane ever made before would have stood the
terrific pulls and yanks that his plane got he was steer-
ing and twisting on the standard type air rudders and
what strains he had that unique type of plane must
be extremely strong i never saw one shaped like his
before though-it is the obvious shape at that it was
j ust a huge triangular arrowhead did you ever see one
like it

  something like it yes and so have you dont you
recognize that as the development of the old paper
gliders you used to throw around as a kid it lias the
same shape the triangular wings with the point in the
lead except that he undoubtedly has a slight curve to
the wings to increase the efficiency i hope that man is
only a kleptomaniac because he can be cured of that
and i can then have a new laboratory partner he has
some exceedingly intelligent ideas his idea of copying
the birds was good-except that he carried it too far
the idea of flying was good but the birds have a method
that man cant imitate the birds have flapping wings
and their wings are shaped to work well when they flap
man tried for a while to make a machine that would flap
its wings he generally got killed in the attempt
finally he decided to try having the wings there just as
the birds do but not flapping them he tried to- imitate
the bird in gliding flight that was rather foolish for
the birds wings are made to flap and when they glide
they are using them for a secondary purpose man stands
on two jointed bone columns carefully made and fitted
together with some of the most wonderful mechanical
features we know of why not build buildings and
stand them on similar mechanisms simply because legs
have oidy a secondary use in supporting members they
were primarily designed for locomotion

  similarly a birds wings were designed for movement
then too a rotary motion is so much more efficient than
a reciprocating motion the wheel is beyond a doubt
a better way to get over ground than the leg why didnt

nature use it  a wheel is not such a good thing to climb
trees with and trees are very useful if a saber tooth
tiger happens to be in the neighborhood evolution did
not favor it can you imagine a bird with a propeller on
its beak  the propeller is more efficient than the flapping
wing but nature couldnt use it-it was a matter of
design imagine if you can a bird with a bone propeller
on its lieak-or somewhere driven by a hone crankshaft
turned by muscles--muscles arranged like the cylinders
of an engine it just couldnt be done nature had to use
the flapping wing

  and man seeing the bird fly decided that was the
way ti fly he found he couldnt do it but it took him
hundreds of years to find some other way than merely
approximating the bird

  di you remember how the little paper gliders of our
school days used to soar and bank and turn with perfect
control they never stalled in the air never stayed in a
nose dive never went into tail spins and were structually
strong enough to be made of thin paper the standard
and only figure that is used in bracing things anywhere
is the triangle it is the unit of strength it cant be
deformed as can a square it is geometrically belter why
not use it no wonder the pirates ship would stand
the strains he put on it no wonder it makes an excellent
glider of course it would

  he is an ingenious man but i wish he didnt store
quite so much hydrogen in his rocket tubes it is un-
bearably cold in here and i cant sacrificc any power to
heat it the rocket ship up there seems to be getting
more and more acceleration in the level he has me
dropping steadily to get air to run the generator he is
going fast enough

  they followed beneath the pirate faster and faster as
the rockets of the ship began to push it forward more
and more

  dick why is it he didnt use all his rockets at first
instead of gradually increasing the power this way

  if you were operating the ship morey you would
understand look at the speedometer a moment and see
if you can figure it out i

  hina- miles per second-buzzing right along-
but i dont see what that-good lord we never will
get him at this rate how do you expect to get him

  i am still in the dark on that subject but arcot
i wonder why it is that he doesnt have to use all his
rockets said fuller

  he is going  miles a second when he reaches 
miles a second he will never come down from his hundred
and fifty mile high perch he will establish an orbit
he has so much centrifugal force already that he has
very little weight we are staying right beneath him so
we dont have much either wei  there he goes in a last
spurt wc are falling behind pretty fast-there we are
catching up now-no-we are just holding parallel
hes done it look

arcot pulled out his watch and let go of it it
floated calmly in the air for a moment then slowly
drifted back toward the rear of the room i am using a
bit of acceleration-a bit more than enough to maintain
our speed wc are up high enough to make the air
resistance almost nothing even at this velocity but we
are held back enough to require some power i dont
know-

  there was a low buzz repeated twice instantly morey
piracy preferred



turned the dials o the radio receiving set-again the call
signal sounded in a moment a voice came in-low but
distinct the power seemed fading rapidly

  -am the pirate-help if you can can you get

outside the atmosphere exceed orbital speed and fall
out  am in an orbit and cant get out fuel reserve gage
stuck and used all my rockets no more power can
not slow down and fall i am running out of compressed
air and the generator for this set is going-will take
animation suspending gas-will you be able to reach me
before entering night

  quick morey-answer that we will

  we will try pirate-think we can make it

 o k-power about-now-

  the last of his power had failed the pirate was
marooned in space they had seen his rockets go out
leaving the exhaust tube glowipg for a moment before it
too was dark and only tlie sun shining on tlie silvery
plane made it visible

  we have to hurry if we want to do anything before
he reaches night radio the san francisco fields that
we will be coming in soon and we need a large electro-
magnet-one designed to work on about  volts d c
and some good sized storage cells how many will have
to be decided later depending on the room we will have
for them i will start to slew down the ship now we
are somewhere west of the hawaiians i believe but we
ought to be able to do tlie trick if we use all the power
we can

  morey at once set to work with the radio set to raise
san francisco airport he was soon in communication
with them and told them that he would be there in about
one hour they promised all the necessary materials
also that they would get ready to receive the pirate when
he was finally brought in to them

  arcot asked fuller why dont you just circle
around and head back taking advantage of your speed
instead of killing it in one direction only to develop more
in tlie other

  the circle i would have to turn in would have to
have a thousand mile radius because any smaller circle
would mean a centrifugal force that would he fatal to us
i will be able to turn soon but i must slow down first

  it was nearer an hour and a quarter later that the
macliine fell to tlie great san francisco landing field
where the mechanics at once set to work bolting a huge
electro-magnet on the landing skids on the bottom of
the machine the most serious problem was connecting
the terminals electrically without making holes in the hull
of the ship finally one terminal was grounded and the
radio aerial used as the other fuller was left behind on
this trip and a large number of cells were installed in
every possible position in the power room a hastily
arranged motor generator set was arranged making it
possible to nm the entire ship from the batteries
scarcely had these been battened down to prevent slid-
ing under die accelerations necessary than arcot aud
morey were off the entire operation had required but
fifteen minutes

  how are you going to catch him arcot

  ill overtake him going west if i went the other
way id meet him going at over  miles a second in
relation to his machine he had the right idea he
told me to fall out to him at greater than orbital speed
i will go just within the earths atmosphere till i get just
under him holding myself in the air by means of a down-

warti acceleration on the part of the regular lifting power
units i am going to try to reach eight miles a second
we will be overhauling him at three a second and the
ship will slow down to the right speed in falling out to
him we must reach him before he gets into the shadow
of the earth though for if he reaches night he will be
without heat and despite the fact that he is in a suspended
animation condition he will die of cold i think we can
reach him dick

   i hope so those spare cells are all right arent they
this acceleration is hard on anything we will need
those if they dont function when we get out there
we will fall clear off into space at eight miles a second
we would leave earth forever

  but dick i dont see how you can get eight miles
a second when helium atoms at room temperature dont
move that fast they wont drive a car that fast will
they 

  right you are morey-but for one fact how fast
are helium atoms going at room temperature  earth goes
nineteen miles a second so they must be going fast
enough they are always trying to go just six or seven
miles a second faster than we no matter how fast we
go it will be willing to drive us at eight miles a second
but we dont want to get too high and find the generator
wont give power enough to slow us down so we can fall
nor power enough to pull us down against centrifugal
force

   the ship was accelerating steadily at the highest value
tlie men aboard could stand safely the needle of the
speedometer was creeping steadily across the dial they
were flying at a height of forty miles that they might
have enough air and still not he too greatly hindered
by air resistance the black sky above them was spotted
with points of glowing light the blazing stars of spacc
but as they flew along tlie sensation of weight was
lost they had reached orbital speed and as the car
steadily increased its velocity there came a strange sen-
sation the cajth loomed gigantic above them be-
low them shone the sun the direction of up and
down was changed by the terrific speed the needle of
the speedometer was wavering at  miles a second
now it held steady

   i thought you were going to take it up to eight miles
a second dick

   air resistance is too great ill have to go higher
at a height of fifty miles they continued at  miles
a second it seemed hours before they reached the
spot where the pirates machine should be flying directly
above them and they searched the black sky for some
sign of the shining dot of light with the aid of field
glasses they found it far ahead and nearly one hundred
miles above things here in the clear space were far
more visible than they would have been if seen through
the dull atmosphere

  well here we go im going to fall up the hundred
miles or so till we are right on his path the work done
against gravity will slow us down a little but i will have
to use the power units somewhat did you notice what
i did to them

  yes they were painted a dull black what was the
idea

  we will have no air from which to get heat for
power out here so we will have to use sunlight i am
using it now to slow us down as much as possible that
together with the air resistance and the energy needed


amazing stories

for raising the car one hundred miles will be enough to
slow us down i think

  at last the tiny silver dot had grown till it took on the
form of the plane it was they were drawing up to it
now slowly but steadily at last the little machine was
directly beneath them and a scant hundred yards away
they had long since been forced tu run the machine on
the storage batteries and now they applied a little power
to the vertical power units sluggishly as they absorbed
the suns heat the machine was forccd lower nearer
to the machine below at last a scant ten feet separated
them

  all right morey

there was a snap as the temporary switch was
closed and the current surged into the big magnet
on the keel at once they felt the ship jump a little under
the impulse of the magnets pull on the smaller machine
in a moment the little plane had drifted up to the now
idle magnet touchcd it and was about to bounce off when
morey again snapped the switch shut and the two
machines were locked firmly together

  ive got him dick now slow it down till it falls
then we can go and wait for it being a glider it ought
to be quite manageable

  now the energy of the power units on the roof of
the machine began to slow down the two machines the
magnet grinding slightly as the momentum of the plane
was thrust upon it they watched the speedometer needle
drop the speed was sinking very slowly for the area
of the absorbing fins was not designed to absorb the suns
heat directly and was very inefficient the sun was
indeed sinking below their horizon they were just be-
ginning to watch that curious phenomenon of seeing
dawn backward when they first struck air dense enough
to operate the power units noticeably quickly the power
was applied till the machines sank rapidly to the warmer
levels the only governing factor being the tendency ol
the glider to break loose from the grip of the magnet
at fifty miles the generator was started and the
heaters in the car at once became more active there
was no heat in the car below but that was unavoidable
they would try to bring it down to warm levels quickly

  whew im glad we reached the air again dick i
didnt tell you sooner for it wouldnt have done any good
but that battery was about gone we had something
like twenty amp-hours left  am giving the recharge
generator all she will take we seem to have plenty of
power now

  i knew the cells were low but i had no idea they
were as low as that i noticed that the magnet was
weakening but thought it was due to the added air strain

i	am going to put the thing into a nose dive and let the
glider go down of itself i know it would land correctly
if it had a chancc i am going to follow it of course
and since we are over the middle of siberia i think it
would be a good idea to start back

  the trip back was necessarily in the lower levels of
the atmosphere that the glider might be kept reasonably
warni at a height of but two miles in the turbulent
atmosphere the glider was brought slowly home tt took
them nearly twenty hours to go the short distance of
twelve thousand miles to san francisco the two men
taking turns at the controls the air resistance of the
glider forced them to go slowly they could not average

much better than six hundred an hour despite the fact
that the speed of either machine alone was over twelve
hundred miles an hour

  at last the great skyscrapers of san francisco were
showing on their horizon and thousands of private planes
started out to meet them frantically arcot warned
them away lest the air blast from their props tear the
glider from the magnet at last however the air guard
was able to force them to a safe distance and clear a
lane through one of the lower levels of the city traffic
the great field of the transcontinental lines was packed
with excited men and women waiting to catch a glimpse
of two of the greatest tilings the country had heard of
in the century-arcots molecular motion machine and
the air pirate

  the landing was made safely in the circle of air
guardsmen there was a small hospital plane standing
beside it in a moment and as arcots ship released it and
then hung motionless soundless above it the people
watched it in wonder and excitement they wanted to
see arcot perform they clamored to see the wonderful
powers of this ship in operation air guardsmen who
had witnessed the flying game of tag between these two
super-air-machines had told of it through the press and
over the radio

  come on morey lets give them a real show then
go home and sleep

  all right bill the invisibility act ought to give
them a thrill

  there was a sliarp click as morey turned on a switch-
then from the crowd below came a mighty roar of amaze-
ment the ship was gone gone completely in an in-
stant they turned to each other in astonished inquiry
and then came another cry of astonishment as it suddenly
appeared hanging in the air a thousand feet above the
point of its disappearance then it began a series of
loops turns twists and maneuvers utterly impossible
to any other machine it hung motionless in the air for
an instant then shot up toward the hot mid-afternoon
sun with a speed that left the watchers gasping with
astonishment-and continued on its way to new york

  two weeks later arcot had a visitor from the west
coast-a handsome young man of about twenty-eight
morey was with him at the time the young visitor
looked rather pale but his six-feet-three made even
morey look to his laurels

  well i heard you were of fairly good size wade
and it is no wonder we had such a whale of a chase
catching you said arcot smiling at him j ust think
even old earth couldnt throw you down we had to go
out and help bring you in but speaking seriously t
hope you have brought your tilings with you because if
you are willing i think the transcontinental can afford
to let me have a new lab worker dr marsh says you
will be a great help to me now after looking over your
different pieces of apparatus both at the rocky moun-
tain perch as you called it and in the plane i am of the
opinion that we had better keep all the good rivals in the
family so to speak that was a neat piece of work on
the storage of atomic oxygen is it all right for you to
get the old head to work so soon

  dr marsh seemed to think so dr arcot and i am
not in the habit of forcing opportunity to bruise his
knuckles i am with you but if the idea for the
atomic hydrogen storage comes through-

a serial in three parts-part ii

by edmond hamilton

author of the other side of the moon locked worlds etc

jvteptzjne is nearly three thousand millions of miles from the sun but that does
not necessarily mean that some kind of life is absolutely impossible on it it may
be of course if there are intelligent beings on that planet that they in their turn are
convinced that even the earth is uninhabitable because it must be so unendurably hot
being so close to a great heat-giving mass creatures may well have evolved on that
distant planet to fit with the conditions there just as human beings as we know them
are adapted to our particular atmosphere at any rate this well-known author gives
us a picturesque and striking idea on this subject and in this second instalment con-
tinues his tale of neptunian life and intelligence at an accelerating pace-almost
equal to the increase of rotatory speed these creatures are forcing on our sun from
their point of view these extraordinary creatures feel justified in threatening all the
nearer planets it seems inevitable however that our view on earth should differ

illustrated by wesso

what went before

tefhen tin scientific world confirms dr minims observations on ill
alarmingly perceptible increase in the rotatory speed of tlie min
matters have taken a aerioua turn during a conference at the capitol
at which a number of eminent astronomers are present various theories
are propounded as to the cause of this accelerating speed and its effect
on the barth they are convinced that the cause whatever it may be
is on neptnne and that several men must he sent in neptune to learn
the cause and perhaps find u cure

   the impossible is accomplished a space-flier in built and outfitted
in record time and is sent on its way with three scientists-drs marlin
wlately randall markham-and hunt who is to report on the
findings and the trip hunt is the relator of the story four space-
vulkers specially designed to he used by the men outside of the space-
flier in interplanetary space in case of an cmcrgcncv are also included
among the accessories

   all goes well until the space-flier reaches the asteroid nono where
they are iu imminent danger they escape with only minor dam
ages which they repair in open space by means of the space-walkers
a comparatively short time later they come within the atmosphere of
neptune and find that planets surface completely covered by a metal
roof they go along and above this roof until they come to a circular
opening through which they enter once beneath the metal shield
they sec vast luunpartmentcitieb with counties strange structures they
decide to separate so marlin and hunt in the space-walkers venture
further to learn about neptune and the disk-like beings that prove
to bo the inhabitants of this planet

   in the midat of their investigations hunt and marlin look up to see
the space-ship attacked by the neptunians and part of it rent asunder
they continue on ibeir way bemoaning the loss of their friends but
more intent than evor to find the caupe of the trouble soon they
are discovered by some of these disk-like creatures who immediately
after the foremost one utters a staccato cry fling themselves straight
forward upon marlin and hunt

chapter vii

the giant ray

the minute that followed was a grotesque
whirl of swift action a desperate reeling
struggle between marlin and me eased in our
great space-walkers and the great disk-
bodied neptunians even as they had leaped
upon us we had shot to one side had brought down upon
the foremost of them the great steel bars carried in our
pincer-like metal hands and had sent two of than crum-
pling to the black paving with a thick green liquid oozing
from their shattered bodies the remainder though
were upon us before we could strike again and then as
they gripped us i could see the neptunians who had been
working in the adjoining compartment come running
toward the combat to assist their fellows so that
though marlin and i struck out with desperate fury
at the monstrous creatures with the great metal jointed
arms of our space-walkers they had in a moment more
with their numberless limbs fettered our arms and torn

the bars from our grasp holding us then motionless and
helpless

  thus held part of the creatures stepped back from us
and then we heard one of them who bore a single
crimson-circle device upon his metal dress or armor
utter a staccato order to the others at once four of
them drew from their armor the long- tubes we had
noted there and trained them upon us i knew in-
stinctively that those tabes held some deadly force like
rhat with which the cylinders had attacked our space-
flier in the battle in mid-air later i was to learn that
the tubes could release a force-ray similar to that used
for propulsion by our space-flier and by the cylinders-
a force-ray so concentrated into a pencil-like beam that
instead of merely pressing against whatever it struck
it pierced whatever it touched with terrific force riving
it asunder knowing the deadliness of the tubes i
looked for instant annihilation

  but it was evident in a moment that it was only as a
precaution that the tubes were held upon us for now
while a half-score of the neptnnians held marlin and
me firmly by the arms of our space-walkers the one who
had given the order came closer to us clambered with his
powerful multiple limbs upon the top of my space-walker
and gazed in through its vision-windows at me to see
those bulging glassy and insect-like eyes outside the
window so close to my own struck me through with a
chilling horror greater than anything i had yet felt
i saw that the creature had discerned me inside the space-
walker had assured himself that creatures of life yet
different from himself occupied the two cylinders for
in a moment he had clambered back down to the ground
and then as he-uttered another sharp order the creatures
that held us were dragging us forward toward the door
of the compartment into which we had looked before

  through that low door they dragged us in our space-
walkers and across the adjoining compartment toward one
of the great upright cylinders resting there in another
moment the neptunians had pulled us inside the door of
that cylinder into its dark opening and i saw the one who
had given the orders following with a half-dozen of his
fellows the others were dispersing to the other cylin-
ders and in a moment the door of our own slid clanging
shut behind us then there was a hissing and throbbing
of strange machinery in the dark interior of the cylinder
about us and at the same moment the leader of the nep-
tunians motioned to us to emerge from our space-
walkers having removed their own glowing ball-heaters

  i think that both marlin and i hesitated for a long
moment before complying with that command yet we
saw that upon us still were trained the tubes of the four
neptunians who guarded us so reluctantly we threw
open the lower doors of the space-walkers and emerged
from them as we did so forgetful for the moment of
the strange creatures about us we gazed in amazed in-
terest around us the huge cylinders interior we saw
was divided into a half-dozen compartments by metal
floors or ceilings set at intervals of ten or twelve feet
from its bottom to its top a light metal ladder ran
tip through openings in all of the those floors or divisions
and up that ladder now a few of the many-limbed nep-
tunians were hurrying toward the upper compartments
we ourselves were standing with the neptunian leader
of the red circle-insignia in the lowest or bottom com-
partment of the cylinder his four tube-armed guards and
a half-dozen green disk-bodied monsters about us

  that lowest compartment held great gleaming-cased
mechanisms from which came the throbbing that we had
already heard and that was so exactly similar to the
throb of our space-fliers generators as to remove all
doubt but that these were the similar generators of the
cylinder as our eyes roved about them the neptunian
leader uttered a staccato command at the same time
pointing with one of his seven limbs up toward the
ladder his meaning was unmistakable and at once
marlin and i stepped toward the ladder and began to
climb upward on it the tubes of the four watchful guards
just beneath us as they followed as we passed up that
ladder through the upper sections of the cylinders in-
terior i saw vaguely the things within those sections

  one of them held the dissembled parts of the great
cogged mechanisms we had seen them taking down and
storing inside the cylinders another two or three sec-
tions held similar dissembled parts of differing machines
that had evidently been taken from another part of the
dead vast compartment-city beneath we passed up
through sections that held supplies and strange tank-like
affairs that seemed not unlike the batteries of our own
space-flier and then were climbing up into the topmost
section of the cylinder this was a section whose top
and walls were set with so many windows as to make
its sides seem quite transparent and this topmost
section in which a pair of neptunians already were
standing was quite apparently the control-scction

  for at its center rose from its floor a tluck metal pillar
or standard upon the top and sides of which were set a
battery of dozens of small green studs and around this
were strange seats in which the two waiting neptunians
were now taking their places as marlin and i climbed
into that uppermost section the guards and the leader of
the disk-bodied neptunians behind us we gazed won-
deringly about at the central control-standard and at
the srrange graduated scales with moving dots of light
upon them that were set here and there in the walls
and that seerned recording instruments of one kind or
another then the crimson-marked leader liad given
utterance to another sharp succession of snapping sounds

  swift command at the same time motioning us to the
side of the circular room where were similar low strange
seats in these we seated ourselves the four neptunians
who watchcd us taking places on either side of us and
then as the leader took the remaining seat at the control-
standard we saw one of the other two seated there reach
forth with strange quick limbs and touch a number of
the studs in swift succession

  at once the  great throbbing of the generators or
mechanisms in the cylinders lowest section intensified
and as marlin and i gazed quickly outward through the
windows about us we saw that now the other cylinders
in the compartment were all closed and throbbing- like
this one then as one of the neptunians at the control-
standard touched another stud the cylinder in which
we were rose swiftly upward and out of the great black-
walled compartment rose up smoothly over the dead
compartment-city into the pale light of the neptunian
day followed at once by the three other cylinders the
dim day about us was already waning fading as night
crept across this huge world of silence and death with
its ceaseless rotation but there remained still enough
light for us to see far across the mighty maze of compart-
ments that was the deserted and dead city and now
across that city the four cylinders were rushing racing
the universe wreckers



over it in horizontal position the strange seats upon
which we and the neptunians were seated swinging in
gimbal-like frameworks as the cylinder swung thus from
vertical to horizontal

over the huge compartment-city our four cylinders
flashed then slowed and halted as up from another
point in it rose four more cylinders the four that we had
seen land in a different part of it and whose occupants
had discovered and captured us then all of the eight
great cylinders our own in the lead were rising sharply
upward tip toward the opening in the vast roof above
through which we had seen them come as they shot
up toward it marlin and i glancing down and backward
could see even as we had seen from our space-fiier the
vast extent of the dead and deserted compartment-city
with its mechanisms and huge globes and high black inter-
secting walls lying now in such dusty silence and death
yet it was only for a moment that we glanced back
toward it for now our eighl cylinders were flashing up
through the round opening in the huge roof and out over
that vast roof seeming solid metal from above that
covered all of mighty neptune and as wc flashed over
it now i found for the first time opportunity to whisper
to marlin beside me

  theyre leaving neptune i whispered where
fcan they be going marlin  and what lias happened to
whitely and randall 

  lie shook his head answered in tire same low tones
whitely and randall have escaped i hope they had a
small start on their pursuers-they may have eluded them
here above neptune-

  we were abruptly silent as the guards glanced sus-
piciously toward us with their bulging multiple eyes
and as the great cylinder and those behind shot on the
huge metal roof of neptune below and the vast vapor-
masses of its dense atmosphere stretched above us i
wondered if ever men had found themselves in the
position that now was ours captured by monstrous
disk-bodied beings of horror unutterable flashing with
them above the vast roof that sheathed neptune and its
dead deserted and colossal compartment-city to a des-
tination of which we could not dream and as that
thought passed another came and i remembered the
great mission that had brought us out here to the terrors
of mighty neptune our great flight outward to fird and
put an end to the huge force-ray that was stabbing across
the solar system and turning the sun ever faster with
every day bringing it nearer to the division that meant
doom for almost all its universe what chance was ours
to accomplish that mission now separated and captured
as we were not knowing even from what source the
great ray was issuing from what strange place these disk-
bodied beings had come and to which they were now
returning

  i was aroused from my silent despair though by a
low exclamation from marlin and looked up to see that
the cylinders of which our own was foremost had now
halted hanging midway between metal roof beneath and
great vapor-masses above then down from above i saw
dropping quickly toward us three other cylinders similar
to the eight three cylinders at sight of which my heart
beat suddenly faster for it had been three cylinders
that had pursued whitely and randall in the space-fiier
tensely i watched as the three drove down among our
eight and then one of them had shot suddenly close to

the cylinder in which we were hanging beside it so that
its low door-opening was directly touching the door-
opening of our own there was a clang of metal beneath
as the doors of both cylinders slid aside they fitted so
closely against each other that no colder air from without
could enter into the warmed interior of the two cylinders
then from the other were coining into our own cylinder
three neptunians who climbed swiftly up into the top-
section in which we were while marlin and i watched
them in indescribable suspense

  as they came up into the uppermost section they
spoke in their sharp staccato talk to the neptunian leader
of the crun-son-circle insignia making report to him it
was apparent but it was not to their snapping speech
that marlin and t gave our attention but to the things
they carried in their grip and which they were showing
to the leader those tilings i saw with a start of horror
were some shattered and crumpled plates of metal great
flat metal plates that i recognized immediately as being
of our space-fliervfaceted sides and they also held
a broken twisted metal thing that i recognized in-
stantly as one of the space-iliers smaller liquid-oxygen
tanks i needed not to understand the strange speech of
the neptunians in that moment to understand what the
three were reporting for those shattered fragments of
the space-fiier told the tale with terrible clearness

  whitely and randall it was marlins whisper of
horror beside me they were caught by those pursuing
cylinders-were annihilated by their rays-

  whitely and randall- i felt my voice choke

then as i gazed at those last fragments of the space-
fliers wreckage mutely testifying to the end which our
friends had met with beneath the shattering rays in their
space-flier somewhere in the cold vast vapor-masses
above us

  whitely-cool and dctachcd and steady stirred to pas-
sion by nothing save some unprecedented physical phe-
nomenon considering with curious impersonal eyes each
new peril that had confronted us and randall-with
his sunny hair and eager young courage and unfailing
sense of fun it was as though they had risen before me
in that moment when wc saw at last what death had
overtaken them and our space-flier there in the chill
clouds of mighty neptune t felt marlins steadying
hand on my shoulder and knew that he was sounding
similar depths of despair for with whitely and randall
gone with our space-fiier and with ourselves captured
and held hv these monstrous disk-bodied neptunians
who yet seemed not of neptune our chance to halt the
great doom-ray that was radiating toward the sun our
chance even lo return to earth with word of the position
and nature of that rays source was gone also

  through the despair that had sunken upon me i was
aware in a moment that the throbbing of the cylinders
great generators had waxed again in intensity already
the three neptunians who had reported the destruction
of the space-flier had returned to their own cylinder
which had separated from ours and now the whole eleven
cylinders our own in the lead were racing forward once
more were shooting forward between the great vapor-
masses above and the vast metal roof below at im-
mense and mounting speed they shot forward a dull
roar of whistling air coming to us from without and in
a riioment the pale dim light about us had begun to
change to dnsk to darkness as we shot on for the
eleven cylinders were racing around the surface of nep-

stories

tune toward the side o it away from the sun at the
moment and as they entered the shade of that side they
were plunging through the eternal night but as the
cylinders shot on they seemed to need no light or star
to guide them through the deep darkness though all that
was visible was an occasional glinting of the great metal
roof below

  on we shot through that deep darkness and there
rose in mea sudden thought that roused me a little from
tlie despair that held marlin and me could it be that
upon that other side there still remained a remnant ox
their race a remnant of the race that once had built
the mighty compartment-city that covered all neptune
and the vast roof that shielded it but that now occupied
but a small part of the huge city was it from nep-
tunes other side then that the giant force-ray had
stabbed toward the sun yet how could that be so
how could that great ray be shot out from any point of
neptune unceasingly as it was when each twenty hours
the great planet turned on its axis when for half of that
twenty hours whatever point that was the rays source
would be turned away from the sun instead of toward it 

with tense interest marlin and i gazed ahead into
the darkness through which our cylinders were
rushing while at the control-standard the leader and the
other two neptunians manipulated the force-rays that
were propelling onward the cylinder in which we were
at last after some minutes of this rushing flight of im-
mense velocity the cylinders seemed to slow down to
pause looking out i could discern the surface of the
gigantic metal roof below us just showing itself to us
by a little glint of light here and there from it and in
that moment marlin and i waited in suspense for the
cylinders to sink down toward and through it to what-
ever place upon neptunes other side it was that held
the remainder of their strange races since by then we
knew wc were at that side of neptune almost exactly
opposite tlie sun only a moment the cylinders slowed
and paused and then were leaping through the air again
at mounting speed but instead of flashing downward-
toward the great roof they were flashing upward

  upward they were shooting up through the dense air
and straight into die great vapor-masses that loomed
above us through those great clouds they were racing
then driving upward through them as through a darker
darkness and then suddenly had shot up and out from
them up and out into the clear raid thinner air of
neptunes atmospheres outermost limits behind our
cylinders thus lay the huge vapor-wreathed planet shut-
ting out by its vast bulk all sight of the suns distant little
disk of fire or of the greater planets but before us
there stretched once more the black vault of space un-
folding itself to our eyes for the first time since we had
ventured down through those shrouding vapors to nep-
tunes surface

  brightest in that black void there shone before and
somewhat above us triton the moon of neptune it
was almost white in color tinged with the pale green of
great neptune about which it moved and seeming of
the same size to our eyes as earths own moon beyond
and all about it though there flamed the great stars
seeming the same to our eyes here at the solar systems
outermost limits as they had seemed to us when far
within it at earth the great field of stars and slar-
clusters that was sagittarius- straight ahead and upward

the irregular parallelogram of capricorns stars to the
loft the throbbing crimson heart and jeweled menacing
claws of scorpio to the right-all seemed to our eyes
as they had seemed when we had started-how long ago
it seemed-out from earth toward great neptune that
lay now behind us yet now with neptune behind us
our eleven cylinders were flashing forward with greater
and greater speed were hashing out apparently from the
solar systems last outpost into the vast void of inter-
stellar space

  theyre going on-going out from neptune into outer
space i exclaimed to marlin as we gazed ahead trans-
fixed

  but suddenly lie shook his head pointing ahead aiid
upward for now the cylinders were flashing upward as
well as forward its triton theyre heading toward
he said triton-neptunes single moon

  triton i exclaimed thunderstruck with amazement
then-then-it must be on triton that the remaining
neptunians now are

  triton for it was up toward it up toward the white
green-tinged moon of neptune that shone dully in the
black vault above and ahead of us that the eleven cylin-
ders our own in the lead were heading and as they
shot out of the last limits of the atmosphere of neptune
as they flashed forward at swiftly mounting speed still
toward the moon i could but stare at it in amazement
triton it was from it then that there had come these
strange disk-bodied neptunians who had captured us
who had annihilated our space-flier and our friends it
was on triton then that there must remain whatever
neptunians still were left of those who had built the vast
compartmcnt-city that eovcred all the surface of neptune
itself who had shielded it with that gigantic floating roof
that enclosed all the mighty planet yet why had they
deserted their vast compartment-city their great world
of neptune  why had they left that world for the single
moon of neptune so much smaller in size and the
giant force-ray that was shooting across space to the
sun turning it ever faster was it from neptune then or
triton that that colossal ray was radiating

  it seemed to me that these questions were spinning
in my head in a kaleidoscopic whirl of enigmas as our
throbbing cylinder and the ten behind it shot on and
upward at a great slant toward the dull-gleaming sphere
of triton marlin beside me was staring ahead ob-
viously as much mystified as i was while the four nep-
tunians ranged on either side of us kept their ceaseless
watch upon us the other three sat still at the central
control-standard directing the cylinder  its rush out
from neptune toward its moon and now that moon
grew larger ahead of us and above us a strangely-gleam-
ing sphere that seemed still very small in comparison
with the huge pale green disk of mighty neptune that
loomed behind us

  i knew though that triton was of the same approx-
imate size as earths own moon and revolved around the
great planet at the same approximate distance as earths
own moon roughly a quarter of a million miles as we
had noted from our space-flicr in flashing out toward
neptune its moon was now behind the great planet that
is on the other side of it from the sun but due to the
sharp inclination of the- plane of tritons orbit around
neptune it was so much higher than its great planet in
space as to make it possible to see the single moon even
from neptunes sunward side aud now as our eleven
the universe wreckers



cylinders shot toward it it was spreading out across
the black vault of the heavens before and above us until
at last we were within a few thousand miles of it and
the speed of the cylinder was perceptibly decreasing be-
neath the controls of the three at the central standard

  smoothly the cylinder and the ten behind it slowed
until they were racing forward at a comparatively low
velocity tritons dull-gleaming sphere filled the heavens
before us behind and a little below the great green
disk of neptune belted with the vast cloud-masses of its
immense atmosphere loomed almost as great as ever to
our eyes and far beyond it there burned the suns
bright little disk just above the huge sphere of neptune
and visible to us through the thinner vapors of neptunes
uppermost atmosphere we turned back toward the
nearer world of triton as the cylinders rushed on
toward it all the suspense of expectation and mystery
that had been ours since our first arrival at the strange
dead world of neptune gripped us now with renewed
power and as marlin and i stared ahead we were
aware that the cylinders were dropping swinging about
our pivoted seats and dropping toward the surface of
triton that seemed now to gleam beneath us

  toward it we smoothly shot and as marlin and i
gazed intently down we saw that there were below
none of the great cloud-masses that wreathed the surface
of mighty neptune instead was only a smooth and
strangely gleaming surface that we could but vaguely
glimpse and the sight of which made my beart pound
in sudden anticipation could the thing lie-could it be

that here upon triton as upon neptune- but my

wondering speculations were cut abruptly short by reality
as we shot lower toward tlie surface of triton as that
surface came clearly at last to the eyes of marlin and
myself bringing involuntary exclamations of amazement
from us for that surface was metal triton was
shielded on all sides by a giant metal roof similar to
that which enclosed great neptune itself

down toward that mighty roof our eleven cylinders
were rushing when they seemed just above it
they halted their drop and raced along above it around
tritons vastly curving surface as they did so marlin
and i gazing downward saw that the vast roof that
shielded triton appeared to be from above of the same
dark metal as that which protected neptune and that
it extended away without break or seam as far as we
could see over the big moons surface and as our
cylinders flashed above it around the worlds surface
we were aware that triton had an atmosphere even as
had its great parent world since from outside was coming
the dull roar of air against the speeding cylinder it was
a fact startling enough but at that moment it was driven
from our minds by a thing more startling still

  for as we flashed thus around tritons sunward side
marlin suddenly uttered a hoarse exclamation pointed
ahead and to the left i gazed in that direction instantly
and for a moment saw nothing unusual but then as the
cylinders flashed on i saw that in that direction was what
seemed a great round opening in the smooth dark metal
a titanic circular opening that must be miles across up
out of that opening was rising what seemed at first glance
a vast cylinder of pale light that sprang straight up and
outward from the gigantic opening and that was only
visible for a short distance above that opening fading
swiftly into invisibility as it shot out into the gulf of

space from triton instinctively my eyes followed the
fading length of that mighty beam outward and then
as they did so i felt sudden awed understanding de-
scending upon me and stared with marlin toward the
giant pit and its great ray in stunned silence for that
giant ray was pointing straight into the great gulf of
space toward the tiny fiery disk of the distant sun

  the giant force-ray marlin whispered the great
force-ray thats turning the sun ever faster-and that
we came out here to find

  and pointing straight toward the sun i exclaimed
pointing through neptunes upper atmosphere toward
the sun

  for we could see now thatthe giant ray visible only
there at its source must indeed be cleaving through the
upper limits of great neptunes atmosphere as it reached
across the great gulf toward the sun for since triton
was on the other side of neptune from the sun was
on its outward side the great green sphere of neptune
lay almost between the sun and triton the big moon being
high enough above the great planet though due to the
inclination of its orbital plane to make the sun visible
to it through the upper readies of neptunes vast atmos-
phere through that atmosphere therefore we knew
the giant force-ray must be driving on its path across
the solar system toward the sun hurtling across the gulf
to strike against that spinning suns edge with terrific
pressure and to spin it ever faster toward that day of
division and doom that wras mardiing relentlessly upon it

  but as our cylinders now swept nearer toward the
giant force-ray and the pit from which it stabbed up
and outward marlin and i were staring obliquely down
into that vast pit seen from the side as we saw it
the tremendous opening seemed only like a mighty well
of metal from which the colossal pale force-ray almost
as great in diameter as the huge pit stabbed we could
see however that set near the great pits top at regular
intervals around its curving wall were what seemed metal
cube-like rooms which were set on the pits smooth
curving wall they were a score in number those out-
jutting metal cubes and from slits in their walls came
light from within and glimpses of stud-covered walls
and neptimians moving about them we knew without
doubt that those twenty cubes held within them the
unthinkably complex controls of this mighty force-ray
that was destroying the solar system

  but now our cylinder and the ten that drove close
behind it were passing the vast pit the huge force-ray
i noted that they took extreme care to pass pit and mighty
ray at a respectable distance and knew too the reason
for it knew that any luckless cylinder that blundered into
that colossal out-stabbing ray would be driven instantly at
terrific speed and force out through the solar system and
into the sun that the ray was striking so that it did
not surprise us that the cylinders veered far to the
side of the huge ray picking up speed once more when
they had passed it and racing on around tritons metal-
shielded surface and through the cold dense atmosphere
outside it but as the cylinders drove on the eyes of mar-
lin and myself now were turned backward back toward
that gigantic pale ray of awful force that shot ceaselessly
up and out from that vast pit in tritons metal side

  weve found it-the great ray we came out here to
find-the source of that ray i exclaimed to marlin
but weve found it too late whitely and randall and
the space-flier annihilated-we captured-


amazing stories

  he bent toward me keep your courage up hunt
he said we may have a chance yet to get free-to get
away from this world of triton before they take us down
inside it

  but what- i began when with a gesture he cut
me short no more now hunt-the guards are watch-
ing but be ready to act if a chance shows itself for
once down in triton well probably have no chance

  i saw that the four disk-bodied neptunians who sat
about us and guarded us were indeed watching us closely
now with their strange bulging eyes so gave over for the
moment our whispered conversation though with a slight
gleam of hope glancing back again toward the great
force-ray that was almost invisible behind us as the
eleven cylinders raced on around tritons metal surface
i was aware that marlin was staring back toward it also
intently shaking his head a little as though puzzled by
something concerning that giant beam of force in a
moment he turned his attention ahead our cylinders
now were flashing around triton from its sunward side
to its dark side and as we rushed on marlin and i could
see that to all appearances triton was not rotating or
at least not above a low rate of speed then as we
entered into the deeper shadow of the dark side the
suns little disk vanishing behind us as we shot around
tritons curving surface into the shadow marlin uttered
a low exclamation once more and as i turned to look
in the same direction i saw that far ahead there was
stabbing out and upward into the black void of outer
space a second giant force-ray like that one we had al-
ready seen shooting toward the sun

   stupefied i gazed toward it for the first giant force-
ray amazing as it was had yet been expected by us more
or less since we had known from the first that such a
colossal force-beam was stabbing from the region of
neptune toward the sun but this second mighty force-
ray which seemed exactly the same in size and appear-
ance and which rose from a giant pit or well in the vast
metal roof even as did the first was not directed toward
the sun for it was on the other side of triton from
the first ray was exactly half around triton from the first
and was going out into space in an exactly opposite di-
rection  thus while the first colossal force-ray springing
out from tritons sunward side shot straight toward the
sun this second huge force-ray on tritons dark or outer
side was radiating straight out into the vast void of
interstellar space was radiating straight out to all ap-
pearances toward the unthinkably distant stars of sag-
ittarius that burned in that mighty void

   what could be the meaning of this other colossal force-
ray of equal size and power going out into the vast
void outside the solar system  the first great ray that
was shooting toward the sun and turning the sun ever
faster-its purpose was at least comprehensible but what
purpose could there be in sending an opposite and equal
ray out into the mighty void from tritons other side
that was the question that whirled in my astounded brain
in that moment as the eleven cylinders shot on toward
that second great ray over tritons metal surface mar-
lin though on seeing that second great ray seemed to
be less puzzled than before it seemed to have solved
for him some problem which the sight of the first huge
ray had suggested to me it was utterly incompre-
hensible and perplexed and awed i watched that huge
pale ray and the vast pit from which it sprang as we
raced toward them i saw that on that pits curving walls

there jutted forth a score of cube-like projections or
control-rooms similar to those in the pit of the first ray
then i forgot pit and rays alike as the cylinder in which
we were and all those behind it slowed suddenly in mid-
air and then dipped sharply downward

down and down they shot toward the vast gleam-
ing metal roof of great triton down until we saw
that just beneath us there was outlined in that roof a
great circle slightly sunken toward this the cylinders
dropped and then as they came to a pause just above it
i saw that set beside that circle in the roof was a trans-
parent section beneath which was a small cage-like room
brightly lit in this were a half-dozen neptunians and
as they saw the eleven cylinders dropping and pausing
above the circle in the roof they turned swiftly pressed
what seemed a series of knobs in their cage-room and
at once the great sunken circle beneath us was sliding
along beneath the roof to one side sliding smoothly away
and leaving thus beneath us a great circular opening in
the roof

  instantly up from that opening around our cylinders
was rushing a torrent of air a torrent of uprushing air
that i understod well was caused by the wanner air
beneath the roof rushing up into the colder outside at-
mosphere but now down through that opening and
through the air-currents the cylinders were swiftly drop-
ping and we could see far below in dim light a great
compartment-city like the one we had found upon
neptune in a moment more we would be below the
roof the opening closed above us prisoned hopelessly
in triton to meet whatever fate our captors decreed al-
ready two of our four guards and two of the neptunians
at the control-standard had left the cylinders upmost
section and had clambered down the ladder to the lowest
section in preparation for emerging there was left
with us in the upmost section of the cylinder only two
guards and the neptunian leader of the crimson-circle
insignia at the control standard and as i saw that i
was leaning quietly toward marlin

  nows our chance marlin i whispered tensely if
wc could overpower these three neptunians and the rest
beneath afterward we might yet get back to earth

  he glanced calmly around then nodded well take
it he whispered once beneath this roof of triton
therell be no chance

  go for the guard beside you then when i cough as
signal i told him if we can dispose of them and the
leader there we can hold the rest below for a time

  he met my eyes with his own then turned and as
though merely shifting a little in his seat moved nearer
toward the guard on his side i had already done the
same toward the disk-bodied monster beside myself both
guards having slightly relaxed their first watchfulness i
glanced out saw that even at that moment our cylinder
was sinking with the otiiers toward the great opening
in the roof and knew that no moment was to be lost so
with heart beating rapidly now even as our cylinder
prepared to sink down through the opening with the
rest i coughed slightly in the next moment i had
flung myself with a single motion upon the neptunian
guard beside me and had seen marlin in the same instant
throwing himself on the monster at his own side

  the moment following was of such swift action as to
defy the memory in my leap upon the neptunian beside
me it had been my first object to knock his tube from
the universe wreckers



his grasp before he could loose its rays upon me and so
swift and sudden was my attack that i did so as did
marlin with the other guard with the same motion
even as the guards seven great limbs reached toward me
i had grasped his big disk-body and then with a super-
human effort had raised it in my arms and had cast him
from me down through the opening in the sections floor
to crumple against the floor of one of the sections
below i whirled saw that the other guard had gripped
marlin and was bearing him down and then even as
there came from beneath and from the neptunian leader
at the controls slaccato cries of alarm i had gripped that
other guard likewise and hurled him across the cylinder
to strike with stunning force against its wall then
marlin and i were whirling toward the neptunian leader
at the control-standard but in the moment that we turned
toward him we stopped short for that neptunian had
leaped aside from the controls of the cylinder and had
swiftly drawn his own ray-tube

chapter vitt

prisoned on triton

nothing t know now of our own doing could
ever have saved us from the death that in that
moment loomed dark and close above us for
as the neptunian leader raised the tube toward us i
knew that before ever a leap could lake us across the
cylinder to him the pencil-like rays of force from his
tube would be tearing through us for that split-second
therefore escape seemed impossible and then before we
could fully realize the situation there came an interrup-
tion the currents of warmer air from the opening just
beneath down through which the cylinder had been
dropping with the others were sweeping still upward with
great force around the cylinder only the neptunians
grasp on the controls had kept the cylinder heading down
through those currents and now as he leaped away from
the controls for the moment and drew his tube those
currents immediately seized upon the unguidcd cylinder
and in the next moment had whirled it over and sidewise
with immense speed and power and as it whirled thus
over marlin and myself and the neptunian before us
were thrown instantly and indiscriminately to the cylin-
ders side

  for a moment we rolled helplesly about the whirling
cylinders interior about the upmost section and in that
moment all thought of battle had left us then as i
felt marlin and the neptunian leader and the stunned
guard rolling with me indiscriminately i was aware too
of cries from the cylinders other sections and of nep-
tunians drawing themselves up to the upmost section on
the ladder abruptly in a moment more the cylinder
steadied hung poised and upright as before and then as
marlin and i scrambled to our feet we saw that a trio
of the neptunians beneath had made their way up to
the upmost section despite the cylinders whirling by
means of lheir multiple limbs and that while one now
held the controls the other two had their tubes trained
once more full upon us

  our wild attempt at escape had failed it was evident
for now as the neptunian leader of the crimson circle
rose he was addressing to the others a sharp snapping
order and at the same time motioning marlin and me
peremptorily to the seats we had formerly occupied we

took them with no further resistance for we knew that
our desperate outbreak had put the neptunians upon their
guard and that the slightest suspicious motion on our part
might well mean instant death and as we seated our-
selves once more with the guards on either side one from
beneath replacing the one i had killed the despair that
formerly had filled us seemed immeasurably intensified
for now the cylinder was sinking down after the others
through the great opening in tritons roof and even as
marlin and i looked outward we saw the great opening
in that roof closing again above us with a clang that to
our ears was like the clang of doom

  above our sinking cylinders now there stretched the
great roof and even as neptunes enclosing roof this
one was almost entirely transparent from below though
opaque from above and here as on neptune we could
see no supporting pillars whatever for this vast spherical
roof tliat enclosed all triton this world seemed in-
deed but a smaller replica of mighty neptune for as
our cylinders sank down through the shadows of its
darker side and then leveled out and began to race
back around its curving surface toward the sunward side
once more we saw that all of tritons surface was cov-
ered even like neptune with a great compartment-city
whose intersecting black walls stretched in their vast
checkerboard arrangement over all the great moons sur-
face but as our cylinders shot over these over the
darkened portion of the surface of triton and toward the
sunward side we saw that the compartment city beneath
was different in some features from that of neptune

  for one thing there were moving to and fro above
it a number of great cylinders like that in which we
were and in the compartments of the darkened side
moved too a few neptunians here and there and the
great globes of metal that dotted this compartment-city
of triton even as that of neptune were here glowing
with radiant light glowing i knew with radiant heat
for this was the secret of the neptunians existence on
triton this heat that glowed from the numberless giant
globes set in compartments here and there those great
glowing globes kept the air beneath tritons great roof
warm and comfortable the great roof itself preventing
that warmer air from escaping into the moons colder
outer atmosphere as weshot on over the darkened
side of triton the side turned away from the sun i
could not but think that the remnants of the neptunian
race must be few indeed so few of them moved in the
shadowy compartments beneath

  at last as marlin and i gazed ahead we could make
out a brighter crescent of light at the edge of the
strange moon-world and as we shot on wc saw that we
were approaching the edge of the sunward or sunlit side
a moment more and we could see it clearly and as we
did so marlin and i gasped in utter amazement for
that part of the great compartment-city that lay on
tritons sunward side in the pale sunlight was swarm-
ing with incalculable millions upon tens of millions of
neptunians crowding seething pressing together they
were pouring to and fro through the compartments in
the pale light of day busy with the mechanisms that
scarcc had room in those compartments so great were
their crowds and over this sunward side hundreds
upon hundreds of cylinders swarmed rushing to and fro

  neptunians neptunians in countless millions here
on the sunward side of triton but why then are there
so few upon the dark side 


amazing stories

  marlin shook his head at my exclamation i cant
guess he said and i never dreamed that-

  before he could finish tlie sentence there came an
amazing interruption from beneath as we gazed down-
ward from our speeding cylinder we saw a giant band of
intensely brilliant white light spring suddenly into being
at the very line that marked where dark side and sunlit
side of triton met a mile in width that great brilliant
band of light seemed to extend clear from tritons north
pole to its south as far north and south of us as our
eyes could reach and then even as we stared astounded
at it that brilliant aud immense band of light was moving
around tritons surface over the dark side swiftly it
moved like a great wave of brilliant light sweeping
around tritons surface and in a moment had disap-
peared from view far around the horizon from us on
the dark side

  and as that dazzling light-band moved around the big
moon-worlds dark side around the almost empty com-
partment-city that covercd that dark side we saw emerg-
ing into that compartmentscity of the dark side as though
from its walls themselves millions on millions of disk-
bodied neptunians that matched in number the vast
swarms  the sunlit side and as we gazed down in
utter amazement we saw from whence they came there
were in the dark compartmcnt-citys extent many com-
partments like those we had seen upon neptune with
nothing in them save shelving which formed in their
walls myriads of shelfed openings a few feet in height
and some four feet in width one above the other and
in these narrow flat shelf-openings countless neptunians
had been sleeping their disk-bodies with the flexible
legs drawn up fitted snugly into those flat strange open-
ings in the walls and vast hordes of them countless mil-
lions of them had been sleeping in the shelf-compay-
ments on tritons dark side

  as that band of brilliant light swept swiftly across the
dark sides though they had awakened were pouring forth
in all their hordes into and through the compartments all
streaming toward the sunward side while the more remote
of them were heading toward the same side in flashing
cylinders above then as we gazed toward that sun-
ward side we saw the brilliant band of light reappearing
there moving swiftly still around tritons surface
through the pale dim light of its sunward side having
in those moments moved completely around triton it
moved on until in a moment more it had stopped where
first it had formed at the junction of the dark and sun-
ward sides there it hung for a moment dazzling and
then had suddenly snapped out of being and now we
saw that all the crowding millions of neptunians that had
been busy upon the sunlit side were streaming through
the compartments toward the dark side

  the neptunians day and night marlin exclaimed
as we gazed downward triton must keep one face
always toward the sun and one dark so these neptunians
spend their day on the sunlit side and sleep their night 
the dark side i

  and that great band of light that traveled around
triton was their signal then i added

it was plain now that that was the astounding truth
these countless millions of neptunians coming here
to triton for some reason had been accustomed upon their
own great turning planet to a day and night of ten hours
each much like those of earth triton though as we

had already guessed kept the same face always toward
the sun it was evident turning at just such a rate of
rotation as compensated for its revolutions around nep-
tune and its slower movements with neptune around the
sun thus with one face always toward the sun and the
other always in darkness the neptunians had been forced
to establish arbitrary day and night periods dividing
their millions into two great bodies apparently while
half of them worked on the sunlit side for ten hours in
their day the other half were sleeping upon the dark side
then when the ten hours ended the great band of light
went around triton as a signal and the two bodies of
them changed places the millions who had worked upon
the sunward side taking their places for an equal period
of sleep on the dark side while those who had slept 
the dark side streamed to the sunlit side for ten hours

  even as we watched from our speeding cylinder we
saw that great change taking place millions upon millions
of the neptunians streaming from one side to the other
in great throngs through the compartment-city while
from farther around tritons two sides rushed countless
cylinders in which hosts of others were changing sides
within a few minutes it seemed that change had taken
place and beneath us on tritons sunward side there
thronged in the pale light of its day tlie vast hordes that
so lately had been sleeping while on the dark side the
other masses of the neptunians had disappeared into the
countlcss shelf-like openings of the sleep-compartments
to lie in sleep for another ten hours in marveling won-
der marlin and i stared and then woke suddenly to a
realization of our own position

  beneath us there lay the very edge or dividing line
between the dark and sunlit sides a belt of twilight dusk
that was very narrow squarely across that belt we saw
there lay beneath us a great compartment that was largest
by far of all that we had yet seen and that was unique
among them in that instead of being rectangular it was
circular in shape down over and past this mighty cir-
cular compartment our cylinders were speeding and we
could but vaguely note some circular object inside it
when we were past it were speeding low over the
thronged and busy compartments of the sunward side
rapidly the speed of the cylinders decreased and then
they had paused in mid-air were beginning to descend
and in a moment more they had come smoothly to rest
in a great rectangular compartment which seemed re-
served as a landing-place since on it there rested scores
of other cylinders others constantly arriving or depart-
ing later we were tojearn that these landing-compart-
ments were scattered in large number over tritons sur-
face on the sunlit and dark sides both

  for the present moment though marlin and i were
gazing only at our immediate surroundings as we
landed the guards on either side of us gripped us tightly
the others keeping their tubes pointed toward usand then
as the throbbing of the cylinders generators ceased the
neptunian leader of the crimson circle insignia uttered
a staccato order at once our guards were thrusting us
toward the ladder that led downward and holding us
above and beneath were descending that ladder with tis
into the cylinders lowest compartment there the nep-
tunian leader followed us in a moment and as the
cylinders door was slid open a flood of warm heavy air
and a babel of sound from about us rolled inside
before emerging though the neptunians performed an
action that for the moment puzzled me completely
the universe wreckers



  this was to take from the cabinets in the cylinders
side a number of small metal objects that seemed to be
disks of gray metal a few inches across with flexible
metal straps attached to them these the neptunians
attached to the bottom or ends of their round short
limbs as though little round sandals of metal then at
the order of their leader they took other disks and at-
tached them to the feet of marlin and myself one to
each foot binding them to our soles by passing the
flexible straps up around our ankles the thing was as
puzzling to marlin as to myself for the moment nor
could we understand its object until a moment later the
neptunians began to pass out of the cylinder to the
paving of the compartment outside for as they did
so  had reached toward one of the unused disks to
examine it and had uttered an exclamation to find that
though so small in size and thickness it was of many
pounds weight yet as marlin and i in answer to the
leaders order and gesture passed out of the cylinder
to the landing-compartments floor we could not feel at
all that weight of dozens of pounds which had been fas-
tened to our feet

  abruptly though light came to my perplexed mind
triton i exclaimed its of about the same size as
earths moon and hasnt much more gravitational power
and these neptunians used to the far greater gravita-
tional power of neptune have to use these weights to
add to their weight here on triton to make it possible
for them to move as always

  marlins eyes widened and then he nodded it must
be so he said i wondered when i saw them from
above how these creatures of neptune could move so
freely on its smaller moon

  it was indeed a simple yet ingenious device which
the neptunians had adopted accustomed as they had
been to the great gravitational power of neptune seven-
teen times that of earth their squat strange bodies owing
their form to that great gravitational power their
muscles would have sent them through the air of triton
ill immense and uncontrollable leaps at each step so
much smaller was the moon-worlds gravitational power
so they bad devised these small disks which fitted to the
end of their strange limbs and which though so small
and thin yet had great weight  doubt because the
atoms of their substance had been compressed closely
together for the purpose the neptunians had used
disks of some thickness for themselves and had used
thinner ones for marlin and myself their smaller weight
just sufficing to counteract the difference in gravita-
tional power between earth and triton and now as
we stepped out into the landing-compartment with our
guards it seemed as though we were walking with lead-
weighted shoes at the oceans bottom

  the landing-compartment about us held scores of
resting cylinders like our own and even as we looked
about we saw throngs of neptunians hastening forward
and removing from our own and the other ten that
had just landed the disassembled mechanisms which they
had brought from neptune the leader however mo-
tioned to our guards to follow with us and set off quickly
across the landing-compartment toward one of its doors
following him our four tube-armed guards watchful
now about us we saw him pass through the low broad
door before us and though his strange disk-body passed
easily through that door marlin and i were forced to
stoop low to get through it then our guards never

relaxing their cautious watch over us we were moving
on through the next compartment and the next and the
next on through compartment after compartment
all thronging with neptunians moving across lhe great
compartment-city toward the twilight band that divided
tritons dark and sunlit sides

  and as marlin and i moved with our guards and
their leader thus through the pale daylight of triton
through the compartments crowded with masses upon
masses of neptunians we forgot almost the uncertain
fate that hung over us in the interest and wonder of
what we saw for though we had explored the greater
compartment-city that covered all the surface of mighty
neptune had seen its marvels also it had been a city
dead a city of lifeless and unused mechanisms whose
purposes we had not been able to guess but here on
triton in the compartments that covered its surface
we saw a neptunian city bursting with crowding life
saw it as the giant city of neptune itself must once have
been before some unguessed purpose of the neptunians
had brought them here to triton and seeing it thus
we were able to comprehend many things that had puz-
zled us in our venture through the city on neptunes
lifeless surface

we passed through compartments in which throngs
of neptunians moved about great rows of loom-
ing pear-shaped mechanisms such as we had seen on
neptune great water-making mechanisms that were
beating here with a slow rhythmic sound of pcwer and
from which there pulsed into the great connecting pipes
a ceaseless gush of water that water we knew was
made synthetically in the mechanisms by the combination
of hydrogen and oxygen atoms but whether those atoms
were derived as on neptune from the break-down of
neptunes great vapor-masses or whether they were
formed themselves from the primal electricity we could
not guess through many compartments of these we
passed and through other compartments that held great
pumps that evidently forced the water supplies thus man-
ufactured to every part of tritons surface

  and we went through compartments too in which
were other great objects lhat had puzzled us so com-
pletely on neptune but whose purpose we saw now
these were the great flat metal containers stackcd one
upon the other each a foot- or so in depth and each
filled with black green-shot soil about them as on
neptune were set in the walls great white disks con-
nected to generating apparatus of some kind but here
those generating mechanisms were humming with power
tended by many neptunians and there shot from the
disks over and through those great containers of soil
a ceaseless flood of pale violet light or force and
even as we passed through those compartments we saw
strange and stocky pale-green plants bursting up from
the soil of the containers growing at incredible speed
before our eyes attaining a height of inches in but a
minute or so as these strange pale-green plants reached
a height of a foot or so there formed upon them masses
of fruits or vegetables dead white in color some being
long and pod-like and others ball-shaped and as these
formed the attendant neptunians were swiftly turn-
ing off the violet force pulling the fruit-laden little plants
from the fine soil and depositing them in low-wheeled
containers which were wheeled instantly away then
from the framework that held the great soil-containers


amazing

stories

there sprayed out upon them fine whitish-green particles
that i recognized as seed of some sort that fell upon
the soil and then were turned under it as some reversing
mechanism turned over the soil in each container then
the violet force from the wall-disks was turned on again
and in a moment another crop of pale-green plants was
shooting up out of the containers

   it was then that i saw tlie astounding purpose of those
projectors of violet force that were set in the walls
around the soil-containers for it was evident that they
shot forth upon the containers a force or vibration which
held in it the ultra-violet and other radiations which
in sunlight stimulate the growth of plant-life these
vibrations were projected artificially through the con-
tainers of soil with immeasurably greater intensity than
in sunlight and so stimulated the growth of plant-life
in those containers immeasurably more also i could
see that tubes ran from the framework through the soil
of the containers flooding that soil with moisture and
as that water used thus came through special cubical
tanks and mixers it was apparent that it was impreg-
nated with the chemical elements needed by the plant-
life in its swift astounding growth thus stimulated
to an intense degree by those influences the plant-life
in those containers could germinate and shoot up and
ripen with unbelievable speed when it was removed
the containers were ready at once for another crop the
whole ojieration was swift and almost automatic and
as we saw great masses of the white fruits or vegetables
being wheeled away from the plant-compartments we
realized at last how the neptunians in their great com-
parunent-cities obtained a ceaseless and inexhaustible
food and watersupply

  as we passed on marveling we saw other great
mechanisms at work some were huge and cogged
operated by seated neptunians before them turning out
ceaselcss great blocks of smooth black stone-like material
that composed the intersecting compartment-walls which
poured out as a thick liquid and hardened in molds into
that diamond-hard substance others were strange-
appearing machines like none we had seen on neptune
whose purpose we could not guess here and there there
glowed in its square compartment one of the great heat-
radiating globes sending currents of intensely warm air
rushing out from about it all the mechanisms of those
globes seeming to be cased inside themselves yet even
these things were no more wonderful to us than the
throngs of neptunians that swirled and pressed in their
millions in the great compartment-city about us

  numberless indeed were the hordes of those nep-
tunians their masses swarming about us in great crowds
of disk-bodied pale-green monsters busy upon the clank-
ing beating hissing mechanisms around them busy in
providing tlie heat and food and water of their strange
world it seemed impossible almost that so many
countless millions of them could thus have crowded to-
gether on tritons surface all wore the strange armor
or dress of flexible metal around their disk-bodies some
carrying ray-tubcs slung in that armor and others vari-
ous tools or instruments here and there we saw one
with the same crimson-circle insignia as our leaders
upon his metal armor and it was apparent from the
silent deference shown these circle-marked neptunians
that they were officials of some kind as we marched
on behind our leader our guards close about us we saw
that despite our strange appearance to them the nep-

tunians paid no great attention to us-so busy were they
we saw too that here on tritons sunward side there
were no shelf-like sleep-comparfments at all all such
being upon the dark side in silent awe and wonder
marlin and i moved on through the thronging compart-
ments countless neptunians crowding busily all about
us and coundess cylinders throbbing through the aif
above with the vast roof far above them then 
sensed that we were approaching our destination

  for before us now as we crossed a last compartment
there lay that twilight band of dusk which marked the
division of tritons dark and sunlit sidess and as we
passed out of the pale dim light of the sunlit side into
the twilight of that band we saw that before us lay a
compartment wall that was curving instead of straight
the wall of the great single circular compartment we
had noticed from above the compartment that lay be-
tween us and that wall was empty save for a file of nep-
tunian guards who stood motionless along the curving
wall with their force-ray tubes ready in their grasp
as our leader reached them he halted spoke with them
for a moment in staccato speech and then as their
snapping voices ceased the guards stood aside to right
and left and permitted us to pass through the low broad
door in that curving wall through it we went our
circle-marked leader first and then marlin and i our
four guards still close about us and then as we halted
inside that door we two were gazing- with a deepened
awe and wonder about us

  we were standing just at tlie edge oi that great cir-
cular compartment that we had glimpsed from above
one hundreds of feet in diameter the twilight about it
dispelled somewhat in it by soft-glowing disks in its
walls in this great compartment there stood what
seemed an immense circular table of metal only a few
feet in height ring-like in form and with a clear circular
space at its center this great ring-tables edge was not
more than a dozen or so feet from the compartments
circular wall and ranged around it on low scats between
tlie ring-like table and tlie wall were thirty disk-bodied
neptunians silent and almost motionless they sat there
around the-great ring-table and i saw that upon the
metal armor of each was a crimson circle like that of
our leader except that there was a crimson dot at its
centcr a symbol we had noted   other neptunian
so far and from each of the thirty there ran in
toward the clear space at the ring-tables center a slender
black wire-connection attached by tliverging connections
to the body of each of the thirty

  these thirty connections ended at the space at the
ring-tables center running there into a strange object
or mechanism that stood in that space it was composed
of a great metal pedestal with straight sides like an
upright pillar into which the thirty connections ran
while upon the pillars top was supported a globe of
metal somewhat greater in diameter than the pillar being
some five feet across ill this globes side was a round
opening while set at two other points at opposite sides
of it were what seemed inset diaphragms from the
supported globe came a fine hum scarcely audible and
that was the only sound in the great compartment the
whole scenc was strange-the towering black walls of
the great circular compartment about us the great ring-
table in it and the thirty silent motionless disk-bodied
neptunians seated around that table and the giant globe
on its pedestal at tlie tables central space
the universe wreckers



as we stood there the neptunian leader before us

 spoke in sharp snaps as though explaining our
presence but not to the thirty around the table it spoke
to the great central globe of inetal in amazement we
watched him and then we saw that the globe was turn-
ing upon its pedestal turning toward us a small circle
of clear glass set in its opposite side that surveyed 
for the moment exactly like a single calm eye then
the globe turned again the opening in its side again
facing us and then from that opening came a staccato
answer to our leader a swift question apparently in the
snapping speech-sounds of the neptunians the globe
was hearing our captors report was questioning him
concerning that report while the thirty around the table
uttered no sound and turned not toward us

  good god i muttered at that astounding spectacle
that globe of metal marlin-it hears him answers
him the thing must be alive

  not alive hunt marlin said swiftly his own eyes
startled though those connections that run from the
thirty to the globe-they center in that globes mecha-
nism in some way the minds the intelligence of all the
thirty

   swift light flashed upon me at marlins words and as
i gazed astonished toward the thirty neptunians and the
central globe i knew that marlins explanation was the
only logical one these thirty neptunians it was ap-
parent were the supreme rulers the highest council
of all the neptunian race and since it was neccssary
that they use all of their differing minds as one in di-
recting the destinies of their strange race they had in
some way devised a mechanism for that purpose which
synthesized the intelligence the minds of the thirty into
one single mind by means of that strange mechanism
so that it was literally as one mind that the thirty per-
ceived and thought when gathered here together the
central globe speaking out the synthesized thoughts and
questions of all the thirty

  as marlin and i stared in amazement towrard it our
leader was answering to the globes questions concerning
us the snapping speech of the neptunian indistinguish-
able from that of the mechanism then when he had
finished the globe was speaking briefly to him again a
short order and in answer to that order the neptunian
leader turned at once toward us i think that both mar-
lin and myself would not have been surprised to meet
then the death that we knew hung over us but instead
the leader gestured to us and to our guards and led the
way out of the great circular council compartment
through a different door from that by which we had
entered as we passed through that door i glanced back
and saw the thirty neptunians of the great council still
sitting motionless and silent around their weird globe-
mechanism which was listening now to the report of
three other neptunians who had entered behind us

   once out of the great circular compartment wc found
ourselves with our guards in an irregular-shaped com-
partment filled with neptunian guards who parted to
allow s to pass through that and through another
rectangular compartment we went and then into a long
oblong compartment in which we could see despite the
twilight that reigned here were many smaller compart-
ments or divisions along the walls these were very
like cell-compartments and the low door of each of these
was closed by a black slab that slid down across it from
above before these doors there were patrolling in the

long compartment a half-dozen of neptunian guards
and after being challenged by these our own leader and
four guards marched us to one of these littfe cell-com-
partments reaching forth to grasp or touch something
on its outside wall

  as the neptunian leader did so the door of the cell-
compartment slid smoothly and silently upward leav-
ing its opening clear without ceremony then marlin
and t were motioned to pass inside and with the four
ray-tubes of the guards full upon us we had no choice
in the matter stepping inside therefore we found our-
selves in a compartment some ten feet square whose
walls like all the black walls of the compartment-city
towered for two hundred feet upward around us the
only light the square of dusky sky far above then as
marlin and i stared about us the door shot smoothly
down across the opening and we heard the soft shuf-
fling steps of the neptunian leader and our four guards
retreating outside leaving us gazing at each others
white faces in silence our great mission out to nep-
tune our great attempt to save earth and prevent the
wrecking of the solar system had come to an end at last
with our two friends gone and with marlin and myself
imprisoned here beyond all hope of escape on neptunes
peopled moon

chapter ix

before the council

 i risoned here on triton-and whitely and
rrandall dead its the end hunt-for us and
for the earth

  marlins voice was but echoing my own thoughts in
that moment and darkly i nodded the end-yes
and less than twelve weeks before that end comes be-
fore the suns rotatory speed reaches its critical point
before it divides into a double star weve found the
source of the great ray from neptune and were
helpless

  yet the world-president-the world congress-

marlin seemed to be thinking aloud they sent us out
to dare all for earth and until earth is destroyed or we
are dead we cant give up hope

  but what hope is there i asked these neptu-
nians have only reprieved us for the moment from death
for their own purposes death will be ours before long
and in the meantime who could escape from this place
 swept my arm around the cel -compartment and
marlin considered the place with me as silently and almost
as hopelessly as myself for it was truly a prison in-
escapable into which we had been thrust the square
little compartments walls were diamond-hard of that
impenetrable black stone-like substance and they towered
two hundred feet above us there were in them no win-
dows the only light that reached us being the dusky
illumination that came down to us from the compart-
ments roofless top far above that illumination was
but small indeed for the cell-compartment lay in the
same twilight band as the great council compartment
that band-of twilight lying between tritons dark and
sunward sides by it we could see however that the
black walls about us were quite vertical and smooth
and that the only break in them was that of the low
door-opening closed now by the smooth black slab
across it


amazing

stories

  it was indeed a prison from which no efforts of ours
it seemed could win us free for even were we to
escape from it wc knew we would but find ourselves in
the great compartment-city that covered all triton
thronged with the neptunians countless millions and
even that city in turn was held beneath the giant metal
roof that shielded and enclosed all triton so that never
indeed it seemed could we hope to be clear of the big
moon-world and escape back across the solar system to
earth to tell the peoples of earth from what strange
source was coming that colossal force-ray that was spin-
ning the sun on to division and doom yet despite that
marlin and i paced ceaselessly about the little cell in a
vain endeavor to formulate some plan of escape

  our first action was to remove from our feet the
heavy-weighted little disks which the neptunians had
fastened uport them and with those removed we found
that we could jump a score of feet upward in our little
cell due to the lesser gravitational power of triton
compared to that of earth sailing slowly upward and
falling as slowly yet this increased agility seemed of
no avail to us in escaping since there were no breaks in
the surface of the cells smooth towering walls by which
we might have been able to jump higher so after
some futile attempts we rested upon the cells floor
again re-attaching to our feet for convenience sake
the super-heavy little disks that increased our weight
to its normal earth-figure

  its useless marlin i said as we sat here rest-
ing after our efforts we can never get out that way-
or any other i think

  keep steady hunt he told me we cant do any-
thing now its clear but a chance will come

  it had best come soon then i said for with but
eighty-odd days left before the end i see small hope

  he did not reply to that and i think that the gloom
of utter despair that had settled upon me weighed upon
him also they were hours in which there was no
change the twilight that existed here on this band of
tritons surface never changed its dusk never light-
ened or darkened the only sounds to be heard too
were the occasional staccato voices of the half-dozen
neptunian guards outside or the answering snapping
speech-sounds of other neptunians that seemed to be
confined in cells like ourselves later wc were to learn
that despite their super-intelligence perhaps because of
it the neptunians were afflicted now and then with a
brain disorder in which it seemed that a part of their
minds mechanism would cease to function for a time
during which time they were confined in these cell-
compartinents about us save for the staccato speech
of these and the guards and the dull dim distant roar
of clanking and humming and hissing mechanisms that
came to us from tritons sunward side there was no
sound in our cell except when cylinders throbbed by
overhead

  in those hours the door of our ccll never opened and
we found that our food and water were supplied to us
inside the cell itself there were in its wall two metal
taps one of which yielded clear water that tasted flat
and chemical to us the other gave forth a thick vis-
cous white liquid which we recognized after a time as
a liquefied preparation of the white vegetables and fruits
we had seen grown so rapidly this preparation or
liquid was apparently pumped through the compartment-
city like the water thus there was no need for the

guards to enter our cell it was a number of hours later
that there came an interruption to the monotony of
eventlessness of our time which roused us somewhat
from the gloomy apathy of spirit into which we had
fallen

  without warning there sprang into being all about
us an intensely brilliant flood of pure white light that
bathed all things about us in its blinding glare for the
moment and then swiftly moved away toward the dark
side of triton we were stupefied by its appearance
thus and then remembered suddenly the great band of
brilliant light that we had seen appear and move swiftly
completely arotuid triton marking the end of a ten-
hour period and the signal for the sleeping millions of
neptunians on tritons dark side and the busy millions
on its sunward side to change places upon this strange
world surely enough in a few moments the brilliant
band of light had swept upon us from the sunward side
having traveled completely around triton and dwelling
for a moment again upon us had snapped out of being
that great brilliant band of light as we were to learn
was produced by great projectors at tritons two poles
and whirled around it by the turning of those project-
ors now as its brilliant signal swept around the big
moon-world we could hear the countless hordes of the
neptunians shifting from dark side to sunward and
from sunlit side to dark while overhead there throbbed
and shot this way and that innumerable cylinders

  swiftly as before that great change was accomplished
and then as there began again the dull clamor of activity
upon the sunward side marlin and i turned from our
listening attention but at that moment we heard a
staccato rattle of speech outside our door and an instant
later the great black slab of that door slid sharply up-
ward and three neptunians moved inside the cell the
foremost one of these bore on the metal armor of his
great green disk-body a crimson circle that marked him
as one of the neptunian officials the other two were
apparently guards brought in as a precautionary meas-
ure their force-ray tubes unsheathed and leveled un-
hesitatingly upon us the neptunian official carried in
his grasp a small octagonal object or mechanism with
a simple button-control which we gazed at curiously
he touched the button-control of it and there sounded
from it a series of swift sharp snaps of sound exactly
like those of the neptunians staccato speech then
speaking aloud himself he motioned from himself to us
and then to the mechanism

  it was marlin who first understood his purpose the
neptunian language he exclaimed this one has
come to teach it to us to make it possible for them to
communicate with us

  but the mechanism i said what is its purpose

arlin stared at it a moment then reached forth
and touched its round button-control bringing
from the mechanism an irregular succession of snaps of
sound its for us he said suddenly they know
that with our different bodies we cant make the sharp
snapping sounds that are their speech so have brought
this mechanism to us to serve us as an artificial voice

  the neptunian official as though he had understood
us motioned again to the mechanism and then from
himself to us at the same time uttering a few speech-
sounds as though in explanation it was plain indeed
that his object was to teach us the strange neptunian
the universe wreckers



speech pointing to himself and to the two guards he
uttered a succession of five sound-snaps irregularly
spaced over and over again until it was evident that
they represented the name of the neptunian races then
marlin and i attempted with the little speaking mecha-
nism to reproduce those five snaps of sound and after
experimenting for a time with the mechanisms button-
control we succeeded that done the neptunian pointed
to us and uttered another short succession of sounds
another word which we then learned to utter on the
mechanism also

  thus for hour upon hour the neptunian continued
with us teaching us word after word in their strange
staccato language that language we found seemed
very much like a communication code of dots and
dashes all its sounds or sound-snaps being of the same
pitch there being no raising or lowering of the voice
while for each word there was a certain combination of
the sharp sounds quickly too after a time we began
to understand and learn that strange language and
though never could our own vocal apparatus have pro-
duced the clacking bursts of sharp sound which were
their speecli-sounds we learned to manipulate easily the
little mechanism that spoke to them for us hour fol-
lowed hour and day followed day until we became so
proficient in the knowledge and expression of their words
as to be able to communicate effectively though halt-
ingly with the great disk-bodied neptunian who was
teaching us

  yet we found that that ability served us nothing for
though we plied the neptunian with innumerable ques-
tions concerning the great mysteries that we had come
through and that lay about us he would answer nothing
what great chain of events had it been that had made
of mighty neptunes colossal compartment-city a silent
desert of death and that had sent all the neptunians
crowding upon triton what was their purpose in
directing their mighty force-ray toward the sun turning
the sun ever faster to accomplish its division into a
double star why too had they sent a second great
force-ray out in an opposite direction from the first
passing out into the vast void of interstellar space  these
questions we put many times to the great neptunian who
taught us but the big grcen-bodied disk-monster sim-
ply contemplated us as though unhearingly with his bulg-
ing glassy eyes and went on with the teaching of their
strange speech

  so days followed days while we slowly progressed in
our learning of the neptunian speech days in which the
despair that had gathered in our hearts grew darker and
darker for at last when more than a score of earth-
days had passed we realized that all was hopeless in-
deed that even had we chanced to escape even had we
still our space-flier that had been destroyed with whitely
and randall we would hardly have time enough to re-
turn from neptune to earth and bring back the fleet of
space-fliers that were being prepared on earth not
much more than a half-hundred days indeed remained
before that last day that would sec the sun splitting at
last to engulf almost all its planets for with each day
we knew the giant force-ray of the neptunians emanat-
ing from triton was turning the sun faster and faster

  twice indeed i almost made a wild attempt to over-
come our neptunian teacher and guards but was held
back by marlin who knew as well as i that instant death
only could result from such an attempt and as those

days passed as with each ten hours the great band of
light went around triton and the millions of neptunians
on dark and sunward sides interchanged i came to look
on death as a release from the agony of suspense and
torture in which we were i think that not much longer
could either marlin or i have endured the terrible torture
of that imprisonment when there came at last a break
to it on the twenty-second day of our captivity

  on that day as we waited in the unchanging twilight
for the coming of our neptunian teacher and his two
guards we were astonished when the door slid up to
find facing us outside a different neptunian official of
the same insignia of the crimson circle with four guards
behind him instead of two he did not speak to us but
motioned us silently to move outside and as we did so
he gestured to marlin to take with us the small speech-
mechanism by which we were able to converse with the
neptunians then guarded closely before and behind
our attempted escape in the cylinder having kept the
neptunians extremely watchful of us ever since we were
marched out of the long oblong compartment of the cells
and across others toward the great circular council com-
partment into it we were marched and found that
as before there sat around the great ring-table the thirty
silent members of the council the great metal globe still
on its pedestal at their center they did not turn toward
us as we entered and halted beside them but the great
globe did turning first the single gleaming eye upon us
by means of which we knew all the massed minds of
the thirty members of the council were receiving a visual
impression of us

  then the globe turned swiftly so that its speech-
opening faced us and it spoke to us spoke as the assem-
bled minds of the thirty with all emotions removed and
with all thoughts synthesized by its mechanism you
are the two creatures captured upon our world  it asked
and you have been taught our language as we or-
dered 

  marlin pressed the button of the little mechanism in
his grasp speaking back in the same snapping speech-
sounds by means of it we are those two he said
simply

  the globe was silent a moment then spoke on the
thirty whose minds spoke through it never turning
when you two were captured upon our great world
others no doubt like you were discovered in a space-
vehicle which it was apparent was operated by the same
principle of forcc-rays which we of neptune it was
their own word-equivalent for the name of the planet
have long used in our own space-vehicles and in other
ways that vehicle and those inside it it has been re-
ported to us were destroyed by those who discovered it
but we desire to know from whence it and you two name
and in what way you were able to reproduce the force-
rays which we of neptune have long used from the
structure of your bodies it is apparent that you come
from a small planet in all probability the second or third
of the suns worlds but from which and why have
you come here

  marlin did not answer for some moments then spoke
back through the little mechanism he held it is from
the suns third world indeed that we have come he
said and we have come here have plunged out
through the void to this the suns outermost world to
find out why you of neptune are loosing doom on the
solar system with that great force-ray of yours that

spins the sun ever faster and to use all our power to
halt that doom

in that tense moment a thrill of irrepressible pride shot
through me even in the dark peril in which we stood
at marlins words for they were not his alone they
were the words of earth the words of earth and all its
races to neptune and all its hordes  and at that bold
defiance flung- across the void from world to world and
issuing here from marlin in the very face of this su-
preme council of the neptunian rulers of this great
globe-mechanism that held their gathered synthesized
minds for the time being an order to the guards behind
us for our instant death would not have surprised me
yet here again we were given proof of the difference
between the mind-workings of the neptunians and our-
selves it was evident that the human passions of hate
and anger held small place in their cold machine-like
minds for the great globe that spoke for the minds of
the assembled thirty was silent for a time and when it
did speak it seemed not to regard the passion of mar-
lins words

  when you speak of halting the doom that confronts
our world it said it is apparent that you do not know
the necessity of that doom the great necessity which
has caused our races of neptunians under the direction
of the council of thirty to loose that doom upon the
solar system learn now therefore that it is to save
our own world our own races that we are loosing this
death upon the suns other worlds and peoples

  the great globe again was silent for a moment the
thirty members of the council silent around it as their
assembled minds poured their thoughts into its mecha-
nism to be released in a single voice marlin and i
stood there at the great ring-tablcs edge and surely no
stranger scene could have been imagined than that with
the great circular compartments towering black walls
around us the twilight that reigned above and around
the thirty silent dislc-bodied neptunians and our own
disk-bodied guards and the great enigmatic globe-
mechanism hefore us that spoke and listened as a living
thing representing the massed minds of the thirty and
now that great globe was speaking to us again in the
staccato neptunian speech

  it is most wise perhaps it said that you two of
another world learn now what colossal forces and neces-
sities lie behind the loosing of that great doom which
you come to strive vainly against it is most wise that
you learn now how useless it is for you or any of your
world to oppose yourselves to the plans of us nep-
tunians for wc of neptune arc of an ancient power
and might beside which you of the inner planets arc
as newcome children and lest you doubt that power
lest you doubt the colossal forces that we of neptune
have called into being and use for our own purposes
we of the council tell you now what mighty past is ours

  oldest of all the eight worlds of this solar system
indeed is our world of neptune this you must know
indeed if your scientists know aught of the formation
of the suns planets for those eight planets were
formed unthinkable eons ago out of the fiery sun itself
up to that time the sun had moved through space en-
tirely without planets one of the countless stars of this
galaxy of stars all moving through the void in differing
directions one of these other stars chanced to be mov-
ing in the general direction of our own star our own

sun and their mutual attraction for each other drew
them closer together until at last they passed each other
closely perhaps even touched each other their nearness
to each other causing by gravitational attraction huge
masses of the flaming gaseous substance of each to break
loose thus the space between the two passing suns
was filled with those great flaming masses and as they
separated each by its gravitational power drew a share
of those fiery masses with it on its path through the
void

  thus when the two suns receded from each other
once more each carried with it a rough half of the fiery
masses that had been torn from each as tlie sun
moved on through space with these fiery masses about
it the greater part of them dropped back into the sun
the flaming masses that remained however had ijeen
thrown by the cataclysm into a swift motion which by
the suns attraction had been converted in the ease of
each flaming mass into a circular or elliptical orbit around
the sun and since the speed of each flaming mass just
balanced with its centrifugal force the pull of the sun
inward they continued in those orbits for age on age
without perceptible change the solar system then had
become stable

  thus the sun was moving on through space with
eight great flaming masses of matter revolving around
it in addition to a number of great clouds or aggrega-
tions of smaller fragments these eight flaming masses
became in time the suns eight worlds a solid crust
forming first on one and then on another of them the
outermost of these great fiery masses was that which
in time was to become the planet neptune it had been
one of the first of the great fragments of the two suns
torn loose by their encounter and being one of the first
had been hurled out to a greater distance than any of
the others and being the first too it had had more
time to cool ils solid crust had formed earlier on it
and thus neptune was in fact the oldest of the suns
planets to form as a solid-surfaced world neptune
too is composed of much lighter materials than the
denser inner planets and the reason for that is that it
was the lighter matter of the two suns that had naturally
been sent flying forth from them in their encounter
and thus the outer planets the four great outer worlds
being of the suns lighter matter are all much less in
density than the four smaller inner worlds which were
thrown forth lalcr from the suns heavier matter and
thus in smaller masses

  so out of tlie great irregular-shaped outermost
mass of flaming gases had been formed the great planet
neptune and its smaller moon of triton and as nep-
tunes surface solidified as the great masses of water-
vapor and air that made up its dense and immense atmos-
phere ensheathed it it became a habitable world one
fit for life and the continuation of life for though
small heat came to distant neptune across the great void
of almost three billion miles that separated it from the
sun the sun giving it indeed a heat hardly perceptible
yet there was heat enough for the great world in its own
fiery interior for so great in size was neptune that
though a solid crust had formed upon it there still lay
beneath that crust the vast raging fires of its interior
and those fires heat was so great that they kept the
surface of neptune and the dense atmosphere above that
surface warmed constantly and triton had an atmos-
phere also and interior warming fires
the universe wreckers



  thus great neptune though farthest of all planets
from the sun became habitable the earliest of all and
since wherever a world is found on which life is pos-
sible life sooner or later will arise so it arose on nep-
tune race upon race of living creatures rose upon it
and race after race vanished annihilated by changing
conditions on its surface which they could not withstand
it was not until we disk-bodied neptunians evolved
upon the great worlds surface indeed that there came
a permanent form of life upon it for we whose disk-
lodies owed their squat flat shapes to the gravitational
power of neptune so much greater than that of your
inner worlds had in larger measure that spark of intel-
ligence which the other creatures had lacked and with
that gleam of ruiud of intelligence wc were able to
withstand the changing conditions on neptunes surface
by adapting ourselves to those conditions growing ever
in numbers and spreading out over our worlds surface
until at last we swarmed in millions uponjt and were
rising into greater and greater comprehension of the uni-
verse about us into greater and greater intelligence and
power

reat buildings we built upon neptunes surface
and deep we tunnelled below its surface also
through breaks in the great cloud-sereen about our
world we looked forth and saw with our instruments
the other planets that moved about our sun and looked
forth also into space and saw the hosts of other suns
that moved at vast distances from our own our eyes
were accustomed to the dim neptunian day our bodies
to its great gravitational power and it was our home-
world yet by this time so vast had become our num-
bers that millions of us were crowded too closely together
and desired to migrate to triton our moon and settle
there and though we had never yet been able to sally
forth from the surface of our own great world of nep-
tune we found the way to do so then

  that way was given to us by the discovery by our
scientists of a new force-vibration one that lay in wave-
length between the light vibrations and the higher elec-
trical vibrations this force-vibration they found
exerted a definite pressure or force upon any object
struck by its waves just as the light-rays themselves
exert a definite though far smaller pressure upon what-
ever matter they strike with this new force-ray there-
fore we planned to propel vehicles through space and
we constructed great cylindrical vehicles which were
to hurtle out into space by generating inside them a great
force-ray which would be shot back against a world
and thus propel them by repulsion away from that world
these cylinders were made and tested and since they
worked perfectly we constructed many of them enough
to take out all the millions of our surplus population
to triton and so in those cylinders those millions of
neptunians went hurtling out to triton

  they found as our observations had shown us that
triton had a good atmosphere and that it was swarming
already with many forms of life some of them unutter-
ably grotesque and none of more than the lowest in-
telligence using weapons of concentrated force-rays
which clove through all they touched our millions of
neptunians proceeded to annihilate all life ujxm triton
and with that accomplished proceeded to build for them-
selves structures and cities like those on neptune they
found that triton was a perfectly habitable world for

them save for two considerations one of these was
the lesser gravitational power of it which made it ex-
tremely inconvenient for them to move on it with their
neptunian muscles they solved this problem by at-
taching to their limbs small and unobtrusive disks of an
extremely heavy metal which we could make by the
artificial massing of atom-prolons without electrons
these disks increased their weight to such a point that
they could move as freely and conveniently on triton as
on neptune

  the other problem facing them on triton was the
fact that it turned one face always toward the sun its
rotation  its axis indeed was of just enough speed to
counteract its revolution around neptune and neptunes
own revolution around the sun the sum total of its
movements resulting in this keeping of one side always
toward the sun with that side always palely lit by the
sun and the other always in darkness even when triton
was behind neptune invisible perhaps from your own
world by reason oi the edge of neptunes great atmos-
phere projecting up to hide it somewhat tritons orbit
was so slanted or inclined toward the plane of the solar
system that the sun was always in sight of its sunward
side though dimmed a little when the edge of neptunes
atmosphere was between them the neptunians who
had gone to triton were accustomed to neptunes
alternating day and night of approximately ten hours
each and so they solved the problem by living upon the
sunlit side of triton for ten hours for a day and then
passing to the dark side for ten hours of night

  thus they had conquered all die inconveniences that
had faced them in settling upon triton and so upon
triton as upon neptune were neptunians and their
cities the civilization of both neptune-and its circling
moon seemed secure and unchangeable indeed a civiliza-
tion that existed upon our world and its moon when
all the other planets of the solar system held only the
lowest forms of life if life they held at all easily
could we of neptune have ventured into the suns other
worlds had we wished in our space-cylinders but we
had no desire to do so having learned all that wc wanted
of those worlds by observation with our instruments
and being content to remain safe upon our great world
of neptune and smaller moon-world of triton and
safe we remained there for ages yet during all those
ages there was coming closer toward us a great crisis
which we had long before foreseen yet which we had
considered so remote a peril as to give it  attention

  but now that peril had become close and great and
it was none other than the extinction of all life on both
neptune and triton that faced us due to their steady
cooling for all worlds however fiery their interior
cool in time and die and steadily surely the interior
fires of both neptune and its moon had been cooling and
the substance solidifying already they had cooled so
far that the surface oi neptune was much colder than
ever before and that of triton also and with each pass-
ing century that cold was increasing it would be a
matter of time only it was plain before both neptune
and its moon would lie utterly without life a terrible
frigidity reigning upon each all life perished from them
in that bitter cold for though worlds nearer the sun
might exist by means of the suns heat though life on
them could cling to existence through the suns warmth
neptune and its moon were so unthinkably distant from
the sun that almost no heat reached them from it and


amazing

stories

as their interior fires cooled they must inevitably become
so cold as to annihilate all life upon them

  it was evident that some great plan must be adopted
that would prevent this condition and such a plan was
quickly dccidcd upon this plan was to enclose both
neptune and triton with great roofs of metal that would
hold in them the heat that was being radiated out and
that would make it possible to aid the failing heat of the
two worlds by artificial means it would be a gigantic
task to place those great roofs about neptune and tri-
ton but we set to work upon it and for years upon years
all the energies of the neptunians were centered upon
the construction of those roofs we had established
vast workshops in which the plates of metal that were
to form the great roofs were turned ceaselessly forth
and these in turn were joined together to make the great
roof of giant neptune

  it had been decided that that great roof that was
to enclose neptune would have no supports whatever
for that roof was to be in effect a gigantic spherical
shell enclosing neptune and as such it would float in
space around neptune without touching it at any spot
since the attraction of neptune upon the roof would be
the same in all parts thus it would not be pulled to this
side or that and would not touch the great planet in any
place the small attraction of the sun and the other
heavenly bodies on the free-floating spherical enclosure
was nullified by an automatic force-ray pressing against
the inside of the roof in the right direction and thus the
giant spherical shell could enclose neptune and could
float about it moving with it through space without
touching it at any point

  the metal plates that had been joined together to
make the vast spherical shell were of a strength to resist
all stresses and they had been specially treated by a
crystallizing process that gave them a unique property
this was the property of admitting all heat and light
vibrations from above through them but repelling those
from below thus when the great roof was in place
around neptune enclosing it completely the suns light
and heat penetrated down to it through the roof without
check making the roof seem transparent from below
rut no light or heat vibrations could pass up through
the roof from beneath so that it appeared quite opaque
from above thus what light and heat the sun furnished
were not lost and neptunes day not darkened but
very little of that heat of neptune itself could be radiated
outward into space

  with the great roof in place around neptune and
with openings that could be opened and closed at will
provided in it for entrance to or exit from neptune
a similar roof though far smaller was constructed
around the smaller globe of triton with those great
enclosures thus shielding neptune and triton there-
fore their cooling was slowed and it seemed to all that
the expedient of the great roofs had warded off the men-
acing cold that had threatened to extinguish all life on
neptune and triton strange new cities were built on
neptune and triton great compartment-cities that
needed not roofs with the great roof above them new
methods were found of producing vast food supplies
for the crowding millions of neptunians by stimulating
with electrical force and chemicals the growth of vegeta-
tion to an unthinkably swift rate thus we neptunians
in our giant enclosed world of neptune and in our en-
closed moon triton had checked the colossal peril that

had threatened us and could continue to live safely upon
neptune and its moon for age upon passing age

chapter x

to split the sun

e had checked the great peril that had hung
over us but we found as the centuries and
ages passed that we had only checked it that
we had not banished it for nothing in the universe
could halt the cooling of neptune and triton as their
interior fires cooled colder and colder grew their sur-
faces despite the roofs that enclosed them it was then
that we had recourse to another means of halting that
oncoming cold-the use of artificial heat we set up
in the giant compartment-city of neptune and in that
of triton also great globes that radiated out unceasing
and intense heat these globes held inside them their
own mechanisms mechanisms that could change etheric
vibrations of electricity and light and others into hcat-
vibrations by changing their wavelength and with
these radiating their ceaseless heat and with the great
enclosing roofs the oncoming cold was again checked

  yet after a time we were forced to recognize that
this check also was but temporary for we were fighting
the most grim and hopeless battle in the universe we
were fighting against the relentless and inevitable changes
caused by the immutable physical laws of the universe
so that aid its failing heat as we might with artificial
heat-producers the interior heat of neptune was waning
still and more and more globe heat-radiators were re-
quired to keep the temperature of neptune at its usual
height the neptunians of triton were faced with the
same problem but their situation was not so desperate
as of those upon neptune since though triton had
cooled as quickly its enclosed space was so much smaller
than neptunes its great roof so close to it also that
it was possible with an effort to keep enough heat-mech-
anisms going there to maintain the warmth

  on neptune however the struggle became more and
more desperate our great struggle against the blind laws
of nature for as neptunes interior heat declined
farther and farther it became more and more impossible
for us to keep enough heat-mechanisms going to keep
it warm enough for life and at last after years upon
years of that awful struggle against fate wc of neptune
realized at last that it was no longer possible to keep
neptune warm enough for us to exist there and that we
must leave it at once for some other world if we were
to escape extinction since as the great planets interior
heat declined it became more and more agonizing for
us to keep enough heat for life by means of the heat-
mechanisms and it was clear to all that the end was at
hand unless we left neptune

  but where could we go even if one of the other
planets were suitable to receive us we could not have
transported all our masses from neptune to another
planet in time to escapc the doom of cold and death that
was closing down upon neptune to transport all those
masses would have required countless trips with our
limited number of cylinders and to take refuge upon
another planet even had lime been ours was almost
out of the question for long our scientists had studied
the other planets with their instruments and though
some of them were so cloud-wreathed and others so dis-
the universe wreckers



tant as to make observation difficult it had long been
known to us that none of the other planets due to their
natural conditions or to the presence of intelligent alien
beings already upon them would be possible as a world
for us neptunians it was for those reasons indeed
that  expeditions of cylinders had ever been sent to the
other planets

  there remained then but one place where we might
go hut one place to which our millions might go before
neptunes cold grew too great for life that place was
triton our peopled moon for peopled as that moon
was with its own masses of neptunians struggling
against the same menacing cold that had vanquished us
on neptune it was the one refuge for our peoples by
crowding into its every comer the countless millions
of neptunes peoples would be able to exist upon triton
aud though the cooling of triton had menaced it with
cold also it has been found as we have mentioned that
it was not so hard to keep triton warm by means of the
artificial globular heat-mcchanisms the space enclosed by
its great spherical roof being much smaller it was a
desperate expedient truly to mass all the thronging mil-
lions from the compartment-city that covered all giant
neptune to mass all those millions upon little triton
yet that was the one expedient open and so it was fol-
lowed at once

  out from neptune to triton went all the cylinders
of both worlds loaded with as many neptunians as they
could carry depositing those neptunians upon triton
and racing back for more countless trips made those
thousands of cylinders trip after swift trip each occupy-
ing hut little time because triton was so near and so
at last there came a day when the whole of neptunes
millions had been transported out to tritoil when there
remained on neptune itself no single one of our races
out giant world lying cold and deserted and dead 
longer a habitable world its vast compartment-city empty
of the millions that had for ages swarmed through it
while all those millions were crowded now upon little
t riton

  and so crowded were those vast hordes of the nep-
tunian races that for a time it seemed that they could
not exist in such numbers upon triton this crowd-
ing was made less acute however by an expedient now
adopted by us as mentioned the neptunians who had
settled upon triton long before had found that the un-
changing day on one side of it and the unchanging night
on the other were inconvenient for them after the alter-
nations of neptunes day and night and so had begun
tlie custom of spending a day of ten hours upon the sun-
lit side of triton and a night of equal length upon the
dark side aud now we found that we could make
the crowding of our races upon triton less acute by
having half of them working and active upon the sun-
ward side for ten hours while the other half slept
through their night on the dark side every ten hours
these two halves of our people changed sides changed
from day to night a signal having been devised to mark
the hour for that change a signal which consisted of a
brilliant band of intense light that passed swiftly around
hoth tritons dark and sunward sides with this shift-
ing of our peoples each ten hours it was possible to make
use of all of tritons surface and thus the crowding of
our peoples upon it was made less acute

  yet that crowding was still very great all the
thronging neptunians that had existed upon the surface

of giant neptune had been poured out on little triton
far far less in size than its great parent-world aud
thus though they could exist upon it it was existence
only that was possible to the neptunians  triton since
this awful crowding would grow worse we knew rather
than better and also and more important here on
triton the same deadly menace that had driven us from
neptune was again confronting us for even as nep-
tune had coolcd triton had cooled was cooling also
and though we strained every effort to keep the warmth
in triton constant though we sent cylinders constantly
back to dead and deserted neptune to bring from it more
heat-mechanisms and other needed mechanisms we
found that even as  neptune we were fighting a losing
battle with nature for triton was cooling was cooling
still farther and soon would be completely cold and
dead its interior heat gone out into space and when
that happened  number of heat-mechanisms could keep
warmth upon it even beneath the great enclosing roof
and all life on it must perish

  the neptunian races had come to their last stand
crowded upon our refuge of triton striving with all
our power to keep upon it the warmth without which
we could not live we saw at last that some new and
radically different plan must be found or we could no
longer exist so all the greatest of our neptunian scien-
tists were called together by us the council of thirty
into a great conclave here  triton they were called and
to them without equivocation of any sort and to the races
of the neptunians tlie situation that confronted us was
stated we had been driven from neptune by the relent-
less growing cold and now that same cold was upon
us here at triton was threatening us here also with
annihilation how were we to meet this great menace
that threatened to wipe us out

ountless were tlie plans that were advanced
in answer to that menace by our scientists the
first and most obvious plan was migration to another
planet but here we were checked by the same consid-
erations that had made us unwilling to try that before
for we knew by observation of the other planets that
upon none of them could we live as we lived upon
neptune some of them were greater in size than
neptune with greater gravitational power and that was
a difficulty that could not be overcome by us since upon
those planets our weight would be so increased as to
make us helpless even had those planets been fit for our
life some planets were peopled by intelligent and
powerful races which we might be able to conquer after
terrible struggles others were too near the sun for us
to ever inhabit them who had evolved on the dim cool
world of neptune die outermost world other planets
as far as we could tell were quite uninhabitable mer-
cury venus earth mars jupiter saturn uranus-
not one of them was suitable as a world for us nep-
tunians and we had also no desire to move to another
planet in truth since so many ages had it taken for us
to build our great compartment-cities upon neptune and
triton to shield them with their great roofs that it was
impossible for us to leave them even had we been able
to start anew upon another world

  we must remain with our own great world it was
plain but how then could we continue to live in-
numerable were the suggestions that were advanced hut
even those who advanced them were forced to admit


amazing

stories

them impracticable scores upon scores of useless plans
were submitted to us but none held even a shadow of
hope for us and it was not until we of the council
of thirty had come to despair almost of warding off the
doom that threatened us that a plan was finally ad-
vanced by which that doom could indeed be halted

  that plan put forth by three of our neptunian sci-
entists in cooperation was one of such colossal nature
that even we neptunians who had roofed our worlds and
had fought for so long the forces of nature were stupe-
fied by it these tlirce neptunian scientists in stating
their plan stated first that it was apparent to all that
no escape to other planets was possible for us and
that our races must remain at neptune and its moon for
life or death they stated that it was equally clear that
no means could be found by which even triton could be
kept heated artificially all such means suggested requir-
ing such vast expenditures of energy as to make them
impossible for any but the shortest period of time these
premises they said were clear indeed and it was equally
clear that unless a new source of heat were found in some
way for neptune and its moon we races of neptunians
must swiftly die and so these three suggested a source
of heat that never even had occurred to any of the rest
of us suggested-the sun

  the sun as a source of heat for us the idea seemed
incrcdible to us-the council of thirty for to us of
neptune lying so far out in space from the sun that
sun could never mean and had never meant what it does
to you of the inner planets to you it is a source of
ceaseless blazing heat of brilliant light warming your
worlds sometimes to scorching no doubt but to us
that sun has seemed always but a tiny little disk of fire
far off in the void from us a little sun-disk that gives
to us the dim light of our pale neptunian day but that
gives to us hardly any measurable heat whatever we
had simply never thought of the sun at all as a source
of heat any more than you would think of a star as a
source of heat since we had been accustomed always to
rely upon the interior heat of neptune for our existence
but now with that interior heat gone with neptune cold
and dead beneath the zero temperatures that reigned
there and with triton fast approaching the same condi-
tion these three neptunian scientists advanced the sun
as a possible source of heat that might save us

  the sun they admitted was loo infinitely far from
us to help us any with its heat as conditions were but
what they asked if the sun were to divide into a double
or multiple star countless stars of the universe we
knew had done so had split into a double or triple or
multiple star and in so dividing by reason of their rotary
speed or centrifugal force growing so great as to make
it impossible for them to hold together the two or more
small suns forming out of one always moved some
distance apart from each other by the first force of their
division if the sun were to divide into a double star
therefore the two smaller suns that would be formed
thus would undoubtedly follow the same course would
be pushed apart from each other by the very force of
their division some two billion miles our astronomers
had calculated

  pushed apart thus the two new suns would form an
ordinary double star or binary the two revolving around
each other and by their division almost all the planets
of the solar system would without doubt be engulfed in
one or the other of the two suns the four inner planets

would inevitably be annihilated when the sun split into
two suns when those two rushed apart from each other
for if they were not directly in the path of the two
separating suns they would be drawn into those separat-
ing suns almost at once by the tremendous gravitational
disturbances attendant upon this tremendous cataclysm
they would have no more chance of life indeed than
midges in a great blaze and in the same way jupiter
and saturn would be whirled out of their orbits since
those orbits would be fatally confused and changed by
the first division of the sun and by the loss of centrifugal
force attendant upon their confused slowing they too
would without doubt be drawn into the path of one
or the other of the separating suns and perish in them
and even uranus would meet a doom as inevitable since
with a distance of two billion miles between them the
two new suns would be resting almost exactly upon
uranus orbit and so that world too would go to blazing
death in one or the other of them

  but neptune would not i for neptune farther out
than uranus farthest out of all the planets would be
the one planet in the solar system that would escape the
tremendous cataclysm due to its distance from the sun
when the two suns separated neptunes orbit would
probably change a little it would probably sweep closer
in toward those suns for some distance but except for
that it would be unchanged and would by reason of its
great distance continue to circle in its curving path
through space but would circle then around these two
new suns instead of around the former single sun and
with those two suns separated as they were by a distance
of two billion miles neptune would be near always to
one of those suns because it would undoubtedly sweep
nearer to them when the cataclysm occurred and would
take up an elliptical orbit about them with the two suns
as the foci of that ellipse thus it would always be near
enough one of them to gain from it or from both a
large amount of heat for not only would neptune in
its elliptical orbit be far far closer to them thus but
the other planets hurtling into them would tend to make
them hotter thus neptune revolving close about the
two suns would gain from them the warm life-giving
heat that it had never gained from the single sun

  that heat would thus solve the great problem that
faced us it would halt the doom that was closing down
on us for that heat would so warm neptiine that we
could go back again and take up our existence once more
upon it free from all peril could live again in that great
compartment-city that covered all neptune and triton
too would be livable then for the great roofs that we
had erected around neptune and its moon would tend
to make of both worlds great hot-houses in effect the
suns or suns heat being able to penetrate down through
those roofs and with those enclosing roofs about us
and with the two new suns close we could live on in
safety for the enclosing roofs themselves would pre-
vent any inconvenience from the fact that neptune now
and then would be farther from the two suns than at
other times those great roofs keeping a constant warmth
upon neptune and its moon

  thus all the great peril that confronted us would be
thrust back and we could live once more on neptune
more warm and comfortable there than ever before we
could pour back once more to our mighty world that lay
now dead and cold and deserted-could do all this if the
sun did divide into a double star yet what hope was
the universe wreckers



thejg that this could happen we knew that the reason
tffher suns of the universe divide into double or multiple
stars is because they have reachcd a rate of rotatory
speed that makes it impossible for them longer to hold
together for when a sun is spinning its mass tends to
split up by its own centrifugal force just as a turning
wheel and the faster the sun spins the greater grows its
centrifugal force the greater its tendency to split and
then at last that rate of spin grows so great and its
centrifugal force is such that its mass can no longer hold
together and fission takes place the sun dividing into
two or three or even more stars that push apart from
each other but what chance was there of the sun doing
this  for the sun we knew rotated at the speed of one
turn in  days at its equator and to split it would have
to be rotating at a speed of one turn in an hour that
meant that it would be unthinkable eons before the suns
rotatory speed would have increased to that point for
though a suns rotatory speed does increase as time
passes due to the shrinkage of its mass it increases so
infinitely slowly that it would be eons indeed before the
suns rate of spin would be so great as to cause its
division and thus there seemed small hope indeed in
that plan

hen it was that those scientists revealed to us

  jl the heart of their plan and made clear to us the
true colossal nature of their suggestion what they
asked if we ourselves increase the suns rotatory speed 
what if we of neptune should reach across the void
of almost three billion miles and set the sun to spinning
faster spinning it ever faster and faster until it had
readied the critical point until it turned once in one
hour fission would result then the sun would divide
into a double star as they had calculated and all the
benefits mentioned would come to us and neptune and
its moon would be warmed always by the heat of the
two suns about which they would revolve if we could
do that if we could reach across the void and set the
sun to spinning ever faster it would soon divide into
two new suns and thus we would have saved ourselves
yet we were thunderstruck by this suggestion of the
neptunian sdentists to reach out across the infinite
leagues of space that lay between our outermost planet
and the sun to turn that sun ever faster until it split
into a double star-how ever could such a gigantic stupe-
fying feat as that be accomplished

  but the neptunians who had suggested this plan now
calmly explained how that colossal deed could be accom-
plished long before indeed we had discovered force-
vibrations finding them a vibration that exerted tangible
and definite pressure or force upon whatever matter they
struck and we had used those force-rays in some ways
we had used them to propel our cylindrical vehicles out
through space from neptune to triton and vice versa
we had used them also concentrated into slender penril-
like rays of great power as weapons since those con-
centrated rays penetrated and destroyed all that they
touched now our scientists proposed to use them for
this huge plan-to reach across the void across the solar
system and to turn the sun ever faster until the desired
division of it had happened

   nor was this as they outlined it impracticable the
sun turning there in space at the center of the solar
system has naturally one edge or limb turning away
from us and the other turning toward us now if we

constructed colossal generators of the force-vibrations
generators that could produce a gigantic ray that would
have almost inconceivable power and shot that ray across
the solar system toward the edge of the sun turning
away from us what would happen it was dear that
that great ray striking against the side of the suns
mass turning away from us striking that side with titanic
pressure and force would tend to turn that side faster
away from us would tend in that way to make the whole
sun turn faster such a gigantic ray though it would
increase the suns spin thus but slowly would continue to
increase the suns spin steadily as long as it was kept
turned upon the suns side slowly but steadily the sun
would turn ever faster until soon it would have reached
that critical rotatory speed of one turn in one hour that
would make its centrifugal force so great as to make it
divide into a double star and so save us of neptune from
the cold death that hung over us

  thus this mighty plan was presented to us and it
was at once accepted by us of the council of thirty by
all of the neptunian races for we saw that in it lay our
one chance for life our one chance to halt the doom of
our races our worlds and to halt that doom we were
willing to make any effort we knew that the other
planets of the solar system that the seven other worlds
of this universe and all their moons would go to flaming
death when our plan succeeded would be annihilated
when the sun divided but we recked not of that for
the last necessity was upon us the last closing down
of the doom that we had fought against so long and to
remove the shadow of that doom from over us we were
willing to send to a more terrible doom all the other
planets of the solar system

  only one great difficulty lay before us that gigantic
ray could be generated and shot forth by us since it
would hot be difficult by concentrating all efforts to
construct the generators and mechanisms needed but
from what place was that ray to be shot toward the
sun and how it was evident that the giant ray
could not be sent from neptunes surface for not
only would it be almost impossible to keep its great
mechanism working in the constant terrible cold that
reigned there but neptunes rotation would make it
impossible to send the ray forth from any spot on the
great planet since because of neptunes rotation it would
follow that that spot-that great ray would be toward
the sun half the time on neptunes sunward side and
the other half would have turned and point away into
space from its dark or outer side it was apparent
therefore that the great ray could not be sent forth from
neptune since to achieve its effect that ray must play
constantly upon the suns one side or edge and it became
apparent that only from triton could it be sent forth
since triton kept one facc always toward the sun and
it would therefore be necessary only to set the great rays
mechanisms in that sunward side when it would point 
unchangingly toward it

  as far as position was involved therefore it was
quite feasible to drive the colossal force-ray out from
tritons sunward side toward the sun but there was
another point involved one that bid fair to ruin the
whole great plan when this gigantic force-ray reached
out across the gulf and struck the sun it would push the
suns side with inconceivable power as was planned with
a power great enough to turn that suns titanic mass
faster it would be in effect like a solid arm reaching

forth from triton to press against the suns edge but
the sun is gigantic is millions of times greater in mass
than triton and so what would he the result of that
great pressure of the ray  it would without doubt
turn the huge mass of the sun with that pressure very
slowly but it would by that pressure and by its reaction
push back against the infinitely smaller mass of triton
itself and push it amvy from the sun it would push it
back away from the sun with such colossal power that
triton would be torn loose from the grip of neptune
its parent-world would be torn loose almost instantly
from the solar system itself and would be hurtled
straight out into the awful void of interstellar space away
from the sun and all its planetary worlds

  it was the same principle indeed as that of our
cylindrical space-fliers those cylinders generating in-
side themselves a powerful force-ray shot that force-
ray down against the planet upon which they were but
that force-ray striking with great pressure from the com-
paratively tiny cylinder to the great planet did not move
the planet of course with its push it moved instead the
cylinder itself hurtling it upward from the planet because
its mass was so infinitely smaller than the planets and
it would be the same way with triton and the sun for
triton sending forth the great force-ray generated upon
it toward the turning suns edge pressing against the
suns huge mass with colossal power would not move
the sun would not turn it noticeably faster as we planned
but would move triton itself out from the solar system
into the void of space  almost instantly by that terrific
push triton would be hurled out into the awful gulf
of space and thus by that terrific push outward would be
torn loose from the attraction of the sun and its planets
forever and would by its own inertia shoot out through
the interstellar void for all time and that meant of
course death for all the massed neptunian races upon
triton since in the sunless awful void of space outside
our universe our solar system they would at once
perish

  this seemed indeed the difficulty which was to
make our great plan impossible but with only that
obstacle standing between us and success we did not
despair but sought to overcome it and at last we
found a remedy for this difficulty found a means by
which it might be overcome triton would he pushed
out into the gulf of space away from the solar system
forever when its great force-ray struck the suns edge
but what it was asked if triton were braced against the
push outward of that great raj were braced by a great
force-ray of equal colossal power shooting out from it
in an opposite direction against some great mass tending
in that way to push triton inward toward the sun even
as the great raj striking the sun would tend to push
it outward the result would be obviously that triton
would be pushed on either side by the two opposing great
force-rays with equal power and being so pushed be-
tween them it would not move either inward or outward
and thus being immovable being braced against the
pressure of the ray shot toward the sun by the pressure
of the ray shot out into the void against as great a
mass tritons ray striking the suns edge would as we
desired turn that sun faster and faster spin its huge
mass faster without affecting triton itself for the
two great rays being so exactly balanced in power triton
would not be affected in the least in its own positions or
motions

  there was needed then only a second great force-
ray to go out into space opposite in direction to that
of the first it meant however that since tlie first was
radiating straight toward the sun from tritons sunward
side the second must radiate straight away from the
sun from tritons dark side which would make the
second ray point out into the void toward the constella-
tion in which it would be in reference to the sun that
is we calculated that by the lime all would be ready for
us to send the force-ray in toward the sun the constella-
tion sagittarius would be straight out from neptune and
the sun  then the second ray would need to be sent out
toward sagittarius for it would be then against one
of the great stars of sagittarius that this second opposing
force-ray would strike to brace triton against the other
ray striking the sun the star calculated ixjst for that
purpose being the bright star in the quadrilateral of
sagittarius it was apparent therefore that when the
great force-ray was shot toward the sun the second or
bracing ray should be shot out against that bright star in
sagittarius to brace triton against the first rays push

ret in reality the problem was not as simple as

  i that for that star in sagittarius we well knew
lay like all the stars infinitely farther from us than the
sun it would require but a little more than four hours
for the first great force-ray which travels as you know
almost as fast as light itself to reach the sun but it
would require a number of years for the second great
force-ray traveling at the same speed to reach the bright
star in sagittarius and strike against it for even the
nearest of the stars of course lies so far from our
solar system our universe that it requires years for light
to cross that colossal distance in consequence it would
require as long or longer for the second force-ray to
cross such a great distance traveling as it would at a
speed almost that of light thus since that bright star
in sagittarius that had been fixed upon lay dozens of
light-years from our solar system it would require
dozens of years for that second great force-ray to reach
that star

  it was evident therefore that tlie second force-ray
would need to be shot out toward that star long before
the first since it was vitally necessary that the two rays
strike their objects at the same moment

  the first thing to do therefore was to prepare the
great generators and send that second ray out toward
sagittarius that work was begun at once for only a
short time was left us on tritons dark side beneath
the great roof countless great generators were con-
structed giant generators of the force-vibrations which
could by their massed power produce a colossal ray of
unthinkable power then a great pit or giant well was
sunk in the roof one whose sides sank down from the
roof toward the surface of triton at the bottom of
that great pit on tritons surface was set the mighty
mechanism or ray-concentrator that would send the gath-
ered power of all the massed generators driving out into
the great void in one colossal ray that mechanism was
of course upon tritons surface and was cut off from
the rest of that surface by the metal walls that rose
around it to the roof since in that way it was possible
to send the great ray out from tritons surface through
an opening in the great roof the enclosing walls or sides
of the pit preventing the warm air beneath tlie roof from
escaping outward and keeping it air-tight as ever
the universe wreckers



  with that much done the controls of the colossal
ray and its generators were then constructed those
controls were not single but were repeated no less than
twenty times there being a score of control-boxes for
the great ray set around the walls of the huge pit from
which the ray would spring forth and entered not from
without but from within those walls of course a
single control-box would have been enough but our
object in having a score of control boxes was clear
enough it was a matter of life or death for all the nep-
tunian races that those controls should function properly
if this great second force-ray ceased but for a moment
to go toward the star in sagittarius as mentioned the
backward pressure of the other great force-ray pressing
against the sun would hurl triton out of the solar system
for all time with all the neptunians upon it so those
controls were not entrusted to a single control-box but
were duplicated in twenty so that if any one control-
box was destroyed or harmed in any way or even if a
half-score or more were so destroyed or harmed the
great ray would continue to go forth

  with that done with the great generators ready the
ray-mechanism or opening ready and the control-boxes
and their intricate controls all completed the first step
was finished and there remained but to turn on the
giant ray to send it forth to that bright star in sagit-
tarius so on the day that had been designated the
neptunians to whom had been entrusted the all-important
watch of the twenty controls took their places in the
control-boxes the great ray-mechanism had been so
placed in tritons dark side of course that it pointed
directly toward that star which the ray was to strike
and so it was needed only to turn on the giant ray and
so at last with all the neptunians gathered there be-
neath the roof around the walls of the giant pit staring
through those walls transparent from within we gave
the word then as one the twenty controls were
opened and from the gathered throbbing generators
from the great ray-mechanism at the huge pits bottom
there drove upward and outward into the great void of
space the colossal force-ray visible only near its source
as pale light flashing out at almost the speed of light it-
self on its stupendous journey across the void toward
that bright star in sagittarius that was its goal

  there was no push against triton of course when
that colossal ray went forth for there could be no push
against triton until that ray struck a solid body struck
the star that was its goal and then it would push back
against triton just as if you reach forth to push your-
self away from a wall there is no push on your body
until your hand reaches the wall not until dozens of
years had passed we knew would that great ray strike
the star in sagittarius that was its goal and not until
then would come the back-push against triton the brac-
ing back-piish that was its purpose and in those dozens
of years with the great ray shot ceaselessly forth to that
star of course neptune and triton themselves would be
moving somewhat would be moving as neptune followed
its slow orbit around the sun but so slow and so vast
is neptunes orbit-movement that it would have moved
but little and as it moved the ray-mechanism would be
turned constantly a very little so that its great ray would
still be directed ceaselessly toward the star in sagittarius
and so that when that ray struck that star neptune and
triton would be just between or in line with the sun
and that distant star

  thus half of our great task was finished and there
remained but to complete the other half to make ready
for the sending forth of the other great force-ray the
first one as we called it toward the sun in the years
that followed while the great force-ray traveled cease-
lessly on and on through the great void toward that
distant star that was its goal we neptunians were busy
here upon triton with the making ready of the newer
force-ray on tritons sunward side directly opposite
to the other force-rays source we constructed again
the great generators that would be used for this newer
ray massing them there beneath the great roof with
those generators finished we began again to construct
a great pit or well in the roof and to place at its bottom
the ray-mechanism that would send this newer force-
ray in through the solar system toward the sun

  terrible years were those for us though now at last
this terrible time approaches its end for in those years
we had not only to keep on the immense task of con-
structing generators and mechanisms for the newer
force-ray and to keep operating the other great genera-
tors and mechanisms that were sending forth ceaselessly
the great forcc-ray toward sagittarius we had also to
fight against the ever-encroaching cold thatwas deepen-
ing ever its dread menace over us and that seemed on
the point of overcoming us even as we reached the climax
of our giant fight against doom for ever that cold on
triton grew greater as it grew still cooler at its heart
and ever we must make greater and greater efforts to
keep operating the innumerable heat-mechanisms that
alone held death back from us yet we spurred ourselves
onward by the thought that now at last we were ap-
proaching victory over this dread menace of cold that
had beset us for so long for at last the dozens of years
required were drawing to an end and the great force-ray
was fast nearing the star in sagittarius that was its
goal

qo we labored on with all our strength and soon the
kj mechanisms of the new giant force-ray were fin-
ished its great pit ready in tritons sunward side and
the twenty control-boxes set in that pits walls now
at last was approaching the crucial moment of our great
plan that moment in which all must be calculated and
performed with infinite care lest we meet disaster the
greatest of our scientists had many times in those years
calculated the exact moment when the huge force-ray
we had shot forth would meet at last the star in sagit-
tarius would strike against that star it was necessary
that the other giant force-ray that we were to send forth
against the sun would strike the suns edge at the same
moment exactly as the other ray struck that star and
with the same power exactly so all was anxiety un-
utterable as wre approached this great climax of our
plan

  by this time scores of your earth-davs ago neptune
in following its orbit had moved so that it was almost
exactly between the sun and that distant star in sagit-
tarius toward which the ray was shooting the fact
that triton revolved about neptune did not impede that
ray of course since as you know triton moves about
neptune in an orbit slanted greatly inclined greatly from
the ecliptic and so even when on the outer side of nep-
tune its ray would be able to go straight toward the sun
through the upper limits of neptunes atmosphere and
so in the same way even when it was on the sunward


amazing stories

ide of neptune its great ray that we had sent forth
years before could shoot directly toward the star in
sagittarius the only thing needful was that the ray
we sent forth toward the sun be of the same power and
strike it exactly when the other ray struck that distant
star go that they would push hack against triton with
the same force at the same time

  so in tense anxiety we remained and at last there came
the moment for which we waited more than four hours
before the time wheu we calculated the other ray would
strike the star in sagittarius and when that moment
came the signal was given and the new mighty force-ray
was shot forth from tritons sunward side shot forth
toward that edge of the sun turning away from us
that ray of course had no planets directly between it
and the sun we having chosen long before a time for
the whole plan when this would not happen but hi the
four hours and more that followed we millions of
neptunians waited here on triton with suspense un-
utterable the moment was approaching when this giant
force-ray would strike the sun if we had calculated
wrongly if the other giant ray did not strike that star
in sagittarius at the same moment triton would be
hurled out to doom in the great void by the sun-rays
pressure tensely we waited and then at last there came
the moment for which we had waited that moment
came and passed-that moment in which the new giant
ray struck the sun-yet triton did not move beneath its
pressure

  wc knew that we had won for the other ray had
struck the star in sagittarius at the same moment balanc-
ing triton against the pressure of the sun-ray and now
as we observed the sun we saw by our instruments that
it was turning faster already its huge mass was spin-
ning faster as our great ray stabbed from triton to press
against that mass edge with colossal force within the
first earlh-day the pressure of that great ray against the
suns edge had increased the suns speed of spin at almost
the exact amount we had calculated had decreased its
rotatory period by four hours and each day thereafter
the steady pressure of that colossal force-ray has turned
the sun ever faster at the same steady rate has de-
creased its rotatory period by four earth-hours more
so that even as we had calculated we saw within iso
earth-days from the first sending forth of the sun-ray
that the sun would be spinning so fast beneath that rays
pressure its rolary period decreased to the critical
period oi one hour that it would no longer be able to
hold together and would divide into a double star

  and even now that great plan which we the nep-
tunians and we the council of thirty carried out
comes at last to its fruition for already more than
one-half of that time more than eighty days have passed
and there remains hardly more than thrcc-score days be-
fore the great sun-cataclysm comes hardly more than
three-score days from now the end for all your inner
planets far all the planets save neptune will come the
sun reaching that critical rotatory period of one hour and
spinning then so fast beneath the pressure of our great
ray that it cannot longer hold together will divide into
two suns that will whirl apart from each other and en-
gulf in their fires all the planets save our own outer-
most one sending them with all their peoples to fiery
doom for to that doom we neptunians are sending
them to save ourselves from a doom in another way
equally as terrible

desperate chances

  as the great globes voice ceased for a moment that
strange staccato voice to which for many min-
utes marlin and i had listened i found my brain
whirling with the things we had just heard for a
moment i glanced around as though to assure myself
of the reality of what was about me of what had just
been told us the great globe the thirty silent nep-
tunians of the council around it -the other disk-bodied
neptunians who guarded us-these with the towering
black walls and strange twilight about us only deepened
the strange trance of horror in which i had listened
and now the great globe was speaking again

  thus it is clear to you how unalterable is the doom
that we are loosing upon the suns other planets ujmn
your own planet to save our own nothing now can
save your world and the other worlds of the sun from
annihilation and it is to make that dear to you that we
of the council have told you this much of what we have
done nothing can save your world from death yet you
two of that world shall escape that death with us nep-
tunians for it is evident that your race and you must
have considerable scientific knowledge to enable you to
imitate our great force-ray and use it to venture out
here to neptune so that though lesser than our own
great ancient race in science and knowledge it may well
be that you have certain knowledge which would be
new and useful to us for that reason you have been
saved and have been taught our neptunian tongue from
now on our scientists will question you and whatever
of new knowledge you are able to give to us you shall
give you have heard from us how hopeless it is to
think more of your own doomed world and you know
of course how entirely in our power you are therefore
think well when you are taken bade to your cell upon
what you have learned here since it is only for the sake
of what little our knowledge might gain from you that
you two have been preserved from the death

  the great globe was silent and before we could reply
to it could gather even our whirling thoughts the
neptunians guarding us had dosed about us again point-
ing to the door through which we had come as hi a
daze marlin and t were led through that door the great
globe turning and following us with its single vision
eye as we went out  think that neither marlin nor i
came to complete realization of our surroundings until
we had been thrust once more into our little cell for
it was only then staring toward me as though half-
unseeingly that marlin repeated slowly the great globe-
mechanisms last words

  the death that in days will overtake our world  and
the neptunians are loosing that death on our world and
all the suns other worlds to save their own races
and that is the explanation of all i exclaimed
the great ray that turns the sun faster the other
ray shooting out toward the stars the dead and deserted
surface of neptune the crowded surface of triton-
god marlin if we could only get back to earth with
what we know

  we must get back he cried even if we escaped
we two could not turn off that great sun-ray could not
wreck all its twenty controls but if we could only get
back to earth and lead back here the fleet of space-fliers

to grasp him

that the world
president planned to

  its hopeless

marlin i said

weve thought of
a thousand ways of
escape in the days
that weve been here
and not one has even
the wildest chance of
success

  hopeless indeed it
seemed to marlin
and me as wc sat
there silent in the
dusky little cel for
the colossal epie of
neptunes past and
mighty plan which we
had heard there from
the council of
thirty from their
globe - mechanism
that centralized their
minds had implanted
in us a profound
despair we had
found at last the ex-
planation o f all this
vast enigmatic thing
that was wrecking

our universe but had found in that very explanation
new depths of hopelessness earth was doomed
the solar system as such was loomed we saw
it now beyond all doubt we who alone of earths
races knew whence that doom was coming and i think
that neither marlin nor i sitting silent there in the dusk
of our cell gave any thought to the terrible fate that
hung over us two who had been kept alive as we now
knew for whatever possible knowledge wc might be able
to impart to the neptunians we forgot our own fate
of a living death amid the neptunians in our agonized
contemplation of the great deepening shadow of doom
that was darkening the sun and all its universe

  it seemed to me as we sat there that it was centuries
rather than weeks sjnce marlin had given to earth his
first warning of that doom his first news of the suns
increased spin all that we had come through since
that time seemed the events of countless years the
great meeting of the world-congress and its adoption
of the plan of marlin and whitely the building of the
space-flier and that start by night of marlin and randall
and whitely and myself in it our hurtling flight out
from earth on our great mission past mars and through
the dangers of the asteroidal belt past mighty jupiter and
on winning through the peril that almost annihilated us
at saturn to our goal neptune our amazement at find-
ing that world roofed and enclosed the venture of marlin

and myself down into its dead and deserted compart-
ment-city the attack of the neptunians the pursuit and
destruction somewhere out in the mists of neptune of
our two friends of whitely and randall in the space-
flier and our own capturc our own journey to tritons
swarming strange world and our days imprisonment
and now at last this titanic tale of the past and purpose
of neptunes races which had been told us by the great
globe of the council it seemed incredible indeed that
all of these things cpuld have been so compressed into
the time of a few-seore days as they had been

  yet they had been i knew and knew too that the
sixty-odd days that remained to us before the end came
before the sun spinning ever faster beneath the pressure

of the giant ray from triton split at last into a double
star that these three-score days would seem centuries on
centuries of agonizing torment for us two who must
wait imprisoned here for the doom that was closing
down upon the solar system to come to its dread climax
and at that thought at the thought of that helpless
inaction that must he ours a blind unreasoning revolt
arose in me as in marlin and like him i sprang to my
feet paced the little cells length with clenched hands
all was unchanged about us the towering black walls
around us the half-heard staccato voices of the nep-
tunian guards outside the dim roar of sound that came
to us through the twilight from tritons swarming sun-
ward side the very changclessness of the things about
us pressed upon my spirits with such suffocating force
in that moment that i was almost on the point of beat-
ing blindly against the cells door when recalled to
myself by the suddenly tense tones of marlins voice
beside me

  hunt he exclaimed there is a chance to get
out i think ive been thinking and il we can make
a great enough effort i think that we can win clear of this
cell at least

  i ghook my head its no use marlin i said
weve gone over it all a thousand times-theres no
way out but through the door and that never opens but
with a half-dozen neptunian guards standing with ray-
tubes outside it	-	-

  but there is another way he persisted out the
cells top hunt out the roofless top

  we tried it i told him and it was useless even
with tlie lesser gravitation here on triton even without
these weights on our feet we could only jump a score
or more feet straight upward and the walls are two
hundred feet high and utterly smooth and vertical
but one way we didnt try he insisted and as i
listened with dull lack of interest he went on to outline
to me his idea and as i listened my indifference sud-
denly vanished for i saw that marlins keen inventive
brain had really found a plan that would give us a
chance of escape its our one hope he finished and
if we can use it to get out of this cell well have a chance
to steal one of these cylinders of the neptunians and get
back to earth in it in time

  well try it at once then i said excited now at
this faint gleam of hope for the changing-hour for
the neptunians on the dark and sunward sides conies
soon and we dont know how soon those neptunian
scientists who are to question us will be coming here

we prepared for the attempt at once our first
and main preparation was to unbind once more
from our feet the little and great-weighted disks of
metal which increased our weight against tritons lesser
gravitation to its normal earth-figure with those disks
removed our lightest step sent us a few feet into the
air so greatly were tlie results of our muscular efforts
increased then since with my somewhat greater
strength t was to be the first to try marlins plan i
stepped or rather floated toward the couiparlmciit-cchs
side witii a single step crouching down there with my
body braced against the wall behind me from that
position the square little opening of the cell two hun-
dred feet above seemed infinitely distant yet i did not
despair drawing a long breath and then with all the
force of my musclcs leaping obliquely upward upward

and slantwise thus  went with tite force of that leap
for more than a score of feet toward the opposite wall
that much higher from the floor seeming to float smooth-
ly up-so much slower than on earth was my progress
through the air

   and as i shot smoothly toward the opposite wall i was
twisting myself in mid-air so that when i struck that
wall more than a score of feet above the floor it was
my feet that struck it and as they struck it bent with
my impact against the wall i abruptly straightened them
again shot suddenly away from that wall again on an
upward slant again toward the other wall again as i
floated upward i was twisting in mid-air to strike that
wall feet-foremost and again as  struck it i was kicking
against it with my legs so that hardly had i touched it
than i was shooting back across the cell again toward
tlie opposite wall but again on an upward slant gaining
a score of feet on each strange leap i made thus across
the cell thus in zig-zag leaps from wall to wall i was
progressing up the narrow cell toward its roofless top
far above it was just tlie same as when on earth a
man in a wide chimney can work himself up from bottom
to top of it by bracing himself now against one wall and
now against another and the fact that the cell was
much wider could only be touched wall at a time
was counterbalanced by the fact of tritons far lesser
gravitational power which alone w hiaking it possible
for me to continue my strange progress upward   

  on triton alone indeed or on a world of similar
size and gravitational power was such a feat possible
for only thus could one leap with such new impetus each
time from wall to wall and twist in midair to strike braced
for another leap and as i leapt up in that criss-cross
fashion from wall to wall my heart beating rapidly put-
ting all my strength into each great leap i could see
marlin on the cells floor below gazing up tensely through
the dusk knew what depended upon our escape and so
struggled upward with a superhuman strength up-up
-back and across-across and back-in leap after slant-
ing leap upward i progressed until with a half-dozen
more leaps the cells open top lay close above me by
then though the energy which i had summoned for this
superhuman feat seemed fast waning and as i shot from
wall to wall i realized that t was gaining less and less
toward the top with each leap

  another leap-another-and as i shot back across the
cells width from wall to wall i was aware of the walls
top but a few yards above me yet felt at the same time
the exhaustion that had gained upon me now almost near
to overcoming me another leap-with agonized mus-
cles i propelled myself back to the opposite wall with
the top of that wall but a few leet above me one more
up-slanting leap would take me back up and across to
the opposite walls top i knew but in that tortured
moment i felt that i could never make it and knew that
if i missed it i must inevitably fall downward so as i
struck that wall feet-foremost i put the last of my
strength into a great effort and shot floatingly across
tlie cells width for the last time and this time with
hands outstretched i struck the top edge of that opposite
wall fumbled with it for an agonizing moment and then
had grasped it and had drawn myself up on the thick
walls top

  for a moment i lay across its top oblivious to all
else in the exhaustion that possessed me inhaling and
exhaling great panting breaths then as i drew myself
the universe wreckers



up a little i peered about me far away on all sides of
me stretched the walls of the compartment-city that
covered all of triton those walls tops intersecting like
a great checkerboard and all level with the thick walls
top on which i lay twilight lay over a broad band of
that compartment-city about me the twilight band be-
tween the dark and sunward sides the brighter day of
the sunward side stretching away to one side humming
with activity and with many cylinders moving to and fro
above it while to the other side stretched the silent
sleeping dark side beneath its unchanging night now i
gazed down through the dusk toward the cells floor far
beneath and saw marlin gazing up toward me anxiously
gestured silently to him and in a moment more he was
coming up toward me by the same great zig-zag leaps
from wall to wall that i bad used

  in anxious suspense i watched him as he came grad-
ually up toward me shooting from side to side oi the
cell in upward-slanting leaps that brought him each many
feet upward gradually though i saw that the force of 
his leaps was lessening his upward progress slowing as
he too began to feel the waning of his strength i knew
that older than myself as he was those leaps were telling
against marlin even more than they had done against me
and in utmost suspense i watched as he came more and
more slowly toward me at last he was but a score or
more feet beneath his face tense and strained as he shot
from wall to wall gaining now but a few feet each leap
with clenched fingers i watched him powerless to help
saw him by a last gathering of his strength making an-
other up-slanting leap and another and another until
but one more was needed to reach up to the wall on
which i crouched and even as marlin made that last
leap even as he shot across the cells width and up
toward the wall on which i crouched i realized with a
thrill of horror that he had leaped short 

  in that moment as marlin shot across the cells width
toward me with hands outstretched i saw his white
strained face and knew that even as i did he realized

end of

 the shortness of the leap that he had made with his last
 strength realized that his outstretched hands would miss
 the walls lop by feet thai moment in which he shot
 across the cell as his own hands struck the smooth wall of
 length yet as he shot toward me it was more by instinct
 than by conscious thought that i acted swiftly hook-
 ing my knees over the walls top upon which i crouched

 i	hung with head and body downward into the cell
 reached downward with hands open and as marlin shot
 across the cell as his own hands struck the smooth wall
 of it many feet below the top i reached and grasped them
 tightly a moment thus we hung there he held by my own
 down-swinging body and then holding his own hand by
 one of mine i reached upward wilh the other drew
 myself slowly and with an infinite effort upward in
 another moment i had drawn myself and marlin on to
 the walls top and there crouched with him again in a
 silence of exhaustion for the moment only his and
 my own lessened weight on triton had made it possible
 for me thus to save him

   for but a moment we crouched there ihen raised our-
 selves and looked quickly around us cylinders were
 moving to and fro from time to time over the com-
 partments of the twilight band from the sunward side
 and we knew that if we remained upon the walls top
 long we would inevitably be discovered we must de-
 scend into one of the compartments as swiftly as possible
 but into which one in an endeavor to solve the ques-
 tion we began to crawl quietly along the top of the
 wall gazing down upon its other side as we did so the
 compartment on that other side was a cell like our own
 and it was empty but its only egress was into the hall
 between the ccll-rows and that was guarded by the nep-
 tunian armed guards to descend into it or into any
 of the other compartment-cells was useless so along the
 walls top we crawled through the dusk until in a
 moment or so more we found ourselves looking down
 into one of the irregular-shaped ante-rooms to the great
 circular compartment of the council of thirty

i am an interested reader of amazing stories
and enjoy them very much you may wonder
why i am writing this to you the reason is i
would like to find out something and i thought
that you could give me the necessary information

what i would like to know is the figures on the
speed of light and sound and bow these are
tested

if you cant give me this information could
you tell me where i could get a book dealing
with these subjects and astronomy

i -would e very much obliged to you if you
could forward this information and it would
settle a dispute between my friends and myself

the velocity of sound is determined as follows

let a cannon be fired at a point distant a known
amount from the observer as it is fired a flare
of lights is produced visible to the observer who
with a timing apparatus obtains the time between
the flash and the sound of the explosion as light
practically takes an infinitely short time to
over any terrestrial distance the time determined
pivc the speed of sound for light cnc method fol-
lows light from a narrow slit is allowed to fall
upon a mirror to be reflected to another distant
mirror which reflects it back to the first inirrur
and thus back to the source this first mirror i-
not stationary however bnt is made to revolve
rapidly so that when the wavesreturn from the
distant mirror the angles of incidence and re-
flection are not quite what they were before and
so the waves are not reflected directly hack to the
slit source but are dehected slightly if the
amount of this deflection the distance apart of the
two mirrors and the rate of revolution of the
rotating mirror are kllowu the velocity of the
waves may be calculated the encyclopaedia and

     shades of the nth man
the gladiator by philip wylie pub-
lished by alfred a knopf new york
 

atahe gladiator is a book which
i starts well is quite readable and en-
- tertaining throughout but is after
all disappointing it is based on the fact
that insects such as ants and grasshoppers
are veritable giants of strength comparing
their size to that of man the father of
the hero one abednezo duma a bio-chem-
ist succeeds in finding and isolating a
strength-producing matter and succeeds
in producing tadpoles capable of  shatter-
ing the glass walls of the aquarium and
in producing a super-cat which at the age
of seven weeks opens doors by tearing
them to splinters kills its mother by a
playful pawshake and later on kills full-
grown cows

  it seems that the serum or whatever
you call it operates only through the
mother and anxious to produce a human
being with prodigious strength abednezo
inoculates his wife tlie experiment is a
success the child a boy is a marvel
at the age of one week he is able to lift
himself back to a chair by the use of one
hand his helpless and pious mother starts
a campaign of repression and the child
hugo by name as he gets older is usually
afraid of using his gift of super-human
strength as he grows up his inferiority
complex grows with him true enough
he has been given plenty of brawn but
not enough brain to overcome what seems
to him a handicap a prodigious awe-
inspiring strength this tragedy keeps on
increasing he quits college because he
accidently kills a boy during a football
game he goes a-sailing saves the lives
of several people to atone as it were for
the accidental murder does some deep sea
diving finds a lot of pearls he opens the
oysters right on the spot since he can
stay under water longer than anybody
else and lands in marseilles just as the
world war is declared he naturally helps
to make the world safe for democracy
and proceeds to clean up the german antiy
singfehanded lie is invulnerable sharp
bayonets just glance off his skin nor can
machine gun bullets puncture it only leav-
ing red spots his ability to jump forty
feet and to run with the speed of an ex-
press train provides his trench with am-
munition food and drink all of which he
hauls in bundles weighing over two tons
his pal shayne is blown to bits by a
german shell which infuriates him so that

he invades a german trench and kills hun-
dreds of enemies barehanded by just
crushing them it is most modestly stated
later on in the hook that hugos mighty
deed induced the germans to give up in
disgust and sign the armistice the father
of his pal shayne visits him in france
and is intrusted with hugos modest for-
tune which through the older shaynes
loving care grows to a million with
the end of the war hugo returns to
america but his inferiority complex rides
him so hard that he cedes all his money
to his parents and goes to work as a com-
mon laborer in a shell foundry hereas
everywhere his strength creates hatred and
mistrust he is forced to quit and hires
out as a farmhand a nice little love
affair with the farmers wife turns sour
when he kills the attacking prize bull with
a blow of his fist a telegram summons
him west to the bedside of his father who
before his death reveals to him the secret
of his being in the shape of notebooks
containing his case-history hugo then
goes to washington enters politics and
wrecks the house of an obstreperous lob-
byist but even he is not strong enough to
clean out the augean stable of corrupt
politics and goes to new york there he
starts to work as a clerk in a bank his
strength is again his undoing becausc by
saving the life oi a fellow-worker he tears
a vault to pieces with his bare hands and
thereby in the eyes of the bank president
becomes a menace to all banks he is ar-
rested and third-decreed by the police
what he does to minions of the law is
amusing he then accompanies an explorer
to yucatan saves the life of the man by
holding lifting and throwing a block of
stone weighing many tons and is finally
induced by the explorer to reveal the secret
of his strength the explorer a scientist
of high degree waxes enthusiastic and out-
lines to hugo the possibility of creating a
large number of super-humans such as
he based on his fathers experiments in
order to uplift the world in general hugo
wanders off into the jungle and is utterly
destroyed notebooks  and all by a stroke
of lightning which is a rather sad fafe
just as he had found someone who had
completely understood him and had found
for him a place in the scheme of things and
shown him where and how to be useful
he dies

  in spite of the obvious shortcomings of
this hook it is quite enjoyable and will not
be forgotten as quickly as the average
best seller-c a brandt

       the world below
the world bclozv by s fowler wright
published by long mam green  co
new york  

the first part of this book was pub-
lished under the title the amphibi-
ans by the merton press of london in
 and the present volume is virtually
a reprint of the earlier edition with the
addition of a second part consisting of 
chapters in his previous books the
deluge and dawn mr wright gave us
his version of how modern man would re-
act if another deluge should happen in his
book the island of captain sparrow
he has pictured the adventures of a modern
couple among people reverted to sav-
agery and has shown the possession of
a splendid imagination but unfortunately
has the same tendency toward wordiness
as his countryman herbert george wells
has furthermore where wells is clear
and given to satisfactory explanations
wright is abstruse and vague the
world below presents die problem how-
wili modern man behave in a world totally
different from the one in which he grew
up there is apparently only one way of
getting into the future and that is via the
fourth dimension which has been employed
considerably by scientific fiction writers
ever since mr wells invented the time
machine

  the hero of the world below is pro-
jected by professor danby  years
into tlie future he arrives in a strange
world where trees scream while they at-
tack where the hot soil projects rubber-
like roots to trip the wanderer where
voiceless froglike monsters are peeled and
eaten a la banana by gigantic human beings
called the dwellers a world where the
seas are peopled and controlled by furry
humanlike yet sexless females who tele-
pathically communicate their thoughts to
one another regardless of distance

  after any number of queer adventures
fights rescues ctc he is finally brought
back to his own time

  this book is puzzling to a considerable
extent it is vague throughout yet this
very vagueness is not without its charm
it reminds one faintly of alice in won-
derland in which everything is impos-
sible yet seems quite true

  in the amphibian which accompanies
the hero on his adventures mr wright
has pictured an unusual creature whose
gentle charm will not easily be forgotten

a defense or our authors

editor amaiw stokies

your amazino storiss are amazingly wonder-
ful a real stimulant for the mental faculties
those readers who arc continually finding technical
errors and apparent impossibilities in the au-
thors stories should use a little discretion the
name amazing stoeies is all that it implies

thee stories are replete with educational and
scientific matter invaluable in themselves the
author weaves these scicatisc topics into his
story in a sirailifed and instructive style sc- the
lay-mind can readily grasp it the authors do not
cxpcct their readers to assume everything in their
stories to be literal facts  the reader being in
mi possession of his reasoning and perceptive
faculties should be somewhat circumspect in dif-
ferentiating between the real and the false ac-
cepting the former aud rejecting the latter al-
though the latter being ill the abstract it should
be weighed in the balance

quite a few of the present discoveries and in-
ventions were looked upon as absurd and pre-
posterous hut let us remember we are in the
twentieth century of wonderful accomplishments
and actualities we are passing by gradations
into the realm of the marvelous the future is
pregnant with latent potentialities andtheir con-
ceptions are gradually emanating from the brain
of man man will some day stumble upon the
riddle of the universe and will ultimately dis-
cover the potert forces whicv hare been responsi-
ble for its creation and his own

a letter from captain meek
about the red peril

editin akazino stories

if you can spare me a little space in ycur dis-
cussions column i will endeavor to answer some
of the objections raised to the statement made in
the red peril that the existence of a gravity
screen would exhaust the atmosphere of the
eartb to begin with i cannot prove my point
once an author leaves the realm of present
scientific knowledge which ia susceptible of proof
and ranges out into the field of scientific fantasy
j best that can be cone is to show that the lines
of present knowledge are extended

the objections seem to fall into three general
groups each of which i will discuss in turn

   objection  if a gravity screen were placed on
the earth gravity emanating from adjacent points
on the earths surface would soon overcome the
effects of the screen and the volume in which
gravity was interrupted would be a cone whose
base would be the screen answer gravity was
assumed to be a wave motion of zero wavelength
such a force would not emanate from every point
on the earths surface but from one point viz the
center of gravity of the earth if we assume that
the center of gravity lies at or near the center of
form of the earth the rays or lines of gravity
would leave the earths surface virtually normal
to that surface and the volume in which gravity

whose apex would be the center oi gravity of the
earth whose base would be an area larger but
corresponding in shape to the scrccn at the limits
sicl of the universe and whose upper surface
would he the gravity screen this ia illustrated by

   objection  if the answer given to objection 
 is correct the natural bondin of the rays or lines
 of gravity would have the effect of filling in the
 void thus created and the volume of interrupted
 gravity would again foe a cone whose bnc was the
 screen aiuwcr the tendency of a wave motion
 to berd around obstacles ia a function nf its
 wavelength a long wave bends more readily than
 a short one thus an obstacle atouud which a
 sound wave will readily bend will inteirupt a light
 wave ie cast a shadow which has a shorter
 wavelerstb if the wavelength of gravity is zero
 the tendency to bend should lie entiiely eliminated
 and the wave would oontinue to infinity in straight
 lines norria to the earths surface the volume
 of interrupted gravity would still be the frustum
 of a cone as shown above the following diagram

  objection  as the air released by the gravity
  screen rose from the earth it would be thrown to
  the west out of the space where gravity lias been
  interrupted and so again become subject to the
  earths gravity and return to the earth answer
  tho released air already has a circular motion
  else we wovld have constantly a thousand mile
  gale at the equator blowing around the earth to
  the west a condition which docs not exist the
  momentum of the air would keep it going in the
  same circular direction in which it was going when
  it left tlie earth ami it would stay within the
  volume uf interrupted gravity cxcept as it was
  dragged cut of that space by tho force of gravity
  from eome other heavenly body where no gravity
  screen was interposed between tho center of gravity
  of the attracting body and the affected air

  with a romance and foundation that made it quite
  interesting and although i knovy not black o tkt

you may not like the next statement but im
going to say it of nil the stories you have

   after reading some of the valueless letters of
some of your readers who are more eager to see
their names in print than to say something worth-
while i told mysef id never write in to discus-
sions till i had something of importance

   the time has arrived

   geoffrey martin o london university who
claims to be tho first man to advance the via
that radium and radioactive substances are de-
composing into simpler elements may  his
written a bonk entitled modern chemistry andits
wonders published in j toward tho end
of the bonk in a chapter on sodium chloride he
gave a description nf a world wlicse atmosphere
was chlorine i we know of no such world but
there is no particular rpson to suppose that
some planets are not met with occasionally among
the myriads thronging space with such an atmos-
phere tlie chlorine saturates the entire globe
chcmicaliy and some is left over as the atmos-
phere the heavens of the planet would beto the
inhabitants a dense yellow color it would
merit the name of the yellow planet through
its gloomy ravines and valley may stalk strange
forms of life-life which would necessarily be
based on ari entirely different chemical plan from
that which underlies our terrestrial life the
atmosphere could never be pure chlorine there
would have to be oxygen loo if there had been at
one time water because chlorine in direct snri-
light decomposes water forming hydrogen chloride
and releasing oxygen if there were such a large
excess of water that it couid come into equilibrium
with the eliloriue there would then be ail acid
sea and an atmosphere of chlorine and oxygen few
minals could exist in the free state not even gold
rrd most everything solid would e a chloride
another curious condition on the yellow planet
would be the absence of irsst organiccoloring
matter  the beautiful greens blues pinks and
reds which characterize our vegetation and fovers
-would certainly be absent from this chlorine
world because chlorine gas and also its solu-
tion is one of the best bleaching agents known

   would it be possible to light a candle or smoke
a cisarel a candle would burn but in a
remarkable way showing a blood-red same-and
immense clouds of -soot would arise from it-be-
cause chlorine has a very great affinity for hy-
drogen and hardly any for carbon a candle
is entirely made up nf hydrogen and carbon

  editor amazing stouis

  i have just finished the january issue of our
  magazine-we get it ear iiet-ard again i
  have to thank yo for a very enjoyable nights
  reading

  starting from the front the cover was cx-
  nellcnt the best for months the editorial as
  usual gives aw instructive tea minutes on the
  subject which is just coming into the public eye
  it wouldnt be loic before wc are dieting -o main-
  tain a constant hrdily temperature throughout the
  year it would he comfortable-to say the least

  beyond the <lre>j prism justifies itself as a
  sequel and if part ii is anything like part i the
  four parts bound uigether would make a very
  interesting hook

  sequels are a soud idea because they show the
  author the points raised about the stoy and he can
  answer them as be comes to then i the secuel
  judging by the storm of comment raised about
  the skylark of space the sequel will be better
  if possible than the story itself i an- glad to see
  it already in the offing

  i would like your opinion on he following

  ijoes prravity take time to travel or make itself
  felt between bodies

  may we assume that gravity lias azero wave
  length from the-following  light is stopped by a
  number nf stibstancc by light i riean the-c
  rays having n wavelength of over  bn

  length correspordingly decreased some of the
  s-jbstances nraiue before now become transparent
  ie a thin slwt of lead will stop light but is
  easily passed by tlie much shorter wavelength of
  x-rays there is no known substance which is
  opaque to gravitr so it would look as if rravity
  possesses an inaite frequmuy and a-wave of zero

  last but far from least is the fourth di-

  it gives some faint idea of the infinite small-

  conversely it makes one think of the solar system
  as nn atom in some vaster cosmos the inhabitants
  of which perhaps think of our mighty universe
  much as we think of that little drop of water
  oh its not worth bothering about rather a
  blow to our pride isnt it

  those four very interesting items on page 
  of january issue by e e free phd are just
  what wc have been waiting for as they will help
  to fill the many scrapbooks which i am sure

  be a much happier and more intelligent retreat

a curious criticism of
the ice man

  editor amazing stories

  it is an infrequent thing for me to address
  the editor of any periodical with reference to
  the various articles or tories which appear in
  their magazines but i can not forbear to do so
  in the case of one appearing in your february
  issue of amazing stories under the title of
  the ice man-
  first permit me to say that my attention was
  first drawn to your magazine when many months
  ago i observed that my son had several copics of
  same in his room where he spent many hours
  reading them i was a bit concerned regarding
  tho class of literature which seemed to attract him
  and gave the magazine my personal attention for
  sc mo hours in order to determine whether the
  subject matter was of a type i cared to have him
  spend his time in reading it is a compliment
  to you when i tell you that he has been per-
  mitted to purchase each issue since that time
  and that many or the stories have been interesting
  to me and there have been many pleasant mo
  ments spent in the discussion of outstanding
  stories over a period dating back to the original
  issue of the book

  i am myself inclined to anticipate tlie next
  issue because i find a relaxation and au oppor-
  tunity for mental gymnastics which are refresh-
  ing aid stimulating within the pages of each
  issue

  true there have been stories and articles ol
  which i did not approve and the reading of
  which seemed to me to be a total loss of time
  however they have been in the minority and as
  wc all must take a little of the bad with the good
  in this life my objections have not been seiious
  enough to prompt me heretofore in making any
  comment to you but i want to stale the fact

amazing stories

 that the ice man not only does not have any
 claim whatsoever to be classed in what your or-
 ganization so aptly terms scientifiction but is
 an evil sensuous vulgar anc immoral exhibition
 of rot and lius no place or ciaim tc a place in a
 magazine x gjn led ui believe is read by thousands
 of the nations youths

 it properly belongs jn that class of literature
 which is dented admission to the jnail and must
 depend for distribution upon the facilities af-
 forded by the express company i can not be-
 lieve that your editorial board reviewed the
 story as it certainly should have been reviewed
 before publication in your magazine i am will-
 ing to give your board the benefit of the belief
 that they bjive beer imposed upon in this in-

 staucg

 i wish to make the emphatic statement however
 that a recurrence of any similar article in the
 future will certainly dispose me to enjoin my son
 from purchasing ocher numbers

 in closing let me slate that i believe if
 other parents of boys who real your book were
 asked to voice their opinion of this fitory their
 attitude would be the	y  inc and this

 heiief can best he proved by the publication of
 this letter in your discussion column inviting your
 readers to further comment

 the ice man seemed to us to be an im-
 pressive somewhat sarcastic depiction of the
 doings and fallacies of the present day reading
 it can hardly do any one any harm because the
 peculiar reactions which the ancicnt roman experi-
 enced were so outstanding the story has elicited
 much praise and was greatly admired by a goodly
 numbor of our readers still we should like to
 bear from more parents on this subject-editor
