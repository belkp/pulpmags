ello gang

  were having snappy weather
now-or are you down on some
tropical island where its warm all the
time well up where i am at the moment
the chilly breezes are blowing round and
round so i suggest that we get in out of
the cold and gather around while some of
the gang light up a fire for this gab-fest

  stanley griffin youre from wilkins-
burg pennsylvania you should know
how to build a fire and make it burn
suppose you be the piler-oner-and billy
ball of arlington texas you bring in
some of that crackling gnarled cedar
youve got down your way bill thorn-
berg of wilmington ohio you help billy
with the wood and carmen nacci give
me a hand with these hot dogs and well
let you and jerry bloom from brooklyn
do the roasting of the dogs now hows
that are we off

  oh-oh listen to this for a starter

  dopey g-

    i have read your magazine for ex-
  actly six issues and i want to say that
  it is the lowest form of literature why
  dont you get some reason in your
  stories all you have is excitement and
  thats all right sometimes but ive been
  studying shakespeare in school and be-
  lieve me that guy could write

    furthermore why dont you kill off
  some character sometimes you only
  kill the ones that we dont care about
  anyway how about letting g- really
  cut off herr doktor kruegers head
  one of these times and then dry the old
  herr doktors head and hang it up in
  the living room of the end hangar
  apartment

    you certainly can turn out the most
  fantastic stuff i ever read how do you
  expect a guy to understand and believe
  such stuff when you never get more
  than a scratch yourself who are you
  superlady or somebody

     yours for more literary class in the
  g- stories

                             dis atisfied

  well dis youve put up a high star to
hook our ambitions to so youre study-
ing shakespeare are you well now ive
got nothing against shakespeare he was


a good writer too but i just wonder
gang how many of you would like to see
g- and his battle aces made over on the
general pattern of as you like it or
hamlet drop us a line and let us know
what you think about this

  and so you want kruegers head
chopped off right in public why you
bloodthirsty guy after all the little fel-
low was just giving out for dear old ger-
many and you cant blame him for that
-or can you

  well dont lose too much sleep over it
dis because the fact that you stuck with
us for the last six issues shows that we
have something you spend money for
even if you dont like it

  and now gang from good old georgia
comes the following letter from a new
member of the gang-william smith of
 jackson st box  hapeville
ga and he has this to say

  dear c-

     have been reading your mag only
  a short time but i have managed to
  get old ones as far back as 

    i have just finished tito death
  monsters last patrol

     i would like to enroll as a lone agent
  as i cant get a chapter started of my
  own

    will you please send me the names
  of books where i can study about air-
  planes theory of flight and about air-
  plane engines

     and please tell me where to order a
  practice buzzer

yours truly

                       william smith

  well william about that buzzer right
now i cant tell you where to get one
the armed forces are using about the en-
tire output of that sort but here are a
couple of suggestions how about looking
in the for sale ads of the big-town
papers also you might put an ad in the
wanted section of the paper telling what
you want or you might look through the
ads in the electrical magazines

  here is a list of reference books which
may be either purchased or borrowed
from your local library

of the iron claw

 to robert j hogan

chapter one
herr goulons hate

 his voice came in a rasping croak
 as though his throat were only
 part human and the other part
 was frog

   i have studied victory and control by
 terror most outstanding was my visit to
 japan there meine herren is the great-
 est example of control through fear and
 terror in the mashi prison i saw-




g- and his battle aces

  one moment herr goulon the hun
general on his left interrupted

  the crippled beast-man shot an enraged
glance at the enquiring general his sunk-
en bloodshot eyes became horribly fierce
and cruel

  i assume that your study of terror be-
gan with your hatred for a certain ameri-
can spy the general suggested i re-
fer to the man known as g-

  at the mention of that name the hatred
in the ghastly face increased tenfold his
croaking voice became a snarl more than
ever like the sound that an animal might
make

  you see in me meine herren one to
frighten strong men at sight you know
my story perhaps this same-this
cursed verdammter hund g- shot me
down in flames and then in a hospital
of the amerikaner swine i was purposely
made ghastly-as i am now

  another german general at the other
side of the table asked you are sure of
that you are certain that the american
doctors made you a cripple on purpose
it could not have been the accident and
the flames that disfigured and crippled
you you have proof

  proof the maniac screamed you
want proof then look at me would
anyone believe that i could live in such a
condition unless i were made so on the
operating table  look at my left leg
twisted and shorter than the other look
upon my face if you can there was not
enough skin left they said to cover my
face so they drew it tighter they drew
it so tight that i am like a four-thousand-
year-old mummy-with skin so tight that
i cannot close my mouth himmel you
want proof look what they left me for
a mouth a gaping hole without lips that
come together and look at my left arm
look at it his voice terminated in a
shrill cry

  herr goulon stopped in his shrieking
to pant for breath through the hole which
was not a mouth and through the two
openings in his flat nose that was not a
human nose

  see what they left me for an arm a
stump on which i have added mv new
hand

  he waved his left arm about at the
end of the stub below the elbow was an

iron shield that fitted over the stub
welded to the iron sleeve or shield was
his new hand

  it was a wicked thing that new hand
a series of three hooks like the claws of
a giant cat but these glistening polished
iron claws were curved down so that his
movements made gouging gestures each
of the three metal claws was sharpened
on the inside of the curve to a keen razor-
edge

  with this he shrilled i will yet
tear the heart out of the verdammter
hund he shall know before he dies
the monster he made-

  eine minute the general at his left
interrupted you were speaking of the
terror

  herr goulon paused panting for
breath again in his furious excitement
the terror he breathed jazvohl he
was forcing himself to have respect for
these generals about the table he took
time to compose himself and then he be-
gan again in a voice that still retained
the croak but was more subdued

  meine herren-bitte you will pardon
my-my enthusiasm for my plan the
terror jawohl

  he took more time to compose himself
with a handkerchief he wiped the drool-
ing from the gaping hole in his face now
he placed the handkerchief back in his
pocket and placing the hooks of his left
arm and his right hand onto the edge of
the table he leaned forward a little and
began

  have you ever considered meine
herren what might take place in the mind
of a soldier of any nation were he to learn
that the doctors and nurses who would
care for him if wounded had been taken
away and could no longer serve his medi-
cal needs

  he straightened and his sunken blood-
shot eyes flashed from the face of one
general to another their expressions
seemed rather satisfactory and he went
on

  that is my plan excellencies we
will dispose of the doctors and nurses
of the allies slowly at first then more
rapidly we will begin our reign of terror
by taking away first those agents who
could make our future victims well
again
the wings of the iron claw



a large man wearing a generals
nniform leaned forward at the far
end of the table his heavy brows knit to-
gether in a puzzled expression

  just how do you expect to accomplish
this herr goulon

  the beast tried to grin and the effort
sent a shudder through his audience

  this would be the simplest part of
my proposed plan he said i already
have an army of specially trained and
equipped agents who can on ten minutes
notice slip into allied territory and begin
their work the work of these men will
be thorough you may depend upon it i

  very well he said quietly you
have heard all you are going to hear the
plan is mine-its enjoyment appears to
belong to me as well that is all i have
to say

  they looked at him and at each other
anxious but doubtful and herr goulon
smiled hideously finally one of them
leaned forward and demanded might
i make one small suggestion herr gou-
lon

  jawohl excellency goulon said
more politely than he felt

  let us put it this way the general on
his left suggested glancing at the other

out of the caverns of the lost came the sinister heastmen of herr
ooulon hunlands ace master of murder-and to save the world
he was fighting for the ace american flying spy had to undertake

a solo-heyond the grave

have spent a long time selecting them i
have been preparing them ever since-i
became what i am

  but how are they to get into france
these many agents of yours

  that goulon grinned hideously is
my secret for the moment i have worked
that out except for a few chosen men
no one knows of my method for enabling
my men to cross the battle lines-and i
must insist on keeping my secret the
method is mine-i devised it and it shall
be used only for my own purposes all i
ask of your excellencies is the permission
to go ahead and the backing of the vater-
land in whatever i may deem necessary
you have not entirely answered my
question the inquiring general insisted

  it will not be so simple to do away with
the doctors and nurses of the allies
herr goulon made a cackling sound
which was meant for laughter it didnt
impel kii i--ecrs to join him but he
promised them you will laugh also
when i tell you

  the others averted their faces-and
goulons laughter died a savage look
crossed the malformed features-disap-
peared

commanders this american spy g-
has already bested you in two engage-
ments herr goulon you were fortunate
to get off both times with your life we
have no guarantee that he may not best
you a third time in this venture-and that
this time you may not live-

  the taut skin on the face of herr gou-
lon had rapidly darkened to a deep pur-
ple and his eyes were redder than ever

  you may be sure- he began his
voice rising to a screech

  eine minute the general cut in u
was about to add that in that unfortunate
instance-we shall be helpless to continue
your plan let us stipulate then that
the first step of your plan must be to put
g- out of the way to kill him any way
you please after that i believe i may
safely say that you will have the sanction
and even the blessing of the high com-
mand he glanced at the other generals
are we agreed gentlemen

  heads nodded presently in agreement
and voices rumbled in assent

  herr goulon stood glaring purple-
faced at the end of the table he raised
the wicked three-pronged claw of his left
arm

  very well tncine herrenhe croaked


g- and his battle aces

i shall perform the execution within
the next twenty-four hours he held
the iron claw higher as a token i
shall tear the swine to shreds-and it
will be the greatest pleasure of my life

chapter two

death at dawn

at that moment the man for whom
herr goulon held so much bitter
hatred braked his car at the end hangai
at le bourget field north of paris

  this young american who was known
only by the letter and number g- had
been in conference in paris with the only
superior he was compelled to recognize
the yanks commander in chief and was
now bringing the results of that confer-
ence to the airfield at le bourget where
his battle aces awaited him

  with an easy movement g- slipped
from the low powerful roadster that the
army had placed at his disposal and
strode across the concrete floor of the
great end hangar past several spads and
toward a door at the other side opening
that door he passed into the quarters that
he and his battle aces called both head-
quarters and home

  it was a comfortable apartment built
as part of the end hangar as he entered
the apartment a low growl greeted him
like the roar of a lion for an instant he
froze and instinctively his hand went to
the big colt automatic at his side

  the roar came again he had it gener-
ally located now it came from the direc-
tion of the kitchen there was a scurry
of feet and a deep bellowing voice
growled you crazy little squirt this
time ill choke all the tricks out of you

  more struggling and then a lighter
higher-pitched voice

  youve got to catch me first you big
ox

  g- strode across the living room as
he pushed open the kitchen door there
was a crash as if the kitchen utensil de-
partment of a department store had been
blasted by a bomb

  a dozen pots and pans littered the
floor in the path of a roaring giant who
was making a stumbling charge through
the wreckage at a smaller man

  come on you big ox the smaller
man cried right through the middle of
the line

  he was nippy weston the terrier ace
who flew spad number  and could laugh
in the face of the devil or death

  the big fellow stumbled lost his foot-
ing and went crashing flat on his face
among the rattling crashing pots and
pans the powerful bull-necked iron-
jawed young man was another of g-s
battle aces he was bull martin former
all-american halfback bull martin who
at times felt he could lick the whole ger-
man army with his bare fists but who
flew spad number  because he figured
seven was his lucky number and he could
use all the luck he could get

  bull leaped to his feet with a roar and
charged-right into the arms of g--for
nippy weston had ducked under g-s
arm and gone racing into the living room
beyond

  he hung there panting for an instant
and then another voice reached them it
was the english accent of battle master
of the make-up kit and general manserv-
ant besides being one of the flying four

  i say whats happened-

  his face was bland his feet showed
bare under his long nightshirt

  two bombs g- grinned one
named nippy and the other named bull
landed squarely in your kitchen battle

  let me get that squirt bull martin
raved

  g- laughed take it easy bull were
going to be needed at the front tomorrow
at sunrise dont murder nip until after
that show

  bull grew calmer no kidding we
get a crack at heinie

  the night is clear tonight g- said
and the weather report is fair for tomor-
row so it looks as if the show were on
at dawn

  nippy came drifting back toward the
kitchen door no kidding we really get
something to do tomorrow  i havent
had my hand on the stick of old  since
it started raining horses and cows three
days ago think the field will be dry
enough 

  well take off on the apron tomorrow
morning g- said youll take the ex-
tra spad battle and well all go
the wings of the iron claw



  okay whats the dope on the opera-
tion bull asked

  youve known about that g- said
nothing much changed from the origi-
nal plan giiq has decided weve got
to take hills  and  it means a lot
of fighting the germans are firmly en-
trenched on both objectives the general
says well have heavy losses in getting
those hills but weve got to have them
those hills are holding up our entire op-
erations along that sector

  g- paused then went on i hate to
see a drive like this its bad enough when
we expect normal losses but these are
going to be more than that the general
phoned the hospital head of this entire
area to expect heavy reception of
wounded he wants to be sure theyre pre-
pared to take care of the stretcher casual-
ties

  they were silent for a moment then
bull said yeah-when you stop to
think a lot of the boys that are sleeping
right now will be asleep forever by tomor-
row night-

  nippy pulled out his handkerchief and
handed it to bull here you big ape-
cry in this what do you want to do live
forever 

  g- stripped off his coat and started
for his bedroom

  im hitting the hay he said we get
up at four-thirty and get a good break-
fast inside us we dont know when well
get a decent chance to eat again good
night

it wasnt much after four in the
morning when water in the showers
began sputtering from the kitchen cams
the odor of bacon frying and coffee boil-
ing

  one by one g- and his battle aces
met in the living room they were silent
tense keyed-up for action battles un-
ruffled voice announcing breakfast al-
most startled them-then broke the ten-
sion

  nippy weston his eyes on bull martin
said you know what you always act like
at breakfast bull you act like youd been
dreaming all night of starving to death-
and still believed it

  why shouldnt i eat bull retorted
im man-sized a squirt like you cant

hold more than a half-slice of toast a sip
of coffee and a hunk of bacon you should
talk you fox terrier

  g- wasnt paying attention to the
bantering he sipped his coffee and ate
his toast thoughtfully then rose and go-
ing to the door that opened into the stor-
age end of the hangar called to his
mechanic sergeant better fill our racks
with bombs well want to unload them
on the fortifications on those two german
hills

  he came back and sat down nippy
turned to his chief is that what were
going to do-lay a few eggs on the hill
heinies

  for a starter g- said

  he finished his breakfast in silence as
though he had a presentiment of what was
coming without being sure

  battle left the dishes in the kitchen he
joined them pulling on his flying togs as
he came out onto the tarmac

  the eastern sky was growing brighter
by the time they went to the field four
spads were ticking over on the line en-
gines warming the first was battles
extra spad then came spad number 
that nippy weston so defiantly flew and
next spad number  that bull hoped
would always bring him luck last there
stood g-s spad

  they walked to their respective charg-
ers and climbed into their cockpits g-
waved the others away and one by one
they taxied clown to the end of the apron
for the take-off

  he watched them go roaring by and
rise against a lightening sky once they
were in the air he kicked his spad around
and taxied rapidly down to the end of
the apron for his own take-off his hand
was on the throttle he gunned the his-


g- and his battle aces

so and pushing the stick forward to lift
the weight of the tail for the turn he
kicked rudder

  the spad shuddered and spun around
in a sharp turn picking up speed down
the tarmac

  suddenly above the roar of the spad
came another sound-a croaking rasp-
ing bellow-and something not human
came charging at him from the grass at
the edge of the field

  for an instant g- froze there wasnt
time to give his hisso the gun and pull
away from this monster thing he saw a
gaping hole where a mouth should have
been red bloodshot sunken eyes and a
three-pronged metal claw that flailed at
him desperately he saw the drawn skin
on a face contorted in hideous hate as the
metal claw caught at one of his wing struts
-held on

  he knew an instants shocked incredu-
lous recognition as he fought the lurching
spad and then with incredible agility
the creature had swung onto the wing
grasped the side of the cockpit

  g-s hand flashed for his gun but the
three-pronged hook was over his head
ready to descend

  one move and i tear off your face

  g- froze

  his dazed mind was still struggling
with the incredulous realization that this
monstrous creature was a man-a man
he had once seen die-

  g- didnt speak he raised startled
eyes to the sky for a farewell look at his
comrades-and saw a flight of german
planes

  nippy and bull and battle were engag-
ing them no one of the spads was com-
ing over to see why he didnt take off   

  the monster screamed again ill kill
you-

  g- grabbed for his automatic and at
the same time he lunged his head and
shoulders toward the beast-man instead
of away from him

  the hooks missed his head and im-
bedded themselves in his shoulder but
something hard-the iron sleeve or cup
that held the hooks to the arm stub-
struck him in the head with terrific force

  the daylight faded-all light and sound
vanished and total unconsciousness took
possession of the master spy

chapter three

beast-man

almost the full attention of bat-
tle bull and nippy had been cen-
tered at the time of their take-off
 getting into the air and heading toward
the front and their objectives

  but scarcely had nippy lifted his
wheels off the ground and sighted his eyes
along the nose of his spad  when he
had spotted enemy planes roaring in out
of the north his first thought had been
startled curiosity-had the enemy known
about their plan to attack hills  and


  from the way the enemy planes came
thundering over now it was evident that
they were hurrying to cut down the ris-
ing spads bull and battle lunged to the
counter attack and soon vickers and
spandaus chattered in discordant fury

  nippy weston turned back to cover
g-s take-off his hands and feet auto-
matically working the controls of spad
 the battle-scarred crate shuddered
in a vertical bank-and then he was
streaming back for a closer look his eyes
narrowed in surprise

  it seemed to him that a second figure
had leaped onto the side of g-s plane
whether or not the figure was threaten-
ing he couldnt tell because of the dim
morning light the ground haze and the
distance and then metal glinted in the
early morning light over g-s head and
nippy swore he sent the spad into a
screaming dive scarcely believing his
eyes the thing clinging to the wing of
the moving plane below took monstrous
shape-he caught a glimpse of hideous
features of a gleaming claw that descended
toward g-s head

  g- slumped over either killed by the
blow or stunned

  nippy weston yelled and crouched be-
hind his vickers gun sights-but it was
too great a risk he didnt dare take the
chance a slug might hit g--there was
no way of telling whether the master spy
was dead or not

  the figure on the plane wing turned
his ghastly face and stared up for an in-
stant then afraid that nippy would fire
he yanked g-s limp bod half out of
              this thin gillette sure has the stuff-
              talks turkey to beards plenty tough--
              lasts long shaves fast saves dough as well
              and thats why wise men say its swell

price

produced by the maker of the famous gillette blue blade

the wings of the iron claw

the cockpit and held it before him while
nippy continued to dive on him

  from behind the terrier ace came the
rattle of spandau lead at least one of
those fokkers was riding his tail he
zigzagged spun round in his seat and
his eyes caught the fokker behind and
the line of tracers ribboned in a yellow
haze

  he pulled up an instant before his nose
plowed the earth beside g-s ship he
climbed for room to chandelle the fok-
ker sent a burst of slugs through his right
wing and kept them coming closer to
the cockpit

  furiously nippy lashed the stick the
other way half-rolled pulled out of that
maneuver and came yowling down on the
tail of the fokker as it cut out to turn
back at him

  the terrier ace crouched behind his
sights everything depended on him now
bull and battle were hard-pressed a mile
or so to the north only he could settle
with that hook-handed devil 

  he watched his white tracers missing
the cockpit of the maneuvering fokker

by inches he tried frantically at the last
moment to correct his aim by a movement
of the stick but the german pilot was too
fast and skillful

  he rolled out from under got on top
again before the terrier ace could maneu-
ver out of the way another burst of span-
dau slugs came tearing through his other
wing

  furiously nippy turned directly into
the path of the enemy pilot taking the
chance of a collision the german swung
away wildly and nippy made a quarter
turn swift and tight and steep-and his
vickers lined up straight and true

    e pressed the triggers grinning
as he saw the white tracer ribbons
slash out into the clear morning air and
vanish into the cockpit of the fokker
he grinned and then when the pilot of
the enemy crate slumped and black smoke
belched from the cockpit he whirled to
look down

  there was a limp form lying at the end
of the apron and down the tarmac a spad
went racing at full throttle trying to get


g- and his battle aces

into the air someone on the ground was
firing

  nippy could hear the barking of a gun
even above the roar of his hisso then
he saw a mechanic sergeant firing with
his colt automatic at the racing spad
and that meant that g- wasnt in the
cockpit it meant that the crumpled fig-
ure lying face down in a heap at the end
of the apron was g-

  a surge of boiling fury seized nippy
weston he battered the throttle of his
spad wide open and charged in pursuit
glancing ahead he saw the dogfight that
bull and battle had taken on shaping up
into a victory for them one fokker had
crashed and another was going down
pocketed by the two spads the third
spad was hightailing for home

  bull and battle had been too busy to
look back and see what had happened
over the field but now they must help
with the fleeing madman in g-s plane
somehow nippy must contact them the
need became urgent as the spad below
lifted-the bullet-battered number 
was no match for g-s spad and under
his anxiety nippy had the same ghastly
suspicion g- had had-the monster had
seemed strangely familiar

  of course goulon was dead nippy
kept telling himself that and dead men
simply dont steal planes and fly off with
them-but nippy couldnt repress a chill
   he tried to keep his mind on the set-
up ahead herr goulon-if it was he-was
flying g-s plane-and battle and bull
wouldnt suspect who it was goulon
might take them by surprise-they
wouldnt suspect anything until the vick-
ers guns of g-s spad had drilled them
both he must try to get word of warning
to them somehow

  he pressed the triggers of his twin
vickers guns but no luck goulon was off
the ground now and climbing nippys
dive was gaining on him but he was still
a long way off the fokker that now was
a burning wreck at the south boundary of
the field had taken nippy below the field

  there seemed to be nothing to do but
give his best and trust to luck he turned
back once to glance at the field an ambu-
lance had reached g- a lump rose in
his throat and then anger welled in him
a blind pounding rage he punched the

throttle to see if he couldnt get a little
more speed out of number  the fact
that he was diving and goulon was climb-
ing helped a little-brought them closer

  bull and battle had turned back and
were circling waiting for g-s plane to
catch up with them nippy suppressed
a groan he was a good five hundred
yards out of range

  nippy settled low in his seat barely
peering over the edge of the cockpit as if
that would give him the extra mile or so
an hour that he so badly needed

  he and goulon leveled almost simul-
taneously and the german was heading
straight for battle and bull he was clev-
er enough to realize that if he tried to
break for germany g-s aces might
grow suspicious so he had decided to go
straight to them and fight it out with the
element of surprise strongly in his favor

  nippy was sure he had gained a little
space he might still be two or three
hundred yards out of good range he had
a bare chance of hitting the speeding
plane-one chance in a thousand if he
allowed for the trajectory   

  he took careful aim and waited another
second he pressed his triggers and his
straining eyes tried to push those tracer
ribbons farther out front before they died
away the ribbons didnt reach the fleeing
spad they died out yards before they
reached their objective

  he tried again straining forward with
all his might as though a prayer on the
tail of each bullet might make it go
farther  

  watching bull and battle he hoped
mightily that they would take warning
couldnt they see that he was firing on
that spad wouldnt they think some-
thing was wrong if they noticed that
wouldnt they be on their guard as the
g- spad came ever nearer

  suddenly his heart skipped a beat and
then seemed to stop altogether herr
goulon was within range now and he
opened fire nippy could see the white
tracer streaks lashing out-a puff of black
smoke leapt out and formed a cloud along
one side of battles spad

  battle was hit the bland-faced briton
loyal to the last was turning and going
down slipping to drive the smoke and
the flame from him
the wings of the iron claw



  and now herr goulon had turned he
was charging at bull in spad number 

chapter four

g- is deadt

nippy clamped down on his trig-
gers he let his vickers guns go
mad for vengeance they hurled
long futile streamers of white tracer
smoke out ahead but the lines died away
before their slightly arching course could
reach the racing spad

  bull had turned meanwhile and was
throttling back to come into formation
apparently he hadnt seen the demon in
the spad shoot down battles ship

  now the attack was on in full tracers
lashed out from the vickers juns of herr
goulon then bull whirled his spad
away at last and came around in a steep
bank obviously bewildered

  herr goulon could have followed him
up and given it to him but he didnt
apparently goulon was interested main-
ly in getting through he went racing for
germany bull finished his turn too late
to catch him in his sights

  nippy yelled futilely go after him
bull get him

  his words were wasted on the air and
space but nippy kept going and now
bull belatedly caught on they chased
the german over the front lines but al-
though bull tried several times as they
crossed the front to blast slugs into that
spad he was too late nippy being far-
ther behind simply wasted his ammuni-
tion

  a flight of seven fokkers loomed out
of the german sky ahead of them but the
spads were low on gasoline and ammuni-
tion by now and there was nothing for
them to do but turn back

  bull landed at le bourget as soon as
he could get in nippy roared back to the
south side of the field and circled the
spot where g- had been lying when he
left there was no sign of anything on
the end of the apron no sign even of
blood

that gave the terrier ace a little hope

  when he landed battle came limping
out of the hangar bull was with him the
big fellow was grinning

  theyre okay both of them he
said g-s come around and the doc
says hes doing fine

  nippy took a long breath sure glad
something good happened this morning
he admitted we thought you were a
goner battle

  battle said im afraid i would have
agreed with you sir a few moments ago
however i managed to get my plane
down without damage

  what about your leg nippy de-
manded

  bull grinned after the guy gets his
plane down without letting it burn up he
turns his ankle climbing out of his cock-
pit 

  what i want to know nippy de-
manded is why you didnt blast that guy
herr goulon out of the sky when he came
at you

  i was kind of slow on the up-take
bull admitted i didnt see battle shot
out of the sky i heard the shooting and
was looking around to see where it was
coming from and i missed battles getting
shot up when i turned again and saw
him going down trailing smoke i took
another look around to find the hun that
had shot him i still didnt figure out g-s
ship did it what happened anyway

  nippy told him what hed seen and
bulls eyes widened

  whats this about herr goulon

  i thought we finished him- battle
was equally bewildered

  we all thought so nippy said but
if herr goulon was killed in that explo-
sion then hes got a bumed-up twin
brother boy what an ugly buzzard he
turned out to be and nippys voice
rose in anger you could have stopped
him you big ape if you hadnt taken too
much for granted if youd worried about
battle instead of your own hide when
you heard that firing youd have seen
who shot him down

  the terrier ace turned to battle can
i see g-  have they got him at the hos-
pital 

  bull cut in with no visitors the
hospital surgeon sent word that hell be
all right theyre holding him for ob-
servation

   but hell be down for lunch sir bat-
tle said they promised that he disap-


g- and his battle aces

peared in the direction of the kitchen

bull looked reproachfully at nippy
listen squirt he said you dont
honestly think id let that guy get back
to germany on purpose do you 

  nippy forced a grin sure i know
he said but you cant blame a guy for
being disappointed at the buzzard getting
back it would have been so simple for
you to smear him if-

  sure i know bull said but- he
shrugged whats the use of trying to
tell you anything

  nippy lifted his helmet and scratched
his head theres one thing i cant figure
out he said when you turned away
from him he could have cut in and plas-
tered you all over the landscape but in-
stead he ducked straight for germany
and let you chase him almost within
range

  bull thought that one over for a long
moment and agreed i thought that was
queer too he said guess i just fig-
ured i had a lucky break i didnt think
beyond that he looked dejected may-
be a new brain would help he admitted
sheepishly

  maybe what you need is a brain
period nippy grinned and chucked the
big fellow in the ribs with his elbow im
only kidding bull forget it id have
done the same thing likely if it had been
me

  bull looked at his little pal curiously
whats got into you nip thats the
first time youve admitted you might be
an ordinary human being in a long time
nippy shrugged guess seeing the
chief and battle coming so close to get-
ting it makes things seem more serious
than usual

  an ambulance brought g- down in
time for lunch his head was still
bandaged but he was sitting up beside the
driver and he got out under his own pow-
er he walked calmly between nippy and
bull who had met him on the tarmac

  he grinned at the concerned expres-
sions of the two im okay just a clout
on the head and ive had plenty of them
before im lucky goulon didnt get his
claws into me

  at lunch he told what he remembered
of the attack there wasnt so much

what troubled him was what lay behind
goulons strange attack

  they were nearly through lunch when
battle answered a knock at the living
room door l- from intelligence came
in he was a quick little man with
glasses who looked as though he might
have just stepped out of a downtown hab-
erdashery shop

  this is an unusual pleasure g- he
said and he held out his hand to the mas-
ter spy did you know you were
dead

  dead g- demanded

  in germany l- said they are at
this moment celebrating your death two
of our resident spies have already wire-
lessed us to get the lowdown

  nippy and bull were both looking at
g- curiously the latter had made light
of his injuries-now they thought his
escape must have been closer than they
had imagined goulon had reported him
dead-and goulon in their experience
had seldom made a mistake-unless he
did it deliberately

  g- frowned do you have copies ijf
the reports

  yes l- said he drew them from
his pocket this is the first we received
and deciphered it came about an hour
ago the second one came about fifteen
minutes afterward

  g- scanned the first message then
read it aloud

  there is a report that g- is dead one
  herr goulon is reported to have killed him
  at le bourget field and then to have es-
  caped back to germany please confirm or
  deny

  the other message read

  g- reported killed herr goulon once
  known as the cripple of hartsburg has
  brought proof that he killed g- he has
  flown back from le bourget field in g-s
  own spad he was pursued for more than
  fifty miles inside germany by g-s squad-
  ron spads number  and 

  nippy weston snapped his fingers sud-
denly

  bull ive got it thats why herr
goulon didnt stay to finish you off he
wanted you and me both to chase him
into germany to confirm his report

  bull told g- this bird seems to have
the wings of the iron claw



a special reason for wanting his pals to
think you are dead

   the telephone on the wall jangled and
g- answered it

   yes general he said yes sir
quite all right as soon as ray head clears
a little more ill be as good as ever yes
sir    late this afternoon    this
evening    very well  of course   
ill be down sir    at your office this
evening    thanks

chapter five

claws in the night

nippy bull and battle waited ex-
pectantly as g- hung up the re-
ceiver and turned

  whats the bad news now nippy
demanded

   g- shrugged nothing yet he said
at least the general didnt mention any
he wanted to have a talk with me this
evening and i told him id be down hes
going to have the surgeon general down
there and wants me to meet him and an-
-sjyer some questions

   fd sure feel a lot better if i could get
 one question answered bull martin
 growled id like to know just what
 goulon has up his sleeve

  amazing nippy snapped that
stuff that fills your skull must be brains
and i always thought it was sawdust
bull jerked his head toward his little
pal and said with a wink to g- look
the loony thinks im nuts

   loony nippy exploded but g- in-
terrupted him

   take it away you two g- said
im going to lie down this afternoon and
see if i cant get my own bean to clear
up a little

   it was late in the afternoon just before
 dinner when g- appeared again he had
 removed the bandage and battle worked
 on his head he looked as though noth-
 ing of a serious physical nature had ever
 happened to him

   glancing at his wrist watch he said
well ill be shoving off

   he drove swiftly through the twilight
into paris and went straight to the gen-
erals offices and stepping in saluted
smartly the general looked up quickly

from his desk and answered his salute
g- said good evening general i
hope im not too early

  there was another man in the room
and at first g- was startled at the re-
semblance between the two then he no-
ticed the medical insignia on the latters
collar-the surgeon general

  the yank commander at the desk said
youre just on time g- this is gen-
eral greer surgeon general of the medi-
cal corps

  g- advanced and shook hands with
the surgeon general

  general greer resembled the great
yank commander only when he was seat-
ed now that he stood up g- could see
that he was shorter than the yank com-
mander

  the window was open behind him and
the breeze that blew in from over the
lower paris housetops rippled the papers
on the desk

  general greer placed a paper weight
upon them and said turning back to g-
im more than glad youve come g-
i had a little problem that your comman-
der assured me you could help clear up
the yank commander stood with a
slight smile on his face

  general greer didnt smile this was
no joke with him

  i hope g- ventured that i wont
have to prove that general greer

  the yank commander smiled a little
more broadly g- is modest about his
successes general greer the commander
said he has never failed us yet

general greer drew a small piece
of folded paper from his pocket and
handed it to g- this was found on


g- and his battle aces

the surgeon majors desk at base hospital
headquarters here in paris early this
morning

  g- unfolded the small piece of paper
and glanced at the writing the words
were english but the hand was a cramped
german script

    you and your staff are given warning
  give up your jobs today or you will die a
  horrible death

  there was no signature

  g-s eyes narrowed as he looked up
at greer what is the name of the sur-
geon major  he asked

  major bradley general greer said
g- looked puzzled thats funny
he said there seems to be something
that ties things together here but i cant
grasp it major bradley he shook his
head i havent heard the name before
and yet-

  the yank commander said because
of this warning general greer has had to
reorganize his staff

  g-s eyes widened you mean gen-
eral greer that you actually take some
stock in this warning note

  the general said i dont like to ap-
pear childish but weve reason to believe
theres something behind this note there
have been unexplained-and in some
cases inexplicable-accidents and the
staff is jittery theyre brave men and
women or they wouldnt be here but
theyre worried and right now with our
offensive under way we need all available
doctors and nurses and we need them in
the best mental and physical shape of
their careers

  i understand g- said i wont
hold you up in your work any longer and
i hope i can get something more definite
on this warning note sir

  the yank commander said come into
the next office please

  they passed into the office at the side
and the yank general closed the door

  at first he said in a low voice i
felt that general greer was exaggerating
the importance of this warning we have
all sorts of wounded and shell-shocked
men who have been in our hospitals and
then have been released after treatment
its always possible that one may have

developed a warped hatred for some hos-
pital attendant-or even against the hos-
pital itself that was what i felt when i
phoned you earlier today

  it didnt seem to me that you were
particularly excited about anything sir
g- said

  however the commander went on
since then general greer has all but con-
vinced me that something is wrong and
if he should prove right the results may
prove horrible our casualties are heavier
than ever if it were possible to conceive
an enemy so inhuman as to strike at our
wounded behind the lines-this would be
the ideal time for such an attack

  g- lighted a cigarette and then he
shook his head perplexedly

  i wish he said that i could get
what seems to stick vaguely in the back
of my mind that major bradley theres
something about him and his name that-

  g- broke off short and leaped to his
feet from the next office-the office
where they had left the surgeon general
came a ghastly cry it was a stifled chok-
ing scream   

chapter six

beast-maker

g- made a lunge for the door
tore it open and dashed through
general greer lay on the floor
horribly slashed his face neck and chest
were torn to ribbons the furniture in
the room gave evidence of almost unbe-
lievable violence

  the desk lay on its side and behind
general greer was the toppled desk chair
g-s eyes flashed to the open window be-
yond

  he had caught a sudden gleam of some-
thing on the window sill it was gone
now but it had lingered there for an in-
stant before vanishing into the night

  he heard the yank commander groan
even as he leaped for the light switch and
flipped it off

  the room plunged into semi-darkness
with a little light seeping through the door
from the inner office g- saw with satis-
faction that the section of the outer office
by the open window was particularly dark
he lunged for the window and then with-
g- froze in horror as
the gleaming claw came
closer   

out the slightest hesitation slipped over
the sill silently he slid into the dark
pocket of the alley below

  his feet touched the paving lightly he
could hear the confusion in the room
above the yank commander was calling
for help yelling for someone to turn on
the light

  then as g- squared himself and
braced for any attack that might come out
of the night the light splashed about him
from the window above

  he could see now but dimly he was
alone but some distance away a figure
was running softly as a cat

  g- only caught a glimpse of the other

as he rounded the back of the great head-
quarters building but the master spy
knew the layout of the grounds back there
there was a board fence   

  without hesitation g- dashed after the
other he ran with all the speed he could
force into his legs yet he was silent as a
ghost he reached the rear of the building
in time to see the foot of the man vanish
over the fence

  g- followed he went up and over
the fence without a sound his quick eyes
took in the dim view from the top of the
barricade the man ahead was doubled
over and running between two houses
heading for the back streets

  he reached the street in time to see the
other vanish around a corner

  g- didnt hesitate it was apparent




g- snd his battle aces

that the murderer knew he was being fol-
lowed then ducking low g- charged
ahead once more

the thing hit him with the force of a
battering ram g- was hurled back
by the blow he landed on his side and
with a roar a black object came charging
him like a savage bull

  there was a little light coming from a
dim street lamp across the street and by
that scant illumination he saw something
that surprised him his assailant seemed
to have curved talons on each hand he
could see their gleam as the monstrous
shape came slashing at him

  he struggled to his feet stumbled went
down scrambling as the dark shape hurtled
by thoje curved claws missing him

  it was too dark for him to recognize his
attacker frantically he tried as he fell
back from the charging beast-man to fig-
ure how he might capture the maniac alive
the others utter disregard for life made
the master spy fight down a swift surge
of panic hed have to pit his fists and
his clubbed gun against those flailing
claws

  the beast-man gave a savage leap his
body came hurtling through the air g-
caught his heel on the edge of the side-
walk he realized as he went down that
the death-dealing brute was going to land
on top of him the gouging hooks de-
scended   

  almost automatically g- reversed his
drawn and clubbed colt-his finger tight-
ened reflexively and the weapon roared
twice in fractional seconds he rolled
frantically as the other came down on
top of him pinioning his arm-he was
still struggling when he realized that the
weight holding him down was inert mo-
tionless

  he worked himself free and heard a
strangled groan from his erstwhile at-
tacker the others shape twitched once
and was still

  heavy feet were pounding the sidewalk
not far away a guard came running up
from the front of the headquarters build-
ing

  what-what is it sir

  he had his flashlight out and was blind-
ing g- with it the guard recognized
him saluted

  the master spy picked himself up the
warm automatic still in his hand

  not a word of this he said come
on help me carry this bird back to head-
quarters building got to get a look at
him before anybody else

  they picked up the unmoving form
he was surprisingly heavy they carried-
him through the back yard of the house
and then through a locked gate in the high
board fence the guard unlocked a back
door of the building and carried the body
into the basement

  they were both a little out of breath
when they laid the figure on the stone
floor it was dark in the basement and
g- decided against turning on lights
once more he cautioned the guard as to
secrecy

  but i have to report the doughboy
guard objected i have to report to the
officer of the guard-

  g- said ill take any responsibility

  the guard hesitated then he said
yes sir is there anything else i can
do

  just what im telling you g- said
say nothing about this to anybody this
is your secret and mine now go back the
way we came in circle around lock all
doors behind you and return to your post
if you are asked tell your commanding
officer that you met g- and that g-
said that the murderer had escaped

  the young yank saluted yes sir

  the guard left alone the master spy
locked the door of the room where the
body of the beast-man lay and went up-
stairs he found the yank commander
with a number of medical officers they
were gathered around the body of general
greer

  the yank commander shook his head

  he was almost dead by the time we
got to him g- he said i was waiting
for you to get back did you find any-
thing

  g- shook his head the murderer got
away never saw anyone move so swiftly
and so quietly in my life i lost out com-
pletely

  the general nodded to the others in
his outer office

  if g- doesnt want to make any fur-
ther inspection of general greers body
you may take him out
the wings of the iron claw



  g- bent down for a moment over the
prone bloody figure he studied the
marks left by the steel claws then stood
up nodded

  im through he said

when they were gone he went back
into the generals private office he
picked up the phone and called le bourget
field when he had nippy on the other
end of the line he said nippy i want
you to stay there but tell bull and battle
to come down as soon as they can to the
generals office and tell battle to bring
the big make-up kit

  theyll be right down if i have to ride
them there in a wheelbarrow nippy
promised

  when he hung up he found the general
watching him keenly

  theres something you have on your
mind that you havent mentioned yet
the general said

  nothing definite

  then what are you bringing bull and
battle and the make-up kit down here
for

  a plan-its still quite vague in my
mind sir

  the master spy seemed to have his
mind far away he lit a cigarette and
then after taking a few puffs on it snuffed
it out quickly and turned

  general ive got to go quickly i just
remembered who major bradley is

the general looked at him bewildered
major bradley is the famous plastic
surgeon-one of the best that we have
naturally the general said i could
have told you that

  yes i knew it g- said hurriedly
but hes a special one weve been hav-
ing trouble as you know with a german
named goulon it was he or an agent of
his who attacked and killed general
greer

  im afraid i dont follow you the
general said my understanding has been
that goulon was dead-

  ill explain more later g- said
herr goulon was badly burned in a crash
-after i shot him down a long time ago
major bradley was in the vicinity-he
may have tried to put goulon together
again without knowing goulons identity
there may have been a mix-up in records

-something ive got to find out it was
bradley who got the warning it all ties
up

  g- was at the door of the generals of-
fice

  call major bradley at once tell him
to keep his doors and windows locked
until i come tell him not to let anyone
come in except with the pass word
three will you do that

  g- didnt wait for any answer he
knew his chief they could depend on
each other

chapter seven

trap-door to hell

down before headquarters build-
ing he found his long low power-
ful roadster waiting where he had
left it he leaped behind the wheel and
started the engine roaring away from

        wvsr

the curb he sent the car charging down
the street in the direction of the base hos-
pital

  no telling where he might find major
bradley at this hour he might be at the
hospital and he might be at his living
quarters

  anyhow most likely the hospital at-
tendants could tell him where the major
was

  a young medical lieutenant was in
charge at the hospital desk when g-
rushed in the lieutenant looked a little
surprised

  ive got to find major bradley at
once g- said

  the lieutenant reached for a phone is
anything wrong

  plenty where will i find major
bradley 

  youll find him at his quarters he
said he would be there tonight if he were
needed hes at the building just west of
this west hospital wing it is where all


and his battle aces

the medical officers of the base hospital
are quartered

  the lieutenant was white-faced gen-
eral greer hadnt exaggerated when he
said the hospital staff was jittery he
froze suddenly from out of the night
came a scream the sound was short
choked-but the voice was a womans

  what-what was that the lieutenant
whispered his eyes were dilated a little
frantic

  where did it come from g- de-
manded

  i-i dont know i think-from the
building housing the nurses

  where is that

  thats at the end of the east wing
the lieutenant said ill send for-

  g- darted to the front door then he
whirled and headed for a wider darker
rear door the ambulance entrance he
guessed his hand was on his automatic
as he lunged out into the enveloping dark-
ness

  there was no sign of a living human
being outside he stood motionless for a
moment and then he heard another faint
muffled scream from the east

  for a perilous instant he stood trem-
bling a little in excited indecision then
he whirled and raced running lightly and
silently toward the sound

  he reached the entrance which was
dark and slipped inside there was no
sound now-no sign even of life inside
the building he stepped behind the desk
and brought up short

  behind the desk lay a uniformed figure
a corporal g- snatched at his shoulder
and turned the body over there were
horrible gashes across the corporals
throat and face and chest where iron
claws in sets of three had torn his flesh
open to the bone

  g- turned away and ran his eyes over
the switchboard he found the name of
major bradley and noted the number of
the room 

  he raced up the stairs to the third
floor the hall was lighted only by a sin-
gle dim bulb at the far end the other
lights were broken here and there he
saw smears of blood

  he reached the majors room and tried
the door it was locked drawing back
he sent his shoulder crashing into the

door and it gave way there was a light
still burning in the room but he didnt
need that to know what had happened
as he lunged into the room he stumbled
over the fallen body of the major lying
like the others in a red pool

  he snatched the phone from the ma-
jors desk and clicked the receiver the
line was dead-wires cut

running at top speed he raced down
the two flights of stairs and out into
the night again he stood panting a lit-
tle listening suddenly he heard a slight
crunching sound of a soft shoe on gravel
he froze into immobility under some over-
hanging shrubs which half-screened him
from the dim glow of the hospital building

  he saw a figure moving closer to him
and in the tiny light that filtered from
those few windows he saw the same glint
of shiny steel at the end of each arm of
the man

  this then was an executioner-anoth-
er one of the agents of goulon-a multiple
murderer who had done his job and was
leaving the scene of the crime

  g- remained motionless until the man
a big fellow bent forward a little at the
waist had passed by close enough to be
touched he waited until the glinting
claws were gone and the figure had melted
into the night

  then soundlessly he took up the trail

  for fifty feet he moved on without see-
ing the fellow guiding himself by sound
alone his hand was on the butt of his
automatic he had seen what those claws
could do   

  rounding the comer of the wing g-
saw the figure and then almost immedi-
ately lost him again but he had the
course that the man had taken he trailed
on

  the man came out on the back street
behind the great base hospital in the
dim glint of a street lamp g- saw him
slip off something like a metal glove from
each hand or fist he wasnt near enough
to see the claws clearly or the mechanisms
by which they were held to the wrists he
ouly knew that they were off and had
been slipped into the mans pocket

  the killer made no effort to hide his
presence now g- noticed him take some-
thing from his face and realized that he
the wings of the iron claw



must have been wearing some sort of a
mask the light hadnt been bright enough
when the fellow passed close to him earlier
for g- to see his features

  a block up the street two other figures
joined the man whom g- trailed the
presence of the three together satisfied
g- that he had been right in following
his prey rather than exacting immediate
vengeance still if they discovered him
he would be in trouble-each of the trio
was big-about the size of bull martin
or even larger

  they moved diagonally across the street
and headed across an open park g- was
forced to fall back there was not enough
cover to hide him until they came almost
to the middle of the park

  once there he could move faster
something told him to look back he did
and just in time two figures as large as
those three men whom he trailed ahead
were coming behind they were less than
fifty yards behind g- surely they had
seen the master spys figure moving in
the darkness behind the others

  in the first clump of shrubbery g-
vanished moving deep into the bushes
he heard the tread of feet of the other
two as he waited and then they were al-
most upon him

  they were talking low as they passed
sehr gut said one voice this is my
first night with the others i left hurriedly
tonight the leader said you would tell
me the password to get back to headquar-
ters

  ja the password- g- strained
his hearing but missed what followed
the two men moved on and this time he
followed a few steps behind if they
turned-or he made a misstep-discovery
was inevitable

  their talk drifted back to him and
presently he caught the word-gefangen

  g- dropped back again it was appar-
ent from the repeated mention of the pass-
word that they were heading for the same
place as the three ahead-some sort of
rendezvous for goulons henchmen

  the master spy kept them in sight
they came to the monument in the cen-
ter of the park and paused there g-
glanced about him for a split second to
get his bearings when he looked back
both men were gone

  the monument of la bareau stood in
the darkest most densely shrubbed and
wooded section of the park g- stood
waiting half hidden by shrubbery he
waited for nearly ten minutes and then
he moved back two short steps and
crouched someone else was coming along
the path

  the next man was alone he was as
large as the others he walked swiftly
to the monument apparently very sure of
himself pausing barely enough to reach
down a trap-door swung silently open

  the door was round larger than a
manhole cover the large man slipped
from sight and the door closed again

chapter eight

bull takes over

there had not been many times in
bull martins career when he had
a chance to be on his own he had
had his moments of course but he could-
nt remember more than one or two occa-
sions when g- had asked him directly to
take over in his place and no time had
been quite like this he faced his chief
eagerly at headquarters-but there were
interruptions

  the yank commander slammed his
phone and leaped from his chair for
the love of heaven g- do you know
whats happened

  i have a pretty good idea g- said
major bradley is dead as far as i can
tell many of his stall are dead and the
hospital except for perhaps some of the
night attendants is pretty much un-
manned

  thats only part of it the general
said he named three other hospitals that
had suffered about the same fate in the
last two hours this is the most cow-
ardly thing i have ever heard of 
i agree with you sir g- said

  the general seemed to be beside him-
self with inward agony he bellowed
well what are you doing about it
where have you been 

  ive been at the base hospital and in
the park west of there g- said ive
learned enough to go ahead with my
plans he glanced at battle i see you
brought your make-up kit battle thats


g- an bis battle aces

good lets go into the generals private
office and begin our work on bull g-
glanced about at several staff officers in
the room no wait battle well find
another place-

  the general stood before g- blocking
his way

  wait a minute the yank commander
said whats this all about you may
speak freely before my staff

 then perhaps they would be good
enough to carry the murderer of general
greer up from the basement

  half a dozen of the officers jumped at
those words

  did i hear you say the murderer of
general greer the general demanded

  g- nodded i must ask for absolute
secrecy while im risking my own life
and the lives of my assistants i cant trust
anyone until now i havent made a com-
plete report even to you but since you
demand it- he shrugged

you will find the body in the number
two storeroom in the basement i shall
make a more detailed explanation later
four officers left taking the key g-
handed them

  bull said look chief-i dont have to
play second fiddle to nippy or anybody
this time right

  right g- said and i fervently
hope that before youre through you dont
wish you hadnt taken the job you can
back out now if you want and we wont
think any the less of you

  whatever it is-ill take it

the body was brought in the four
officers laid the gigantic form on the
floor the mask still over its face

  g- didnt remove the mask he stood
over the form and nodded to bull lie
down beside him bull

  bull gulped but he stretched out on the
floor and lay still beside the dead man
he said gloomily i can imagine some
of the cracks nippy would make if he
were here

  youll have plenty to worry about be-
sides nippys cracks g- warned then
to the general youll notice sir that
this dead man is slightly larger than bull
martin all of the agents of herr goulon
that i have seen are approximately of a
 i couldnt pass for any of them

  bull looked pleading from the floor
can i get up from beside this bird now

  g- grinned and nodded you can
begin changing clothes with him any time
youre ready he turned back to the
others

  lieutenant martin will dress in the
dead mans uniform then battle will
make up his face to look like the dead
man hell return to the headquarters of
these agents work with them until he
learns what i want to know uncovers the
extent of goulons scheme bulls got to
do it because hes the only one big enough
for the job and theyd spot anyone
smaller

  the room was silent for a moment as
g- paused then the master spy added
you can see how very important it is
that the news does not leak out that this
agent has been killed it would cost my
assistants life

  the general was still frowning he said
am i to understand that you know
where these agents have their headquar-
ters

  yes sir g- said he added grimly
i hope for your sake bull that i have
their password correct as well

  the master spy bent down now and
lifted the mask off the face of the dead
murderer

  one of the staff officers a colonel said
if you know their headquarters why
dont we have our troops surround them
and either capture or annihilate them

  nothing as simple as that would net
us goulon or his agents colonel g-
said

  bull was about dressed in the beast-
mans uniform and battle went to work
on him with his make-up kit while the
yank commander and his staff officers
watched in amazement battle swiftly
transformed bull martins face from his
own into one that was identical with the
dead mans

  battle and g- cleaned the blood marks
off the uniform that bull now wore the
bullet-holes were made to look like tears
which bull could easily explain then the
master spy surveyed bull and nodded
with satisfaction

  i think youll do perfectly

  bull felt not a little uncomfortable hed
worked with g- long enough to have
the wings of the iron claw



learned all about impersonations but
now that he was on his own at last he
wasnt too sure his german wasnt per-
fect but he didnt say anything

  theres a mirror in my private office
the yank general said

  bull went in and some of the others
followed him he got a shock when he
looked at himself then he shook himself
and asked got any idea what my name
is

  you seem to be a number only g-
said here are your identification pa-
pers i took them from the pocket of the
agent shortly after i shot him youre
number one hundred and thirteen
bull winced holy herring couldnt
i have a number without a thirteen in it 
g- said look at what number thir-
teen on nippys spad has done for him
it hasnt done as much for him as it
has for me bull argued look where
i am now a german agent that doesnt
speak good german with a number thir-
teen tacked onto me

  well as i said g- reminded him
you can quit now and ill tr to get
someone else at intelligence headquarters
who can fill the bill

  bull shook his head ill stay with it
he said when do i start

  as soon as youre ready

  lets go

  the yank general held out his hand
the best of luck martin

  the staff colonel stepped up and held
out his hand

  good fighting martin

another officer of the staff and then
another stepped up and shook hands
with bull big bull martins legs got a

little shaky this was a little like being
sent to the gallows his big fists clenched
and opened slowly and he felt suddenly
anxious to be going

  g- battle and he left together out-
side g- said to battle you go back
and tell nippy whats been going on keep
track of things until i get back

  it was dark outside bull and g-
climbed into the roadster and g- drove
swiftly through the darkened streets of
paris

  now that they were rolling along g-
gave him last-minute instructions

  i dont know what youll meet after
you lift that round metal door at the base
of the statue and start down from there
on its up to you i did get what i hope
is the correct password the only thing
is i didnt hear it very clearly you may
have to bluff try mumbling it-gefang-

en

  bull repeated it then tried the word
several times with variations until he
satisfied g-

  afterwards they drove in silence until
bull asked am i supposed to speak
german

  that worried him most

  youll have to use your own judg-
ment g- said dont speak german
any more than you feel is absolutely neces-
sary

  bull pulled the metal claws over his
hands and fists it was like wearing brass
knuckles except that instead of a metal
ridge across the back of the hands there
were those murderous three-pronged tal-
ons sharp as razors on the inside the
claws extended only an inch or so beyond
the fist so that in punching if you brought
the fists slightly downward as a blow was
struck the claws would rip an antagonists
flesh

  boy bull growled trying to relieve
his tension i cant wait until i get going
among those heinies with these things
ive always wanted a fist fight with them-
only this ought to be better

  thats something you must not do un-
less you have to g- said remember
youre one of their agents youre report-
ing back after killing general greer you
can explain your delay by saying you
were pursued get along with them as
long as you can


g- an his battle aces

  okay bull nodded gloomily just
let me forget that thirteen stuff as long
as possible

  the car stopped and they got out g-
led bull through the blackness of the
night past the open spaces in the park and
then through the thickly-grown darker
area about the old statue of la bareau

  from where they crouched in the thick-
ness of the shrubbery they could just make
out the statue and the round metal door
in the base g- pointed to it and whis-
pered

  theres the statue and theres the door
i examined it when i was here earlier
and it doesnt seem too complicated i
couldnt try it out of course but if you
slip a finger or two into the hole in the
door and lift it that ought to do when
youve got all the dope you think you
can get report back to le bourget well
be waiting for you

  right bull said through tight lips
  and all the luck in the world

  bull felt the reassuring slap of the
master spys hand on his back as he
started across the short open space head-
ing for that metal door below la bareaus
statue

chapter nine

den of the death-deaiers

bull was careful to emerge from
the shrubbery where a path cut
through it in this way he would
appear to have been hurrying down the
path to keep a belated rendezvous with
his murderous colleagues

  now more than at any other time in
his life bull felt that he had to make
good the stakes were enormous but
even more than that he wanted to justify
g-s faith in him

  he felt a chill run up his spine and
fairly curl the short hair at the back of
his neck as he strode across the small open
space beside the monument this was
the last of freedom-it might be the last
of him a few more moments and he
would be one of the beast-men one of a
killer pack engaged in the most ghoulish
scheme ever devised a few more steps-
and there would be no turning back   
he didnt hesitate

  striding across those few yards of grass
he tried to keep his heart from pounding
he seemed to be able to hear it like a
deep drum that must be audible to any-
one within a hundred feet he must relax
and be ready to take anything that came
with calm and a cool head-

  he reached the monument he paused
for a split second beside the iron door
then bending down he found a hole large
enough for two fingers to probe through
he lifted it straightening

  the door opened with surprising ease
he stuck one foot down and found the
rung of a ladder and then another he
descended into a pocket that was as black
as the bottom of a deep well at midnight

  he couldnt see he only knew that he
was going down this ladder that he must
keep going down he let the iron trap
door close above him his hands felt the
rungs of the ladder now he tried to lis-
ten tried with all his senses to get some
warning of what lay below but there was
only darkness-and silence

  the space around him smelled musty
like an underground room that suffered
from poor ventilation he kept going
down he thought he had descended for
the space of minutes and still there was
no telling how far down he still had to go

  suddenly his feet touched a stone floor
he released his hold on the ladder and
stepped back

  there was a blinding flash before his
eyes bull darted back he had those
ghastly claw knuckles in his pocket g-
had told him to keep them off while he
entered the secret chambers as the others
had done now he wished that he had
them on-and then he thought of his
bare fists theyd served him well before

  he waited

  this flash stayed on at first it com-
pletely blinded him

  a voice behind the tight spoke deep and
rasping

  so-you are late

  ja bull said after i carried out
my mission the guards had me cornered
in a cellar on the rear street i waited
until they gave up the search i am
sorry

  his own voice delivering the carefully
thought out speech sounded strange to
bull martin he would much rather have
the wings of the iron claw



waded in with his great sledge-hammer
fists flying deception wasnt his forte-
yet he seemed to pass muster

  give the password

  bull coughed and spoke simultaneously
  gefangen-

  for an instant there was no response
from the man behind the light a second
seemed like a month then suddenly
the light went out and the voice in the
darkness said

  go on here bull felt a heavy body
beside him and then his left arm was
seized and his hand placed on the rocky
wall beside him follow the wall and
turn in at the first door you remember
of course

sometimes the stone paving was
rough at other times it was smooth
he heard a slight gurgling sound beside
him off to the right that might be an
underground stream flowing through this
passage then he remembered the sewers
of paris-his memory jogged by a mix-
ture of odors

  queer though that the sewer should
pass directly under that statue of la
bareau in the park but now that he
thought of it perhaps it had been planned
this way when it was built he was try-
ing to think who la bareau was he
never had heard of him it might be that
this whole thing had been a secret un-

derground passage for crooked work of
some kind built and engineered along
with the other sewers of paris by some
scheming paris politicians hed heard
plenty about french politics

  he had walked cautiously for over a
hundred yards the passage had turned
and twisted a little in its course no sign
of a door or of the end of the passage
that was funny-why should he expect
an end to the passage if this was part
of the paris sewers they all ran pretty
much into one another-a network of
drainage canals

  suddenly as he considered that his
left hand touched a vacant space in the
left wall and at the same time his right
hand which he had been holding extended
before him touched a hard wall that
blocked him ahead

  he paused here and stood peering
around in the blackness that enveloped
him he blinked his eyes closed held
them shut tightly for a long moment and
then opened them again it was as though
he were totally blind he couldnt see a
lhing-r-yes now he could that space on
the left where his hand had touched noth-
ing so suddenly a tiny streak of light
was now spraying across the floor as if
through a narrow crack under a door

  even that infinitesimally small ray of
light showed him many things he could
see the passage ending here in a solid

 hey--no i not me f

rough stuff

ju star blades


g- and his battle aces

wall of masonry beside the path where
he had been walking something like an
old tow path beside a canal ran the trick-
ling stream of drainage water in a lower
depression walled with stone

  the ceiling wasnt much higher than
his head the door was heavy and
seemed to be made of wood he reached
out and touched it and his hand came back
quickly in a little surprise the door was
cold and clammy like the wall it wasnt
wood at all-the door was a block of stone

   it opened by itself and the light inside
a dim electric torch held in the hand of
a guard larger than bull martin showed
him a small room like an entrance hall-
way

  the light flashed full in his face as the
first had done but this time it was not
so blinding

  you are late one hundred and thir-
teen

  bull opened his mouth to explain as
he had done before but the guard chopped
off his words the password

   gefangen

  the flashlight beam turned and the man
led the way to the door ten feet away
across the reception room

  that door opened before their advance
and they entered a large underground
room lighted by candles set in niches
around the walls shoulder high

  around the walls of the room were
bunks all of them empty eighteen men
were gathered about a huge table in the
center of the room each of them as large
as bull martin

  but there was one thing that took all
of bulls attention-the large table was
piled full of food there was a great plat-
ter high with chicken sections another
platter held french fried potatoes and
still another platter held vegetables a
great bowl that was going the round was
now only half full of well-browned chick-
en gravy

  another thing that bull martin saw at
that table was one vacant space at the
bench to the right

  men called to him from about the
table

  you almost lost out on supper one

said

  better eat while there is food left

  that came from perhaps the smallest

of the men about the table an ugly-faced
fellow just about bulls size

bull moved over to the vacant place
on the bench and began filling the
plate before him he took three sections
of chicken two legs and a breast mashed
two potatoes and smothered them with
gravy and dipped deep into the dish of
vegetables

  if he didnt feel at home in any other
way here he could hold his own at eating

  the biggest ugliest brute at the far
end of the table glared down to where
bull sat

  i shall expect your report and a de-
tailed explanation of your delay in joining
us he said

  he had a booming voice that echoed
throughout the room

  bull chewed savagely at his mouthful
of potatoes and chicken gravy he nodded
and grunted jawohl

he kept silent eating and listening
there was plenty of conversation going
on about him the beast-man across the
table was explaining to the one beside him

  this grandfather of mine was a sharp
fellow the brute had a french accent
he was the biggest rascal in paris and
so it was that he charles la bareau had
the monument erected to himself-at his
expense it gave him the opportunity to
have this hiding place built below it
his neighbor nodded very clever
fellow

  the speaker laughed yes my grand-
father knew that some time the law might
catch up to him so he was ready when
the time came

  and did the law ever catch him
they tried the grandson said they
tried very hard but grandfather had stores
of food put up down here and so he
came and lost himself here for some weeks
and the law forgot him until one evening
he came out and was walking about the
park tliat he had had his crooked poli-
ticians build for him with his monument
and someone saw and recognized him
walking in the park and reported him
did they catch him

  no the other laughed he stepped
behind the monument and was gone lock-
ing the iron door on the inside all the
police of paris combed the whole park
the wings of the iron claw



and this portion of the city but while
they were searching the park my grand-
father escaped through the secret way
he had left open

  bull pricked up his ears

  the head brute at the end of the table
glowered at the speaker but the latter
went on babbling

  you see it was necessary for my
grandfather to have a way to bring in air
to breathe so he had a shaft built there
at the corner of the room the speaker
pointed bull turned as did the others

  it is behind that jutting rock in the
top of the wall close to the ceiling the
grandson said the shaft is large enough
for a large man to crawl through about
a hundred yards from here it leads into
the ventilator that serves the old chamber
of deputies they say my grandfather
could sit here when the deputies were in
session and hear all of their secret con-
versations and when they were not in
session he could crawl through the pas-
sage and out through the chamber without
anyones knowing

  bull was still eating when the man at
the head of the table got up and nodded
to him imperiously

  i will have your report now he said
he turned toward another door opening
into a smaller room

  one moment bitte bull said and
went on eating and listening but the
grandson of la bareau had finished and
the others didnt talk about anything but
the ghastly jobs they had just done they
laughed and roared telling of the fearful
expressions on their victims faces as they
killed it took the rest of bulls appetite
away and he got up in disgust and went
into the smaller room where the leader
was waiting for him

  the leader was seated behind a desk
there were several pairs of the claw
knuckles on the desk top at his right he
nodded to bull and now bull noticed that
those deep-sunk eyes of the brute leader
were following his every move

  shut the door said the leader

  bull turned and closed the heavy wood
door he had a sudden feeling of being
trapped a prisoner his heart began
pounding again as it had when he had
first entered these dark underground
chambers

chapter ten
trapped

the leader had not taken his
eyes from bull since the latter had
entered the room he seemed to be
staring through him now it seemed to
bull that he must be able to see through
the make-up

  the leader spoke as i told you when
you left you were given perhaps the two
most important assignments tonight
bull struggled to follow the big mans
german

  was that two he had said bull
knew of the job of killing general greer
but he didnt know about the other

  he tried to relax and let things ride as
far as he could

  there was no other chair in the room
except the one that the leader occupied
behind the desk bull was standing before
him he hoped he wasnt showing the
uncertainty he felt frantically he tried
to figure what the other job might be

  of course herr goulon considers the
killing of major bradley as most impor-
tant but that is his fanatical mind work-
ing now you took time enough to do
what you had to do you should have
been successful

  bull nodded jazvohl and then in
english i was successful with one the
other was not there and i could not carry
out his execution

  the leader glared at him you failed
hardly that bull said i shall get
him  tomorrow night he will be back
by then

  the leaders face was growing purple
  whom are you talking about 

  bull tried a bluff i killed of course
the surgeon general greer that was
simple then the guards drove me into
a house on the back street and i had to
hide for a long time deep in the cellar

 yv


g- and his battle aces

before at last they gave up the search
the leader was breathing heavily
you mean you missed the principal
victim you were sent for

  bull was stalling desperately for time
and information

  he said how could i get at him if
he was not there

  but he must have been there the
leader snarled he couldnt help but be
there hinnnelkreusdonnerwetter the
general greer would not have been at the
office without the other

  i am sorry bull said holding his
temper in check but that is the way it
happened i believe that the great com-
mander had left general greer in charge
of his office for the night

  that was taking a chance-but there
was no change in the leaders expression
the other was as angry as before and no
more surprised that was it bull de-
cided he had been sent to get his com-
mander as well as general greer num-
ber one hundred and thirteen whom
bull tried to impersonate was to have ac-
complished both of those jobs

  the leader glared at him more sharply
why do you speak in english instead
of german he demanded

  bulls brain was working frantically
again

  i must practice my english he said
he watched to see what effect that state-
ment had the leader seemed puzzled

  if i do not speak english i might
lapse into german while on a mission

  a peculiar expression crossed the lead-
ers face it was a look of doubt uncer-
tainty almost suspicion bull couldnt
completely fathom it

  what do you think herr goulon will
say when we report to him at grossvalla
that you have failed to get the american
commander 

  im sorry bull said but hell have
to wait until i can get at him and while
that name grossvalla was sinking in
bull asked further will we be going
back there soon

the leader looked at him sharply
what should worry you is will you
ever be going there again he snarled
rising his hand went for his luger and
he stepped out from behind the desk

  bull stepped back he had no automa-

tic he only had those gouging knuckles
of his in his pocket but there wasnt time
for those-and he didnt want to use them
anyway his bare knuckles were itching
for the feel of the others chin-in spite
of his words to g- earlier he was a
fighter not a murderer

  the leader was speaking spitting out
his german words through his clenched
teeth i am sure now you are not one
hundred and thirteen you do not have
his voice besides he spoke perfect
english there was no reason to prac-
tice

  he came around the end of the desk
menacing bull with his luger bulls eyes
flashed as he waited unmoving

  then a break came the leader in mov-
ing close to the edge of the desk touched
a penholder with his elbow and knocked
it to the floor instinctively the others
eyes flashed toward the sound-and into
bulls mind came a flashing memory of
the field-carrying punts of his football
days the feel the power the accuracy
were still all there guiding his toe   

  it caught the larger mans wrist with
paralyzing force the luger flew from
the leaders grasp

  bull made a frantic effort to catch the
gun but it flew to the corner of the room
bull lunged forward his left lashed
straight out in a jab to the leaders mid-
dle pain shot up his arm at the contact
the other man too was in excellent con-
dition hard and muscular bull brought
one up from his knees   

  that too connected the eyes of the
huge leader glazed but he was far from
knocked out he staggered forward
flailing great arms and fists but this was
a silent fight now-that first blow hadnt
left the german enough wind for a yell
he snatched a handful of the claw-knuc-
kles from the desk top

  bull ducked and leaped away he was
finished if one of those claws got him
one sweep would tear any mans face off

  bull bent low and came up with the
luger in his hand the leader lunged in
jammed bull into the corner and struck
with all his might

  somehow bull managed to slip that
punch and the others fist crashed into the
stone wall behind bull

  bull martin struck with the luger
the wings of the iron claw



aiming at the brute leaders head he put
all his strength into the blow and brought
the luger down hard

  there was a crunching sound that he
hoped didnt carry through the closed door
into the other room the big leader reeled
and bull caught him before he fell

  he carried the leader over behind the
desk and stretched him out on the floor
where he wouldnt be seen through a
casually opened door the big man moved
it might have been a posthumous convul-
sive reaction-or maybe the other was
still alive no need to take unnecessary
chances

  bull raised the luger and struck again
that blow was a definite coup de grace-
the huge body stretched out and lay still

  bull got up he slipped the luger into
his pocket and surveyed the little room

  he picked up the penholder that had
tipped over on the floor straightened the
papers on the desk everything must be
left so that if anyone peered through the
door when bull went out they wouldnt
be suspicious

  bull couldnt help feeling that he was
doomed even though he had finished off
the leader if the leader had realized that
he was not one hundred and thirteen
then surely some of the others who had
worked with the original murderer would
notice differences and become suspicious

  he waited inside the door listening
trying to think he could hear voices
outside through the door he couldnt
tell what they were saying he couldnt
hear many words directly not enough to
make sense the door kept out the sound
pretty well from both sides

  for a long time bull stood there at the
door listening the voices seemed to grow
a little louder as though the men were
calling to each other across the big room-
that might mean that the men were in
their bunks most of them at least-and
that would solve another problem

  if he could wait until they were all
settled    his bunk would be empty and
he could sneak in

  while he waited bull began going
through the desk drawers he found cer-
tain papers that he glanced over there
were addresses-perhaps of other units of
these murderers addresses of houses and
headquarters in other towns and cities in

france he noted one thing in many
cases they were near some large well-
known hospitals

  this was something then that he had
come for g- must have these things
his job now would be to get the informa-
tion to g-s as quickly as possible

  he sorted out what papers he wanted to
take slipped them into his pocket and
turned for the door hed have to make
the break sometime might as well be
now

  opening the door part-way bull said
in his deep voice jawohl and stepping
out closed the door behind him

  he turned and looked into the silent
waiting questioning faces of the men ly-
ing in their bunks

chapter eleven

curtain of fire

along tense moment dragged by
bull had to make up his mind
whether to say anything at all and
to try and locate the bunk where number
one hundred and thirteen was supposed
to sleep

  he saw a vacant bunk started toward
it the tension broke a little as he walked
across the room the brute lying on the
bunk next to his grinned a horrible grin
and asked did the leader give you a
bawling out

  bull nodded and leaning low whispered
he hoped the whisper would take care of
any variations in his voice from that of the
man he represented

  dont remind me of it he hissed i
was lucky to get out alive he winked
and cast a furtive glance at the closed
door that hid the dead leader

  the man he had spoken to chuckled in
a deep rumbling voice he seemed satis-
fied even happy bull felt rather proud of
himself it had been a stroke of sheer
genius he felt to have intimated the
leader was furious-it would postpone dis-
covery of the body

  the men in their bunks began to quiet
down there seemed to be no further
cause for worry at the moment

  from where he lay bull glanced across
the room at the ventilator that the grand-
son of la bareau had mentioned at the


g- and his battle aces

table by climbing up on the top bunk
bull would be able to reach that secret
exit

  against that chance he considered try-
ing to leave by the way he had come in
it seemed that none of the men here in
their bunks would be leaving these at-
tacks had been made pretty much en
masse   

  he lay still in his bunk pretending to
be asleep and listened to the heavy snor-
ing of first one and then another of his
bunkmates he wondered if these two
guards with their lights were still on duty
he hadnt seen them come in and join the
others since he had first entered the under-
ground chamber

  for a long time he lay still with eyes
closed all of the others were sleeping in
their various uniforms which ranged
through british french and yank

  it seemed to bull that at least an hour
passed then one ugly bird raised his head
and glanced at the closed door to the
leaders inner office he glanced at bull
after that and then settled back again bull
lay there one eye cocked on the fellow
for a long time when he finally saw the
brutes chest heaving in heavy slumber
he slipped from his bunk and moved across
the room to the other corner

  that rock that jutted out so la
bareaus grandson had said hid the en-
trance to the ventilator and the secret
escape

  bull scarcely paused below the rock
he stepped on the edge of the lower bunk
putting his weight on it gingerly and then
to the upper bunk there was a slight
creak but now was no time to stop

  he drew himself up on the overhanging
shelf rock and there was the opening with
a gentle blast of air coming through it he
didnt hesitate-his head and shoulders
went through the opening and then he
began crawling through the low tunnel
that had seemingly been cut out of solid
rock

  crawling as fast as he could he had
gone perhaps ten yards through the tunnel
when a warning voice came to him the
sound came from behind back there at the
entrance to the ventilator tunnel but it
didnt stop him it only spurred him on to
faster motion

  halt the voice bellowed again

what are you doing crawling away
through the secret passage

  bull turned and called back i am
leaving on an urgent mission i failed to
accomplish one half of my mission and
im going to finish the job tonight

  he kept crawling the others voice
came to him again

  ach

  he didnt know what that meant

  bull began moving faster and faster
but he seemed to be traveling at the pace
of a turtle he felt like one too-a turtle
helpless on its back its main defensive
strength gone

  he began to wonder now if this really
did lead as the brute had said to the old
chamber of deputies room in a building
across from the park and if it did and
he were discovered what would he say

  not nearly enough of the tunnel had he
put behind him when he heard the tumult
of voices at the rear end briefly there
was noisy confusion-then a gun barked
and the noise echoing in the tunnel made
his ears ring

  he heard the bullet ricochet from one
wall of the tunnel to another but there
were too many turns behind him the
bullet stopped before it reached him

as he crawled on he felt for the pa-
pers in his pocket yes they were
there he could hear excited bellowing
voices behind him

  donnenvetter look the leader has
been killed

  stop that one who escaped

  i thought he did not sound like one
thirteen

  stop him

  let me crawl after him i can crawl
fast

  let me get my claws on him i will
tear the meat off his bones

  the voices snarling and confident
spurred bull on his way

  he was going through contortions he
had never tried before the beast-inen
were coming after him through the tunnel
like a pack of bloodthirsty wolves

  he hadnt crawled a half mile he felt
sure of one thing those birds pursuing
him hadnt gained on him they were still
pretty well back and if he could only find
a way of stopping them-
the wings of the iron claw



  he came out of the rock tunnel into a
metal ventilator almost large enough to
stand in and a thought struck him the
air was still flowing against him back into
the tunnel now feeling about in the dark-
ness he found hooks in the side of the
ventilator by which he could climb up

  but first he must stop his pursuers or
at least hinder them he moved on as
fast as he could climb fairly running up
the metal ventilator if he found what he
wanted when he got to the top he might
be okay

  at the top of the climb the square
metal tube he was in leveled and he had
to crawl again the air still kept blowing
in his face he crept perhaps a hundred
feet or more and then brought up against
a grill he seized it with his hands found
that it lifted out quite easily he emerged
in a very large room

  heavy drapes were drawn back at the
windows and the light from dim street
lamps filtered in through leaded glass he
grinned as he snatched one and then an-
other of the heavy plush drapes and
bunched them loosely just inside the venti-
lator

  he struck a match and touched off the
drapes they didnt burn easily but the
breeze that carried through the old venti-
lating system fanned the smoldering mass
of plush to smoky flame

  dense smoke poured from that bundle
of burning cloth the smoke billowed into
the ventilator bull tore down another
heavy drape and piled that on the fire and
for luck he added another

  the smudge was going furiously
through the ventilator he could hear
choking and coughing and cursing he
grinned

  he whirled now and made for the heavy
door it was locked bull tried it with his
shoulder and it was like bucking a stone
wall

  he found a switch and turned on the
lights a great chandelier gleamed and
glistened from the high ceiling

  the coughing and choking continued to
come through the ventilator a little of
the smoke was escaping into the room
bull kicked the smoldering mass farther

into the tunnel and it fairly roared as the
draft fanned it but the choking and
coughing was coming closer

  bull rushed for the leaded glass win-
dows they were built solid and except
for a very small section at the bottom they
had no movable parts bull threw that
open and peered down he was too far up
to jump

  bull spun round and saw the telephone
on the great desk in the corner he might
be able to call g- from there it was
worth a try to get his information through
before his pursuers got to him he made
a leap for the instrument

  he gave the number of le bourget
field this is urgent get that number at
once and send the police and intelligence
to the old chamber of deputies

   oui monsieur

  and then g-s voice spoke at the other
end

  bull had the papers out before him
get all this down g- ive crawled
through to the old chamber of deputies
across from the park ive got all the dope
you want but im locked in here and
theyre coming after me write these
things down

  okay good boy go ahead
grossvalla seems to be a place where
herr goulon has his headquarters bull
said i dont know any more than that
now for the other branches of these gou-
lon agencies here are the addresses
he read first from one list and then
another address after address the
sounds of pursuit were coming nearer
bull couldnt understand how the beast-
men could fight their way through that
mass of pouring smoke to get through and
up and over the ventilator but they were
doing it coughing and cursing they were
coming to get him and there didnt seem
to be anything he could do to stop them

war bonds are war weapons-top that 


g- and his battle aces

he must above everything else get his
information out

  reading as fast as he could he hurried
on there was a sort of explosion at the
entrance to the ventilator and bull saw the
first of the beast-men come charging
through the burning mass

  it was the grandson of la bareau he
made a lunge for bull clear across the
room

  but bull still had the luger he shot
without pausing in his reading hardly
changing the tone of his voice

  the lunging brute clutched at his heart
in a convulsed move and went down plow-
ing his face into the thick rug he shud-
dered and lay still

  another pursuer was climbing from the
ventilator he took time to kick the smol-
dering drapes into the room before he
started for bull

  bull fired again the fellow reeled and
came on it took another slug to finish
him

  more came and bull kept firing with
cold accuracy

  he heard g-s voice raised in startled
query and- snapped back get these last
names and addresses

  he went on reading and another beast
came crashing from the ventilator and fell
dead in his tracks as bull cut loose with
the luger

  then bull gripped the phone tighter
the last time he had pulled the trigger
nothing happened he barked into the
mouthpiece

  got to go now a little business-

  the last brute that he had failed to get
was coming at him bull sailed into him
bare fists swinging he threw a left jab
and then stepped in slipped a right to the
jaw and countered with a pretty right hook
that spun the beasts head half round on
his thick neck

  his first victim was going down but the
others came tearing at bull they spread
out surrounding him

  bull got the first one with a left hook
and whirling lashed out with his right
to the jaw of the other he missed then
something leaped behind him and there
were stars and flashes and then blackness
blacker even than the underground cav-
erns he had left

  bull martin knew nothing more

chapter twelve

master-web

when the master spy heard the
first of the shots over the phone
he barked a command to nippy
and battle who were still in their beds

  get up both of you bulls in trouble

  that was enough for either of them
before bulls last words came over the
phone nippy and battle were standing
beside their chief ready for action

  g- himself was in his pajamas he left
the phone and plunged into his room get
dressed nippy youre going down with
me you battle call intelligence tell
them to get to the old chamber of depu-
ties at once tell them to go thoroughly
armed 

  in little more than two minutes g-
was dressed he ran to the living room
battle was telephoning intelligence he
finished just as g- came to him

  here g- said take these names
and addresses and telephone them to au-
thorities nearest to each

  yes sir

  g- flipped his colt automatic in his
hand cocked back the barrel slide and put
on the safety she was loaded and ready
except for a swift movement of his thumb
and finger to fire it safety off and trigger
on that would be all and he could begin
to kill

  nippy was ready his colt ready for
action they charged out into the storage
end of the hangar together and g- leaped
behind the wheel of his roadster they
shot up to the dark highway and headed
toward paris

  as he drove g- told nippy what he
knew about bull

  theres a bird who really did a swell
job g- said he had a list of every
place where goulons agents might be i
havent the slightest idea where or how
he got it but he got it

  bull always comes through in the
pinches nippy said if he hasnt tried
to lick the whole german army single-
handed he may be okay by now

  they took corners on two wheels
grazed sleepy gendarmes and went charg-
ing on toward that queer little park

  what i cant figure out is what bulls

doing in the old chamber of deputies
building nippy said

  he didnt take any time to talk about
himself g- said tensely we may find
out a lot of things thatll surprise us

  i sure hope we get there in time to
find the big guy alive nippy said

  even as he spoke the roadster was
drawing up before the old chamber of
deputies then they were out of the car
and running up the wide steps there
were heavy doors on the outside and they
were locked the whole building seemed
to be shut off from the rest of paris ex-
cept for the lights shining from two great
windows two stories up and to the left
they were long high windows of leaded
glass and through the many panes of glass
nippy and g- could see the glitter of
lights from a crystal chandelier

there was a blasting sound as g-s
colt exploded the lock the door thun-
dered and he put his shoulder against it
and pushed the door gave way and they
rushed inside

  he found a switch and turned on the
light stairs wide and ornamental led up
from the main hall

  they ran up the long flight

  reaching the main chambers they
paused this door too was locked this
was a solid lock that could not be shot off

  there was a bedlam of voices below and
then the pounding of running feet turn-
ing g- saw men coming up some were
dressed in civilian clothes and others were
in american uniform

  he recognized various agents from in-
telligence

  the little man l- seemed to be in
charge he said well we meet again
g- what seems to be the trouble
lets get this door open g- said
caustically and well see

  one of the other agents produced a ring
of keys and long moments passed while
he tested the lock

  g- his anxiety for bulls safety grow-
ing with the delay demanded what took
you so long nippy and i started from
le bourget after battle called you and
were here ahead of you

  it took some time to round up these
agents l- snapped

  nippy cut in wrathfully with maybe

we shouldnt have bothered you you sure
brought a gang-sort of too late with too
many

  never mind g- said

  he was the first to step into the great
hall after the door was unlocked he went
inside and stopped while the others crowd-
ed after him-and stopped to stare

  ugly-lookingbrutes lay in a great heap
in the far corner of the room some of
the furniture was tipped over the place
smelled like a smudge pot

  burning rags nippy said

  both he and g- were walking among
the fallen figures looking at their faces
one by one

  i dont even know what bull looked
like when battle was through with him
nippy said

  g- went on searching silently

  there were eight dead brutes lying in
that heap near the open ventilator a ninth
lay in the middle of the floor his face
puffed

  g- stopped by him and bent down he
came up presently and nodded to nippy
get some water this bird was knocked
out the others were shot dead most of
them through the heart

  while nippy was out getting the water
g- yanked down one of the curtain cords
and tied it loosely about the neck of the
unconscious beast-man he tossed the
other end of the cord over a part of the
chandelier

  you cant hang a- l- began in
startlement

  g- didnt answer

  nippy came with the water and g-
tossed it into the beasts face for a long
moment it seemed that the water was
going to have no effect on him then the
eyelids fluttered and in another moment
his eyes opened

  the terrier ace came back to g-s side
any sign of bull

  bulls not here g- said but may-
be this buzzard can tell us what happened
to him

  the brutes little eyes were wide open
and flashing dazedly about the room he
lifted one hand and rubbed his jaw

 ach himmelhe said what a
punch-

  the man frowned stared about him
his lips closed and he shook his head he
the wings of the iron claw



 wasnt going to talk that was quite
 plain

 g- leaned forward a little put your
 hand to your neck he said in gentian

 the fellow went a little white as his
 hand touched the rope g- nodded to the
 agents of l- maybe hed like to be
 helped up he doesnt seem happy where
 he is

 the german clutched the rope i-ill
 talk he choked jawohl ill talk
 what happened to the one who was
 telephoning when you came in

 the german turned his head slowly
 looking about the room all dead he
 said seeing the others he was a fighter
 that man

 was a fighter g- repeated
 where is he now

 i dont know the man rubbed his
 jaw again i have been unconscious
 how did you get in here g- de-
 manded

 the man pointed to the open ventilator
 with the grill torn away there he
 said that leads to our headquarters
 under the monument

 yes

 was the password gejangen g-
 asked

 the man nodded

 where are the rest of your men

 he shook his head i was uncon-
 scious

 what do you think they did with our
 friend

 the man shrugged he might be
 dead

 where

 he shrugged again and nodded to the
 ventilator maybe in the underground
 room

 how many of you were there g-
 asked

 over twenty

 where are the rest

 i dont know i was unconscious

 g- rose and nodded to the intelli-
 gence agents take the rope off his
 neck and see that hes put in a good stout
 prison

 he jerked his head to nippy were
 going through

 they checked their automatics before
 they bent down to enter the ventilator

shaft making sure they were ready for
instant action

  g- went in first and began crawling
along the metal tube of the ventilator
nippy followed close behind there was
still that faint odor of cloth burning nippy
said did you see that pile of burned
drapes at the entrance to this passage
yes g- hissed back it looks as if
bull used his head there that must have
held back those birds long enough for
him to phone

  nippy whispered wotta guy
they reached the place where the shaft
dropped down groping their way they
found the rungs in the wall and went
down and then crawled through the rest of
the metal passage into the rock-lined
tunnel

  they did no talking now if they were
to surprise anyone in the underground

chamber they must make as little noise as

possible

  ahead g- saw the ray of light illumi-
nating the area of the shaft ahead of them
nippy saw it too they were moving with
more caution listening as they went

  they could see into the ceiling of the
underground room now there was no
sound no sign of life there but they con-
tinued to use caution fearing a trap might
await them

  g- crawled out on the ledge of rock at
the end of the shaft and looked down into
the room nippy came out beside him
they saw the great table in the center
and the bunks about the sides from the
ledge of rock they could see the two


g- and his battle aces

doors one at each side of the room

  g- swung down to the edge of a
bunk and nippy came beside him there
was no sign of anyone in the room and
they moved to one of the doors g-
opened it automatic held cocked

  the leader of the brutes was still lying
behind his desk where bull had left him
they ran through the desk drawers but
bull had taken everything of value turn-
ing they strode across the room to the
other door and with guns ready they
flung it open

  they faced another small room with a
door on the far side they passed through
and then along the passage beside the
trickling drainage they came to the iron
ladder climbed to the top and out of
the iron door

  they found themselves at the base of
the monument and nippy said so this
is where you last saw bull-

  g- nodded but ive got a hunch it
wont be the last ive seen of him

  he led the way across the darkened
park back to the chamber of deputies
the intelligence agents were still there
waiting holding the captured german

  g- jerked his head put him where
hell keep

  he wants to tell you something l-
said

  yes

  you might save me from a firing squad
if i tell you this the man said

  im not making any promises g-
told him what have you got to tell
about your friend the man said
they might have taken him to herr
goulon in germany so youll come after
him and they can trap you

  where is herr goulons headquar-
ters g- asked

  the man shook his head i dont
know

  you lying- nippy snarled

  hold it nip g- said then to the
rather subdued beast-man where do you
think herr goulon is

  im telling you all i know on the
chance that youll spare my life the man
said but i was one of the newest of
the agents i have never been at herr
goulons headquarters the others men-
tioned a place called grossvalla do you
know where that is

  g- shook his head i havent the
slightest idea but im going to try and
find out

  he reached for the phone that bull had
used ill call battle and see if anything
has turned up

  is that all you want with this man
l- asked

  g- nodded you can take him now

  he gave the operator the number of
le bourget field there was no answer
the operator tried again and again

  finally she came back on the wire
monsieur the line is not busy there
is no answer are you sure monsieur
that there is someone there

  there should be someone there g-
insisted

  he didnt wait longer but hung up
and turned to nippy lets go some-
thing has happened to battle

chapter thirteen
battle

ever since g- and nippy had left
battle had been sending out g-s
message to various civil and mili-
tary authorities his task difficult to
start with was rendered more so by an
influx of calls from the very localities he
sought to contact-each of them describ-
ing further atrocities perpetrated by the
iron-clawed monsters who seemed to be
closing in for the kill the lines were
held up for minutes at a time while bat-
tle swore and fretted

  he was too busy to notice anything
about him he didnt hear the sound of
the outside door opening and closing soft-
ly behind him he did feel a slight draft
of air on the back of his neck but he
didnt bother to turn the work he was
doing was of vital importance and if he
could make the rest of the calls he would
save many lives

   suddenly he felt a presence behind him
he dropped the receiver on the hook and
spun round trying at the same time to
duck

  a brute of a man stood before him a
hideous grin on his face his fists gleam-
ing with the triple claws battles back
was to the wall the man growled
where is g- where is the other the
little one we have come for all of you
the wings of the iron claw



  the claws were ready to gouge for a
moment he was too startled to think he
tried to think to compose himself with
true british reserve he got control so
that he could say in a steady voice

  the master is out and will not be
back for at least twenty-four hours mr
weston is with him

  youre lying the brute snarled and
he ripped at him with his right fist the
claws tore the front of battles shirt and
drew blood

  battle fell back trying to evade another
slashing stroke

  another beast-man and another came
in the door they leaped on battle and
held him down then turned him over and
fastened his feet and his hands behind his
back

  the lights of the apartment were turned
out shortly after he was blindfolded and
gagged blind and unable to utter a
sound scarcely able to breathe he felt
himself carried

  he had no idea where they were taking
him but it took them a long time

  finally he was loaded into a car and
driven in that for about an hour then he
was lifted into a conveyance that set his
nerves tingling with a fierce lust for free-
dom

  the engine was idling but the strang-
est part of it was that it sounded like a
salmson engine perhaps a stolen salm-
son  

  he heard low conversation without
grasping what was said he strained to
see out from under the blindfold but the
cloth was too wide too securely tied

  he tried next to guess at the time and
how long it had taken him to get where
he was and what direction they had taken
but he found himself too hopelessly con-
fused

  he lay still in the compartment of the
fuselage where they had laid him and
presently felt the shudder of the salmson
engine in takeoff

they flew for almost an hour and then
the engine was cut and they were
landing-in germany he guessed battle
could feel the wheels and skid touch the
earth and roll to a stop

  he heard german voices loud now
the motors died and he was lifted out

there was much confusion and a bellow-
ing voice screamed you bring me every-
one but the swine that i want

  that brought no argument battle felt
cold and he couldnt help shivering he
could hear the slosh of his captors boots
in mud and then there was an exclamation
and he was going down while men about
him cursed and splashed the water was
icy

  there was more cursing and then he
was picked up again and carried on some-
one far off laughed and roared and bel-
lowed and the men who carried him
growled and cursed

  finally he was lying face down on a
very hard floor and his hands and feet
were being untied the gag was removed
and then the blindfold

  for the first time in hours he could
take a full breath his lungs filled and
after several breaths he opened his eyes

  he was jerked to his feet and saw that
two of goulons agents had hold of him
their gleaming claws bared for action

  but he saw something else as well he
was being held up before herr goulofr
himself no one could help but recognize
that maniac the red bloodshot sunken
eyes the skin on the face that was
stretched like the skin of a mummy the
gaping hole for a mouth the misshapen
hideous teeth

  so your verdammter chief thinks he
has fooled me herr goulon growled
let him not laugh too heartily we shall
have him very shortly you will write him
a message telling him where he can come
to find you he knows your handwriting
nicht wahr

  battle didnt speak for a moment his
head was spinning after his immersion in
the muddy ice-cold water these lacerations
in his chest burned like fire and his body
felt stiff

  i asked you a question swine herr
goulon bellowed he leaped up and lean-
ing over his desk raised the steel prongs
of his left hand menacingly

  battle held his composure

  youll have to pardon me battle said
i nearly choked to death with those
gags

  it is too bad for you that you did not
goulon howled

  in that case perhaps you do not wish


g- and his battle aces

me to answer any questions battle said

  battle was playing desperately for time
he couldnt see what more time was go-
ing to get him-the action was instinctive
while he could balk or delay goulons
plans he was that much ahead

  he waited now silently watching
goulon force a semblance of calm into his
distorted features

  i assume that g- knows your hand-
writing herr goulon demanded finally
more quietly than before

  i believe he would recognize my hand-
writing battle said

  good herr goulon nodded come
here

  he motioned battle to his desk

  battle walked past him dripping water
over the rug that covered the floor of the
great room

  sit down

  battle sat down

  there is ink and paper write what
 tell you to write

  battle took up the pen and dipped it
into an ink container

  herr goulon began speaking

  i am held a prisoner by herr goulon
you can help me to escape by coming
after dark to the deserted house at the
north edge of the village of greiner state
oi baden

  battle wrote the message in his careful
land and then looked up and noticed that
hrough a high narrow window daylight
vas streaming through the night had
inded and this was tomorrow

  as he signed the message for help he
realized suddenly how he could make it
a warning he could use a code that he
made up now b c would mean be
careful

  he signed the message then b c
battle

  herr goulon snatched up the message
when he had finished signing it and glared
at it

  what is this trick-these letters before
your name

  that is my name battle said i al-
ways sign my name like that my full
name is bernard cecil battle

  herr goulon looked skeptical for an
instant and then he broke out in a mirth-
less laugh what a name bernard
cecil

  he handed the note to one of his agents
see that that is placed where g- will
receive it as quickly as possible

  turning back to battle and the other
brute agents he said now take this
englishman into the dungeon and hang
him up to dry macht schnell

chapter fourteen

going through

bull martin had not the slight-
est idea how long he had been un-
conscious he became aware of
certain things about him slowly like the
jolting motion that gave him those sharp
little pains in the head he was riding-
probably in a car then he could hear the
engine purring softly

  slowly his mind moved back to where
he had become unconscious he had
emptied his gun that was it his bullets
were gone and he had been knocking them
over with his bare fists-until that final
blank moment

  the vehicle he was riding in jolted and
his head suddenly felt as though it would
split perhaps it had

  he thought of moving his hand up to
his head to see how badly damaged the
head was he moved a hand and then
stopped perhaps he was doing all right
by just staying the way he was his hands
werent tied perhaps his feet werent tied
either in that event he might be able to
do something about this when he got more
of his strength back evidently whoever
had him a prisoner had taken for granted
that he would be out cold for a long time

  he moved his feet experimentally-and
was satisfied he was curled up on the
floor of the rear of a car he could feel
the feet of a man stuck in his side

  there were patches of light and dark
flashing over his face he waited until a
dark shadow passed over and then he
cracked one eye open there was one of
the brutes dressed in a yank uniform sit-
ting in the rear seat of the car his eyes
werent on bull at his feet just now but
he might look down at any moment

  on the germans lap with his fingers
coiled around the butt was a colt auto-
matic bull got enough glimpse of the
gun to see that the beast-mans finger was
the wings of the iron claw



on the trigger and the safety was off no
chance of surprising this heinie-

  there would be others in the front seat
the driver and another

  it was daylight and the sky was murky
gray now and then the car passed under
some low-hanging trees their added
shade was making the difference between
shadow and light

  he closed his eyes again gradually his
head felt better and he began to try to
work things out in his own mind

bull decided that hed stick this out-
lie there as though unconscious and
see what would happen he wouldnt make
any sort of break until he knew the rest
of his captors plans if that was too late-
he would have done his best

  he began to try and figure where they
were taking him he tried opening his
eyes again just a slit the german was
still there on the seat with his toes partly
under bulls side in this way the ger-
man guard could tell the moment bull
moved of his own free will he had to be
particularly careful   

  a thought flashed into his mind there
was a tiny compass on the back of his
wrist watch he moved ever so slightly
until he found his wrist watch it was
there all right he couldnt help a little
shocked surprise that the germans hadnt
taken the watch away from him for them-
selves that would have been the usual
thing

  they went over a series of bumps in
the rutted road the german was bounc-
ing in the seat he turned his head to
look down at bull and bull closed his eyes
and let his body bounce around as limp

as a rag doll-and managed to slip the
watch around

  when they were on a smoother road
bull stole a look at the compass they
were heading east

  the german moved shifting his feet
without any concern for bulls comfort
bull lay still again and they rolled on
later he got a chance to glance at the com-
pass again without attracting the attention
of his guard the direction still checked

  he let it go at that and relaxed his
body was getting sore and cramped and
it took all the determination he had to
lie still

  the car came to a stop finally they
lifted him out two germans heaved him
around like a sack of meal banging him
against the sides of the car door

  another sound reached bull he heard
a liberty engine ticking neatly like a
liberty would this he thought might be
his last chance to put up a fight

  they were carrying him from the car
to the dh he cracked one eye open
enough to see the plane standing in the
field ahead perhaps two hundred feet
from where the car had stopped a slim
young chap in a french uniform said in a
low voice in german macht schnell
we have not all day herr goulon is
waiting

  the men who carried bull hurried
they lifted bulls dead weight and heaved
him into the d h cockpit one of the
beast-men got in with him and settled
down in front of him an automatic held
ready-

  the liberty engine roared and the
plane trundled along the ground and then
rode the bumpy air

  after the plane had climbed and was
on its way bull took a momentary glance
at the compass they were moving west
now that meant one tiling they were
heading either for switzerland or the
vosges mountains or the black forest

bull felt mighty proud of himself now
as he lay cramped and sore in the
cockpit with the german practically sit-
ting in his lap for once he was doing
dangerous-he almost dared to think the
clever work-while g- himself was left
to do the routine cleanup stuff after bull
told him where to go those addresses-


g- and his battle aces

hed got those off his chest and now he
stood a chance of finding goulons head-
quarters

  it was very satisfying he lay there
trying to keep track of flight-direction
and time   

  then they were coming down to land
the engine was cut and the wheels and
skid touched and then the plane rolled to
a stop for the first time he heard con-
versation

  they were lifting him out of the plane
and carrying him after a few minutes he
opened his eyes and could see a patch
of trees and a vine-covered castle in the
center of a grove it made him think of
the ancient castles he had seen pictures
of in the school books when he was
younger

  beyond he recognized the blackness of
the mountains covered by evergreens-
the dark spruces of the black forest he
guessed that he was just over the boun-
dary just east of the upper rhine coun-
try

  they carried him on seemingly with-
out fatigue these were strong men these
brutes of herr goulon his eyes were
closed again

  so far as he knew not one of these
germans knew he was conscious if he
could only fake things out he might work
something that would surprise even g-
back at the old government building hed
managed to use the telephone-maybe
there was a wireless here   

  opening his eyes again to slits he
searched for an aerial they were going
through the trees and over a thick carpet
of grass the trees hid part of the castle
roof

  then he saw the aerial it ran from
the south tower to the turret to the north
they neared the south tower now and he
tried to find the lead wire and luck was
with him

  he almost moved in his excitement at
his discover the lead wire came down
the side of the south tower over the vines
that covered the towers curves and led
in at a window about one flight up

  as he was carried into the castle a bel-
lowing voice came to him

  so we have another one das ist gut
bring him in-

  another one the words echoed in
bulls thoughts who was here already 

did this bellowing maniac mean that they
already had another one of the battle aces
-or even g- himself

  herr goulon this one has been uncon-
scious since he was knocked out in
paris

  unconscious herr goulon roared
there are ways to wake up swine

  the men who were carrying bull mar-
tin paused bull martin waited without
daring to open his eyes

  a terrific blow across the face made his
senses swim

chapter fifteen

one-way message

ever in his entire life had bull
martin been forced to keep such
tight hold of himself he wanted
to tear out of the hands of these two
brutes and break the neck of herr gou-
lon-but he knew that afterwards he
wouldnt stand a chance

  these men of herr goulon were strong
they were in many cases perhaps
stronger and more terrible than bull him-
self he might or might not get goulon
-but that would mean an end to his hopes
of contacting g- with more information

  his head reeled now and after he got
over that first insane burst of rage it
wasnt difficult to lie doggo

  he heard herr goulon saying he
does seem unconscious perhaps hes for-
tunate enough to be dead

  they carried him into another room
he heard a door opening and closing
herr goulons voice rasped put him
here on this cot

  jawohl

  bull felt the soft padding of a couch
under him and then heard herr goulons
voice again

where is the verdammter doktor

  i think he is at his office in the vil-
lage

  then go to greiner and get him
there is no use doing more until we
know whether he can be brought back to
consciousness

  jawohl

one of the men was hurrying away

  bull tried to make a mental note of all
that the castle was apparently near a
village called greiner that would serve



g- and his battle aces

to direct g- to the right spot   

  he lay there for several minutes out
in the corridor he could hear herr gou-
lons heavy tread and he could hear the
crippled brute exploding now and then in-
to fits of cursing finally goulons foot-
steps grew lighter receded

  bull opened his eyes

  one of goulons agents was still in the
room he hadnt counted on that the
brute stood like a stone statue feet firm-
ly planted on the floor his back to bull

  if he would stay that way there might
be a chance

  bull moved more on the cot and it
didnt make a sound he sat up tensed
this must be his supreme effort no
room for failure here this was it

  he slid crouching off the cot his
hand closed over an iron door-stop a pace
away from the couch he took another
step-and another-toward the back of
the german guard

  his hand raised bull leaned forward
balancing on his toes the guard sudden-
ly jerked round and bull leaped he
struck with all his might   

bull caught the body and dragged it
to the cot a door down the corridor
outside thundered shut the babbling
cursing voice of herr goulon died away

  bull laid the brute on the cot stepped
boldly into the corridor he had the door-
stop still in his hand it made a handy
weapon even if it wouldnt be a match
for the hooked claws of goulons hench-
men

  the corridor ended in a great reception
hall two of goulons guards were strid-
ing across the hall he paid no attention
to them the door-stop was well hidden
in bull martins big hand so far as he
knew his face was still made up to re-
semble number one hundred and thir-
teen

  the two germans walked across the
great hall and into the corridor from
which bull had just emerged they were
gone before bull reached the door into the
south tower

  he opened the door and stepped inside
the instant before he closed the door he
heard the screaming rasp of herr goulon

  himmelkreuzdonnerwetter where is
that guard

  bull closed the door and then locked
it from the inside but through the door
heavy as it was he continued to hear the
screaming

  where is the prisoner this dead man
on the couch is the guard find the swine
who was my prisoner

  the walls of the castle seemed to shud-
der at the screaming terrible voice bull
made sure the door was locked and ran
up the stairs that wound about the side
of the south tower

  he reached a hallway platform and
paused before a door he tried it it was
locked

  a voice inside called who is it

  a message from herr goulon bull
said in the best german he could man-
age

  the door was unlocked and swung
open the wireless operator looked at
him inquiringly listening to the distant
racket coming from the other portion of
the castle

  bull didnt waste words he swung the
weight with all his might

  there was a crash as the weight struck
the side of the wireless operators jaw

  he dragged the operator inside closed
the door and bolted it then he rushed for
the wireless set switched it over to send-
ing and began calling lebourget

  a thunderous pounding came to him
from below he kept working the key
after minutes that seemed so many life-
times he raised the field  

  there was the thunder of feet running
up the stairs it wouldnt take them long
to break down the door of the wireless
room it wasnt as heavy as the door
downstairs

  working furiously he was repeating
when with a rending crash the door of
the wireless room burst inward

chapter sixteen

gross vail a

back in paris g- and nippy lost
no time in getting to the roadster
after finding that battle did not
answer the phone at le bourget

  again g- was behind the wheel
there was a tense expression on his face
he leaned forward over the wheel and
the wings of the iron claw



pushed the foot accelerator to the floor

  nippy asked what do you suppose
has happened to him

  what happened to bull g- asked
you tell me that and ill answer your
question

 do you think herr goulon has
them 

  i dont think theyre being presented
at court in london

  the car went racing on at top speed
through the streets of paris the city
was pretty well deserted at this early
morning hour there were some vege-
table and fruit vendors on the streets
heading for the market-small farmers
who had come in the middle of night from
their little farms surrounding the great
french capital they came in all sorts
of vehicles dog carts and single horse-
drawn wagons and here and there a snort-
ing little old farm truck

  g- sent the roadster careening around
these vehicles and went charging out into
the suburbs of paris and on toward le
bourget

  he pulled up short at the gate

  nippy said look there isnt a light
in the place

  a guard came forward and g- asked
a question

  the guard shook his head no sir
there hasnt been anyone around
when did you come on duty g-
asked

  about three hours ago

  and you saw nothing around the end
hangar

  i havent seen anything stirring any-
where about the field except a couple of
authorized planes taking off down the field
the commander phoned that they would
be leaving tonight

  two planes

  yes sir

  g- drove on into the storage end of
the hangar and got out he and nippy
hurried into the apartment and switched
on the light

  no sign of a fight here nippy said
g- nodded they must have taken
battle without a struggle

  how do you know they took battle
nippy ventured maybe he finished his
calling and went out

  battle wouldnt do that

  g- began making a hasty inspection of
the various rooms battle was nowhere
he came back and met nippy in the liv-
ing room

  battles gone g- said and what
is almost worse weve lost that list bull
got us

  jumping jupiter you mean after
bull may have got himself killed getting
that information-now its gone

  g- nodded he sat down by the library
table drumming his fingers restlessly
then he seized a pencil and began writ-
ing he wrote a single word gross-
valla he stopped and thought and then
he wrote something else and getting up
went to the phone soon he was talking
to someone at the other end

  oui monsieur the voice at the other
end said we were called by your man
we went to the address but found that the
agents have already left i am sorry we
were late monsieur

  thanks g- hung up

  he turned to nippy that number
is the only one i can remember from that
list of bulls he said

  what about this grossvalla
thats the name of the place where
bull said herr goulon is supposed to
have his headquarters

  whats it mean nippy asked i
know that gross means great but what
about valla something to do with val-
halla

said think it over theres a set of
books over there it might be in that

g- and his battle aces

he pointed to the bookshelf and lifted
the receiver from the hook again he
called the french commander of le bour-
get field and asked about those two
planes that had taken off in the dark the
commander reported satisfactorily on
those they were a couple of pursuits
from other fields two french command-
ers from tow other pursuit fields had
flown over for a visit they had stayed
late that was all

  g- made another tour of the apart-
ment

  nippy yawned presently and g-
nodded

  there doesnt seem to be much we
can do about this now he said lets
get a little sleep and well do better when
we wake up

  nippy nodded i sure can do with
some sleep if i can get any

  you arent apt to do bull and battle
any good by keeping awake

they turned in but as dawn broke in
the east g- was up again out of
that short sleep had come an idea the
name grossvalla still bothered him he
felt it should carry some meaning-like
a story long forgotten

  he tried to think where he had heard
it while he shaved and washed he strug-
gled with the ideas without being able
to grasp the right one there must be
something historical about it-like hei-
delberg-and the blarney stone-
finally he went to the phone and put
in a call to the operator he said id
like to have you get me the head professor
of the history department of the universi-
ty of paris

  the call came through the professor
sounded sleepy der grossvalla yes
there is something about it in european
history let me see if i can recall it
monsieurafter a while he said the
legend tells of der grossvalla as a great
series of chambers in the bowels of the
earth where the devils pause for rest on
their way from hades i doubt if there is
anything here to help you it is for the
most part a childish fairy tale

  but the main story of what and where
der grossvalla is-or was g- insisted
there must be something more definite
than that

  to be sure monsieur the professor
said these legends are german there-
fore we assume that if there ever was
such a place it must be in germany but
there is not the slightest indication of
where it might be

  i have information g- went on
that the modern grossvalla is the head-
quarters of a man were desperately
anxious to find-a monster  he went
on to explain in some detail

  one minute please monsieur the
professor said and then when he came
back i find nothing more than what i
have already told you der grossvalla
was supposed to be a resting place for
the devils who came to tonnent the peo-
ple on the surface of the earth it was the
belief then that the fiery hades was in
the middle of the earth der grossvalla
was the great chambers between the mid-
dle of the earth and the surface where
the devils stopped on their way to rest
then they might be a great series of
caves g- suggested

  that is possible monsieur the pro-
fessor admitted that is very possible
to be sure

  do you know of any such series of
caverns

  there are plenty of caverns about
europe the professor said but i know
of none known by that name or that seem
to relate to this legend i wish i could be
of greater assistance to you monsieur

   this has been a help g- said
thanks very much professor

  he hung up the receiver and turned
his expression was as baffled now as it
had been before he had made the call

  der grossvalla might be a series of
caves g- said thats all we can make
out of it

 a series of caves where nippy
asked

  thats what id give a lot to know

they ate breakfast in silence both
g- and nippy were trying to reason
out the problems before them nothing
worthwhile occurred to either

  after they had finished g- was just
about to begin working on the geological
department of the paris university when
nippy came to life with an idea

i was just thinking from another an-
the wings of the iron claw



gle chief he said the chances are that
if bull and battle were taken to germany
they were flown in that means that they
had planes of their own over here and if
so they would have been heard taking off
back of our lines and would have been
reported

  g- was already on the phone calling
intelligence

  and if they didnt have planes of their
own here g- said then they might
have stolen some planes from us in that
case- hello this is g- im calling to
learn if there were any enemy planes
heard leaving our side of the lines during
the night

  the agent at the other end left the
phone to make a check he was back
presently sorry g- but there was
nothing reported

  then were any planes reported stolen
from any of our squadrons say two-
seaters-

the answer came back almost instantly
yes g- two were stolen a salmson
from toron and a dh from blenier
good any trace of either of them
not yet shall we call you if we get
any trace

  please do that g- said

  he turned to nippy theres one an-
swer he said were beginning to nar-
row this down

  two planes stolen eh

  yes from toron and blenier and
theyre both over near the western end of
the front near the swiss and german
border

  right nippy said over near the
black forest

  g- was studying a map for a long
time he was silent and then he shook his
head there are some things about this
that i cant understand

  like what

  herr goulon must have a mass of un-
derground agents that use these triple
claws for gouging their victims theyve
been spread out all over this section of
the country wherever the hospitals are
the thickest there were about two dozen
in the chamber under the monument and
less than half of those were accounted
for

  where have they gone intelligence
the military police and the civil police

have been combing northern france for
them and so far weve captured only one
and the only reason we got him
nippy put in was that bull had knocked
him cold

  okay where have they gone they
didnt leave this side in those stolen two-
seaters and they didnt all march across
the front lines into germany without any-
one knowing about it

  the jangle of the telephone bell was
suddenly loud and g- reached for it in-
stantly he talked fast but without ex-
citement

  heading this way should be here in
two minutes    thanks well take care
of him thanks a lot

  he slammed up the receiver and
punched the button on the wall near the
phone-a signal to the mechanics to get
planes on the line he started for the door
grabbing his helmet and goggles as he
went

  come on nip he said that was un-
necessary for nippy was at his heels hel-
met and goggles on his head a lone
fokker flying full out heading directly
for us here well intercept him
think hes coming to bomb us
never can tell

  the tarmac was suddenly as busy as
a beehive mechanics rolled out the two
spads and were turning the props when
g- and nippy climbed into their jobs

  with a roar one engine caught and then
almost instantly the other began to run
not much time to warm them up they
taxied down to the end of the apron
turned and opened wide both came roar-
ing down the tarmac together and took
the air at almost the same instant

  they banked together and turned
toward the front climbing as they flew

  the lone fokker came screaming out of
the northeast heading straight for them
hissos wide open nippy and g- rose
to meet him he had the advantage of
position they had the numbers

  they spread out as he came at them
nippy swerved to the left and g- to the
right the fokker opened fire

  with a savage upward lunge the spads
made their attack their vickers guns
chattered

  the fokker suddenly swerved and
dived straight for g- it was coming


g- and his battle aces

with terriffic speed g- lashed his stick
and kicked rudder and the plunging fok-
ker missed him by scant inches plunging
down

  just before he crashed the german
pilot seemed to rally and pull out a little
he crashed along the middle of the field
scattering his plane over the landscape

  nippy and g- landed and a sergeant
mechanic came running over with a mes-
sage streamer

  g- unfolded the paper that was in the
streamers pocket he scanned it quickly
with nippy looking on together they
read 

  i am held a prisoner of herr goulon
  you can help me to escape by coming after
  dark to the deserted house at the north
  edge of the village of greiner in baden

  look nippy exploded its signed
b c battle

  g- nodded those arent battles ini-
tials 

  then why did he sign them like that
nippy demanded

  a nd you call bull a dumb ox g-
said battles trying to warn us
he must have been forced to write this-
its a trap and with those two initials
battles trying to spring that trap before
we could walk into it

  but what do they mean  nippy de-
manded

  i can only guess but one guess is
enough i think g- said b c could
stand for be careful couldnt it
jumping jupiter youve got it nip-
py exploded thats it and now we
know where to go

  not necessarily g- said we know
where we can go to walk into a trap but
the probability is that this village of
greiner isnt far from the headquarters
of herr goulon

  then lets go nippy said what
we waiting for

  i think herr goulon was right in his
advice at that g- said the note ad-
vises me to come after dark i think thats
a swell idea myself

  g- opened some large maps of the
area and began searching for the village
he found it a tiny speck at the edge of
the black forest not far from where al-

lied lines touched the swiss border

  g- made some measurements he
paused to light a cigarette and went on
with his studying suddenly nippy wes-
ton exclaimed hey-the wireless

  it had come ever so faintly-so lightly
that it had scarcely disturbed the signal
g- had devised to let them know when
their wireless code call was coming in

  both dropped what they were doing
and leaped for the set g- got there first
and clamped on the ear phones he
worked the key for an instant saying
just two words its bull

  good old bull nippy breathed in re-
lief

  g- was taking down a message his
pencil fairly flying across the paper he
paused tense and breathless and then be-
gan writing again

  suddenly he stopped and sat frozen
to his chair

  nippy hissed what is it

  g- shook his head for a long time
he sat like that listening for the message
to begin again but nothing happened

  at length he turned off the set re-
moved the ear phones and got up tap-
ping the paper with the message he said
weve got it all down here id give a lot
to know what happened to bull in the
middle of his repeat this may really be
the last weve heard from him

chapter seventeen

condemned

when bull heard the door to the
wireless room crashing inward he
ducked back from the wireless set
and stopped his sending he had a brief
frantic hope that g- had caught the rap-
idly sent message- then he had plenty to
worry about on his own

  a shot rang out and he felt the bullet
rip through the uniform under his arm
and threw up both hands surrender was
the only thing left for him and he did that
as completely and quickly as he could
he knew that only his quick movement as
the door had crashed in had saved him

  his greatest concern was herr goulon
there never was any telling what he might
do

other hard-faced powerful agents came
the wings of the iron claw



charging in there were a half-dozen
maybe more bull didnt take time to
count they choked the door and the little
hallway outside with the bulk of their
huge bodies

  bull stood with hands raised not mak-
ing a move until the german with the
luger drawn came around behind him
and ordered him to march out down the
stairs they marched him with bull in the
center of the procession as if they were
going to a beheading party bull was
thinking at the moment that if he got off
that easily he would be pretty fortunate

  they reached the bottom of the winding
stairs no one had spoken after that
one automatic bark there had been scarce-
ly a sound made except the shuffling and
stamping of feet as they milled about

  now a bellowing roar came as they
stepped into the reception hall and strode
across the floor herr goulon limping
was hurrying to meet them his left arm
the one with the three-pronged hook at
the end was swinging back and forth as
he came rushing along

  you swine he screamed where
were you what was he doing

  the german with the luger rasped
he was in the wireless room sending a
message

  a message herr goulon barked
who were you sending a message to
bull stood with hands a little lower
he asked can i put my arms down
now i have been searched-or perhaps
you are afraid of me with only bare
hands

  silence herr goulon shrilled

  bull waited and then herr goulon
seeming to realize that he was getting no-
where nodded put down your froj
feet pig

  bulls face reddened he would feel the

blood rushing into his cheeks they grew
burning hot he lowered his arms

  i ask you a question herr goulon
barked

  who was i sending a message to i
was conferring with my chief you may
remember g- herr goulon

  what did you tell him

  all i knew

  is he coming here herr goulon de-
manded he actually seemed suddenly
pleased with the idea it seemed strange
to bull

  i wouldnt be surprised if i were
you bull said

  i shall not be goulon almost purred
he came a little nearer stopped i could
not have planned it better 

  bull stood frozen in sudden understand-
ing herr goulon caught the look in his
eyes and stopped there were more than
a half-dozen of goulons men standing on
either side of them most of them with
drawn lugers one false move by bull
and hed be punctured in a number of vital
spots-he controlled himself with diffi-
culty

finally goulon spoke the fool is
a greater fool than i gave him credit
for he deserves to see his master in my
hands take him below to the dungeon
with the other one

  he strode out of the hall

  at least four lugers were jabbed in
bulls ribs hands gripped his arms and
whirling him about headed him for a
stairs that led down into the belly of the
great tree-covered castle

  they went down one flight and then
another the stones of the second stairs
were damp and some of them were slip-
pery with ancient moss along a narrow
corridor they marched past a door that
was partly open and from which came
strange odors of chemicals

  bull tried to peer in as they marched
him past one of the germans slapped
his face that was another moment when
it was difficult to hold control of himself-
but bull martin was learning

  before a door made of iron bars almost
two inches thick they paused and one of
the germans unlocked the door the door
swung open and bull was shoved inside
his arms still held by the powerful men


g- and his battle aces

at either side of him they tied his hands
and feet-

  he saw battle lying against the far
wall of the dungeon also securely trussed
the door clanged shut

  herr goulons men left then and bull
could hear them striding down the corri-
dor he listened with particular care to
make sure that none of them lingered in
the corridor just outside the door

  battle was first to speak he whispered
in a surprisingly normal voice mister
bull you all right sir

  not too bad bull grunted

  perhaps i can relieve you a bit bat-
tle said

  to bulls amazement battle eased up
from his cramped position his heavy
bonds dropping away

  holy herring bull gasped youre
practically a magician how did you do
it

  its a rather long story sir something
i picked up years ago ill let off a bit of
the pressure on you sir for now but we
must be ready-someone comes every few
moments to check

  down here

  yes sir

  bull felt his bonds tighten briefly then
give he grunted

  that better sir

  ill say how did they get you
battle

  they just came and took me while i
was telephoning sir caught me by sur-
prise do you know where we are
bull told him as nearly as he could i
got in the wireless room and sent a mes-
sage to g- telling him he said

  excellent battle hissed i had to
write him a note managed to slip in a
warning at least he will know where to
come for herr goulon he is too smart
to be trapped

  bull began to feel a little better

tf i may say so sir ive been thinking
a bit it would be top-hole if we
could take over and settle this matter our-
selves you know

  bull nodded and in spite of his uncom-
fortable position he grinned

  id sure like to try it he admitted
if you break me out of these wrappings
well have a crack at it

  battle suddenly froze then suddenly
he leaped to his feet

  someone is coming i think it is herr
goulon

  like a monkey battle began scrambling
to the far side of the cell bull hissed a
question

  hey shouldnt i be tied up more-
for the looks

  righto sir i nearly forgot sir per-
haps-better

  battle came back twisted the bonds and
bull was twisted grotesquely his arms
drawn tightly behind him

  hey he groaned you trying to get
even with me for all the cracks ive made
about you

  oh no sir battle panted but-
sorry sir but theres no more time

  the heavy boots were coming closer
battle whispered again one of them is
herr goulon

  bull could twist his neck around and
see battle scrambling back into his bonds
he just managed it in time

  feet paused outside the grated door
bull heard the voice of herr goulon say-
ing you see excellency i have two of
the four within another twenty-four
hours i promise you i will have the other
two then- he broke off to give a
rasping cackle of a laugh- we will try
the gas on them you saw already how it
works on rats we shall try it then on
these four rats in this cage nicht wahr 
an excellent idea another voice said
let us hope you succeed in catching
them

  but i cannot miss herr goulon said
i have already two traps set for g-
the other one-he will be easy

  they turned walking back down the
corridor the way they had come bull and
battle could both hear what they said

  herr goulon was speaking in a loud
boastful voice

  with the gas we shall be able to ac-
complish much more behind the enemys
lines-

  how many agents have you for this
my agents number over a thousand
they come and go freely between here and
the allied side of the lines through der
grossvalla tonight at midnight i meet
with them in the central chamber of der
grossvalla the instructions and the gas
the wings of the iron claw



will be distributed tonight after mid-
night i send them to every hospitalization
center in the northern half of france the
terror will be complete

  their voices died away bull martin
rasped battle get me loose lets go
weve got to settle this thing ourselves
g- may get here too late

chapter eighteen

traps for two

g-s face was grave as he studied
the maps that showed them the
country about greiner and that
portion of the black forest he pointed
to the mark of a castle it was marked
hidden on the map that meant that
either trees or camouflage concealed the
old castle from view from the air

  if it wasnt for battle and bull maybe
still being alive in that castle nippy
ventured we could go over with a flock
of bombers and blow it off the map
g- didnt answer right away nippy
knowing his chief well stepped to the
little phonograph and waited until he
could catch g-s eye when he did he
nodded questioningly and the master spy
nodded back without further question-
ing nippy put on g-s favorite jazz rec-
ord in another moment the raggy tones
of raggin the scale came romping
from the machine

  nippy played the record over and over
again while g- paced the room

  it was well past noon when g- stopped
suddenly and smiled

  i think weve got it nip get out the
make-up kit well have to do the best
we can without battle

  whats the dope

  we know from battles message that
there is at least one trap set for us at the
vacant house on the north outskirts of
greiner bull was cut off halfway through
the second sending of his message that
means they hadnt planned on his con-
tacting us-but having found out that he
did theyll be doubly careful

that makes two traps nippy said
right we wont wait until tonight
to go over well go over as soon as we
can get started ill be a german general
and you will be my adjutant

  me a german adjutant you know
my german-

  what german adjutant has to do
more than say jawohlf if an adjutant
is a yes man anywhere its in the ger-
man army ive got our identification
papers-beyond that well trust to luck
lie was at the phone now calling anoth-
er hangar far down the length of le
bourget field

  have you got a two-seater rumpler
or hanoveraner

  we have a rumpler in excellent flying
condition monsieur g- if you would
like to see it-

  ill take your word for it g- said
but i want it tricked up a little my
own mechanics will do that

   oiii monsieur i will send it right
down

  nippy had the big make-up kit out and
he went into the wardrobe and got out two
uniforms one for himself and one a
generals uniform for g- the master
spy glanced at them nodded his approval
and went out to give orders to the me-
chanics

  to the mechanic sergeant he said
when that rumpler i have ordered gets
here i want a leak from the oil pipe run
into the exhaust put a valve on it so
that when i get ready i can turn it on and
let the oil drip into the exhaust stack
the sergeant grinned sir thats pret-
ty smart he said going to give the
idea youre on fire sir

  thats it exactly g- said drill
some holes along the top and bottom of the
exhaust pipe but so that the hot exhaust
flames wont come out on the fabric that
will string the smoke out

  yes sir the sergeant saluted

back in the apartment g- and nippy
began making up nippy came out a
severe arrogant young german haupt-
mann and g- a serious-faced studious
german general with a touch of gray at
the temples

  they put on the uniforms and having
finished their dressing surveyed them-
selves in the long mirror

  perfect g- said

  nippy bowed with a snap from the
waist jawohl danke schon your ex-
cellency


g- and his battle aces

  g- started for the door and nippy
followed him they went to the rumpler
g- got into the front cockpit and nippy
into the rear there was a brief check for
controls and then the master spy gave her
the gun and they roared into the air and
headed toward the front

  g- climbed for all the altitude he could
get before he got near the front he
feared most of all a brace of allied planes
dropping on them from some cloud

  there were puffy clouds higher and
they climbed for them but the rumpler
didnt have much soup and she wavered
and wobbled as she climbed and finally
she reached her ceiling

  it was cold up there and g- turned to
look about and told nippy keep an eye
out for allied planes

  those words had just left the lips of
the master spy when he saw the flight
of three nieuports diving on them from
above

  they were still a good mile or more
away they were coming out of the sun
diving from a higher altitude than the
old lumbering german two-seater could
climb

  they heard the chatter of machine-gun
fire from far off and g- and nippy both
knew that these nieuport pilots were
green that was a break but they were
gaining rapidly

  in desperation g- stuck the nose of
the rumpler down into a gentle dive and
hit the throttle for more speed they
headed for a large cloud ahead a mile or
more over the german lines

  the nieuports were gaining it was
going to be close g- yelled to nippy
pretend to be firing that tail gun try to
bluff them but turning he saw that
nippy was already doing just that

  the cloud came closer and in another
moment just as long-range tracers were
slashing at them they plunged into the
fleecy mist of the cloud

  when they came out a hail of lewis
machine-gun slugs met them g- ducked
back into the cloud and went droning on
blindly

  the cloud was a long one but it
wouldnt be long enough theyd be out
of the other end all too soon

  now they shot out again but they shot
out of the bottom of the cloud and nieu-

ports were nowhere in sight g- scanned
the sky frantically-and nippy yelled a
warning

  up there behind us and in the sun
again run for it

  g- was running for it he hit the
throttle again and they went screaming
in a steeper glide for another cloud

  the nieuports came screaming down
on them like hornets maybe these allied
pilots were new and over-anxious but
there was nothing wrong with their nerve
and aim

  a stream of tracers slashed through the
right wing and another burst pounded on
the fuselage not too far back of nippy

  g- yelled back to the terrier ace
give them a burst dont hit them just
scare them

  for five cents id wave my under-
shirt nippy yelled back and then there
was a short burst from his gun-and
silence

  my gun is jammed nippy yelled

chapter nineteen

death-fiight

frantically g- kicked rud-
der and lashed the stick about to
maneuver the rumpler out of the
line of fire of the nieuports but the allied
planes had got a taste of blood and now
they were coming in for the kill

  the main trouble with the two-seater
german crate was that it was entirely
too slow and even if they had been
fighting to kill that lone machine gun on
the tail of the rumpler wouldnt have
done much good

  g- tried desperately for another cloud
straight ahead that was the only one in
the sky before them and it wasnt much
bigger than a pillow

  no help there if he could get down
and begin hedgehopping he might wear
those nieuports down flying directly
behind theyd have a hard time hitting
the rumpler

  g- had an idea that hed have to take
the rumpler down all the way the earth
below them was dotted with germans and
as he came down he saw them waving
and cheering the rumpler thinking it was
flown by one of their own pilots
the wings of the iron claw



  he was diving lower and lower a
burst of slugs slammed through the in-
struments before him and carried the al-
timeter away well he could do without
that now

  above a half-plowed field g- pulled
up and went skimming over the trees at
the other end ofit the nieuports still
followed zigzagging g- sent the two-
seater rumbling along with the landing
gear sometimes almost clipping the top
branches out of the trees

  suddenly there was a clunking sound
in the engine ahead the nearest nieu-
port had gained in speed had climbed
and now was diving down at the rum-
pler that was bad he hadnt expected
it to do that it was a clever move on
the part of the allied pilot

  another stream-and another-came
chattering down from that diving nieu-
port g- saw the slugs cut into the
cowling around the rumpler engine the
engine gave a mighty snort and backfired
and then the prop stopped

  g- managed to wobble over a row of
trees and then he dropped down into a
field another burst came from the nieu-
port just as he started in for the landing
and that bunch of slugs really did damage
smoke belched from the engine cockpit
and a tongue of flame whipped back at
g-

  were on fire nippy yelled lets
get out of here

  g- kicked her over into a slip and
came in that way blowing the smoke and
the flame away from the cockpits they
came slashing into the field and he let her
skid sidewise until he felt the wind going
out of her then while he still had con-
trol he straightened out-and just barely
in time

  the rumpler settled on wheels and
skid the flames and the smoke poured
back over the cockpits thick enough to
smother both g- and nippy g- leaped
over the side held to the longeron of the
fuselage for a moment and then making
sure that nippy was out ahead of him
dropped to the ground and hit running

  the rumpler rolled on for perhaps a
hundred feet and piled up in a mass of
flames against a stone wall at the far end
the nieuports circled and headed back
home

  for a moment g- and nippy stood
there alone in the middle of the field
they turned at the same moment and
looked at each other and nippy began to
grin

  well that takes care of that he said

  g- nodded but spoke in german at
least we didnt have to set fire to that
rumpler as i planned

  nippy came back in german this
looks more like the real thing excel-
lency

  above the roar of the crackling flames
they heard a high-speed car traveling
toward them from the direction of the
front

  how far are we from our objective

  too far g- said but a car can
get us there by tonight sometime i
planned to get there before that how-
ever

they turned and walked together off
toward the east where a road skirted
the field before they reached the road
they saw the car it came racing up and
braked in a cloud of dust

  it was a large staff car in it were a
driver and a high officer the driver
leaped out and opened the door and the
officer got down with dignity he wore a
majors insignia

  the major saluted nippy and g-
returned the salute and climbed over the
low stone fence bordering the road

  bitte excellency the major said i
did not expect to find you in this plane

  g- blustered some just whom did
you expect to find iierr major

  the major remembered then he bowed
and said excuse me excellency may
i introduce myself major von ordell
at your sendee

g- leaped over the side


g- and his battle aces

  that is very fortunate g- said i
am general von dietz this is my ad-
jutant herr hauptmann ernst we were
on our way to an important meeting
could we have the use of your car herr
major

  i am honored the major bowed

  he stepped back and motioned them to
the car if you dont mind dropping me
off at the next town on your way i shall
get another car for myself 

  that will not be necessary herr
major g- said all this fitted in com-
pletely with his hopes and plans when
they reached the castle and the headquar-
ters of herr goulon in the black forest
perhaps about evening the major a small
man who could not be one of g-s as-
sistants would verify the fact that the
general had crashed in an airplane acci-
dent

  g- went on you will ride with us if
you dont mind herr major 

  the major bowed again and they got in
and the driver shifted gears and they
drove away

  late in the afternoon they stopped at a
little roadside inn to eat then at g-s
direction they drove on

  the driver seemed to know the country
well as they came in sight of the moun-
tains of black fir g- mentioned the loca-
tion of the castle to the driver the latter
nodded and saluted

it was growing dark as they drew up
through the thick trees to the castle
above greiner guards stood at the en-
trance and came out to meet them there
was a powerful brute of a leutnant whose
voice was a growl like that of an angry
beast

  who are you

  g- leaned forward as the leutnant shot
his flashlight on each man in the car in-
stantly the leutnant stiffened and clicked
his heels

  excellency he said bitte i must
ask for identification and orders herr
goulon insists

  g- handed over his forged papers the
leutnant looked at them and nodding
handed them back

  he looked at the papers of each in turn

  they got down and entered the castle
they walked through the great reception

hall and down the corridor beyond to the
spacious office of herr goulon the mani-
ac stood up as they entered his sunken
eyes burned into g-s but they passed
on to inspect the rest of the party

  the major told his story of the sky-
battle and the crash

  herr goulon said you must pardon
my precautions i am expecting a man i
hope to kill-a spy known as g-

  g- stiffened do you mean to say
you havent captured him yet he
stormed i was told that you had report-
ed him dead

   herr goulon deflated visibly a ruse
 he said to make him fall into my trap
 his voice carried very little conviction

  g- felt like laughing in the maniacs
face

  but herr goulon was not satisfied he
reached for the phone and he said stand
where you are meine herren i will
verify what you have told me

  g- stiffened this wasnt going to be
good if goulon checked on the real gen-
eral von dietz hed find him elsewhere
von dietz so far as g- knew at last
report was on the belgian front

chapter twenty

murder lab

the voices of herr goulon and the
general with him had died away
bull was trembling a little with ex-
citement

  come on battle shake a leg he
whispered get me out of this so we
can get started

  coming right over sir

  he began untying the thongs that bound
bulls wrists and ankles

  think weve got much time to work
battle before someone comes back to look
again bull demanded

  battle shrugged as he worked its
difficult to say sir he admitted one
can never tell when the blighters will be
returning sir

  did you hear what herr goulon
said

   yes sir

   ive got an idea battle

  yes sir so have i

  whats yours
the wings of the iron claw



  well sir about that meeting at mid-
night they made me very uncomfortable
when they first brought me here and be-
fore i got loose i tried to think how we
could throttle the whole group sir i was
thinking-if we could get the agents of
herr goulon together in one place and
then blow them up

  but the gas battle bull enthused
that ought to do it better than anything
else

  right sir thats what i was think-
ing that would suggest the laboratory
thats exactly what i was working
on bull said he stood up and stretched
his great muscular body opened and closed
his fists id sure like to plant these in
herr goulons face

  and i would jolly well like to see it
done sir but it seems that it would be
most important to wait until we can get
them all

  bull strode softly over to the locked
iron-barred door

  well you got us this far battle bull
hissed how do we get out of here the
laboratory is down the corridor the door
was open and i passed it when they
brought me here and ive got a hunch
if we can get out of here well see how
it works

  have you any ideas about getting out
of here sir

  know anything about picking a lock
bull demanded

  a little battle said he produced a
piece of wire heavy and stiff enough to
work with

  with that they worked for a long time
at the lock on the cell door taking turns
twice while bull worked the bent wire
he almost caught the tumblers-then lost
them again he broke out in a sweat

footsteps sounded on the hard pav-
ing outside the footsteps came closer
and then stopped there was a tense mo-
ment of waiting then the steps receded
going back down the corridor the way
they had come

  they worked again at the lock battles
delicate touch finally did the trick-the
tumblers clicked and the door swung open

  bull peered out and froze a figure
standing at the laboratory door the man
hadnt been there before he whispered
to battle

  did that guard hear what weve been
doing and saying

  battle peered out and drew back inside
the dungeon again

  perhaps not sir hes farther down
the passage the dim light-but hes very
big

  hell fall harder when i hit him bull
breathed

  the big fellow felt about the floor until
he found a loose rock now with the rock
in his hand he pushed out of the door and
started silently down the side of the stone
corridor

  inch by inch he worked his way the
guard stood with his back toward bull
he didnt seem armed except for the
luger in his holster the flap of the hol-
ster was fastened that was good

g- and his battle aces

  bull took another step and another
closer to him-and the guard turned sud-
denly when bull was ten feet from him

   each felt instants indecision as their
eyes met then bull somehow knew what
to do by the surprised but mild expres-
sion on the huge guards ugly face he
walked calmly on

  the guard said i did not hear you
coming

  bull nodded i am your relief he
said in his best german

  the guard shrugged and turned to go
but before he could reach a point directly
in front of the half-open laboratory door
bull swung the rock

  he caught the guard as he dropped him
and dragged him down the corridor to the
cell battle helped him battle said that
was quick headwork sir

  he can take my place bull said
lets get him tied up quick

   that should help bull said

  there was nothing barring them from
the laboratory now nothing that is but
the two men working inside of the smelly
underground room

   bull pushed the door open a little more
and peered in then he pointed out one
of the figures to battle

  youre going to take his place

  he pushed battle aside without waiting
for an answer walked calmly into the
laboratory the german he had pointed
out to battle was tall and gaunt there
was a smaller older man working at a
great machine where glass containers
were being filled and sealed with a metal
cap he seemed engrossed in his work
and did not turn

  i am the new guard bull said

  the tall gaunt german turned and
eyed him and then calmly nodded

   this all seems very interesting bull
said in his best german it didnt matter
so much whether his german was taken
as good or not here the main thing was
to get this gaunt german to talk

   he did he said  ja most interesting
and most deadly he pointed to a great
pile of bottles filled with a pale green
liquid there you see gas enough to
kill a million men and women too for that
matter

  interesting bull said how quickly
does it kill 

  with the second breath the german
said he worked on

   i am hans schuller bull said who
are you

  i am herr doktor weiner the man
said continuing his work

the other german looked about for
an instant and then directed his at-
tention to his bottling bull moved over
to him

  the little man turned and glanced at
him then went on with his work bull
waited until he turned off the machine-
then he struck

   the little man keeled over and lay on
the floor quite still a low cry came from
the gaunt german

  what are you doing

  his back was toward the door as he
faced bull martin battle slipped be-
hind him his hand lifted fell and the
gaunt man collapsed

  they hid the little man under one of
the work tables covered him with some
packing paper and carried the gaunt ger-
man into the dungeon hastily battle
changed clothes with the german chemist

   bull studied battles face and that of
the chemists you two arent too far
apart for looks bull said have you got
a little make-up

   battle said ive scarcely had a chance
to carry any of the make-up with me
bull took another look at his face and
the germans

   you need some touching up he said
wouldnt take much

   i know the formula battle said if
they have the proper chemicals in the
laboratory perhaps i can mix a batch
they hurried to the laboratory and bull
helped him pour out smelly stuff from
various bottles and mix them in an earthen
bowl it took some time for the chemicals
to join-there was a boiling process that
took much too long for bull-but when
they were through and bull saw the
transformed battle he chuckled with
satisfaction

  when the sound of stamping boots
came to them battle was at the laboratory
studiously compounding something he
hoped would not explode in his face and
bull was standing outside the door with
the other guards luger at his side
the wings of the iron claw



  he stood stiff and menacing as herr
goulon came striding down the corridor
there were two german officers with
herr goulon

chapter twenty-one

midnight rendezvous

g- stood rigid waiting as herr goulon
made a telephone call he spoke to
headquarters mentioned the majors
name

  the answer must have been satisfactory
for he nodded his ugly head and hung up
the phone

  without further questioning he rasped
that seems to be correct herr major
you may go with your driver

  the major left and goulon turned to
g- and nippy

  you will pardon my hesitancy your
excellency i must make sure

  i understand g- said now to
get on with the business

  he stopped the forged order of in-
spection he had presented might mean
anything he waited anxious to know
how herr goulon might interpret it

  the german actually tried to smile it
was a hideous attempt he said for-
tunately you have come just in time ex-
cellency my agents will all meet me
tonight in der grossvalla perhaps you
are wondering what der grossvalla is
you have heard of it no doubt

  ja i have heard of it

  but you do not know what it is herr
goulon cackled since you will be per-
mitted to go into der grossvalla tonight
i will let you in on my secret it is a
gigantic underground passage a series
of caverns that leads from below this
castle under the front lines and comes
up some distance behind the rear of the
allies it is through this great passage
that my agents come and go tonight
they meet me in the great central cham-
ber tonight i will give them their final
instructions for a new phase of our terror
campaign from midnight on we shall
use a new gas i have had developed

  he got up from his seat behind his
desk and strode toward the great door and
the corridor beyond

come i will show you the entrance to

der grossvalla and also my laboratory
i will show you as well my two prison-
ers

  g- saw nippy grow tense the master
spy himself couldnt seem to get rid of a
taut feeling in his middle

  they followed herr goulon across the
great hall and down one flight of stairs
and then another

  der grossvalla is far underground
herr goulon said i discovered it dur-
ing my cave explorations before the
war a guard stood beside a door well
down the corridor he was a big ugly
looking brute with a misshapen face and
a powerful build

  herr goulon paused at the half-open
door of the laboratory and motioned them
to come in the guard stood still look-
ing straight ahead they passed him and
herr goulon pointed to the gaunt thin
man at work at the bench he pointed
out the piles of bottles sealed with metal
stoppers he explained that they would
be taken into the central chamber very
soon now and said further you will
honor me with your presence excel-
lency

  g- bowed and said he would i
would like very much to see these two
prisoners

  they went out into the corridor and
paused before the iron door herr goulon
said that is the one known as bull
martin the other one is the english
servant known as battle

  nippy stood just behind g- he
peered through and then his hand touched
g-s back he began tapping out a mes-
sage with only the pressure of his finger
as though he were operating a wireless
key

  these are not bull and battle here
ill bet thats them in the laboratory

  g- nodded slowly as he asked and
you are quite sure that you will have the
other two very soon perhaps by morn-
ing

  herr goulon looked relieved by
morning excellency most certainly

they moved on down the corridor it
grew steeper going on down like a
ramp as they walked on around a curve
toward a great closed door herr goulon
produced a key from above a great jutting


q and his battle aces

rock and unlocked the door instantly
they could feel a draft of air blowing
through the door and down into a great
open chamber

  herr goulons rasping voice made a
series of echoes now as he said you
will follow me excellency

  they walked for a long distance into
the series of caverns

  in a little over an hour herr goulon
said my agents will assemble here from
all over france

  already there were perhaps fifty stand-
ing against the side wall

  that draft of air was still blowing from
the castle herr goulon pointed to a
stone rostrum at one side of the great
underground theater i will stand there
and speak to my agents he said i will
give the -orders and then they will pass
before the rostrum and receive their
supply of bottles

  as he spoke some of his brutes from
the castle were bringing the gas supply

  g- took a bold step he said to the
maniac herr goulon perhaps you have
other matters to attend to suppose my
adjutant and i carry out our inspection
by ourselves

  herr goulon paused and his bloodshot
eyes glinted curiously then he seemed
satisfied and nodded his ugly head very
well i have one or two matters to at-
tend to excellency

  herr goulon turned and limped away
g- watched him and then turned and
walked back along the series of passages
toward the castle dungeons

  the door into the dungeon section
under the castle was open they strode
through the great opening and on past
the cell

  two of herr goulons agents came out
of the laboratory with more of the death
liquid they passed g-s and nippy with
scarcely a glance

  g- entered the laboratory with an air
of authority he passed the big guard at
the door and nippy came after him

  there was no one inside except the tall
gaunt chemist g- paused beside him and
asked what is your name

  he used his own voice although he
spoke in german

  the gaunt chemist turned and half
opened his mouth then his expression

changed completely and he leaped for-
ward gasping stop it mister bull
g- ducked instinctively and spun
round nippy stood on the other side of
g- he had leaped in but the blow was
already falling g- saw it coming bull
was bringing down an iron bar on his
head

  he ducked his head just in time shifted
quickly to the left and caught the bar

  the master spy couldnt help laughing
for an instant he said have you been
going around beating out the brains of
every gennan general you see

  bull stared at them weak thunder-
struck i thought we could maybe put
you birds out and get in your uniforms
and be in on the meeting tonight

  youll have to shop somewhere else
g- grinned what were your plans

he saw a strained expression on
battles face and suddenly heard a
sound at the door herr goulon stood in
the doorway and there was no way of
telling how much he had heard

  g- nodded to the maniac i was just
inspecting the laboratory he said most
interesting i shall see you at the meeting
of your agents presently

  he spoke with an easy assurance he
didnt feel and rather to his surprise
goulon gave a short nod and went on

  g- spun around to his battle aces
quick fill your pockets with bottles
of the gas liquid we must start down in
another minute or two

  we all go bull hissed

  all four of us hurry

  two officers came to the laboratory
door one of them said there you are
excellency herr goulon asked me to
make sure that you were not late

  we were just going g- said

  the hauptmann waited i have orders
to accompany you he said and as nippy
and g- stepped out into the corridor the
two officers fell in behind them

  they marched on through the wide and
the narrow passages of the underground
chambers and then paused as they en-
tered the great meeting place

  a thousand of the beast-men of herr
goulon were assembled there herr
goulon was mounting the rostrum the
officer behind g- said in his ear you
the wings of the iron claw



will go up on the rostrum with herr
goulon

  g- shook his head without turning

  nein he said i will stay here

  bitte excellency the hauptmann
said i have my orders herr goulon
wishes you on the rostrum with him

chapter twenty-two
escape

as yet the master spy had not
turned to look at the men behind
him he had a feeling however
that there was a luger leveled at his back
-that the game was up and goulon was
playing with him as a cat toys with a
mouse

  then there was sudden action behind
him he heard a yelled curse that was cut
off in the middle a luger spat and g-
whirled he saw bull and battle in action
theyd leapt on the two officers who had
been behind him

  g-s luger was out it spat flame and
death and he whirled and let fly with one
of the gas bottles it burst in the midst
of the throng of the now milling brute
agents they started surging for the north
entrance but another bottle and another
burst among them and the thin slightly
greenish vapor rose and spread like a
plague over them

  battle and bull and nippy were letting
fly with some of their bottles as they
plunged back into the passage the vapor
was rising from the broken bottles a
mad brute who was close by came lung-
ing through the vapor coughing

  g-s luger cracked and the agent
pitched on his face coughed twice more
and lay still

  herr goulon had leaped from the ros-
trum and was screaming like a beast gone
mad he came tearing at them but two
bottles of his own stuff burst in front of
him

  they came racing through the heavy
door and slammed that shut and locked
it from the castle side that would hold
the others in that death trap until they
were dead the gas carried by the draft
would already have the south shaft choked
with the fumes

  they dashed on up one flight of stairs

and then another and into the great hall
there was no one in sight the place
was deserted

  g- jerked his head toward the outside
gates

  were all going back the same way
you and battle came over he said
when i came in i saw the salmson and
the dh half hidden in that field back
of the castle

  even there no one was on guard every
living agent and guard of herr goulon
had been called into the maze of caverns
that now were filled perhaps forever with
the deadly gas

  the salmson and the liberty engines
roared out in the night flame spat from
the exhaust stacks they warmed the
engines and bull and battle in the salm-
son g- and nippy in the dh went
thundering off toward the south and home

  searchlights over the front cut the
blackness of the night with their beams
then out of the blackness came a flock of
diving screaming fokkers to the attack
while the searchlight beams lashed the
night sky the fokkers dived and lunged
and their machine guns chattered

  but the spandau guns of the fokkers
were not the only guns that blasted that
night for nippy weston in the back of
the dh and battle at the twin lewis
guns of the salmson were doing their
share and now and then in that wild
running fight a fokker fell with sparks
and smoke pouring out of it to form a gi-
gantic tracer in the sky

  this nippy yelled is the nuts
then yank searchlights slashed the
night skies and the heinie pursuits de-
cided to head back for home the two
allied planes went rumbling  straight
for le bourget

spying

the boys all expected anything of
doc bowker- tut they never
thought hed fall in love with ger
manys deadliest woman spy

captain lacey our skipper of
the th pursuit squadron was
sure anxious he stood in front
of our hangar waiting and watching the
northeastern sky he was kind of like a
grounded eagle waiting for the brood to
come home

the captain had the toughest job on
the field because while bill my partner
and i had to worry about doing the little

youd better talk
captain guynk the
cognac you drank was
poisoned i



a greaseball joe story
keep em spying



stuff like having right valve clearances
and tight bearings and such like any
greaseballs the skipper had the worries
of the whole outfit on his shoulders

  and this job that he was trying to get
done seemed like about the toughest thing
the old th pursuits had ever tackled
a german bombardment squadron with
a flock of new rumpler planes for day
bombing had moved up to within range
of paris and a lot of very important ob-
jectives and theyd come slipping over
when you least expected them give out
with a load of destruction and get back
before we could spot them funny thing
was that our boys that is the crazy gang
of pilots of the th never were around
when they were needed which burned
the skipper to a cinder

  well that phantom light bomber outfit
of the germans had done their dirty work
three days before wed had a big drive
on and they had gone over like they knew
more about it than we did and had blown
up our hidden ammunition dump for the
drive just twenty-four hours before it was
to come off now any fool knows that
you dont move up ammunition enough for
a major drive in twenty-four hours not
through tliat french mud you dont so
that had been the last crimp theyd put
in us-the last knot that jerry had tied
in our tail

  so the skipper had been sending our
boys out to locate the base of these fast
light bombers if and when they found
the base we could go over and blast them
out and cripple them but so far nothing
had been spotted big enough to let those
rumplers get off

  now captain lacey was standing there
yanking on his right ear-lobe and kind
of cursing softly to himself and watching
for the boys

  i guess hed been waiting for fifteen
minutes or more when i heard him yip
here they come and then he said
what the- and stopped short

  bill and i had been working just in-
side our hangar door so we could run out
when we got word from the skipper we
wanted to stand out there with him and
watch but that wouldnt be right because
who were we a couple of greaseballs to
stand out there and not get our work
done

  so we rushed out and then all at once
we saw what the skipper was squawking
about we could see our spads coming
in low and we started to count but be-
fore we got up to four we caught sight
of one of the spads dhing down toward
the ground

  now this guy wasnt going down for
a forced landing his hisso was rev-
ving up nice and full and he was diving
like a hawk on a sparrow we just caught
sight of him before he dropped down be-
hind a little hill northeast of our field
he came zooming up in sight again and
then he dived once more

  at that distance we couldnt tell who it
was we hadnt seen him break forma-
tion and the planes were coming just about
in line flying low down so we couldnt
see the gap he had left

  what in the name of this and that
the skipper wanted to know is eating
that bird whoever he is certainly that
german airdrome isnt over there within
a mile of this field

  the spad zoomed up and then dived
again it did this three more times then
came slipping over the hill and on into
the field

  the rest of the boys had already landed
their spads they were all there we
hadnt had any serious trouble with the
enemy in the way of dogfights for some
time but you never know so we al-
ways counted bill and i when the boys
came back and when we counted enough
we always breathed easier that gang of
the th while they were crazy as a pack
of loons were the greatest guys in the
world

  well there they were safely on the
ground now climbing out of their ships
there was buzz hartin our pal and
senior flight leader buzz usually kept
us posted as to what went on among the
officers that we didnt see

  then there was jasper peck that lanky
hog specialist from out in the pig coun-
try and jack petley son of the american
chocolate king and charlie gray and
george conrad guy stratton and hank
speck the amateur detective and john
gilmore the movie star and well you
know them all mostly

  they were all there except doc bow-
ker so we knew that this was doc com-


g- anj his battle aces

ing in over the field boundary now

  maybe i should explain right here
that at this period none of us were sur-
prised at anything we saw doc bowker
do the poor guy was in love yes sir
-in love right up to his ears and his
ears set pretty high on his head too

  of all the guys to get caught you
may remember that doc bowker was the
wise guy of the th there wasnt any-
thing that came up that doc bowker didnt
have a solution for with the present ex-
ception like i say the poor oaf was
in love and he just didnt have time for
anything else

  doc was the guy who had studied just
enough in medical school so he thought
he knew everything like they say a
little knowledge is a dangerous thing and
that was the way it was with doc sev-
eral times during that first world war he
came close to killing guys because he
thought he knew all there was to know
about medicine

ell youd think that doc would
have known better than to get mixed
up with this frill named lili now dont
get me wrong so far as i could tell
there was absolutely nothing wrong with
lili either mentally or morally and cer-
tainly not physically she certainly was
the click-click of super-super

  she was one of these blonde brown-
eyed french dolls just tall enough and
just-well you know and brother when
she smiled just a little and turned those
big brown eyes on you your heart melted
like butter in july

   of course we all said that doc should
know better because she was a heart-
breaker if i ever saw one but then among
j the mechanics and officers there sure
was a lot of hearts laid out to break if
 she had looked our way long enough
what made everybody kind of mystified
was that she took after doc bowker

  i dont mean to say that doc was the
worst looking guy in the outfit but he
wasnt the best looking guy by a mile

   there was charlie gray if you wanted
a guy for looks charlie owned that little
two dogs long and a half a dog high
pup named sausage you remember the
dog with the sensitive tail

  and of course there was john gil-

more the screen lover wre had with us
i could name others george conrad and-

  but anyway lili went for doc bow-
ker and like shakespeare says there
is no accounting for love among hogs
jackasses or people that shakespeare
was pretty smart

  well doc gets down and climbs out
of his spad and without so much as a
good morning go to havana or howdy he
starts right off on foot for the northeast
where he had been diving and zooming
around the countryside

captain lacey lets out a bellow hey
doc where do you think youre going 

  doc didnt seem to hear he kept right
on hiking across the field captain lacey
growled deep down in his throat like a
bomber tuning up and he yanked out his
colt automatic

  it kind of scared me at first i guess
it scared buzz hartin too because just
as the gun went off buzz knocked up the
skippers arm

  captain lacey barks what did you
want to do that for i might have shot
doc

  you werent trying to shoot him
buzz said

  of course not you fool im trying
to stop him that guys got something
on his mind stronger than military rules
and im going to scare it out of him

  so he took another aim and pulled the
trigger again-he pulled it several times
and we could see the dirt kick up in front
of doc

 doc seemed to come to then he
stopped and turned around

  come back you deaf idiot the skip-
per yelled to him come back before i
miss your path and plug you

  that seemed to wake doc up and he
turned around and came back he looked
kind of sheepish but still plenty mad

  now where did you think you were
going captain lacey demanded

  lili is two-timing me doc said and
his voice choked like he was going to
break out in tears i saw it from the
air

  buzz hartin cut in was that lili
walking back from that patch of woods

  you saw it too doc almost sobs

  who could miss it jack petley said
grinning
keep em spying



  it was funny now to see how the guys
couldnt help almost laughing at doc
they all wanted to say i told you so
being sore because lili hadnt gone for
them

  anyway captain lacey said any of
you have any luck today

  we got the drome spotted this time
buzz hartin grinned they got the
planes hidden under nets at the edge of
a woods if wed had bombs we could
have blasted them

  you wouldnt kid me  captain lacey
demanded

  certainly not skipper buzz tells
him we got it spotted all right all
were waiting for is the word to go bomb
them out

doc bowker was standing there
kind of weaving toward the north end
of the field and looking like hes about to
have a hemorrhage finally he cut in
with excuse me sir i got to find out
that french officer she was with i-
will you get out of here captain
lacey said and then as doc starts off
lacey barks wait did you see any-
thing of that enemy bomber drome 
what enemy drome doc says look-
ing like an idiot

  the enemy drome the bombard-
ment- the skipper is fit to be tied

  oh yes sir i mean no sir i mean
i didnt-

  captain lacey waved his hand in dis-
gust get outa here before i slap you
conscious he yelled and doc got

  he turned to buzz did the enemy
realize that you had spotted than
maybe buzz said but before we
took off i told the boys not to make any
sign if we did spot it we didnt make a
move when we came past

  are you sure

  buzz nodded sure as a bunny rab-
bits tail he said we were flying up
this level valley about twenty feet off
the ground we could look over to the
right and see just a glimpse of planes
under the camouflage top

  good then tomorrow at dawn we
blast that place to bits the skipper an-
nounced you birds can take a rest for
the remainder of the day-no wait well
have two more patrols this afternoon

  buzz and the boys looked kind of sour

  i want the patrols to continue map
one patrol about five miles east of the
enemy base the skipper said then
another about ten miles on the other side
that will give them the idea that we
havent spotted them yet

  well we didnt think much more about
doc bowker until he came back about
noon just in time for mess bill and i
were on our way to mechanics mess as
a matter of fact and bill was the guy that
spotted doc coming through the gate onto
the field

  would you look at that rooster strut
bill said

  i couldnt help noticing it he was
walking like he had springs in his heels
i said something has happened to that
guy but good hes stepping higher than
a brush salesman just out of pep meet-
ing

  bill and i ambled around so wed pass
doc on our way to chow it isnt always
that a flying officer spills his inner
thoughts to a greaseball but doc i guess
couldnt hold in any longer and since we
were the first ones on the field that he
saw he spilled

  it was her cousin doc says loud
enough to hear down to headquarters
youda thought hed just won a dog-
fight it was her cousin hes the great
french ace captain charles guyne

  he breezed past and we could hear him
breaking the glad tidings to one and all
that he met as he went on toward chow

  but bill and i just stood there shaking
our heads we started walking again and
after a while bill says you never can
tell how dumb a guy is until a dame nails
him

  aint it the truth i said why that
cousin gag is so old it has got moss on
the north side

  of course if we were all brothers and
stuff like that we should be feeling very
sorry about doc getting taken in like this
but if any of the pilots did feel sorry for
him they showed it by laughing boy
how they laughed and it was twice as
funny because doc was very sincere and
positive that there was no chance of his
lili ever lying to him why she was
even going to come and visit the field
this very afternoon and bring her cousin


g- and his battle aces

captain guyne with her and he would
maybe inspect our equipment and the
field

  this of course would be quite an honor
and we all began getting ready for this
break

  bill meantime kept kind of silent dur-
ing the afternoon like he was thinking
about something i asked him once what
was eating him and he said he was just
thinking about something and if it
hatched hed tell me about it

ell the boys left on the first after-
noon patrol about one-thirty they
came back in an hour and we worked on
the planes and had them warmed up for
a three-thirty patrol and they went out
again

  all the spads got back about four-
thirty and everybody was okay we were
always glad of that

  it was about five or a little after when
up comes a carriage to the gate it is
one of those french cabs like they drive
down the boulevard in paris and the
dames and their guys sit there like theyre
on parade and not taking a ride just for
fun thats the way this carriage came
onto the field

  we all recognized lili in the seat and
she has this silly little black lace parasol
over her to shut out the sunshine beside
her is this french officer he is very
good looking as frenchmen go a big
guy and kind of a combination floor-
walker and georges carpentier maybe on
the floor-walker side slightly

  we see this when he gets out and helps
lili down and doc bowker comes over
and helps too like horatio at the bridge
or maybe i mean sir walter raleigh at
the puddle

  anyway they get out and then i- get
the drift a little of bill being silent he
nudges me and he says thats him
thats captain guyne all right

  well i dont pay much attention be-
cause the guy looked like guyne to me
too with all the pictures of this great
french ace that had been around in pa-
pers and magazines you couldnt miss
him so i think nothing more about bill
acting queer and saying those things until
we are working on our planes just out-
side our hangar and captain lacey and

captain guyne are walking by with doc
and his dame trailing behind

  captain guyne pauses here and there
to say something in his french english
and when he gets pretty close bill my
partner says beaucoup oui oui real
loud

  i jumped this captain guyne might
think bill was making fun of his french
and that wouldnt be good

  but the frenchman didnt turn around
or pay any attention

  i says to bill have you gone nuts
brother  that guy will come over and bat
your ears down if he thinks you are mak-
ing cracks at him

  now what do you think the guy does
like i was in china or maybe hoboken
he lets out another yip and its the same
as the first he says beaucoup oui
oui and this time he says it louder

  well you know me tending to my
own business so i dont get into trouble
i turn around and am working like this
and that in case the fireworks should
start for this captain guyne cannot
help but hear bill shouting this time and
i do not want him to think that i am doing
it

  but nothing happens i turn around
in a minute to sneak a look and there goes
guyne and captain lacey right on down
the line like nothing was happening

  right then bill says thats funny
and he looks like he is lost in the middle
of a chinese puzzle

  funny i cannot help but exclaim
that is positively nuts and the next time
you think youre going to try to get me
in a jam you can think again because-

  keep your shirt on joe bill says
i was trying something with this cap-
tain guyne

  ill say you were trying something
i tell him you were trying to get a
firing squad to puncture your left breast
pocket whats the idea lame-brain

  well you see bill says it hap-
pened before i teamed up with the th
and got to be your loving partner in
grease i was very young and eager in
them days and was learning my french
worse than i thought but enthusiasti-
cally

  sooo- i prompted him

  well i was stationed at a french
keep em spying



field when i first landed and i had been
studying my french book and such along
with mechanics and nuts and bolts and the
like and this captain charles guyne was
there then he was already an ace with
about nine enemy planes to his credit
this i says trying to act melodra-
matic is a portion of your sordid past
which you have not revealed to me wil-
liam

  i got lots of em he says anyway
i was doing some work for this captain
and he was a very nice guy then and
when he would ask me something in his
french english i would answer in my
best french which consisted at that time
of about four or five words

  brother you learn slow dont you
i said thats about all the french you
know now

  bill ignores me and goes on he says
well id always answer his questions
with beaucoup oui oui  he laughed
that tickled captain guyne so he got to
calling me beaucoup oui ouit and now
i thought i would spill it and he might
remember

  i shook my head apparently he
doesnt i said

  yeah bill said kind of sad that
guys about the greatest ace in france
now and i guess hes forgot me and
everything else back in the old days

so we went on working and the cap-
tain and the frenchman went on out
of sight and we let it go at that that is
i let it go but bill didnt

  i guess it was before mess and we
were leaving when he said there comes
captain guyne again hes alone im
going to speak to him

  well i waited it was getting dark and
this captain guyne was sauntering along
from one hangar to another like he was
inspecting the place all by himself

  when he gets to our hangar bill sa-
lutes and says beaucoup oui oui cap-
tain guyne

  the captain looks at him nods and
salutes and is passing by and bill says
you dont remember me it was at
sarnou a long time ago

  the captain looks at him sharp and
then smiles and says oui of course you
are a-

  mechanic bill said

  yes of course i remember you how
are you

  fine sir bill said and he saluted
and the captain saluted and that was all
there was to it

  during mess i said well now youve
had your little visit with your old beau-
coup oui oui are you satisfied

  not entirely bill said but he didnt
say anything more and after mess we
had to work on into the night to be sure
that all the spads were ready to go out
next morning at dawn

  we went to bed later without seeing
anything more of captain guyne and
then we got up very early and got the
spads warmed for the raid saw that the
bombs were in the racks and then we
watched the spads take off

  as bill and i stood there he says sud-
denly to himself dogonnit that isnt
captain guyne

  what i almost shouted

  that isnt captain guyne bill says
thats a guy who looks like him and acts
like him but not enough

  are you sure

  positive bill says he didnt talk
or smile or laugh like guyne it isnt
him

  so what i says hes some other
guy who is cutting doc out with this
dame lili

  whats he doing pretending to be cap-
tain guyne bill said

  who cares i said and then it struck
me and i said hey holy gee thats
right if he isnt guyne who is he

  ive been trying to figure that one
out bill said

  well this is a fat time to figure out
that he isnt guyne after our spads have
taken off i told him how do we know
that the guy didnt do something to those
spads last night while he was around
here

  they warmed up and ran okay just
now and they got off bill said

  just then the telephone bell rang and
it was an officer up at the front saying that
one of our planes had come down in his
area it seemed to have run out of gaso-
line and the pilot had asked him to send
a crew up to make repairs the pilot was
buzz hartin


g- and his battle aces

  well bill and i told the skipper that
and what bill had realized about guyne
and we left the skipper coming to a boil
and started off toward the front in the
wrecker truck

  the road was all mud and full of ruts
and the old wrecking truck just hobbled
along because we had to drive her care-
fully to make her hold together at all on
this rough road

  we didnt hear any sounds of engines
until wed got about four miles away from
the field and then came the rumble of a
hisso but it wasnt running good bill
and i being the best mechanics this side
of issoudon could tell that easy

  this hisso was hitting on all eight
but she didnt have any zip to her she
sounded as if she was running at half
throttle only now and then shed cough
like her throat was dry

  the spad was too far away for us to
tell whose ship it was but we were sure
it belonged to one of our pilots

  we got a few glimpses of it and then
it ducked down and we didnt hear the
roar any more and we were afraid it had
gone down before it got back to our field

  all this stuff is a pain in the neck to
a mechanic because it is his job to keep
those planes in repair and keep em fly-
ing as we say now so bill and i felt
very bad about this business of our planes
going down

  we didnt see a sign of any other planes
on the way a couple of dhs thundered
over but they belonged to another out-
fit

  when we got up near the front we
found buzz hartin sitting on what had
been a stone fence before the war now
it was just a pile of rocks he had a half-
dozen infantrymen around him and was
filling them with the well-known old
baloney about flying heroes and such

  buzz looked at us like wed come late
on purpose and he said if youd heen
two days longer we could have spent
christmas together what did you birds
do crawl in on your hands and knees

  we ignored him and went to work to
find out why the spad wasnt clicking

  its just like my gas line was turned
off buzz said only any fool can see
that it isnt even you could tell that
joe

  well of course the gas line wasnt
turned off and it wasnt like the line
was shut off either we took the car-
buretor jet cover off and peeked in and
the bowl was full of gas so we turned
her over and she started up nice as you
please

  and knowing buzz very well i could
say brother it looks like you were
taking your well-known afternoon nap
but did you have to call us way up here
over the rocky road to dublin to wake you
up sir

  i would have you know my short-
feathered friend buzz says indignant
that this was no rest cure i was on when
it happened i was flying along with the
others and we were all ready to blast
uncle wilhelm out of hiding when hen-
rietta gives a couple of sneezes and down
we come

i have perhaps forgotten to mention
that in landing on the rough territory
back of our front buzz had done his
spad  good to the extent of a wrecked
landing gear a cracked wing-tip and
what goes with it by the time we got
there the infantry had hoisted the nose
up on some ammunition cases and the
prop having stopped straight across hadnt
been damaged

  well propped up on the cases and
running sweet as a dream about a blonde
it made buzz look very silly

  you can see how sweet she runs i
says and with that the hisso says ka-
chow-kaplunk-ugh  and stops cold

  buzz kind of grins and says well
gentlemen this is where i came in ill
be running back in yon motorcycle side-
car see you boys next spring

  so he left us the louse and it was
evening before bill and i got that spad
apart and loaded on the truck and back to
the field

  by now seems like lots of things had
happened back there word had come
in during the day that every one of our
pilots had gone out and run short of
gasoline but with their tanks full and
their racks loaded with bombs

  doc bowker of all guys was the only
one who had got back to the field that
had been doc wed seen getting back and
hed just made the field by an eyelash
keep em spying



  his mechanics had found his gas line
plugged with something queer like a
thick jelly substance that strung out kind
of like a snake and stuck in the lead-off
pipe

  well doc of course was still boiling
and by the time we got there he and cap-
tain lacey had figured out that maybe this
dame and the guy she called her cousin
had had something to do with it

  so while bill and i stripped the tank
assembly of buzzs ship and a couple of
others that were being dragged in captain
lacey and doc bowker went into town to
see what they could see

  we found the stoppage all right and it
was just like theyd found in docs gas
line just like this kind of a jelly rope
that had plugged the line like a poisoned
snake had got stuck there

  the rest of the crates were being
brought in and they were a sorry lot
wings cracked and landing gears busted-
and then we got the bad news that some-
body had seen jack petley go down be-
hind the german lines seems he was
too far over when the line plugged and
he couldnt get back that was all any-
body knew

  the more things that happened the
madder we got and so the whole personnel
was pretty hopping by the time captain
lacey and doc bowker and buzz har-
tin got back with this guy who called
himself captain charles guyne

  we figured of course that if they did
find him at joliere theyd have his head
knocked off by the time they got him back
to the field

  so we got the shock of our lives when
we saw the skippers car roll through the
gate and saw the whole gang laughing and
carrying on like a pack of drunken hye-
nas

  i guess maybe twenty minutes must
have passed and then buzz hartin came
down to our hangar and said come on

up to headquarters got a little party
on and i got you boys in on it

  look buzz bill says there is a
fishy smell around here what goes
its a gag that doc worked up buzz
says we want you to come down and
have a drink or two and then-bill you
said you used to know him

  bill nods as were already walking
toward headquarters

  the skipper wants you to start talk-
ing about where you used to know the real
guyne can you do that

  for a drink bill says brightening
i can do almost anything almost

  so there we are at headquarters and
this frenchman kind of sobers up and
looks at us as though he isnt sure what
goes on bill doesnt look at him but
takes the drink that doc is handing him
and i get one too it is very good cog-
nac and i nurse mine along and just sit
back and watch bill and this frog

  i get the idea the frog thinks he recog-
nizes bill as the guy who spoke to him
before but he isnt too sure then bill
starts talking to him do you remember
back at- and stuff like that

  well that goes on for a little while
and im getting bored and i have another
drink and start getting sleepy and then
all at once i hear a plane

  right away i know that the engine i
hear is no french machine but should be
marked made in germany because it
is a mercedes and no mistake

  i get to my feet and say listen thats
a fokker

   bill says and its coming in to land
well everybody else gets excited and
next thing we know the plane has landed
and there is jack petley hes got a
touch of blood here and there and looks
kind of weak so they bring him into head-
quarters

  a surgeon comes up from the field
hospital and takes care of jack where
he has been nicked and nibbled at by

g- and his battle aces

german bullets here and there seems he
has overheard some stuff and has managed
to escape and steal a german plane and
fly back

  well as jack talks i see that all at once
captain lacey has taken out his shooting
iron and has our french friend covered

  i learned that an enemy agent located
here has everything arranged jack says
seems there is a special base south of
paris that the hidden german squadron
wants to blast its the storage space for
the new lewisite gas weve brought over
the wind will be right tonight at mid-
night and they figure to come over and
blow it up then the gas will roll right
over paris and kill everybody there
the frenchman went white and then
he exploded that is impossible that
gas storage place is too far away the
german bombers cannot fly that far

jack petley grins kind of weakly
at him and he says thats where
you come in q-nine at least i assume
youre the q-nine i heard the krauts
talking about you are to have arrange-
ments made for refuelling at a certain
field east of paris you have already
bribed certain frenchmen to have gaso-
line waiting there for the german ships
you have a wireless somewhere near
here and as the german bombers go over
you will wireless them directions to the
field in code

  that is a lie the frog said

  for your own good lacey said and
there was frost on his words youd better
start talking

  i do not know what you mean the
frog stammered

  youll soon find out lacey coun-
tered youve been drinking out of one
bottle tonight the rest of us if you re-
member havent touched it we sus-
pected you were the man we wanted so
we poisoned that bottle of liquor

  he swallowed and lacey laughed at
him

  i think youre going to talk he said
there is an antidote for the slow poison
youve been drinking tell us what we
want to know and you get the antidote
if you dont tell us in three hours you
wont ever tell because youll be dead by
that time and what kind of flowers will
you have

  i never saw a guy turn so white i
didnt know they could the frog starts
gibbering

  now he turned to the frog again
who we realized by now was more german
than french youll take us to the wire-
less set and show us how to operate it
and you will now produce the code book
which you planned to use for this job
oui oui the guy says fishing it out
of a pocket up behind his coat

  come on lacey said motioning with
his automatic lets go

  doc bowker stayed at the desk he was
writing stuff on a pad bill and i waited
for him while buzz hartin went ahead
with the skipper

  when doc finished writing we followed
him out and caught up with lacey and
the frog and buzz pretty soon we got
to the woods with flashlights to help and
there in a box that was buried under a
pile of leaves was the wireless set

  captain lacey and buzz hartin took
the frog back and bill and doc and i
stayed there by the wireless

  i havent figured out any of this
much i said while we waited to hear the
german bombers come over was there
poison in that liquor

  doc squeezed out a little laugh because
he was pretty mad in the main naw
he said nothing but good liquor in that
bottle but the frog thought it was
poisoned or he was scared to think it
wasnt

  whats the skipper going to give him
for an antidote i asked

  doc chuckled a special mickey finn
for a while hell be scared it will kill
him and then hell be scared that it wont
hell be feeling so bad he wont even
care when they turn him over to intelli-
gence the judge advocate prison and a
firing squad

  it kind of hurt me to say it but i got
it out finally i says i suppose lili
will end up in a mess like that too

  ill say she will the two-timing
double-crossing heinie spy doc says
mad enough to dent the galley stove lid
with his teeth what a sucker i was i
told her everything she asked me if i
ever look at another woman i hope one
of you guys shoots me

  right i said and ill catch the
dame on the rebound but it sure seems
keep em spying



too bad to spoil a good thing like lili
with a firing squad

  shell likely get twenty years in the
jug doc says and that will be com-
muted a year after the war ends by the
general she gets to marry her

  all at once we were still as nothing
-we could hear the rumplers churning
toward us lets go doc says

  i began cranking the generator and
bill held the code book and the message
that doc had worked out doc himself
began working the key sending a code
message i couldnt figure out

  he stopped finally and mopped his fore-
head with his sleeve

  that should hold the huns he said
but for a wihle i thought we were sunk
then he started to tell us the rest

  we sure looked like goners when
every plane but mine turned up a wreck
doc said then i got to figuring this
thing out and when i ran up against
a stone wall jack petley came in with
the dope that hed learned in germany
but even then i couldnt quite put all the
pieces together we couldnt do a thing

because we only had one or two spads
that frog had worked everything out
against us very neat

  doc was getting dramatic

  then i thought of that wireless mes-
sage he was going to direct the german
bombers to a field where they could re-
fuel in the night so i wrote instructions
to be sent to another field and left them
on captain laceys desk hell see that
everything is set at the field i men-
tioned i wirelessed the german bomb-
ers directions to that field and when they
get there boy will they find a reception
when they all get down theyll find a
flock of yanks with hand machine guns
waiting for them instead of tins of gaso-
line being dished out by thugs who have
sold out for cash to the germans

  he sighed but you know he said
theres only one thing wrong with this
whole business

  whats that i asked

  they wouldnt let me work on jack
petley when he came back all banged up
i coulda done a better job than that sur-
geon

afraid   

 y trap
for the
falcon

 an adventure of the red falcon

 with the speed of a searchlight
 team slashing into darkness the
 crimson plane of the red falcon
 charged through the night for another
 raid

   the pilot was barry rand he was
 wanted by the firing squads of his bitter
 enemies the germans as well as those
 from his own side of the lines he was a
 man without a country this dashing yank
 renegade and death leered at him from
 every quarter
sky trap for the falcon



  behind him crouched a huge black form
it was sika the gigantic senegalese negro
chief who had been- found by barry rand
after wandering from his french sene-
gal regiment crazed by shock and wounds
then in a hideout in the vosges moun-
tains rand had nursed the giant chief
back to health

  these two were a strange pair they
had worked wonders in building a plane
out of parts of other planes that had been
wrecked in the rugged depths of the vos-
ges mountains the wings were from a
spad and would hold together in a dive
the fuselage was from a german fokker

forth in his favorite song his feet tap-
ping the rudder bar in time to the raggy
tune

    ill be down to get you in a taxi
  honey better be ready bout halj past
  eight 

  master sikas voice came through
with a pleading note why you always
do dangerous work  why not you shoot
sometimes and let sika do dangerous
fighting

  and let you have all the fun the
red falcon chuckled think im crazy
always you joke master

  why not rand laughed i got a

doomed to dfie by firing squad at dawn the red falcon fought his
greatest battle for the right to answer the challenge of that flaming
death trap in the sky-which no plane could approach and survive

d- it was of light steel tubing welded
together with infinite german skill a
second cockpit had been built behind the
pilots seat so that the giant sika could
balance the great weight of the liberty
engine on the nose there were certain
tricks to flying this sleek crate which
barry rand had mastered and later taught
sika

  no markings appeared on this death
crate no circles crosses or signs of any
kind to make it allied or german it was
painted a brilliant red the color of blood
from rudder-tip to prop-spinner and
there was scarcely a soldier the length and
breadth of the world war fronts who did
not know that plane as the red falcons

  now as they roared from their secret
field atop the flat surface of saar moun-
tain in the vosges sikas voice came
through the speaking tube

  master you know where we get fuel
and ammunition tonight

  not yet big boy rand shot back
well get to that after we are over the
german lines

  but master the gauge say empty
already

  that means we have enough gas for
ten minutes rand said

  he threw back his head and bellowed

theory big boy when i laugh i can check
that to my credit and no matter what hap-
pens from then on i have had that laugh
and no one can take it away from me

  he threw back his head in a roar of
laughter

  master

  the laughter of the red falcon was
cut off short except for the churning of
the liberty engine there was silence

  two pairs of eyes stared through the
darkness at a brilliant crimson light far
ahead and high in the sky over german
territory

the red falcon knew that this could
be no planet it was something new
to him and it smacked of danger and ad-
venture challenging him to test his skill
his nerves and his fighting ability

  automatically the red falcon shifted
the direction of his plane heading it
straight for that red light in the sky

  neither spoke for a while then barry
rand cracked that looks like something
which needs investigation are you game
sika

  we get in fight master there was
a vibrant feeling in the giants deep voice
for no one in the world loved a fight bet-
ter than sika chief of the wampana


g- and his battle aces

  never can tell about that rand said
but we usually dont end up at some tea
party

  you not forget the gasoline master

  how can i with that word empty
staring me in the face rand said i
figure weve got enough to get to the red
light

  and after that master

  you worry too much big boy

  rand drew back on the throttle a little
to get the most out of the little gasoline
left he knew well the fate that lay before
them if they went down inside of ger-
many theyve had forced landings be-
fore but luck was always with them
however some day it might run out on
them but that was something he would
never admit to sika or anyone

  barry rand was trying to fathom the
mystery of the light studying it with
his keen eyes as yet he was too far away
to make a guess-a beacon perhaps by
which german planes could chart their
positions in the night hed heard of such
a thing on the sea and the same stunt
might be used over land

  then he thought of another angle which
sika at the moment put into words when
he said master maybe it be a trap for
you

  rand laughed you flatter us he
said

  you joke always sika moaned you
do not realize how far germans would go
to capture you

  but the red light looked more and more
like some kind of a lure to draw them or
some other night pilots there was some-
thing intensely fascinating about it it
was large in size so that it could be seen
even far back of the american front the
light would surely draw allied planes if
for no other reason than to satisfy their
curiosity

  suddenly a flash appeared in the sky
like the exploding of a gasoline tank and
in the light of the flash a plane seemed
to be falling apart rand could see the
section of a wing of a nieuport go down

  then it was dark again except for that
dim glow one thing baffled barry the
crimson glow shed no illumination it was
visible from a distance but yet gave no
light to see by

  rand swung farther north he was

close enough now to see that it was sus-
pended by some object above

  what happen to that plane which ex-
plode master

  that was a nieuport it struck some-
thing in the air before it got to the red
light

  then we strike one any time master

  im not sure i had a hunch some-
thing like that might be in the air thats
why i decided to come around behind it
we havent hit it yet-

  those words were barely out of his
mouth when the liberty coughed and died

  rand sat rigid he stared about in the
darkness for some landing place he
didnt want to drop a flare that would
show the germans where he was landing
but the red light in the sky had caused
his eyes to become temporarily blinded to
the darkness about him

  he turned directly away from the light
and began gliding down

  dump out a flare big boy rand said
calmly

  but master-

  dump it out rand insisted i know
the heinies will see where we go down
but we cant help that you wanted a
fight didnt you

  yes master

  well youre going to get it

the flare plopped open lighting up the
world that was directly beneath them

  rand could see a field large enough to
land the red falcon plane at the edge of
a blacked-out town he nosed down for
the spot and cut the switch and throttle
from force of habit

  as the flare settled on its little para-
chute rand switched his eyes from the
field to the running masses of german
troops pouring out of the town he saw
trucks and cars start up in various streets
of the town

  this is going to be a good fight mas-
ter the giant black cried as he swung
his twin lewis machine guns on their
scaarf mountings rand brought the crim-
son plane gliding into the field and heard
a voice above the sound of the wind that
sang a dirge through the bracing wires

  the red falcon the exclamation
came harshly in german

  the lewis guns at the back cockpit
sky trap for the falcon



bucked and chattered and the german
sprawled where he had been running
nice shooting rand called to sika
sika low on bullets the giant black
reminded him

  ive been thinking of that rand ad-
mitted maybe-

  sika interrupted pointing behind them
at the two roads that ran to the south
one a paved highway and the other a
parallel country lane on which a steady
stream of cars were moving

  ive been thinking rand said calmly
it might be well to surrender without a
fight sika what do you think

  sika not know said the giant black
sika like to fight there was bitter dis-
appointment in his voice

  were surrounded big boy rand
said we havent a chance to pull out
without gas theyll have us covered in a
few moments

  sika kill those germans with lewis
guns only a dozen master

  but there are hundreds of them on all
sides rand reminded him

  sika not afraid to die the giant black
said

  neither am i if it will do any good
said rand but weve got work to do in
this war and we wont be any good six
feet under

  master you know best sika replied
what i do

  theyve got a machine gun set up at
the east side of the field face that way
and hold up your hands while i bring
her in

  yes master sikas voice was choked
with disappointment

  a burst of machine-gun fire and glow-
ing tracers flashed before the nose of the
red falcon plane as rand brought it in
he turned in his seat and looked at sika
the giant black was standing as ordered
great arms held high over his head

  the sputter of machine-gun fire stopped
short a half-dozen germans with drawn
lugers came running from the thicket
at the edge of the field and raced towards
them

  barry rand could see the fright and
uncertainty on the faces of the germans
they bore flashlights

   hande hochl a german sergeant
barked

  they climbed from the cockpit and with
the mass of germans growing thicker they
were marched across the field to a wait-
ing truck with armed guards the truck
then moved toward the town the other
cars falling in behind

rphis look very bad sika said in
a a low voice think they kill us
anyway 

  rand shrugged as one of the german
guards a big fellow with an ugly red
face shoved a flashlight at rands face
and demanded what goes on here
what is he saying

  nothing that you shouldnt hear
rand told him he was saying that we
were captured for good and that this time
there was no chance for escape

  that is good you will save yourself
an earlier death by not trying to make
trouble 

  the truck began climbing a hill at the
west side of the town the road circled
around the hill as it climbed and then
at the top the truck stopped they were
ordered out of the truck before an old
castle of some german barony the in-
terior was much as one might expect-
old furniture great vaulted ceilings and
heavy timbers

  in the second room beyond the recep-
tion hall a german major waited for
than he was a pompous fellow short
thick-set with a mustache that was turned
up at the ends in kaiser fashion his hair
cropped close

  so he said we caught you in our
trap you are known as the red falcon
ni-cht wahr

  he glanced from sika to the waiting
barry rand

  you seem to be good at guessing
games rand said can you guess how
we happened to be caught in your trap
as you call it

  a lieutenant stepped up and saluted
bitte herr major he said with a click
of his heels these two were not exactly
caught in the trap they simply came
down and landed inside our lines

rand nodded and smiled at the per-
plexed look on the majors face you
see we just dropped in for a call
enough of this nonsense the major
barked you ac our prisoners no mat-


 and his batle aces

ter how you got here you were caught
like the american predicted a friend of
yours i believe

  rand looked puzzled a friend of
mine-predicted-

  the major nodded and got up he mo-
tioned to the guards who stood behind
barry rand and sika

  take them he ordered

  the red falcon and his giant black
aide followed by the guards with bayo-
nets marched down a hallway descended
a broad stairway and then were led
through another corridor

  the major came to a halt and jerked
his head toward a heavy oak door

  this is the chamber he barked put
them in there

  one of the guards stepped forward and
unlocked the door

  barry rand felt a sharp twinge in his
back and lunged forward and away from
it instinctively the charge sent him
through the door and into the dark dun-
geon chamber

  sika came after him and the majors
arrogant voice snapped you may as
well spend the rest of the night together
you three will be shot at dawn as spies
the door boomed shut and the great
key rasped in the lock

barry rand had seen no one else
inside the dungeon cell yet the
major had said that all three would be
shot he glanced about the dark interior
of the chamber there was only a tiny
beam of light filtering through the key-
hole and another along the crack of the
door

sikas voice broke the silence master
another man over here chained to wall
then a voice from the corner behind
rand called out softly barry is that

you

  the red falcon turned to the direc-
tion of the voice

  who are you

  i think youll remember me the voice
said weakly remember johnny davis in
your old outfit

  johnny rand was fumbling in the
dark his hands touched a silky fabric
and instinctively drew back

  hey what goes on here

  theyve got me hung up to dry

johnny davis voice came to him get
me down and ill tell you all about it
sure rand said give me a hand
sika but these silks johnny whats the
idea

  thats just my red silk pajamas re-
member

  rand whistled low in the dark i
always told you those red silk pajamas
would get you in trouble some time
the red falcon turned to his giant
aide johnny here was a friend of mine
back in our old outfit he had a passion
for silk pajamas-red ones-and when he
was late for patrol hed hurry out of bed
and pull on his flying suit over the
pajamas

  turning to the young man trussed up
on the wall he asked thats what hap-
pened this time

  yeah johnny said in disgust and
now the heinies are going to shoot me
as a spy because they claim i was wear-
ing a disguise and not my regular uni-
form

  rand chuckled low they call those
red pajamas of yours a disguise why
its a wonder i didnt spot it in the dark
with sikas help rand had the chains
loosened and johnny davis was standing
beside them on the stone floor of the
dungeon

  the whole place was chilly and musty
smelling johnny was shivering in his silk
pajamas and barry rand offered his coat

  thanks pal said johnny boy am
i glad to see you i was scared to death
that id killed you

  how is that johnny how could you
kill us from this tomb

  johnny davis hobbled as he moved
now let me sit down

  sure pull up a chair rand said
same old barry said johnny there
arent any chairs in this subway but theres
a pile of straw over in the corner

  he limped as he made his way over
with barry rand holding his arm to aid
his movements

why arent you in a hospital
 rand demanded after they sat
down

  i guess i didnt make reservations
with the heinie nurses johnny said
anyway a slug just nicked my leg they
sky trap for the falcon



bandaged it up before they put me in
here

  i was shot down this morning they
had me in a room under guard for a long
time sometimes i could hear what they
said and sometimes i couldnt

  yeah but how did you almost kill
us rand asked

  im getting to that johnny went on
i heard them talking about a light they
were going to try out tonight i couldnt
hear all the things they said but from
what i judged they hoped to attract some
of our planes into or near the light it
wasnt until id suggested trapping you
that i found out they had wires in the air
to catch our planes

  well they began talking about some-
thing else theres a big drive on by our
boys tomorrow morning at dawn the
worst part of it is that the germans know
this and are ready for the drive do you
know where that queer mountain is in the
arras sector  they call it hill  thats
a laugh

  i know it very well rand said its
what they call a mesa out west meaning

a table it goes straight up for about three
hundred feet and you cant climb the thing
or the heinies would have had gun place-
ments on it long ago

  could you and sika land on that flat
top with a load of time bombs asked
johnny

  barry rand thought awhile then he
said yes if the job were urgent
enough

  it is davis said in fact the only
hold-up that the germans fear is that you
would be free to land there and plant some
bombs from what i heard there are deep
cracks along the west cliff at the top if
some time bombs were dropped down
those cracks it would blow up that whole
side of the cliff

  rand shrugged it would be a cute
job but whats to be gained

  youd kill thousands of german
troops johnny whispered isnt that
enough you were always a hog about
killing germans

  for a forced landing job before break-
fast it might do rand grinned

  then youll do it

the phantom of the black cross was a friend of all the allies
save one-the brother he had sworn to kill

g- and his battle aces

got a ticket out of here rand asked
you mean you cant get out why
all the guys back at the outfit had you two
figured as being able to get out of any-
thing

  thanks rand said drily but listen
what are those heinies doing under the
cliff and how do you know

  i heard the german command talking
about it and hoping you wouldnt get the
idea to come over and blast them those
german troops are hiding under the cliff
until our drive starts at dawn then theyll
make a surprise counterattack and break
up our whole show

  so- rand still didnt understand
when they let me talk johnny hur-
ried on i told them they might trap you
with the light i said i hated you because
you were a traitor you see i had to pre-
tend i wanted to see you caught

  and you did rand grinned but
not for what they thought

  certainly not johnny exploded
you know im for you one hundred
percent

  i always figured that thanks john-
ny

  dont mention it sweetheart i had
to get you here so i could give you the
dope can you do it barry

  rand chuckled so the gang thinks
sika and i are a couple of magicians
sure you cant let us down now if
that german counterattack is a success
they may even take over the old field
barry rand nudged his giant black aide
go around to the left sika and see if
you can find a way out of here

  yes master

  rand started around the other way
johnny got up from the straw pile and
followed rand i know where the gas-
oline stores are if you need gas

  no kidding

  saw that from the air johnny said
before they shot me down

good boy if we land you back at the
home base do you think you could talk
the co out of some time bombs for us
id sure try but you might get some
bombs here

  well get you back rand said i
dont like that leg of yours anyway
whats the use of leaving you here for a
heinie firing squad 

  yeah johnny said drily sure
would be too bad to let the heinies waste
bullets on me like that

from the other side of the dungeon
cell came a very faint clanging sound
as of metal striking against rock rand
froze there

  whats that

  me master sikas voice hissed

  rand held davis by the arm and moved
across the dungeon floor sika loomed in
the darkness before him he was bend-
ing down scraping with something

  find place where mortar is loose be-
tween stones master sika said one
stone out of wall already but guard out-
side

  barry felt the hole in the wall that sika
was noiselessly making the wampana
chief was working with an iron bar he
had torn out of the stone wall

  the hole grew larger and now rand
was helping too a ray of light slanted
in through cracks in the rocks

  the red falcon whispered to his aide
doesnt that guard know were breaking
through

  not yet master sika fix him

  the faithful black worked on then
when the hole was large enough to let his
great shoulders pass he reached a hand
out and drew it back something moved
outside

  by the light that came in through the
hole barry and johnny could see every-
thing quite clearly sika bent down and
crawled through the opening he had made
in the wall there was a thud outside and
the sound of a voice

  with a sudden backward lunge he
yanked a struggling form inside through
the opening his hands somehow found
the guards throat and before he could
cry out sika choked him

  then cautiously sika crawled through
the opening into the corridor he turned
and peered in you come now master

  barry rand pushed johnny davis ahead
of him and then followed through a mo-
ment later

  they tried several doors on their way
back to the stairs the first and the sec-
ond doors were locked but the third was
easily opened it proved to be a store-
room cases of food were piled on shelves
sky trap for the falcon



they moved across the room to a low
narrow cellar window which proved to
be unlocked

  rand was first to crawl through this
time with sika helping davis then they
pulled the great giants form through the
small opening

  they trailed off into the night follow-
ing the lead of the giant black once away
from the castle grounds sika hoisted
johnny davis on his back and under
davis direction they circled the town and
made for the storage depot

  daylight was not so far away and there
was no time to be wasted the supply
depot was heavily guarded and they ap-
proached slowly by crawling on their hands
and knees as they came closer rand
turned to johnny davis you stay here
johnny sika and i will handle the job
from here on well pick you up on the
way back

  rand and sika had not gone more than
perhaps a hundred feet when a low voice
behind them suddenly commanded halt
or you will be dead

  rand stopped short cold sweat broke

out on his forehead one small move and
he could hurl the guard to the ground
but that was a big chance for the german
had a gun

  sika was a little too far away to act
quickly enough a light flashed and went
out

  get up and march ahead of me the
guards voice was still low

  in the next flash of the electric torch
rand saw the guard raise the whistle to
his lips but suddenly there was a rustle
behind them a swift move and then a
low thud the guard pitched over in the
darkness and landed half across rands
legs

  did i get him asked johnny in a
low breathless voice

they moved  together now all three
two more guards went down one be-
fore sika and one by a surprise neck-
breaking attack by the red falcon him-
self

  they finally reached the supply depot
there were drums of gasoline and plenty
of dynamite

g- and his battle aces

  rand and sika came out loaded johnny
davis tried to carry some of the supplies
but rand told him he would do well
enough to get himself to the red falcon
plane

  a lone german soldier guarded the
plane where it had been landed the gray
of dawn was appearing in the eastern sky
the giant black moved like a great cat
stalking his prey then the swift attack
the snap of the back and they were free
to load the red falcon plane

  quickly they stored the supplies in the
ample rear cockpit with gasoline sucked
into the cylinders of the liberty she
barked off and was in the air in less than
two minutes racing against time through
the early morning mists toward that table
mountain known to the allies as hill 

  barry rand spoke through the tube
now

  there wont be enough time to land
and plant that stuff he said if we
do those german troops will move right
out from under the cliff

  but you cant hit those cracks in the
rocks with dynamite any other way
davis argued youve got to land

  a slow grin spread over the red fal-
cons face

  watch sika help him get the fuse
and the caps and the dynamite ready
by now it was light enough for them
to see hill  through the morning mist
the red falcon aimed for it with the
throttle wide open

  get your eyes peeled sika rand
barked through the tube

  sika ready master

  okay see the cracks in the rock
where the dynamite must drop ill fly
so you can drop it over the right side
sika

  johnny davis tense voice yelled
through the tube fokkers coming down
off that cloud to the left

  take care of them johnny rand
ordered thats your job now sikas
going to be busy with the jelly rolls
he held the red falcon plane steady
as he came in over the cliff a burst of
wild spandau lead came crashing down
and ripped through the right wing an-
other burst sounded and the fabric near
the tail of the fuselage looked like a sieve
hold master sika ready

  the giant black bent over the side and
let go with the explosive

  rand got a glimpse of the germans
trying to run out from under the cliff
with a roar the side of the cliff tore itself
apart from the rest of hill  crumbling
as it fell masses of germans ran like
trapped rats but there was no chance of
any of them escaping in less than a min-
ute there was nothing but fallen rock

  more spandau slugs came at them the
red falcon plane was shivering from the
rattling lewis guns johnny davis let
out a yell i got that one

  the red falcon whirled in his seat and
looked back one fokker was going down
in flames and three others were trying
to catch them in their cross-fire he want-
ed to turn back and fight them all but
instead he pushed on the throttle and the
liberty engine screamed out in a burst of
speed

  hey i want another shot at those so-
and-sos davis yelled

  were taking you back to the base
hospital replied barry

  the red falcon didnt zoom his plane
over the old home field before landing
he slipped in from a long glide at the
far end of the field

  johnny davis lingered

  think nothing of it johnny rand
said be seeing you

  but wait johnny pleaded heres
our new co coming on the double
tell him some other time rand said
they could hear the voice of the run-
ning captain calling to them there seemed
nothing but friendly greeting in his man-
ner but the red falcon waved his hand
again and gunned the giant liberty en-
gine

  as they roared back to the vosges
mountains and their hideout on saar
mountain sika asked master what you
think new captain want

  maybe he wants us to come back in
the old outfit rand ventured think
we should big boy

  after a long pause the giant black chief
replied sika think we do all right-like
we are master

  you and me both the red falcon
grinned and laying his head back he gave
voice to his favorite song the dark town
strutters ball
thirty-minute ace

chuck meister was feeling as
perky as a bull pup on his first
daring excursion away from his

mother

  the world about him-blue sky white
clouds and five spads in v-formation
above shell-blasted earth-was his very
own and elegant oyster

  besides all this a nice moon with a
smiling sun shining overhead and three
enemy planes that they were about to at-
tack-chucks fingers itched and he want-

ed to scratch them on the triggers of his
twin vickers guns

  they were diving to meet the attack
of those three fokkers right now and as
their hissos screamed and the wind
shrieked through the rigging of their ships
chuck saw his flight leader turn and shoot
him a glance through his goggles

  chuck laughed ken allen was warn-
ing him about the coming fight-warning
him to follow the orders received just
before takeoff he was to dive in get

you cant tell a guy who knows better that he isnt an ace on his
first flight-youve got to write it out for him with indelible death

in flamefiled skies



there wasnt time to think   


g- and his battle aces

one clean burst at a german plane and
then break out of the fight and run for
home his first taste of blood was to be
a safe one ken allen had a reputation
for bringing up his fledglings very care-
fully on the bottle allen he was
known as around the flying fields a
nursemaid to fledglings on their first flights
over the lines but he hadnt lost a first-
flight man yei

  but chuck was dreaming of what mary
would think and feel when she heard that
he had gotten his first enemy plane-shot
it down in flames maybe two of those
fokkers out ahead would be his

  it was a thrilling thing to sit in your
cockpit and see the glistening wings of
your new spad extending on either side
of you chuck thought this is the nuts
but definitely and laughed at the back
of ken allens head before him then he
looked across the short space that sepa-
rated him from johnny willis flying mid-
dle span across from him in the formation
johnny willis another new man in the
flight looked scared that was wrong-
this was going to be duck soup he
winked at willis

  take a crack at one enemy plane and
run for it even if you didnt hit it  that
was silly after all he wasnt just any
new replacement flying the front for the
first time he had turned in the best rec-
ord at elementary flying school and then
at advanced it had been the same hed
had an almost perfect score in gunnery
he could hit anything he was sure of
himself

  almost within range now the fokkers
had seen the five spads tearing in and
were climbing for higher advantage the
five spads began climbing as well

  chuck sat hunched forward finger
poised on the triggers everything was
set he already had his first kill in his
sights this was going to be a cinch but
that running home business-that was a
laugh hed chase these babies until he
got them   

  his thoughts were interrupted by the
chatter of machine-gun fire a fokker
to the right had pulled a flashing immel-
mann and was coming back blasting at
johnny willis chuck could hear john-
nys guns chatter in a wild burst he
didnt have time to turn for a look he

still had his ship in his sights he pressed
the trigger

  he was a split second too late the
fokker before him was wriggling out be-
fore he could make his guns fire the
tracers whipped out and punched little
holes through blue sky

  chuck was angry suddenly and sent the
spad screaming to the attack he took a
special dislike to that enemy plane it
turned ducked immelmanned out of trou-
ble again and turning again ran for it

there was something about the way
that german plane fled before his
guns that sent the blood pounding through
his veins he was thrilled on edge-like
a dog that has a cat on the run

  they tore off into germany chuck
meisters spad after the fleeing german
fokker chuck leaned forward eagerly
like a hungry child at a bakery-as if
leaning forward would get him closer to
the fleeing german

  just a little closer and he could send
his bullets home the fokker was a slim
darting shape in his sights a little closer
and his slugs would reach the other and
hed score his first kill the lust of the
chase gripped him-a pleasant sensation

  but somehow that fokker didnt come
closer to him in fact chuck thought for
a while that it was getting farther and
farther away although the race was close
the heinie just seemed to keep out of
his reach and kept running

  he remembered the orders that allen
had given him-he sure wasnt on his way
home now his lips drew back in a grin
he was riding hell-bent deeper into
germany but that didnt matter-he had
plenty of gas and bullets and he was after
this guy

  he was gaining he pressed his trig-
gers and saw the tracers die away nearer
the tail of that fleeing fokker than before
another one two three minutes and hed
have the range   

  he pushed on the throttle for more
speed and noted that she was already wide
open the jerry looked behind at him
and although the distance was great
chuck thought the jerry looked scared

  suddenly the fokker flipped up in a
steep climb this was his chance chuck
pressed his triggers again and watched
thirty-minute ace



his tracers whipping out toward the climb-
ing path the fokker was taking then the
fokker finished his half loop rolled and
came tearing back to give battle

  chuck was no fool he was ready
hed climbed with the jerrys roll he
was up on a par with the other and the
spad was soupy he cut in with a burst
and missed too bad better luck next
time-and the jerry got a blast at him

  for once chuck was startled not
scared he told himself-just startled the
slugs slashed in front of him crashed in-
to and through his instrument panel no
time to take stock now something might
be hit but the oil wasnt squirting that
was what he worried about if the oil line
got cut then the old hisso wouldnt hold
out for long but the oil was right up
there he risked a split second to glance
at the gauge the needle was right

  he was thrashing his controls about in-
side the ship-but he got away he had
a feeling that his flying was a little rough
compared to the flying of this jerry and
then he got a shot-the jerry crossed his
sights or his sights caught the jerry
there wasnt time to think chuck pressed
his triggers

  tracers lashed out again and he saw
them stab into the cockpit of the fokker
he saw the pilot jerk erect in his seat
and saw his head snap back   

  that was all he had time to see then
he felt a little sorry for the guy because
he knew now how scared the other must
suddenly have become chuck had been
just a little scared himself when his in-
strument board shattered

  and then the air was suddenly filled
with fokkers and he got to be busy
after a while he realized that there were
only three of them-but battle-trained
aces they seemed a lot more

  for the first time since hed started on
this flight he thought of the well-known
maneuver of getting the heck out of there
and tried to put it into execution

bullets pounded on his wings and
his fuselage covering and his nice
shiny spad began to look like an old bat-
tered colander

  he was suddenly frightened these
birds knew their business-and his but
somehow when he caught another fokker

in his sights he managed to send a flock
of little steel-coated pills to the pilots ribs
and that fokker too dived into the place
where bad fokkers go

  then things proceeded to get very hot
and the white cloud dead ahead looked
as welcome as a feather bed to a worker
just off a double shift chuck went div-
ing into the cloud and pulled it shut be-
hind him

  when he ducked out again the sky was
clear of planes and the country below
him looked as strange as siam to a new
englander

  he looked at his gas gauge and what
he saw was not reassuring when he
checked with his wrist watch the tank
was less than half full and hed only been
out about twenty minutes it didnt make
sense then he smelled gasoline vapor
and that didnt help a spandau slug
must have nicked his tank

  there is always a very good chance
that leaking gasoline will catch fire and
burn in a very hot manner-but hed
barely got a good grip on that idea when
he smelled something else he didnt
identify the second smell until he glanced
at his compass and saw that a jerry
bullet had shattered the glass and that
the alcohol had leaked out

  the compass was useless

  to get home now would be a good trick
if he could do it but he didnt have the
faintest notion of how to start he knew
hed chased the heinie back into germany
he was sure of that from little checks
hed made on compass on the way out
now he was well into germany   he
could take his direction from the sun

  he looked for the sun and found it
directly over his head it blazed down
not smiling warmly but laughing out
loud

  he began to think about mary he
didnt know why at first-and then he
realized it was because hed miss her
pretty terribly if he died-and then he
had to laugh at the notion it was she
whod miss him-he wouldnt be wanting
anything the thought became an ache
that was the worst about dying-not to
want anything ever again

  he pulled himself together there were
other reasons for his thinking of mary
right now without intending to shed


g- and his battle aces

helped him while away many of the dull
hours in navigation-hed spent them
writing letters to her he could use some
of the study hed missed now

  all he knew about navigation was that
you could tell east from west by looking
at a compass-or the sun by day and the
stars at night and if clouds hid them
why you just climbed above the clouds
and got your bearings

  of course with him it had been differ-
ent he never forgot a face nor did he
ever forget a landmark he could re-
member the territory he had flown over-
always remember that church steeples
and towns and patches of woods with
certain shapes it hadnt occurred to him
that there might not be time to look

  so hed spent his time in navigation
classes writing to mary-well that hadnt
exactly been wasted time either for no
accountable reason he began to feel better

  well call me sure-shot charlie he
said sourly i never thought a guy could
get so snarled up

  vainly he searched the sky about him
there was not the slightest sign of planes
enemy or allied the only sign of life was
a hawk that circled down below over a lit-
tle tumbled-down barn and a stone house
that was half hidden by trees not even
any archie guns to tell him for sure that
he was over german territory

but he had to be over german terri-
tory that was a cinch hed chased
that heinie all the way back beyond the
lines before he had shot him down

  that was another thing that had him
sore hed shot down two enemy planes
and there wouldnt be anyone within ten
miles of the place who could give him
verification that perhaps was the big-
gest heartbreak of all now that he thought
of it

  on the other hand being lost was no
picnic he could double that if he didnt
manage to do something about it pretty
soon

  he looked at his gas gauge and saw the
needle sinking farther the tank was only
a quarter full the gas wasnt going into
the engine it was running out of some
spandau rathole faster than it was going
through the hisso-and that was bad

  again he thought about fire and his in-

sides fluttered hed have to make up his
mind right now and take a gamble on
sheer luck he could circle and take a
point he could spit in his palm and
slap it with his finger and go whichever
way the most spit flew

  maybe that would be best he made
another check and froze off on the
horizon he saw three specks hed been
very good at silhouettes he recognized
them as three hanover german bombers
they were heading away to his right

  frantically he went after them at
least they were planes-and if they didnt
do anything for him he could try to shoot
them down but there was another angle
the german planes were going some-
where they were bombers and either
they were going to bomb or they were
coming back from a swift daylight raid
to be sure these hanoveraners were a
two-place job that could do bombing or
observation work but usually only one
plane was sent out on reconnaisance

  no this was definite his job would
be to find out if they were going or com-
ing he didnt know that much about
himself-but those hanoveraners on the
horizon they knew where they were going
and why

  he had less than an eighth of a tank
of gasoline now he seemed to be losing
fuel faster than before perhaps a seam
had been opened by the vibration

  one tiling chuck noticed he was gain-
ing very swiftly on the bombers and pret-
ty soon hed have to make up his mind
whether to attack immediately or hang
around trying to find out where they
were going

  suddenly his eye caught a sparkle as a
shaft of sunlight beat down into his cockpit
and he looked down there was the leak
at a rear corner of the gasoline tank-and
he was chewing gum he took the wad
of gum from his mouth and tried to fix
the break the stream slowed for a mo-
ment but came seeping out after a few
seconds

  he got out his handkerchief and pocket
knife and used the knife blade to calk
the hole with fabric the stream slowed
to a drip

  when he lifted his head above the cowl-
ing again he was amazingly close to the
three bombers that might mean they
thirty-minute ace



were heavily loaded-and then he saw
the bombs in their racks under the wings

  he wanted to shout-and the next mo-
ment did just that they were going out
heading for an allied objective-he
gunned his ship toward them and then
archie was grunting up at him and the
sky was filled with dirty yellow mush-
rooms

  but that didnt matter because there
were the front lines he even recognized
the location as he sent the spad in a wild
zigzag course to escape the bursts he
could see the bombardiers in the rear
cockpits of the hanoveraners getting
ready to fight off his coming attack

  the hisso engine on the spad snorted
and gasped it caught and ran again the
gas gauge was almost at empty then
he was flashing over his own lines half
flying half gliding with the hisso cough-
ing and spitting

  no place to sit down even though he
was on his own side of the lines now
everything on the ground was blasted
then he saw a strip of open field below

  he could set the spad down in that field
with comfort and it would have been
elegant to step out on solid earth on his
own side of the lines but there were
those three bombers

for the first time since he joined up
chuck permitted duty to rear its rath-
er unattractive head he knew there
wouldnt be any chance for confirmation
on these three bombers he knew there
would be hell to pay if and when he got
back to his drome hed disobeyed orders
and got himself into the devils own mess
he had one chance to save his ship-that
inviting field lay just under him now and
the bombers were far enough away so
hed be out of gliding distance of the
field if he attacked

  with a surging roar the hisso seemed
to pick up in a last burst of speed as he
sent the ship charging into the fire of the
tail guns of the bombers his vickers
guns began spitting fire he had a good
record as a shot he hadnt been asleep
in gunnery class

  he blasted at one bomber until it turned
off and veered crazily-then went after
another the second ship burst into
flames just as the hisso gave a final gasp

and died he had time before he went
into a spin to see the one remaining
hanoveraner turn and head for home

  he managed to bring the spad out of its
spin and for the first time realized that
his right leg wouldnt work against the
rudder it was numb and out of control
he brought the spad in as well as he
could he didnt have much of a chance
just as he went to set her down the sec-
ond hanoveraner dug her nose into the
ground nearby and blazed fiercely as if
to keep it company chuck washed out
his landing gear against a rock that the
grass of the field had hidden and his
spad rolled over

  chuck came awake slowly enough to
realize even before he opened his eyes
that he was in a hospital then he saw
ken allen his leader looking down at
him tommy porter was standing beside
allen

  well go ahead dish out the sermon
and make it good because i need it and i
can take it he wanted to say but didnt
something held him back and then ken
allen began to speak

  ken said a lot of things including the
news that one surviving german pilot
had admitted they were coming to bomb
chucks new drome he also said that
those first two fokkers chuck had shot
down were verified by tommy porter
and tom nodded agreement

  and it seemed that the two bombers
were credited to him too the crew of a
well camouflaged anti-aircraft post behind
yank lines had seen all of it and reported

  youll get medals for this allen said
for a replacement youre not doing bad
barring not following orders at the start
but well forget that is there anything
we can get for you while youre knitting
yourself a new leg

  if you dont mind chuck said peni-
tently id like a few sheets of writing
paper just a few and as many books on
navigation as you can dig up

  porter and allen looked at him strange-
ly and nodded as they went down the
corridor chuck heard them say

  i had that guy all wrong thought
he was a wise guy

  hes nuts an ace in half an hour and
he kills time studying stuff like naviga-
tion

  now from ray ohman  n wells
st chicago 

  dear g-

     first of all let me congratulate you
  on your swell magazine ive read g-
  since i- first wa able to read in my
  opinion dont yon think there was a
  shortage of german mechanics in the
  last war every time g- escapes from
  germany some poor greaseball seems
  to get slugged by g-

     dont you think g- that you ought
  to ease up on those mechanics

     please excuse this outburst of per-
  sonal opinion but i had to know how
  the g- readers feel about this we
  ought to get up a society called the
  save the iieinie mechanics
  from horrible death by g-
  society

     keep on with those swell stories i 
  enjoy them greatly

yours for victory

                    ray ohman

  well ray i suppose i should have a
very guilty conscience about slugging all
those german mechanics but to tell the

truth i had a co-murderer in those little
killing spells

  you see while bob hogan bases his
stories on that old diary i used to keep
during world war one he has a very
wild imagination and when he lets it go
he makes me quite a fellow so when i
murder a german mechanic at times just
remember that sometimes hogan is there
holding the guys arms while i slug him
but just so we knock off the heinies eh
ray

  and now we have a chapter formed at
state college pa listen to this

  dear g-

     a bunch of us fellows got your maga-
  zine and decided to join your club here

                    billy gotherman

address

  dear g-

     i wish i could impress on your whole
  gang how very important it is to learn
  if possible the wireless code before you
  join the armed forces because i could
  send apd receive sixteen to eighteen
  words a minute when i was inducted

  i rose to the rank of tech sergeant in
  about three months less than usual
  perhaps i saved more time than that
  im not sure anyway i know im cer-
  tainly mighty glad that i learned my
  code before i went in

    happy landings to all the gang

                         ernie smith

g- speaks

  story and it was fair yes that is all
  i can say for it just fair-if that

    how about more of those fantastic
  german monster machines of destruc-
  tion i think you should keep going
  on that stuff it is far-fetched i know
  but g- youre pretty far-fetched your-
  self

    ive just written a letter to steve
  hartigan in malvern n y he is trying
  to organize an international squadron
  for lone eagles id like to get in it
  as im going to be one myself-i hope

                    maurice laumaillet
                    - booth st
                    elmhurst n y

  so our magazine is fair and you want
some monster machines even if they are
far-fetched like me eh maurice well
ive been called a lot of things by people
all over the world but this is the first
time ive been called far-fetched

  well maurice well have to send your
letter on to bob hogan and see what he
can dream up with the help of the old
diary in the way of a machine that should
be a hum-dinger

  and now we have another one of the
gang who is going into uniform listen
to this

  dear g-

     i have just read the last issue of your
  mag and i think it is swell i cant
  remember when i first read your mag
  but i believe it was back in 

     ive tried ever since to get a chapter
  together but couldnt get enough guys
  to join at last i have decided to join
  as a lone agent my coupon is enclosed

  if possible i would like to be a lone
  agent permanently

    i have only one complaint-battle
  doesnt have enough to do with the
  yarn

     yours till battle understands ameri-
  can slang

                  elmer warren jr

    ps i am  years old now and ex-
  pect to join the navy very soon e w

g- and his battle aces

 been for his perfect make-up job bull
 might have been caught and then   
 but ill let you read the story for your-
 selves

   well this should cheer you up and make
 everybody feel good its from leon
 decker of armoret texas

   dear g-s

      i wanted to thank you first for help-
    ing us form a club and giving us per-
    mission to have a club with only three
    members i was glad you understood
    that the way we live made it hard to get
    anybody else i mean it made it so we
    couldnt at all

      you see here whore we live there are
    only three ranches and they are very
    large ones and except for the cowhands
    and our fathers there arent any other
    fellows around at all so there are only
    us three boys to form a club and we
    want to thank you again for letting us
    form it just like we had five to start

      well im g- like you and it cer-
    tainly is an honor i try to run things
    just like you would g- but of course
    i know i couldnt do a job that well

      we have a clubhouse all to ourselves

    my father let us use an old bunk house
    that wasnt used for anything now
    when we were in town once we got
    some sulphur candles and we got all the
    smells ont of it with the sulphur burn-
    ing and then we cleaned it up good

      it makes a swell clubhouse and we
   have a kind of cavalry outfit since we
   dont have bicycles or planes of our own
   out here but we can take a pony when-
   ever we want to-a cow horse i mean
   to say we call the smaller ones cow
   ponies and we ride in formation when
   we ride im at point and then charlie
   and billy cover the two tips of the tri-
   angle we ride like everything and try
   hold our formation but this is very hard
   with the ponies we have for when they
   all get running real fast they want to
   race and then billys pony which he
   calls seven for he is bull his pony
   runs ahead because hes the fastest of
   the lot

      well so long g- happy landings
   and thanks

  you some pointers if you dont mind
  i have just moved here and dont know
  any other fellows so i try to content
  myself with c- and this is what is
  wrong with your mag i think

    	your magazine always has the
  same story in it over and over again i
  mean it is the same plot with different
  names and things why doesnt this
  guy hogan if he is so clever give us
  something different sometime

     	why dont you show a picture of
  battle with his famous rolling-pin

    	why dont you show a detailed
  picture of the death machine and a
  closeup of the inhuman devil who is
  opposing you

      yours until bull gets his fill for once

  well gerald them is harsh words
some of them of course we knew that
bob hogans stories followed about the
same pattern the same as a detective
book follows about the same pattern or
any other type of story for that matter
but we didnt think they were all the
same ill have to speak to bob about
this and see if he cant work out some-
thing more differenter for you gerald

  about the pictures i guess you havent
seen all the mags and all the illustrations
because im sure that many of the pic-
tures you mention have been in time and
again

  now we have a card from way out west
in california i think we should answer
these questions so the rest of you will
know too here we go

  dear g-

     i wonder if i could obtain the first
  book of your adventures i believe it
  is called the bat staffel i will pay for
  it if i can get one

     ive enjoyed all of your stories and
  i think bob hogan is a swell author i
  would appreciate it if you would send
  me a list of all the back issues before
   and i will take my pick

thanks

q and his battle aces

  about those old magazines bob i
cant tell you where you can get them
the publisher does not carry any extra
old copies and the only thing i can do is
refer you to your nearest second-hand
book and magazine store youll find such
stores in every fair-sized city try snoop-
ing around for some of those second-hand
magazine stands next time you get in to
los angeles

  heres a letter from one of the new
gang members he lives in kings moun-
tain north carolina and that is lovely
country i know because ive been there
address him on route  if you should
want to write him

  he says

  dear g-

    i have been reading your magazine
  for about a year and a half and i think
  it is the best  the market at any price

  i wouldnt miss a single issue for any-
  thing

    i am  years old and a senior in
  high school  have always been in-
  terested in flying and i read every
  aviation book that i can get my hob-
  bies are reading swimming skating
  bicycling and collecting pictures of air-
  planes i have over a thousand pic-
  tures of airplanes ranging from the
  small trainers to the huge b-

    some day i hope to pilot a fighter
  plane in the us army air force and
  take a crack at tokyo and berlin

              yours

               homer pheagin jr

  at your age homer it wont be long
before you will be flying a plane will it
but dont set your heart on a combat job
remember the boys in the bombers are
doing a swell job too in fact they may
win the war for us in large measure lots
of luck anyway homer

 and now we have some complaints
from ray bradley his letter follows

  dear g-

    i have been reading your magazine
  for two years but never got mad enough
  to write you before those stories of
  you and your battle aces are beyond
  a doubt the most fantastically fabulous
  concoctions that any human brain
  could imagine

     the other stories in your book should
  be the features while your dreams
  should take up the left-over space
  stories like the red falcon at least


g- speaks

  dont have men disappearing every time
  you change the page

     please i beg of you have at least
  one g- story that sounds possible or
  cant you get away from your imagi-
  nation i dont know why i waste
  time writing you this stuff because i
  know you wont print it it might make
  the other readers think things over and
  bring them to their senses and then
  make them slop reading the mag

     your disgusted but faithful reader

                n y

  okay pal so we all kind of smell up
the reading room do we well now ill
leave this up to the others and see what
they think and you thought we wouldnt
dare print such a letter why dont you
know that we want all our readers to
know how the others feel  even joe haw-
kins we even print the letters that joe
writes-and incidentally joe where have
you been havent seen you lately has
some jap got your tongue or something
hows for a nice crabby letter from you 

  and here is another request from a
reader out in coalinga california

  dear g-

     i like your mag very much its very
  exciting but it doesnt have enough
  dogfights and aerial combat as you
  know i am a lone agent but i have
  succeeded in getting two others to join
  my club oh one more thing couldnt
  you have your stories a bit more blood-
  ier

     g- please dont have lady spies in
  your mag

     well i will be signing off for this
  time

                   coalinga california

  betty that makes things tough for me
i wonder how the rest of you guys and
gals in the gang like or dislike r-l be-
cause bob hogan had a story coming up
soon with her and if there are too many
of you who dont want to hear about her
why then well have to do something
about it

  in real life though r-l was a swell
gal you would have liked her betty i
know she was regular and brave and had
lots of what it takes

q and his battle aces

  as for having the stories bloodier
betty well you know there are some real
quiet easily shocked people who read our
magazine you wouldnt want to scare
them to death would you 

  gang here is a nice letter of apprecia-
tion that bob hogan got from one of the
gang bob sent it to me and im going to
pass it on to you

  dear mr hogan

     i received your letter with niy char-
  ter and everything to tell you the
  honest truth i never expected a letter
  from you i was under the impression
  that when you wrote to a magazine it
  was glanced at and tossed in the waste-
  basket however i see that i was wrong
  and wish to express my appreciation of
  the fact that you took the time to an-
  swer me

    i have read g- and his battle aces
  a long time in fact it was the first
  magazine that i ever read i first
  started late in  and havent missed
  an issue since probably the best thing
  about g- is that it is always good of
  course some stories are better than
  others but they are all good your
  magazine first got me interested in
  aviation which i now follow closely

  i also build models and i have several
  world war i craft

    i was sick with rheumatic fever not
  long ago-matter of fact i still am-

  i am writing this in bed and i cant tell
  you how much pleasure g- gave me
  but i had to read old ones over again
  on aecount of this bi-monthly stuff

     before i got sick i was very active in
  all kinds of sports being captain of
  our schools four major sports that
  was back in  before i became a
  bed-bug

    im afraid i will have to remain a
  ixmo agent until another year rolls
  round the reason is that very soon
  im going to florida for the winter and
  then up to michigan for the summer
  all because of a germ however i al-
  ready have plans under way for a
  chapter and i feel sure ill have one
  by next year this time

    i sincerely hope i havent bored you
  too much with this letter best of luck
  to you and continued success

     yours till herrings holy

                 chad oliver
                  ledgewood
                 cincinnati
                 ohio

  isnt that a swell letter gang it was
g- speaks

 written some time ago but just got around
 to getting into the mag that may be the
 way with your letter so keep watching
 for it

   nice going chad hope youre doing
 fine now but just to make sure-how
 about a lot of you gang writing chad a
 card send him a picture postcard of
 your home town or something and write
 him a note on the back wishing him luck

   dear g-

     im not another joe hawkins bnt
   like your mag a lot im  and have a
   question to ask dont think i want to
   tell you how to run your mag but
   couldnt you kill off your villains once
   in a while it would please me pink if
   you would it gets uninteresting when
   you almost know that when you finish
   an adventure the villain will be back
   please kill him so surely that you could
   take him home and stuff him

     i am a lone agent and lack jast one
   person to form a chapter

     it would please me very much if you
   would get that jap matzu

      yours till nippy and bull get a ger-
   man accent

                       charles paterson

   charles im sure that bob hogan
 would like nothing better than to kill off
 all of those villains both in the last war
 and in this one too but we get other
 letters that beg us to continue with herr
 doktor krueger and stahlmaske and the
 others and remember this once we
 have definitely killed off a villain you
 cant bring him back even stuffed vve
 did think in the old days that he had them
 done for when we left a job
