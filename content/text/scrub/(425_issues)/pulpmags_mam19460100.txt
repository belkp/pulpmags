 mean achievement
 readers sent in

  who have been upsetting
  of periodicals at the
  search for the second issue
     here it is i and were
  better than the first-no
  from the letters you
   number 

 eor a time it appeared this issue was going to
  be truly mammoth- pages later it ap-
 peared there would be no magazine at all we
 wont bore you with details beyond saying that the
 work of an editor is not always the idyllic pastime
 its reported to be-and usually is

 dhyllis dayton makes her debut with a rib-
  tickling story of two ex-g is who decide to
 show the big city just how crime should be con-
 trolled they probably could have done it too if
 they hadnt needed all their skill to keep from
 being classified as criminals themselves

 nce in a while just to keep from getting into
 a rut a real horror yarn shows up in our pages
 usually there is a pile of corn in that type of
 story but youll discover there is nothing stero-
 typed in death on location and when you
 meet the half-man half-alligator in corrells offer-
 ing there will be enough chills around to drive
 you under the blankets

dut lets get cown to what youre getting this
time for your two-bits leading off and
taking up most of the pages is bruno fischers
 word novel the spider lily fischer one
of the most prolific and widely read detective
story writers of the day has pulled out all the stops
in this one putting together a yarn that is not
only fast-moving and exciting but based on a
theme as timely as tomorrows headlines what
happens when a returned war hero murders his
faithless wife will the jury base its findings on
the evidence or on its emotions what will be the
effect on the mails family and friends    the
novel is scheduled for book publication next year
but it is offered to you in these pages complete
and unabridged

the name larry holden may be as new to you
as it was to us but youll discover he can put
a story together that will have you on the edge
of your chair for the best type of whodunit he
says you start with a corpse and thats exactly
where this one begins holden writes in a hard
fast crisp style and he has a feel for colorful
language and characters that makes the story sing
theres a grand plot here too we have other
stories by holden in thfiles all featuring keogh
the private eye and youll get them from time to
time

eor this months off-the-trail talc dont pass up
r close to my heart by chester s geier this
one will show you what happens when a man lets
jealousy turn love into hate then holds that hatred
close to his heart the twist at the end will hit you
like a fist i

a round the time you come across this issue
of mammoth mystery youll find another
of our publications on the stands it is mammoth
detective and it contains stories equally as good
as those in these pages in addition that issue
january was put together under difficulties that
tested all the ingenuity we could muster pick up
a copy not only for the stories but because its
unusual format makes it truly a collectors item
a few moments spent in leafing through it will
show you what we mean

lvf ammoth mystery is now on a regular bi-
 monthly schedule and it may not be very
long before you can have it every month even-
tually the number of pages will be almost double
the present count just when that will take place
will depend on the printers ability to handle the
extra work involved

t ooking ahead once in a great while an
amateur at the writing business will pull up
a typewriter and knock out a story that not only
rings the bell but tears off the dapper our next
issue will feature such a story-a novel written
by a man who never wrote before in a way we
discovered him him first and weve been feeling
good about it ever since his name is roy hug-
gins a californian and to give you an idea of
what he has on the ball the same novel will appear
in book form early next year we are told
that william morrow  company the publisher
is more excited about hugginss work than that
of any other author theyve brought out in the
past ten years we must hold back the story
title but we do ask you to remember that the
authors name is roy huggins	-h b

mammoth mystery

she wasnt there i paused on the
lowest step and looked past the
two women running toward me
lily wasnt anywhere on the narrow
station platform

  getting off lieutenant the con-
ductor said

  i stepped down to the platform my
sister ursula flung her arms about me
and held me to her cushiony bosom and
said my name over and over as if to
taste the sound of it

  miriam watched me with a tremulous
smile her black hair was gathered
back in a tight bun showing her high
forehead to the hairline the summer
sun had given an oriental burnish to
her normally dark skin making a
charming contrast with the egg-shell
white of her thin nicely filled sweater

  wheres lily i asked ursula

  she couldnt come ursulas fin-
gers ran over the ribbons on my chest
you didnt write us about all those
medals

  why couldnt lily come i said
ursula stepped back il explain
later arent you going to say hello
to miriam

  i held out a hand to miriam she
didnt seem to notice it she leaned
against me and tilted her face and i
brushed her mouth with mine her
hands touched my arms and fell away
quickly when i turned back to ursula

  is that the way to kiss miriam after
two years alec ursula boomed

  she was a big woman large-boned
rather than fleshy handsome rather
than pretty she was feminine enough
for most mens taste except when she
was bossy and then she assumed the
voice and manner of a back-slapping
male id never liked that in her and
it jarred me now particularly

  has anything happened to lily i
persisted

  there was a silence overlapped by

the roar of the departing train ursula
and miriam exchanged a glance then
ursula said shes not home today
and tucked a hand through my arm
how about showing some interest in
miriam and me

  why hasnt lily come to the sta-
tion i said w i phoned yesterday
from new york that id be on this
train

  ursulas mouth made a crooked di-
agonal line the way it did when she was
annoyed she didnt have a chance to
say whatever she intended to because
just then oliver spencer came around
the corner of the station house he
hurried toward me with outstretched
hand

  he was a little man with a habitual
stoop and a fringe of gray hair forming
a halo about his bald pate he owned
the largest food market in west am-
ber and he had a daughter with whom
i used to neck and a son with whom id
gone to high school

  well well he said pumping my
hand ive heard you were coming
home from india are ou better

  i wasnt wounded i picked up my
bag

  i know i heard you were very
sick some kind of mental-

  ursula said quickly doesnt he
look fine oliver so ruddy and clear-
eyed

  oh mr spencer glanced at his
watch you look fit all right alec
ive got to see about a shipment of eggs
which came by express he shook my
hand again and bustled off

j walked between ursula and mir-
iam down the length of the platform
none of us seemed to have any words
this wasnt at all the way i had ex-
pected it

  when we reached the car ursula
paused with her hand on the doorhandle
the spider lily



and looked back i should have told
oliver that im calling off tonights
game unless youd like to take a hand
at poker alec

  i expect to spend the evening with
lily so go ahead and play i said

  ursula slid behind the wheel without
comment we sat three in the front
seat i in the middle the sedan still
had its luster inside and out but it had
trouble climbing the hill from the sta-
tion to the town 

  i leaned forward listening to the
motor it needs a tune-up ill work
on it tomorrow

  the car missed you almost as much
as we did ursula said

  that was all id been gone twenty-
two months i had come home from
the other side of the world and conver-
sation lagged after a couple of sentences
about the car i felt miriams thigh
against my right thigh and ursulas
shoulder against my left shoulder but
we werent together at all

  we drove through the business sec-
tion of west amber it was exactly
the way i had left it the sun baking the
road and men in shirtsleeves lounging
in the shade of storefronts and women
in slacks wheeling baby carriages and
children playing box games on the side-
walk and cars searching for parking
space along the curb month after
month lying in a sticky bunk under
netting or flying six miles above earth
or brooding at the tailend of drinking
too much you saw this scene in your
mind and your insides contracted at the
thought of coming home to it or of never
coming home to it or toanything and
sometimes you were sure that you
would weep like a woman when you saw
it again

   here i was and it wasnt like that it
wasnt anything but a familiar scene

  look i said angrily when i
was grounded i wrote you that there

was nothing much wrong with me
physically or mentally

  of course ursula said

  then what was mr spencer talking
about he seemed to expect me to get
off the train cutting paper dolls

  i suppose he heard- she had
trouble getting the rest of it out

  that i was psychoneurotic i
said so what in the air forces
that term covers almost anything in
my case it merely meant that the flight
surgeon decided that i shouldnt fly
combat any more most men cant fly
combat to begin with im at least as
normal as they are

  of course

  then damn it dont try to shield
me from myself or from anybody else

t trsula took her eyes from the
road but not long enough for me
to look into them what gives you the
idea that anybody is trying to shield
you from anything

  you do i can take it go ahead
and tell me that my wife walked out on
me

  she didnt miriam said her voice
a little breathless

  then why wasnt lily at the station
to meet me

  alec stop screaming ursula said
quietly

  i hadnt realized that i was i sank
back between the shoulders of the two
women and found that i was panting

  all right i screamed i said i
suppose that proves that im a mental
case

  nobody thinks you are ursula
said dont be so sensitive

  im sorry i said theres no
reason why i should be sensitive none
at all ive been away for a couple of
years in a place i hated doing what no
man should be made to do all that
sustained a lot of us was the thought of


mammoth mystery

getting home home to our wives
those who had them now im home
and my wife-

  alec listen miriam touched my
arm lily-

  she happens to be visiting relatives
in new york ursula cut in tartly
thats why she wasnt at the station
then why didnt you let me know
when i phoned you from new york i
could have met her there

  because we wanted to see you
ursula said lily would have kept
you away from us for days youll
have time enough for her

  that was all it was-jealousy while
i was away theyd been kind enough
to lily whom id brought home to live
with them otherwise lily would have
let me know in her far-between carp-
ing letters but now that i was back
they resented another womans having
predominant claim to me females
must own a man and both of them had
owned me they were on the defensive
because they had played a shabby trick
on me

  i said ursula please drive me back
to the station

  the car slowed down but not
enough cant you wait at least a
day to rush into her arms ursula
said grimly

 shes my wife	w

  and miriam and i are nothing to
you

  you know thats not true only-
i couldnt bring myself to put it into
words for them i had a right to
lilys body and it was a beautiful body
perhaps i hated her i hardly knew
her there had been the letters but
before that there had been the three
nights with her i had come home
for more of those nights i had to have
them

  i havent any idea where she is stay-
ing in new york ursula was saying

youll have to wait till she comes back
or phones

  what was there to say they had
me blocked off the car was laboring
up mandolin hill road

  here we are ursula sang out ab-
ruptly cheerful

jphe car swung into the semi-circu-
lar driveway and pulled up in front
of the porch the two-story frame
house painted ivory and trimmed royal
blue glistened in the sinking sunlight
the hedge needed cutting and the lawn
was too high-another chore to keep
me busy until lily returned if she
did return

  i reached into the back seat of the
sedan for my bag and went up the
porch steps with miriam ursula had
gone ahead to unlock the door there
was a solemn and remote set to miri-
ams angular face as she moved at my
side and no words for me

  whats wrong i said have
you been reading those sappy articles
for civilians which tell you to treat re-
turned veterans as i they hadnt been
away neither of you asked me a
thing about myself

  miriam stopped on the top porch
step it takes time for us to get used
to you alec youre so different so
much older especially your eyes
im psychoneurodc i said a
mental case it shows through my
eyes

  please alec miriam took my
hand her palm was hot and moist
stop twisting everything we say stop
feeling sorry for yourself

  thats another symptom feeling
sorry for yourself

  she yanked her hand away and strode
angrily to the door then she turned
suddenly contrite alec remember
this ursula and i love you more than
anybody else does
the spider lily



  meaning more than lily i said
what about her

  ursula was in the hall looking out
at us its after seven alec and din-
ner is practically ready youll want
to wash up first

  miriam stepped into the hall and
continued on to the kitchen she hadnt
answered my question

  my room was waiting for me when
i closed the door behind me the sense
of being home came in a rush these
were the things i knew best the walnut
bed and dresser the bookcases
crammed with volumes on poker and
chess and cryptography and mathemat-
ics the stand containing thirty worn
volumes of the encyclopedia brittanica
the portable typewriter in its case
the tiny radio on the desk the chess
trophies on the corner shelf and the
hand-carved ivory chessmen the rifle
and barbells on the wall and the two
hogarth prints

  i dropped my vidise and took down
my  repeating rifle from its pegs it
had been cleaned and oiled within the
last week probably by ursula who
knew something about guns and wasnt
a bad shot i replaced the rifle and
opened the closet door my civilian
suits hung there cleaned and pressed
in the dresser i found shirts socks un-
derwear all freshly laundered

  it was all there for me to take up
where i had left off

  i shed my uniform and left it on the
floor and got into the checker rayon
bathrobe and went into the bathroom
for a shower i returned and dressed
in light gray slacks and aavy blue shirt
and powder blue knitted necktie and
dark gray tweed jacket then i walked
back and forth across the room look-
ing at myself in the dresser mirror every
time i passed it little by little i got
used to myself

  the clothes helped most home to

clothes which were not like everybodys
home to my own room home to ur-
sula and miriam they were swell
women and lily wasnt worth any part
of them but lily was the woman i had
come home to be with

chapter ii
yesterday and today

phe dinette was separated from the
living room by an arch and a step
when i raised my eyes from the table
i looked directly at the large framed
photo of august hennessey above the
redbrick fireplace he had been a
blonde giant half-irish half-swede
enough man for a woman like ursula
in the photo he wore a grin as wide as
his broad amiable face and a yellow
curl hung rakishly over his left eye he
could have passed-ior a romantic adven-
turer out of the more lurid pages of
fiction actually he had been a sales-
man of glassware

  ursula married him when she was
eighteen i was three at the time our
mother had had her two children fifteen
years apart ursula had been visiting
an aunt in new york city and one day
she led that huge man into the house
by the hand and announced that they
were on the way to mexico for their
honeymoon

  they visited us about once a year
but the first definite impression i have
of august hennessey was his excite-
ment when i beat him at chess i was
seven and he promised me that during
his next visit he would teach me the fine
points of poker that was his game he
said-something like chess in that you
must anticipate your opponent

  but when august hennessey and ur-
sula came next year it was to attend
mas funeral so there were no games
chess or cards they wanted to take


mammoth mystery

me back to live with them in the home
they had built in the upstate new york
town of west amber but pa refused to
let me go he was a meek taciturn
trolley car conductor whom id never
got close to not even when i had be-
come old enough to share his passion for
chess but now he needed me in his lone-
liness

  i never saw august hennessey again
while on a selling trip to buffalo his
car crashed into a truck and he was
killed

  he left ursula the house clear of
mortgage and like most salesmen a
substantial insurance policy i dont
know how much it was but enough for
her to live in comfort and later support
miriam and me for years there was a
rumor in west amber that had quite
an income from her saturday night
poker games but of course there was
no kitty for the house though she was
very good the men who played with
her were no slouches and i doubt if she
won much more than she lost

  ursula wasnt one to brood in an
empty house she could have married
again she had money and was young
and attractive for a big woman what
she did was to pick out miriam from
an orphanage and adopt her as the
daughter she had not had with august
hennessey

  i was ten when pa died of pneu-
monia ursula drove all night from
west amber to cleveland miriam was
with her-a skinny black-eyed girl of
eight who terrified me by throwing her
toothpick arms around my neck and
kissing me and calling me her big
brother i pointed out to her that if
anything she was my niece by adop-
tion but that actually she was nothing
at all to me i also told her that i dis-
liked girls especially being kissed by
them which was true at the time but
not for long

  ursula buried pa and packed my
things and the three of us drove east
when the car climbed mandolin hill
and i saw the ivory-and-blue frame
house i felt that  was coming home
although i had never been there before
and in a few days it was home and had
been until four years ago when i had
enlisted in the air force

    ow i was back eating as i had so
many hundreds of times in the
pine-panelled dinette with ursula and
miriam but this was no longer all of
my family i had a wife who should be
here or with whom i should be

  abruptly i put down my knife and
fork

  lily knew within a few days when
id get in i said shed hang around
waiting for me or if she went away on
a visit shed leave word where i could
find her

  ursula reached lor my plate to fill it
with a second helping of roast lamb and
apricots which nobody in the world
could cook the way she did im not
responsible for your wife alec well
discuss her after dinner

  so there is something to discuss
i said

  she dipped her head to slice the meat
miriam ignored the food on her plate
to watch her intently then ursula
handed my plate to me and said to mi-
riam what have we ever done to him
to make him snap a every word we say
does he think we murdered his precious
wife and buried her in the cellar she
turned an angry face to me theres a
great deal to discuss youll have to
start planning for your future

  it was an old trick of hers to turn my
words back at me and making them
mean something altogether different i
never said you havent been swell to lily
and me youve supported me for all
those years and-
the spider lily



  pa left his insurance to you

  you saved it to see me through col-
lege then i brought my wife home
whom youd never seen before and you
kept her here with you for two-
youve been supporting her through
your allotments ursula said i made
sure that she contributed to household
expenses do you know that kerry nu-
gent is back

  i finished the mashed potatoes in my
mouth before answering he left later
than i did but he flew while i came by
ship where is he stationed

  hes home on sick leave miriam
told me hes been here several times
and he looks fine when you called yes-
terday that youd be home tonight i
tried to get in touch with him to tell
him but his mother said hed gone to
new york

  new york i muttered lily was in
new york kerry had met lily at the
same party i had and hed tried his
best to make her what the hell was the
matter with me kerry wouldnt pull
anything like that if he had had any-
thing to do with lily since his return
it would be to slap her ears off for the
way she had treated me sure that
would be kerry

  he told us all about that last flight
you two were on miriam was saying

  the food turned to straw in my
mouth did he tell you how i smashed
his ribs and killed ezra bilkin

  they stared at me

  what are you talking about ur-
sula said who is ezra bilkin

  he was our flight engineer he died
because i lost my necve and lost my
way home

  alec thats not what kerry said -
miriam leaned against the table her
grave black eyes filling her face kerry
was pilot he ought to know he said
that after your radio was shot out no
other navigator could have got the plane

back to land he said that if anybody
else had been navigator everybody in
the plane would have been killed

   ezra bilkin was a swell guy i said
he had a wife and two kids in indiana
it was my job to bring the ship home
safely and i muffed it

  but youd brought it back so many
times before miriam argued kerry
said you and he flew twenty-three com-
bat missions before-

   before i lost my nerve i said be-
fore flak shook us like a cork in a storm
and a zero planted a bullet an inch from
my ear suppose the radio was gone
a schoolboy can take a b- home on
a beam i went to pieces why do you
think they grounded me

t trsula reached across the table and
firmly gripped my hand theres
no need to shout alec

  so i was shouting again i was shak-
ing all over and the food i had eaten
was bouncing in my stomach i jerked
my wrist away from ursula and
clutched the edge of the table with both
hands id never before had it as bad
as this major goldfarb the chief flight
surgeon told me id be fine if i avoided
undue excitement for a while and that
even if i got these attacks they were
nothing to worry about but ursula
and miriam looked at me as if watching
my dying convulsions

  i shout i said bitterly so im a
mental case

  nobody ever said- miriam started
to protest and then gave it up

  i pushed back my chair and stood up
and went through the swinging door in-
to the kitchen then miriam called
alec please come back and finish eat-
ing

  let him go ursula spoke in a
half-whisper but i heard it in the
kitchen the trip upset him hell be
better after a rest


mammoth mystery

   trip nothing miriam said its
 lily ursula arent you going to-

   later ursula said after he calms
 down

   their voices dropped still lower and
 i couldnt distinguish words i crossed
 the kitchen to the door at the other
 end and went up the hall the doorbell
 rang before i reached the foot of the
 stairs i opened the front door and
 three men entered two of them i knew
 -oliver spencer who had been at the
 station when i arrived and george
 winkler

   years ago miriam and i decided that
 george winkler would marry ursula
 the moment she wanted him he was
 a bear of a man big and shaggy with
 small bright eyes that crinkled readily
 and a broad nose that wrinkled when
 he was amused he was the most promi-
 nent lawyer in west amber which
 sounded more imposing than it was
 for a long time now his romance with
 ursula had trickled on placidly with-
 out change or interruption if it was
 a romance perhaps miriam and i were
 all wrong and he had dinner at our
 house once a week and was the main-
 stay of ursulas saturday night poker
 games only because an aging bachelor
 needed an anchor somewhere

   he greeted me as a father might
 pounding my upper arms with his large
 open hands

   i see you were in a hurry to get
 back into civilian clothes oliver spen-
 cer observed how do you feel in
 them

   fine

   thats the way it was when i came
 jiome from the last war george wink-
 ler said i couldnt wait to dress in
 something with color in it do you
 know owen dowie alec i guess not
 he comes from the other end of the
 county and was elected sheriff only last
 year

rjhe third man stepped forward to
shake my hand blame western
stories for the assumption that a sher-
iff is a gaunt gimlet-eye man with a
gun swinging from his hip sheriff
owen dowie looked like a mild and
somewhat scared bookkeeper he had
a pinched rather intense face and pale
myopic eyes psering through thick
shell-rimmed glasses

  heard a lot about you linn he
said im told you can make the cards
stand on end and call you brother
mr spencer chuckled ill lay you
ten to one alec can deal you any hand
you ask for and youll never guess how
he did it

  im out of practice i said
whats the matter didnt you find
suckers in the air force  dowie asked
with a shadowy smile

  there was a silence then george
handed dowie a glare alec never
played a crooked hand in his life ex-
cept to show how it was done

  i was only kidding dowie said
hastily i mean a player like you
shouldve had a good thing with all the
poker played in the army one man i
know came back from italy with five
thousand dollars in winnings

  i hardly played i said

  mr spencer patted his bald head
well ive been able to take you over
now and then alec and im looking
forward to bucking you again tonight
im sorry but im not playing to-
night i said

  ursula came into the hall and apol-
ogized for having finished dinner so
late would they wait downstairs in
the cardroom until she and miriam
cleaned up the three men went down
the hall to the basement door under the
staircase and for the first time since
my return i was alone with ursula
all right lets discuss i said
almost she seemed to squirm
the spider lily



theres no rush and i cant keep my
guests waiting why not take a hand in
the game it will take your mind off-
she stopped

  off lily i said no thanks

t went outside it was not quite

  dark yet and the moon was a
squeezed lemon low in the sky above
the lights of west amber i crossed the
front of the house and walked up one
of the gravel paths through the flower-
beds

  it was the middle of july now but
it had been as mild as this on those two
early may nights when lily and i had
walked here wed had our arms about
each other and now and then we stopped
to kiss we walked all the way to the
rickety bench where the grape arbor
used to be before it fell apart and we
sat there and necked like two high
school kids

  the lily i called her she was like
one tall and slender and all of her so
very white even her hair which was
platinum and that night even her skirt
and blouse were white the smell of
her hair was in my nostrils and my
mouth tasted of the perfume that was
in her lipstick her face was small
elfin and lovelier in moonlight than i
had ever seen it and it was always
turned up to me

  that was what i had wanted to come
home to not the lily who wrote bored
and often nasty letters when she both-
ered to write at all but the white lily of
that night my ardent wife with the
elfin face and the sweet eager body

  we had necked on the bench like two
adolescents and then had gone up to
our room that was our last night to-
gether there had been two other
nights-the first in a new york hotel
after we were married and the second
here in my room

  walking alone in the garden now i

had almost reached the bench i
stopped dead and turned to look at the
house that side of it was dark except
for light in the kitchen and in the base-
ment cardroom there were three bed-
rooms upstairs-ursulas and miriams
and mine lily of course had been
given my room when i left it had been
our room for two days and nights

  i found myself running back to the
house a minute or two would make
no difference but i ran and i was
breathing hard when i burst into my
room

  my room a mans room obviously
not a room in which a woman lived

  i hadnt guessed earlier that evening
when i had changed my clothes be-
cause for so many years it had been
exclusively my room shared with no-
body it hadnt occurred to me that it
should have been different that in
twenty-two months it should have
ceased to be a mans room and should
have become a womans room

                  n

  i tore open the closet door no dress
no skirt nothing that was a womans
no cosmetics and brushes and combs
on the dresser and no womens stock-
ing and undergarments in the dresser

  lily didnt live in this room she
didnt live anywhere in this house they
had lied to me ursula was afraid to
tell me the truth whatever it was

chapter iii

blood on the lily

rjhere were subdued voices
in the living room i went in there
instead of down to the basement on
the couch in front of the dead fireplace
bevis spencer was holding miriams
hand he turned his head sharply when
he heard me and dropped her hand in
confusion and clambered up to his feet

  its swell to see you back he said


mammoth mystery

grabbing my hand between his two
palms

  my throat made polite noises of
greeting

  bevis was oliver spencers son but
in no way like his small bald go-getter
father he was a head taller and had a
thick unruly mop of hair which would
last forever and he was awkward and
embarrassed with strangers he had
opened up only a little since our high
school days when hed been a moody
unsmiling boy who kept more or less
to himself the only reason i had come
to know him fairly well was that in
those days i had a crush on his sister
helen and spent considerable time in
the spencer house

  i begged the army doctors to pass
me bevis was saying but they re-
fused ill always feel i missed some-
thing big

  you missed something all right i
told him youll never know how lucky
you were do you mind if i speak to
miriam alone

  she had been pushing back her hair
from her brow and readjusting her bun
when i said that her hands paused at
the sides of her head but she didnt look
up at me

  bevis glowered at me glowering
came easy to those deep-set eyes under
overhanging brows i was on my way
downstairs anyway he said without
enthusiasm they have only four
hands and i promised to make a fifth

  i waited until he was out in the hall
before i turned to miriam she spoke
first

  bevis wants to marry me alec

  that was why he had glowered at
me id be sore too if somebody had
barged in at a time like that i told her
that i was sorry that id come in at the
wrong moment

  it doesnt matter he said bevis
has been proposing to me sbout once

a month during the last year id just
put him off again

  hes too gloomy for you

  he brightens up a lot when you
know him well hes intelligent and
considerate and sweet

  so whats wrong

  miriam didnt answer she stood up
and went to the table and took a ciga-
rette out of the translucent plastic ciga-
rette-box i noticed lor the first time
since my return that shed put on
weight just about enough weight she
had been too skinny since childhood and
now her figure was pleasantly mature
and her angular face no longer had that
pinched look she was a very attractive
girl not beautiful like lily or helen
spencer and perhaps not even pretty if
you took her features apart but the
black-eyed dark-skinned animation of
her face made up for it

  i dont know what to do alec she
said after a pause

tt was my duty to be the sympa-
thetic confidant and advisor and dis-
cuss her problem with her far into the
night i was the man oi the household
the nearest thing to a father or brother
she had but i had a problem of my
own which was a lot more urgent than
hers to me anyway

  wheres lily i demanded

  she took the unlighted cigarette from
her mouth ursula told you

  cut it out i realized i had shouted
that and lowered my voice lily isnt
living in this house

  she put a match to her cigarette she
had trouble getting a light then she
said no she isnt

  whats happened to her

  dont get frightened shes in the
best of health as far as i know

  i gripped her arm she uttered a little
exclamation and i loosened my fingers
she walked out on me didnt she
the spider lily



  no alec she didnt she-ur-
sula- she drew in smoke and made a
fresh start ursula asked her to leave
the house

  why

  youd better ask ursula

  when did this happen

  two weeks ago

  panting i stepped back it wasnt
lilys fault that she hadnt met me at
the station that was good to know
wheres lily now

  shes living somewhere right here
in town

  so lily hadnt walked out on me as
for almost a year now i had thought
she might she could have moved back
to the bright lights and gayety of new
york when ursula had kicked her out
instead she had remained in this dull
town where i would be able to find her
at once

  i struggled to keep my voice under
control you mean to say that you
didnt let lily know that i was coming
home today

  ursula wanted to have a talk with
you before you sew lily

  about why she threw lily out of the
house why did she

  miriam brought the cigarette up to
her mouth it trembled against her lips
and she tossed it into the fireplace she
was nearly as upset as i was ursula
will tell you

  why didnt she tell me before this
she wanted to break it gently
because she thinks im a mental
case and wants to cushion the shock

tvririam put a hand on my chest

      her dark intense eyes were misty
please alec try to understand how we
feel ursula is anxious that you hear
our side first she planned to have a
long talk with you after dinner but then
the men arrived for the poker game
so poker is more important than i

am is that it

  alec thats not fair

  all right i conceded so she
found excuses to put it off because she
was afraid to tell me she thinks im
not in a fit mental state to take bad
news it must be pretty bad if ursula
kicked her out of the house it was
because of a man wasnt it

  she reached for another cigarette
although she hadnt taken more than a
couple of puffs on the one shed dis-
carded ursula will tell you all about
it

  she had her chance whats lilys
address

  alec please have a talk with ursula
first

  where is lily staying i yelled
ursula asked me not to say anything
until she-

  i swung away from her and went
out to the hall and ran down the base-
ment stairs

  the cardroom took up half the cel-
lar and was more cozily furnished than
any other room in the house it had an
oak floor and a beamed ceiling and was
panelled in cedar there was a tiny
bar in one corner and a radio and a
couple of leather lounge chairs in an-
other and at the far end of the room
a bridge table which was seldom used
the round poker table big enough to
seat ten players dominated the room
the red leather chairs were custom-
built for a persons bones and the neon
lights were as soft as a summer dawn

  sheriff owen dowie was dealing
when i burst in they were playing
stud and dowies arm paused in midair
as he was about to slide bevis spencers
fourth card across the table there
must have been something in my face
that made dowie and ursula and
george winkler facing the door stare
at me oliver spencer and bevis spen-
cer turned in their chairs and added


mammoth mystery

their stares to the others

  i said ursula where is lily stay-
ing

  she started to rise from her chair i
told you-

  you lied i said shes in town
ursula rose all the way and flashed
an angry look over my shoulder mi-
riam had followed me down the stairs
and stood behind me just inside the
doorway ursula turned back to the
table im sorry gentlemen but youll
have to excuse me for a few minutes
i dont want to break up the game
i said i only want to know where to
find my wife

  ursula came around the chair and
took my arm lets go upstairs alec
she said in the gentle tone one uses to a
sick child

  like hell i said all i want to
hear from you is lilys address

  alec if youll listen-

  i shook her off and went up to the
table some of you men must know
where lily is bevis you can tell me

devis dropped his eyes to his cards

    he had a seven and a queen show-
ing and the card which dowie still held
in his hand would be his second queen
dowie was peering curiously at me
through the thick lenses of his glasses
george winkler fumbled with a cigar
wrapper oliver spencer brushed back
non-existent hair on his head

  youre all in on this i said i
was shouting id been shouting since
i entered the room i didnt care id
keep on shouting dont think im a
dope ive an idea what lily was up to
while i was away it was between the
lines of everything she wrote me but
now im back and by god-

  my voice choked off in my throat
this wasnt any of their business it
was too personal to invite anybody in
on my agony

  there was a brittle silence while i
pulled out my handkerchief to wipe my
sweating face then george winkler
sighed as loudly as a gust of wind
sweeping through the room

alec shes not worth it he said
none of your damn business i
flung at him i iont need any of you
to tell me how to handle my wife
where is she

  ursula was back at my side clawing
at my arm alec control yourself
if youll come upstairs with me for just
five minutes-

  why should i control myself
wheres my wife

  suddenly she looked very tired her
broad shoulders drooped have it your
way shes staying in a bungalow on
james street

  thanks i said bitterly and turned
to the door miriam was still standing
there she stepped out of the way and i
brushed past her and raced out of the
house

  a coupe was swinging into the drive-
way when i reached the road some-
body called my name and the car stop-
ped broadside to me by the dash light
i saw kerry nugent behind the wheel
and helen spencer beside him

  theyd come to visit me of course
kerry would ask me how i was and i
would ask him how he was and hed tell
me the latest news about airmen we
knew all over the world and whom you
were always running into or hearing
about and how soon he expected to re-
turn to active duty i did not want any
talk at all tonight except with lily and
not too much talk with her

  i said ill see you tomorrow
kerry and moved past the coupe and
out to the road

  alec

  i glanced back kerry had the door
open and one foot out i put my head
down and walked as rapidly as i could
the spider lily



without quite running fleeing from the
conspiracy to keep me from my wifes
arms

     the bottom of the hill i paused

     james street was two miles away
yet id run right past ursulas car which
was still parked in the driveway i
was a guy in such a terrific hurry that
i was taking ten times as long walking
as it would to drive i hadnt even had
sense to bring along a flashlight

  it would still save time to go back for
the car but some of them might be out-
side the house and i couldnt face them
again not now anyway i walked
on and came to the fifteenth tee of the
golf course where it angled toward the
road as kids we used to take a short
cut diagonally across the course to the
second hole saving perhaps half a mile
i climbed the stone boundary wall and
by the sickly light of the waning moon
started across the fairway

  george winkler had said that lily
wasnt good enough for me or not worth
it or something like that whatever it
was he had put into indefinite language
the vaguer fears caused by her letters
or not hearing at all from her for weeks
did george know or had he handed me
town gossip and would ursula have
kicked her out without certain knowl-
edge

  face it two years ago she was your
wife for three days and nights and after
that you were strangers who didnt
again see each other while you yearned
in loneliness and faithfulness at the
other end of the world she did not keep
her bed always empty what were you
going to do about it

  nothing

  nothing tonight and perhaps noth-
ing tomorrow or the day after that i
wanted her i hated her and wanted
her as i had hated her and wanted her
for a long time now submerging dread

and fear in the memory of those three
nights and the never-ending hunger for
her

   id use the lilys beautiful body id
satisfy my need for her and after
that-

  i didnt know i didnt want to know
tonight

  at the second hole i came out on old
mill road at the edge of town my
watch said seven minutes to ten too
early for her to be asleep i would
like that finding her in bed and waking
her with kisses

  but suppose she didnt want you
suppose her body had no more ardor
for you than her letters had had

  by god id take her anyway
brutally id hurt her id-

  i stopped to catch my breath i
hadnt been walking rapidly since i had
reached the bottom of the hill but all
the same i was drawing air into my
lungs with labored gasps i fumbled
out a cigarette lighted it and the smoke
felt good inside me i walked along the
clearly defined macadam road

t ames street it wasnt actually
j a street there werent any in west
amber except for the three which com-
prised the business section it was a
tar road along either side houses were
spotted at varying intervals there
was a mile of it and like a sap id left
the cardroom without asking just where
on james street lily lived

  a car approached i stood in the mid-
dle of the road and waved in the hope
that whoever was in the car could tell
me where to find her the headlights
bore down on me the car did not
slacken speed it seemed determined to
run me down i jumped and felt the
wind of its passing

  i cursed the driver for a madman
glad to be able to curse something and
went on the mailboxes stood on the


mammoth mystery

right side of the road one of them
should bear her name i struck matches
to read the boxes passing up those in
front of houses in which i knew she
could not be because they were too large
or i knew the people who lived in them

  like george winklers white brick
house when i passed it light went on
in an upstairs room that would be
amy winkler georges spinster sister
who kept house for him she knew
everything there was to know in town
she would tell me but she would also
gush over me in greeting i kept walk-
ing

  two boxes farther on i came to it
the name josephs was crossed out
with black crayon and under it was
waveringly printed lily linn

 linn my name the name i had
given to my wife

  it was suddenly very good to be
home the fact remained that she had
stayed on here in west amber to wait
for my return that was all that
counted the rest was merely an inabil-
ity to write letters as passionate as her
embraces she was waiting for me and
i was coming to her

  it was a neat little stucco bungalow
just off the road every window was
lighted with both hands i brushed
back my wild hair and ran my handker-
chief over my face and went up to the
door i flicked my tongue over my dry
lips and knocked

  there was no sound in the house
she wouldnt have gone out and left all
the lights on perhaps she had dropped
off to sleep while reading the door
was unlocked i pushed it in

  the door opened directly into a small
living room i saw her at once she
was lying on the floor at the side of a
reed couch

  i closed the door behind me and
walked slowly into the room not think-
ing not feeling anything except some-

thing jumping in the emptiness inside of
me

  she was on her side turned away
from me her knees bent i squatted
beside her and pul a hand on her
shoulder

  then i saw the knife in her breast
i reached ovetwher shoulder and grab-
bed the handle and started to pull the
knife out it came out easily it came
halfway out and suddenly i jerked my
hand away from the knife as if it had
turned glowing hot

  the truth hit me like a kick in the
stomach the lily was dead nobody
lives with a knife in bis heart

  i straightened up leside her and at
once my knees started to bend i sank
down on the couch the room wavered
i put my head in my hands closing my
eyes tight against the darkness of my
palms

jt was very still- somewhere a
clock ticked i dared take my
hands from my face and the room had
straightened out my head remained
bent i was looking down at her legs

  one foot was covered by a satin mule
the other foot was bare and the mule
which belonged to it lay behind her
she wore no stockings and the nails of
her toes were scarlet the first time i
had ever seen her without any clothes
on i had oddly noticed first of all her
painted toenails they had shocked me
a little and excited me

  she was wearing the heavy silk hos-
tess gown with the tawny-orange tiger
lilies i had bought it for her the day
we were married lilies for lily i had
said a poor joke perhaps but the
kind you delight in on honeymoons
during all the breakfasts id had with
her the first in the new york hotel
room and the other two at home she
had worn it the hem had hiked up on
her body and her uppermost thigh was
the spider lily



naked it was a lovely thigh smooth
and rounded and even now i could re-
member the firm warm feel of it

   sitting bent over that was all i could
see of her i didnt want to see any
more but i had to i raised my head
an inch and let my eyes move up the
crumpled form

  the knife protruded from the swell
of her left breast the dull black han-
dle of a kitchen knife there was a
tiger lily on each breast and i remem-
bered telling her one morning that those
two and one other were my favorite
lilies of all the many on the hostess
gown the knife had pierced the one
over her left breast and it was no longer
tawny-orange her life had dyed it red

   my eyes remained on the bloody lily
not wanting to look higher a body is
a body living or dead but a face-

  i looked her face was no longer
beautiful no longer elfin-no longer
anything but dead

   then the shakes got me as badly as
that first time when wed jumped from
our gasless plane and i was bending
over kerry nugent who was tangled
in his parachute joe klintcamp the
copilot had slapped me and that had
helped there was nobody to slap me
now i dropped my head and shook
and felt sweat cover me

  it didnt last long it was passing
when i heard the door open i looked
up and sheriff oven dowie stood in the
doorway peering myopically at lily

  he didnt say anything at first he
closed the door and came forward and
knelt beside her then he shifted his
gaze up to me his pitched face was
sad

   im sorry about this linn he said

   i hadnt heard the sheriffs car but
i heard the second car pull up we both
turned our heads listening to a car door
slam then there was a knock and a
man said alec

  dowie looked at me to see what i
would do about it i just sat there
the knock came again lily
dowie said quietly come in

  it was kerry nugent he gawked at
dowie in surprise and took a step or two
into the room before he saw her alec
he said weakly he came on to dowies
side is she dead

  he stuck a knife in her heart
dowie said

 he whom did dowie mean i
heard the clock why were they so
very quiet

  you dont think- i said their
faces told me what they thought my
god i didnt kill her

  kerry turned his eyes away from me
  im sorry linn dowie said again

chapter iv
the jail

ttrsula stopped inside the
cell and sent a startled shocked
glance over her shoulder at the door
closing behind her then she kissed
me quickly on the mouth and thrust a
package into my hands like an embar-
rassed little girl presenting a gift at a
birthday party one of your chess
sets she said

  thanks i tossed the package on
the cot and led her to the wooden chair
sit on that its softer than the cot
her big frame perched unrelaxed on
the edge of the chair she looked about
a second was enough to take in every-
thing there was to be seen she shud-
dered how horrible for you

  a bit cramped i conceded but
the food is wholesome and the turnkey
does little favors for me-if i keep his
palm greased my chief complaint is
that a vicious character like me is al-
lowed only two visitors a week not
counting lawyers


mammoth mystery

  and they wouldnt let me visit you
at all the first week and they wouldnt
let miriam come up with me ursula
removed a fleck of tobacco from her
lip im glad that youre taking it so
well alec i was afraid-i mean-
that id crack wide open i said
that i was a psychoneurotic even be-
fore they tossed me in here and that
id pound on the door and chew the
mattress

  alec please

  all right im scared i said
theres still a trial between me and
the death house but the last time the
district attorney talked to me he was
already gloating over the two thousand
volts of electricity which-

  alecl

  i stood up i walked the five paces
to the other end of the cell and lit a
cigarette i was sweating but not much
and my hand was not unsteady i re-
turned to ursula

  i can take it i said its easier
than sweating out a mission the odds
against me arent much greater than
trying to get home after bombing singa-
pore george winkler hasnt been
around in a couple of days whats
he doing about me

  i want to talk to you about that
weve retained a very big lawyer from
new york named robin magee
whats the matter with george
he will be associated with magee
george does not think he has had
enough experience in criminal law and
robin magee is supposed to be mar-
velous

  expensive as hell i bet

  does that matter

  im grateful i said when i get
out and start earning a living ill pay
you back itll cost more than you think
is george hiring private detectives
why private detectives

  to find the murderer if possible

thats what the police should be doing
but theyre so sure that im the one
that theyre not bothering

ghe didnt say anything i sat down
on the cot and stared at her her
eyes lifted there were tears in them

  so you agree wkh the police i
said slowly

  she propelled herself out of the chair
and flung her arms about me alec
its my fault i should have had that
talk with you as soon as you got off the
train i kept putting it off i wanted
you to rest after your journey but i
only made it worse for you it must
have been such a shock when miriam
blurted it out to you

  let miriam alone i said she
didnt tell me anything

  she pressed her face against my arm
i never liked lily especially not for
you but i should have let her stay in
the house until you cme home it was
only a couple of weeks

  was lily cutting up as badly as
that

  there was gossip

  is that all i said nothing but
gossip

  well she was seen drinking with a
strange man

  damn it i was on my feet pac-
ing the cell and slamming my left palm
with my right fist i wanted to break
somebodys neck but i didnt know
whose just gossip just drinking with
another man she didnt walk out on
me even after you kicked her out she
stayed around to wait for me
ursulas jaw hung slack you
thought from my actions that she was
carrying on an affair with somebody
else oh god if id minded my busi-
ness-

  i swung to face her i wouldnt have
rushed off to kill her you believe
that too
the spider lily



   the door was flung open the bean-
pole turnkey stood there whats the
yelling about

   i took a deep breath i got excited
its nothing

   well the ladys time is up if you
want any more visitors linn keep it
quiet

   ursula turned a rigidly set face up to
me to be kissed her lips were cold
alec she said  know youre not a
murderer

  sure i squeezed her arm get
the idea out of your head that lily
was murdered because of anything you
did or didnt do it had nothing to do
with you or me remind george win-
kler about hiring pri vate detectives
times up lady the turnkey said
ursula nodded dully and went

t wasnt sure what there should be
about a lawyer to inspire confidence
but robin magee didnt in me he was
a tall slightly stooped man with hair
graying aristocratically at the fringes
and he was dressed like an actor or an
english politician his breath smelled
of very good liquor

   george winkler sat on the chair and
i on the cot robin magee remained on
his feet and tossed me a benign smile
now lets hear your story my boy

   i told it to the district attorney
and i told it to george i said it
hasnt changed since then

  magee nodded amiably it may be
that you will mention something in the
retelling which you overlooked before
so i told it again there was sur-
prisingly little i bad walked in and
found lily with a knife in her heart

   there was a silence when i finished
george looked up at magee the great
criminal lawyer from new york smiled
silkily

  why did you touch the knife-
handle he asked

  i started to pull it out then i real-
ized that she was already dead

  the knife was in her heart didnt
you see that

  my brain stopped working for a
few seconds

  magee studied the ceiling they tell
me you are a very bright young man
you must have known that it was not
proper to touch a murder weapon and
that pulling the knife out wouldnt have
helped her even if she were still alive
i wasnt in a state to realize any-
thing

  you were a soldier you must have
seen many dead people

  he sounded a lot like district attor-
ney hackett questioning me but he was
being paid to be on my side i said
ive seen dead men but ive never
before walked in on my wife with a
knife in her heart did you

  magee chuckled naturally not
then how the hell do you know how
a man will act at such a time

  you were a navigator of a super-
fortress he argued you were trained
to keep your head in an emergency
there was nothing in my training
about how to act when i found my wife
murdered what are you getting at
anyway

  george put in didnt the d a ask
you those questions

  yes

  weve got to know what you told
him dont we

  thats right i agreed okay
throw em at me

  robin magee dropped down on the
cot he did not hold my hand but his
manner was so intimate that he might
have his breath made me thirsty it
looks bad my boy theres no getting
away from it there are many witnesses
that you left your house in a highly
excited state of mind-unfortunately
one of them the sheriff then you were


mammoth mystery

found bending over the body-

  i was sitting on the couch

  you were sitting on the couch and
she was at your feet and the police
laboratory found your fingerprints on
the knife and no other prints

  the murderer had wiped his off
let us grant that this morning i
had a talk with the d a he did not
tell me in so many words but he implied
that he had even more definite proof
than the medical examiners report that
she had been alive a very short time
before sheriff dowie found you there
he gave me this much to induce me to
accept a second-degree plea

  did you tell him to go to hell
in effect yes magee tapped my
chest with his knuckles my boy
winkler and i are going to get you off
absolutely free you may have to spend
a month or two in a sanatorium but
even that will probably be unneces-
sary

jt took time to pentrate i looked
from one pair of eyes to the other
both pairs watching me anxiously then
i left the cot to get as far from them as
i could and turned at the wall

   so thats it i said im insane
not at all magees honeyed words
flowed to me temporary insanity
perhaps extenuating circumstances
certainly

  in other words i said confess
that i murdered lily

  george shambled his bears body
over to me the fatherly act the
close family friend i knew what hed
say before he said it alec you know
ill agree only to whats best for you
magee is one hundred percent right
hes thought of the only way to get
you off

  get outl i said both of you
georges small eyes blinked in pain
alec as your attorneys-

  i dont want lawyers who are con-
vinced im guilty get outl

  he turned to magee for help and the
great lawyer gave me his smooth smile
naturally hes upset winkler hell
be more reasonable tomorrow good-
bye my boy

  dont come back i flung after
them

  for a long time i stood looking at the
door after he closed it my teeth were
chattering i gritted them and threw
myself face down on the cot the walls
of the cell closed in on me i could not
breathe

     they returned the next day i
had told the turnkey not to let them in
but he did i lay on my cot and stared
up at the ceiling and pretended not to
hear them as they talked down at me
as a matter of fact i heard very little
of what they said after a while they
left

jerry nugent came in briskly

    he grinned down at the chess-
board on the chair

  whats the problem he asked

  white to mate in four moves

  he studied the board youre even
better than i think you are if you can
do it

  i have plenty of time i said

  i guess you have he sprawled
down at the foot of the cpt and noncha-
lantly dug out his pipe and pouch it
was all as casual as a visit to my bunk
after wed slept off a mission

  you may remember a photo in life
of a square-jawed rugged-faced bomber
pilot standing under a wing of a b-
superfortress in an india base that
was captain kerry nugent the mo-
ment the photographers eyes fell on
him he tabbed kerry as the idealized
type of grim and nerveless american
manhood who was bringing death and
destruction to the enemy
the spider lily



  how are the ribs i asked

   as good as new practically except
that im still taied up like a prussian
general in a corset his face clouded
and stop talking like a heel about it
miriam says youre shooting a line that
you lost the plane

   i did

  ill break your damn neck if you
dont cut it out kerry sat up what
the hell i ought to have my head ex-
amined for bringing it up how about
a game of chess

   your time will be up in a few min-
utes

   not for mrs nugents boy i slip-
ped the turnkey a five spot that ought
to be good for a couple of hours give
me a knight and a bishop and ill try
to make a game of it

  i dumped the chessmen into their
box i dont want my mind taken off
anything i want to talk how did
you happen to show up at lilys place
only a few minutes after i got there
his right cheek ticked it was an old
sign of annoyance why kick it
around forget about her she got
what she deserved

  why did you go to lilys

   noisily he drew flame into his pipe
miriam sent me im a good soldier
when a lovely lady gives orders i obey
without question

  thats no answer

   i suppose it isnt kerry said sud-
denly grave im not quite straight
on it myself id gone to new york
for a couple of days i got home around
eight and my mother told me that mi-
riam had phoned earlif that you were
expected home that day i called up
helen and shed heard from her father
that you were back and she wanted to
see you too so after i ate i picked her
up and we drove over

  you and helen spencer i said
thats something new

jlie grinned shyly about six
days well you know how you
acted when we drove up and saw you
coming out of the driveway we drove
on to the house and found everybody
out on the porch talking about you
so i broke up the card game i
said

  you sure did i heard mr spencer
ask ursula if she wanted to resume
she shook her head and stood looking
out at the road then miriam pulled
me aside and told me what had hap-
pened it didnt sound like much to me
why shouldnt a guy raise hell when
he isnt told where his wife is why
shouldnt he dash off to her but
miriam said i hadnt seen the way you
looked and acted she was plenty wor-
ried she gave me the idea that the
place for you was a straitjacket or any-
where but with a wife whod been play-
ing you dirty he paused and then
added thats throwing it at you
bluntly but you wanted it

  youre doing all right go on
thats about all i argued for a
while you had every right to go dash-
ing to your wifes arms then ursula
joined the argument i was your bosom
pal wed faced life and death together
youd resent my horning in on your
affairs less than anybody else that
line they werent sure what i should
do when i caught up with you i guess
sort of hang around to keep you out of
trouble and bring you back to the old
homestead if lily spat in your face as
they more or less expected so i
went

  where was sheriff dowie

  hed driven off so had bevis and
his old man maybe george winkler
too i dont remember but when i
left all i noticed on the porch were
three women-helen and miriam and
ursula

  i walked all the way i said why


mammoth mystery

didnt you reach lilys before i did
thats why im kicking myself now
but i didnt hanker to barge in on you
two in a fond embrace my idea was to
catch up to you on the road and maybe
talk to you and calm you down or go to
lilys with you if you didnt object
strenuously so i crawled along the
road in my car looking for you when i
reached the head of james street i de-
cided that you couldnt have walked
there so soon or even run there and that
i must have missed you on the way

  i cut across the golf course

  hell i should have thought of that
i drove back slowly still looking for
you when i reached the bottom of
mandolin hill i turned around and
tried again figuring that somehow id
passed you up in the darkness this
time i went all the way to lilys i saw
a car parked outside-dowies it
turned out-and decided that if she was
having company why not me too

t sat on the other end of the cot fin-
gering the chessmen in the box on
my knees it was a cheap wooden set
the black king had lost his cross and a
white rook was minus a couple of tur-
rets ursula had kept my good sets at
home this one would do for jail

  had you seen lily before that i
asked

  since my return home kerry ap-
peared to be smoking matches instead
of tobacco once my second day in
paid my respects to my pals wife told
her you were okay and would be home
any day drank a pair of cocktails she
fixed and said so long one of those
duty calls you know i didnt care one
bit for her

  you did that night we met her for
the first time in new york

  oh then she was a lass with plenty
of pulchritude in a low-cut dress some-
thing to try to make you did and i

didnt so that was that besides you
married her and that was okay by me
until what she did to you when we were
in india from then on she was
marked lousy in my book

  how did she sound when you told
her i was coming home

  drop it aleg she was no good
its not the thing to say about a pals
wife so in india i kept my lips but-
toned but now im telling you he
twisted on the cot to fece me directly
this might hurt but i got the impres-
sion that for all she cared you could rot
in india

  it doesnt hurt i said im sorry
that shes dead but thas all

  so forget her

  i doubt if the state of new york
will let me

  kerry groped in his pockets for
matches i tossed him mine

  i could hand you a lot of boloney
about that he said after he had a light
but i wont i had a talk with george
winkler this morning hes plenty wor-
ried about the trial especially because
you refuse to be sensible

  i dont want to discuss it

  winkler is one of the people who
would give their right arm for you he
knows what hes doing

  no

  alec you dont know everything if
it came to taking a three-star fix id
back you against any navigator in the
world but this is law

  if thats all you have to talk about
i said youd better go

  his pipe stem made bubbling noises
i ought to push your teeth in he said
after a while but its your life
throw it away and the hell with you
change your mind about a game

  i submitted we sat at either end of
the cot with the board between us i
gave him a bishop and a knight but or-
dinarily he needed more than that not
the spider lily



today i barely managed to squeeze
out a draw

jytiriam caire the day that japan
     offered to surrender

  did you hear the news she said
as soon as the door closed behind her

  the turnkey told me a lot of air-
men i know are going to do a lot of
celebrating at the thought of coming
home i felt my teeth in my lower lip
i was the lucky one i beat them back
to the peace and security and comfort of
home

  she moved all the way into the cell
she hadnt very far to go as usual
she wore white she knew what it did
for her black hair and eyes and dark
skin this time it was a white shantung
suit with a black blouse very snappy
and her manner fitted the outfit cal-
culatedly cool and casual chin up and
a forced smile carefully ignore the
locked door and the gray walls too close
together and the single gash of window

  the surrender isnt official yet she
said still topically conversational
everybody is praying it will be she
handed me a bulging paper bag
brownies which i baked for you this
morning with raisins the way you
like them

  at the last sentence her voice be-
trayed her it started to quiver and
suddenly tears brightened her eyes
she stepped past me and dropped limp-
ly into the chair

  visits were too few and precious to
be thrown away with weeping over me
i could do my own weeding when i was
alone so i sat down on the cot and
tried to bring up a subject which would
interest her more than i did made
up your mind about bevis spencer

  how can i think about it at a time
like this she gave me her profile
she didnt look well too much cheek-
bone showing alec why dont you let

your lawyers help you

  because i dont want lawyers who
are convinced im guilty

  they dont george winkler told
me-

  so he sent you to talk me into it
i said

  we all want to help you

  sure i said like you tried to
shelter me from my wife

  that was a mistake we should
have overlooked everything lily did un-
til you got home

  and now you all believe im a mur-
derer and youre anxious to overlook
that you dont shy away from me in
horror youre loyal to the bitter end
and im not even grateful

  we dont want gratitude we want
you back with us

  there was no point in chasing the
subject around i dug into the paper
bag and pulled out a brownie miriam
couldnt cook as well as ursula-no-
body could-but she could bake rings
around her theyre wonderful 
said and offered her the bag thanks
a lot

  she took one and sat nibbling it her
eyes were far away alec she said
remotely you must have loved lily
very much

  did i i let the idea simmer be-
fore i spoke again i dont think so
i hardly knew her six days in all only
three of them married to her those
were fine days i was going overseas
and i guess they would have been fine
with almost any attractive woman with
whom- i stopped

  im a big girl now miriam said
into her brownie i understand
please go on

  yes and after that i was a million
miles away and she was a woman to
remember and dream about if i was
in love it was with a memory

  alec did you kill her


mammoth mystery

you had to hand it to miriam she
at least came right out with it no-
body else had asked me except the dis-
trict attorney and the police the
others skirted around it pretending to
assume that i hadnt when they be-
lieved the opposite

   no i said

   she nodded you wouldnt lie about
it if you had of course i believe you
but what was believing you thought
you did and you said you did but that
was just emotion cold reason didnt
concur

  i took another brownie did you
send kerry after me that night

  yes you frightened me if kerry
had only met you i mean he would
have gone there with you and he would
have been a witness that you hadnt
done it or if george had met you on
the way

  did you send george also

  only kerry the game broke up
and we all stood on the porch for a
few minutes george had already
driven away when kerry left the
thing is that george lives on james
street only a few hundred feet from
lilys bungalow

  i saw him put a light on when i
passed his house

  he was so close she said he
blames himself now for not having
waited for you on james street or for
not looking in on lily but how could
he have known

   did everybody leave the house after
the game

  well mr dowie was the first to
drive away bevis drove his father
home and came back a little later
helen waited for kerry to return he
was gone for more than an hour and
then he brought the terrible news she
put a hand on my knee alec why
dont you try to save yourself

   back to the lawyers i grunted

  they dont want jou to confess or
anything like that that would be
stupid george merely wants you to
listen to him and mr magee

  ive heard what they have to say
you have to have a lawyer she
said urgently i understand that you
cant plead guilty of murder even if you
want to so there has to be a trial and a
defense if george and mr magee
arent your lawyers the court will as-
sign one to you do you think you will
be better off with a strange lawyer
george says that the district attorney is
willing to accept a seccnd-degree mur-
der plea and that any other lawyer will
snatch at it george wont and you
know it he wont stop at anything to
get you off free

  she did it very well george wink-
ler ipust have coached her

  the district attorney asked me to
testify against you she went on he
has an idea that before you went down
to the cardroom i told you lily was un-
faithful to you and that that was what
made you so excited i went to george
and he told the district attorney that i
would be a hostile witness and talked
him out of a subpoena so you see
george continues to work for you
thats why the court hasnt assigned
another lawyer to you

  i sat hunched over on the cot with
the bag of brownies between my palms
this was my third week of being shut
in here with nothing to do but think
id been dealt a busted straight and the
state held a pat hand and it was a pot
i had to take or die i was scared i
hadnt stopped being scared for a sin-
gle minute since the state police lieu-
tenant had told me i was under arrest

  the door creaked open times up
lady the turnkey said

  miriam sent him a frantic look then
turned her dark wide eyes to me alec
at least let george and mr magee talk
the spider lily



to you

  i stood up and so did she and to-
gether we walked the few steps to the
door

  alec please she said

  all right send them over i told
her wearily

qeorge winkler said get
the idea out of your head that we
think youre guilty its only that the
evidence is overwhelmingly against you
and we decided that there is only one
way to get you off

  by sending me to an insane asylum
i said

  nonsense you misunderstood
magee even if that were the only way
we couldnt bring it off the da
would stop us cold by bringing in
psychologists

  how will confessing to a crime i
didnt commit help me

  thats not what we want either all
we ask is that you dont say anything
before or during the trial sit tight
leave it to us

  ill tell the truth over and over if
im asked by the da or anybody
else

  robin magee left the wall against
which he had been leaning by all
means my boy the truth in my
twenty-two years of law practice i have
lost only one client to the electric chair
and i must say he deserved it

  id as soon take the chair as a jail
sentence

  you havent a thing to worry
about magee assured me placidly
but i can promise to get you off free
only if you dont interfere with my line
of defense

  which is that i didnt do it
certainly now just relax thats
all we ask of you

  they prepared to leave but i wasnt
through with them george did you

hire private detectives

  he looked blank for a moment oh
yes detectives thats not necessary
magee has a couple of top-notch inves-
tigators in his office

  are they doing anything i asked
have they learned anything

  if anybody learns anything they
will magee said they are digging
into lilys life

  i nodded thats the right angle
maybe it was a boy friend who wanted
her to go away with him when he heard
i was coming home and he killed her
when she turned him down

  they were not impressed magee
said that is a possibility but the co-
incidence is somewhat too pat i mean
the murder occurring only a few min-
utes after you arrived after having left
your house in a state of-uh-high ex-
citement

  we were back where we had been
they hadnt changed their minds they
were merely applying soft-soap and
who could blame them my hand
couldnt be worse and i couldnt im-
prove it

  listen i said a couple of days
ago i remembered something when
i started down james street that night
a car approached from the direction of
lilys bungalow i thought the driver
might be able to tell me where she
lived and i flagged him the car was
going very fast on that bumpy road it
didnt even slow down

  george winklers bright little eyes
glittered you think it was the mur-
derer fleeing from the scene of the
crime

  it could have been

  how do you know the car was com-
ing from lilys house magee argued
you say you were at the head of the
road it might have been coming from
any of the other houses or through
from the other end of the road


mammoth mystery

the car almost ran me down i
said a fleeing murderer would be
panicky if anybody tried to stop him
did you see the license number
do you remember the make of car

  i shook my head the car meant
nothing to me then it might still mean
nothing but its worth looking into
we certainly shall robin magee
glanced at his watch take it easy
my boy i promise you again that you
have nothing to worry about

  more soft-soap after they left i
stood at the window and thought about
the car it couldnt be traced it was
just a car any car passing in the
night and there was only my word that
it had passed

  my word wasnt good for anything
to everybody it was the word of a
murderer

chapter v

for the people

g unlight poured in through one of
the tall courtroom windows and lay
warmly over the long table at which i
sat when i held my hands in the
dusty streamers shadows formed on
the table and with my fingers i fash-
ioned animated images of ducks and
goblins

  george winkler strode over from the
jurybox where district attorney hack-
ett and robin magee were examining
talesmen dont do that he said
do what i asked

  those tricks with your fingers you
look too nonchalant you might give
the jury the impression that youre
hard-boiled

wtiats taking them so long
george chuckled its a delight to
see magee work hes challenging
everybody who hasnt at least one son
in the service wives of soldiers wont

do obviously because lily was the
wife of one magee insists on sons par-
ents of boys like you hackett is chal-
lenging those magee accepts but its a
losing game for him because our armed
forces are so large theyre up to the
twelfth juror i realize this is dull
alec but whatever you do dont act in-
different to the proceedings

  i felt the grim and passionless bulks
of my two nursemaids at either shoul-
der they had guns on their hips and
handcuffs dangling from their belts
they conducted me to and from my cell
in the county jail and for lunch to the
daytime cell behind the judges cham-
ber in the courtroom they were frozen
beef planted behind my chair four
walls made me feel freer than they did

  i said to george if i act the way i
feel ill start chewing the table

  that mightnt be a bad idea
george said

  county judge farrier leaned his gray
mane toward the jury box is the jury
satisfactory to the defendant

  instantly the courtroom was silent
the jury is satisfactory magee said
loudly

  is the jury satisfactory to the
people

  the jury is satisfactory hackett
said

  the jury will stand and be sworn

rjhis was it there was a stifling
hush as before a storm i felt the
emptiness in the pit of my stomach
that i used to feel when we took off on
a particularly tough mission with
weather conditions uncertain only
this would be tougher than the worst
of them

  the clerk droned the roll i twisted
around in my chair between the solid-
ity of the guards i could see ursula and
miriam in the front row of benches
ursula caught my eyes and managed a
the spider lily



wan smiling-through-tears smile mi-
riams profile was strained and tight as
she listened intently to the jurors being
sworn in

  near the rear of the room kerry nu-
gent and helen spencer sat together
bevis spencer came down the aisle and
whispered briefly to his sister and
kerry quiet i  the bailiff at the rail-
ing gate snapped bevis flushed and
moved on to sit beside miriam there
were others in the room i recognized
men and women i had known half of
my life it was quite a party

   i turned back to listen to the district
attorney who was rising to address the
jury he was a plump soft-spoken man
whom i would have liked under differ-
ent circumstances he told the jury that
for weeks and months i had planned the
murder of my wife and that only a few
hours after returning to west amber i
had rushed to the bungalow and
plunged a knife into her heart

  then it was robin magees turn he
had a voice that thundered and wept
and sneered and whispered within a
single sentence he said that lily had
been an evil woman anf that i was a de-
cent and patriotic boy and he sat
down	 

  there wasnt much for the first cou-
ple of hours the county medical ex-
aminer said that a sharp instrument
commonly known as a steak knife was
driven into the body at a point approxi-
mately three and a half inches below
the left shulderblde anteriorally and
penetrated the heart to a point an inch
above the apex imbedding itself di-
rectly between the fifth fcnd sixth ribs
without emerging from the body in
his opinion she had not been dead more
than an hour when he had first seen
the body at eleven oclock the night of
the murder and his post mortem at wil-
lowbys funeral parlor the following
day had verified the time of death ap-

proximately anyway magee let him
step down without cross-examination
a state police lieutenant told how he
and sheriff dowie had taken me to the
county jail

  a buxom woman named mrs jo-
sephs stated that she had rented the
bungalow to mrs lily linn on july
th the bungalow had come complete-
ly furnished including a set of six steak
knives of which exhibit a was one

  a sergeant from the state bureau of
criminal investigation testified that the
only fingerprints on exhibit a were
mine

o	obin magee rose to cross-
examine for the first time lan-
guidly he sauntered to the witness
stand almost i expected him to sup-
press a yawn he must have seen a
great criminal lawyer act like that in
a movie

   tell me sergeant he drawled did
you test the five other steak knives in
the kitchen for fingerprints

   yes sir i did

  why

  its routine you can never tell
whatll be important so we dust every-
thing in the place

  laudable diligence im sure did
you find fingerprints on the five steak
knives in the kitchen drawer

  well on one was a smear of mrs
linns right thumb and on another a
pretty good impression of-

  no prints on the other three
knives

  no sir washing them had re-
moved the prints

  wouldnt whoever dried the knives
have replaced prints on them

  it depends on how theyre dried
most women hold a few pieces of cut-
lery in a towel and take one end of the
towel and dry them like that then
they drop the cutlery into the drawer


mammoth mystery

without having touched it except with
the towel

  in short there were probably no
prints on the murder knife when the
murderer removed it from the drawer
probably not but as soon as he
took the knife out of the drawer he put
his prints on it

  but not if he wore gloves magee
said in that case the knife could have
been plunged into mrs linns heart
without fingerprints appearing on it un-
til the defendant alexander linn en-
tered and touched the knife

  if he wore gloves i guess so
one more question sergeant could
fingerprints have been wiped from the
knife-handle while it protruded from
mrs linns breast

  the silence in the courtroom deep-
ened

  you mean the sergeant said slow-
ly take a rag or a handkerchief and
wipe the prints off the knife-handle
without removing the knife from the
body

  exactly

  i dont see why not the sergeant
said

  magee strolled back to our table
thats the way it happened i told
him excitedly the murderer either
wore gloves or wiped off the prints after
he killed her

  magee shrugged at best its a
negative point but it helps confuse the
jury

rjhe sight of that sleek face streap-
lined by a narrow mustache made
me think of bars at a bank tellers win-
dow and a name-plate reading mr
e schneider and a mechanical
remark about the weather as he passed
ursulas bankbook back to me

  his loose-jointed body lounged in the
witness chair as it had never dared in
the stiff formality of the bank cage his

full name was emil schneider he was
thirty-seven years old and had worked
at the west amber national bank for
eleven years he had become ac-
quainted with mrs lily linn when she
had come to the bank to cash her army
allotment checks

  how well acquainted hackett
asked

  schneider crossed his legs the ju-
rors leaned forward magee and george
looked at each other i felt my hands
clench

  it was like this schneider said aft-
er a pause one mo rning a year ago last
april mrs linn came in to make a
deposit and asked me casually if i knew
of a house for sale in the neighborhood
she said if she found just the right thing
shed like to buy it and have it ready
when her husband came home from the
war i was about to recommend a real
estate broker but suddenly i saw the
chance to make a good commission for
myself i knew of a house for sale out
in the big oaks section so i told her
id be glad to drive her around late that
afternoon to take a look at it

  was she interested in that house

  it was too big for her i promised
her that id keep my ears open in a
bank you hear a lot about houses for
sale and whenever i heard of one i
took her to see it but the ones we
saw didnt satisfy her or were too ex-
pensive

  what happened on the night of
july st

  that morning i heard of a good buy
near new hollow it was farther from
town than mrs linn wanted but it was
worth a try i phoned her in the after-
noon but couldnt get her home mrs
hennessey told me shed moved out that
morning in the evening i heard mrs
linn had rented the josephs bungalow
and had moved in already i phoned her
there
the spider lily



  at what time

  around ten oclock

  can you be more exact

  i remember looking at my watch to
see if it wasnt too late to call her up
it was five to ten when i picked up
the phone

  who answered

  mrs linn

  i looked at george and then at ma-
gee neither of them appeared to be
greatly disturbed in my statement to
hackett i had said that i had reached
lilys house shortly after ten oclock
besides dowie had found me there a
few minutes later didnt they realize
how bad schneiders testimony was for
me

  you are absolutely certain that it
was mrs linn at the other end of the
wire hackett said

magee drawled objection on the
grounds that no proper foundation has
been shown that he knew her voice
he called her house didnt he
hackett said angrily

  and spoke to a woman thats all
thats certain it could have been any
woman at the house at the time
hackett turned to the judge let
the counsel show no proper foundation
in the cross-examination

  suits me magee said smugly and
sat down

  what was the substance of your
telephone conversation hackett
asked schneider

  i told her about the new hollow
house and she asked me to pick her
up next afternoon when i knocked off
work	

  what time was it when you hung
up

  five minutes later ten olclock
when did you next hear from or
about mrs linn

  next morning i heard at the bank
that shed been murdered during my

lunch hour i went to you to tell you
id talked to her the night before
you were very cooperative mr
schneider that will be all

jobin magee sauntered over to
the witness almost he yawned in
schneiders face you have a great
deal of confidence in the accuracy of
your watch

  its the one im wearing now it
never loses a minute schneider
smiled besides as soon as i hung up
i went into the living room and turned
on the radio for the ten oclock news
it had just come on

  was anybody with you when you
made the phone call to mrs linn

  i was alone at home

  you have a wife and two children
i understand

  yes

  were they at home at the time
they were visiting my wifes mother
in vermont

  magee rubbed his chin reflectively
you say that mrs linn consulted you
about a house as long as fifteen months
ago

  about that long ago

 and you showed her houses
throughout that period

  wtienever i heard of something
which might interest her

  didnt you get discouraged

  i stood to make from five hundred
to a thousand dollars commission that
kind of money is encouraging

  didnt it seem to you excessively
ardent salesmanship to see mrs linn
at least once a week for a period of
fifteen months

  schneider uncrossed his legs it
wasnt that often

  did your wife leave your bed and
board last may and take your two chil-
dren with her to her mothers house in
vermont and not return to you


mammoth mystery

  schneiders nonchalance was gone
it all belonged to magee now i heard
a stirring behind me among the spec-
tators

  we had a fight schneider said un-
happily

  because of lily linn

  no my wife and i hadnt gotten
along for years

  what were your relations with mrs
linn

  i-we- past magees shoulder
schneider stared at me

  everybody stared at me i had risen
from my chair and stood with my
knuckles pressed down on the table
the hand of one of my nursemaids fell
on my shoulder and pressed me down to
the chair i ran my fingers through my
hair i was trembling

  what were your relations with mrs
linn magee asked again

  schneider sat back i dont know
what you mean we had a business
relationship of course

  i am referring to an intimate per-
sonal relationship

  hackett leaped to his feet to make
a vigorous objection

  i wondered why you didnt object
before the judge said he scowled
down at magee objection sustained
breezily magee waved a hand i
withdraw the question for the present
i reserve the right to recall schneider
for the defense if necessary 

  when magee returned to the table i
leaned into his whiskey breath
schneider is lying i whispered lily
had no money to buy a house she was
always complaining in her letters about
being broke he murdered her he lied
about that phone call

  magee patted my arm you leave
him to me hes going to be a mighty
sick man before the trial is over
you mean you can prove he mur-
dered her

  hardly that but as one poker
player to another watch the way ill
call the d as hand

hphere were four women on the jury
and eight men all middle-aged or
older i tried to make something out of
their set attentive faces separating
each from che other but they remained
a blurred entity a dozen faceless
people you could have picked out of
any crowd but they would decide
whether i burned in the electric chair
or rotted in prison or walked once more
among my fellow men

  hackett was reading from a sheet of
paper i yanked my mind away from
the jury and heard

        dont see why you cant man-
age on the allotment you receive as
the wife of a first lieutenant plus
whatever else i send you out of my
pay unlike most other officers
wives you don- even have to pay
rent

  whats that i asked george
winkler

  dont you recognize your own
letters george said theyre the
ones you wrote to lily from india
hackett found them in her bungalow
and is reading excerpts into the record

  is he allowed to make public my pri-
vate mail

  george motioned to me to let him
listen

  hackett was reading

cant you ever write about any-
thing but that youre bored or havent
enough money you dont even
bother any more to throw in a casual
mention at the end that you love me
oh i understand its being sepa-
rated for so long it must be even
the spider lily



 harder on you than on me well
 make up for it when i get back

   the next letter was dated a month
 later it read

   needless to say the news in your
 last letter that you drove all the way
 to new york with billy-whoever or
 whatever he may be-to a night club
 and started back to west amber at
 four in the morning and drove till
 noon has brightened my days and
 made my nights restful now i face
 each mission with stalwart heart
 confident that my wife is loyally
 keeping the home fires burning

   im not jealous i dont expect you
 to shut yourself away from the world
 and make yourself sick pining away
 for me i dont mind your seeing other
 men now and then though perhaps
 trips to new york with men named
 billy is-

   damn it i am jealous not be-
 cause of what you write but because
 of what you dont i assume that you
 are faithful but you might make as
 much mention in your letters of me
 as you do of your billy s you might
 even say that you miss me

   i knocked my chair over as i jumped
 up you cant read those i said
 theyre personal 

   i dashed for hackett he put the let-
 ters behind his back and tried to hold
 me off with his free hand then my two
 guards reached me and each grabbed
 one of my arms all twelve jurors were
 on their feet to see better affd the court-
 room was in chaos the judge banged
 his gavel i was sputtering unable to
 find words to express my outrage

jhe judge said something and ma-
gee and george collected my arms
from the guards and ied me to the bar

gradually quiet resumed behind me
the judge gave me a lecture he said
that i was on trial for my life and that
those letters were evidence and that he
would not tolerate such conduct i was
wondering what more could be done to
me but he didnt say magee led me
back to my chair and i sat sweating and
trembling and helpless

  hackett had more he read

  today everybody got mail from
wives and sweethearts there were
letters for me too-one from miriam
and one from george winkler the
letter from miriam was sent out air-
mail only eight days ago she said
that you were well but no letter
from you none in seven weeks are
you so busy with your various billys
that you cant spare five minutes to
drop a line to your husband this
morning kerry nugent asked me
why i looked so glum lately i told
him that if i could get leave to go
home and strangle my wife id come
back a new man

   george sent a frown past me to ma-
gee not so good hackett is trying
to show that while still in india alec
planned to murder her

  thats only an expression men are
always using about women that they
want to strangle them i said cant
you make that clear

   magee patted my shoulder ill take
 care of those letters when the time
 comes have you the letters your wife
 sent you they would be useful on our
 side

   they weent the kind of letters id
 want to keep i said fiercely and
 even if i had them you wouldnt get
 them

   hackett was still reading i kept my
eyes fixed on the top of the table i
was ashamed to look at anybody


mammoth mystery

jevis spencer stumbled over the
oath sent a startled glance at me
sat uneasily at the edge of the chair

  is bevis going to testify against
me i asked george in surprise

  hackett subpoenaed him he was
unhappy about it and had an idea i
could get him out of it i couldnt of
course

  you got miriam off

  hackett wasnt keen on having her
to begin with george said he de-
cided that her testimony would work
against him as a matter of fact magee
wants her for the defense but she re-
fuses to take the stand i stopped ma-
gee from getting tough with her
bevis spencer told how he had ar-
rived for the saturday night poker game
half an hour after his father and george
and dowie he had remained in the
living room to spend a few minutes with
miriam then i had come in and asked
to be alone with her

  what was the defendants demeanor
when he entered hackett asked

  quiet the way he usually was in all
the years id known him he looked a
lot older though than two years ago
he didnt get excited till later

  how much later

  two or three minutes i was in the
hall on the way downstairs to the card-
room when i heard my name and
stopped to listen bevis squirmed on
the edge of the chair id just asked
miriam hennessey to marry me and i
heard her tell alec that alec has a lot
of influence with her and i wanted to
know how he felt about my marrying
her

  we can understand a perfectly hu-
man action hackett said graciously
was anything said about lily linn
they started off by discussing me
then suddenly alec wanted to know
where lily was staying he said hed
found out that lily wasnt living with

them any more and he got very excited
by them you refer to his sister
ursula hennessey and her ward mi-
riam hennessey

  yes

  you stated that the defendant be-
came very excited hackett said
what do you mean by that

  he started to shout

  what did he say

  i didnt hear any more i went
downstairs to the cardroom because
wha i was listening to wasnt any of
my business

  bevis went on to tell about the scene
in the cardroom when i burst in a few
minutes later he tried to make it
sound mild but hackett wouldnt let
him he said that after the game broke
up he had gone out on the porch with
the others his sister helen and kerry
nugent had pulled up in a car

  did captain nugent remain long
hackett asked

  he left a few minutes later in his
car i heard miriam ask him to try to
bring alec back

  to prevent the defendant from
going to his wife

  bevis somber lace was miserable
well alec had become psychoneurotic
in the air force and he-

never mind that hackett said
quickly youre not a psychiatrist
magee chuckled i wondered why
i was just telling you the reason
they were worried about him bevis
said alecs nerves-

  never mind im interested in the
defendants actions when he learned
where his wife was staying

  well he rushed out of the house
  without pausing

  he was out of sight when i got to
the porch

  hackett smiled and walked away
magee smiled also and waved bevis off
the stand
the spider lily



gheriff owen dowie peered
about myopically and then brought
his pale eyes to rest on hackett who was
waiting for a reply to a question
noisily dowie cleared his throat
properly speaking i didnt arrest the
defendant i handed him over to lieu-
tenant searson of the state police im
only a peace officer

  tell us what happened the night of
july st

  id been invited to play a little
poker at mrs ursula hennesseys
house just a harmless little game in a
private home between friends nobody
could call it gambling

  there were titters in the courtroom
the judge worked his gavel without
passion

  hackett said dryly poker is a
great american institution and i am
sure the sheriff is as human as the rest
of us

  like i said a friendly little game
well around eight oclock that night
oliver spencer phoned me and asked
if id pick him up in my car on the way
his boy bevis had taken the car over
to the store he was taking stock and
would be late so at eight-thirty i
picked up oliver spencer when we
got to mrs hennesseys house george
winkler had just arrived in his own car
we stood out on the driveway talking
about alec linn whod just got home
spencer and winkler said linns wife
had been cutting up while he was away
and they were worried hed find out
and-

  magee made a motion to strike out
the judge granted it haskett said to
dowie please confine yourself to
facts

  but everybody knew lily linn was
running around with-

please hearsay is not admissible
oh all right then we went up to
the house and the defendant himself

opened the door for us he didnt want
to come down to play with us id heard
that he was a whale of a poker player
and i was anxious to play with him
but he didnt want to so the three of
us went downstairs to the cardroom and
played knock rummy till mrs hen-
nessey finished washing the dishes and
then we started a four-handed game of
stud it wasnt fun playing four hands
especially as mrs hennessey whos a
sharp player wasnt paying attention to
her cards then around nine-thirty or
a little before bevis spencer came
down and joined the game but it
didnt go much better because we could
hear the defendant yelling-
yelling

  talking in a very loud voice he
was with miriam hennessey in the liv-
ing room right over our heads

  did you hear what the defendant

said

  no just his voice very loud sud-
denly he came dashing down into the
room his face was all twisted up and
he yelled he wanted to know where his
wife was mrs hennessey tried to
quiet him but he started swearing and
yelled over and over he wanted to know
where his wife was it was mighty em-
barrassing for all of us

  can you recall definite words that
the defendant uttered

towie removed his glasses he
said i know what lily was up to
while i was away george winkler
tried to reason with him and the de-
fendant told him to mind his own-
pardon me-damn business and the
defendant said i know exactly what
im going to do to my wife 

  are you sure those were his exact
words

  maybe he said he knew what to
do with his wife instead of to his wife
i didnt take what he said down in


mammoth mystery

shorthand ask the others theyll
agree im close enough then mrs
hennessey told the defendant that his
wife lived on james street and with-
out another word he ran out like there
was a fire we could hear him running
in the upstairs hall and slam the front
door

  what happened then

  mrs hennessey didnt want to play
any more and i guess the rest of us
didnt either we all went outside i
told oliver spencer id drive him back
to his house but he said his son bevis
would drive him home so i got in my
car and drove off by myself

  what time was that

  a quarter to ten i looked at my
dash clock when i got into my car the
defendant had left around five minutes
before i drove home my wife hadnt
come back from her knitting club-it
was still early-so i drove down to town
and had a beer at lous on division
street all the time i was thinking
about what had happened at the house
id heard the stories- dowie hesti-
tated you dont let me tell the stories
id heard

  you can tell us why you went to
mrs linns bungalow

  it was on account of what had hap-
pened in the hennessey house and what
i knew about mrs linn and that boy
running out of the house like a wild
man im a peace officer its a twenty-
four-hour job after a while i made up
my mind that that boy the defendant
wasnt in a fit state to go busting in on
his wife i dont say i had any idea of
murder but just the same i was wor-
ried i figured there was no harm driv-
ing past mrs linns bungalow when
i got there all the lights were on but
it was very quiet everything looked
all right i drove up that little dirt
driveway at the side of the house so i
could turn around but i didnt back

up i could see through one of the win-
dows into the living room andthere was
the defendant sitting with his head in
his hands i watched him he didnt
move i got out of the car and walked
to the window and saw a woman on the
floor i ran around to the front door
and went in

  what time was this

  fourteen minutes after ten
according to emil schneiders testi-
mony only fourteen minutes after
schneider had spoken to mrs linn on
the telephone did she apear to be
dead

  im no doctor but a knife was in
her heart and she had no pulse i could
find

  what did the defendant have to
say

  he didnt say anything at first
captain nugent came in right after me
then the defendant said he didnt kill
her

  what else

  he just sat there on the couch his
feet almost touching the dead woman
till the state police came and lieuten-
ant searson led him out of the bunga-
low then the defendant said my
fingerprints are on that knife i said
what do you expect he said you
dont understand i started to pull the
knife out without thinking i said
do you want to make a statement
now he said ive made my state-
ment i didnt kill her 

  did you take a close look at the
knife in the womans heart

  sure it was just like dr abies
said he found it

  how was that

  i couldnt see the blade the han-
dle was in up to that gown she was
wearing

  it wasnt halfway out

  well maybe a little way out there
was that thick gown like i said be-
the spider lily



tween it and her	skin but not not
halfway out

  thank you	sheriff hackett

turned to magee	your witness

o obin magee tapped two fingers
over a yawn tell me sheriff
how long was it between the time you
saw lieutenant linn on the couch and
the time you entered the bungalow
maybe forty seconds no id say
at least a minute i cut the ignition and
got out of the car and looked in the
window and went around to the front
door

  had lieutenant linn moved in that
interval of a minute

  hackett came forward your honor
there has been no l ieutenant linn men-
tioned whom does magee mean
magee beamed at the da you
know very well i mean first lieutenant
alexander linn of the army air
force

  if by that he means the defendant
he is not in any way any longer con-
nected with the air force

  the judge clucked his tongue i
dont see where it matters my father
was called colonel for twenty-five years
after he retired from the army con-
tinue

  what difference did it make whether
i was electrocuted as lieutenant alex-
ander linn or as plain alec linn none
if the battle of legal wits concerned my
guilt or innocence but i was beginning
to get the idea that that wasnt the
point at the trial at all

  magee repeated did lieutenant
linn stir during the minffte between the
time when you first saw him and when
you entered the bungalow

  not a muscle

  did you hear captain nugents car
pull up into the driveway

  yes

  how did lieutenant linn react

when he heard that car

  he looked up and listened

  lets go back a few minutes while
you were in your car after you had
pulled into the driveway was it possible
for any person in the premises to leav
without being seen by you

  he could have gone out the door on
the other side of the bungalow-the
door out of the kitchen

  but lieutenant linn remained in
the bungalow

  he just sat there with his head in
his hands

thats all magee sauntered away
there was silence then hackett
stood up the people rest he said

chapter vi
for me

t trsula wore a black-and-white
print dress and a black cartwheel
hat she looked chic as the fashion
magazines put it but not so obtrusively
smart that the rather dowdy women
jurors would resent her there were
tired and frightened lines at her eyes
and mouth but she strode to the witness
stand like a man in a hurry her deep
voice though tense and somewhat sub-
dued filled the courtroom she spoke
of the early life of her kid brother

  i couldnt see what that had to do
with the case but robin magee consid-
ered it important now that the wit-
nesses were his magee assumed a dif-
ferent character he was genial sym-
pathetic a man to receive confidences

  alec was a shy and sensitive boy
when he came to live with me ursula
said he never got over it he be-
came even more indrawn if anything
he would have long spells of brooding
and suddenly without warning he
would flare up into fits of temper

  i stared at her but she was careful


mammoth mystery

not to look in my direction she was ly-
ing about me id been no different
than any other boy except perhaps that
id been somewhat more even-temp-
ered the flare-ups came later the
night id returned home why was she
trying to tear me down

  was he unfriendly magee asked
not at all alec was-and is-the
sweetest and most devoted boy i know
he has many friends everybody likes
him but hes-well he takes every-
thing extremely seriously

  they kicked my character around
some more before they came to the
point which was lily

  one day alec brought that woman
home ursula said it happened so
quickly without preparation she was
beautiful i suppose but in a hard
flashy way she claimed to be twenty-
two id put her age closer to thirty
but alec was very much in love with
her and was going overseas in a very
few days so miriam and i accepted her
as heartily as we could even when
alec asked us to let her live with us
until he returned we put on a good face
there wasnt anything we wouldnt do
for him

  how did you and miriam get along
with mrs linn

  there was little friction though she
seldom helped with the housework she
went her way and we went ours

  do you recall the conversation you
had with mrs linn on the morning of
july th

  that was the morning i asked her to
leave the house her conduct had be-
come outrageous

  please explain that

  the night before miriam saw her
disgustingly drunk in public with
strange men that was too much i
simply could not let her remain in my
house

  what happened when lieutenant

linn returned home on july st

  i didnt break the news to him that
i had asked his wife to leave the house
i told you how seriously he took every-
thing on top of that he had been sent
home because his nerves were very
bad

ltackett objected that she wasnt
an authority on nerves the judge
sustained him

  anyway ursula said i kept put-
ting off telling him you must under-
stand how i felt

  im sure we all do mrs hennes-
sey magee said sympathetically he
was through with her

  ursulas testimony hadnt contrib-
uted a thing to show that i was inno-
cent it wasnt meant to the idea
was to compress my character into a
mold i was one person to the prose-
cution and another to the defense take
your pick-a coldly calculating killer
or a sensitive high-strung lad who had
suddenly gone haywire through no fault
of his own

  hackett had his turn at the mold i
understand mrs hennessey that since
childhood your brother has been some-
thing of a mathematical genius

   alec is clever

   and that at his last two years at col-
lege he was the intercollegiate chess
champion

  yes

  and that hes a ioker player of ex-
traordinary skip

  ursula frowned he is very good
in short his various laurels and
honors show that in that science and in
those games of skill which require a
clear and exact mentality a trained
ability to think ahead and plan con-
cisely and without emotion your
brother excels

  ursula opened her mouth but magee
beat her to the punch your honor
the spider lily



thats not a question

  i phrased it as such hackett re-
torted mrs hennessey as the sister
with whom the defendant lived and
who saw him through school is cer-
tainly an authority on his scholastic
abilities

   they wrangled in front of the bench
but i didnt hear any more of it i
turned furiously to george winkler

  you lied to me both of you magee
isnt defending me hes trying to show
that i wasnt psychologically respon-
sible and hackett is trying to show that
i was i havent yet heard magee deny
that ive murdered lily

   hes working every possible angle
george whispered this is only one
of them give him a chance

  ursula was stepping down from the
stand i subsided-at least to the ex-
tent that i kept my mouth shut

ite said that his name was ogden
garback and tha he worked in his
fathers garage in wes amber he was
nineteen a nice looking lad slim-hipped
and broad-shouldered he grinned
nervously and told magee that he
wasnt in the army because of a bad
kidney

   it was just before chrjstmas gar-
back said last christmas it was
after eight and i was locking the pumps
when mr schneider pulled up for gas
and there was a woman with him who
wasnt mrs schneider

  emil schneider who is employed at
the west amber national ank
magee asked

  yes sir he gets all higas at my
fathers place

who was the woman in the car
mrs linn bill beaty was hanging
around waiting for me to close up so we
could bowl a few games and when they
drove away bill told me who she was
when did you see mrs linn

again

  one afternoon just after christ-
mas the garage is only a quarter of a
mile from the station and she came
walking up in the snow and said there
was no taxi waiting and would i drive
her home to mandolin hill pop told
me to go ahead and i took the car but
i clean forgot to collect the dollar for
driving her

  how did you do that

  i just forgot i guess it was because
she was talking so much asking me all
about myself when i got back to the
garage i remembered about the dollar
and called her up and she said come
around for it at nine she was waiting
out on the road when i got there she
said did i want to spend the dollar
drinking beer with her and i said sure
and we drove to mikes on new hollow
road bill beaty was there with a
couple of fellas and he came over to
our table and said hello to her and we
took turns dancing with her then i
went out to the-the-he looked out
in embarrassment at the many eyes fo-
cused on him-well i went out for a
few minutes and when i came back
mrs linn and bill were gone

  is the bill you refer to william
beaty now in the navy

   yes sir

  when did you see mrs linn 
again

  a couple of days later she called
me up at the garage and said she was
sorry shed walked out on me and would
i pick her up on the road at nine so
i did

  where did you go with her

  no place we drove for a while
and then parked

  did you make love to her

  the kid flushed she let me kiss
her a few times then she said we
should go home

  did she say why


mammoth mystery

  garback looked as if he were search-
ing for a hole to jump into she said
i-i was a nice boy and too young for
her and i shouldnt see her any more
magee didnt like that he didnt
want to hear any good about lily and
you didnt see her again

  i called her up a few times but she
always turned me down

  did she continue to go out with wil-
liam beaty if you know

  yes sir lots i saw them together
in bills car

  what were his relations with her
if you know

rjhe kid wiped his mouth it was
plain that he had had it bad for
lily and i could understand that and
how he must have felt when she had
dropped him after a kiss or two and
how it must have hit him to have known
all the time that his friend bill was hav-
ing better luck with her

  with my wife that had been my
wife they were speaking about

  well sir garback said bill al-
ways told me every time-

  no give me your own observa-
tions

  well sir you dont think i was
around to see- garback flushed
the boisterous laughter which swept
the courtroom had to be silenced by the
judges gavel one saturday bill
stopped off at the garage for gas mrs
linn was with him while i was filling
the tank he told me they were driving
to new york and hoped they wouldnt
get back till next day and next day
sunday they passed around twelve
oclock coming back theyd been to-
gether all the time and theyd spent
the night in a tourist cabin in-

  i was on my feet trembling pulling
my arm out of georges grip what
has her personal life to do with this
trial i shouted shes dead why

not let her alone

  the guards shoved me down

  hackett said your honor i agree
with the defendant ive been giving
magee plenty of leeway but i fail to
see-

  youll see if you give me a chance
magee told him

  they threw legal jargon at each
other i chewed on the knuckles of
my clenched hands and felt all those
eyes on my back

tvtagee must have won his point be-
cause hackett shrugged and
walked away the judge said to me
the defendant will please restrain
himself he said it kindly he was
sorry for me so was everybody else in
the room not because i was being
tried for murder but because i had
been married to a woman like lily

  magee was back at the witness stand
did emil schneider ever speak to you
about mrs linn

   yes sir

  what did he say

hey hackett protested then he
added irrelevanr and immaterial
magee turned to the bench will
the court take it subject to correction
the judge looked interested he
nodded magee repeated the question

  well garback said he came to
the garage one afternoon and said hed
break my neck if i didnt keep away
from mrs linn

  when was that

  about the beginning of february
i told him he was barking up the wrong
alley but he stayed sore and asked
what did i know about bill beaty going
around with her i said to go ask bill
and he did and bill told him to jump
into a lake then a few weeks later
bill was drafted

  and that left the field clear to
schneider
the spider lily



  move to strike out hackett
growled

  i withdraw the question magee
said grinning

uelen spencer had been the
prettiest girl in high school she
had had a heart-shafed face and red
cheeks and warm gray eyes and wavy
honey-colored hair falling to her shoul-
ders she still had all of that but she
was trying to change it-to look world-
ly and sophisticated by aid of an up-
swept hairdo and a long clinging dress
and sleek make-up and scarlet finger-
nails they didnt do the trick she
was still a peaches-and-cream girl

  why yes helen said i became
rather friendly with lily linn im a
friend of miriam hennessey and came
to the house rather often and lily
seemed to like me she knew every-
thing about the latest styles and took
me shopping with her and helped me
fix my hair and all that

  did you go out on dates with her
magee asked

  helen looked over his head i turned
and everybody else who was facing her
turned oliver spencer her father
stood in the back of the courtroom with
his hat in his hand when he realized
that he was suddenly the focal point of
attention he stopped chewing his lower
lip and assumed a deadpan

  last month two men came up from
new york to see her helen said slow-
ly lily told me they were old friends
and asked me to fill out the second cou-
ple we went to a roadhouse in tre-
van

  when was this

  on the fourth of july lily got very
drunk and started acting disgracefully
right out in public letting this man don
who was with her make love to her and
everything

  everything

  well paw her even though he had
been her husband-

  husband magee exclaimed

  her first husband-the one shed
divorced

  i found that i was sitting forward
with my mouth hanging open i closed
it

  magee glared at her why didnt
you tell me when i spoke to you last
week that mrs linn had been married

before

  didnt i helen said serenely i
thought i did when i told you about
that night at the roadhouse

  you merely said that they were two
men from new york

  the judge rapped impatiently
please dont argue with your witness
counselor

  george winkler growled in my ear
you didnt mention to us that lily had
been married and divorced we could
have brought her first husband up here
and perhaps have got something out of
him now its too late

  this is the first time i heard of
him i said

  there was a great deal about lily i
hadnt known and still didnt i yanked
my attention back to helens testimony

  i never heard his second name
she was saying lily called him don
short for donald

  it may be she just called him
don

  all right go on

ptelen glanced again at her father
in the rear of the room and then
quickly down at her knees lily was
very drunk and so was don he asked
her to go away with him she laughed
and said theyd never get along to-
gether but she didnt stop him pawing
her then don said ill settle for a
few days in miami lily said what
about that she-cat youre living with


mammoth mystery

shell hardly approve don said he
didnt care what she thought if she
didnt like it she could-

  wait magee broke in who is
this woman youre talking about

  helen raised her head and lowered it
they didnt mention her name then
lily told don she couldnt leave west
amber for even a day because shed
just got word from alec that he was
coming home from now she said
shed be a good girl and don said
and make a home for this hick and
raise babies lily made a sour face
she said for my part id rather have
his insurance than him 

  this was the worst kick of all right
in the pit of the stomach all along id
assumed that whatever she had done
was out of boredom but those others
hadnt even been substitutes for me
shed preferred that i be killed in action
so that she could collect my insurance
i wanted to crawl away somewhere and
lie alone with my face in my arms

  helen was telling the rest of it don
and the other man-his name was wal-
ter-laughed drunkenly and don said
to lily that shed gotten herself stuck
good and proper that made lily
angry but im sure that if she hadnt
been very drunk she wouldnt have said
what she did in front of me she said
how was she stuck if for two years
shed been living on an officers pay and
in a fine home where she didnt have to
pay board she said maybe shed like
alec when he came home she didnt
know shed even forgotten what he
looked like it would be stupid to walk
out on him now if she decided she
didnt want him when he came back
she was sure his sister who had money
would buy her off to take her hooks out
of him

  are these mrs linns exact words

  as far as i can remember lily went
on like that she said she was going to

be a very good girl at least till alec
came home and that would be very
soon then my brother and miriam
hennessey came n and saw how lily
was carrying on with don bevis in-
sisted on taking me right home and i
was glad of it

  did youee mrs linn after that
she called me jp the next morning
she was sober and knew i was a friend
of alec and the family and realized
shed made a mistake blabbing in front
of me she asked me to come over so
that she could explain

  was she still living in mrs hennes-
seys house

  no shed left that morning and it
was the bungalow on james street
when i got there mr schneider was
arguing with her

  what about

  they stopped when i came in but
i heard a little when i went up to the
door lily told him that he mustnt see
her again because her husband was
coming home mr schneider was beg-
ging her to go away with him
anything else

  then i knocked and mr schneider
was very embarrassed when i came in
he left right away lily told me to
forget what shed said last night in the
roadhouse she had only been pulling
dons leg she said i told her the truth
had come out when shed been drunk
and i walked out

  and that was the last time you saw
her

  helen looked dowil at her crossed
knees yes she said

jmil schneider was limp and
scared when he returned to the
witness stand magee was merciless

  you are aware that you are under
oath magee said crisply

  yes

  did your wife leave you because of
the spider lily



lily linn

   yes

  when you phoned mrs linn on the
night of july st you did not have
real estate on your mind did you

   i asked her if i could come over
   what did she say

   she said no she said shed made up
 her mind not to see other men until her
 husband came home  she said there was
 enough talk about her already

  do you know whether she was
aware that her husband had returned
that evening

she didnt say anything about it
magee jabbed a finger at him ill
ask the question i started to ask yester-
day were you intimate with mrs
linn

  i-it wasnt-

  answer mel

   there were no bones in schneiders
loose body only a few times

   in short yes

   yes schneider whispered

touring the recess in my daytime
cell in back of the courthouse i
said angrily so youre not going to try
to prove im innocent youre double-
crossing me 

   george winkler sighed and moved in
on me to apply so ft-soap but magee
waved him silent he handed me his
flask of very good rye i took a deep
slug and so did magee but george
shook his head then magee said all
right my boy well do whatever you
say what should we do

youre the lawyers j muttered
were not supermen you heard
the d as case he showed that you
were aware of your wifes unfaithful-
ness-

   i wasnt not quite you were the
one who spent all morning giving me
the motive to kill her

  -and that you rushed out of the

house and that fifteen minutes after
she was known to have been alive you
were found sitting next to her murdered
body and your prints were on the

knife

  i explained about the fingerprints
it was an explanation the only one
you could possibly make do you think
the jury will believe you put yourself
in their place would you have a
shadow of doubt as to your guilt

  i was boxed in i groped for a way
out the murderer is this man don
her former husband to whom she re-
fused to go back

  derisively magee lifted the corners
of his mouth yesterday you said it
was schneider

  perhaps it is schneider he was
madly in love with her and she wouldnt
go away with him

  why leave out ogden garback
whom she kissed and then dropped
magee shook his head the d a has
made out an excellent circumstantial
case we cant do a thing to counter
it can we

  i wanted more of magees rye but
i didnt ask for it i set fire to a
cigarette

  george said but magee will get
you off just the same you ought to
appreciate how clever he has been
helen spencers testimony was wonder-
ful kerry nugents will be even bet-
ter

  i ground the cigarette under my heel
the unwritten law i said bitterly
temporary insanity extenuating cir-
cumstances but not that im innocent
neither of you believes that i didnt do
it

  of course we do my boy magee
lied suavely

  well im going to tell the jury the
truth when im on the stand

  there was a silence then george
said softly were not going to put


mammoth mystery

you on the stand alec

  why not afraid ill tell them im
innocent

  magee handed me another of his pats
on the shoulder you cant help your-
self and you might harm yourself
everything is going fine now why run
the risk that youll antagonize the jury
youll be too pugnacious

  i dont care

  my boy do you want to live no
youll live anyway they wont send
you to the chair do you want to spend
from twenty years to life in jail

  the walls pressed so close that i
couldnt breathe through a window at
my side i could see a patch of cloudless
sky i wished i were up there not
cooped up in a bomber but flying free
and alone at ten thousand feet in a
single-seater

   have it your way i said listlessly

jerry nugent made a splendid
figure on the witness stand he sat
at ease in his natty uniform with the
impressive double string of ribbons on
his deep chest but his rugged face was
stiff with earnestness he could utter
sheer nonsense and whatever he said
would carry weight i could see it in
the faces of the jury sense it among
the spectators kerry wouldnt let them
convict me

  he told of our boyhood together he
made it sound idealistic and maybe it
was a couple of clean healthy decent
kids devoted to their family-in my
case to my sister-and when they grew
up responding at once to the call of
duty when their nation was in danger

  alec and i went together to enlist
in the air force kerry said that
was in our senior year at college
what kind of boy was he magee
asked

  brighter than most at school he
took honors right and left especially in

math i went out lor athletics but he
was the studious type high-strung
thought a lot about everything used
to lie awake nights dreaming up new
chess openings temperamental some-
times hed almost bite my head off for
no reason though i dont mean that
he wasnt oneswelh guy

  you two enlisted as soon as you
graduated from college

  a couple of months before but it
wasnt till fall of that year before we
got our orders alec was a natural for
a navigator after we received our
wings we were put on b-s we were
about to be shipped to the european
theater when i was transferred to the
new b-s i pulled wires to get alec
assigned to my ship so we stayed to-
gether the b-s werent flying yet
they were just coming off the assembly-
lines in kansas city and wfe had to train
for them and we-	

  tell us about the weekend you and
lieutenant linn spent in new york be-
fore flying to india

  we got ten days leave and spent
the first few days of it at home there
was a party in greenwich village alec
and i were invited to wre decided to
have a last fling and went down to new
york by train and registered overnight
at a new york hotel at that party
we met lily yard

  yard magee looked startled
don yard was yard her maiden or
her married name

j wouldnt know thats the
name she gave us i saw her first
and made a power dive for her alec
was right behind me she was worth
rushing-tall and slim and platinum
hair and a build you d pin up in your
locker any day alec won out that
was okay by me there were plenty of
other- kerry wet his lips anyway
alec didnt go back to west amber with
the spider lily



me next day he was at the municipal
building with lily getting a marriage
license that quick but you know how
it is a man is going into combat and
the odds are he wont come back espe-
cially if hes in a tomber so why not
grab what you can while you can get
it i dont mean he wasnt crazy in love
with her besides as for lily-well
you heard about her she saw a chance
to get herself an officers allotment and
maybe his insurance i saw her once
more when he brought her home then
a couple of days later we flew to africa
and from there to india

  did he talk to you about her
nothing else but he called her the
lily the lily she looked like one-
the tall white kind anyway-but thats
not all he meant pure as a lily vir-
ginal you know

  i know weve heard a great deal
of her purity this morning magee
sent a look at the jury and the jurors
made their faces grimly angry when
lieutenant linn reached his base in
india did he hear cften from his wife
that just it he didnt you cant
imagine what letters meant to us unless
youve been in it yourself especially
letters from the woman you love she
didnt write often you could hear
alecs heart crack when he received a
fistful of mail and thered be nothing
from her she was the only one he
wanted to hear from then after a
year the letters she did write became
worse than none at all the other day
you heard his answers to some of her
letters those were just his answers
you should have seen the letters she
wrote him

  lieutenant linn showed them to
you

  sure we shared all our letters no
matter how intimate they were you
share death in the sky so you share
the rest of yourself on the ground i

dont know why women do certain
things maybe theyre bored home
alone they blame the war and take
it out on you it wasnt just lily
ive seen wives and sweethearts do it
to other men because you need them
so much and think about them so much
they have a knife in you and they take
pleasure in twisting it not all women
not many but more than youd think
lily was one-anyway after the first
year it was a little tiling she had to
do write more often and lie in her let-
ters if she didnt feel affectionate but
when lily wrote she twisted the knife
all she could nagging about money
for instance it got so bad that alec
went into a couple of those big crap
games we have at the club but crap is
straight gambling and instead of mak-
ing more money for lily he dropped a
couple of hundred bucks he was even
ready to play poker but he didnt

  it has been testified by mrs hen-
nessey that lieutenant linn is an ex-
ceptionally skillful poker player if he
wanted money couldnt he have made it
that way

cure the trouble is that most men
play with a hunch and a prayer
they havent any idea of percentages
or the fine points the way alec plays
it its not gambling he got into a
couple of small games and then stopped
it wasnt fun for him it was like tak-
ing candy from children

  tell us more about mrs linns
letters

  it wasnt only the nagging for
money she complained about every-
thing she hinted that there were
other men in her life without coming
right out and saying that she was sleep-
ing-that she was actually being un-
faithful to him

  how did lieutenant linn take it
  bad lord knows all our nerves


mammoth mystery

were jumpy enough what with mon-
soons and heat and snakes and scor-
pions and bugs and hardly any white
women and having your closest friends
die all around you and being afraid all
the time till it was a relief being up in
the air and looking death right in the
face so you see alec had enough on
his mind without worrying about his
wife he was navigating one of those
huge crates over one of the toughest
runs in the world i never know how
navigators do it we pilots get the
glamour but we just have to be men
without nerves and quick in a pinch for
maybe a minute or two at a time we
have co-pilots and robots to relieve us
but a navigator sweats blood every sec-
ond of a mission thats why youll find
the high-strung very bright boys are
the navigators like alec theyve
got to keep themselves at a high pitch
and when on top of that they have
something nagging on their minds all
the time the way alec had-well it was
plain murder on him he got the jit-
ters he didnt eat or sleep enough
then we lost the ship on our twenty-
third mission

  how did that happen

  one of those things we were
knocked about by flak over the target
and then six nip fighters hit us by
the time we chased them off theyd shot
up the radio and almost got alec to
add to our troubles the weather turned
to pea soup below us and we couldnt
see what was downstairs and after a
while alec told me we were lost

  you were responsible for all the men
on the plane werent you captain

  i was the skipper

  would you say as an experienced
skipper knowing the men in your crew
and responsible for them that lieuten-
ant linns ragged nerves caused him to
make a serious mistake

 no he- kerry saw magee

raise his eyebrows and he sat back
those things happen lots of times he
said quietly a navigator isnt god
he can be pretty near perfect-and
alec was tops-but worrying about a
wife and being kicked around by flak
and having your rado gone and being
a thousand miles from the base-well
you see it dont you we were flying
at twenty thousand feet and couldnt
see our outboard engines i tried to go
below the weather and we got a bad
scare our altimeter showed fifteen
thousand feet but our positive alti-
meter only two thousand we werent
over water at all as we should have
been there were mountains below us
at least thirteen thousand feet high and
if you know anything about-

jvf agee yanked kerry back to land
iva what happened finally

  alec got us through anyway
within a couple of hundred miles from
our base we were out of gas by then
so we had to hit the silk

  you were hurt when you jumped
captain

  a couple of ribs bashed in one of
the men was killed though sergeant
bilkin a swell-

  what happened to lieutenant
linn

  nothing physically but he
cracked wide open he said it was his
fault he lost the ship and bilkin got
killed if it was anybodys fault id
blame lily linn the flight surgeon
grounded him of course

  and lieutenant linn was dis-
charged as a psychoneurotic magee
said triumphantly

  no they dont discharge a highly
experienced officer so easily from the
air force especially if hes so far
away he was assigned to ground
duty

  magee frowned at him in annoyance
the spider lily



  but soon after he was given an
honorable discharge wasnt he cap-
tain

  six weeks later the war in eu-
rope had ended and they were being
easier on discharges and just about that
time our entire wing of b-s was
transferred to the marianas the shift
was what really got alec his discharge
the co didnt think it worth while
sending a case like alec to the pacific
so he sent him home to his wife
thats right his wife

  but theres no doubt that lieuten-
ant linn was mentally hurt magee
persisted you were his skipper and
his closest friend you lived with him
and faced death wih him how seri-
ous was the psychological harm-
hackett protested vehemently
your honor captain nugent is a
pilot certainly not a qualified psy-
chiatrist

  do you deny his qualification to
testify that lieutenant linn was
grounded for being psychoneurotic
magee retorted

  hackett stood firm your honor
why hasnt the defense brought in quali-
fied psychiatrists to examine the de-
fendant because magee hasnt dared
to he knows that the defendant is
perfectly normal

  sustained the judge said mildly
proceed

  the words on that side of the room
went on kerry told how miriam and
ursula had asked him to go after me
and how he had found me in lilys
bungalow after that hackett had a
go at him but it didnt take long and
i was no longer listening i felt as if i
had been run through a wringer and
tossed into a damp cellar where i would
never regain my shape

  then i heard magee speaking loud
and clear through the hush the de-
fense rests

chapter vii

the verdict

t kept my eyes fixed on an inkspot

  on the table but there was no get-
ting away from robin magees voice
i had to sit and take it holding my
shame inside of me

  look at him ladies and gentlemen
of the jury magee orated impaling me
with a pointing finger do you see a
vicious murderer seated there no
you see a boy like your own boys-a
boy raised right here among you who
went to school with your children who
played with them and fought with
them a boy you would have wel-
comed to your home and have been glad
to have your daughter know a small-
town boy if you will not worldly per-
haps not hardened to recognize evil in
its most insidious form that i sub-
mit was his only crime

  had he ever before harmed a soul
the eminent prosecutor much as he
would have liked to has not been able
to indicate a single misstep a single
moral deficiency in his character on
the contrary we have heard from cap-
tain nugent how this boy refused to
take advantage of his comrades in arms
through his superior poker skill al-
though that would have been perfectly
legitimate how many men could you
find who would have acted with smilar
ethics and yet the prosecutor has the
hardiness to contend that this boy with
so highly developed a sense of fair play
could conceivably premeditate murder
no matter how great the provocation

  i have never in all my years of ex-
perience before the bar represented a
client of whom i think so highly id
be proud to call lieutenant alexander
linn my son and when his country
called its young men to arms he was
among the first to respond enlisting of


mammoth mystery

his own free will ladies and gentlemen
in perhaps the most hazardous of the
services need i dwell on how he dis-
tinguished himself need i read a list
of his citations for heroism need i
detail the incomparable courage he
shared with all our airmen with all our
soldiers and sailors and marines with
your own sons and daughters who are or
were in the service

  ladies and gentlemen lieutenant
linn fought the good fight for his coun-
try but always riding in the bomber
with him as he bent over his charts and
maps was his enemy not the japs
they could be faced squarely and
destroyed by guns and bombs this
enemy was more relentless more heart-
less and there was no defense against
her though she was fifteen thousand
miles away this enemy was the wom-
an he had married

  the japs could not bring him down
but his wife did he became a casualty
of her assault psychoneurotic the
army doctors call it a big word mean-
ing that he was wounded in the mind
he became subject to violent outbursts
of temper and the responsibility lay
clearly with the woman who caused it

  need i tell you more about this
woman you have heard and your
blood ran cold as did mine his hasty
marriage to her may have been a fool-
ishly impulsive act but understandable
when emotions are violently torn by
war when a boy is to go forth to battle
not knowing whether he would ever
again see his home and family and a de-
sirable woman he loved her for her
face and figure and the mantle of decep-
tive virtue she wore to trick him the
lily he called her no doubt for its age-
old symbol of purity and loveliness but
if lily she were it was no true lily but
a spider lily you must have seen them
in the woods growing wild and un-
tamed the spiderwort called spider lily

which for all its superficial beauty has
no right to the title the lily-the
spider lily the lily who was a spider
weaving her insidious web to entangle
whatever human fly came her way

  how she must have laughed to her-
self at his-blind adoration-this big-
city temptress at least once married
and divorced eager for the embrace of
any man who would have her-this
vampire bringing her wickedness to the
good people of west amber to corrupt
its nineteen-year-old youths like ogden
garback to break up its homes like the
schneider home

  did she give a hought to the man
with whom she had taken the sacred
pledge to love and honor and who was
hourly facing the untold dangers for the
security of his country in a far and dis-
tant land yes she thought of him
while in the arms of other men she
thought of the money she was receiving
as the wife of an officer while on
drunken orgies she thought of how con-
venient it would be i he were destroyed
by a japanese shell and his insurance
would come to her

  ladies and gentlemen of the jury
murder was done it was done to this
fine clean-cut heroic young lieutenant
of our glorious army air force this
vile temptress from a big city this un-
speakably evil woman murdered his
mind and soul as surely as if  

rjhe jury was out eighteen minutes

  it filed back almost jauntily and
the foreman said happily we find the
defendant not guilty

  there was a rush for me hands
grabbed my right hand to shake it
robin magee thumped my back and
put his whiskey breath against my face
we did it my boy c idnt we

  district attorney hackett stood in
front of me extending a hand i tried
my best linn but i cant say im sorry
the spider lily



i took a licking this time like a true
sportsman like an opponent in a game
of skill congratulating the victor

   i didnt kill her i said

  i spoke loudly but nobody seemed to
hear me or else my words washed over
them without meaning

  soft arms were flung around my
neck ursula held me close to her
bosom everything will be all right
now she said then miriam kissed
me or wanted to bui her mouth sobbed
against my cheek over her shoulder
i saw kerry grinning as he worked his
way toward me

  george winkler grabbed my arm
come over and thank the jury alec
they expect it

  i tore away from him and stood pant-
ing against the table i didnt kill her
damn it listen to me i didnt kill
her

  abruptly the area around me became
quiet magee reached out for my shoul-
der i shook him off and pushed
through the crowd about me brushing
kerry aside and ursula and others i
opened the rail gate and went up the
aisle people stood ihere they moved
back against the sides of the benches
to make room for me to pass

  the stillness had spread throughout
the room i heard eet behind me fol-
lowing i did not turn

  cant you let him alone miri-
ams voice burst out

  i reached the dcuble doors they
were open i went through them my
footsteps were the only ones to echo
down the long courthouse hall

  it was late afternoon and the sun
slanted down the broad courthouse
steps i could go where i pleased do
what i pleased no more bars no
four walls too close together

  i was a free man i was a man
everybody thought had murdered his
wife

chapter viii

the sympathetic people

jhat saturday morning i took two
showers during the second
shower i heard ursula go out to the
back yard and miriam wasnt home so
i walked naked up the hall to my room
i sat at one of the windows and let what
breeze there was wrap itself around
my damp body

  it was now one oclock and since id
awakened at eight i hadnt dressed or
left the room except to take the showers
and at around ten to duck down to the
kitchen in my pajamas for an orange
and milk the late august heat
wasnt responsible it was nothing to
what i had taken in my stride in india
i should be up and doing-sending out
feelers for a job tinkering with the
car mowing the lawn i didnt even
read i sat naked at the window

  at one-thirty bevis spencers sedan
pulled into the driveway below my
window sitting behind the wheel he
appeared to be as unclothed as i ex-
cept for a rolled towel over his shoul-
ders the right front door opened and
miriam got out she was wearing too
little for anywhere but a public beach
or the privacy of her own room a
white terrycloth robe was over her arm
in the back seat were kerry nugent
and helen spencer both wearing beach
robes they were home early prob-
ably because this was saturday and
bevis had to get back to his store

  before the war we took those out-
ings often-a bunch of young boys and
girls piling into one or two cars and
driving eleven miles in bathing suits
to corde lake where the county had
built a public beach the girls put up
picnic lunches and if the weather was
particularly hot wed build a fire when
it got dark and sprawl around it singing


mammoth mystery

 and telling stories and making mild
 love and occasionally drifting off two
 by two for another dip or to put
 ourselves beyond the revealing glow of
 the fire in those days helen spencer
 had usually been my partner

   they had been fine times and in
 india kerry and i used to talk about
 them in fits of nostalgia and how one
 of the first things wed do if and when
 we got back and if it was summer would
 be to go out to corde lake i taking
 lily and he any girl who was around
 and pleased him

   well we were back and kerry had
 been out to corde lake with a girl and
 i was sitting at my window watching
 them return nobody had asked me to
 come along i was out of it

   the car drove away the semi-cir-
 cular driveway lay empty under the
 fierce sun i heard miriam enter the
 house and stop to talk to ursula in the
 downstairs hall

   sitting became impossible i walked
 back and forth across the room twice
 before i remembered that i wanted to
 dress i put on ducks and a white
 basque shirt and left the room

   miriam was coming up the stairs
 she looked wonderful in a bathing suit
 -or more likely she was one of the few
 women who objectively looked better
 without any clothes on she had long
 thighs and no belly and her skin was
  burnished tawny-gold contrasting with
 the very white of the two negligible
 strips of satin lastex

   i stood looking at her waiting for
 her to speak first she plucked un-
 easily at a loose thread in her terry-
 cloth robe over her arm then she said
 weve been swimming

   obviously i said

   she attempted a smile i was going
 to ask you to come along alec but
 you were still asleep when we left

   what you mean i said is that

nobody wants a crazy murderer at a
swimming party or at any other kind
i moved past her down the stairs
she remained silent it wasnt until i
was turning into the living room that i
heard her feet resume their ascent

  ursula was in the dinette setting the
table for lunch she studied my face
anxiously and seemed pleased at what
she saw you look rested alec i
thought sleep would be better for you
than breakfast

  i leaned against one of the posts of
the dinette arch after i left the house
that night-the night lily was killed-
what did you do

  for heavens sake alec isnt there
anything pleasanter to talk about
ursula where did you go after
kerry drove away to look for me

  i didnt go anywhere

  all the men left i persisted
you and miriam and helen remained
in the house were you all together
ursula straightened a fork beside a
plate and took time to reply evi-
dently she decided to humor me some-
body must have to d her or she had
read in a book that with people who
were psychologically off balance the
placating technique was in order so
she said amenably i went downstairs
to the cardroom and counted out the
chips at everybodys place you see
theyd left without figuring up then
i played solitaire until kerry came with
the news that you had been arrested
i could have guessed that when
ursula was upset or bored she played
solitaire

  where was miriam i asked

  i believe she went upstairs to her
room

  was your car in the driveway all
that time

  after kerry returned with the ter-
rible news i could hardly think of put-
ting the car away it was outside
the spider lily



all night

  did you hear a cai drive away when
you were in the cardroom

  the placating technique was too
much for ursulas temperament her
tone sharpened alec youve got to
stop brooding over the-the death
you can call it the murder i said
thats what it was

  what have these questions got to do
with it

  you cant solve ari equation without
knowing all the terms

t trsula went into the kitchen and
seconds later returned with three
glasses of tomato juice will that
bring her back to life she said irri-
tably as if there had been no break in
the conversation youve been ac-
quitted so why worry about it

  i dont like to be considered a
killer i retorted did you hear a car
leave the house a few minutes after you
went down to the cardroom

  my voice had risen and her last few
sentences hadnt been calmly spoken
it was becoming an argument and that
in ursulas book was bad for me

  she took a breath and returned to
humoring me if i did hear a car i
didnt pay attention so many cars had
been leaving at the time i remember
hearing a car arrive some time later and
a man came into the house and
call miriam i assume that it was bevis
because he was in the living room with
miriam when i came up quite a while
after that she couldnt resist a mildly
sarcastic dig i suppose all this is of
vast importance

  probably not i said

  i sat down at the table and drank my
tomato juice ursula went through the
swinging door i heard miriam come
down the stairs and go up the hall into
the kitchen she ard ursula deliber-
ately kept their voices low so that i

wouldnt be able to hear what they said
i took four soundless steps across the
dinette and listened at the door

  miriam was saying after whats
been done to him he has all the right
in the world to ask questions

  hell never get over it if he doesnt
get his mind on something else ur-
sula replied

  i was back in my chair before mir-
iam came into the dinette without
looking at me she took the chair oppo-
site me and reached for her tomato
juice she was sore at me she had a
right to be

  im sorry for what i said on the
stairs i told her naturally you
wouldnt want an odd man to horn in on
your party of two couples

  all of us were anxious to have you
with us miriam insisted the door
swung inward and ursula stuck her
head through the opening youll have
to blame me alec miriam was going
to wake you but i wouldnt let her
you need all the rest you can get her
head disappeared

  i buttered a roll and took a bite so
the night of the murder you went up to
your room after the men drove away
i said

  ursula must have prepared miriam
for my questions she replied readily
i lay on my bed i was-upset then
bevis returned after having driven his
father home and called me from down-
stairs i went down and we sat in the
living room until kerry arrived
with -helen

  no she was in the living room
when i went upstairs but i didnt see
her again until she came into the house
with kerry when he returned

did you hear a car drive away right
after you went up to your room
the road is so close that if id heard
any i would have assumed it was pass-
ing miriams dark eyes widened


mammoth mystery

alec you dont think that any of us-

  i saw how my questions were fright-
ening her the implication of them
frightened me toobut i had become
used to it gradually she was getting
it suddenly right between the eyes

  right now im after all the informa-
tion i can get i told her most of it
wont be of any use none of it might

tvtiriam nodded in a remote sort of
way she wore black slacks and
a yellow blouse she looked almost as
good in them as she had while practi-
cally undressed in that negligible white
bathing suit bevis would get more than
any man i knew when he got her

  when are you and bevis getting
married i asked trying to cheer up
the talk

  im not sure we will miriam said
unhappily

  is it fair to keep the poor guy dan-
gling in midair

  i suppose not but i couldnt give
him an answer while you were in jail
now i have to face the problem again

  if you loved him enough there
wouldnt be a problem

  the kitchen door swung open and
ursula entered with three plates of
creamed eggs on toast if miriam is
going to marry anybody she should
marry you she declared briskly

  i felt suddenly cold id had a wife
and there wasnt anybody who didnt
think id killed her i said bitterly
nobody wants to marry a man she be-
lieves likes to stick knives into his
wives

  miriam gasped i turned my head to
her in surprise she was on her feet
her lips were quivering and her high-
boned cheeks had gone hollow she
strode out of the room

  whats come over her i asked
ursula

  ursula dropped one of the plates in

front of me so that it rattled i hope
you choke on that what fun do you
get out of hurting her

  i didnt say anything to her it was
to you

  shes gone through hell since you
came back from india its not only

that she iovbs you--

  everybody loves me i cut in
everybody tries to shelter me i mur-
dered my wife-or youre all convinced
i did-but im a sick man and must
be treated like a child

  ursula plumped her big body down
into her chair i wish you were a
child so i could pul you across my knees
and spank you miriam is the only
person who doesnt doubt you at all
but you do

  too late ursula realized that she had
brought it out into the open but she
didnt hedge i dont know she gave
it to me frankly it doesnt make any
difference to me one way or another as
long as youre a free man or to mir-
iam either thats why what you just
said to her was so cruel abruptly her
voice and face softened alec why
dont you marry her its the best
thing you could do

  so thats it i said youre work-
ing to get my mind off lily and the mur-
der you think marrying miriam would
do it besides it would be cozy for
you it wouldnt break up the house-
hold it would keep us all together
howll you bully miriam into it
you idiot shell marry you the
moment you ask her

  i started to eat i was hungry af-
ter a minute i said i suppose she
would-out of pity or because she
thinks it her duty

youre so clever ursula said
scornfully you know everything
i dont know the one thing i must
know i said and thats who mur-
dered lily
the spider lily



 fter lunch ursula sent me down-
town with a grocery list she pre-
ferred to do her own shopping but she
was anxious to give me something to
occupy me

  i drove downtown in the car the
curbs were jammed solid with saturday
afternoon shoppers i rolled along di-
vision street hunting for parking space
close to spencers food market a
small man was getting out of a car on
the gutter side i almost brushed him
with my left front fender and stopped
mr dowie i called

  he peered at me through his thick
lenses well linn im glad to see
youre a free man he said somewhat
embarrassed i hope you dont hold
anything against me

  you did your duty

  sheriff dowie nodded i couldnt
do anything else fact is i was sure
youd get off under the circumstances
no jury could find you guilty for what
youd done

  i opened my mouth but i didnt say
it repeating to everybody that i
hadnt killed her was a waste of breath

  youre sister is angry at me dowie
went on she told me so before the
trial maybe i shouldnt be sorry she
isnt inviting me to any more poker
games it was costing me too much
money those two spencers are sharks
and your sister and winkler play a
mean game well glad you take it that
way he started to move toward the
rear of my car to get around it

  wait a minute i said did the
police check on schneider phone call
to my wife that night

  dowie came back to the window
the telephone company cant tell
which of eight parties on a rural line
makes the call

  but a call was made

 the company doesnt make a
record of a local call

  then theres only schneiders word
that lily was alive at ten oclock i
said

  dowie leaned against the door to get
a better perspective of my face what
would schneider gain by lying about the
phone call dont forget he went to
hackett of his own free will to tell him
hed spoken to your wife at ten oclock
im not disputing that he spoke to
her i said but i wonder if he didnt
speak to her in person at her bungalow
at ten oclock

  dowie missed it completely look
here linn dont you start up with
schneider because he fooled around
with your wife

  it wouldnt do any good to suggest
that perhaps schneider had done some-
thing beside make love to lily that
night so i said dont worry and
put the car into gear dowie stepped
back against his own car

  ahead the driver of a light truck was
getting behind the wheel i shot for-
ward and eased in at the curb as the
truck rolled out and i was parked
within a hundred feet of spencers food
market

jdevis spencer in his long white
coat was behind one of the three
checking counters he was too busy to
see me i wheeled a basket wagon
through the mob

  somebody said congratulations
mr linn les shayne who delivered
ursulas laundry was beaming at me

  i looked down at his gnarled out-
stretched hand and then up at his face
congratulations for what

  he withdrew his hand they were
taking five to one at the barber shop
youd be acquitted les shayne said
cheerfully i took two bucks worth-
on you of course i told the boys theyd

never-

  i swung my wagon away from him


mammoth mystery

and one of the wheels nicked a womans
heel she glared at me but i had no
apology for her i hated her and les
shayne and everybody in the world
the trial had been a circus a sporting
event on which to bet and the fact that
i had beaten the law was cause for con-
gratulations if they had despised me
for a murderer it would have been easier
to take

  i stopped beside the refrigerator and
looked at the shopping list it was
shaking in my hand the words on it
blurred i wiped mist out of my eyes
there was butter on the list by the
time i had it out of the refrigerator i
wanted to kick myself it wasnt
shaynes fault hed only tried to be
nice to me like everybody else i
looked around for him and saw oliver
spencer coming toward me

  mr spencer didnt try to congratu-
late me he said amiably i hope
well have some poker tonight with you
alec

  im not sure ill play i muttered

  i hear masterson will be there he
always makes a fast game

  i guess i have nothing else to do
then i remembered the thing i had to
do twenty-four hours a day until the
end if i ever reached it can i see
you alone mr spencer

  he looked at me speculatively then
nodded i trundled my wagon to the
rear of the store and followed him into
his office

  why was helen afraid of you when
she was on the witness stand i asked

  mr spencer pressed the back of his
thighs against his cluttered desk and
patted his bald pate afraid of me

  thats the idea i got it seemed to
me that she left out a lot in her testi-
mony

  he said sourly im glad she had
the sense not to drag the spencer name
in the mud more than she did

  so she did leave a lot out

  my daughter is a good girl and that
woman you married wasnt

  and you objected to helens being
friends with lily

  i intended to see that my daughter
remained a good girl he was roused
to anger theres another thing you
and helen used to go out together i
didnt object at the time i even looked
forward to you-well it would have
been a good match suddenly ill at
ease he fumbled at a button on his
white coat i always liked you alec
i cant excuse what you did to your
wife no matter what she was but im
glad you werent found guilty his
eyes lifted defiantly but now i want
you to stay away from helen

  i held myself together fighting to
keep my voice under control all that
was when helen and i were kids
that may be b ut now you have no
wife and she is very pretty and perhaps
you are still fond of each other youre
not the man for her

  afraid that itll become a habit
i said feeling my voice go to pieces
that any time i dont like the way a
wife of mine acts ill stick a knife into
her

  mr spencers eyes dropped i turned
to the door

  alec he said gently perhaps i put
it too crudely i have nothing against
you personally but my only daugh-
ter-

  i understand i said and kept
going

chapter ix

afternoon of a mathematician

tjevis spencer tapped on my
shoulder while i was waiting with
my basket wagon at one of the checking
counters hi alec
the spider lily



  i nodded briskly

 his somber face clouded he
leaned close to my ear i had to tes-
tify at your trial i was subpoenaed i
tried to make whatever i had to say
sound as good for you as i could

  you didnt hurt me

   i tried not to lie said

  a clerk at the vegetable section called
him and he bustled off bevis was a
different man in his fathers store his
awkwardness was left outside he
moved about with efficiency and assur-
ance supervising and trouble-shooting

  the unfamiliar business of ration
stamps floored me at the checking
counter but the girl checker was
pleasant and patient i doubted if id
ever seen her before but she called
me mr linn and the girl at the next
counter was giving me sidelong glances
word must have passed around that i
was in the store i was the most no-
torious resident of west amber

  while i was putting the bundles on
the back seat of the sedan i heard my
name called bevis spencers long body
in its flapping white coat moved rapidly
along the sun-baked sidewalk i closed
the car door and faced him

  alec he blurted you have no ob-
jection to me have you

  as what

  as miriams husband

  her opinion is the one that counts
i know but- bevis regarded the
tip of his cigarette dad says hell
make me an equal partner in the store
when i marry its a good store the
best in the country and ill have a big
income	

  shes the one to tell it to

  ive told her everything i can to
convince her ive never loved another
woman and i never will and she likes
me im sure she does

  if she didnt she would have turned
you down the first rime you asked her

  that is it he said eagerly she
cares enough for me to be undecided
maybe she doesnt quite love me yet
but she will ill make her love me
his deep-set intense eyes bored into
me alec if youll tell her to marry
me-

  im not her master

  of course i dont mean tell her ad-
vise her she thinks the world of your
opinion if youd just sort of men-
tion that you dont object to me as her

husband-

  shes got to make up her own mind
i guess thats so but you dont
object to me do you

  i dont if miriam doesnt i
laughed mirthlessly speaking about
objections your father just got through
telling me to stay away from helen
hes afraid ill marry her and then
shove a knife into her

  so thats why you were huffy in the
store im not responsible for dad
you think the same way every-
body does

  bevis searched my face anxiously
youre not still in love with helen
you neednt worry

  you have me all wrong id back
you to the limit with helen dads
crazy

  that was only kid stuff besides
shes kerrys girl now

  kerry is okay bevis flipped away
his cigarette well back to work
see you at the poker game tonight

t headed toward home when i
came to the old mill road intersec-
tion i changed my mind and swung
right while i was at it i might as well
make a clean sweep of the spencer
family and the hell with oliver spencer

  i hadnt visited the spencer home
since my third year at college when
helen and i had started to drift away
from each other the house was a


mammoth mystery

sprawling single story of many wings
which had grown with the prosperity of
the food market from a three-room box
helen spencer was on the side field-
stone terrace she reclined with a book
on a chaise longue she wore navy blue
shorts and a flowered halter no shoes
or stockings

  did you hear the news she said
excitedly kerry wrote to his com-
manding officer for another thirty-day
leave and he got it

  thats swell i sat down beside
her fine bare legs her toenails were
scarlet did lily teach you to paint
them

i got the idea from her she wig-
gled her toes dont you like it
not any more what did you leave
out from your testimony at the trial
nothing perhaps a few details
what were they

  helen asked me for a cigarette and
lay back puffing on it she had an
enticing body as smoothly rounded as
a babys without being tubby

  dad has a store and everybody
knows him so i didnt want to say any-
thing that would cause gossip she said
presently this last year i went out
several times with lily on double dates
i dont mean that lily got men for me
except once but sometimes lily asked
me to bring my date along whoever it
happened to be that night and make a
foursome

  whom was she with

  generally bill beaty until he was
drafted and twice this spring emil
schneider after his wife left him she
stirred her hips uneasily you must
think im awful alec going out on
dates like that with your wife but they
seemed harmless i didnt know till the
trial that she was actually having affairs
with those men and she was very
sweet to me i didnt know a thing
about clothes or makeup and what to

wear with what till she taught me

  i twisted around for another look at
her toenails lily was a glamour girl
from new york i said she took
you under her wing she liked you or
was bored and wanted somebody to
work on she dressed you and painted
you	

  why shouldnt i look smooth
helen said defensively

  smooth as lacquer

  you liked it in lily

  did i the question was to my-
self and the answer too complicated to
think about

  helen said i admired her and
wanted to be like her i mean so beau-
tifully turned out and sophisticated
i dont mean the other thing - with
men after what happened at the
roadhouse on the fourth of july i be-
came disgusted with her

  what about that

jt was the way i told it at the
trial i didnt keep any of that
back i wanted to help you that was
the first and only date i let lily get for
me her ex-husbard don drove up
from new york wth a man named
walter and lily asked me as a favor
to come along for walter i didnt like
him at all he had a long face that was
as blank as a wall aid small eyes that
had no expression except when he
looked at me and then they seemed to
be undressing me but i must say this
for him-he never tried to make a pass
at me well you heard at the trial
how lily got very drunk and let don
paw her right in public and what she
said about you then bevis and
miriam came in for beer and dancing
and they saw what was going on at
our table and they took me home i
was glad to go i can tell you you
can imagine the battle in our two
houses that night eevis told dad and
the spider lily



he-

  two houses  said

  your house was the other one of
course i learned from bevis next
day that lily hadnt come home till
dawn and that miriam had waited up
for her and then miriam had given it
to her with both barrels the argu-
ment woke ursula she came down
and tried to make peace between them
but miriam said she wouldnt stay in
the house with lily and that one of
them had to leave

  i had the impression that it was
ursula who had the fight with lily
no - miriam in fact ursula
didnt want to do anything about lily
till you returned they were expecting
you home in a week or two but mir-
iam refused to listen she started to
pack up to leave so what could ursula
do lily was kicked out and that af-
ternoon she rented the bungalow on
james street

 there was a silence

  go on i urged

  you heard at the trial how she
phoned me that evening to try to ex-
plain away what she had said about you
while drunk i found emil schneider
with her thats about all

  no it isnt i said you held back
something important at the trial
helen turned her eyes to the sun and
closed them against the glare pearls
of sweat were on her upper lip don
yard hit dad you wont tell any-
body

  no

  it was my fault andjdads too i
didnt want to have anything more to
do with lily then one saturday eve-
ning-it was a week before you came
home-she phoned me she said she
had a party and needed more women
and would i come i was about to say
no but dad was listening in on the ex-
tension in his room he broke in and

told me not to dare go so- she
paused

  so you went

  her round chin jutted im not a
child he and bevis tried to make me
use less makeup and objected to some
of my clothes then this dad had no
business ordering me around like that
then he came out to the hall and or-
dered me again not to go if hed only
told me in a different way- her bare
shoulders shrugged i went without
changing my clothes there was quite
a party when i reached the bungalow
don and walter and two other men had
driven up from the city with a woman
her name was bertha-i never learned
any of their second names she was a
stunning redhead who dressed beauti-
fully though she couldnt hold a candle
to lily she and lily kept making
catty remarks about each other i think
it was because of don

  why should lily have cared i
said she hadnt wanted to go back
to him

  you know how women are espe-
vially women like lily who can get any
man they want she didnt want dor
but she didnt want anybody else to
have him either i think bertha hated
her because she was afraid lily might
decide to take him back some time
perhaps im wrong it was only a
notion i had actually i wasnt there
more than twenty minutes then dad
came in

ij elen seemed suddenly cold in the
hot sun it was awful no-
body but lily knew who he was but
there was something about the way he
stood there looking at them and at all
the liquor and then at me that made
them very quiet it would have been
all right even then if lily hadnt opened
her big mouth she said why dont
you let the kid have some fun pop


mammoth mystery

dad went over to lily and slapped her
face and don hit dad on the jaw

  i rose to my feet and stood there
rattling change in my pocket

  dad was knocked off his feet
helen went on she was breathing
hard her full breasts rising and fall-
ing under the inadequate confines of
the flowered halter i helped him up
i was sobbing when we left the bunga-
low his car was outside i drove
he sat beside me holding his jaw and
didnt say a word to me about what had
happened he never did until he heard
that your lawyers wanted me to testify
in court he asked me not to men-
tion that scene you see how that
would have started everybody in town
talking and how bad it would have been
for my reputation-my father getting
in a fist fight over me so i didnt
even tell your lawyers about that
party

  did you see lily after that

  of course not you can imagine
how i detested her she sat up and
hugged her knees she deserved what
happened to her

  what she meant was that lily had
deserved what i had done to her i
had no desire to raise the issue it
never got anywhere with anybody

  i said the night lily was killed
you waited at my house for kerry to
return

  i thought it would be only a few
minutes it was more than ai hour
were you in the house all that
time

  for a while but miriam and ursula
left me alone in the living room and it
was stuffy inside so i went out in the
garden to wait for kerry

  did you see or hear ursulas car
leave or return or both it was parked
in the driveway

i was sitting around the side of the
house i couldnt see the driveway

from there i heard a car and thought
it was kerrys and walked as far as the
corner of the house but it was bevis
so i went back to the chair she rested
her chin on her knees and looked curi-
ously up at me  why do you want
to know all about these things you
neednt be sorry that you- quickly
she changed her mind about finishing
it

  im gathering material for a prob-
lem in mathematics i said

  thats over my head what has
mathematics got to do with lily or is
that supposed to be a wisecrack

  i stood looking out to the road it
would be easy to drop it now if i
couldnt face the people of west
amber i could move to another part
of the country i had no ties not even
to my sister when you reached my age

  helen was telling me that she had
beer on ice i shook my head and said
so long and went to my car she stood
up and watched me back the car to
the road i waved she did not move
a hand or smile the last i saw of her
she was still staring after me

rjphere was butter in the car worth
a fortune in ration points and it
was probably goo by now but still i
did not go home i turned off on james
street

  george winkler his meaty hairy
torso stripped to the waist was devot-
ing the saturday afternoon to mowing
his lawn he wiped sweat from his
massive brow and asked how the boy
was

  not bad for a murderer i told
him

   oh cut it out he said disgustedly
why dont you go away somewhere
for a few weeks

  what does magee know about
lilys former husband when kerry
was on the witness stand and men-
the spider lily



tioned that lilys name had been yard
magee repeated the name don yard to
himself

  george rested his bulk on the
handle of the mower observant
cuss arent you don yard is a no-
torious new york gambler a very
tough lad i understand

  and magee knows him

  many people in new york know
don yard or have heard of him the
fact that lily had been married to him
might have been useful at the trial to
undermine her reputation further but
wed only investigated her conduct in
west amber we found enough for
our purpose

  what do you know about a woman
named bertha in connection with
yard  

  that must be bertha kaleman
after the trial magee told me about
yard and mentioned her she is prob-
ably yards mistress

  and hated lily because yard
wanted lily to come back to him i
said she could have come up to
west amber and murdered lily or it
was don yard because lily refused to
go back to him

  my god alec that line of reason-
ing wont leave out anybody who had
ever known her the lass inspired
homicide

  then there are emil schneider and
ogden garback

  the kids out we proved to our
satisfaction that he hadnt gone out
with lily since last winter george
massaged the sweaty hairmatting his
chest alec youre a mathemati-
cian

  i laughed ive been brooding
over the laws of probability

  thats it-probability every time
i see you and talk to you im con-
vinced you didnt do it if you had i
think youd admit it but lets be

  frank its too much to believe that
somebody stabbed her a minute or five
minutes or ten minutes before you
barged in there after events had fallen
in such a way that all evidence inevi-
tably would point to you the odds
against a coincidence like that are too
great suppose i were to bet in a game
that on the next hand i would pull a
pat-hand straight flush what odds
would i ask

  one to 

  i knew it was at least one to fifty
thousand george said and if i
pulled that straight flush after mak-
ing that bet youd call it a coincidence
too far-fetched to be believed in

  id call it a violation of the laws of
chance under the circumstances id
be sure you had stacked the cards
and that if you werent dealing an ac-
complice of yours was

  and who george said softly
would want to stack the cards against
you

  i thrust my hand deep into the poc-
kets of my ducks to hide their trem-
bling youve just made my point
the odds exclude everybody who
wasnt at ursulas house that night
george left the support of the lawn
mower and hitched his belt over his
bulging belly what are you getting
at

  that somebody knew that i was
rushing to lily in a high state of ex-
citement he or she saw an opportun-
ity to murder lily and frame me for
the crime

eorge looked off to his right

     over the tops of the silver birches
i saw the edge of a roof probably
that was the bungalow in which lily
had lived it was about the right dis-
tance and direction

do you know what youre imply-
ing george said turning back to me


mammoth mystery

  i steeled myself to go on i
walked to the bungalow everybody
at the house had a chance to beat me
to it you to begin with you live
only a few steps from the bungalow
and you were home when i passed
this house maybe youd just re-
turned from lilys

  he open his mouth

  im not being personal i cut him
off im trying to set up a hypothesis
kerry nugent admits that he reached
james street before i did bevis
spencer drove his father home he
could have stopped off at lilys be-
fore going back to miriam oliver
spencer could have walked from his
house after bevis dropped him off
its only half a mile and i had two
miles to walk sheriff dowie says he
drove home and then left to drink
beer but he might have gone straight
to lilys instead

  i was under the impression that
mathematics was an exact science
george said with heavy sarcasm

  its good for any kind of straight
thinking i forced myself to be ruth-
less ursula was in the cardroom
miriam lying down in her room helen
spencer around the side of the house
in the garden any of them could
have driven off in ursulas car which
was parked in the driveway gone to
the bungalow and returned in ten min-
utes

  and the human equation

  you mean the motive as you
said who didnt have reason for kill-
ing lily

  i didnt

  thats what you say how do i
know you didnt or kerry didnt or
even dowie didnt i know why the
others hated her

  i hated her too george muttered
looking down with abstract interest at
the blades of the lawn mower be-

  cause of what she did to you he
lifted his shaggy head we started
with poker there is psychology as
well as mathematics in poker and mur-
der do you believe that any of the
people you mentioned would be cap-
able of deliberately framing you
your mathematics means that or it
means nothing

  i was silent

  i know what youre thinking
george went on at any rate im
thinking it the murderer might frame
you to divert suspicion from himself
but look at the risk involved look at
the split-second timing necessary why
not simply walk in on her one night and
kill her and walk out with the reason-
able assurance that her body will not be
found for hours or perhaps days by
that time the trail if any would be
cold too many people had a motive
for the murderer to be suspected in par-
ticular and what if he were sus-
pected there would be no evidence
against him he shook his head
no alec you cant have your killer
an extremely clever and quick-think-
ing individual and at the same time a
complete fool

jje was right of course i had
known it from the first im just
starting to line up terms for my equa-
tion i said weakly

  george snorted nuts to your
mathematics youre not dealing with
the set values of numbers but with
human beings

  i	took my hands out of my pockets
they were clenched and hot im
not finished there are schneider and
yard and bertha kaleman and per-
haps somebody i never heard of
and whats become of your laws of
chance george mocked

  you were the one who suggested
the fantastic odds of a straight flush
the spider lily



why that hand why not the odds on
a pair which are little better than two
to one or even three of a kind
forty-eight to one which is not too im-
probable because look lets say
that lily intended to tell me something
that was dangerous to somebody and
the absolute necessity to kill her didnt
come to a head until i was actually in
town that lets us include schneider
and yard and bertha kaleman and
others my homecoming made her
murder inevitable that night the
killer had to wait for darkness houses
around the bungalow are so close that
there was a risk hed be seen coming or
going by daylight so he had to wait
until nine-thirty or ten when it was
dark enough to shelter him she was
my wife i was bound to visit her that
night in view of that theres nothing
so far-fetched in the fact that i walked
in shortly after the murder

  youre assuming-

  im assuming unknown quantities
until i learn their values

  george winkler studied me alec
youre not out for vengeance you
still dont care for her

probably im conceited but i
dont like to be thought of as a killer
in any case george said the
law has decided that the circum-
stances were extenuating

  to hell with the law

  i went across the lawn to my car
and drove home

chapter x
negotiation or a name

t left the house through the back
door when i heard some of the
poker players at the front door ur-
sula had asked me to go easy on using
the car because she was short on gas
coupons but i didnt intend to drive

far

  the telephone directory said that
emil schneider lived on ivy lane
there was a mailbox with his name on
it but it was lined up with eight or
ten others at the head of the road at
the first house mr rosenberg was
watering his lawn i stopped the car
and asked him where schneider lived

 mr rosenberg peered at me
through the deepening twilight then
turned off the water at the nozzle and
came to the car his son had been one
of my close friends alec linn he
said recognizing me

  i heard dave was killed in ger-
many i said it was a great shock

  yes the man had aged a great
deal well alec im glad you came
through all right

  i felt a flash of resentment that was
always with me now before i realized
that he meant the war and not the
trial

  which house is schneiders i
asked again

  youre going to visit emil schnei-
der there was incredulity in his
voice he knew about schneider and
lily of course everybody did since
the trial

  why not i said pugnaciously

  mr rosenberg gave me a long sol-
emn stare then he said turn up
the second driveway on the right and
go as far as you can

  all i saw when i came to the end of
the second driveway was a shed gar-
age i had to get out of the car be-
fore i spotted the house a couple of
hundred feet away that was the
closest you could drive to it from
there you walked up wooden steps
with flimsy birch rails and weaved
along a flagstone path through elabo-
rate rock gardens and patches of
sloping lawn the schneiders must
have just come from a big city when
mammoth mystery

they built this house we small-town
folk like to drive up to our front doors

  when i reached the porch i looked
back i knew all the chaotic odds and
ends of roads and lanes in west am-
ber james street and ivy lane ran
more or less parallel and from here it
was a short walk down the driveway
across ivy lane and along a footpath
through the woods to the back of
george winklers house on james
street which meant also approxi-
mately to the back of the bungalow in
which lily had lived and died

j rang the bell there was no an-
swer but there was light in a sec-
ond floor window so i kept my finger
on the button light went on in the
downstairs hall emil schneider
opened the door

  linn he said and took a back-
ward step as if afraid i would hit him
he was in his underwear shirt and his
long loose body was thinner than i
had thought his mustache was no
longer streamlined and stubble de-
prived his face of its normal sleekness

  i want to talk to you i said

  what about he asked nervously

  dont be afraid you werent the
only one who made love to lily i
need your help

  for what

  to find out who murdered her

 he stood in the doorway looking at
me speculatively come in he said

  i followed him into the living room
dust was an inch thick on the fur-
niture ashtrays overflowed and the
table was piled with old newspapers
this was a house in which there was
no woman and the man had stopped
caring about it

  schneider ducked out of the room
and returned with a bottle of whiskey
and two glasses i shook my head he
ignored the glasses and took a long

pull directly from the bottle then he
smacked his lips and said you were
acquitted what difference does it
make to you who murdered her

  so you know i didnt murder her
  whats that

  everybody else assumes that i did
why dont you

  schneider put down the bottle eyed
it longingly decided not to and sat
down i take your word for it he
said

  i walked to his chair and stood over
him fighting to keep my voice low and
my hands steady you know i didnt
kill her because you did

  oh hell he said wearily
havent i been kicked around
enough without you trying it
youve been kicked around

  all right both of us he seemed
about to burst into tears do you
know what i was doing when you rang
the bell i was upstairs packing my
clothes im taking the seven-twelve
train out of this damn town in the
morning and never coming back yes-
terday i had divorce papers slapped on
me eventually my wife would have
forgotten and forgiven and would have
come back to me with the children
but somebody sent her newspaper
clippings of the trial and that finished
me with her her lawyer who served
the papers also told me to get out of
this house when i built it eight years
ago i had a judgment against me and
put the house in her name so legally
its all hers on top of that i was fired
from my job those sanctimonious
stuffed shirts at the bank dont want a
teller who was forced to admit in pub-
lic that he was making love to a mar-
ried woman if i had more guts id
put a bullet in my head

jf he hadnt had such an abundance
of pity for himself i might have
the spider lily



pitied him a little i knew what lily
could do to a man and even now that
she was dead she was not finished

  then why not tell me the truth
i said

  what truth

  whatever - it is i cant see you
running to the district attorney when
you heard lily was murdered and tell-
ing him you had speken to her on the
phone why stick your neck out
why put yourself in a position where
your affair with lily would probably
be made public it would have been
smarter to have sat light and not have
mentioned that phone call at all

  his attempt at laughter was be-
tween a sob and a giggle i learned
what a mistake it is to be a public-
spirited citizen

  you chose the lesser of the two
evils i said you did phone lily
that night but the truth doesnt end
there she didnt know that i was
back she asked you to see her that
night or consented to your coming
over you left for her bungalow at once
it took you less than five minutes to
walk through the woods what you
did when you got there you know bet-
ter than anybody else then you re-
called that there are no private phones
in this area any of the other seven
parties on your line could have over-
heard you making the date with lily
if you didnt come forward to tell
about that phone call somebody else
might and it would look a lot better for
you if you did it yourself

  and if anybody had heard me
make a date to go there here would
i have stood

  not worse off the testimony of
an eavesdropper and a gossip would not
be worth much if you got in your ver-
sion first

  he studied a red and green pattern
in the rug at his feet so i went to

 lilys that night eh

  nothing else explains the way you
 acted

  schneider rose for another slug of
 whiskey he watched me as he drank
 and the speculative gleam appeared
 again in his eyes when he put down
 the faottfe he said how important is
 it to you to know who murdered lily
 very important

  he nodded slowly as if in agree-
 ment with himself i told you my
 wife gets the house about every cent
 i have is in it-or every cent i thought
 i had i played the stock market last
 winter and took a licking tomorrow
 morning im going to chicago where i
 have a brother wholl help me find a
 job but i need money to keep me go-
 ing until then

  my stomach turned in disgust
what do you want to sell me

  the name of the murderer

  it wasnt you

  his laughter jarred my nerves im
 not kidding i need money bacly and
 i have what you want

  how much

  five thousand dollars

  what do i get for it

  a name

  in other words nothing but i had
 less than nothing now

   will you go to the district attorney
 with me i asked

  he was back in the chair and had
 resumed his inspection of the rug
 absolutely not

  what can i do with just a name
 thats up to you whether you
 buy or not im leaving on the seven-
 twelve train tomorrow morning

 tlve thousand dollars was thirty-
 five hundred more than i had to my
 name but i could somehow get my
 hands on the rest if i had to

  how do i know the name is the
o

mammoth mystery

 right one i said you might pluck
 it out of the air

  he shrugged without looking at me
its not easy for me to do this you
wont believe me but before i met lily
i was a pretty decent sort of guy ill
take your money but i wont lie to
you

  unless the right name is yours
and thats why youre running away
what proof can you give me that
youre playing straight with me

  i can tell you how i know who
murdered her

  i walked over to the whiskey bot-
tle but kept my hand from reaching
for it all right tell me

  schneider leaned forward from his
hips the rug absorbing his attention
youre right about the phone call and
why i told hackett about it since my
wife left me ive known that some-
body has been listening in on my
phone conversations especially on in-
coming calls when they picked up the
phone in the hope that it would be
lily ive no idea who it is likely
some busybody gossiping old woman
so lily and i always pretended we
were talking about houses she wras in-
terested in buying like when we
spoke at ten oclock that night i didnt
phone her she phoned me i guess
she was bored and wanted one fling
with me before you came back im
not sure she just said she wanted to
discuss the house wed looked at a
couple of weeks ago and i knew what
she meant and said id be right over
i was so eager i didnt even stop to
put on a hat

   he lifted his eyes and the bitterness
in them startled me damn her to
hell both of us ought to be glad
shes dead i dont know how you
feel linn but im not glad thats
why i damn her he shook himself
youre right i cut through the woods

to her bungalow i approached from
the back i saw somebody come out
through the back door there was
something queer about the way that
person went to the road going to the
trees a short distance away and keep-
ing in their shadow all the way then
i lost sight of -- he hesitated - the
person the car must have been
parked a way down the road headed
toward town because half a minute
later i heard a motor start and a car
leave

  a car dashed by me at the head of
james street

  it could have been that car you
must have been pretty close at that
time though i left before you got
there i was puzzled by the way that
person had acted i went in through
the back door and across the kitchen
and into the living room i saw lily
on the floor i bent over her and she
was dead then i beat it

  why didnt you ball the police
  did you

  i was too stunned to think of it
i said

  i was stunned too but not enough
to lose my head look at what hap-
pened to you because the sheriff found
you there with the body dont you
think i would have got that treatment
if it had been me instead my wife
had left me because of lily and now
lily was giving me the brush-off be-
cause you were coming home what
better motive could the district at-
torney ask for i ducked out of there
as fast as i could and kept going un-
til i was home

j wasnt much of a drinker but
now i couldnt resist schneiders
whiskey i filled one of the two
glasses some of the liquor slopped
over my chin the place had become
a hothouse
the spider lily



  was it a man or woman i asked
putting down the glass

he shook his head you have all
the free information im giving you
did you recognize the person
there wouldnt be any point to this
if i hadnt light from the house
flowed on the person when the per-
son came out through the back door
do you know don yard and ber-
tha kaleman

  last spring i spent a weekend in
new york and lily met me there
that was why my wife left me some-
body saw me with lily and told her
this town is full of nosey scandal-
hungry- his mouth twisted any-
way lily and i went to a nightclub
a squat very broad man came to our
table and said hello to lily he didnt
once glance at me after a minute he
went back to his table where a hot-
looking redhead was waiting for him
lily told me that he was don yard
her former husband and that the red-
head was his current mistress bertha
kaleman

  would you have recognized either
don yard or bertha kaleman months
later seeing them for only a moment
i would have he said but its no
use fishing for information i told
you enough to show you that i know
more five thousand dollars will get
you the sex and the name

  i could tell the district attorney
what you just told me

  schneider snorted he was looking
at me more often now he was gain-
ing confidence getting the feel of the
business enterprise ill say you
lied

  the name wont do me any good
unless you back it up

  i couldnt if i wanted to i cant
prove i saw anybody all ill get out
of it is a perjury charge against me
for having lied on the witness stand

bring that five thousand dollars cash
before midnight and the name is
yours

  cash i said how can i raise
that much money at night if you
wait till the bank opens on mon-
day-

  im leaving at seven-twelve tomor-
row morning with or without the
money i dont trust you not to stop
a check after i tell you the name
thats why it has to be cash you have
lots of rich friends in town your sis-
ter always keeps some cash in the
house she cashed a four hundred dol-
lar check at the bank last thursday
then theres oliver spencer theres
no night depository at the bank so he
keeps the saturday receipts in a wall
safe at home until monday morning
thats generally around two thousand
dollars most of it in cash

  but five thousand dollars

  you can scrape the rest up else-
where thats your problem he
took another look at the rug design
and added indifferently take it or
leave it

  how would i figure his hand in a
poker game hed be the eager kind
in a bluff a super-salesman if he had
nothing of value but he wasnt play-
ing it that way he didnt seem great-
ly interested in the pot

  ill see what i can do i said

  he nodded vaguely as if he had
stopped caring one way or the other
he had gone down a long way from
the solid citizen the family man and
home-owner i used to see in the bank
cage lily had done that to him he
had sunk down among the worms but
there was enough man left in him to
give himself an out that part of him
preferred that i turn his offer down
and save what was left of his soul

  i decided to call him except that
      continued on page 
why was it that no one
wanted it known just whom
the rutherford girl had killed

b

larry

holden

he looked like one of those
men of distinction you see in
the whiskey ads but he was
worried and it showed around his eyes
and in the creases that ran from his
nose to the comers of his mouth even
if it didnt show in his voice that
has something to do with breeding and
background im told i wouldnt
know

  mr keogh he said in a flat voice
i have reason to believe my daughter
killed a man last night you were rec-
ommended to me by an associate as re-
sourceful and discreet and i want you
to-

  i stood and reached for my hat

no i said

  i tell you-

  i shook my head i said no and
im getting out of here before you tell
the sest of it because youll only be
sorry you spilled it and youll get to
worrying what im do about it aril i
think you have enough on your mind

and that goes for me too in 

  i started for the door but he
me again he was a whale of
slapper

  mr keogh he said harshly if
my daughter has committed a crime i
shall be the first to insist she stand
trial for it i will not attempt to hide
it from the police i will not  

  he went on for quite a while in this
civic-minded strain but it drew me
back to the chair bide the desk even
if i wasnt convinced

  you know mr rutherford i said
when he ran down  this wouldnt sound
so much like the speech you gave the
kiwanis boys last week if you had
called the police before you got me in
maybe iiq fat and forty and look
dumb but im saleit-proof why didnt
you call the police

  because man im not sure i
merely said i had reason-

  okay okay avhod she shoot

mammoth mystery

  where did it happen

  i dont know

  wow i maybe you know how or
why it happened

  no

  brother i said you dont want
a detective you want a crystal gazer
didnt she spill anything

  my daughter is in no condition to
talk she was hysterical when she
came in at five this morning and the
doctor i summoned said she is tem-
porarily deranged because of shock
he had a tight rein on himself but it
was too tight and his hands were be-
ginning to shake but there was blood
on her dress-and not her own blood-
and there was a fired revolver in her
purse thats all i know

  he closed his eyes and his hands lay
limply on the desk before him i felt
sorry for him but not too sorry be-
cause i didnt trust him i still thought
he was trying to get me to pull back the
neck his daughter didnt have sense
enough not to stick out

  and where do i come in i asked
just to be talking

  he took a deep breath somewhere
perhaps a man is lying dead with six
bullets in him i want you to find that
man before the police do

  and then

  i want you to protect my daughters
interests

  i stood up again and this time put
my hat on ah hell i said maybe
you didnt hear me the first time

  but he went right on talking in a
monotone as if i hadnt spoken at all
i want you to find anything that can
be used in her defense if she goes to
trial i want you to get there first be-
cause the police wont be interested in
defending a-a murderer and they will
overlook the things that may save her
life

t took my hat off again it was an
  old hat and could stand it

  why are you so sure theyll con-
nect her with it at all i asked

  because she went out last night
wearing a sable cape and returned with-
out it

  and if it hadnt been for the cape
would you stilt have called me

  you could have cut throats with the
look he gave me but he didnt answer
we were finished playing games and
now it was take it or leave it so i took
it

  im going to soak you for this i
gave it to him straight ill cost you
five grand win lose or draw in ad-
vance-and i still dont like it
cash or check he snapped
cash

  he unlocked the top drawer of his
desk and counted out five bills from
an envelope i didnt hold them up to
the light

  and now he said in that frigidaire
voice of his i think weve wasted
enough time

  right lets take a look at that
dress and the gun

  theyre upstairs in my room as
my eyebrows went up he added sharp-
ly i didnt want the doctor to see
them damn it

  as we stepped into the hall a young
man who looked like the sort of son
men of distinction usually have came
clattering down the stairs whistling a
little blues song he couldnt have been
very blue for he greeted his father with
a big lopsided grin

hi dad he said sorry about
rolling in stinko at six ayem it must
have been that wild oat i ate last night
thats all right son youd better
get your breakfast

  the kid made a face and put his
hand to his stomach but he clattered on
by and turned into a room that could
start with a corpse



have been a kitchen

  is he wise i asked

  he knows nothing about it ive
postponed telling him until  i
didnt want to upset him hes in
charge of the purchasing department
there was a strong note of pride in his
voice as you probably know i con-
trol the north american distilling
company

  yeah i said i looked you up be-
fore i came

  he went the rest of the way to his
room and he opened a closet and
dragged out a white evening gown that
was cut simply enough not to have cost
more than two or three hundred right
down the front was a big brown smear
as if someone had tried to grab her and
had slid off he unwrapped a cheap
nickel-plated  from a handkerchief
and handed it to me still in the hand-
kerchief

  somebody got it all right i said
you cant fire all six unless you fire
straight up in the air and that blood
didnt come from a bird lets see her
purse

  he handed me a little jewelled thing
that must have been a bargain at tif-
fanys and i emptied it on the bed

  among the usual woman stuff was a
blue poker chip and seventeen nickels
i picked up the chip it had a scotch
terrier embossed in the center of it

  thats her lucky piece he said
she always carries it i dont see-
why is it her lucky piece

  she won rather a large amount of
money gambling one night she kept
the chip out of her winnings
where

  i dont know where doss one
usually gamble at a gambling house
i suppose he didnt sound like a
loving father he just sounded bitter

  i let it pass and said heres a funny
thing a girl doesnt deck herself in

all these pretties just to go for a walk
all alone in the park who was the
guy

  carroll dennis controller at the
distillery he didnt come home with
her he was not at home when i called
why would she want to shoot him
that seemed to surprise him shoot
him good god man they were en-
gaged to be married

  there are worse motives

  he said good god man a couple
more times but the idea seemed to
shake him up while he was getting
used to it i picked up a pair of white
satin evening dippers and gave them
a going over inside and out aside
from a green smear that peeled right
off there was nothing except an i
miller label and i couldnt hold that
against them

jphe scream came with the intensity
of a calliope i was bending over
putting the shoes back on the floor
and gave my head a ringing crack
against the mahogany highboy but old
man rutherford seemed to know all
about it for he turned and galloped
down the hall like an arthritic stork

  i was right behind him when he
pranced into the room at the head of
the stairs

  if deranged meant screwy his
daughter had it she looked nutty
enough to feed a family of squirrels
a rawboned nurse was struggling to get
her back to bed but wasnt getting very
far because the girls not having any
clothes on didnt make her any easier
to handle but suddenly she stopped
writhing and with graceful movements
of her arms began to sing come to me
my melancholy baby cuddle up and
dont be blue all your fears  she
hung on fears for a quavering instant
before her face snapped into a mask of
pure terror she wrenched herself


mammoth mystery

away from the nurse and leaped under
the covers and lay there trembling so
hard you could hear it then she
passed out the nurse breathing hard
arranged her comfortably on the pil-
lows

  i stepped quickly to the bed and
looked her arms over for pinpricks
there was one on the right arm high
up that the doctor must have given
her but i didnt have time for much
more for rutherford grabbed me by
the shoulder and butted and pushed me
across the room

  you leave your hands off her he
shouted furiously he looked as if
he were going to hit me but most of
that was because i had barged in and
saw his daughter naked

  i dont like being pushed around so
i gave it to him as rough as i could
ive seen hopheads act like that and
i wanted to be sure

  that cured the parental ire hop-
heads he gasped

  then the nurse lit into me and yelled
if i didnt know the difference between
a poor girl who was suffering from
shock at least she did and so did the
doctor and rutherford started waving
his fingers under my nose so i said
nuts lets get on the phone i got
some calls

  he followed me downstairs still yap-
ping his head off but i paid no atten-
tion i scooped up the phone and
started calling all the cab companies in
the book because if she came home by
taxi maybe they could tell us where
they picked her up and that would be
something to go on i didnt expect to
get very far and i didnt they had to
check with their night drivers so i
said id call them back i had ruther-
ford try to get carroll dennis again
but there was no answer he looked
discouraged

  were not getting anywhere he

said desperately im paying  

  yeah and youll get your moneys
worth before were finished whered
they go last night

  they went to dinner i dont know
where

  whered they usually go

  he shook his head helplessly and
made a few motions with his hands

  so i said okay did they have
anything to say before they left that
might be a hint

  he wrestled with that for awhile and
at last got it down she came into the
room and said heil hitler im strict-
ly from hunger but i know a coal pile
where we can really stoke up he
looked anxiously at me is that any
help

  his eyes kept going to his wrist
watch and he kept trying not to look

  there aint no such place i told
him not these days wait a minute
i take that back the smorgasbord
place out on the highway the stock-
holm or something like that and its
close enough

  ill get my car

  i said no im going alone

  a stubborn look came in his face
and he said quietly im going with
you

tm kind of pig-headed and i might
have argued it out but young ruth-
erford stuck his head in the doorway
and said hi dad- im leaving now
can i drive you anywhere

  rutherford said well   and
looked at me

  i shrugged well drive down and
get my jalopy he can take us

  he took us we didnt say much on
the way

  the old man broke the silence once
and said mildly you should call tom-
my and tell him why you werent at
the apartment last night
start with a corpse



  i told him last evening dad i
wanted to talk to you about that ship-
ment of rum were taking in today
i called you last night but you werent
in now heres what i wanted-
later son

  and that was all young rutherford
whistled his little blues tune and if id
had my zither i would have accompa-
nied him i hate rides with three in a
roadster unless the fourth is blonde
and on my lap

  as we got out at my garage ruther-
ford said in mild reproof you should
have your car cleaned son its like
a sandpit underfoot

  young rutherford flashed his grin
today dad a promise ill be up
for dinner tonight right

  yes son very affectionate

  and that should show vou what in-
teresting people you meet in my pro-
fession

  we drew a bullseye at the stock-
holm i gave them a quick flash of my
badge that didnt say police and they
were very helpful yes miss ruther-
ford had been in last night they
knew her very well they were glad to
say was there any trouble they
were glad there wasnt yes of course
the waiter hed be free in a moment
if the gentlemen wouldnt mind   
too glad to be of assistance too glad

  the waiter was swedish and sounded
it but youll have to use your imagina-
tion because im no good in the dia-
lects he stood up very straight with
his hands at the seams of his pants and
made his report in that sing-song the
swedes have

  miss rutherford and her escort had
table three they first had smorgas-
bord then the young lady ordered
frog legs with  

  thats the cooks department
whatd they talk about

  i did not overhear sir the young

lady was very gay but the young man
was sad he did not smile there
was not much conversation during din-
ner just before they left she seemed
to be urging the young man to go some-
where with her she said heads we
do tails we dont then she tossed
something in the air like a coin and
said heads

  i pulled out the blue chip it was
the same on both sides

  was this what she tossed i asked
and flipped it like a coin for him with
people like that you have to keep it
simple

  he stood stiffly at attention and
watched it he didnt bat an eyelash
i couldnt say sir he said after he
had given it all the attention he seemed
to think i expected i wasnt watch-
ing very closely is that all sir
thats all sergeant ill recom-
mend you for promotion at reveille
he turned on his heel and marched
out he didnt salute

  i stopped in the phone booth in the
lobby and called the cab companies
again four of them hadnt carried
miss rutherford last night but would
be glad to do so in the future and guar-
anteed fast prompt service the others
hadnt contacted their night drivers
and where could they contact me

  ill contact you i said thanks
i made for the car and rutherford
stuck to me like tar to a fender

  well chase down that blue chip i
told him its a cinch thats what she
was flipping so it must have been on
her mind she wouldnt toss her com-
pact and it wasnt any of the seventeen
nickels or the waiter would have said
so why seventeen

rjhere were a lot of roll-em-and-
weep joints along the highway but
all of them didnt go in for the kind of
swank that went with blue chips and


mammoth mystery

ladies in sable wraps four that i knew
of between here and trenton-the mid-
way the coq dor the black and
white and mcmahons of course it
might not have been any of these but
it sounded reasonable and i couldnt
see anyone driving thirty miles to the
city just to watch a little man rake in
your dough when the wheel stopped
not tfith the gas shortage

  we hit the midway first and bellied
up to the bar for a rye apiece the
barkeep was bored and sloppy and
didnt seem to care if he hit the glasses
or not

  rutherfords eyes snapped but be-
fore he could open his mouth i said
quickly quiet this time of day

  the barkeep said yeah chaser
while he fumbled around with the
glasses a white cat jumped up on the
stool beside me looked into my face
and said quack then it said quack
again i looked at the barkeep and he
was grinning

  everybody jumps when she says
that he was friendly now its
her throat shes been like that ever
since she tangled with the fox terrier
down the way she wants you to buy
her a fish theyre a dime

  i spun a dime on the bar and he
came up with a fish a little bigger than
a minnow he saw the way i looked

  it aint every day you can buy a fish
for a quacking cat he said defensive-
ly then he grinned its the bosss
idea but its still a riffle hell for a
dime she ought to lay an egg too

  we finished our drinks and i tossed
the blue chip on the bar he picked
it up and looked at both sides then
looked at me

  whats that for

a blue chip worth ten bucks
not to me it aint ours have a
monogram and you cant spend them
over the bai the drinks are a buck

  now if you had had a sears roebuck
badge and a dick tracy education you
could have done better than that but
im fat and forty and try to get by the
easy way and sometimes i get care-
less like with the chip i should have
known right away a joint called the
black and white would have a scotch
terrier on their chips and i should have
known after the way he acted the bar-
keepd call them up with a tip-off
maybe ive lived too long
even in cash

fyte skipped the coq dor and
went straight to the black and
white but they were waiting for us-
a committee of two the barkeep
wasnt behind the bar when we walked
in he was at the end talking to a tall
thin man with a face you could use to
peel potatoes they jumped us when
we walked past the barkeep handed
me one on the side the head then
while i was still groggy he grabbed me
by the back of the neck and rush me
toward the open door just before he
heaved i reached back for his wrist and
rolled foreward he dived straight over
my head and took up a couple feet of
the oystershell driveway with his face
i let him have a couple high on the
cheek as he scrambled to his feet then
kicked his legs from under him and put
a rabbit on the back of his neck that
laid him down for good

  i sprinted back into the bar but i
could have saved my legs for the old
man was doing all right skinny was
backed into the corner of the bar and
the wall and was holding his wrist and
howling and trying to duck each time
rutherford jabbed at him with his
fountain pen i pushed the old man
aside and slammed the guy in the belly
then put everything i had right on the
button his head hit the wall like a
tom-tom and he slid down and sat on
start with a corpse



the floor with his head on his chest
he was strictly a punk i reached down
and jerked the pen point out of his
wrist and handed it back to ruther-
ford

  heres your nib pop i said you
ought to go home

  he shook his head stubbornly so i
gave him the phone numbers of the cab
companies and told him to call up again

  i dragged the barkeep back into the
room and sloshed him with water his
face looked like what happens to your
leg when you slide into third base i
slapped him a few times and he came
around

  look i said maybe you needed
the exercise but otherwise i dont get
it

  nuts to you snoop he said

  he gingerly patted his face with the
towel i handed him from the bar and
looked at the blood is if he didnt be-
lieve it

  pal i told him i dont know
what your angle is but were looking
for the old guys daughter he thinks
she eloped but he aint sure and he
doesnt want to call up missing persons
if shes going to turn up with orange
blossoms from hoboken because the
newspapersll go haw haw and hes a big
executive and lost his sense of humor
when he was promoted now if you
still want to box just get up and well
go a few more rounds

  he said crisake and went behind
the bar and poured tvo drinks whatd
she look like he asked

  tall blonde white evening dress
sable cape a knockout 

  he kept nodding as i spoke yeah
yeah yeah he said but i didnt see
her when she first come in she didnt
show at the bar till late shed picked
up a couple cs on the wheel and must
have been celebrating inside because
she had a heluva bag on she was with

two guys and kept calling one of them
fred which wasnt his name it looked
like she was supposed to know this oth-
er guy not fred but she didnt and
the guys got a laugh out of that then
she started yelling for clams but we
dont serve sea fish but this other guy
the one without a name said he knew
a place and they went out and if you
could have seen them carry her out
she wasnt doing no eloipng shes in
some guys apartment sleeping k off

  seems as if whatd these two guys
look like

  hell guys in a tuxedo look alike to
me dames dress different its like
a uniform the guys

j didnt get my hunch until old
man rutherford came back from
the phone with that funnv look on his
face and said there was nothing doing
from the cab companies it was like
turning a corner and meeting a friend
i threw the whisky down and didnt
even taste it

  thanks pal i said to the barkeep
and grabbed rutherfords arm and hus-
tled him out

  a hundred yards down the highway
i swung the jalopy into the old shore
road and opened it up about a half
hour in i took the north prong of the
fork and kept the pedal down this
stretch when it hit the shore was pret-
ty desolate since the hurricane cleaned
out most of the summer shacks but
there was a little joint out there hardly
bigger than a dog wagon that used to
get quite a play from the sea food lov-
ers the new highway had turned that
trade south

  the joint was still there but it had
that barren look an unlived-in place
gets i cleaned a peep-hole on the win-
dow and peered in there was a lot
of dust but there was a tiny bar with
some plates on it and a half empty


mammoth mystery

whiskey bottle and on the shelf behind
it in front of the mirror was another
bottle of whiskey a small keg and a
telephone in the left corner was a
juke box it looked screwy but i
knew i was right

  the seventeen nickels i said

  i turned away from the window and
started trotting down the road that led
to what used to be a fishing village
the fishermens shacks had gone with
the wind and the big weighing-in house
was all that was left for a road to a
deserted village this one had a lot of
tire marks and a lot of them from
heavy trucks

  the old man was doing his best to
keep up with me but i was running
pretty hard because i wanted to get it
over

  if the body hadnt been there i ac-
tually would have been disappointed
but it was lying on its face close to the
water and beyond it in the dry sand
was something that looked like a dog
stretched out and sleeping i turned
the corpse over he had taken one of
the six shots through the hand as if he
had put his arm up to protect himself
the other five were in the face and
chest and it wasn a picture id want
to carry around in a locket i heard a
stifled gasp behind me and looked up
into the old mans ashy face

  its dennis he moaned his chest
jerked a couple of times he was going
to be sick

  take a look at it i said sav-
agely take a damn good look

  i strode over to the sable cape that
looked like a dog and as i bent over
something went slap and i dived for
the sand it went slap slap again and
i guess the only thing that saved me
was that the guy was shooting downhill
from the dunes and i was lying flat
but the old man was standing and at
the next slap he twisted around and

fell i had mine out by this time and
sent a few quick ones at the rim of the
dunes that must have sounded danger-
ous for after a few minutes i heard a
car roaring away but fast by the time
i had floundered to the top of the dunes
there was nothing there but a road that
curved out of sight almost immediately
in the scrub pine

  i ran back to the old man he had
got it in the shoulder but it wasnt too
bad and after i tore up his shirt and
wound it around it stopped bleeding
i helped him up and with a little as-
sistance he could walk

   a drinkll fix you up till we get a
doctor i told him

  i kicked in the flimsy door of the
clam joint and propped him against the
bar before i went around back

  whiskey i said or some of this
stuff in the keg whatever it is some-
thing spanish was burnt into the wood

   its rum and furthermore its smug-
gled there arent any revenue stamps
on it give me some whiskey

t got the cops on the phone and told

  them about the body and the old
man being shot and i was taking him
home i put down the phone slowly
they had told me someone had just
called up about the body this case
was beginning to stink

  they were at the house when we got
there and so was young rutherford
for his car was parked at the side it
was dinner time and later than i
thought they were all in the big liv-
ing room that overlooked the garden
the two detectives were talking to-
gether at the window and young ruth-
erford was leafing through a magazine
whistling his little blues song he
looked up and grinned

   thats a pretty tune i said lets
see it goes come to me my melan-
choly baby cuddle up and dont be


start with a corpse



blue i heard your sister sing it this
morning now what could there be
about a little tune like that thatd scare
the pants off her

  he stopped turning pages and his
grin froze

  and what about that body at the
shore and the seaweed on her white
shoe and all that sand in your car to-
day-the car she drove home and you
had to come by taxi-the old man
jumped when i said that -and pre-
tend you were drunk just so you could
explain your car being here or did you
want to keep an eye on her just in case
she hadnt been too drunk to see you
shoot dennis how did you feel when
she escaped in your car and left you
stranded you planned that for her
didnt you

  he was trying to sneer but his face
wouldnt stay put because the muscles
were making movements of their own
i gave it to him as hard as i could be-
fore he could get himself together

  itll be easy to prove i said well
just get her finger prints from the
wheel and call in the cabbie who drove
you up and dennis got his because
he started asking pointed questions
about the smuggled rum you were sell-
ing to the distillerys bottling plant
there must have been some pretty fun-
ny looking indorsements on those
checks that came back from non-exist-
ent companies and to an auditor that
must have been as suspicious as hell
you kept your smuggled rum in that
weighing house in the old fishing village
didnt you itll be easy to prove any-
way there must hatffe been a nice
piece of change in that for you-the
difference between what you paid for
it and what the distillery paid because
theres no tax on smuggled rum

  while were getting the prints from
your car well look up those checks and

let you explain them and well get
the barkeep from the black and white
to identify you as the guy who wasnt
fred

  boy youre a dilly you tried to
frame your sister for murder and tried
to cut down your old man and me at
the shore and all in twenty-four hours
    lookout

  i sprang for the desk he had a gun
under the magazine and the bullets
ripped up the floor the barrage that
followed came from the two dicks at
the window and they tore him to pieces
for there was a hell of a lot of blood-
all he had it looked but the madhouse
didnt stop there

  the shots started her off again and
there was one shriek after another from
upstairs then a scramble on the stairs
and she came charging into the room
still stark naked her eyes rolled up in
her head her hair flying she must have
been as blind as a bat for she ran
smack into the wall and knocked her-
self out one of the dicks gladly helped
the nurse roll her up in a blanket and
carry her out

  i turned to the old man and said
well theres your five grand worth
but tell me something when you
found out from the cab company it was
your son they carried what were you
going to do-let your daughter fry or
just have her stuck in the nut house as
a homicidal maniac

  he worked his mouth like a goldfish
took a tottering step toward me and
reeled and fell across a chair and slid
to the floor i looked at the other dick
and he shook his head and made a face

  i put on my hat and walked out of
the house i stood for a minute on the
porch and took a good deep breath of
the clean fresh air as if i had never
tasted anything like it before

the end
    hatred caused reece to send his rival a
gift to be worn next to the heart but he

forgot to say whose heart   

cleverly placed floodlights sil-
houetted the girls slim body
through the filmy robe draped
in graceful folds about her without
the ultra modern bathroom background
she might have been some shy nymph
poised beside a pool in a hidden forest
glade

  hold it now reece said with
quiet urgency from where he stood be-
side the big camera he watched her
tensely conscious that the shutter re-
lease bulb was dangerously slippery in
his hand it was stiflingly hot in the
studio and reece had already taken
three shots of the girl rearranging the
lights and setting each time in the ef-
fort to be certain that he got one picture
which would be exactly right

  leila nesbitt held the pose though
with an evidence of strain fortunately
concealed by the shadows which
showed that she had still to gain the
statue-like immobility necessary in a

professional photographers model
reece hesitated a moment in the act
of squeezing the shutter release bulb
looking at her he felt the strange
feeling of aching tightness well up into
his throat hed taken pictures of
scores of beautiful women but be
couldnt recall having felt this way be-
fore this was the first time any girl
had ever been more than a common
object of photographic composition a
mere problem in lights and shadows
and he was afraid afraid because what
he felt was so new and rare he could
not bear the thought of disappointment

  reece swallowed hard and pressed
the bulb thats all he told leila

   the girl slipped at once into the com-
parative darkness to one side of the
softly floodlighted bathroom scene and
began quickly to pull on a more sub-
stantial robe reece was careful not
to watch her he busied himself with
the camera sharply aware of the small

mammoti mystery

rustling sounds she made

  he liked her shyness her natural
unspoiled modesty it was this even
more than her refreshing vivacious
beauty which had attracted him for it
had set her apart from the women he
knew photographers models usually
become quite unconcerned and base af-
ter a time about displaying their physi-
cal charms and in this respect reece
found leila different she was a new-
comer to the modelling game he had
met her a little over a month before
a short time after she had arrived in the
city looking for work fascinated at
once by the novelty of her reserve
reece had hired her and all too soon
he had found himself thinking in terms
of wedding rings and apartments for
two

  do you think the pictures will turn
out all right floyd leila asked anxi-
ously as reece turned off the flood-
lights she was barefooted looking
almost child-like in the long green robe
her chestnut hair the hue of polished
mahogany had been piled atop her
small head for the picture and now she
began deftly to rearrange it searching
reeces face questioningly

  reece flashed her a grin of reassur-
ance dont worry leila with you
in them the pictures are certain to be
perfect

  i didnt mean that leila said
quickly her delicate features reddening
i was thinking about mr kendall
you know how important these pictures
are to him

id eece glanced at the girl sharply
feeling a sudden wrench of dismay
he wondered why she should be so
concerned about jerry kendall could
it be that she was interested in him
reece went cold at the thought he
had not considered kendall as a rival
but now the possibility came to him

with the shock of an electric current

  he said slowly the pictures are
important to me too leila jerry ken-
dall and i are running this advertising
agency on a partnership basis with
jerry taking care of the business end
while i handle the art work were
both in the same boat naturally im
hoping the pictures turn out well get-
ting that contract from the dahlia cos-
metic company would establish us
among the big firms and bring in more
business

  leila smiled ruefully you look too
much like an artist floyd i keep for-
getting that youre a businessman
too

  unintentionally the girl had touched
reece in a sensitive spot to hide the
sudden bitterness which twisted his
face he turned quickly to a nearby ta-
ble and picked up the photographic
plates which he had just exposed he
resented his appearance-a resentment
which had grown entirely out of his as-
sociation with kendall short and thin
and with a sedentary pallor reece was
all too aware that he cut a poor figure
beside kendall who was tall and ath-
letic he did not like to have the con-
trast referred to no matter how indi-
rectly and coming from leila the hurt
was especially keen

  are you going to develop the pic-
tures yourself floyd leila asked
indicating the plates

  forcing an expression of calmness
reece nodded thii is a rush job and
with everything depending on the re-
sults i wouldnt care to trust any of
the assistants with them

  im going to get dressed then leila
said she smiled at reece and started
toward the dressing room adjoining the
studio

  oh just a minute leila reece
called

  yes she turned back to him
close to my heart



questioningly

  i  i hope you wont think im
rushing matters but id like to know if
i could take you out again tonight
im sorry floyd mr kendall has
already asked me

  reece had an abruptly sick feeling
jerry you    youre going out
with jerry

  leila stared at reece wonderingly
as though frightened by what she saw
in his face she turned quickly away

  for some seconds reece stood there
as though in a daze finally he roused
himself into motion started leadenly
toward the darkroom he walked as
though through the shards of broken
hopes he knew that there was no
longer any hope for him if jerry ken-
dall were interested in leila his envy
of kendall suddenly became cold re-
lentless hatred

  in the darkroom going mechanically
through the process of developing the
plates reece found himself toying with
the though of murder if kendall were
out of the way he would have a clear
field where leila was concerned and
the agency would belong to him en-
tirely kendall had organized and ad-
vanced it to the point where reece felt
he could easily carry on

  but the stumbling block in kendalls
elimination was how to do it safely
reece knew he had to avoid suspicion
not only from the olice but from leila
also especially from leila since the
girl had already guessed his feelings
with vengeful determination reece be-
gan to ponder ways and means

jerry kendall was in his office
talking to leila when reece en-
tered with the finished prints ken-
dall rose eagerly to his feet how
did the pictures turn out loyd
reece had already decided on the
attitude he would assume for the dura-

tion of his relations with kendall -
relations to be terminated as soon as a
fool-proof plan for murder presented
itself he would be completely friend-
ly and ingratiating as though nothing
at all were going to happen now he
grinned with an expression of exag-
gerated boasting and waved a hand of
which the thumb and forefinger formed
a circle the remaining three fingers
stiffly erect

  kendall seized the pictures impa-
tiently and spread them out on his
desk he and leila scrutinized them
with exclamations of delight

  theyre great kendall said you
did a swell job floyd as soon as the
copy is ready well ship the layout to
the dahlia cosmetics people the pic-
tures alone are sure to win us the con-
tract

  sliding the pictures together ken-
dall placed them carefully in his desk
this calls for a celebration get your
coat on floyd and well all go down-
stairs for a few drinks

  right with you reece assented
lightly he was relieved to see leilas
face clear up at his ready acceptance of
the invitation he knew she had dis-
missed as unimportant his chagrin ear-
lier at the news that she was going out
with kendall soon she would forget
about it entirely thus when kendall
died she would have no reason to sus-
pect reece

  slipping into his coat reece rejoined
leila and kendall and together they
rode the elevator down to the combina-
tion restaurant and cocktail lounge on
the main floor of the building ken-
dalls elation at the certainty of the 
deal with the cosmetic company filled
him with small-boy mischief he
pointed at reece teasingly

  look at that coat leila have you
ever seen anything like it why its
stuffed more full of junk than a kids


mammoth mystery

pockets floyd is a regular perambu-
lating junk shop

  reece chuckled good - naturally
though inwardly he ached with rage
going through trash cans is an old
habit of mine he returned easily i
manage to pick up a few things here and
there every little bit helps business
being the way it is

  kendall and leila laughed apprecia-
tively leila said sobering

  ive often noticed the way your
pockets bulge floyd just what do you
carry in them anyway

  photographic equipment mostly
a miniature camera spare film photo-
meters reference books and things like
that good pictures are all around you
and it pays to be prepared

  kendall slapped reeces back
thats the proper attitude floyd but
going around in a coat with so many
suspicious bulges i should think youd
scare the pictures away

  reece choked back his anger keep-
ing the smile fixed rigidly on his face
he was painfully aware that kendall
was making him look like a fool-and
in front of leila his determination to
kill kendall became a thing of burning
intensity

   in the cocktail lounge they found a
table and ordered drinks kendall ex-
uberantly proposed a toast

  heres to dahlia cosmetics may
their lipstick never smear and their
mascara never run

rjhey laughed and drank kendall
began to discuss plans for expan-
sion of the agency as if the dahlia cos-
metic contract was a foregone conclu-
sion reece forced a pretense of inter-
est fuming as he noticed how leila
hung on kendalls every word

  reece was pleased when dominick
vallo appeared beside the table the
presence of the moody italian art

dealer would serve excellently to divert
leilas attention from kendall

  ah my friends how are you
vallo greeted effusively he seemed to
have had a few drinks too many as
always his expensively tailored suit was
wrinkled and mussed his great shock
of curly black hair streaked with white
stood on end as though from repeated
nervous combing with his fingers he
had sad liquid eyes and a long melan-
choly face

  reece knew vallo quite well as did
kendall also since vallos art gallery
and curio shop was on the same floor
as the agency offices leila had already
met him having been introduced by
reece a few weeks before

  at reeces gesture of invitation
vallo pulled up a chair and sat down
he proceeded at once to fix leila with
a devouring gaze

  madonna he exclaimed at last
it cannot be but my eyes they do not
lie each time i look at you signorina
i am reminded of a certain miniature
in my collection

  youve mentioned that before
leila said just what is this certain
miniature youre always talking
about

  vallo leaned toward her confidingly
but watching him reece thought he
detected in the others attitude a strange
hint of contradiction vallos eyes for
some reason seemed to become lidded
guarded as though he were hiding as
much as what he intended to reveal

  the miniature is a little painted
portrait just so big vallo held out a
thumb and a forefinger separated by a
space of some two inches it was
made in venice around the time of the
borgias it is old very old and valu-
able but most important signorina
the face of the girl in the miniature is
almost the same as your own

  vallo leaned forward still further to
close to my heart



the amusement of reece and kendall
and the dismay of leila ah you
must see this miniature signorina i
will show you other things famous
paintings-

  kendall chuckled come up and see
my etchings said the spider to the fly
vallo drew back with an injured ex-
pression what you suggest that i
dominick vallo might have whfat you
call dishonorable intentions it is an
insult vallo promptly forgot his
honor as a bar hostess appeared with a
tray of drinks he buried his long
nose in a glass eagerly when he fi-
nally set it down his mournful expres-
sion had returned

  ah no the vallos have long been
known as men of integrity and virtue
the little signorina would be quite safe
in my hands why    why gladly
would i lay down my life to protect
her there is nothing i would not do
she has only to say the word and i
would gladly end my life vallo
thumped the table and looked at leila
with a kind of mournful determination

  dont believe him kendall told 
the girl dominick tells that to all
the ladies in fact he has quite a repu-
tation around here as a potential sui-
cide the only reason why he isnt dead
already is because he always passes out
from too much bottjed courage before
he can commit the bloody deed

  ah but this time it is different
vallo insisted he seemed determined
that leila should not take his threat
lightly this time i mean it long i
have been in love with the girl in the
miniature and now to find her in the
flesh alive    vallo released a
doleful sigh ah if i were only young
again but signorina perhaps you do
not mind vallo asked leaning sud-
denly toward leila again meglio
tardi che mai better late than never
eh

 she drew back startled then
laughed i think youre very nice mr
vallo but if you dont mind id
rather have a boy friend my age
vallo shook his head bitterly so it
must be il campo santo-the cemetery
-after all

  kendall glanced at his watch and
stood up wed better be going leila
if were to have enough time to climb
into our formals

  she nodded quickly and picked up
her purse and gloves reece seethed
at her evident eagerness he managed
an airy wave of the hand as she and
kendall left reece was almost glad to
have them go if they had remained
another minute he felt as though hed
have burst with the volcanic fury in-
side him

  reece remained for a while at the
table with vallo the mournful-looking
art dealer kept exclaiming at intervals
over the marvel of leilas resemblance
to the lady in the miniature reece
was only dimly aware of what vallo
was sayfhg he was grappling once
more with the problem of his intended
murder of kendall

a week passed the dahlia cos-
metic company approved of the
pictures and layout and the contract
was duly signed reece found himself
suddenly overwhelmed with an influx
of new business he saw little or noth-
ing of leila but from occasional re-
marks dropped by kendall he knew
kendall was seeing the girl fre-
quently-all too frequently

  reeces problem was still unsolved
no safe plan for murder had yet sug-
gested itself and with the element of
time now introduced by the growing
intimacy between kendall and leila
the whole thing was beginning to look
hopeless

  during a lull in his work one after-


mammoth mystery

noon reece seized the opportunity to
visit the cocktail lounge on the main
floor of the building he had in fact
became of late a steady customer

  dominick vallo was seated at one
of the tables staring moodily into the
depths of an old fashioned reece
joined the other and signalled the bar
hostess

  you have heard the news vallo
asked

  reece shook his head what do you
mean

  jerry kendall has not told you

  i havent seen much of him lately-
or of anyone for that matter reece
said bitterly

  the beautiful leila she is going to
marry vallo explained

  reeces heart climbed a mountain
and jumped off marry he gasped

  vallo nodded solemnly jerry was
in a great hurry but he told me this
just a few minutes ago he went up-
stairs to look for you

  i must have gone down just as he
came up reece decided dully ab-
ruptly he stood up i dont want to
see him come on lets go theres
another bar around the corner reece
tossed a bill on the table to pay for the
drinks as yet unarrived and grasping
a reluctant vallo by the arm hastily
left

  in the other taproom reece and
vallo settled down to serious drinking
the alcohol was a key that unlocked
the door of reeces reserve he began
pouring out to vallo the story of his
hopes and frustrations highly emo-
tional by nature vallos usual melan-
choly deepened to a boundless sympa-
thy for reece

  that jerry kendall he is a rat
vallo declared thickly he hunched
toward reece secretively my friend
what you need in this crisis is one of
the little toys the italians like the bor-

gias used long ao clever little gad-
gets-like the miniature

  the miniature reece grunted
whats the miniature got to do with
helping me

  vallo leaned forward closer and his
voice dropped to a hoarse whisper
the miniature was made small to be
worn close to ones heart not your
heart my friend but the heart of your
enemy for inside the miniature is a
device which throws out a poisoned
needle when the heat of the body
melts a little wax stop a nice gift
no your enemy wears it close to his
heart and-phf-j-t no more enemy
something clicked in reeces mind
like the pieces of a long perplexing puz-
zle falling finally together a ray of
cunning penetrated the alchoholic fog
which filled him he told vallo its
impossible i dont believe a word of
it such a thing just cant be done
vallos back became stiffly perpen-
dicular impossible eh well ill
show you the miniature you shall see
for yourself

  all right but youre going to have
a hard time convincing me reece rose
in belligerent acceptance of the others
challenge this wis exactly what he
had been hoping for vallo had played
right into his hands

  the fog inside reece was swiftly
evaporating he glanced at his watch
it was almost evening which meant
that most of the tenants of reeces and
vallos office building would be gone
this suited reece fine since it meant
that there was now little chance of his
running into kendall

nly one elevator operator was now
on duty in the building and
his cage was rising to the upper floors
fuming at reeces irritating disbelief
vallo plunged up the stairs with a
shrug reece followed they met no-
close to my heart



body on the way to their floor the
hall itself was empty

  muttering hotly under his breath
vallo fumblingly fitted his key in the
lock and led the way into his shop
from a drawer of the old-fashioned
roll-top desk in his office he pulled a
small flat metal box

  here it is he announced trium-
phantly now i shall show you
vallo opened the box and into the palm
of his hand shook a tiny framed paint-
ing which looked curiously thick
handle it carefully he warned as
reece impulsively reached for it the
last owner of the miniature kept poison
on the needle and it is still deadly

  reece gazed at the miniature with
fascinated interest the painting was
of a young girl the resemblance to
leila seemed slight at first but strange-
ly the longer reece looked at the paint-
ing the closer the similarity became
he realized finally that the alikeness
was due more to spiritual than physical
characteristics the girl in the minia-
ture had the same quality of demure
shyness as leila

  but where is the needle reece
asked vallo

  it is inside the other explained
he pointed to a barely discernible spot
on the surface of the painting see
she wears a red dress this is red wax
covering the hole where the needle
comes out it is hard to tell the differ-
ence no

  reece nodded slowly his thoughts
scurrying like hungry mice you
wouldnt know it was there unless you
looked for it reece abrtiptly grasped
vallos arm and his eyes narrowed
listen dominick you agreed that
kendall played us a dirty trick by tak-
ing leila away from us like that are
we going to let him get away with it
no we wont ill tell you what well
do well send him the miniature for

a wedding present-tell him to wear it
close to his heart theres our revenge
dominick hows that

  madonna no vallo snatched the
miniature from reeces hand the lit-
tle leila she knows she will tell the
police who sent the miniature i will
go to jail

  thats right of course reece
muttered he bit his lip frowning
thoughtfully in his mind the complet-
ed puzzle shifted rearranged itself
clicked into place exultation coursed
through him like the glow of vintage
wine his plans had changed a little
but now they were perfect-utterly
foolproof he was goiig to murder ken-
dall-and get away with it beyond any
slightest suspicion from either leila
or the police

  reece had earlier noticed a brace of
antique duelling pistols on the wall over
vallos desk now he pointed to them
pretending a sudden interest

  say dominick do those old guns
work

  work certainly they are gen-
uine these and not just for show
vallo placed the miniature on his desk
and took down one of the pistols

  reece drew back in mock alarm
careful with that thing dominick
dont worry it is not loaded
but can you load it dominick
sure i have powder and shot in
the case that goes with the pistols i
know the method

  lets load it then reese suggest-
ed in sudden eagerness

  vallo shook his head dubiously it
is too much trouble	

  come on dominick well have
some fun

  no it would be just a waste

  reece gauged the others state of
inebriety carefully he decided to try
a ruse which had worked successfully
once before


mammoth mystery

  i dont believe that gun will work
dominick youre just trying to im-
press me

     before vallo bit his dark
eyes lighted with indignation
again you refuse to believe he ac-
cused all right all right i shall load
it you shall see for yourself he
sat down at the desk removing from
one of the drawers a large leather-
covered case it was lined with red
velvet inside there were depressions
for the pistols and compartments
which held powder shot and wadding
with quick though unsteady hands
vallo loaded the weapon when he had
finished vallo extended the pistol with
a flourish to reece

  there now it is loaded he
carelessly indicated an old leather
couch across the room which was cov-
ered with pillows go ahead prove
it for me i have loaded the gun so
that there will not be much noise
with a smile of anticipated triumph
vallo produced a half-filled bottle of
whiskey from the desk and drank deep-
ly putting the bottle down he swiv-
eled in his chair to watch the couch

  reeces lips thinned in a hard grin
he placed the muzzle of the pistol
against vallos right temple and before
th other could realize what was going
to happen he pulled the trigger there
was a dull muffled roar vallo slumped
limply in the chair

  reece felt as though on fire with ela-
tion the set-up was beautiful-just
beautiful in his minds eye he could
visualize just the way it would look to
the police to everyone grief-stricken
at the news that leila was going to be
married vallo had committed suicide
the art dealers brooding melancholy
temperament and the numerous threats
which he had made to kill himself
would support the theory

  this however was just a part of
reeces plan he chuckled with satis-
faction as he rounded out the rest of it
forging vallos hand-writing he in-
tended to send the miniature to ken-
dall with the explanation that it was a
wedding present and the sentimental
request that kendall wear it close to
his heart the job of forgery need not
be done with exactness since any no-
ticeable differences would be explained
on the basis that the writing had been
done while vallo was drunk

  since the miniature bore a resem-
blance to leila kendall would carry it
around as a keepsake the needle
would do its lethal work-and reece
would have a clear road both with lei-
la and the agency with nobody the
wiser kendalls death would be ac-
cepted as due to an act of revenge on
the part of vallo

  reece got to work wiping the pistol
clean of his fingerprints he placed it in
vallos hand then he assembled all
the necessary materials-pen ink
twine writing and wrapping paper and
various records from which to copy
vallos handwriting he first wrapped
the miniature carefully and addressed
it to kendall that done he wrote a
short note explaining the miniature as
a wedding gift and adding the request
that kendall wear it close to his heart
with stamps he found in one of the
desk drawers reece finally had the
package and note ready for mailing

  he departed by way of the stairs
leaving the lobby of the building only
when he was sure he would not be
noticed the package and its accom-
panying note he dropped in a mailbox
on the corner

jhat night-and for a good part of
the next morning-reece celebrat-
ed what he felt certain was the com-
plete solution of his problems how
close to my heart



he managed to reich his apartment
afterward was a mystery which he
couldnt explain when he awoke it
was early afternoon feeling too sick
to go down to the agency he remained
in bed

  on his way to work the following
day reece collided with the mailman
his bus was due to arrive within a few
minutes and he was anxious not to
miss it

  a registered for you the mailman
called out as reece muttered hasty
apologies and started once more for the
door

  it was a thick envelope reece signed
hurriedly and dashed for the bus stop
his coat pockets were filled as usual
after a futile search for space reece
stuffed the envelope into the pocket of
his shirt

  at the agency reece found matters
proceeding as though nothing had hap-
pened the vallo part of his plan had
gone through without complications
as he had learned from a garrulous ele-
vator operator vallos body had been
discovered by an assistant and the
police had dismissed the art dealers
death as suicide-just as reece had
intended they should

  the only remaining uncertainty was
kendall something which gave reece
hope was the significant fact that ken-
dall was not in his office reece knew
kendall was always the first person to
arrive at the downtown agency in the
morning

  entering his own office reece found
a letter on his desk he tensed with
sudden alarm as he refbgnized ken-
dalls handwriting reece tore the let-
ter open quickly his thoughts spinning
in wondering anxiety

 dear floyd

    wrote you two letters sending
  one to the agency and one to yonr
  apartment so there wouldnt be
  any delay was called out of town
  on business which ill explain fully
  when i get back that dahlia
  cosmetics deal has been bringing
  in customers

     vallo sent me as a wedding pres-
  ent that miniature he was always
  talking about im not keeping it
  as it isnt me leilas going to rhar-
  ry but a fellow shed been engaged
  to and quarreled with which was
  why she came to the city the guy
  came after her and they made up

  i was in a hurry that afternoon-
  this business had popped up-and
  vallo must have misunderstood
  me

    i know how you felt about lei-
  la and so im sending you the
  miniature im not sentimental
  enough-

  there were just a few lines more but
reece abruptly stopped reading with
a thrill of unutterable horror he re-
called the registered envelope which
had arrived as he was hurrying from
his apartment the bulky envelope
which he had stuffed-of all places-
in his shirt pocket    over his heart

  fear flashing and roaring inside him
reece frantically reached to tear the
envelope away he was too late he
knew it as he felt a sudden sharp pain
over his heart-in his heart he tried
to scream in terror and frustation but
the poison acted before he could get
his paralyzed throat muscles to oper-
ate blackness closed in around him-
the ultimate blackness of death

buy victory bonds

i want it distinctly understood
that i have nothing whatever to do
with the gi protective bureau a
lot of people have been asking ques-
tions just because i happen to know
a couple of the guys that run it i
know how the whole thing started and
to prove i am not involved in any way
ill tell it just the way they told it to me

these guys-benny swartz and her-
bie peters-get an idea chicago could

do with a little more law and order

  they have pretty good reasons for
thinking that theyre not back in
town two days when burglars rob po-
lice headquarters of  the next
day some thief steals all the buns out
of the police cafeteria and right after
that thugs snatch the mayors limou-
sine for a get-away car apparently
after shooting down one of buck
clancys smartest contact boys buck

i 

v mm tiemam			--

dayton

the boys wanted only
to help the police solve
crimes and all the police wanted
was to get hold of the boys-for murder



mammoth mystery

clancy as everybody in chiaago knows
is the under cover boss for a lot of
profitable rackets

  this says benny firmly has gone
far enough its time something was
done about crooks disregarding the code
this way

  which code asks herbie

  the code for cops and robbers
says benny chicago has long been
an outstanding example for playing that
game according to the rules and it is
strictly not according to hoyle for
crooks to pick on the police department
-even for a joke

  i dont think these guys were jok-
ing says herbie but is it any of
our business we got problems of our
own figuring out what kind of work
were gonna do now that were civilians
again i dont think mr milligan is
gonna pay our bills in this high class
dump forever even if he is a million-
aire and mug milligans old man just
because were pals of mugs is no rea-
son why his old man should be willing
to support all three of usj and further-
more-

  you dont get it says benny fold-
ing up the newspaper and slapping it
down on the breakfast tray its psy-
psychology herbie wrinkles up
his face and looks baffled then i
sure dont get it all i know is mr
milligan says for us to get busy and
figure out a project that all three of us
can work on you and me and mug
milligan in my book that means we
got to start earnin our own living right
away not only you and me but even
his own son-

  sure sure says benny standing
up and surveying himself in a mirrored
door he is a small wiry guy with
shrewd black eyes and a sharp nose
he is attired at the moment in black
and yellow striped pajamas and a

bright cerise robe he nods at himself
like he is satisfied and pulls a cigarette
out of his pocket psychology he
says works in all directions all you
got to do is take advantage of it and
youre promotin a sure thing
promotin snorts herbie easing
his big frame out of a delicate pink and
gold chair youre always promotin
i may not be smart about psychology
but i got sense enough to know this
old mr milligan didnt get to be a mil-
lionaire by lettin other guys promote
him for this and that

  sure not agrees benny he got
what he wanted by lettin other guys
promote what they wanted its com-
plicated but just take our case for an
example we get acquainted with mug
milligan out at that rehabilitation cen-
ter in arizona that was no accident
the head doc rigged it up because he
was worried about mug milligan the
surgeons have patched up the burned
places and given mug an artificial foot
but he is still full of depression even
if he has got a swell home and a mil-
lionaire father in chicago so the doc
looks around for somebody thats worse
off than mug in one way or another
and he picks on us which is smart
were not in such bad shape physically
as mug is all you got is a bum leg
from shell fragments and all i got is
wheezy lungs from a chest wound but
were not depressed even if we dont
have no homes to go back to and not
very good prospects of being able to
handle our pre-war jobs now do you
begin to get it thats psychology
yeah okay says herbie trying
hard so thats why you were handin
mug all that sob stuff about us bein
happy to be goin back to chicago and
sittin on the corner of randolph and
clark sellin apples you even had me
believin it

  now you got it says benny and
law and disorder



it worked too pretty soon mug started
worrying about us instead of his de-
pression and then he begun to figure
maybe he better do something about it
so thats how it happens we were all
shipped back to chicago together and
thats why mugs lather tells us to get
busy right away on a project mug is
supposed to think hes helping us earn
our living and were supposed to think
we got to work like hell to make good
so mug wont lose interest and take
away his fathers financial backing

  yeah okay says herbie looking
somevhat enlightened now all we
got to do is figure out a project thats
suited to a former sales promoter a for-
mer truck driver and a former mil-
lionaire playboy thats all we got to
do

  get dressed says benny sliding
out of his brilliant robe and placing it
carefully on a hanger we got a proj-
ect what chicago needs most right
now is more protection from crooks
were gonna open a modern bureau of
crime prevention all the latest up-to-
date methods in the investigation and
solution of illegal acts perpetrated
against the person property and peace
of mind of the citizens of chicago

  oh says herbie stepping into the
shower a detective agency

jpen days later benny is promoting
a little publicity by feeding bill
faris a de luxe lunch at the palmer
house ill is a reporter with the chi-
cago sun and he listens politely while
demolishing a rare and costly steak

  you got to admit its a wonderful
set-up says benny enthusiastically
with president matthew milligan
supplying the contacts for our socially
prominent clientele and secretary her-
bert peters handling the strong arm
tactics and myself treasurer benja-
min swartz doing the brain work the

gi protective bureau is bound to be a
success

  i dont see how you can miss
agrees bill with his mouth full with
old patrick milligan backing you

  that says benny is a minor de-
tail in fact id be willing to lay you
ten to one that mr milligan cleans up
on his investment within a years time
id like to have you meet my partners
and take a look around our suite of
offices thatll give you a better idea
of the fine contribution we are making
to law and order in the city of chi-
cago

  thoroughly satisfied and somewhat
mellowed bill faris allows himself to
be conducted to the field building
where benny proudly opens the door to
a modernistic layout straight from
hollywood the reception room is
bathed in a soft light from concealed
fixtures the deep taupe carpet and
twilight blue walls are accented with
enlarged pictures of scarlet poppies and
make a perfect background for the
curvaceous bleached blond furniture
but the curvaceous bleached blonde re-
ceptionist ruins the picture she is ly-
ing on the taupe carpet beside her
curved desk with an ugly bullet hole
between her eyes and scarlet streams
outlining her features

  benny stands there paralyzed with
shock until bill faris shoves him out
of the way and closes the door he
steps noiselessly across the carpet and
crouches to feel the blondes limp wrist
he puts it down quick and back away
again staring hard at benny

  i didnt expect anything like this
says benny weakly

  there is nothing says bill faris
flatly like a good home-grown murder
to start off a new detective agency
where are those fine successful partners
of yours

  benny starts coming back to life and


mammoth mystery

leads the way to the inner offices there
is a carpeted hall with four private
rooms opening off that three doors
are lettered with the names of the firms
three officers the fourth is the library
and consultation room all are brightly
new and unoccupied

  thats funny benny mumbles i
dont know why they should go out
when they knew i was bringing you up
here-

  its very unfunny says bill reach-
ing for the phone as you are about
to find out

hey wait a minute benny
moves quick and snatches the phone
away what are you trying to do
phone the police you dizzy dope
this is murder

  sure sure says benny talking
fast its murder and you discov-
ered it and youre a reporter right
you got a scoop you gonna give it
away before we even find out any of the
details you gonna hand it to the other
papers and let some smart boy on an-
other sheet solve it lets take a few
minutes and use our heads maybe we
can wrap it all up before we give it to
the cops betty smith was a blonde
incendiary could be she touched off
one too many boy friends all we got
to do is find out who she knew and-
that i already know declares bill
harshly what im curious about is
how you happened to hire her she has
been buck clancys private secretary
for three years you know who buck
clancy is

  hell yes benny looks astonished
hes been a big racket boss around
chicago as long as i can remember-
twenty years anyway

  twenty years or more says bill
suddenly thoughtful he lasted be-
cause he kept his operations fairly
clean as many times as he has been
investigated he has yet to be indicted

a smart operator and he had a damn
smart secretary whatever she was
doing in your office i dont think buck
is going to like having her shot he
once told me she was the only one he
could depend on for business details-
meaning confidential business so how
come she was working in your office
who hired her and why

  thats easy says benny easing
the phone out of sight we ran an ad
and interviewed the applicants this
betty smith stood out like a house afire
she had looks brains manners and
plenty of experience though she didnt
mention buck clancy and we never
bothered to check her references
how did you word that ad

  it was very simple says benny
lets see - secretary-receptionist
smart appearance for modern detective
agency milligan swirtz  peters
and the address and phone number
you used your own names

  sure that was last week and we
hadnt decided on the firm name yet
you think the names had something to
do with-

jphere is a scuffling and growling
out in the reception room bentay
and bill faris tiptoe down the hall and
ease the door open a crack then
benny pushes it wide and confronts the
trio of desperate looking characters who
have just jostled each other into the re-
ception room

  big herbie is panting and clutching
a stocky hard-eyed guy whose face has
just recently been worked over it is
red and puffed in spots and one eye is
already beginning to swell around the
edges the stocky guy is swearing with
a kind of helpless rage mug milligan
is not mussed up like the other two but
he has a gun in his hand and looks com-
pletely dangerous the blank sculp-
tured mask of his face is etched with
law and disorder



livid blue scars made deeper by excite-
ment and his light gray eyes look dead-
ly in that unnatural setting

  here-for gods sake snaps bill
coming forward let that man go
what do you think youre-

  get - outa - here says herbie
with ominous emphasis this rat shot
betty we caught him on the fire
stairs mug trailed up after him while
i grabbed an elevator and came down
on him from above herbie shakes
some more swear words out of the
frantic guy i oughta mash him he
adds with thoughtful savagery

  youre crazy yells bill hes a
cop

  all the more reason says herbie
clouting the guy on the ear why i
should mash him the idea of a cop
coming around here and shooting our
secretary i oughta-

  hold it says b-nny sharply if
bill faris says hes a cop then he is a
cop what makes you think he shot
betty

  herbie and his prisoner both start
jabbering at once but mugs deep voice
cuts in and sounds through the din

  there was one shot says mug
herbie and i were each in our own
offices i got here first and i saw at
once that betty was dead the shot
drilled her from the front and shattered
the back of her head i opened the
door to the hallway but there was no
one in sight the door to the fire stairs
is just a few feet away and i got to it
as fast as i could i thought i heard
steps going up herbie came out of
the office just then and itold him to
take an elevator up three or four flights
and come down the stairs while i went
up this fellow was sneaking up the
stairs with his gun drawn he threat-
ened me with the gun just as herbie
came hopping down from above we
got him by surprise and disarmed him

this is his gun if he didnt shoot
betty he must know who did

  bert whats this all about de-
mands bill of the stocky guy whose
face is getting purple

  you think im gonna talk in front
of these crazy baboons snarls bert
get on that phone and call headquar-
ters ill put these guys where they
cant-

  nol says mug as bill moves to-
ward the phone were not turning
this bird loose as easy as that i dont
trust him or you either for that mat-
ter he walks across the room with
only a slight hitch in one foot and opens
a closet door in here with him her-
bie if he yells nobody outside can
hear him

  there is a slight struggle but herbie
damps arms like a champ wrestlers on
the stocky guy and boosts him across
the room and into the supply closet with
a final grunt mug turns the key and
sticks it in his pocket then he looks
down at betty with that blank face

  have you phoned the police yet
he asks benny quietly

  no we just got here says benny
and bill was telling me betty was
buck clancys private secretary by
the way this is bill faris the reporter
i was tellin you about you can put
the gun down hes harmless

  has that gun been fired asks bill
sharply

  its fully loaded now says mug
but he could have taken care of that
on the stairs what do you know about
him

  hes bert scalina just a routine
cop as far as i know hes never done
anything sensational or been mixed up
in any scandals if you fellows will
take my advice youll phone headquar-
ters right now before you get in a bad
jam with the department

  if youre right about that cop says


mammoth mystery

benny were m a jam already a few
minutes one way or the other aint
gonna make much difference herbie
lock the door lets go inside and-

  look im just a reporter says
bill i dont care what you fellows
do but i dont want to be included in

  youre in whether you like it or
not mug informs him coldly if the
police walk in here now well all be
held-you included whether that cop
in the closet is the murderer or not hell
do his best to hang it on us you may
be able to alibi benny but herbie and
i-

  sure sure says benny we got
to protect ourselves and thats what
were in business for - protection
against crime so lets quit futzin
around and get down to business first
off i want to do some phoning and find
out if betty is still supposed to be
workin for buck clancy if she is
then theres a tie-up right there and it
means she was here for no good she
mustve been planted and all we have
to do is find out why and we got the
answer to all this

  of course says bill thoughtfully
i can always say i was intimidated
and it wouldnt be my fault if somebody
took my address book out of my inside
coat pocket and found the telephone
number of buck clancys private of-
fice  

  this is her cousin oscar from os-
kaloosa says benny into his office
phone i just got in town and i got
some fresh corn for her if she aint
there where can i locate her oh
last week where did she go oh
is that right no i hadnt heard about
it gosh thats too bad uh-huh
well thank you kindly

  that says benny putting down
the phone was some dumb little chick
in bucks office she says betty smith
left last week to take a vacation on

account of she was all broken up over
her boy friend her boy friend was
deal bracken hes dead-too

d ill faris snaps a light at his cig-
arette and blows smoke toward the
ceiling not looking at anybody

  so benny continues it shapes up
like this deal bracken was the guy
that got shot a couple weeks ago ac-
cordin to the papers he was about the
smartest contact man buck clancy had
workin for him he got to the right
people at the right time and swung
deals for the clancy combine so he
gets plugged and a few days later his
girl friend takes a vacation and shows
up here to apply for a job and a few
days after that she gets plugged what
did you find mug

  mug pushes a fiat white purse aside
and looks at the conglomeration of stuff
spread out in front of him aside from
her keys he says the only other
things that mean anything are a shop-
ping list that looks a little out of season
and a lawyers card the lawyers of-
fice is in this building but the shopping
list is made up of things a woman would
buy in the middle of winter instead of
the middle of summer

  poor betty sighs herbie now
she wont never find no gold mine
what are you talkin about de-
mands benny

  she had a lotta them little books
like they give out in ticket offices ex-
plains herbie they were all about
alaska and canada with a lotta snow
and dog teams and when i kidded
her about goin to such a cold place she
says its worth it if you hit a gold mine
and then she says forget it shes only
lookin at the pictures to cool off and
she wouldnt think of leavin her swell
job here even if she had enough money
to go as far as alaska

  that sounds says benny like she
meant to make a clean-up and then
law and disorder



start travelin what do you think
bill

  i wouldnt know replies bill laz-
ily im not a travel agency
okay benny snaps him up so
we can phone around to get travel agen-
cies and find out if she made any reser-
vations get the phone book herbie
and start callin just say youre the
police department and if they got no
reservation for betty smith ask what
name have they got with a reservation
to the far north where you goin
mug

  down to consult her lawyer says
mug hitching himself toward the door
a little stiffly ill say shes in trouble
and im her employer that ought to
get some information out of him

  is anybody holding me here in-
quires bill mildly

  yes pipe down says benny 
i was just checking up says bill
settling himself deeper in his chair
whenever you get through holding me
let me know ive got a couple of other
assignments this afternoon

  nothing could pry you out of here
retorts benny not even the fire de-
partment with the joint burning down
where did you write down betty
smiths home phone number i cant
find anything in this damn book i
thought reporters knew something
about the alphabet

  we get tired of it besides her right
name was garman

  you scrounge growls benny
why didnt you say so write that
down herbie the reservations might
be for betty smith or garffian g-a-r


phe shot sounds dull and muffled
from the reception room after one
startled moment benny and bill both
leap for the door and collide with her-
bie butting into them from the rear

when they finally get untangled and
reach the outer room the smoke and
smell of cordite still hangs over the
sprawled figure on the opposite side of
the curved desk from betty the closet
door is wide open and the desk phone
is off its cradle dangling along the side
of the desk

  bert scalina looks stockier than ever
lying there on his back with a bullet
hole between his eyes from which a thin
bright stream is seeping

  benny walks cautiously around the
body picks up the phone receiver gin-
gerly listens a moment and replaces it
carefully

  i think that was police headquar-
ters he says flatly

  the hall door opens and mug steps
in stops and reaches for the gun in his
pocket his eyes are a flat gray as he
stares at bill faris

  we dont know who done it says
benny hastily we were all inside
when it happened he got out of the
closet some way and he was phoning
somebody if it was headquarters-
if it was says mug coldly wed
better get out of here

  thats no good snaps bill you
cant get away with-from this

  no of course not says mug but
if my hunch is right we can do some-
thing about it before the police get here
and delay everything obviously that
cop didnt shoot betty but he knew
who did the killer used the fire stairs
once to get away so hell probably try
it again lets go herbie same tac-
tics benny you go on up higher and
come down from there you mug
jerks his head at bill come with me
you dont have to be afraid ive got
a gun in case we meet anything on the
stairs of course i might use the gun
on you  

  benny eases through the metal fire


mammoth mystery

door on the twenty-third floor and lis-
tens a moment there are no human
sounds coming up from the deep well
of the stairs only the muted echoes
of a giant office building cautiously
he slips down the stairs rounding one
silent landing after another until the
stillness begins to get him and he wants
to yell down at least to find out if her-
bie is there just as he leans over the
railing the shot roars and echoes up
from far below and much closer only
about three flights down there is a wild
scuffling going on

  benny goes down the stairs practi-
cally sliding on his heels and sailing
around the bends on one arm herbie
has a big red-faced guy backed up in
a corner of a landing and he is jabbing
at the guys face with the heel of one
hand while he holds him with the other

  hey yells benny who are you
pokin

  i dont know pants herbie he
was on the stairs and mug said-

  cut it out damn it benny starts
pulling at herbies piston arm some-
body got shot down below we gotta-

  doors bang open and cops start con-
verging on them from above and below
there is much confusion everybody
is indignant especially the cops but
benny and herbie and the red-faced
guy finally wind up back in the offices
of the gi protective bureau where the
homicide squad is worse than indig-
nant according to one wild-eyed ser-
geant the entire personnel of the bu-
reau and all their friends are going to
the electric chair tomorrow

  benny and herbie along with the
red-faced guy are shoved into the con-
sultation room with a uniformed cop

  why benny demands of herbie
did you have to stop and poke this
guy just when the shooting starts
down below why did you pick a fight
with a perfect stranger

  psychology says herbie when
i meet him on the stairs i make off
like im a cop and i ask him if hes got
a gun see if he dont have no gun
then he aint the guy im lookin for
and hell say so but if he has got a
gun hell start worryin thats psy-
chology well this guy dont say aye
yes or no he starts throwin stuff over
the railing

  what kind of stuff

  how do i know i dont get a
chance to see it so i poke him aint
that right

  maybe says benny wearily
maybe not

  the burly red-faced guy sits in a
corner and says nothing

  wheres mug asks herbie and
that newspaper guy

  you tell me mutters benny
gloomily never expecting to see either
of them again

jje is somewhat surprised therefore
when a police captain ushers them
both into the consultation room
neither one shows any signs of bullet
holes mugs face is blank as ever but
bills is convulsed with excitement as
he looks across at the red-faced guy

  hello clancy he says and his
voice isnt as frieidly as it ought to be

  benny sits up and his eyes start snap-
ping and darting around as his mind
turns over at about  rpm

  is that mr clancy says herbie
in surprise cripes if id known
who it was i dont think i woulda
poked him so quick

  pipe down says benny you all
right mug

  im fine says mug in his deep
voice and there is a live ring to it that
wasnt there before that gun ex-
plosion you heard came from the gun
that was dropped over the railing the
safety was off but it didnt do any
law and disorder



damage    except to the killer it
has his prints on it

  sure sure says benny getting in
a quick plug that was nice fast work
on our part nabbing him before he
could get out of the building

  it will take a good deal more than
that to explain your pirt in this says
the police captain angrily the fact
that you did nab him is the only thing
that may save you from indictment
the list of charges isnt complete yet
but weve already got enough against
you-

  i think most of it can be explained
satisfactorily captain says mug
first of all we had no idea that we
might be obstructing justice we had
no way of knowing that you were on
clancys trail or even that you sus-
pected him of murdering his own man
deal bracken therefore we couldnt
know that officer bert scalina was tail-
ing clancy when he came here and of
course scalina told us nothing he was
free and going about his business tele-
phone headquarters in fact when
clancy came on him and shot him we
immediately started the search for
clancy-

  the angry and still wild-eyed ser-
geant comes into the room with a hand-
ful of memos more evidence he
rasps of impersonating a police offi-
cer were getting reports from every
travel agency in town they claim we
phoned for information

  have you got anything asks the
captain

  qancy growls ihe sergeant he
booked reservations for himself and
wife-to california in two weeks he
used his own name bernard x clancy
only he aint got a wife

  the red-faced clancy explodes un-
expectedly with a foul epithet

  if you want to talk go ahead and
talk says the captain

  lawyer   snaps clancy curtly

  so it was the dame says benny
and looks at bill triumphantly i told
you she burned up one too many boy
friends buck clancy falls for her and
knocks off her favorite guy so he can
marry her and take a honeymoon trip
to california

  thats only part of it grins bill
this guy deal bracken was double-
crossing his boss with little bettys
help they planned to dean up and
clear out meanwhile betty was string-
ing buck along with marriage plans as
you say when buck found out about
it he got rid of deal bracken-but
fast since his reservation still stands
he apparently thought he could still
marry betty but she couldnt take
the murder of her lover my idea is
that she didnt dare go to the police
with information about buck that
might lead to his arrest for the murder
she came here in answer to your ad
with the intention of getting you to
solve the murder she was making
plans for a quick getaway so she must
have been afraid buck would try to get
her either before or after she could get
him pinched

  i think says mug that she had
already made her arrangements with
that lawyer downstairs he drew up
a will for her and she left some instruc-
tions about certain payments to be
made he didnt say to whom bat he
hinted that it was to our firm for serv-
ices to be rendered whether she was
still living or not you can he tells
the captain subpoena all tbatstaffif
it will help your case any

dont worry says the captain
harshly we will we will also hold
each of you as material witnesses-
captain im a member of the

  you can write your story in the

were going to hold each and every
one of you until we get these charges
sorted out and applied where they be-
long in all my experience i have never
seen so much interference with proper
processes of law and order and dont
tell me you can explain it because you
cant what possible excuse can any

casanovas prison break

           by wayne harris

it takes little more than the mention of
the name of casanova to conjure up visions
of an artist skilled in love-making a man
who can hand out that line for which the
weaker sex is so gullible is almost always dub-
bed a casanova by his friends what our
modern world is apt to forget is the fact that
the name of casanova belonged to an eighteenth
century adventurer

  that giacomo casanova was regarded as a
criminal in his own times is often forgotten
in july  he was sentenced to five years
imprisonment by the inquisitors of venice in
october  be led in one of the most spec-
tacular escapes of all time in several atheistic
poems he had composed casanova offended the
church and was soon placed under their watch-
ful eye while in venice the inquisitors-the
judicial instrument of the church-took the
pains to employ manuzzi one of their best spies
in an effort to find the evidence to put casanova
into a dungeon when his room was searched
copies of banned literature were found he was
promptly arrested and sentenced to a long term
in prison

  casanovas cell was a tiny garret with a ceil-
ing so low that he could hardly stand in order
to walk about he was forced tv- bend his head
and shoulders since his room was just under
the roof the summer heat was almost unbear-
able once a day the goaler lorenzo came to
visit him he brought food and any other slight
convenience casanova could pay for once in a
while lorenzo took him to a neighboring cell
in which he could exercise by walking in an
upright position

  at first casanova was resignet to this dismal
fate inwardly he believed that he could never
live through his term of imprisonment by
degrees his attitude changed to one of a more
optimistic nature and when during one of his
exercise periods his eyes lit upon a heavy iron
bolt which had been cast into a corner he knew
that an escape might be arranged discreetly
he hid the bolt in his dressing gown and carried
it back to his cell

  this heavy piece of metal was to play a dual
role in the escape of the imprisoned casanova
sharpened it could serve as a chisel a means
of chipping his way to freedom-and would
also be invaluable as a weapon to protect the
life of ks daring owner from unforeseen dangers
for eight long days lie worked in secret to rub
it down to the desired sharpness finally a
point was fashioned at one end eight long
pyramidal facets were made and the bok was
transformed into an octagonal dagger the task
had been a difficult one for casanova was un-
accustomed to any form of physical labor more-
over he had no oil with which to cover the
small piece of marble which served as a rub-
bing stone without oil he could not render it
with satisfactory abrasive powers instead he
had to spit on the stone to moisten it his right
arm became so stiff he could hardly move it
and the palm of his hand was an open wound
these pains were worth enduring because after
a long struggle he had a shining finished
weapon

  as soon as it was completed casanova hid
the dagger from the prying eyes of his keepers
cautiously he placed the weapon in the stuffing
of the back of his armchair-and then he waited
patiently for the opportunity to put it into use

  every day of his imprisonment casanova had
a new set of grumblings with which he plagued
lorenzo the filth he was surrounded with the
dust and the heat of his cell the poor quality
of food the small amount of light and the
lack of books to help pass the time were just
a few of the complaint he uttered daily when
casanovas scheme for escape began to form in
his mind he realized how wrong he had been
to complain

  the room directly below his own served as an
office it was cleaned every morning casanovas
plan consisted of milking a bole through the
floor of his room through this aperture be
would let himself down with the aid of the
sheets from his bed there he would wait until
the door was unlocked to facilitate the cleaning
casanovas prison break



of the room somehow he would make his way
out through the building to ircedom

  this plan was complicated by the fact that
the digging of the hole would require time the
work had to be concealed from the watchful
eye of lorenzo the floor space under the bed
offered the best solution but casanova had
previously complained of fleas and now lorenzo
supervised the thorough daily sweeping of his
room pretending that he had a violent cold
and that the dust of sweeping made him cough
brought results however lorenzo grew sus-
picious after a few days and every corner of
the room was swept out by pricking his finger
and staining a handkerchief with blood casa-
nova was able to convince lorenzo that he had
not told a lie

  the winter nights were conveniently long and
casanova took full advantage of them the hole
under his bed grew larger and larger several
times during that winter casanova was forced
to share his cell with another prisoner his
work had to be abandoned until he was alone
once again two days before he planned to
make his exit to freedom lorenzo came to him
with the joyful news that he was to be trans-
ferred to a more comfortable cell a room with
two large windows through which he could look
over half of venice the goaler was surprised
to notice casanovas reluctance to move in
reality the poor man almost fainted with terror
he was certain his hole would be discovered
trying to hide his true feelings he quietly
changed cells after an hour had elapsed
lorenzo barged into his new cell and threatened
to report him for attempting to escape casanova
remarked that if this was done he would report
lorenzo for having given him the tool the
goaler chose to remain silent

  before long casanova began to plot his escape
once more it was not so easy this time because
lorenzo was more careful daily the walls and
floors of his cell were tapped in a search for
the existence of new holes soon however
lorenzo relaxed the n-le to the extent that
casanova was allowed to exchange books with
his fellow prisoners the count aquinas and a
nobleman known as balbi the prisoners took
full advantage of this privilege and they began
a correspondence in latin in the margin
of the volumes they exchanged casanova pro-
posed that since he was being watched balbi
should have the dagger and ct first one hole
through the ceiling of his cell and then another
down into casanovas room by concealing it
in a large volume casanova was able to put
the weapon in balbis hands after two months
their way to escape was clear on the last day
of october in  they planned to make their
attempt

  at the last moment count aquinas chose to
remain behind but he let casanova have some

of his money to aid the venture balbi and
casanova hacked their way through the old
lead roof but when they saw the full moon
shining brightly down upon them they knew
that several hours must elapse before they
could make the climb on the rooftop

  after waiting until the moon set they tried
once more casanovas efforts were hampered by
the incompetent and blundering balbi but a
separation was impossible they crawled about
on the steep roof for some time before casanova
discovered a small dormer window on a lower
level which could be reached with the rope
of blankets he had wisely thought to bring
with him he was able to lower the unhelpful
balbi so that he could enter the window

  casanovas descent was now complicated by
the fact that there was nothing to which he
could attach the rope after more exploration
he found a ladder while trying to move it
to the dormer window he lost his footing slip-
ped over the edge of the roof and hung over the
street supported solely by his elbows putting
forth his last ounce of energy he was able to
pull himself to safety there he lay for a few
frantic moments trying to regain his sense of
balance and security finally he was able to
jerk the ladder into the correct position and
join balbi

  as trencherous as their position was casanova
could go no further he ignored the frightened
murmurings of his companion and lay down on
the floor to sleep balbi woke him just before
dawn and together with the aid of the trusty
dagger they forced the locks of successive doors
until they found themselves in the vast audience
chamber which was separated from the main
staircase by a gate of massive bronze they
could not continue by their own efforts and were
forced to wait there until daybreak

  with the arrival of morning people began to
move about in the public square below casa-
nova was able to catch the attention of a man
who told the doorkeeper that someone had been
shut up in the palace when the doorkeeper
unlocked the bronze doors casanova and balbi
ran past him and down the staircase before he
could question them the escape from venetian
territory into friendlier lands was managed on
foot and by carriage it was not as easy as
casanova had at first believed but with his
talent for resourcefulness the feat was success-
fully performed he lied borrowed acted and
stole his way to freedom

  for the rest of his life as he wandered from
one country to the next he told and retold this
harrowing tale of his escape at the dining
tables of royalty in france england poland
austria and russia this tale was recited and
in his old age when the dandies of the court
fell into disfavor when casanova was penniless
and unable to borrow more money his story
was penned and published

when my boss lon man-

gotta have a location that
looks like a south sea island i im-
mediately thought of jane morgan
last year id met jane in holly-

wood and wed made the joints together
she was a swell sport and we struck up
a nice friendship when i put her on
the sunset limited for the east coast
she said if youre ever in new york
look up my old man hell know where





mammoth mystery

i am and if you want a location for
one of your sultry pictures of south sea
wenches use the family estate back of
miami

  lons picture was about a marine
flyer that landed on a pacific isle after
his plane conked out i went to new
york and saw mr morgan he said
it was o k to use the place so here i
was in florida

  the location was made to order
palm trees spanish moss palmettos
lush swamp grass and a tropical lake-
everything the boss had ordered

  however instead of finding a de-
serted house and grounds inhabited
only by a lone caretaker i found a lot
of activity interesting activity ill
admit unknown to her old man who
thought she was in aiken for the horse
shows jane had taken a breezer with
three friends and a chaperone to the
florida estate and set up housekeeping
in the mansion for a long week-end
an ideal spot located in a remote sec-
tion off the tamiami trail near the
everglades

  the three friends were bill drake
a handsome fellow just out of leyte
and the army with a jap bullet in his
leg betty williams his fiancee a
blonde with a figure and looks that
would stop traffic at hollywood and
vine and a guy named harrison whom
i did not get to see harrison had
dived into the lake the first day they
got there and cracked his head on the
bottom he had gone back to miami
to get it fixed

  the chaperone was a sweet old lady
named mrs smythe she had a middle-
age spread and grey hair frizzled into
ringlets about her head and she would
go around punching pillows to make
people comfortable when she wasnt in
the kitchen cooking

  the first day was perfect i subbed
for harrison with the cracked head we

danced and had a few drinks and
looked at the moon and took a canoe
ride on the lake

  that night what with the lake
breezes i popped off to sleep like
a baby my room was on the second
story and it faced the lake a long
balcony ran the length of the house a
cool breeze blew across the lawn and
filtered through the big windows at the
foot of my bed it was through those
windows that the gibbering came

  i thought for a moment i was dream-
ing i lay still with my eyes fixed on
the big patch of pinkish blue that was
the changing of moonlight into dawn

  it came again a low throaty in-
sane noise that grew in volume

  i slipped from the bed and flattened
against the wall as a shadow swayed
across the fluttering curtains the
shadow suddenly came into silhouette
and developed into something out of a
horror picture it seemed tall incred-
ibly tall though it stooped grotesquely
and its body was covered with coarse
hair but the head was what started
me talking to myself it was flat and
long covered with scales and swung
from side to side as though set on a
pivot the snout protruded and the
jaws opened and closed with rhythmic
regularity an odor of rotting flesh
swept in through the windows

  as it came into complete view i
dived for my suitcase where i had a
 the thing was carrying a woman
in its arms

  as i got to the window i heard a
thud it had dropped from the bal-
cony with its burden and i could see it
scurrying crab-like across the lawn i
didnt dare aim at it from that distance
for fear of hitting the girl but i blazed
away over its head and saw it drop her
and streak for the heavily wooded
banks of the lake which bordered the
far end of the sloping terrace
death on location



t whipped into a bathrobe
pounded down the stairs and out
across the lawn then i stopped dead
a moment a figure glistening in the
moonlight had risen from the beach of
the lake and was running towards me
i dodged behind a bush and waited un-
til the figure was opposite then i dived
for its legs it was bill drake he
grunted and started to light then recog-
nized me	

  whats all the shooting he de-
manded

  you swimming this time of morning
-before daybreak i asked

  he nodded yeah i couldnt sleep
i was on the beach and thought i heard
shots

  i said some refugee from franken-
stein dragged a girl by my window i
took a pot shot at it and it dropped
her near the lake i had pulled him
back towards the pond there she
is now i added as a form on the grass
became visible in the moonlight

  drake struck a match god its
betty he said

  on the grass her clothes half torn
from her body betty williams lay
whimpering i dropped down beside
her and laid my hand against her throat
a fast pulse pounded shes ok
just out from fright

  drake lifted her and she moaned
everythings all right he said this
is bill

  take her back to the house and give
her a shot of brandy i said im go-
ing to look around for that small edition
of king kong	

  i slipped fresh cartridges into the 
and pushed into the heavy underbrush
where i had seen the monster disappear
a few broken bushes showed where it
had fled but the  rail was soon lost in
the darkness i went on toward the
lake but after half an hour of wander-
ing the ground became so marshy that

it was almost impossible to go further

  i turned back cut sharply to the
right and came to the cottage of mid-
dings the caretaker when i knocked
there was no response however a
light showed through a shaded window
and i tried the door it was unlocked
as i entered i sucked in my breath

  on the floor with lips tightly curled
in a hideous grin of death lay an old
woman her eyes almost protruding
from her head seemed to be fixed
straight on my face i half expected to
hear a scream of insane laughter come
tearing out of that horribly grinning
mouth something had torn away her
throat blood still welled softly from
the ghastly wound into an ever-widen-
ing circle on the worn carpet

  i glanced around the ill-lighted room
and yanked at the  when i spotted
a figure crouched in a corner then i
relaxed it was a girl of about eighteen
a rough gingham dress faded and torn
clung to her body she was barefoot
and her face-beautiful in a savage way
-spoke of stark terror i walked to-
wards her

  what are you doing here i asked
me and maw come over to see
jake the girl stammered

  at five oclock in the morning
no sir we come over last night
we live a ways down the creek when
we started home maw got skeered and
we come back jake let us sleep here
and said hed take the tool house out
back

  i nodded towards the corpse on the
floor was she your mother

  the girl kept her eyes on mine yes
sir likewise that is she aint my real
maw but i been livin with her since i
can remember

  i studied the girl a product of the
swampland beautiful half-savage with
a mass of black hair framing her oval
olive face she was shivering like a


mammoth mystery

high-strung sleeping dog

  wheres jake middings now i
asked

  she lifted well-rounded shoulders
i reckon he went up to the big house
i woke up when somebody was shoot-
ing i thought it was miss morgans
friends hunting possums i must of
gone off to sleep again next thing i
knowed there was that lamp lit and
something awful was a-hanging over
maw it had a gator head i got so
skeered i musta fainted because the
next thing i knowed you was here and
maw was on the floor-

  she started shaking as though on the
verge of hysterics i pulled her to her
feet come on were going to the
house ill call the sheriff and get a
posse here what was your mothers
name

  the girl huddled close to me as we
went through the doorway folks just
called her maw tober im lissa

a the house betty williams was
lying on a couch bill drake sat
beside her an empty glass in his hand
mrs smythe stood by with a bottle of
smelling salts the brandy and salts
had partly restored the girls nerves

  jane morgan ran to me as i entered
she had a touch of her old mans square
stubborn jaw but her face would have
made a movie scout turn handsprings
betty told me what happened she
said did you find anything

  middings the caretaker came in and
interrupted my reply

  miss jane he said the phones
dead i cant get the operator he
turned to me mister did you really
see it

  middings was a typical son of the
soil a large man stooped from a life-
time of hard work and a face lined from
squinting in the florida sun he rubbed
his hands together and i could hear a

whispering rasp from his calloused
palm his voice was a soft-spoken
southern drawl

  i nodded to his question yes i
saw it

  the caretaker backed away and i
saw fear in his eyes oh lawd he
moaned i never believed it till now

  believed what i asked sharply

  ever since the last big wind he
said folks been talking about some-
thing prowling the swamps nights
dogs been bit and tore on dry land
where no gator ever was yet the way
they was chewed up was just like a
gator does maw tober heard some-
thing last night when she left my place
she and lissa was so scared they come
back and spent the night at my shack

  i thought of the pitiful body lying
on the caretakers cabin floor im
driving to ferndale to get the sheriff
i told them i headed for my room
where i changed my pajamas for a
rough jacket and slacks

  it was light as  entered the barn
which served as a garage inside were
three cars-my coupte janes mercedes
roadster and a station wagon

  i swung into the coupe and pushed
the starter the motor whirred but
nothing happened i tried again and
still no response i got out lifted the
hood and found every spark plug
smashed off at the base

  i checked the mercedes next then
the station wagon each had been
sabotaged things were shaping

  i had a tingling down my spine as i
turned to go out of the barn at the
door i ran head-on into a man he
grunted and dropped his pipe i backed
off fingering my gun

jlie was a seedy-looking character

     pig-eyes that were bloodshot a
worn coat of loud plaids and a denim
shirt opened at the throat he reached
death on location



down and picked up his pipe morn-
ing just taking an early stroll through
old man morgans grounds he said

  i looked down at his shoes-and saw
one pants-cuff covered with blood

  the stranger followed my gaze
horse of mine got a wire cut he ex-
plained i was fixing his leg this
morning

  you live nearby i asked

  he nodded yep next estate
names sterling john sterling maw
tober who does my cleaning said some
folks were here i was coming over
later and pay my respects

  come on up to the house i said
my names ferguscn we walked a
hundred yards in silence the name
sterling rang a bell i had seen the
names sterling and morgan on the fi-
nancial sheets of the los angeles pa-
pers the two were big competitors in
wall street

  sterling whipped at the grass with a
crop he carried then chuckled you
been here long enough to see the phan-
tom gator

  i looked at him sharply saw him
grinning but he avoided my gaze still
whipping at the grass

  yes i said it tried to kidnap
one of miss morgan s guests-
sterlings grin vanished he stood
still and gaped at me you kidding
he shrilled

  i told him no and explained what
had happened that morning we walked
on towards the house he kept shak-
ing his head you know theres
been tales going around the natives
about an alligator that waits on its hind
legs and has eyes that flash fire and
that sort of rot-you sure you saw this
thing he was staring at me now

  we had reached the steps of the
house yes i said and im going to
notify the sheriff do you have a car i
can borrow the ones in the barn

have been put out of commission

  sterling shook his head no mines
in miami getting new rings but i can
give you a horse you could make
ferndale in a couple of hours sud-
denly what i had said dawned on him
good god almighty what do you
mean put out of comm- 

  jane morgan came out of the front
door and interrupted his shout i in-
troduced her neighbor and he smiled
with crooked tobacco-stained teeth i
could see she didnt like him as she
turned to me i pulled her aside

  listen i said someone smashed
the plugs in the three cars this fel-
low sterling has offered us a horse so
if its all right with you ill send mid-
dings to ferndale to get the sheriff
things are getting too thick for me to
leave

  she nodded silently and i could see
she was frightened i patted her shoul-
der id better get middings started
i want to pick up this alligators trail
now that its light

  i called middings and he left with
sterling for the latters place to ride for
the sheriff i crossed the wide lawn and
splashed into the marshy ground that
bordered the lake

  dank underbrush slashed my legs
and as i went further into the swamp
the thick growth covered my head
brush slapped at my face and tore my
hands for a moment i had an eerie
feeling that those twigs and branches
swayed as though alive palm trees
rattled their fronds with a noise like
that of giant lizards slithering over a
wall

  a raindrop hit my forehead glanc-
ing up i saw that clouds were gathering
fast and obscuring the sun i hurried
towards the woods at the far end of the
lake reaching them just as the storm
broke

  the rain came down in crashing


mammoth mystery

sheets as i halted by a huge fallen palm
at the edge of the lake it had left a
small cave where its roots had been and
into this i crept the waters of the lake
lapped into the front of the hole but
further back it was drier  crouched
there watching the storm for almost an
hour in spite of my uncomfortable
position the steady pounding of the
rain made me drowsy my eyes had
become fixed on a little pool of water
in the cave the rain made the sur-
face shimmer like silver

  as suddenly as it came the tropical
storm stopped the water of the lake
shivered and became placid the little
pool i had been watching became mir-
ror-clear as i crawled from under the
bank a bright object on the bottom of
the pool caught my eye i rolled up my
sleeve thrust my arm down and picked
up a coin kneeling in the water i ex-
amined it and found it to be an old
spanish gold doubloon

  and then it came again-that insane
gibbering starting low and increasing
in volume until it reached a screaming
crescendo hammering upon my ears
mirrored in the pool was the image of
the monster poised over me its mouth
opening and closing

  i tried to roll and pull my gun but
the monster crashed down and thrust
me into the pool my head smashed
against a stone and the lake and palm
trees seemed to spin there was a
smell of rotting flesh as claw-like hands
closed around my throat then the
water closed over me and i was out

t woke up slowly to a throbbing

  headache i heard a slight rustling
noise and opened my eyes

  feelin better a soft voice drawl-
ed

  i looked up standing over me was
the swamp girl lissa the room was
dimly lit and furnished with rustic

pieces of home-made furniture i was
on a bed and over me were piles of blan-
kets i tried to sit up

  the girl leaned over and put her
hand on my shoulder just be quiet
youre in maws and my cabin here
she handed me a steaming glass of
whiskey toddy

  i drank obediently studying the girl
she had changed from the gingham
dress she had worn when i first saw her
into a pair of jeans and a mans shirt

  i finished the drink and fumbled the
glass to the floor howd i get here
lissa i asked

  i fetched you she answered with a
quick smile found you laying in the
path just outside this cabin with a knot
on your head and you soaking wet
the drink burned pleasantly in my
stomach and the throbbing of my head
subsided my mind skipped back to
the lake the rain and gold coin and the
gibbering thing that smelled of putre-
fied flesh i sniffed and wondered if
the odor there in the cabin was a trick
of imagination no it was there-a
faint elusive smell of the dead

  i shoved the blankets aside and
swung my feet to the floor the girl
had said i was lying on the path outside
the cabin i went to a window and
pushed back the flour-sack curtains
rank undergrowth pushed against the
side of the house

  i turned to lissa how far is it
from the lake

   bout half a mile judging by the
bump on your head i figger you wan-
dered around and happened to end up
here the path leads from the lake
she turned towards the kitchen i
got your jacket drying by the stove
ill get it

  as lissa disappeared through the
door i wondered how she knew i had
come from the lake funny she didnt
ask about the crack on my head she
death on location



was supposed to be at the morgan
house obviously she had come back
to her cabin through the rainstorm be-
cause she had changed clothes i
sniffed again that damned smell of
rotting flesh-

  i glanced about the room dimly
outlined on a packing case at the far
side ticked a battered alarm clock i
walked towards it four oclock it
had been morning when the monster
attacked me i had been unconscious
several hours if that clock was right
i felt dizzy again and rubbed my hand
over my face and massaged my eyes
as the blur disappeared my eyes fo-
cused on the packing case stencilled
on its sides was marine equip
salvage co key west i won-
dered if it had contained parts for a
motor boat then remembered that the
lake boasted of nothing more than a
couple of row boats and three canoes

rjphe entrance of lissa interrupted
my thoughts over one arm she
carried my jacket and in her hand was
another steaming glass as she brushed
through the kitchen door i noticed even
more strongly that stench of death

  from outside came a crackle of the
underbrush the girls eyes widened
and her gaze shot towards the window
the drink she held slopped over and
burned her hand the glass crashed to
the floor she turned madly and dived
into the kitchen slamming the door i
heard a bolt shot into place

  i went to the window and listened
something was coming the brush
snapped and swished but the thick
growth along the path hid whatever it
was from view i picked up my jacket
from where lissa had dropped it and
ran my hand into its pockets for the
gun it was gone

  a heavy iron poker leaned against
the clay fireplace  hefted it flattened

against the wall by the door and waited
there was a footstep on the porch and
the doorknob turned slowly i raised
the poker

  lissa

  it was jane morgans voice

  i pulled the door wide the girls
strained face turned to one of relief
tom thank god i was afraid you
were dead

  i rubbed the welt on my forehead but
said nothing

  janes gaze swept the cabin is
lissa here she left the house shortly
after you did i thought she had gone
to be with her mother at the cabin
lissa came quietly into the room and
leaned against the kitchen door hate
smouldered in her eyes as she glared at
jane if you city folks hadnt come
down here maybe- she stopped
fear again crept into her face

  maybe what i asked

  she became sullen nothing she
murmured

  i turned back to jane did mid-
dings get back with the sheriff

  she shook her head no thats
why im so worried neither he nor
sterling returned im afraid the storm
caught them theres a creek to ford
on the femdale road and it might have
flooded

  i whipped into my jacket things
were clearing i grabbed janes arm
come on were going back to the
house this alligator scare is still on
the loose and theres no telling where
itll strike next besides ive got a bit
of swimming to do before dark

  jane looked at me to see if she had
heard right swimming

  i nodded i would explain later
have you a gun at the house i asked
her as we pushed through the under-
growth

  yes bill drake has one we used
it to shoot at tin cans the first day we


mammoth mystery

got here

  the three of us reached the house
just as it was getting dusk i went to
my room changed into swimming
trunks and came downstairs drake
handed me his gun and started to ask
questions but i brushed him aside it
was getting dark i needed daylight
and every minute counted

  i started at a trot across the acre-
wide lawn then slowed to a cautious
walk as i pushed into the tropical
growth and headed for the deep end of
the lake it was a twenty-minute walk
and it skirted the caretakers cottage
the house was in shadows and the clap-
boards weather-worn-a crypt for the
murdered body of maw tober

at last i reached the lower end
of the lake and stood beside the
fallen palm where i had met the mon-
ster a few short hours before i glanced
around for any sign of life but only an
eerie silence prevailed the sudden
pung of a bull-frog convinced me i
was alone

  the sun was sinking fast but the
water was still clear i could see the
sandy bottom i took a deep breath
and dived straight down

  the depth was deceptive i went
deeper and deeper and my lungs started
aching the lump on my head began
its crazy tattoo into my brain but i
fought my way to the bottom at last
i felt sand against my fingers and
scooped frantically with both hands
hugging the sand close to my chest i
kicked my way to the surface where i
gasped for air then i looked at my
sand there were three gold coins in
it similar to the one i had found during
the storm the bottom of the lake at
that point was covered with the scat-
tered gold of some ancient treasure

  a faint breeze stirred across the lake
and brought to my nostrils the smell of

death dead leaves rustled in the path
above me on the edge of the lake a
gibbering rose and fell i ducked un-
der water and stroked silently to an
overhanging bank directly over the
cave where i had laid a towel weighted
down with the gun was the alligator-
monster its head pivoted wildly its
jaws opening and closing

  i ducked under water again and
kicked my way fifty feet from the cave
slipping out onto the path now al-
most hidden in the darkness i crept on
hands and knees towards the yammer-
ing thing

  suddenly there was a wild scream
from a womans throat i jerked up
and dived for the cave by the waters
edge struggling in the grasp of the mon-
ster was lissa she was fighting against
the claw-like hands that gripped her
throat

  as i went into a flying tackle it saw
me and dropped the girl i landed a
belly-flopper on the towel and gun and
managed to roll upright i held the 
aimed at the belly hold it i said
or youll get blasted

  only an insane scream came from the
creature as it sprang i slammed four
slugs into its belly in mid-air it be-
came limp as it fell and a human
gurgling cough belched from it the
grotesque mask that formed the head
lolled wildly a moment then was still
i jerked it off revealing middings the
caretakers fast-glazing eyes glared at
me in impotent hate as a bubble of
blood showed at the corner of his
mouth he gagged and another belch
brought a gush of blood the stench
of death was sickening

  i turned to the girl who was mak-
ing feeble efforts to get up i raised
her gently are you hurt i asked

  no she said and fainted

  jane and bill drake met us half way
back they had heard the shots and
death on location



started out to find me at the house
we forced brandy down lissas throat
and she came to she stared around
wildly

  is jake dead she whispered

  i nodded

  thank god she said

  you mean you knew middings was
the monster i asked

  yes said lissa you see jake
found a lot of gold it was a spanish
treasure that folks hunted for years
round here itd been buried under a
palm tree which was blowed down dur-
ing the last big wind when the tree
fell it flung most of the gold in the deep
end of the lake jake told me about it
but said hed kill me if i told anybody
he bought a diving suit but the day he
got it miss morgan and her friends
come

  jake went crazy over the gold
swore you all had come down to take it
away from him he rigged up an old
gator head to fit the diving suit and
covered the suit with coon skins said
he was going to scare you away or kill
you all

  i interrupted  lissa have you any
raccoon skins at your cottage

che nodded yes nailed up out-
  side the kitchen

  o k i said go on with your
story now i knew where the stench
came from skins drying in the flor-
ida sun dont smell like attar of roses

  i was afeared jake was going to kill
me after he got the gold said lissa
yesterday he tried to get miss wil-
liams

  betty williams shuddered and
pressed close to drake

  i was afeared you all would get
scared and leave continued lissa so
i busted the spark plugs she looked
up guiltily at me and i grinned back at
her

last night maw and me was over to
jakes and he told maw about the gold
she said he should write mr morgan
that forged the last link so thats
why he killed her i said

  yes said lissa jake got mad
and we left for home but he must of run
ahead and hid he scared maw and me
so that we run back to the cottage he
come in a few minutes later acted like
he wasnt mad and said we could stay
over night this morning he sneaked
in dressed in his gator suit and killed
maw i was afeared to tell on account
of what jake might do to me

  when you started out this morning
i knew jake was going to follow him
going for the sheriff let him out easy
i made like i wanted to be with maw
i followed jake and caught him just as
he was choking you i talked him into
not killing you said it would bring the
law down here and hed never get his
gold so we carried you to my cabin

  tonight when you said you was go-
ing swimming i knew you had got onto
the treasure and i knew if jake caught
you hed kill you for sure so when you
left i sneaked out soon as i could i
got to the lake after jake did he saw
me coming he wouldnt listen to me
said id told on him and about his
treasure then you come along and
shot jake

  the sheriff came in then followed by
john sterling whose head was ban-
daged he explained that middings
had attacked him at his house and left
him for dead hed come to several
hours later and gone after the sheriff

  i told the sheriff the whole story he
rubbed his chin but how did you
discover the gold he asked

  i explained when i found a gold
spanish coin in a hole i had crawled into
out of the rain i thought of the span-
ish treasure story id heard in miami
later at lissas cabin i saw a newly


mammoth mystery

opened box from a marine company
the box suggested a diving suit so i put
two and two together and figured there
must be more coins on the bottom of the
lake and that somebody knew about
them

  when i found out from jane that
middings hadnt returned i decided
he must be the one who knew about it

  i went to the lake dived down and
found the treasure scattered on the

sandy bottom jake showed up in his
alligator rig and attacked lissa i had
to shoot him thats about all

  the sheriff nodded yep i reckon
thats about all except for goin and
gettin jakes body mind taking me
to the spot

  once morei cut through the lush
swamp undergrowth but this time with
the sheriff with me and no fear of things
lurking in the dusk

heres true crime

          by ava brown

crime in the headlines

over  per cent of the people of this coun-
try spend more than one half hour each
day reading the newspapers and yet rarely
do we consider the role that the papers play in
crime the possible influence a newspaper has de-
pends into which category the publication falls
papers like the christian science monitor print
little or no crime news except programs of crime
prevention other conservative papers print rela-
tively brief unsensational accounts of crime a
great number of papers print much crime news
carefully deleting the parts which might offend the
overage standards of good taste and then there
are a few publications which play up crime news
because they believe their readers want sensational
thrills

  the unwise selection of crime news for publi-
cation can have a very detrimental effect on cer-
tain factions of a papers readers it can teach new
techniques of beating the law accounts of insur-
ance swindles have indicated just what error in
method led to their discovery and so warned those
not yet arrested it is further charged that news-
paper accounts have assisted the criminal in avoid-
ing arrest by telling of police efforts to catch up
with him this is usually the result of the police
officials or prosecuting attorneys desire for pub-
licity

  newspapers have preached loudly on the one
hand that crime does not pay while exaggerating
on the other hand the possibility of large profits in
crime in its own peculiar way newspaper pub-
licity can and does give prestige to the criminal
especially the young delinquent who wishes to
parade his daring before his gang

  realizing the grip of the human interest story
on the public mind the papers have often played
it up-disregarding the fact that they are stirring
up sympathy toward some of the most brutal

criminals of their time the newspapers some-
times lay aside their most urgent public duty of
revealing the true facts by concentrating on stir-
ring up an emotion whether toward or away from
crime sometimes newspapers render a very val-
uable service by observing and praising or criti-
cizing the activities of officers of the law

  one of the chief criticisms sociologists and crim-
inologists make against the newspapers has con-
cerned the instituuon known as trial by news-
paper the trial of bruno hauptmann for the
kidnaping and murder of colonel lindberghs
infant son was simply an extreme example of the
indecencies to which some newspapers will stoop
under such circumstances hounding of defense
attorneys for information prejudicial to one side
or the other newspaper predictions of the out-
come of the trial insistence that officials take
sides flashing of photographs in court and out
use of unfair methods to gain admission to court
assigning reporters to live with relatives of the
accused-these have been some of the questionable
methods used in such cases

  newspaper editors are aware of the fact that
they can be a powerful weapon when aimed
against crime and that they carry a terrific burden
of responsibility to the general public recently
the committee on cooperation between the press
radio and bar which represented the american
bar association the american newspaper pub-
lishers association and the american society of
newspaper editors were able to agree on a very
definite program to eliminate many of the abuses
of their profession

detecting forgeries

vou write your name on a check and presto-
a piece of paper turns into money when
this scrap of paper is handed to the bank teller
he looks at your signature ind hands out cash for
the piece of paper-assuming of course that your
heres true crime

ill

account is good if ycu sign your name to a
promissory note you must pay the amount of the
note on the due date it would do you no good
to deny that is your signature because that sig-
nature is exclusively yours and no man can suc-
cessfully duplicate it ves there are experts who
can trace your signature or do a freehand job but
the handwriting expert will have no real difficulty
in proving the forgery the forged signature
might fool a bank teller and it might even fool
you but the expert will spot the forgery every
time the handwriting expert can back his con-
clusions with scientific proof

   but forgery must have existed almost from the
time man learned how to write but in those days
there was no real money in it in the united
states after the introduction of bank clerks the
country was swamped with forged checks today
the number of check forgeries that do occur is
amazingly low the ue of standards of com-
parison was considered taboo in the courts but a
standard of comparison in handwriting which is
genuine may be compared with the suspected
writing common sense indicates that the way
to determine whether a handwriting is genuine is
to compare the questioned writing with the genu-
ine

  handwriting experts are known today as ex-
aminers of questioned documents and no case in-
volving a disputed document would enter the
court today without a recognized handwriting
expert as a witness they must be detectives in
the highest sense of the word

   common crooks do not often attempt forgery
but it has been found that the forgers come from
the upper strata of criminal society

   there are no two things ever alike therefore
 two handwritings cannot be alike they may look
 alike in every respect but actually they are not
 alike

  two methods frequently used by forgers are
the freehand imitation style or they can trace the
writing tracing can be detected by minute traces
of carbon or pencil which was covered over with
the ink or the indentations made by a pointed in-
strument in tracing the very fact that one sig-
nature is identical in fcrm with another is definite
proof of forgery no man can write his signature
twice identically

   the microscope is the number one instrument in
 detecting forgeries unnatural hesitation stroke
 overlaps erasures or traces of ink which have been
 chemically removed may all be seen with the aid
 of the microscope the camera does not always
 disclose the fine tricks of forgery but by means of
 ultra-violet ray the cat is immediately shaken right
 out of the bag

   many people are unaware of the fact that every
 typewriter leaves its ersonal signature on every
 piece of paper that leaves its roller yes no two
 things are alike in thi world the characters on
 the keyboard of a standard typewriter cannot be
 identical with the characters on any other ma-
 chine each machine acquires characterists in the

 act of manufacture so that when it leaves the fac-
 tory it can be identified one letter may strike a
 bit out of line and another may tip over slightly
 some letters may sag print too heavy or too
 lightly or there may even be uneven spacing

  styles in type have changed constantly but
complete records of these changes have been kept
and by these means the make of the model in ques-
tion can be told

  yes photography is a double barreled weapon
first it will catch the criminal then it will convict
him

racial differences in finger
print science

  it was over  years ago that the first study of
racial differences was made by galton he com-
pared finger prints in four small national and
racial groups unlikenesses among races and even
among geographic subdivisions of the same racial
stock are in some cases extreme these unlike-
nesses appear not in the characteristics of the
individual but in the general trends of frequency
of traits which are common to all mankind this
discovery is important

  in india the employment of the fingerprint sys-
tem has not been restricted to the police depart-
ment but has been introduced into all branches of
public business this system is particularly well
suited to the requirements of a country where the
mass of the people are uneducated and where
false personation is an evil

  in the registration offices of all the provinces
of india persons presenting documents for regis-
tration are required to authenticate their signature
or mark by affixing the impression of their left
thumb both on the document and in a register
kept for the purpose

  since april  the fingerprint system has been
adopted by the director-general of the post office
of india in the medical department of the gov-
ernment of india the local medical officer and
the medical board when giving certificates in-
variably take the thumb impression of the person
examined

  it would be tedious to enumerate the many
uses to which the system is being put the intro-
duction of finger impressions in proof or disproof
of identity where the person in question is known
or accessible and has given his mark on a previous
occasion is an extraordinary efficient method of
preventing perjury and personation and is widely
used

  in  the system had been adopted in ireland
and canada and throughout australasia in cey-
lon in south africa where it is utilized not only
for police purposes but also for the registration
of south african natives by the labor pass office
and of the chinese by the foreign labor depart-
ment

  today the criminal finds there is no foxhole into
which he can jump and hope to escape identifica-
tion methods surely ferret him out

derer

  his eyes blazed damn you what

  there were a lot of words in the lan-
guage for him but i didnt use any of

chapter xi
poker

phey were playing two-dollar stud
which was twice the usual limit
that was the art masterson influence
he was a traveling salesman for a
dress jobber and had been a close
friend of august hennessey when-
ever he was within driving distance of
west amber on a saturday night he
came in for a game he was a fat man
who liked to sit whenever possible but
there was nothing relaxed about his
poker he played a vigorous and nerv-
ous game though basically not foolish

  hows the hero he said reaching
out a pudgy hand to me his other
hand waved toward a stranger meet

dietz

  dietz nodded briefly his face was
a cipher with a cigar in it occasion-
ally masterson brought a friend but
never the same one or not a friend
merely a fellow salesman who liked a
good game

  dietz was backing an ace-king to
the limit on the fourth card george
winkler high man with sixes showing
folded bevis spencer and kerry rode
along on nothing apparent master-
son raised his cards showed no sense
to the raise but he was investing to
drive out enough players to increase
his chances if anything came along on
the last turn kerry fled but bevis
clung and dietz merely called then
bevis paired with threes which proved
good enough in view of the fact that
george had folded with his sixes

  you deserve it spencer master-
son told bevis graciously he fin-
gered his chips-two stacks of blues
and one of whites heres your
chance to take some of these away
from me alec

  im not playing i said

  it was bevis deal he sat at the
left of miriam and placed the pack
in front of her to cut she did not see
it she was looking at me she had only
one blue chip left it served her right
for taking a hand in such fast com-
pany kerry sat on her right and then
dietz george winkler oliver spen-
cer ursula masterson there were
two empty seats next to masterson

  come on alec oliver spencer
urged i havent played against you
in years


the spider lily



  he was trying to make peace he
looked at me with a rather anxious
smile i returned it pleasantly to show
him that i didnt bear a grudge because
of what hed said to me in his store that
afternoon

  ive got to leave right away i
said i stopped off to borrow some
money

  ursula rose

  no wait i told her i want to
borrow from all of you i need a lot

  ursula said i have a couple of
hundred in cash

do because the bank is closed tomor-
row

rjphey were all very still watching

anybody else had said that they would
have thought nothing of it why was
i different

 kerry rose from his chair and
started around the table what is it
alec whats come up

  my god do i have to- my voice
was too high i lowered it ive
got some money in a savings account
and some in war bonds the rest ur-
sula will make good

  kerry had stopped where he was
his hand on the back of georges chair
it was unusual for a man to want a lot
of cash on a saturday night but not
so unusal that they had to stare at me
like that

  ursula youll give them your
checks for their cash wont you i
persisted ill pay you part of it back
next week but the rest will take time
ursula turned to mr spencer on
her left oliver how much have you

  he pulled out a roll that he could
barely get two hands around evident-
ly he had come here directly frem the

store how much do you want he
asked me

be we can get close to it if everybody
here cashes ursulas checks i knew
art masterson always carried a wad
five thousand dollars

  it was as if a bucket of cold water
had been poured down from the ceil-
ing even masterson and dietz looked
startled

  ursula was the first to recover she
made her voice as casual as if she held
a straight flush and was luring suckers
if you need that much money alec
of course you can have it what do
you want it for

  i cant tell you

  george winkler stood up and step-
ped around kerry who hadnt moved
lets go upstairs and have a talk
alec

  theres nothing to talk about
dont any of you trust me sweat
trickled under my basque shirt

  george is your friend and lawyer
ursula said placatingly id certain-
ly ask his advice if i considered spend-
ing that much money

  with the back of my hand i wiped
sweat from my upper lip confiding
in george or in any of them would
ruin whatever chance remained of bor-
rowing the cash from their point of
view the deal was fantastic schneid-
er coudnt have a name worth buying
for two cents because to them the
name could only be my own

  ursula i asked a simple favor i
said striving to keep my voice even
i cant tell you why i must have that
cash tonight but i need it desperately
do i get it

  if youll tell george or me what
you want it for

  i was up against a wall i opened
my mouth i felt i was going to
shout and snapped it shut i ran up


mammoth mystery

the stairs feet came after me in
the hall i turned george winkler ap-
peared through the door

  alec he panted if youre think-
ing of leaving town-

jt should have occurred to me
that they would pounce on that
idea i was a psychoneurotic instead
of getting the rest i needed when i re-
turned home id gone through the ter-
rific strain of a murder trial and my
questioning of them this afternoon
had shown them that i was brooding
over it so now i was planning to cut
and run it was their duty to prevent
me

  im not leaving home i said if
i do it will be only for a few days to
follow a trail

  trail

  to lilys murderer maybe

  georges small sharp eyes probed
me five thousand dollars is a lot
of money for a few days

  i dont want it for that damn it
how can you expect me to be frank
and open if you keep thinking- i
choked the rest off id been shout-
ing into his ear never mind i said
and went upstairs

  i took a stinging cold shower that
washed off the sweat and loosened the
nerves i sat on the edge of the tub
smoking a cigarette and let the air dry
me they were so sympathetic so
knowing so smart i grinned sud-
denly at the tiled wall all right id
show them what smart really was i
dressed in fresh clothes and went
down

  in the cardroom i found a studied
attempt to forget the scene id made
twenty minutes ago take me for
granted in stride just another guy
they must have agreed among them-
selves that that was the proper treat-
ment for somebody who was rocky on

his mental base

  i sat down in the empty chair be-
side bevis and spread a smile around
the table im sorry i cut up folks
i said lets have a stack of chips

  ursula as always was the banker
she gave me a stack of blues and a
stack of whites and marked the total
down on a pad

  they were glad to have me now
well see some action masterson
gloated and ursula doubtless thought
the game would be good for me

  the game ran into doldrums it hap-
pens now and then for no reasons the
cards forgot how to match or did at the
wrong time there was too much
private conversation around the table
a sure sign of lagging interest

  limit stud poker isnt poker i
said in disgust how about pepping
it up with some table stakes

  mastersons eyes glittered now
youre talking

  nobody objected though ursula
who didnt like the games to go too
high in her house stipulated that the
stacks be limited to twenty-five dollars
miriam wisely dropped out leaving
eight players

t the end of a couple of rounds i
owed ursula for seven stacks of
chips puzzled glances were directed
at me bevis asked whats hap-
pened to your game while you were
away

  play your game i said ill play
mine

  it wasnt that i was losing it was
the way i lost i played high and wild
tapping an opponent with only angles
to back me up i took one pot and got
caught on all the rest a housewife
would have shown better acumen in a
penny-ante game

  ursula came around to my chair and
suggested that maybe i was too tired
the spider lily



to play

  let me alone i said and saw dietz
on the last turn when he had an obvious
cinch on board i pulled a case seven
to make two pair and raked in the chips
with a nasty chuckle id like to be
tired like this all the time i told
ursula

  hell i heard you were a player
dietz growled that was nothing but
damn fool luck

 nobody else commented the
anxious shaded glances were again
being directed at me they were get-
ting the idea i was still obsessed by
five thousand dollars and was making
these frantic and impossible attempts
to get it

  at midnight masterson opened
strongly with an ace on the first turn
ursula folded oliver spencer show-
ing a seven hesitated and then saw
george hung on with a four dietz and
kerry blew bevis spencer kicked
vigorously with a queen and i with
an insignificant five showing tagged
along

  it was back to masterson he re-
raised bevis reraise and mr spencer
no longer hesitant kicked it once more
george decided that he was out of his
depth and turned his nine down bevis
saw

  it was my turn there had been
enough action to indicate what was
what if masterson had held aces back
to back he would have sat tight merely
dragging along for the first couple of
turns to keep the others in and make
a pot for himself i figured him for a
picture against his ace probably a
king mr spencer very likely held a
pair of sevens he wouldnt have re-
raised on less and yet wasnt too con-
fident with a low pair against an open
ace and an open queen bevis queen
bothered me somewhat id have to
feel him out

  i raised mutters rose from those
at the table who were out of the hand
this looked as if it would build up to
something

  your backed fives dont mean a
thing alec masterson said how
many chips have you im tapping
you

  i had the lowest stack on the table
seven dollars oliver and bevis spencer
both matched the tap and i shoved in
my stack which ended the round

izerry was dealing he slapped
a nine down beside my five and
scowled he was obviously rooting for
me so were miriam and ursula they
had a notion that a nice pot would be
good for my morale masterson bought
a queen which bevis needed mr
spencer a jack bevis a tray

  masterson fingered his chips and
looked at the bare space behind my
cards

  i sat back and smiled im getting
a free ride for the rest of this hand
thats the trouble with table stakes
too bad the wraps arent off

  you mean no limit mr spencer
said he turned up a corner of his hole
card as if to reassure himself and
shrugged it suits me what do you
say masterson

  masterson grinned lovingly down at
his open ace and queen to me no
limit means no limit lets use the yel-
low chips at fifty bucks each

  im blowing anyway bevis said
so do what you like

  ursula protested though not vigor-
ously poker was in her blood but
only this hand she conceded at the
end of it youll settle up for your yellow
chips and well go back to table stakes
masterson still high man on board
chipped two yellows mr spencer like
me had decided not to believe in mas-
tersons ace-queen but all the same he


mammoth mystery

was shaky he saw without re-raising
i said im bluff-proof and upped it
two hundred dollars

  in the sudden silence i could hear
my heart thump though i wasnt nervr
ous i wasnt sweating this was poker
all the faces but two were featureless
blobs circling the table and the two
that concerned me wore the blankness
of long poker experience

  wait a minute masterson said
i expect to pay off at the end of this
hand if i lose can you alec

  i told him that i had fifteen hun-
dred dollars and that if it went higher
ursula would back me ursula wet her
lower lip and gave a searching look and
nodded masterson said good
enough lets play for real money
ill go two hundred bucks better

  it was a good play by the high man
on board who was certain the other two
held small pairs it should have chased
us to cover

  mr spencer pondered poker to him
was a saturday nights relaxation at
which he won or lost a top sum of one
hundred dollars usually a lot less he
was scared beneath that deadpan i
didnt worry him he couldnt see me
as more than fives against his sevens
but masterson could be holding another
queen out of sight or even have aces
backed up from the first on the other
hand it was just as likely that mas-
terson with two cards still to be seen
was speculating on pairing an ace or
king or queen

  mr spencer asked ursula for ten
more yellow chips and counted out
eight of them-four hundred dollars
covering my re-raise and mastersons
then he sat tight holding his nerves
together

  i raised it five hundred masterson
looked momentarily shocked which
told me beyond doubt that he had only
angles he did no more than see me

and mr spencer afraid of masterson
and not at all of me did the same

  kerry had to be spoken to twice be-
fore he roused himself suffitiently to
deal all three of us bought i caught
a second open nine masterson a king
mr spencer a second open jack

                    it

jphe silence dissolved everybody
but the three players started to
talk it up to relieve the tension i sat
with a five and two nines indicating
two pair masterson showing an ace
queen king indicated a high pair mr
spencers seven and two jacks were ob-
viously a pair of sevens and a pair of
jacks

  mr spencer high now with an open
pair of jacks negligently bought more
yellow chips and dropped ten of them
into the pot he didnt expect a re-
turn it was pure show an expres-
sion of triumph

  i asked ursula for more chips she
said in bewilderment alec do you
know what youre doing

  ive played poker before i said
dryly ill either win or lose may i
have a thousand dollars worth im
kicking

  the silence returned ursulas hands
shook as she pushed the chips to me i
continued them in motion into the pot
masterson folded as silently as the
arabs folding their tents his high
pair had no meaning

  mr spencer took at least a minute to
make up his mind the way he fumbled
with his stacks of blue and white chips
which were practically worthless in this
hand showed how puzzled he was
if i hadnt had fives backed up origi-
nally why had i ridden along to
speculate id bought a second pair
but so had he and his two pairs were
higher

  slowly he nodded youre bucking
the odds without reason to get the
the spider lily



money you want youve been playing
like that all night youre not in the
right frame of mind for poker lets
call this hand off and return all the
money

  he was being gracious he could
only see me taking one chance in twelve
to draw another five or nine for a full
house the odds went higher because
he had just as good chance to buy
those werent odds a poker player in
his right mind would accept if it cost
as much as i was investing except a
player who was frantic for money and
not in his senses he-and they-had
me all figured out they were so damn
smart

  theres no law against you going
out i said

  he scowled angrily at me he didnt
like this at all he had too much
money invested to be noble and let me
take the pot and at the same time there
would be no triumph in winning from
a crackpot he counted out ten yel-
low chips if you insist on being
foolish ill just see you he said

  on the final turn kerry gave me a
four and mr spencer a ten he re-
mained high man on board he was
elaborately kind checking with a tired
paternal smile i wiped it off his face
by chipping a thousand dollars

  no ursula said this is a ridicu-
lous bluff oliver the poor boy-

  chip or get out mr spencer i
said

  the tired smile returned i could
see the noble gesture in the offing hed
call the debt off when the hands were
shown it wasnt ethical tt take candy
from a baby or a madman he saw
me

  i turned up my hole card it was a
nine

jr long seconds they were dazed

  masterson leaned sideways past

ursula to make sure my three nines
werent spots before his eyes mr
spencer looked sick he was a rich
man as rich men went in west amber
but it was a lot of money to lose

  i raked in the chips and started to
stack them - yellows and blues and
whites mostly yellow i heard dietz
say in wonder holy cats you
backed those first raises with only a
nine in the hole and a five showing of
all the dumb luck

  luck kerry was washing the
deck and grinning broadly youve
just seen poker played mister

  like my missus plays it dietz
said sourly she goes in on an im-
possible nothing and sometimes she
wins that doesnt make it poker

  i had lost track of the number of
chips in the pot but there should be
more than enough i started to count
them

  you have to understand what was
happening kerry told dietz alec
played for five thousand dollars the
small losses didnt concern him only
the one big killing didnt you notice
the way he was playing looking at one
or two cards to see if he was in the
right position sometimes he specu-
lated wildly to put us off guard to make
us think he hadnt any brains left
when he caught a nine in the hole and
a five showing he played the open five
like a pair why not what did he
have to lose except for a few dollars to
get a look at the next card hed tried
it before and it hadnt worked but
sooner or later it would he pulled a
nine to match his hole card and he was
set did you notice how he sucked
them in to remove the limit that was
part of the master plan from that
time on the odds were on his side mr
spencer bought a second pair but alec
caught a third nine and then he really
went to town on a cinch dont tell


mammoth mystery

me youve seen better poker

  i was over five thousand in my
counting i heard mr spencer ask
how many yellows did i buy ur-
sula

  i looked up he was writing a
check

  id like as much as possible of that
in cash if you dont mind i said

  mr spencer patted his dome my
checks are good

  i know but you have a lot of cash
on you and i need it it wont make
any difference to you

  i never pay out large sums in cash
his hairless head dipped to the check-
book

  i turned to masterson what
about you art

  ive got around three hundred
bucks but i need it over the weekend
masterson said ill have to make it
a check too

  i stood up and looked down at
ursula she was sitting between mas-
terson and mr spencer she averted
her eyes

  i felt the shakes coming i ran my
tongue over my lips but my tongue was
just as dry then miriam was on one
side of me and kerry on the other are
you sick miriam asked anxiously

i feel wonderful i said whats
better than to be with the people you
can turn to when you need them
there was dull silence behind me as
i went up the stairs

chapter xii

emil schneider

tt was after one oclock when they
departed i watched them from the
window of my room oliver and bevis
spencer got into one car art master-
son and dietz into another and both
cars drove off several minutes later

kerry nugent and george winkler and
miriam came out together they stood
at the foot of the porch steps i tried
to hear what they said but all i could
get out of the low jumble of words was
my name

  there was a light knock on the door
i turned from the window and said
come in and ursula entered

  her right fist was filled with money
she dropped it on my dresser there
was  in that pot she said

  i went to the dresser and pushed the
money apart there were a couple of
fifties but the rest was in twenties and
tens and smaller stuff how much of
it is this

  every dollar in cash i had and
could accumulate from the players-
 most of it came from oliver
spencer i hold checks for the balance
due you in her hand she held a slip
of paper from the pad actually you
made  profit on that hand the
rest were your own chips which you
owed me before that youd lost 
so theres still  coming to you for
a total amount of  in winnings
she recited those overwhelming sums
in the monotone of an accountant giv-
ing a report her face was unnatur-
ally fleshy lined and lumpy with an in-
ner weariness

  what made you change your
mind i asked while i was raking
in the pot you whispered to art mast-
erson and mr spencer not to pay off
any of it in cash

  its what you said just before they
left the cardroom-about people you
could turn to when you needed them
that hurt more than you knew had
i ever failed you alec

  she had failed me in letting reason
dominate faith in me yet at the same
time she had backed me all the way
and objectively i should have been
grateful i was objectively
the spider lily



  i put my hands on her shoulders
youve always been swell to me
her eyes somber and anxious were
only a couple of inches lower than mine
im praying that im not making a
terrible mistake

  by letting me have the cash dont
worry the worst ill do with it is
throw it away

  ursula stepped away from my hands
and started toward the door

  one more favor i said can you
let me have your check for 
that includes what you still owe me
from the game plus a  personal
loan which ill repay you next week
she turned with her hand on the
knob tonight

  id like it in ten minutes and
please make it out to cash

  she stood there debating with her-
self if you wish she said listlessly
and closed the door behind her

  i heard a car start up in the drive-
way and then another george and
kerry were leaving the downstairs
door closed as miriam came into the
house

t made a neat pile of the money and
stuck it into the right pocket of my
slacks the wad bulged the material
emil schneider had said midnight but
he wasnt leaving until morning he
would have to be satisfied with close
to half of it in cash it was a lot of
money if he insisted on the full five
thousand id give him ursulas check
and he would have to accept my word
that it wouldnt be slopped at the bank
monday morning

  i had done all i could it was now
up to him to take it or leave it

ursula had the check in her hand
when i went down to the living room
miriam was with her they looked
down at the bulge in my pants pocket
id like to use the car ursula i

said ill only do a few miles
youre driving to the station
miriam asked huskily

  look i said testily theres
nothing i have to run away from or
want to im going to see somebody
in town and come right back

  ursula studied the check as if she
were seeing it for the first time the
cash in your pocket and this check
makes an even five thousand dollars
why that round sum what are you
going to do with it

  something foolish maybe i took
the check from her lax fingers and slid
it into my wallet thanks a lot may
i have the car

  anything you want ursula said
dully

rjhere was no moon low threat-
ening clouds blotted out the stars
i parked in front of the shed garage
and cut the headlights immediately i
was blacked out except for the lighted
windows in emil schneiders house a
couple of hundred feet away i took
the flashlight out of the glove compart-
ment and went up the wooden steps
the birch rails were white markers
toward the house

  i had reached the flagstone walk
when the porch light went on the
door opened schneider still in his un-
dershirt came out to the head of the
porch steps and peered to his left
linn he said then the corner of
his eyes must have seen my light for
he started to turn to me he never
completed that turn

  the shot was louder than any can-
non i had ever heard it was the silence
that had preceeded it and the unex-
pected quality of the sound i felt
myself jump and for a moment i
thought i was hit i didnt feel any-
thing but i had seen a ground crew
sergeant have his arm blown off by a


mammoth mystery

 mm cannon without feeling it until
later

  the gun sounded again not as loud
this time because the startling effect
was gone i dropped flat on the field-
stone nip strafers had conditioned
my reflexes or maybe id been hit
i wriggled nothing hurt

  the silence was back i raised my
head schneider was no longer on the
porch and i saw movement out from
the left corner of the house-a mo-
mentary glimpse of something i knew
was human only because it was tall and
erect something like a long rod ex-
tended out from it and then merged
with the shadow it made a rifle

  i leaped up and ran forward reck-
less with that mixture of fear and anger
which makes heroes of men under fire
i saw schneider then under the
bright porch light he was a motionless
splotch at the head of the steps my
throat uttered an animal cry that had
no words in it i veered toward the
corner of the house

  the shape was gone in the darkness
i heard the familiar swish of brush
when somebody crashes through it the
batteries of my flashlight were weak
the spray spread out a few feet and
petered off i ran sweeping the feeble
beam in an arc i reached the brush
and went through it then the light
touched trees-big stuff elms and oaks
the woods i knew ran down the side
of the slope to the edge of old mill
road there was no sound but the
clamor of katydids

  abruptly everything washed out of
me but fear i doused the light and in
the darkness stumbled back to the
house when i reached the fringe of
light flowing out from the porch and two
side windows i looked over my shoul-
der there was no point to the gesture
only a black curtain lay behind me i
ducked low and raced around to the

porch and up the steps

  emil schneider had not moved he
would never move there was a hole
in his turned-up cheek

  i had seen a lot of dead men but this
was like lily being dead-intensely
personal as if death were reaching out
from the flesh it had conquered and
touching me blood rushed to my head
as i bent over him i yanked myself
erect but my head continued to whirl
i grabbed at one of the posts at the
head of the steps and heard myself
whimper

  dont let it get you  i said aloud
keep your head 

tt went away a little i didnt

  need the post i pushed myself
away from it and i saw a light coming
up the walk

  panic hit me i glanced in frenzy
and then scooted into the house

  what the hell alec a voice called

  running feet slapped the flagstone
i hesitated in the hall and went back to
the door on my toes and looked through
the small rectangular door window

  kerry nugent had reached the foot
of the porch steps he stared at the
thing on the porch and then came up
slowly god he said and raised his
head he couldnt have missed seeing
me go into the house alec he said
softly

  he hadnt a rifle in his hand and
there was nowhere in his summer uni-
form where he could hide one i came
out across the dead man we looked
at each other

  kerry had no words the silence
between us was beyond endurance i
said funny youre always right be-
hind me when somebody is murdered

  another one he said

  what are you doing here i de-
manded

  kerry came all the way on the porch
the spider lily



and carefully skirted the body and
stood beside me you acted queer
he said about that five thousand
bucks when ursula collected all the
cash there was it was plain shed
changed her mind and was going to give
you the money what did you want it
for

  schneider saw who murdered lily
he was going to sell me the name
kerry gave me a quick sidelong look
the way youve been acting we
thought you might be planning to run
away there was no need youd been
acquitted or maybe youd do some-
thing else with the money that -
that-

  say it that a mental case like
me might do i had to be protected
from myself-the way youd all done it
last time

  kerry didnt bother to argue that
he said we decided that i park down
the road and follow you if you came
out

  miriam again

  miriam and george winkler and i
we talked it over outside the house just
before i left so i trailed your car and
saw you turn up schneiders driveway

t looked down toward the parking
circle in front of the shed garage
it was too dark to see my car you
didnt follow me all the way i said
i didnt hear your car you knew this
was a deadend driveway so you parked
on ivy lane and walked the rest of the
way you came to spy on me

  his square jaw jutted sure i did
why not if youre going to go around

killing-

  damn it i screamed i didnt
now youre condemning me without
even hearing my side of it

   all right im listening

  i put a cigarette between my lips but
my shaking hands wouldnt let me give

  myself a light kerry snapped on his
lighter and held it for me his hand
was as nerveless as a rock between
puffs i told him

  he listened with stolid patience
when i finished he went to the dead
man and knelt beside him one slug
entered his side below the left armpit
the other entered his cheek and went
all the way through i dont know how
he managed to scream before he died
scream

  i heard two shots while i was com-
ing down the driveway and then a

scream

   i screamed when i started to chase
the murderer it gushed out of me by
itself

  kerry straightened up and stared at
me there were only two shots alec
those were enough to kill him
but theyre both in schneider
kerry looked down the path and then
turned to the left side of the house
why would anybody risk shooting
schneider just as you were coming up
the path and why didnt he shoot
you when you were chasing him you
were in the light of the porch for at
least a few seconds and you said you
chased him with your flash on why
didnt he take a shot at you then
there was an answer there had to
be but i couldnt straighten one out in
my head there was a sick throbbing
tiredness in back of my skull which
wouldnt let me think how should
i know why he acted like that my
voice was high strident ive got some
question of my own how the hell do
you happen to show up every time
somebody is murdered

  i told you

  and i dont like it

  he turned his head listening it was
only the sound of a distant car proba-
bly on old mill road

kerry said sharply lets get out


mammoth mystery

of here  and put his hard hand on my
arm

  that was something i could agree
with side by side we went down the
walk and down the wooden steps he
held onto my arm like a policeman
with his prisoner i thought

  when we reached my car i said
are you going to take me to the police
in person or are you going to call them
on the phone

  dont be a dope ill help you go
wherever you want

  savagely i wrenched open the car
door im going home and i can get
there without help

  he was walking back to his car
parked on ivy lane when i passed him
on the driveway he stepped into high
grass to let my car go by halfway
home i saw his headlights behind me
his car remained glutd to my taillight
the rest of the way home

chapter xiii
flight

tvflriam and ursula came out on
the porch when they heard our
cars i remained seated behind the
wheel without will to move kerry got
out of his car and walked stiff-legged to
my window like a traffic cop about to
hand out a ticket he opened the door
come on he said

  i nodded sluggishly and cut the igni-
tion and lights kerry helped me out
as if i were sick when my feet were
on the ground i shook him off and
strode ahead he caught up to me and
walked at my side up the porch steps
what is it ursula asked tightly
emil schneider was shot dead
kerry said

  miriam made a thin moaning sound
and crossed her arms over her breasts
ursula stared with her mouth open

rather foolishly

  that was a delicately objective
statement of fact kerry i said and
leaned against the house and laughed
in a way that hurt my throat

  ursula moved to my side alec for
heavens sake

  my laughter crumpled into ragged
bits which i coughed away i said sav-
agely emil schneider was shot
dead not somebody unknown shot
schneider not even alec put a
couple of slugs in him thats assumed
somebody is murdered in west amber
and who else would do it

  did you ursula whispered

  why bother asking i said you
knew the answer right away

  i pushed myself away from the wall
and went into the house slamming the
door behind me the handset phone
was on the table in the hall i picked
it up

  the door flew open kerry came in
fast he wrapped his fingers around
my right wrist and pushed the handset
away from my mouth what do you
think youre going to do he de-
manded

  call the police ive nothing to
hide

  whats the rush he said

  i shoved my free hand against his
chest and strove to pull the mouth-
piece up to my mouth he was too
strong i twisted my body to him and
jabbed my knee up he grunted hol-
lowly his fingers loosened but only
slightly

  abruptly the fight went out of me
though kerry was the one who was
hurt the handset fell to the floor
kerry released my wrist and crouched
and put both handu down where my
knee had struck him his face wa
very white

  are you hurt bad i asked him
contritely
the spider lily



  not much he became aware of
ursula and miriam in the hall and
raised his hands up to the pit of his
stomach

  the phone was cackling on the floor
ursula scooped it up said never
mind operator and hung up then
she looked at me my god alec
she said

tvtiriam stood in the open doorway

     that pathetic sickness in her
eyes was harder to take than horror
would have been i turned and went
as far as the stairs and dropped down
on the second one i ran sweaty
palms over my face

  what do you want from me i
said and my voice was sobbing are
you trying to protect me the way you
did the last time so everybody will be-
lieve im a murderer i never harmed
anybody in my life except indirectly in
war

  kerry straightened up beads of
perspiration stood out on his forehead
but he was taking the pain like the
tight-lipped he-man he was i think
he said slowly that we ought to call
george winkler at once

  damn it no lawyers i said
they can burn me in the electric chair
but no lawyer is going to give me the
works this time i didnt kill schneider
why would i i needed him alive to
buy a name from him the name of
the person who killed lily

  miriam moved forward from the
doorway she sat down beside me on
the stairs and took myhot hand be-
tween her cold palms alec what
happened

  i bowed my head and creased my
brow as if in that way i could push the
sluggishness out of my brain

  i dont know what happened i
said i tried to think while driving
home but straight thoughts refuse to

come i must be too shocked too
tired the things i saw and know are
wrong the way lilys murder was
wrong its like a mathematical equa-
tion which always gives the wrong an-
swer no matter which way you work it
always the same answer with my name
standing for x and im the only one
who knows that it cant be right but
whats wrong about it i cant tell

   i doubt if any of them followed me
but they listened patiently

  i looked up here is what is true
and definite schneider saw who mur-
dered lily he visited her that night
after he spoke to her on the phone
when he got there he saw somebody
sneak out the back door and he found
lily with the knife in her heart he
beat it to save his own neck and kept
quiet about what he had seen i doped
out that thats what must have hap-
pend he admitted to me that he had
seen the murderers face and would
let me have the name for five thousand
dollars

  ursula said why didnt you tell
me

  would you have let me have the
money if i had would you have be-
lieved my story when you were con-
vinced that the murderers name was
my own and if you did believe me
what would i be buying schneider
refused to go to the district attorney
with me he might be the murderer
himself or he might pull a name out
of the air it looked like a gold brick

jerry was leaning against the
wall still in pain and not showing
much of it that part sounds as bad
as the rest he said not to me i
just dont know im thinking what
the police will think five thousand
bucks for a name you couldnt know
was the right one and with which you
couldnt do anything if you had it
	mammoth mystery

  of course it was a gamble a
lead maybe a straw to clutch at- no
 more a suckers buy but not for me
and not for the murderer

   miriams hands lightened over mine
dont you see that alec had to do it
she told the others earnestly it
means so much to him

  thanks miriam i gave her a
weak smile it was worth the money
to me i know now i would have re-
ceived value from schneider he
wasnt the murderer because the mur-
derer murdered him and he had the
right name thats why he was shot
theres a lot i cant get straight in my
head but this much i can schneider
needed money desperately hed lost
his job at the bank his wife was di-
vorcing him she owned the house he
was broke if hed sunk so low that
he would take that kind of money from
me why not capitalize on what hed
seen by blackmailing the murderer
buts thats a dangerous business a
person who had murdered once will
murder again to protect himself
schneider was scared hed have been
sure of collecting that five thousand
dollars from me if hed hung around
town till the bank opened monday
morning but nothing could stop him
from taking the first train out tomor-
row morning nothing but a couple
of bullets

  and he was shot down before your
eyes kerry said

  i took my hand from between mir-
iams palms and set fire to a cigarette
i did not look at anybody

  he was shot while you were with
him ursula asked thinly

   it was about fifty feet away on the
walk to his house he put on the
porch light and looked to his left and
said my name probably he heard
somebody he was expecting me i
chased the killer but the nights black

and all i glimpsed was a shadow at
the edge of the window light it could
have been either a man or woman i
dragged at my cigarette it doesnt
make sense in several ways kerry
knows why and the rest of you are fig-
uring it out theres only one answer
but its the vwong one im the only
one who knows its wrong because im
the only one who knows i didnt kill
him

  miriam reached for my hand i
wouldnt let her take it i stood up

  i had no right to come back here
i said if the police arent called all
you will be in this with me kerry
let me use the phone

  he left the support of the wall and
hooked his thumbs in his belt you
couldnt tell by his face whether he
was still in pain we four are the
only ones who know you were at
schneiders house tonight he said

  ursula pounced on that of course
theres no hurry its late and were
tired suppose we all get a good nights
sleep and then well see

t nodded slowly id be helpless
in jail cut off from any opportunity
to prove my innocence once in the
hands of the police id be bully and
badgered by them and by my own law-
yers too id gone through it once it
wasnt anything to be faced again i
needed time to rest and to think in free
air

  suits me i said and turned mir-
iam shifted on the step to give me
room to pass her i remembered some-
thing did you and george send
kerry to follow me

  they didnt send me kerry said
angrily the three of us decided it
did you i asked miriam

  her dark grave eyes studied me
not quite understanding yes she
said
the spider lily



  i went up the stairs somebody
came behind me kerry entered my
room a moment after i did i sat down
on the bed and looked at him what
now i asked

  nothing but sleep he said let
me help you with your shoes

  i told him i wasnt an invalid and
undressed myself he got my pajamas
out of the drawer and pulled down the
bed covers the close pal the fellow
officer putting a drunken or ill or men-
tally deranged comrade to bed i
crawled in and said arent you go-
ing to kiss me good-night

  he grinned thats the way i like
to hear you talk

  hows the groin i asked

  nasty for a minute or two its
all right now

  it was a dirty trick

  forget it

  he went to the door and put a finger
on the light-button and turned he
loqked at the wall at my rifle hanging
there

  i said anyway you know i didnt
kill him with that

  he put out the light and closed the
door behind him

  i lay in darkness and listened to him
go down the stairs there were low
voices in the hall after a while the
voices went into the living room which
was directly below my room i got
out of bed and put my ear against the
floor but distinct words didnt come
through without putting on a light
i groped my way to my shirt on a chair
and fumbled out cigarettes and
matches i sat on the edge of the bed
smoking listening for kerrys car to
depart it didnt

t was on my fourth cigarette when i
heard a car in the driveway it was
arriving not leaving i went to the
window george winkler slammed the

car door and ran up the porch steps
he was too big and clumsy to run
this was important this was murder

  i tossed my cigarette out of the win-
dow and crossed the room in darkness
and went out to the head of the stairs
all four were in the living room keep-
ing their voices low in order not to wake
me they thought they had me safe-
ly and snugly out of the way while they
consulted a friend and lawyer about
me they didnt need me there to hear
any more of my side theyd heard
enough and it was like the last time
an outrage to common sense but i
was a brother a foster-cousin a pal
so they had to do what they could for
me

  i started down the stairs my bare
feet coming down hard but making no
sound i was shaking worse than at
any time i could remember i gripped
the bannister with both hands and
clung i mustnt give into it burst-
ing in on them in this condition would
not help me

  are you sure nobody saw you or
alec george winkler said in the liv-
ing room

  i could hear them from here the
arched doorless living room entrance
was only five feet from the foot of the
stairs i leaned over the bannister
listening

  it was after one-thirty kerry was
saying and dark as the inside of a
pocket there wasnt a light in any
house and if anybody saw either of
us they saw only a car pass or a shape
walking behind a flashlight unless
they happened to be looking at
schneiders porch but the house cant
be seen from the road or from any
nearby house its on a ledge at the end
of five hundred feet of driveway and a
couple of hundred feet past that

  but the shots george said

  two loud noises kerry said


mammoth mystery

maybe a truck backfiring on old mill
road for what anybody who heard
them knew i wasnt sure they were
shots when i heard them even though
i was half-expecting something to hap-
pen besides nobody came to the house
or called out or showed a light the
body mightnt be found for a week if
we keep our mouths shut

  i heard restless feet pace the floor
then george said my god do you
folks realize what youre doing were
accomplices after the fact in the eyes
of the law were as guilty as alec kerry
especially he saw alec and the mur-
dered man and didnt report it

  ill do more than that for alec
kerry said

  theres nothing to point to alec
ursula said all we have to do is
say nothing

  george snorted do you think the
police are dummies as soon as they
find schneider with two bullets in him
theyll pile on alec he murdered his
wife because she was unfaithful to him
he was acquitted by the jury not be-
cause there was any doubt of his guilt
but because of extenuating circum-
stances then a couple of days after
hes released the man with whom she
had betrayed him in particular is found
murdered its a pattern you cant get
away from his wife and her chief lover
murdered you dont know how thor-
oughly the police work theyll find
out about the poker game tonight
theyll learn that alec was desperate
for five thousand dollars in cash and
that he got a good part of it theyll
establishd the time of death as not
long afterward theyll conclude that
alec coldly planned the murder and
needed getaway money

  no miriam cried i cant let
you say that about alec he didnt
murder either of them

  how do you know george de-

manded

  he said so

feorge delivered himself of an-
other snort its your privilege
to believe that he almost had me be-
lieving that he was innocent of lilys
murder but now with schneider shot


  alec didnt try to run away ur-
sula said he cime home and wanted
to call the police

  because kerry saw him george
said the fight went out of him he
was ready to give up you can never
tell what anybody so emotionally un-
stable will do

  hold it kerry said youve got
the arguments on your side but-
my side george said im giv-
ing the polices side ill do all i can
for him but i cant see where it will
be enough

  we know you will kerry said
thats why we phoned you to come
right over but alec said he an idea
schneider was blackmailing somebody
and the blackmailer killed him
and vou believed him george
said

  there was a brief silence then ur-
sula said if the fight went out of
alec why didnt he confess

  how do i know george said
you people are groping for anything
at all to help you believe him so am
i but look at the terrific coincidences
this afternoon alec and i discussed
laws of chance he tried to show me
mathematically that walking into lilys
bungalow a few minutes after she was
murdered and under circumstances
that pointed directly to him as the mur-
derer wasnt such a great coincidence
after all i might concede that though
with reservations but when it hap-
pens a second time-when alec walks
up to schneiders house at the precise
the spider lily



moment when somebody is aiming a
gun at schneider a man alec has rea-
son to hate that becomes incredible
he paused i could hear feet nerv-
ously prowling the floor-georges
feet proably-and i heard nothing
else they hadnt any answer for him
neither had i

  you cant get around coincidences
like that george went on not one
coincidence and certainly not two
and look at the rest of it the gun-
man hears and sees alecs car pull up
and sees alec come up to the house be-
hind a flashlight does the gunman
postpone the shooting does he run to
cover does he take a shot at alec
first to protect himself not this gun-
man he blandly goes ahead and kills
schneider as if he had all the world to
himself then he runs alec whos
supposed to have sense chases him un-
armed and with his flashlight on does
the gunman turn around and shoot
alec whos a clear target and perhaps
has recognized him not this gunman
hes every bit as thoughtless for his
own safety as alec is and then alec
loses him and hurries back to the porch
in time for kerry to find him standing
over the body

  the gun miriam said why
didnt alec have a gun when kerry
saw him

  thats right kerry agreed his
rifle is up in his room i saw it when
i went up there with him

  how do you know a rifle killed
schneider

t heard the shots iterry said

    i can tell the difference between a
rifle and a small gun a rifle booms a
a hand gun barks and id say the rifle
was bigger than alecs 

  that doesnt get us anywhere
george said he wouldnt use his
own gun especially not if he had

planned this in advance this is hunt-
ing country practically every house
has a rifle of some sort he could have
stolen one or maybe driven to trevan
or somewhere this afternoon and
bought one then after shooting
schneider he tossed it away in the
brush thats another problem we have
to face its probably near there with
his fingerprints all over it
probably miriam exclaimed in
outrage

  miriam youll wake alec ursula
warned her

  i dont care why shouldnt he
be down here to defend himself youre
fools-you especially george youre
supposed to be a lawyer cant you
get it into your head that if alec had
deliberately set out to murder some-
body he would never concoct such ridi-
culous stories hes so clear-headed so
intelligent hed have a perfectly logi-
cal story to tell the fact that what
he told us doesnt seem to make sense
proves that hes innocent

  leaning over the bannister in my pa-
jamas i smiled to the wall smart
girl miriam shed got to the heart
of it

  id agree george said so softly
that i had difficulty hearing his words
if these werent crimes of passion
which would make any man lose his
head id even agree if he were nor-
mal we know he isnt look at the
way hes acted since he was acquitted
brooding beating his brains out speak-
ing of nothing but lilys death isnt
it obvious that it was jealousy of
schneider that was gnawing at him

  i swung from the bannister to go
down to them i forced myself to sit
down and clasped my knees hard my
heart ticked off the long seconds of
quiet in the living room even
georges pacing had ceased

  miriam spoke and her voice was low


mammoth mystery

now and broken i dont believe it
i cant

  how are you going to get around
facts and incredible coincidences
george said but say were convinced
hes innocent-what do we do i see on-
ly two alternatives and neither of them
is pleasant we can sit tight and see
what develops plenty will the police
will question alec will he deny that he
was near schneiders house tonight
not in his state of mind hell confess
or more likely hell doggedly stick to
the story he told you the way he did
to his equally absurd story of lilys
murder we four will be in hot water
for having held out on the police ill
be lucky to get away with being dis-
barred the other alternative is to
call the police now in either event
alec will stand trial

  what will his chances be kerry
asked

  bad george said a clever law-
yer like magee can beat one murder
but two will have him licked alecs
been acquitted for lilys murder so
that cant be brought into the trial but
the da will find ways to link it up be-
sides it will be impossible to get a jury
that isnt aware that alec had murdered
his wife and that the man for whose
murder he was being tried had been her
lover frankly i think the only thing
we can hope for is to have him found
insane and sent to a mental institu-
tion

  ursula said briskly you over-
looked a third alternative alec can
go to south america

t stood up and descended three

  steps and stopped the staircase
wobbled the ceiling was coming down
on me my throat was raw with a
scream that i would not let past my
lips

  do you realize what you suggest

george said hes murdered two peo-
ple im not saying hes to blame
lets say the war twisted something in
his brain murder has become a habit
to express his emotions

  that couldnt be ursulas voice i
heard but it was the deepness had
gone out of it she whimpered my
god george youre wrong

  maybe i am george said id
do anything for you ursula but i
cant take this chance im going home
now do whatever you think best and
i promise to keep my mouth shut
im sorry but thats as far as i can
go-

  i raced up the stairs running away
but in my pajamas i could go only as
far as my room when i had the door
closed between me and them i stood
against it breathing hard

  georges car left but kerry didnt
under the floor i hear their voices ptill
muttering they were deciding my
fate sheltering me and protecting me
in their love offering me what was
worse than jail or a mental institution
or the electric chair to be an eternal
fugitive in a foreign land

  i put on the light and smoked a ci-
garette down to my fingers there was
a fourth alternative which had oc-
curred to none of them i put on my
gray tweed suit and stuffed the 
in cash i had won at poker into a poc-
ket my two windows opened out on
the flat porch roof i climbed out and
slid down the post and landed among
the hollyhocks

  an open living room window was al-
most within reach i heard kerry say
miserably im willing to bet we cant
make him go away but its worth a
try i cant see anything else

  a woman was sobbing i looked
through the window miriam sat on the
couch with a handkerchief to her face
and her shoulders shaking ursula
the spider lily



wept also but on her feet and silently
i had never thought that i would see
ursula weep

  i walked into the darkness

chapteir xiv
shadows and specters

a mango struck the roof and
woke me i lay listening for it to
start rolling for a long time now i
had resented that huge mango tree
above the barracks as if its bombard-
ment of the roof at night were the ulti-
mate indignity of the conspiracy to de-
prive us of sleep what with jackals
howling and rats running through the
thatched roof and sometimes snakes
slithering on the beams and the eternal
bugs and the outrageous wet summer
heat there was enough to keep you
awake without a mango going through
its routine of dropping to the roof with
a bang rolling down the incline with
agonizing slowness and then the dull
plop when it finally hit the ground

  the routine paused unendurably
after the first stage my breath
waited for the mango to start rolling
light lay against my eyelids it was
day and outside some of the men were
calling to each other in shrill oddly im-
mature voices and nearby an engine
was warming but what about the
mango it should have rolled to hell
and back by now

  my arm flung out over the edge of
the cot and there was no mosquito net
to impede it i pried my eyes open
and saw a flat piaster ceiling and came
fully awake

  this wasnt india mosquito nets
were not considered essential on west
eighty-second street in new york
city under my window a car motor
sputtered and coughed and suddenly
caught and roared the shrill voices

of boys playing on the sidewalk moved
off again i heard the thump over-
head a second shoe probably drop-
ped by a night-shift worker going to
bed

  i dug my watch out from under the
crumpled pillow and saw that it was
past noon nine hours of sleep but i
felt unrested the process of getting
out of bed and dressing seemed com-
plicated and unnecessary this was
friday the beginning of my fourth day
in new york and seven million peo-
ple remained between myself and don
yard i had got no closer to him and
perhaps during this time the police
had got closer to me

  they were after me that was defi-
nite now there had been a single
paragraph deep inside yesterdays
world-telegram it had taken until
thursday for the news to reach new
york or more likely for the police to
be ready to name names all that those
few lines had said was that alexander
linn former air force lieutenant
who last week had been tried and ac-
quitted for the murder of his wife was
being sought in connection with the
murder of emil schneider in west
amber

   so the police were looking for me and
i was looking for a gambler named
don yard and a woman named bertha
kaleman and a man named walter
something a merry-go-round on which
the horses we sat on moved up and
down and not at all forward so far

t climbed out of bed and shed

  my pajamas on the way to the
shower this was a deluxe apartment
with a private bathroom and a tiny al-
cove containing a midget refrigerator
a chipped porcelain sink and a two-
burner gas range i could afford it
id reached new york with better than
two thousand dollars in cash and in


mammoth mystery

two sessions at downtown public poker
clubs id increased it by two hundred
dollars

  the shower was stinging cold i
came out of the bathroom dripping
and opened the package of shirts and
socks and underwear id bought last
night enough to keep me supplied for
a considerable stay if the police
would let me if i didnt happen to
run into anybody who knew me

  when i was dresssed i stuck a cig-
arette between my lips and went down-
stairs a lot more jauntily than i felt
mrs egan the oversized landlady
was poring over the mail on the long
mahogany table in the hall she glanced
sideways at me descending the stairs
and returned her attention to the let-
ers are you expecing mail mr ber-
kowitz she asked

  nobody was behind me or in the
hall i kept coming down mrs egan
gave me a sharp look doesnt any-
body write you mr berkowitz

  she meant me i was berkowitz-
jeffery berkowitz id had a score
of names since sunday morning and
id forgotten most of them tuesday
id used another one to register at this
rooming house since then i hadnt
seen mrs egan or been anywhere in
new york where it had been necessary
to give a name or be called by one so
it had eased out of my consciousness
this was a name i must not forget
this one must stick when people said
berkowitz or jeffery or jeff i had to
respond in a split-second the way i
did to linn or alexander or alec only
i mustnt respond at all to the names
id had since birth they were no
longer mine they were dangerous

  i clamped a grin on my face i
sent my folks this address only a couple
of days ago and theyre all the way
out in utah

  mrs egans vast bosom heaved

the way this war separates families
i havent heard from my boy peter in
three weeks i think i asked you when
you first came didnt you run across
my peter hes in the pacific some-
where-a sergeant in the air force in
the ground crew peter egan hes
only twenty but he looks-

  no maam i slipped in i was
an army private in the cbi theatre
isnt that in the pacific my peter
is somewhere-

  no maam cbi means china-
burma-india thats thousands of
miles from where your son would be
and i was in the infantry while hes
in the air force i moved past her

  mr berkowitz she said you told
me you were looking for a job mr
marcus in -c works in a radar place
in long island city he says theyre
looking for men to train and pay good
wages while they learn

  my hand turned the knob without
opening the door im seeing a man
in an advertising agency today thats
the line id like to get into i pulled
the door toward me

  i hope you get it mrs egan called
after me

  thanks

tt had turned cool in the first week
of september a pleasant breeze
swirled from central park it was a
nice street brownstone rooming houses
on this side swank apartment build-
ings on the other and even the boys
playing box-ball a few doors away were
somewhat subdued about it for boys
i started down the stoop and came
to an abrupt halt and twisted halfway
around almost i fled back into the
house a patrolman was coming down
the street peering at the numbers of
the brownstone houses he passed

  he was coming for me somehow
they had traced me
the spider lily



  i placed unsteady hands behind my
back and stood poised between free-
dom and doom my eyes only capable
of motion as they shifted in their
sockets to follow the inexorable ap-
proach of the cop somewhere along
the line id made a mistake some-
where along that cautious round-
about journey i had taken between
three am sunday and  am tues-
day the widely scattered links had come
together

  from west amber i had walked un-
til daylight the driver of a twelve-
wheel trailer gave me a lift he was
burning up the road to make buffalo
by evening i was bound there myself
but i left him at trevan and took a lift
southwest with a man in a tennessee
coupe that day i took twenty-three
short-hop lifts in all weaving toward
kochester five miles outside the
city i spent the night in a tourist cabin
next day monday six lifts brought me
to buffalo by noon i hung around
buffalo until evening and took a sleeper
to new york some time during the
night the train passed through west
amber in those two days i had not
used the same name twice

  the cop was on the sidewalk direct-
ly below me he looked up at me and
then went on toward columbus ave-
nue still studying house numbers for
whatever reason he had for doing it

  my insides fell back into place
soundless laughter quivered in my
throat the links remained scattered
i had time but time was all i had

  i walked to central park west and
turned south today wasjfriday and
the hale county weekly star came
out on wednesday it would have
reached new york by now if any
copies for sale reached new york
there were newsstands on times
square where i might get it

  shine em up mister

  he was a bright-looking black boy
of ten or twelve i leaned against a
building bounding columbus circle
and put a foot on his box

t f i were a cop and had a notion that
alec linn had come to new york
city would it occur to me to have news-
stands which sold out-of-town papers
watched on the chance that alec linn
would want to buy his local paper
the metropolitan papers had carried
nothing about the murder except for
those very few lines in the world-tele-
gram but the star would be full of it
where else could alec linn if he were
in new york get the information

  the polishing cloth gave a final flip
to the toe of my second shoe i handed
the boy a quarter and waved the
change aside howd you like to
earn a dollar i asked

  the bright black eyes regarded me
cautiously doing what

  do you know where theres a news-
stand which sells out-of-town papers
huh

  newspapers from other cities

  his gaze was openly suspicious
buy a paper for you for a buck mis-
ter

  look i said patiently im sure
you know where times square is
you bet forty-second street

  i wrote on a slip of paper an out-
of-town newsstand-the hale county
star then i said show this paper
to somebody on times square maybe
the first few people wont know but
keep showing it till somebody tells you
to go to a certain newsstand if he
has the newspaper hell sell it to you
i indicated a restaurant two doors
away ill be in there waiting for
you

  he kept his doubting eyes fixed on
me suppose you aint there when i get
back ill be out the price of the paper


mammoth mystery

and the carfare

  youll get ahead in life i told him
ill give you a dollar now and a dollar
when you come back

  he snatched the dollar from my hand
and scurried to the subway kiosk

  id eaten in that restaurant twice
before the plump waitress gave me
a dimpled nod i carried an old fash-
ioned from the bar to the table and
waited for my order and the return
of the shoeshine boy the afternoon
was ahead of me and the night and
days and nights after that yesterday
and the day before i had tried to get
to don yard through the only thing
we had in common besides the fact that
we had both been married to lily and
that was poker id played at two dif-
ferent poker clubs and had tried to
make conversation about gamblers
and slip don yards name in no
soap at the first club only a couple
of men had heard of him he wasnt
it appeared a terrific big shot at the
second club a swankier place id been
cut short twice by the house dealer be-
cause id held up the game with my
talking

  id got a response from only one man
-a tight-smiling tight-playing man
named locust i was present last
year when yard dropped thirty grand
on the cut of a card locust had said
of course that doesnt compare with
what arnold rothstein used to bet on a
card or win or lose in one night but
yard will never be a rothstein

  do you know yard well i asked
locust had shrugged delicately and
had turned to the dealer who was
growling at us and later locust had
slipped away before id had a chance
to speak to him in private

aty soup arrived i picked up the
spoon and put it down there
was a phone booth at the rear of the

restaurant and a pile of directories on
a shelf tuesday i had looked up don
or donald or d yard in the man-
hattan book and had drawn a blank
but manhattan wasnt all of new
york most of the population lived in
brooklyn or the bronx or queens or
staten island  why not a gambler

  i went t the booth and looked in
the other city directories more blanks
he might live in the suburbs or at a
hotel or have an unlisted number i
returned to my soup

  and if i found his number what
would i do about it i could hardly
ring him up on the phone or call on him
in person and say mr yard i am
alec linn you have no doubt heard
of me in connection with a recent un-
pleasantness up at west amber con-
cerning lily and news may already
have reached you of an even more re-
cent unpleasantness concerning one of
her lovers we should get together
we have a great deal in common we
are the two men who made legitimate
love to lily i need your help pos-
sibly you or bertha kalenan or a man
named walter or somebody else in your
circle is involved in the murders of
lily and schneider if so id like to
know please and if not do you or
any of the others have knowledge or
information which will help me find the
murderer i wili greatly appreciate
any cooperation you can give me in
this matter

  and don yard would throw me out
or turn me over to the police or kill
me because to him i was the murderer
myself in person of the woman he had
loved

  so there i was a fugitive in a res-
taurant in columbus circle with the
police of the nation looking for me to
burn me in an electric chair or shut
me away in a nuthouse and no weap-
ons to fight back with except what i
the spider lily



had inside my head well had i had
more in india when wed completed a
tough bombing run and gas was run-
ning low and ten men were depending
on my knowledge of navigation to take
them home even that last time when
wed got lost for a while and then
had to step out on a cloud id brought
them to where we could reach ground
with the loss of only one man and a
couple of others banged up ezra
bilkin was killed one out of eleven
when we might all have gone that way
id kicked myself around long enough
id done a good job bringing them back
at all id got a medal for it hadnt
i they dont hand out medals for
mistakes or failures unless youre a
lot higher up in the ladder than a first
lieutenant

  id done it once id brought ten
out of eleven men home against ter-
riffic odds i could bring myself home
now

t was up to my coffee and the shoe-
shine boy hadnt returned it
shouldnt have taken him more than
five minutes to get down to times
square ten to locate the newsstand and
buy the paper five minutes to return
call it thirty minutes in all and he
was already gone forty-five

  maybe they didnt have the star and
he decided to keep the dollar may-
be-

  panic hit me in the pit of the
stomach it twisted me in the chair
toward the door so i was smart i
was a brainy guy whod sent a strange
kid instead of going myjelf but if
the police were watching newsstands
which sold out-of-town papers theyd
check on everybody who bought the
star theyd compel the kid to take
them to me

  i beckoned to the waitress for the
check she was busy at another

table she displayed her dimples for
me but she did not come over

  and then he was coming in holding
the shoeshine box in one hand and the
paper under his other arm he wasnt
followed in but they might be out-
side waiting for him to point me out to
them

  he saw me at once here you are
mister he said and spread the paper
out in front of me on the table

  i almost jumped out of my skin
my face looked up at me from the
paper it was a two-column photo
beside one of emil schneider i was in
uniform wearing a careless smile and
an overseas cap at a ragish angle
to my knowledge the same photo had
appeared three times in the star-be-
for id been sent overseas after id
been indicted for the murder of lily
and now

   that it the boy asked anxiously

  sure i said fine i folded
the newspaper over my photo and
fumbled my wallet out

  the boys bright black eyes were
glued to the wallet he hadnt con-
nected me up with the photo i had
been hundreds of years younger when
it was taken and i had been in uni-
form and the stars halftones were
always blurred

  boy he said five bucks

  id taken out a five by mistake i
shoved it into his hand i just came
into a lot of money i explained
weakly youre a fine intelligent
boy and i want you to share a little
of it

  gee thanks mister he said
ecstatically and raced out of the
restaurant

   as soon as he was gone i regretted
having let him keep the five six dol-
lars was too much for a nickel news-
paper he would talk about it and re-
member the name of the paper i got


mammoth mystery

out of there as quickly as i could

j walked downtown on ninth
avenue where there was less
chance of meeting anybody who knew
me when i reached the middle fifties
i stopped beside a cigar store and read
the paper

  george winkler had called the turn
in fact the police had even more than
he had anticipated

  at dawn monday morning emil
schneider had been found on his porch
by the milkman who made deliveries
every other day saturday afternoon
schneider had bought a railroad ticket
to chicago and had told the station
agent that he planned to leave the fol-
lowing morning evidently it had been
a sudden decision for he hadnt had a
chance to tell the milkman to stop de-
liveries and give him a bill the medi-
cal examiner had established the time
of death as sometime saturday night
or sunday morning

  two  caliber bullets fired from
a medium power rifle had entered his
body

  there were witnesses-not to the
murder itself but they may as well
have been as far as the district attorney
was concerned

  first sheriff owen dowie on sat-
urday afternoon i had stopped to speak
to him on division street and had asked
questions about schneider and had
made certain statements which had im-
pressed him as having been threats
against schneider he had been suffi-
ciently worried by my attitude to have
warned me to keep away from the man
who had been my wifes lover

  and mr rosenberg about whom i
had completely forgotten at about
eight-thirty saturday evening i had
stopped at his house and inquired the
direction to schneiders house mr
rosenberg said that at the time he had

thought it odd that i would want to call
on my wifes lover but had given me
the information he had seen my car
turn up schneiders driveway

  finally oliver spencer-reluctantly
as the reporters put it but compelled
by a sense of duty the others at the
game-evidently masterson and dietz
hadnt been questioned-had tried to
keep quiet about it but when mr
spencer brought it out in the open
they were forced to string along mr
spencer was the only one to insist that
i had been frantic in my demand for
five thousand dollars in cash the
others merely said that id asked for
it and that when i hadnt got it id
joined the game and won it

  what had i waned the money for
mr spencer didnt know miriam
thought i had mentioned something
about needing a rest ursula was more
definite she stated that when she
had gone up to my room with the
money i had told her that i couldnt
face my fellow townsfolk and wanted
to get away where nobody knew me
so early that morning i had left she
didnt know where i hadnt told her
id been anxious to cut myself off from
everybody who had heard of the mur-
der and the trial

  district attorney hackett didnt be-
lieve her he said so in bold type
he said that i had planned to murder
schneider and know ing that i wouldnt
be able to get away with this one i
had prepared getaway money in ad-
vance he said that i had been des-
perate to get the money saturday night
becaue i had found out that schneider
was planning to slip out of my reach
in the morning he said that my flight
was an admission of guilt he said
that schneider was dead because a
soft-hearted jury had permitted a glib
new york lawyer tc turn it aside from
duty and let me to go free to kill again
the spider lily



  the police of three states were
hunting for me

  i rolled the newspaper up and car-
ried it as far as the corner and dropped
it into a waste can

chapter xv

the gamblers

tt was one of the better public clubs

  it had carpeting instead of the usual
battleship linoleum and the voices of
men were not boisterous in the air-con-
ditioned atmosphere at one corner
leather lounge chairs fanned out from a
tiny bar in another corner stood the
cashiers cage the rest consisted of
cane-bottom chairs and five tables cov-
ered with white cloths there were no
line sheets tacked on the wall no pool
tables in the rear no blackjack for
suckers this was strictly poker for
gentlemen

  only one table was working a mod-
erate-limit draw game i watched it
for a while then went to the bar

  willoughby the proprietor came to
my side to say hello he was the only
man there in formal clothes his thin
unbending frame and frozen face would
have made him a natural for a butlers
job i see you are back mr- he
let the pause hang delicately in the air

  berkowitz i said jeffery berko-
witz

  mr berkowitz of course he said
as if i had told him my name when i had
played there yesterday it is early
but there will be plenty of action soon
you do not care for drawf

  i prefer table stakes stud

  oh yes i remember if you will
make yourself comfortable for a little
while-

  do you expect locust today i
asked

you are a friend of mr locust

  no but i played with him yester-
day id like to come up against him
again

  mr locust is an excellent player
he may be here today he comes sev-
eral times a week

  who is he i said ive heard
his name before but i cant place it
mr earl locust is one of the auto-
mobile locusts he is well-known in
poker circles pardon me he started
to turn away

  i said does don yard ever come
here to play

  willoughbys thin body stood a trifle
straighter as he turned back to me
we do not permit professional gam-
blers in this club mr berkowitz

  im glad to hear that i said try-
ing to sound happy about it i suppose
you cant be too careful in a place like
this

  we protect our clientle mr berko-
witz he said and moved off to the
cashiers cage

  presently a couple of more stud
players arrived and with two shills and
the house dealer participating a table
stakes game was started it dragged
everybody played only cinches few
hands ran out to the last turn

j turned in my chair and saw earl
locust speaking to willoughby
they were cut out of the same pattern
those two though you could tell at a
glance that willoughby was the butler
and locust the master he wore a tan
summer garbadine suit and a cocoa-
brown garbadine hat and carried him-
self with careless urbanity he was
perhaps in his forties  his pinched
face was vigorously tanned but his
eyes were unhealthily tired and gray
ran in narrow streaks through his thin-
ning brown hair

  locust looked at me without expres-
sion then said something to willoughby


mammoth mystery

and looked at me again i sent him a
nod and he received it with a lift of the
corners of his mouth he slapped wil-
loughbys shoulder lightly and came to
the table

  how are you he asked me
fine i said i was hoping youd
show up i want revenge for some pots
you took from me yesterday

  he pulled up a chair and stacked his
chips you didnt do so bad berko-
witz 

  yesterday i hadnt mentioned my
name to anybody here that meant
that willoughby had told it to him
they had been discussing me

  the game stepped up outside
players took the chairs of the shills and
the dealer devoted himself wholly to
dealing action became brisk these
lads were skillful technicians and
shrewd psychologists and earl locust
was the best of them both he and i
were winners

  it was night when locust cashed in
his chips a minute later i did the
same he left while i was assemblig
the money into my wallet i shoved
wallet and loose money into a pocket
and hurried across the room and down
the short flight of stairs the street
was empty

  whats your hurry berkowitz
locust said

  he was standing in shadow against
the side of the doorway

 i-i- i drew in breath i
wasnt hurrying the fact is that ive
nowhere to go

  then how about some coffee

  i tried not to show my eagerness
good idea do you know any place
around here im pretty much of a
stranger

  he flagged a taxi we drove three
blocks and got out he cupped my el-
bow in him palm as if i were a woman
or a child and steered me into a cozy

little place with private booths he sat
back and regarded me quizzically

  tell me he said conversationally
when you tapped ito my open jacks
and drove me out did you hold any-
thing in the hole

  no

  he uttered a restrained pleased
laugh at tne time i could have sworn
you held queens thats a very nice
game of poker vou play

  thanks

  the coffee and sandwiches arrived
thoughtfully he stired the sugar in his
cup what are you after berkowitz
after i said

whats your interest in don yard
i wrapped my palms around the
warm cup i suppose willoughby
told you id asked him if yard came to
the club

  and that you questioned him about
me youre a stranger and you came to
the club for the first time yesterday
and you are an excellent player wil-
loughby is afraid you might be a pro-
fessional

  im not

  locust went on without a break
and yesterday you asked me questions
about don yard during the game per-
sonally i dont give a hang whether
or not youre a professional they play
a more exciting game than amateurs
but i asked you what youre after

t drank my coffee and set fire to a
cigarette and pulled an ashtray to-
ward me and looked around to see if
the waitress was bringing the second
cup id ordered i was i hoped a
portrait of a man making up his mind
locust waited patiently with his tired
eyes fixed on my face

  i want to play poker with don
yard i said

  why yard in particular

  not yard and not in particular
the spider lily



for three years ive been in the infan-
try one of the few american troops
fighting in burma five days ago i
came out of an army separation center
my home is in utah my father has a
string of filling stations all over the
state im the only child and the busi-
ness is waiting for me and so is the girl
im going to marry but here i am in
new york with no responsibilities as yet
and plenty of money my mother left me
a pile of securities which is in the hands
of a new york broker im not saying
i dont want to go home to utah and
marge and the business i do but
heres my chance for a fling for doing
for two weeks or a month what id
rather do than almost anything else
and thats play poker the real stuff
i mean the kind i thought i could
find in new york

  locust nodded check some men
take a drink or sports or drugs or wo-
men ill pass up ijie best of any of
that for top-notch poker but where
does yard come in

  im not sure ive been going to
poker clubs because i havent been able
to find anything else willoughbys is
the best of them but i object to the
house rake-off in the long run it puts
impossible odds against the player be-
sides you dont get the kind of action
im after i did very well tonight and
ended up with only three hundred dol-
lars i can find bigger games than that
in my home town thats where don
yard comes in we were discussing
gamblers one night at a bull session in
calcutta and don yards name came
up actually i dont know thing about
him except that where he is theres prob-
ably a big game

   and so you think you will get a real
play for your money with profession-
als

   thats it

  locust took a bite out of a ham

sandwich and chewed it before he
spoke why are the lambs so eager
for slaughter

  ive considered that i said but
i think i can hold my own against any-
body as for crooked gamblers card
mechanics ive been told that the real
big-shot gamblers dont go in for that
sort of thing they depend on their
skill and on percentages thats true
isnt it

ilte chewed some more in es-
sence yes and youre good enough
from what ive seen of your playing
there will be a game at my house to-
morrow night

  with yard i blurted

  he gave me that tired level stare

  what i mean is big-timers like
yard i added quickly the kind
of men id like to have my fling
against

  yard will be there locust said
its a quiet private game in my apart-
ment he studied what was left of his
sandwich were quite particular
about who participates

  oh

  i didnt have to act out disappoint-
ment i felt it all the way down to my

shoes

  abruptly locust discarded talk of
poker he had been an officer in the
last war he had spent a year in india
and had visited utah subtly he was
pumping me checking up on the story
id told him it was a good thing i had
chosen the cbi theater as the one in
which jeffery berkowitz had fought in
for i knew china and india and burma
and after our second year at college
kerry and i had spent the summer driv-
ing tractors on the farm of a classmate
in utah i passed locusts exam with
flying colors

  we were finished eating before he re-
turned to poker you strike me as a


mammoth mystery

decent sprt of chap i can understand
exactly how you feel pokers in my
blood too i can invite you to tomor-
rows game my recommendation will
satisfy the other players

  would you i said eagerly
  those are fairly steep games

  my face fell i hope to win but i
cant possibly afford to lose more than
twenty thousand dollars

  locust laughed youve been lis-
tening to wild tales this is a friendly
game the stakes are only a thousand
dollars eah we usually settle with
checks but i suggest that you as a
newcomer bring cash

t-te was already there when i ar-
rived at locusts apartment on
madison avenue at a glance i picked
were in the oak-and-leather study
him out of the four strange men who
where the game was to be played

  a squat broad man schneider had
told me but don yard was not par-
ticularly short the effect was pro-
duced by the disproportionate breadth
of his shoulders which provided a
proper base for a beefy neck under an
unruly mop of dark hair his face was as
wide and craggy as a clenched fist he
exuded physical power like a bull a
wide and craggy as a clenched fist he
was a lot older than i at least twice my
age

  his handshake was not hearty when
earl locust introduced us it was bone-
crushing pressure applied and instantly
relaxed his incisive brown eyes un-
der shaggy overhanging brows slid
quickly over me

  ive seen you before he said

  my breath caught how could i
know that he hadnt been among that
blur of indistinguishable faces behind
me during the trial

  ive been in new york only six days
since my childhood i told him

  i guess lots of guys look alike he
muttered and lost interest in me

  locust cupped my elbow and led me
to the three other men they accepted
me without comment and almost no
conversation we sat down at the table
and bought chips from locust who as
the host was banker the others
bought on the cuff but i conspicu-
ously paid my thousand dollar stack
in cash

  the game was table stakes draw i
had heard that on rare occasions it was
played but i never before participated
in one it was murder my thousand
dollars melted away

  i didnt know whether the three other
players were professionals like yard or
wealthy amateurs like locust but i
was sure there wasnt anything crooked
cards couldnt be marked in any way i
couldnt spot and i had taught myself
to recognize and duplicate all the tricks
of card mechanics nothing like that
was being pulled here the cards didnt
fall right for me or i was being out-
played these players werent ursula
or oliver spencer or art masterson
this was the big league

  i was halfway through my second
stack of chips when a man and a woman
came in yard greeted the woman as
baby and the other men called her
bertha the man with her they called
walt he pulled up a chair to the right
of me and bought chips

  this was my lucky night if not at
cards here were all three of them
the first stage of my search was ended

  walter was the man who had been
at the roadhouse with helen spencer
and don yard and lily and again at
the bungalow when yard hit oliver
spencer a long face that was like a
blank wall helen had described him
that was adequate add a chin like a
spade to it and dull little eyes which
showed as much emotion as a dead
the spider lily



mans he didnt have to change his
face for poker

gertha kaleman had hair of
flame it was too good to be nat-
ural she reminded me of lily because
of that same brittle polish and that way
of wearing a dress so that you were
aware of every movement of her body
she had plenty of body she was big-
ger than lily had been taller and
fuller but lily had been beautiful
where bertha kaleman only stepped
up your blood pressure

  she was sitting next to don yard
looking at his cards her eyes lifted
and caught me appraising her her red
mouth threw me a sensuous smile
dont i know you she said

  not do i know you meaning i
dont know you and please introduce
yourself dont i know you-as
if mine was a face seen and lost among
many other faces could she have been
at the trial with yard no helen who
had met them both would have recog-
nized them and told me i was fright-
ening myself with shadows formed of
words

  id never have forgotten you if wed
met i said

  locust mumbled a belated introduc-
tion

  berkowitz she said leaning her
arms on the table i bet your friends
call you berky

  anything you call me is music i
said

  look the boy is gallant she said

  shut up and lets play don yard
growled	-

  on the next deal i caught a flush on
a draw and tapped into walter who
was holding three eights a player
named judson turned up a straight
and i made myself a nice pot

  but it was the last i won for a long
time my stack was sinking danger-

ously low and i had only a few hun-
dred dollars left in my pocket i
played as tightly as i could but that
wouldnt do it there was too little
money between myself and disaster

  because if i dropped all my money
here i was through i could support
myself by getting a job any job but
i had no more taste for being a fugi-
tive indefinitely than for burning in
the chair or rotting in jail or going mad
in a madhouse i had to have money
to remain in contact with don yard
and bertha and walter there was no
way i could do it except through poker
i was in now i was one of them id
be invited to other games in which
yard played but not if i was broke
not if i had a job where i would not
make enough in a month to participate
in a single one of these pots

  there was one way to get a stake
the ethics of it i could take in stride
these men were gamblers or rich and
could afford to contribute to my at-
tempt to regain my life but it was
highly dangerous it wouldnt be an
exhibition before friends to show how
clever i was with cards these men
knew all the tricks you had to be
better than good to fool them better
than perfect

rjhe deck was three deals away from
me i sweated those deals out
throwing my hand in as soon as i
glanced at it walter on my right
brought out a new deck for his deal
i had two high pairs but i went out
and raked in the discards and washed
them there was some hot action be-
tween a man named silver and yard
and locust so that nobody paid at-
tention to me shuffling and reshuffling
the discards

  yard won i scooped up the remain-
ing deck and shuffled some more

  come on deal judson said do


mammoth mystery

you want to wash the spots off them
i placed the deck before locust on
my left he cut it only in two as he
generally did id banked on that i
dealt the way i always did rapidly
yard said whats the rush

  i stopped a vein pounded in my
temple whats that i asked

  take it easy yard said we
like the cards dealt slow

   i forced a grin to the surface oh
sure i said and continued to flick
the cards out

  i sank back a little when the round
was dealt i didnt have to look at my
cards there were three queens i
knew that a man named smollens was
holding three aces and silver two high
pair the other hand had fallen any
way they had come up

  locust must have bought some-
thing good he opened strong smol-
lens was enthusiastic about his three
aces and raised silver tagged along
with his two pairs yard looked at his
cards and then across the table at me
and folded so did judson and walter
i shoved in my stack the three who
were in saw me

  on the draw i dealt the cards
straight except to myself i gave myself
a full house none of the others helped
the pot was mine

  as i leaned forward to pull in the
chips my eyes tilted up to yards
craggy face he was watching me
flatly without expression my heart
skipped a couple of beats he said
nothing there was talk between smol-
lens and silver about how neither of
them had been able to fill all night
locust was gathering up the cards
the game continued i had my stake

  the gods of chance are not con-
cerned with morals from that deal
on i won at four oclock in the morn-
ing i walked out with eleven thou-
sand dollars in cash and checks

chapter xvi

don yard

    alter was waiting for me on
madison avenue he said tone-
lessly around the corner

  both hands were thrust deep into the
pockets of his jacket he had a gun
in one of those hands or he would have
been more polite i looked up the
street and then down the street at
that hour it was quiet enough to hear
myself breathe

  whats around the corner i said
  don he wants to see you

  we walked side by side to the end of
the block and turned right a snappy
sedan stood twenty feet down from the
corner bertha kaleman sat behind
the wheel she said pleasantly
hello berky

  the back door on the curb side
opened get in kid don yard said
out of the back seat darkness

  i sat beside him walter followed
me climbing over yards feet and
mine and sat at my left bertha had
the front seat to herself probably the
first time in her life she was left sitting
alone when there were men around
she drove west to sixth avenue then
south then west again nobody said
anything i wondered why i wasnt
more scared a week ago i would have
tightened up and started to sweat and
shake now i was chiefly curious

 between tenth and eleventh
avenues bertha stopped the car

  lets have the dough kid don
yard said crisply

  they were shadows on either side of
me their thighs pressing against mine
past berthas left shoulder i saw the
brightness of the hudson river speed-
way they could find better spots to
kill a man

  so its a holdup i said
the spider lily



  youre too smart for your pants
yard said you used the haymarket
shuffle to give yourself that queen-
high full

  i laughed the effect sounded all
right to me just about enough deri-
sion why didnt you expose me dur-
ing the game

  i had no dough in the pot theres
more in it for me this way

  youre crazy i said that was
an honestly dealt hand why didnt
any of the others notice anything
wrong

  bertha twisted around putting her
knees up on the seat and facing us
walt did you notice the deal was
phoney

  i wasnt watching

  i was bertha said i didnt see
him hold any fingers at the bottom of
the deck

  hes smart yard said damn
smart quick as lightning but im
smarter i was brought up on the hay-
market shuffle and i know when cards
drop at the same time from the top and
bottom of the deck even if he doped
out a new grip locust only cut the
deck once which made it snap for a
good mechanic to stack them and
look how the cards fell just right for
him he turned his shadowed face
to me youre lucky im taking only
the dough and leaving your health

tt was my lucky night all right

  whether i gave up the money or
didnt my contact with don yard
and walter and bertha was over almost
before it started oh i was smart as
hell

  walter said indifferently take a
look at this kid the overhead
light flashed on and off there was a re-
volver on his knee

  you win i said i dug the roll of
bills and checks out of my hip pocket

but two thousand dollars of that was
money i started with you saw me buy
two stacks you can have the rest
ill take it all yard said he took
it all

  there are checks made out to my
name

  dont let that worry you yard
pushed the door open scram mug
if i ever see you around again youll
be a mighty sick crook

  i rose in a crouch to step over his
feet bertha reached a hand over the
back of the seat and put it on my arm
wait she said don youre a
dope

that so yard said indifferently
sit down berky she ordered me
i squeezed myself back between
the two men a match flared yard
brought it up to his cigar by its light
i saw the money in his lap

  youre throwing away a gold mine
bertha said those men tonight
werent babes in the woods how
come none of them spotted a phoney
deal walts eagle eyes didnt you
said it yourself don-he pulled cards
from the top and bottom at the same
time like greased lightning could you
do it as well

  yard grunted the tiny glow at the
end of his cigar made his face look like
the side of a mountain seen at dusk

  i bet you watched him pretty close
after you spotted that trick deal she
went on

  what do you think

  did you catch him at any other
there werent any more a note
of interest slipped into yards voice i
think i get it baby

  she tossed her hair which had turned
black in the dimness of the car its
about time berky was the big winner
tonight and most of his pots came when
he wasnt dealing hes got to be
mighty good to win from you sharks


mammoth mystery

and just look at him did you ever
see anybody nicer-looking i mean
clean and young like he doesnt know
what day of the week it is if he can
take you like he did tonight what do
you think he can do to suckers and
you want to throw it away for a few
crummy grand

  shes got something there walter
said the kids born sucker-bait
they were settling it all between
themselves i might have been part of
the upholstery for all my opinion
counted that was all right with me

  yard gave me a faceful of cigar
smoke i thought id seen you
around who are you kid

  locust must have explained to yard
and the other players who i was when
he had told them he had invited me
i repeated the story

  when i finished yard said lets
see your discharge papers

  that was the basic weakness of my
new identity i told him that id
mailed them to my father in utah

  like hell you did yard said
you carry those on you all the time
what are you hiding kid

j was silent waiting for one of them
to suggest it bertha did she
had enough brains for herself and the
two men dishonorable discharge
she said he was kicked out of the
army

  i dropped my head i tore them
up i said wearily they werent
the kind id want to show it was the
same thing as happened tonight id
been winning a lot in barracks games
and the army rang in an expert on
mechanics he spotted me and i was
sent home i havent a rich father and
no securities in my name all i had
left was twenty-five hundred bucks aft-
er blowing the rest away between india
and here i dont know anything but

cards and i tried to get in on the big-
time with guys like you i was hitting
the bottom of my stake and got scared
id be cleaned out so i pulled that one
fancy deal i spread my hands
there it is

  they liked that story it made us
kindred souls they could understand
a lad like thst and know how to work
with him an honest man would have
been hazardous

  yard removed his cigar from his
mouth see me tomorrow maybe
i can use you

  i tapped the roll on his lap what
about my dough

 yours he chuckled dryly
then he decided that that wasnt the
right tactic if he was to use me ill
take care of it till tomorrow make it
at two he told me a number and a
street in greenwich village now beat
it

  i climbed out over his feet he fol-
lowed me out and got in the front seat
with bertha she raised a red-tipped
hand to me and drove off

rjhe house was on the far side of
ninth avenue it was a hundred-
year-old tenement which had been torn
up inside and rebuilt and the shell had
been covered with a veneer of gray
brick don yard occupied the street
floor he had an entrance all to him-
self under the side of the stoop

  i wondered why a man who won and
lost thousands in one night would live
in a dump when i was inside i
saw an apartment which would have
looked good on top of park avenue
the rooms were immense the walls
were hand-troweled light-green plaster
the living room rug was a pomegranate-
red persian with a grayish-green bor-
der the furniture was subdued
modern heavy drapes fortified by
venetian blinds barred the vulgar eyes
the spider lily



of passersby from the street-level win-
dows it was a sunny afternoon but
soft indirect lights were on twilight
gloom would always prevail in these
rooms which wouldnt matter to people
who did most of their sleeping in day-
light

  it was five minutes after two when
walter answered my ring bertha wore
a black chiffon negligee which obviously
was all between u and her lush flesh
her long flame hair was a shawl over
her shoulders she gave me a hand to
shake and a smile to absorb

  yard sat in a semi-circle of sunday
papers scattered around his armchair
powder-blue pajamas were covered by
a red silk robe which hung open in
front his jowls were dark with stubble
he threw me a curt nod and dropped
his eyes back to the sports section

  i advanced to the edge of the papers
at his feet before i hear your propo-
sition i said i want my money
back

 you stole it lie muttered without
looking up from the paper

  only a small part of it and not from
you or walter i said you two were
out of that hand the rest i won fair
and square

  walter was at my side i hadnt
heard him move over the rug his
hands were deep in his jacket pockets
should i throw him out don he
asked lazily

 well see yard dropped the
paper to the floor and put his
head against the back of the chair
you had a good nights sleep and now
youre feeling your oats is that it
kid

  ive had time to think it over if
thats what you mean im willing to
work with you but first i want my
money

  bertha undulated around me and sat
on the arm of yards chair one of her

nicely rounded thighs showed she
didnt cover it the boy has spirit
she said

  yeah negligently yard pulled
the negligee over the exposed thigh
then looked up at me through half-
closed lids

  so you heard about me in india
from a former newspaper reporter
during a bull session i dont remem-
ber his name

  what did you hear

  that you were one of the top
gamblers in new york something like
that it was indefinite

  it was so indefinite that you came
to new york looking for me he said
you went around asking about me
i suppose locust told you
yeah

rjhis was my opening i said as
a matter of fact id forgotten
about you until a couple of days ago
i picked up a paper in the subway
there was one of those full-page
feature spreads about a murder an
air force navigator had been tried
for the murder of a woman named
daisy-i think that was her name-
and it said in the paper that youd
once been married to her

  when i stopped speaking i felt a
vacuum of silence bertha glanced at
yard and then away yards eyes had
opened all the way in a stare that
smoldered

  lily walter said softly at my
side

  thats it lily i said i knew
it was a flower

  yards eyes closed what was the
name of the paper i didnt see any-
thing about me in any paper

  it wasnt a new york paper i
said new jersey or maybe con-
necticut i forget then somebody
else was murdered the lover of- i


mammoth mystery

stopped out of apparent delicacy for
her former husbands feeling

  go on yard urged me quietly
what else did the paper say

  the police are looking for the navi-
gator hed been found innocent of

lilys murder but-

  yard sat erect he wasnt inno-
cent he was acquitted thats all
howd they get my name into it it
wasnt brought in at her trial

  my bluff hand was being called but
it was unlikely that he would take
the trouble to check up on every paper
in new york and connecticut and new
jersey to see if id lied he would not
think that there was any reason for me
to lie

  i guess youre something of a public
character i said everything about
you comes out sooner or later but
i was telling you how i came across your
name a second time what made me
read that story was a picture of your
former wife lily she was something
to look at she had all the pin-up
girls i ever saw beaten hollow a storm
was gathering in his craggy face i
stirred it up i suppose a man like
you whos got a swell girl like bertha
wouldnt care if another man took lily
away from you but i know if i had a
girl like her-

  his beefy neck was as red as berthas
hair he leaped to his feet i started
to duck to avoid the blow i thought i
saw coming but he only dropped his
powerful right hand on my shoulder and
squeezed then he shoved me aside
and strode out of the room

  he still loved lily even now that
she was dead bertha was only a sub-
stitute for her

  bertha slipped off the arm of the
chair her head was dipped so that i
could not clearly see her face she
went to a cigar stand and took a ciga-
rette out of a hammered silver box and

set fire to it with a table lighter

   i turned to walter who stood regard-
ing me with his dull little eyes what
did i say i asked

  too damn much

  you mean what i said about his
former wife who was murdered i
get it he still cares for her
you talk to damn much walter
said

j started toward bertha whose
back was to me don yard re-
turned before i reached her his color
was high and his eyes bright that must
have been a pretty stiff drink he had
gone for

  he said briskly keep out of my
personal life kid and well get along
here is the deal i stake you and you
get ten percent of the winnings
twenty-five percent i said
bertha emitted a low giggle berky
is all right don you dont scare
him

  he sent her an annoyed scowl and
for a moment i was afraid she had
queered it for me but he shrugged
and said fifteen percent well see
how you do on that theres a game
tonight at the hotel tannor room
 be there at nine

  what kind of game

   whatever kind of poker they ask for
and whatever stakes they set those
heels will play high they all have
plenty of dough in their pants and ask-
ing for somebody to iake it away i
wont be there because im too well
known if anybody asks you tell them
the first story you told us about being a
returned soldier with rich folks in
utah and so much dough you dont
know what to do with it walt will be
playing and handling the kitty its
okay to know him but only because he
steered you up to the game youre
a sucker like the others
the spider lily



  a house man for a floating game
i said that suits me what happens
when i lose

  you dont get your fifteen percent
lose too much and it wont pay me to do
business with you win a lot and ill
raise your percentage one corner
of yards mouth lifted the idea kid
is not to lose

  he left it at that i had been afraid
that he wanted me solely for my ability
as a mechanic that would have put me
on the spot one rigged deal had been
enough to last me for the rest of my
life yard was not a crook he was a
business man who made investments
with the odds in his favor he didnt
care how i won as long as i won and he
made his eighty-five percent of the
profits he was right up there with
the captains of high finance

  then its set i said except that
you havent yet returned the money you
took from me last night

  yard went out of the room and re-
turned with a roll it wasnt my roll
there werent any checks in it our
agreement started an of last night he
said you get your two grand back
and fifteen percent of the rest any
more arguments

  i had none he handed me thirty-
three hundred and some odd dollars and
walter conducted me to the street door

jpour of the five strangers in the
hotel room were visitors to new
york who yearned for a fling at big-
city poker they were top-notch play-
ers in their home towns but not quite
adequate for a floating game organ-
ized by professional some won and
some lost but both walter and i won
honestly i ended lip with three thou-
sand dollars ahead walter with seven
hundred dollars not counting the kitty
for playing host a fair nights work

  i waited for walter a couple of

blocks away he picked me up in a
taxi and we rode downtown to settle
accounts with the boss between the
seventies and fourteenth street not
a word passed between us he wasnt
a lad who worked his face except when
essential even when sitting his hands
remained in his pockets as if to hide
them or warm them or hold onto some-
thing out of sight

  why did don get sore at me when
i mentioned his former wife i said
suddenly

  he wasnt sore at you the words
came out of the corner of the long wide
mouth the face remained turned to the
side window

  then what was he sore about
keep your trap shut about lily
don strikes me being a pretty hard
guy i persisted

  yeah

  then why did he let another man
take her away from him why didnt
he go after her if he cared so much
for her

  his face swivelled to me let it
lay kid

  i only asked-

   let it lay

  the taxi pulled up at the gray-brick
house no light showed through the
venetian blinds walter pressed the
bell-button once when there was no
answer he fished out a keyring

  do you live with don i asked
ive got a place up in the bronx
but i bunk here sometimes

  a dim bulb glowed in the long hall
at the end of it was a back door lead-
ing out into a yard-the privilege of
living on street-level he waved to the
living room on my left wait in there
ill wake him up

  i found the wall-switch and clicked
it a pre-dawn hush seeped into the
house from the street i crossed the 
room and took a cigarette from the


mammoth mystery

hammered silver box there was a
bleached oak desk against the far wall
i had perhaps a minute to search it
what for it was only in stories that
there would be a letter from lily say-
ing if you dont send me ten grand
at once ill tell the police all i know
so you better pay up or my hus-
band is coming home any day now
probably this weekend so dont come
sucking around me any more youre
too jealous for a girl to live with alec
is a hick and a dope but hes nice and
maybe ill like it with him if you
dont let me alone ill tell him when he
gets back

  all right-fantastic so were any
other ideas i had which would work
don yard into my equation here i
was marking time with great vigor and
getting nowhere in a hurry

rjhe cry wasnt loud not the first
one the second was shriller more
urgent

  i started toward the hall door and
then reversed myself the door in the
back wall of the living room led di-
rectly into the other rooms i went
through it and found myself in dark-
ness except for light shining through a
door at the other end the lighted
room was a small study and to the left
of it was the master bedroom

  bertha kaleman had both hands
against walters chest and was trying
to push herself away from him his
arms were about her waist and his
spade-chin was frantically nuzzling her
bare shoulder

  cut it outl i said

  walter released her his long face
was very pale his eyes had something
in them now-glittering feverish lights

  beat it he panted

  agitatedly bertha pulled up the
shoulderstrap of her yellow nightgown
she had just gotten out of bed but the

layer of paint was smooth and precise
on her face the toenails of her bare
feet were scarlet never mind
berky she said jerkily don will
kill him when he comes home
walter thrust his hands into his poc-
kets he was trembling and i wasnt
that was good to know

   beat it he said again

  i watched his hands if he had a
gun in either of those pockets what
would i do this was absurd unneces-
sary i hadnt come to new york to
be killed to protect what honor the
mistress of a gambler had but here i
was stuck with the situation i waited

  bertha said hoarsely if you touch
berky ill tell don i swear i will
yeah the blankness had whip-
ped back into his face his dead eyes
looked at her and then at me he went
out through the other door the one lead-
ing into the hall i listened to him en-
ter the living room

  you were swell berky bertha
said hes been waiting for a chance
at me for a long time that guy gives
me the willies

  there wasnt much to that yellow
nightgown of hers little purple forget-
me-nots were scattered over it and at
the edge of the very low bodice was
embroidered forget me not cute
as hell i could have thought of a more
apt slogan

  she looked dowa at herself and
brought her palms up over her breasts
why im practical y naked she said
with a girlish giggle

  dont mind me i said

  she took one hand from herself to
pat my cheek youre sweet berky
the she ducked into the bedroom

t returned to the living room

  walter had placed a bottle and
glasses on the white coffee table how
about a snorter he asked almost ami-
the spider lily



ably

  i shook my head

  he poured a short one and then said
angrily what the hell can you expect
when i meet her walking out of her
room in only that yellow stuff shes
always like that she drives a guy nuts
you dont have to make anything of
it

  why should i was lily like that
too was that why she and don-

  the blank stare he gave me cut me
off why do you keep bringing up
lily

  i laughed probably too lightly i
guess that newspaper account i read
about her murder made me curious

  well dont be he sat down at
the coffee table and pulled a pocket
chess set out of his inside breast pocket
do you play kid theres no telling
when don will get back

   i bit off the automatic reply that rose
to my lips alec linn was a chess
player never could get into it i
said poker is my only game

  he set up a simple problem it gave
him trouble after a while he looked
up the way you ask about lily
sometimes i think maybe youre a cop

  why would you be afraid of a
cop

  the empty stare lay flatly on me
youre too dumb to be a cop except
youre smart in poker and you play
that too good for a cop and he moved
the rook to kbs instead of to kb
which would have been proper

  don yard arrived with the dawn he
was counting out my fifteen percent
when bertha came in she was wear-
ing the black negligee over the yellow
nightgown her flame hair hung down
to her waist she looked very good
what was it about unhandsome heels
like don yard that could get women
like lily and bertha

  then i noticed walter crouching

over the chess set he might merely
have been studying the problem but
there was tension in the arc of his
shoulders and his jutting jaw was
ridged he was afraid of yard and
afraid of what bertha could do to him
through yard

  she ignored him she went over to
yard and pecked his cheek howd
berky make out tonight

  yard patted her hip not bad
three grand

  i told you he would dont be long
don good-night berky she undu-
lated out of the room

  walters body loosened he sat
back that was that i took my cut
of the winnings and went home

chapter xvii

pursuit of an equation

rjphat week there were three more
floating games in hotel rooms i
did tfery well in one and fair in the
two others but i got nowhere at all in
the real purpose behind my playing i
saw don yard only at the pay-offs and
then briefly tackling walter i had
learned was a waste of breath if not
hazardous bertha kaleman seemed
to be my best bet but i couldnt get
her off by herself twice i phoned
the unlisted number to ask her out to
lunch the first time there was no an-
swer the second time i hung up as
soon as i heard yards voice over the
wire

  on a tuesday two weeks after i hit
new york i accepted earl locusts in-
vitation to take part in one of the mur-
derous table stakes draw games he
held in his study yard and walter
wouldnt be there they were busy on
another project of theirs i knew noth-
ing about this was extra-curricular
winning or losing my own money as


mammoth mystery

it turned out losing

  the game was an hour old when
robin magee came in

  i suppose it was inevitable if not
magee it would have been somebody
else new york is immense but even
an out-of-towner like myself was always
bumping into acquaintances i tried
to protect myself by keeping off the
street as much as possible and depend-
on taxis for transportation and now
here was robin magee regarding me
with that silky smile of his

  locust rose from the table and in-
troduced him to two players magee had
not met before then it was my turn
mac i want you to meet jeff berko-
witz who took us to the cleaners last
game we had up here he plays a mean
poker jeff shake hands with robin
magee the noted criminal lawyer
we shook hands i doubt if there
was any blood in mine we looked in-
to each others eyes magee broadened
his smile and sat down beside me the
game resumed

  id been due for a streak of bad
cards it had started before magees
arrival and the fact that he was now
sitting beside me didnt help my play-
ing i tightened up supporting only
cinches and was lucky to get away
with a loss of only a couple of thou-
sand dollars or a couple of grand
as i was beginning to think of such an
amount

xhen the game ended magee and
i left together we walked a
a full block in the early morning quiet
before either of us spoke then magee
chuckled

  berkowitz thats a little master-
piece who would think of alexander
linn as berkowitz or the other way
around

  what do you propose to do about
it i said

  the chuckle died he stopped walk-
ing and i stopped and we stood against
a wall two shadows beyond the sickly
rim of the nearest street light

  im in a difficult position my boy
he said somberly my clients would
lose confidence in me if i were to turn
a former client of mine over to the po-
lice though-you are wanted for an
entirely different murder than the one
for which i defended you the fact re-
mains that i was recently consulted
concerning this second case

  by george winkler

  he came to my office last week with
miriam hennessey

  how is she

  not well winkler told me later
that she is eating her heart away i
feel sorry for that poor girl a hard-
ened cynic like me cannot understand
why women are always falling irrevoc-
ably in love with the men who hurt
them most

  a milk wagon cluttered leisurely by
the horse appeared to be asleep on its
feet

  miriam doesnt love me like that
i muttered

  my boy you are as blind as a bat
if you really think that it was plain to
me in every word she said later when
i had a private talk with winkler he
said that if you had had an iota of
sense you would have married miriam
in the first place and avoided all this
trouble

  the milk wagon turned into third
avenue the street was empty now
except for the two of us standing
against the wall

  i suppose theres no use telling you
i didnt kill schneider i said

  he shrugged his aristocratically
stooped shoulders i am a defense at-
torney not a prosecutor or a juror
winkler and miriam came to new york
to consult me as to your chances if you
the spider lily



were caught or gave yourself up frank-
ly i would not give one chance in ten
to your being acquitted this time i
believe however that i can get you
committed to an institution

   i prefer the chair to a nuthouse 
   then youll get it

  im not giving myself up i said
fiercely im fighting

  he looked searchingly at me though
he could not see more than an outline
of my face they tell me you are an
intelligent young man but you havent
impressed me as such not before and
during your trial and certainly not now
is this a rational way to hide out going
about openly in new york and partici-
pating in big poker games when the
police are aware of your reputation as
a poker player

  im looking for the murderer

  in new york

pvidently locust hadnt told
him that id met don yard through
him and probably nobody but walter
and bertha knew that i was working for
yard let him keep thinking that i
was playing poker as the only way i
had to make a living while in hiding

  im working on an equation i mut-
tered some of the terms might be
found here

  terms

  for the hypotheses of a linear equa-
tion which i hope will tell me who mur-
dered lily and schneider of course
it cant be strictly mathematical there
cant be fixed values but if i can find
the right terms and thensatisfy the
equation-

  magee said im sure that i can
persuade a jury to find you psychologi-
cally irresponsible this time well
bring in experts to testify

  what id said about equation hadnt
gone through his ears i was a crack-
pot raving wildly a psychoneurotic in

an advanced stage we were back where
wed started from weeks ago there
was no common meeting ground noth-
ing i could say which he would under-
stand or believe

  look i said im going to start
walking away from here will i have
to worry about the police coming after
me

   for a long minute he was a motionless
and silent shadow against the wall
then he said i cannot afford to be
known as an attorney who hands his
clients over to the police i can only
urgently advise you to give yourself up
there are ways of getting you out of a
mental institution after a period of
time

  everything emptied out of me for
the first time it struck me that he and
all the others could be right i was mad
and had murdered two people without
remembering or not a murderer and
not completely insane but sufficiently
cracked to stake my life on an equation
which was not mathematics or psychol-
ogy or anything else in the books

  ill be glad to accompany you to a
police station magee said gently

  i turned and walked away from him
in the breaking dawn i found myself
at the east river i turned back to the
west men and women were leaving
for work when i climbed the stoop of
mrs egans rooming house

tn the winter we needed blankets

  and moved in from the front porch
and its protecting canopy to one of the
three rooms into which our hut was di-
vided but the straw ticks continued
to smell of mold and there were the
little indefinable sounds which might be
a scorpion crawling into your boots or
a snake slithering inside or outside the
wall just before sundown kassim
my bearer had bashed in the head of
a deadly krait which had been within


mammoth mystery

a yard of my leg he had grinned de-
lightedly as he had held it up by its
tail bas he had said finished
meaning not the snake but me if he
kassim hadnt been quick enough

  i kicked the blanket off me winter
or summer india was no place for
sleeping i turned on my side and
there was a woman in bed with me i
smiled this was what i had needed
all along i stretched out a hand to her
it froze in horror her hair consisted
of peculiarly colorless kraits squirming
toward me the woman looked along
her white passionate body and laughed
at my terror and her face was lilys
face

   i tried to roll off the bed but i could
not move medusa turned her victims
to stone i lay with eyes closed on the
damp sheet waiting for lily to dip her
head closer and let the snakes get their
venom into me i heard her stir i
felt her hot flesh along my arm as she
bent lower to bring the snakes into
range i screemed soundlessly and with
a vast effort twisted my head to her

  the snakes were gone her hair was
hair now but it was not the platinum
of lilys hair it was black and very
long and it lay spread over burnished
tan flesh without quite covering it
intense black eyes searched my face
the wide mouth was partly open-a
mouth to be kissed

  miriam  i cried joyfully

  there would be no snakes in mir-
iams hair nothing to hurt me i reached
out my arms for her and suddenly i
was alone tossing in my bed in mrs
egans rooming house the sheet under
me was damp a high hot sun poured
in through the window and over my face
and body

  my watch said two-thirty it was
afternoon but i hadnt slept enough
it was a long time since sleep had rested
me i turned my face away from the

sun and closed my heavy lids

jphere was a knock on the door

i got out of bed rubbed my eyes
with my knuckles and then scratched
my back the knock was repeated i
went to the door and asked who it was
bertha -
who i said stupidly

  bertha kaleman is there any rea-
son why i cant be invited in

  i turned the key and started to turn
the knob before i realized that i wasnt
in proper attire to receive sleekly turned
out female company wait a minute
i said im not dressed

  the unlocked door was opening i
dont mind she said and came all the
way in she looked me over why
the fuss youre wearing pajamas
it covers more than a sheer yellow
nightgown with forget me not em-
broidered on the bosom i said

  i see you havent forgotten

  do you think i could

  she patted my face with a white
gloved hand youre cute berky
no wonder ive fallen for you

  i didnt say anything she strolled
by me to the dresser her hat was
built like a layercake the bottom layer
black and the top and smaller one royal
blue her black dress was also in tiers
the material folding out from her ade-
quate hips and twice again before the
hem at the slashed bosom there was
another tier but that wasnt the design
of the dress that was bertha

  arent you glad to see me berky
she said into the dresser mirror she
was removing the layercake gingerly
to preserve the complicated hairdo

  it might be a prudish upbringing
but i was taught to entertain women
with my clothes on at least in the early
stages

she smiled brightly into the mirror
i gathered up my clothes and carried
the spider lily



them into the bathroom

  when i came out her handbag and
gloves were beside the layercake on the
dresser she stood at the window look-
ing down into eighty-second street i
went to her side

  sorry i and the room are such a
mess i said i wasnt prepared for
company

  i dropped in for a moment to ask
if youd like to see a musical tonight
high feathers somebody gave don
four tickets he was going to give two
to walt but walt has no girl friends
so i suggested that we take you don
said all right

  and he sent you up here to tell me
i imagine he assumed id phone
you

  but you didnt you came in per-
son

  this time the hand was placed on my
chest the full painted mouth was
surprisingly close i didnt know it
was going to be a kiss until it was an
accomplished fact her hands slid up
under my armpits i held her tight
she felt very good after a while i
found myself looking at the artificial
lashes at the edge of exotically dark-
ened eyelids and i told myself that i
mustnt like it too much i must use
it but not let it run away with me

t took my mouth and the rest of me
away from her and went to the dres-
ser and lighted a cigarette through
the mirror i saw her undulate after me
the cigarette was plucked from my
fingers she brought it to where a
smear of lipstick ruined the corner of
her mouth

  whats the matter berky she said
mockingly didnt you enjoy it
im scared of don i told her i
dont claim to be as tough as walter
and he was scared sick last week when
he thought you might tell don that

hed forced himself on you

  youre taking a big jump ahead
what do you think is going to follow
that kiss

  i can hope cant i i sat down
on the edge of the unmade bed and
worked at looking miserable what
would don do if you left him for me
youll never get a chance to find
out it was a nice kiss period dons
my man and im sticking to him dont
forget it she turned to the mirror
to inspect her face it needed refur-
bishing after that kiss she took stuff
out of her handbag

  youre safe now i said to her
back with lily dead

  the lipstick paused at the corner of
the mouth what do you mean by
that crack

  remember how don almost took a
sock at me when i talked about lily
and the second man shed married and
walter warned me to keep my mouth
shut about her don cant stand hear-
ing about her shes dead but hes not
got over being in love with her and
never will

  dont try to get profound berky
she said into the mirror

  dons in love with a ghost i went
on yet walter was afraid of what don
would do to him for making love to
you it isnt sense

  she concentrated on restoring the
lips then she said don holds onto
what he has he has me

  and you hold onto what you have
i said even when lily was alive she
was a ghost haunting you you were
only sitting in for her don would have
dropped you in a minute if she wanted
to go back to him she had you wor-
ried all the time

  i expected bertha to flare out and
spew out angry words she didnt
she was changing a pin in her flame
hair and looking at my reflection in the


mammoth mystery

mirror she only said you seem to
know a hell of a lot berky

  i can add two and two

  why all this talk whats it sup-
posed to lead to

  i have to find out where i stand
if you keep coming up to this room
im no hero but if don let somebody
get away with marrying lily when he
still wanted her why should he get
tough with me about you

her face was properly lacquered

     she turned and leaned languidly
against the dresser the three tiers of
her dress jutting dons a funny guy
she said thoughtfully hes a poker
player twenty-four hours a day keeps
things to himself but when he breaks
loose hes bad i think thats what
made lily divorce him she liked
money more than any woman i ever
knew and don has plenty she liked
don too hes a womans man but
never mind that lily gave him plenty
of reason to get jealous and explode
perhaps the reason she married that
kid linn in such a hurry was to get
away from don even after she had the
divorce theres something in having
a legal husband that even don would
be afraid to buck yeah she was
scared of him so is walter and so
are you and so am i im coming
up here for a few reasons one of them
is i dont want to get you into trouble
he didnt do anything to linn
like i said that was marriage me
coming up here is cheating on him be-
sides linn went overseas a few days
after he married lily and didnt come
back till the night he murdered her
so you cant tell what don would have
done

  i had maneuvered up to it i said
maybe it was don who murdered
lily

  two years after she married linn

  it was the night linn came back to
live with lily i said don had been
up to see her at a party only the week
before you were there he must
have got her off by himself and asked
her again to come back to him she
turned him down he couldnt stand
the thought of another man coming
back to live with her the next sat-
urday night he drove up there alone
and killed her

  her artificial lashes almost covered
her eyes how do you know so much
about what happened

  that newspaper article was pretty
detailed

  there was nothing at all about don
being married to lily in that local
paper he subscribes to nothing about
me either or that party at lilys the
week before

  the air in the room was suddenly
stifling what local paper

  a weekly sheet the hale county
star thats the upstate county where
lily was murdered don subscribed to
it because it was the only paper that
carried all the details of the murder
and the trial when it came in the
mail hed spend hours sitting and read-
ing the same words over and over then
when he read that alexander linn was
acquitted i couldnt talk to him for a
whole day i was almost afraid hed
go up there and do his own executing
since the law wouldnt maybe he
wouldve if linn hadnt murdered
schneider only two days later and then
taken a powder

 hat was why my face had been
familiar to her and yard when
theyd met me twice within two
months theyd seen my photo in the
star-an inaccurate and poorly repro-
duced halftone which had been like a
face vaguely glimpised in a crowd and
remembered without detail if they
the spider lily



had seen my photo after i had come
to them after they had my living fea-
tures before them they would have
made the connection

   i said the writer of the article i
read must have scooped the local re-
porters on dons marriage to lily and
the other dirt

  that may have satisfied bertha as
to the source of my knowledge i
couldnt tell she appeared to have lost
interest in the topic she was facing
the mirror and setting the layercake on
her flame hair

  how can you be sure don didnt
kill lily i said

   its plain that linn killed her

  he never stopped insisting that he
was innocent	t

  the hat was precariously in place
she started to draw on her gloves
now i see what youre after berky
if you can get don jailed for murder
you can have me without worrying
about him youre barking up the
wrong tree first of all don wouldnt
have harmed a hair of her head maybe
hed kill the guy who married her but
not her second he was on cape cod
the night she was murdered

  are you sure

  i ought to be i was with him we
drove out there friday we were to
stay a week or so monday morning
walt phoned don from new york that
hed just read a couple of lines in the
morning paper that lily had been
murdered saturday night don drove
right back to new york as if he could
do anything about it and then he called
up the hale county star and got the
dope about the murder her death hit
him like a ton of bricks

  where was walter that saturday
night

  how should i know somewhere
around new york i guess say dont
tell me you got an idea that walt killed

her

   no i said all right don didnt
kill her he wouldnt harm her and
he was on cape cod but schneider
had been her lover maybe don killed

him

  why only schneider why not
linn and while he was at it all the
others shed ever messed around with
she shook her head berky theres
nothing in it youre not going to get
don out of the way like that even if
i thought you could i wouldnt play
along id keep my mouth shut she
picked up her handbag i shouldve
phoned you instead of coming here

  i rose from the bed and put my
hands on her shoulders and kissed her
it wasnt like the first one she broke
it up after a couple of seconds

  youre a sweet boy berky she
said listlessly but you spoiled it by
talking too much your ticket for the
show will be waiting for you at the box
office

   i cant make it i told her

  broadway and public places were
out of bounds for me i knew hun-
dreds of airmen all over the world and
sooner or later some of those who sur-
vived would turn up in new york
which to a man back from action meant
bright lights and nightclubs and thea-
ters

  her eyes were screened by the arti-
ficial lashes which were red to match
her hair you let a man kiss you and
he gets sore at you she said you
can never give a man enough

  here was the chance id been wait-
ing for to become socially friendly with
the three of them bertha had kissed
me and yard had asked me to the
theater the ice was broken id been
gambling from the first and taken
plenty of risk why not a little more

   all right ill be there i said

  there was no farewell kiss my


mammoth mystery

cheek was patted with a gloved hand
and then she was gone

a bottle of milk was in the re-
frigerator with a glass of it in
my hand i opened the top righthand
drawer of the dresser and took out the
sheets of yellow paper on which i had
written variations of the equation i
pushed aside the embroidered scarf
which covered the dresser top and
spread out a fresh sheet of paper and
wrote

     the following are the possible
  suspects miriam hennessey ur-
  sula hennessey kerry nugent
  george winkler oliver spencer
  bevis spencer helen spencer og-
  den garback don yard walter

  i read over the list as i drank down
the milk then i added owen
dowie and under it i wrote

     which of the suspects will sat-
  isfy the linear equation with a
  single unknown which results from
  the following hypotheses

    let xthe suspect

    let olopportunity to mur-
  der lily

   let klknowledge of my
 movements in lilys murder

    let mlmotive for murder-
  ing lily

    let

  i left it there and went into the bath-
room to shave i returned to the dres-
ser and picked up my pen there were
eight terms in all i didnt finish the
summary i could see which was the
only one of the ten xs the equation
could satisfy

  so what did i have i was using a
system of trial and error in a technique
which required fixed values i slammed

down the pen the point broke

  at once i regretted my rage that
pen had served me through college and
in the air force many years ago
miriam had given it to me for a birth-
day present

chapter xviii
the pay-off

t reached the theater after the
first act curtain and in darkness
sidled past walter and don yard and
bertha and sat in the empty seat on her
right her fingers groped for my hand
and stroked it i snatched my hand
away was she crazy with don yard
sitting on the other side of her

  when the lights came on for the in-
termission it seemed to me that the
theater was filled with uniforms youd
have thought the war wasnt over i
dipped my face into my program

  anybody coming for a smoke
walter asked

  yard and bertha said that they would
sit the intermission out i said same
here and at the moment i heard my
name called

  hey alec the voice shouted en-
thusiastically

  clip larsen was standing at the aisle
seat four rows down and waving to me
i went hollow inside i glanced to my
left yard and bertha sitting and
walter standing were watching clip
when he saw that i wasnt coming to
him he started to come to me

  i sprang up to intercept him before
he got close enough for them to hear
whatever he would say to me i tripped
over yards feet pardon me theres
a friend of mine i panted walter
pushed back against his raised seat to
give me room to pass i met clip
halfway	

  one thing was certain he didnt
the spider lily



know about lily or that i was wanted
by the police otherwise he wouldnt
have shaken my hand so heartily and
introduced me to his mother and the
girl he was engaged to marry for half
a dozen flights he had been bombardier
in our b- then he got dengue fever
and after he recovered hed been trans-
ferred to another ship there was a
silver bar on his shoulder now instead
of a gold one

   for a small eternity i stood there at
their seats shooting the breeze with
him and his mother and his girl clip
was leaving at two in the morning for
a florida base and the women felt bad
about it though he hoped to get his
discharge before winter i saw walter
return from the lobby i kept talking
i dont know about what though air-
men are always full of gossip when
the curtain buzzer sounded i had to
go back

  don yard asked the inevitable ques-
tion for the three of them as soon as i
was settled in my seat what did
that soldier call you

  al i said i leaned past bertha
lowered my voice discreetly my name
is really alfred jeffery i dropped the
alfred and added the berkowitz when
i was kicked out of the army i be-
came friendly with lieutenant larsen
in a hospital in india we both had
dengue fever

  it seemed to sound good enough to
them yard nodded and watched the
second act curtain rise

soon as the show ended i ex-
plained that i was agoing to the
mens room and left in a hurry for
a full ten minutes i stayed out of sight
by the time i came up the theater was
empty the three of them were waiting
for me under the marquee

  walt and i have some business
yard said to me how about doing

me a favor and taking bertha home

  i said id be glad to yard and
walter walked off and i left bertha to
hunt up a taxi in the after-theater rush
i walked from forty-fifth street to
forty-first before i managed to drag an
empty one back with me

  in the taxi i took berthas hand
she let it lie limp she didnt turn her
face to me with yard beside her in
the theater she had been anxious to
touch me how can you figure out a
woman

  whats the matter i said
change your mind since this after-
noon

  her voice was dull its the other
way around i found out ive got it
bad for you

  and now youre scared of don

  more than you think

  i didnt like it i had no desire to
get in too deep with her now or to hurt
her later she was all right i would
have done better with her than with
lily if id had any business with either
of them or any woman like them

  we held emotionless hands until we
reached the gray brick house i paid
off the driver and followed her to the
private entrance under the stoop

  come in she said woodenly

  i tagged in after her she switched
on the living room light and dropped
her cream-colored ermine wrap on a
chair as if it were a rag she wore a
green strapless evening gown her fig-
ure had no trouble holding it up with-
out visible supports this was like a
sophisticated comedy the scene set for
passion i wasnt particularly happy
about it

  but she wasnt having any just then
she went to the bleached oak desk and
opened a lower drawer a pile of news-
papers lay in it i knew then what was
coming i stood watching her numb
and without the ability to think she


mammoth mystery

selected one paper looked at it then
walked over to me without sex in her
movements she dropped the paper on
the coffee table

  alexander linn she said

  just stood there

  she said down to my photo in the
newspaper that officer in the theater
called you alec it wasnt al like you
said but alec since lily was mur-
dered this paper has come to the house
every thursday and its full of the
name of alexander linn or alec linn
as even the paper calls him mostly
and it came out at the trial that linn
was a cracker jack poker player and hed
been fighting in india like jeff berko-
witz and how did you know so much
about lilys murder and why were you
always wanting to talk about her if
youd never known her i sat between
you and don in the dark theater and
tried to remember the picture of alec
linn id seen in this paper i couldnt
but the first time i saw you you looked
like somebody id seen before dur-
ing the show i was so scared i nearly
died

  i was silent

  her head came up get out if i
caught wise to you don will too hell
kill you her voice went strident
dont just look at me start running
i didnt murder anybody i said
she didnt listen to me or hear me
she fell against me i felt her mouth
on my chin and on my cheeks and
finally on my mouth i never thought
anybody could get inside me like you
have she said but its too late it
was too late before i even set eyes on
you

  i dug my hands into her bare shoul-
ders and held her a little way off
listen to me im innocent

  i know you were acquitted of lilys
murder but the cops are after you for

shooting schneider

  damn it i never murdered any-
body i yelled at her why do you
think i came to new york to get close
to don yard hes as dangerous to
me as the police but im grabbing at
straws to clear mjself youve got to
help me

  we stood two feet apart with my
hands on her shoulders connecting us
berky are you on the level

  i was framed for both murders
is that why you talked so much
about it in your room this afternoon
light went out of her eyes you
think don killed lily and then framed
you because he hated you but then
he would have to ha ve known you how
could he frame you without ever hav-
ing seen you before and he was on
cape cod with me that night

  is that the truth

  i wouldnt alibi him not now id
see him in hell if that would give you
to me her body was hard against
mine berky youve got to get out
of town maybe well meet somewhere
you cant hang around waiting for don
and the cops

t held her close this was the rot-
tenest thing i had ever done using
her like this id let her down as easily
as i could in a little while

  theres a chance you can help me
i said into her hair i think i have
what i need but im not dead sure
lily maintained some sort of contact
with don during the two years she
lived in west amber he took her out
on the fourth of july and visited her
a week before her murder with you
and walter and others i dont know
what i want or what there is but maybe
something she said to you or that don
told you she told him

  berky that phone call  she eased
herself away from me my fingers had
the spider lily



left marks on her bare shoulders
thats it she said excitedly lily
phoned don a couple of nights before
she was stabbed she was afraid of

somebody

 who

  she didnt say it was thursday
night im sure because we were pack-
ing to leave for cape cod next morn-
ing i answered the phone and it was
lily and she asked for don we were
in the bedroom don took the call on
the extension in this room i listened
in on the bedroom phone i wanted
to hear whatever lily had to say to
him i dont have to tell you why

  why was lily threatened

  she didnt get a chance to tell don
all she said was that some crazy guy
had said hed kill her she wanted don
and walt to come up to west amber
and scare the daylights out of him
they could do it once somebody was
hedging on a bet hed lost to don don
and walt took him for a drive in the
car they didnt say much they just
let him look at a gun like they did with
you the time they took your roll then
they drove him home don said the
mans legs were so weak he could hardly
walk from the car across the sidewalk
to his house the next day he paid
up that was what lily wanted don
to do to whoever she was scared of
don was sore at her i know why hed
been angling to get her back and shed
turned him down so he told lily to
get out of her own messes with her boy
friends lily said this wasnt anybody
who had ever touched her or wanted to
don said well this is jhe first guy i
heard of who didnt want to or you
wouldnt let and he hung up on her

  i sat down heavily and went about
the business of lighting a cigarette in
order to keep my hands occupied

  bertha said then when we heard
lily was murdered don assumed it was

you shed been scared of so did i but
now it clears up if she was afraid
youd kill her when you came home
why did she stay there in west amber
waiting for you and wouldnt she
have told don it was you she spoke
of this guy who was threatening her
like he was nobody at all to her thats
why i believe you you didnt do it
that other guy did

  she came over to my chair and took
the cigarette from me and killed it in
an ashtray and dropped down on my
lap berky darling does anything
ive told you help

  yes

  you mean you know who did it
yes but i havent the proof
oh god she put her face into
my shoulder i could feel her breasts
heave but i couldnt see if she was
weeping soundlessly or breathing heav-
ily i held her tenderly we sat like
that as if by inaction we could postpone
reality

t should leave now there was
nothing else for me here i had
what i had come after all that was
left for me was to take it to district
attorney hackett and slap it on his
desk

     i would say call off your blood-
  hounds this shows who the mur-
  derer really is

    he would say whats all this
  arithmetic

    i would say the evidence a
  beautijully satisfied equation

    he would say and you are con-
  vinced that this proves that x mur-
  dered lily linn and emil schnei-
  der

    i would say i am

    he woidd say marvelous this
  will revolutionize police science
  all we will have to do in the future
  is to have x equal a formula and


mammoth mystery

  well have our criminal

    i would say well its not ex-
  actly as simple as that the spe-
  cial set of circumstances in this
  case make it possible

    he would say you disappoint
 me greatly for moment i hoped
 for considerable unemployment of
 policemen however i thank you
 from the bottom of my heart for
 solving this case for me so simply

   i would say my reason was
 wholly selfish

   he would say all the same

 i thank you it will make me
 ashamed to collect my pay for the
 next month i will merely have to
 read your equation to a jury and
 the conviction of x will follow au-
 tomatically any little thing i can
 do for you to express my grati-
 tude

    i would say i dont want any-
  thing except to be let alone and go
  home

    he would say now thats un-
 fortunate because that is the one
 thing i cannot do for you it hap-
 pens that i am placing you under
 arrest for the murder of emil
 schneider my regret is that under
 law you cannot be tried a second
 time for the murder of lily linn
 though that is really of small im-
 portance we have not yet found
 a way of executing a man twice

    i would say but my beautiful
  equation

  he would say-

 she stirred on my lap snuggled
closer her mouth crawled up the side
of my neck and along the ridge of my
jaw berky what are we going to
do

  you dont want any part of me i
told her theyre hunting me and if
they catch me theyll kill me hold
onto what you have

  what have i got i want you
maybe we can work something out
theres poker all over the world and
you can make a living everywhere they
play it

  so i had to let her have it i was a
coward i turned my head away so
that i would not have to look into her
eyes and i saw don yard

tje was standing just inside the
door leading from the rest of the
apartment hed come in soundlessly
through the back door to spring his
trap one of us would have noticed him
before this if he had been there long
but a single moment was enough

  he removed a ding cigar from his
craggy face very touching he ob-
served

  berthas head butted my chin in
twisting toward the voice oh god
she moaned she sagged lower on me
suddenly dead weight

  don yard came toward us as wide
and inexorable as a tank his arms
hung loosely with the short strong fin-
gers spread then berthas hair hid
him from me it got in my mouth i
heard her say thinly don but she
hadnt the strength to entangle herself
from me i slid my face free of her
hair and saw him again

  he had reached the white coffee table
and had picked up the hale county
star he looked at my photo

  is he linn walter asked

  walters presence hadnt registered
before this hed been only the back-
ground standing against the farther
wall with both hands in his pockets and
cigarette smoke weaving up over his
long impassive face

  what do you think yard said it
bothered me where id seen him before
it was in this paper his voice was
a tired monotone alexander linn
the rat who likes the women i like he
the spider lily



stuck a knife in lily and now-

  the rest died off into a silence that
said and now bertha there was no
answer i could make

  casually he pulled a snub-nosed au-
tomatic pistol out of a pocket get
off him bertha

  no don she threw both arms
around my neck sitting high on me
now her half-bared perfumed breasts
pressed into my face i couldnt see
or breathe suddenly i felt more ridic-
ulous than afraid

  don he didnt kill lily she said
for heavens sake give him a chance
i gave him a chance to be alone
with you yard told her in that dead
voice he was using tonight he took
lily and he took you and he killed
lily

  he didnt kill lily listen to me
don remember that night lily phoned
you and said she was scared of some-
body it couldnt have been berky-
alec linn

  get off him

  no

  facing death was bad enough with-
out the added indignity of a shield of
half-naked flesh i pulled her arms
from about my neck i strove to rise
taking her up with me resistance
went out of her she rose to her feet
under her own power and took a couple
of swaying steps to the side of the chair
and then reached out to cling to its high
back i stood up as soon as i was free
of her weight

   if you kill me youll let lilys mur-
derer get away with it i said im
the only one who knowswho he is
the gun lay flat on yards broad
palm his finger wound about the trig-
ger you cant say a thing i want
to hear

  nothing convincing him that i
hadnt murdered lily if i could con-
vince him still left my marriage to

lily and my love-making with bertha

xalter had come across the room
to yards side the cigarette
bobbed with the motion of his lips
not here don

  you think i want to spoil a rug i
paid three grand for yard said the
gun cut a small arc in the air in front
of my chest the cars over on ninth
avenue well go through the alley
start moving rat

  this was the way it was done in the
remote and not quite real world of the
newspapers and the movies a man
steps into a car and rides a few miles
to a desolate section of the suburbs and
ends up with a bullet in him dying
or the anticipation of dying wasnt the
hardest part of it for two years id
steeled myself with a certain amount of
fatalistic success to accept the coming
of death at any hour but to die like
this pointlessly and without a chance
to prove to miriam and ursula and the
others who cared for me and had once
respected me that i had never mur-
dered was bitterly unfair

  i can give it to you here and wo can
carry you away yard said make
up your mind

  i started to shake with uncontroll-
able rage nearby somebody whim-
pered

  yellow walter said scornfully
howd they ever let a yellow-belly like
this in one of those big bombers

  the whimpers were coming from me
i locked my lips against them and put
my unsteady hands behind my back
walk yard said

  bertha was no longer clinging to the
back of the chair i hadnt been aware
of movement but now i saw her stand-
ing against the bleached oak desk
there was nothing left of her lacquered
face but splotches of garish paint

  ill tell the cops you shot him she


mammoth mystery

said

  yard looked at her over his shoulder
maybe youd like to come along
she withered against the desk don
please ill be your slave dont hurt
him please

  who wants you any more yard
looked at her thoughtfully scratching
his chin with the muzzle of the gun
this is my job anyway i can handle
the kid alone you stay here with
her walt and keep your eyes on her
till i come back

  he stepped around me and put his
free hand at the small of my back and
shoved i stumbled forward regained
my balance walked toward the door
in the far wall of the room yard fol-
lowed

  i passed within five feet of bertha
she had her back to us now and was
sagging broken and helpless over the
desk she did not turn her head for a
last look at me i stepped through
the doorway

jphe shots were blurred coughing
sounds two or three or four of them
overlapping when i turned don yard
was already on the floor a hand
flapped weakly out to claw the edge of
the persian rug and suddenly died be-
coming one with the inertness of the
rest of that wide and solid mass of
flesh and bones

  the gun was in berthas hand it
was a tiny pearl-handled revolver held
against her right hip she leaned limply
against the top open drawer of the
desk the drawer in which don yard
must have kept that extra gun her
mouth opened and closed and again
opened and closed but no sound came
from her

  my eyes searched for walter he
was coming slowly toward me with his
hands still in his pockets when he
reached yard he squatted and took out

both his hands no gun was in either
he felt the motionless flesh the veil
remained over his eyes but a corner of
his mouth started to twitch as if fight-
ing a smile you got him good sweet-
heart he said and stood up

  he listend to the street outside and
the house above us the stillness
maintained ft was doubtful if any-
body had been awakened by the shots
or hearing them had recognized them
as shots the sound of a  revolver
is no louder than a hand slapped sharp-
ly on a table

  walter strolled leisurely over to ber-
tha and reached for the gun she uttered
a thin cry and pulled hand and gun be-
hind her back

  better let me handle it sweetheart
he said youre in trouble

  she stared up into his face slowly
as if hypnotized by those empty eyes of
his she brought the gun back into view
he plucked if from her fingers and
dropped it into a pocket he put his
face very close to hers and spoke those
soft slurred undertones did not quite
carry to me

  i didnt care what he was saying it
was up to me to think faster and more
accurately than ever before in my life
and i couldnt i was shaking hardly
at all physically i was all right i was
holding together but that might be
only a hopeless acknowledgement of
final defeat as i stood beside a dead
body for the third time in two months
three strikes and out bast

  bertha and walter were coming to-
ward me his arm was intimately pos-
sessively about her waist her stride
was unhampered by fear or strain her
face was smoothly in place the pic-
ture didnt quite fit

  they skirted around the dead man
berthas eyes were fixed straight ahead
so that she wouldnt have to look at him
or at me walter stepped behind her
the spider lily



to give her room to get through the door
he looked back at me lets talk in
the other room he said

jte was snapping the light on when
i entered it was the dining room
bertha stood at the wall mirror pinning
up her hair it had become somewhat
undone while shed been sitting on my
lap

  heres the play kid walter said
to me first the part that concerns
me and bertha we didnt come home
from the show with don we went
somewhere for drinks and maybe a
party he told us he had a date with
somebody here at twelve though he
didnt tell us who and went right home
the idea is he wanted to be alone with
whoever he was meeting ive got
plenty of pals around wholl alibi ber-
tha and me guys who owe me favors
in an hour or so ill get one of them to
phone the police on a dial phone that he
was passing this house and heard shots
hell say he doesnt want to be bothered
with red tape so he wont give his name
hell hang up and beat it all right the
thing is when the call comes in bertha
and i will be where a hundred people
will see us some of them will say
weve been there since eleven-thirty
im wanted for murder anyway so
one more wont matter i said grimly
i take the rap for bertha is that it
no berky bertha said giving her
hair a final pat were all in this to-
gether and well get out together
walter nodded thats it kid all
in together like the three musketeers
if the cops pick you ujffor this youd
say bertha did the shooting-

  to save my life from don thats
legitimate

  maybe a jury will believe thats why
she shot him maybe it wont we dont
have to take the chance if the cops
pick you up youll say it was bertha

and theyll break her into confessing
theyll do it i know how those babies
work so the idea is to make sure the
cops dont pick you up for this if they
dont you wont go to them and squeal
on bertha because youre wanted for
another killing theres no chance of
you and bertha doublecrossing each
other

  where do you come in i said
he sent a thin smile to bertha she
looked down at the floor then sat down
at one of the dining table chairs and
elaborately smoothed out the table-
cloth it cleared up then she had made
a deal with him he had always wanted
her and now he could have her if he got
us both out of this

  im doing it for bertha he told me
with that ghost smile pasted to his long
face now start thinking kid how
many people know you were working
for don

  nobody unless earl locust was
told

  not a chance it was good business
to keep the set-up under wraps you
met don in his place but so did a lot
of other guys how many people know
jeffery berkowitz

  locust and my landlady mrs
egan she knows even less about me
than he does

  good what about you as linn
anybody know linn is in new york
two people one was clip larsen
who saw me in the theater tonight he
has no idea that im wanted by the po-
lice and hes leaving for florida in an
hour or so

  you said two people

  robin magee is the other he was
my lawyer and last night he met me in
locusts apartment hes the one per-
son outside of bertha and you who
knows that jeffery berkowitz is alec
linn im still his client in a way so he
promised not to tell the police


mammoth mystery

  i know magee one time he hid a
guy out for a month till he got his de-
fense all set hes a smart mouthpiece
you dont have to worry about him if
he opens his mouth now he makes him-
self an accessory because he kept quiet
about seeing you last night see what
im getting at kid bertha and i will
get ourselves alibis we cant do the
same thing for you because youre hot
to begin with so we have to be careful
nobody ties up berkowitz and linn and
don yard or the cops will start getting
ideas okay then youre set you
check out of your room tomorrow morn-
ing and scram

jdertha stood up and looked
through the doorway into the living
room one of yards outstretched
hands was visible to me and probably
to her she turned her head away and
she broke a little hurry she said
i cant stand it

  a couple of minutes yet walter
said weve got to get rid of your fin-
gerprints kid mine and berthas dont
count we live here but the cops
have yours on file and might get an
idea to check take your handkerchief
and wipe everything you touched

  i hated to go back into the living
room but i had to i started with the
doorknobs and ended with the chair in
which bertha had sat on my lap wal-
ter came in to fetch berthas ermine
cape and handbag and went out with-
out a word to me i was about to fol-
low him when i remembered the light-
switch i wiped it

  don yard blocked my path back into
the dining room it was somewhat
grisly the way we had to walk over him
or sidle around his outstretched hands
to pass from one room to the other i
stopped at his feet to look down at him
for the first time i saw the hole in the
back of his head or rather where a

small patch of the short hair at the nape
was matted with blood only a tiny
lead slug from an almost toy-like  re-
volver not as deep as a steak knife
plunged into a womans heart or as ef-
ficient as a rifle shooting down a man on
a porch at pointblank range but it had
sufficed m

  a rifle i thought three corpses and
three different weapons but only a rifle
presented a serious problem after the
act the steak knife could be left in
the body without danger to the killer
after the print had been wiped off the
revolver bertha had used could easily
be disposed of by walter but a rifle had
bulk and individuality it was con-
spicuously connected to the owner
familiar possession a piece of furniture
decorating a wall

  arent you through berky ber-
tha called

  i roused myself  stepped carefully
around the outstretched hand clinging
in death to the snub-nosed automatic
and entered the dining room bertha
was alone i heard walter opening and
closing a drawer in another room
probably he was after the large sums of
cash a gambler like yard would keep at
hand in his apartment

che had the ermine cape over her
shoulders and was renewing her face
with the contents of her handbag are
you set berky she asked with a pen-
cil at her eyebrows as if i were call-
ing on her to take her out on a casual
date

  she was working at being hard as
nails that was veneer protective cov-
ering to survive or endure the narrow
shadow world she lived in for a few
minutes tonight she had shed it for me
but don yards death had made her put
it on again covered by that layer of
toughness she could take the killing of
one man and bargaining her body to
the spider lily



another man in stride it held up the
outer shell of her whatever was hap-
pening inside of her

  i said i cant let you do this for
me

  she zipped the handbag closed say
you dont think i shot don because of
you you didnt see me going for a gun
until he told walter to watch me i was
scared crazy of what hed do to me
when he got back

  maybe i said

  oh sure the fact that he was tak-
ing you for a ride had something to do
with it but the real reason i did it was
i was looking out for this little girls
health

  she sounded tougher than i had ever
heard her she was putting it on thick
for my benefit

  i mean i cant let you go with wal-
ter i said

  hes not such a bad guy in my
time ive been with worse

  go away with me instead thats
what you want to do isnt it i
looked back at the gun clutched in don
yards dead hand ill take care of
walter

  dont talk like a kid what do you
want to do-kill him

  no

  then what you and me run out
together how far do you think well
get with walt phoning the cops before
we can go a block say you tie him up
-the cops will still be after us maybe a
day behind but after us you think i
want that when i can sit safe and snug
with walter youre poison to me
berky

  poison i said i did this to you
if i hadnt come around you would
never have had to shoot don

  what the hell i asked for it i
threw myself at you she looked at
me for a long time and a remote smile
whisked over her red lips for a

while i kidded myself but i know bet-
ter now you never said you loved me
all you wanted out of me was dope on
lilys murder

  i like you a lot

  she kissed me it was a brief sister-
ly kiss thats weet berky you
think you have to ask me to go away
with you because i saved your life
only im going with walter thats
the only way it can work out for both
of us abruptly her voice was harsh
she said lets go and swung away
from me

  we found walter in the kitchen he
stood at the sink filling a glass with
water he drank it down without hur-
ry-

  bertha and i will go out first he
said wait a couple of minutes kid
dons car is on ninth avenue dont
touch it keep going

  then they were gone through the
back door no farewell from bertha
no final look back at me she was
gone with walter

  i remained in the kitchen for the
space-of two hundred heartbeats in
the dark littered yard i remembered
that i had just closed the back door be-
hind me i returned and wiped both
doorknobs and then groped my way up
the narrow alley to ninth avenue

chapter xix
the return

hphe white dress revealed
her seated on the top porch step
her hand lifted to the darker shadow
that was her face the cigarette glowed
as she drew on it momentarily high-
lighting her features in a soft blur

  it was forty-five hours since don
yard had been killed next day i had
checked out of the rooming house at
noon-yesterday i had ridden the sub-


mammoth mystery

way to the north bronx and thumbed
the rest of the way i could have made
west amber by this morning but i
had tried to time it to arrive under cover
of darkness that hadnt quite worked
out my last lift a salesman bound for
cleveland would have passed through
west amber a couple of hours before
twilight i had dropped off three miles
before the town and had hidden in
woods until darkness permitted me to
walk unseen

  the lights of the house were bright
and hospitable and cozy i hadnt had
real sleep in two nights i was grimy and
unshaven i was still a fugitive-but i
felt more secure and rested and looser
inside than in months in years i
was home that first homecoming
nearly two months ago had been a con-
tinuation of the horror subdued usu-
ally sometimes bursting in your brain
like shrapnel that was war and living
in time of war this was home now
with all i wanted in it-a girl waiting
for me on a porch step

  i cut across the lawn

  she saw me when i crossed the drive-
way she stood up poised on the step
as if to plunge off it i couldnt have
appeared more to her than a human
form without identity or distinguish-
able shape but suddenly she dropped
her cigarette and raced down the steps
then she was in my arms and i was
kissing her as i had never kissed any
woman but lily not even lily for
there was a consuming yearning in the
meeting of our mouths that was pas-
sion and beyond passion

  darling i knew youd come back
miriam said at last the words rushing
from her in a flow of emotion ive
been waiting for you ursula has been
keeping a lot of cash in the house for
you well go away together to
south america anywhere you say

  west amber is a good place to live

i told her

  please darling dont be flippant or
stubborn now i couldnt stand it and
dont go into the house well wait in
the garden until they leave

  i stiffened the police

  almost as bad kerry and george
winkler are having a conference with
ursula george just returned from
new york he wants to tell the po-
lice i couldnt stay in there listening
to him thats why i was sitting out-
side

  george wants to tell the police
what

  about don yard he knows

t

j couldnt see her face but her
voice was broken and hopeless for
gods sake speak in a complete sen-
tence what do the police know
nothing but george and robin
magee know

  the knots that had started to form
untied it was all right i was safe
and bertha was safe or were we

  i didnt kill yard or anybody else
i said with luck ill be able to clear
this up tonight then well get mar-
ried and ill find a job and well live
decent normal lives ill work it out
do you hear me-ill work it out
tonight

  her face was against my chest
darling i love you so her voice came
muffled i cant think of anything ex-
cept how much i wan you

  if i ever stop being a model hus-
band remind me what a dope ive been
all these years i said i love you
thats rhetoric but  spend the rest
of my life showing you what i mean
all i ask is that you have faith in me
for just a little while longer

  yes alec she replied with noth-
ing at all in her voice

  it was unfair to demand too much
from faith i left it at that i put my
the spider lily	

arm about her waist and turned her
toward the house and together we went
in

  everything stopped dead when mi-
riam and i entered the living room a
ghost couldnt have done it better

  ursula was the lirst to move she
threw her arms about my neck and
words spewed from her in a half-sob
alec ive money here waiting for
you youll have to leave at once-
tonight miriam insists on going with
you but she mustnt if you care for
her at all you cant let her throw her-
self away like this

  dont worry about either of us i
said i stepped around her and over to
kerry

  his two-month leave had done him a
lot of good he looked ruddy and fit
though he was bulging a trifle around
the middle he attempted a grin and
gave it up and fumbled at his belt in
embarrassment i stuck out my hand
he looked down at it and wet his lips
and then accepted it his grip lacked
its usual heartiness

  hows the boy i said

  all right kerry mumbled

  there cant be much of your leave
left

  im reporting back in a couple of
days im hoping theyll let me out
soon

  hows with you and helen

  were engaged

  it wasnt a satisfactory dialogue
the words dribbled out of him as if
there were no thought behind them

reorge winklers bear body
was deep in a chair from it he
watched me angrily i extended my
hand to him he ignored it keeping
his fists at his jowls

  don yard was shot he said

  i read about it in the paper i
said there was little detail i guess

don yard wasnt as big a big-shot as he
liked to believe merely another gam-
bler killed

  so you admit you knew him
  what did magee tell you

  what the hell did you come back
for george burst out every time
you kill somebody you come running
home why dont you put a bullet in
your head and let ursula and miriam
alone

  behind me there was a gasp of hor-
ror-miriam or ursula i didnt look
around

  ill answer your questions after i
get some details i said to george
how much does magee know
enough to phone me this morning
to drop everything and rush to new
york he didnt dare tell me over the
phone a few days ago hed met you
with a fast poker crowd in new york
you were going under the name of
berkowitz after he read that yard
was murdered he got in touch with
the man whose house he met you in-
earl locust from locust he learned
that you had been anxious to meet
yard and that you had met him during
a game in his place

  is that all locust told him

  he doesnt know that berkowitz is
alec linn if thats any satisfaction to
you it isnt to me

  he was angry clear through angry
with me for having put him in this
position and with himself because he
hated to do what he felt he had to

  its the pattern that gets you i
said i killed lily and am out to get
everybody who ever mate love to her
i suppose my next victim will be bill
beaty when he comes back from the
wars

  alec ursula cried alec dont
talk like that

  hes stark raving mad george
said heavily


mammoth mystery

  all right so im mad i told him
even so im entitled to details the
papers carried very few

  george looked up at me with his lips
drawn in he pushed them out ma-
gee has an in at police headquarters
the police received an anonymous
phone call which they couldnt trace
that shots were heard in yards apart-
ment i suppose you made that call
they found yard dead with an un-
fired gun in his hand and with the
doorknobs and light-switches and some
of the furniture wiped clean of finger-
prints yard had been at a show with
bertha kaleman and walter herring
when the show was over he told them
he was to meet somebody at the apart-
ment and hurried away without telling
them who it was they said he was
pretty grim throughout the show ma-
gee and i know of course that it was
you he had gone home to meet

  you dont know anything i said
where were bertha and walter
you cant shunt it off on them
they proved they were at a party when
you shot don yard

  what do the police think

  you were smarter this time than
the first two times you get that way
with experience after your fourth or
fifth killing youll develop the art of
murder to a high degree of perfection

jphe gasp came again this time
i knew it was miriam because
ursula said george i wont let you
say such things in my house

  its my fault george told her bit-
terly i helped him get away with
the first one i pray to heaven hes
insane it would be too terrible if he
did these things while sane

  he was scourging himself as well as
me with words if hed talked less he
would be more dangerous at the mo-
ment

  what does the shooting look like to
the police i persisted

  talk was what he wanted to get
some of his bitterness out from inside
him and into the open like the mur-
der of a gambler by somebody who
owed him a lot of money the police
figure that yaxd and the other man
quarrelled over money and that yard
drew his gun but that he was beaten
to the shot by the other man or that
the murder was planned ahead and
yard was shot down from behind all
three bullets had come from behind-
two in his back and one in the back
of the skull yard probably drew his
gun after he was hit the first time or
after he was dead the gun was placed
in his hand by the murderer the po-
lice suspect it was an underworld char-
acter because of the careful attention
given to removing fingerprints and be-
cause yard who it seems never wore
a gun took care to wear one when he
prepared to meet the killer george
glowered youve always been a
scholar alec you learn quickly how
to do such things right

  do the police suspect the existence
of jeffery berkowitz

  they dont according to magee
nor that alec linn vas in new york
that night

  walter had done a very nice job he
knew how to handle such matters thor-
oughly and convincingly possibly
that was the perfection of experience
george had mentioned

  and magee is frightened i said
if im picked up for the shooting and
it comes out that magee had seen me
the night before and had kept his
mouth shut his goose is cooked that
was why he sent the frantic call to you
he has to protect himself by protecting
me

  george thumped the arm of his
chair i dont give a damn what hap-
the spider lily



pens to magee i have a certain
amount of responsibility to society if
nobody else has

  kerry said weakly there ought
to be some way of handling it without
giving alec away to the police

  not again george roared ev-
ery time we let him get away from us
somebody else is murdered

  may i have a cigarette george
i asked quietly

jjte stared at me in surprise then
lumbered up to his feet and took
out a pack i struck my own match
because i knew that my hands would
be steady i was showing off i
should have been going to pieces but
george was the one who was shouting
what george had told me about the
police had propped up a base under my
feet i had something to grip with my
toes and stand erect whatever had
been done to me by the war and lily
was over past finished-if i got safely
through tonight

  i didnt shoot yard i said he
was killed in self-defense never mind
why or by whom but ft wasnt mur-
der i had to be sure that i was clear
on the yard shooting as far as the po-
lice are concerned and now that im
sure i can go on george will it con-
vince you that i didnt kill yard if i
prove to you that i didnt kill lily and
schneider

  i felt miriam against my side she
readied for my hand and i squeezed
hers ursula and kerry watched me
with a kind of breathless hope and
george suddenly looketl more curious
than angry

  what sort of proof george asked
skeptically

  ive a beginning here-an equation
worked out against each suspect out
of a pocket i pulled a sheet of paper
torn from a notebook i wrote it out

neatly this morning in an albany beer
joint i extended the paper to george

  mathematics he grunted so
thats all you have and he did not
accept the paper

  kerry came forward to take it from
me once more he was the skipper the
man of action here was something
tangible to be looked at examined
they crowded about him miriam and
ursula on either side and then even
george kerry held the paper out so
that they could all read the marks on
paper which said

  which of the suspects will satisfy the
linear equation with a single unknown
which results from the following hypo-
theses

  let x  the suspect

  let kl  knowledge of alecs
movements before lilys murder

let ks  knowledge of alecs
movements before schneiders murder

  let ol  opportunity to murder
lily

  let os  opportunity to murder
schneider

  let ml  motive to murder lily

 let ms  motive to murder
schneider

  let ma  motive to frame alec for
both murders

  therefore

  x  kl  ks  ol  os  ml
 ms  ma

tzerry raised his eyes from the
paper frowned at me and con-
tinued to read or reread it ursula ap-
peared to be concentrating furiously
trying to make something out of what
was beyond her scholastic knowledge
miriam gave it up she came to me
and hugged my arm and waited for the
answer which would mean life to both
of us

  let me explain it i said into the
silence im no longer bitter because


mammoth mystery

you believed i was a murderer and
that you still believe it you george
put it into words weeks ago-that the
odds against me being so completely
intricated in lilys murder through
coincidence or accident were too great
when schneider was murdered under
similar circumstances the odds were
multiplied with each other and became
overwhelming as i knew that i was
innocent i concluded that both mur-
ders were deliberately planned to im-
plicate me there you have the terms
kl and ks which limit x the suspect
to those persons who were in this house
during the card games on the two
saturday nights of the murders which
brings us to ol and os everybody
who was here the night lily was mur-
dered could have beaten me to the
bungalow os eliminated miriam and
ursula they were here when i drove
away but the rest had already de-
parted as for ml and ms-a num-
ber of you had reason to hate lily or
want her out of the way and there
could have been other motives that i
was unaware of ml was the least
fixed of all the terms just as ms was
the most definitely fixed on the reason-
able assumption that schneiders mur-
der flowed out of lilys that he was
killed because he had seen who mur-
dered lily and tried to capitalize on it
in effect ml and ms are connected
terms satisfy the first and the sec-
ond is automatically satisfied

  symbols and words  george ex-
ploded anybody can write an equa-
tion

 give alec a chance kerry
snapped at him he looked at me
where does the ma term come in i
cant see it

  that was the crux of the equation
i said it had me stumped for a long
time ma flows inevitably from the
other terms motive for mortally hurt-

ing me not killing me george once
pointed out to me that it would have
been simpler to kill me than to erect
an elaborate framework of guilt around
me conceivably the killer slated me
as the scapegoat the fall-guy but the
delicate timing involved made it a lot
more dangerousthan killing me - or
both lily and me if that was the idea
-and then sitting tight thats still
the most foolproof way to murder
somebody-shoot or stab and go home
no x was somebody who hated me
but had reason for not wanting me
dead or not wanting me dead by his
own hands

  george sneered q e d but ob-
viously you didnt have confidence in
this equation you fled after you shot
schneider

  after schneider was shot i cor-
rected him mildly

 you fled an innocent man
doesnt

  he does if he has to depend only
on himself to fight for his life i had
had a taste of what lawyers did to me
once i was in jail i needed time and i
needed more information i wasnt
dealing with fixed values but i could
try to fix them as nearly as possible

  how did you fix values by going to
new york and killing don yard

j refused to let his anger get un-
der my skin i went to new york
because i had to go somewhere it was
as good as anywhere else and don
yard was there i didnt think that
he-or even less likely bertha kale-
man-had murdered lily kl and ks
excluded them but not wholly co-
incidences occur however improbable
they both had plenty of reason to do
away with lily and at the time yard
was the only one i could think of who
hated me enough to frame me i had
to be sure of facts concerning him be-
the spider lily



fore i could limit the equation to kl
and ks and i learned that he and
bertha were on cape cod the night of
the murder but that was only part of
what i was after-the least part yard
had maintained some sort of contact-
for all i knew intimacy-with lily
while i was overseas and there was a
chance that he or bertha or walter
could supply me with information which
would help i did get something from
bertha a sort of proof of the equation
somebody in west amber threatened
lilys life a couple of days before she
was murdered-somebody who was not
a lover or had any personal relation-
ship with her

  my throat was dry i swallowed
and sent a smile to miriam she leaned
against me hugging my arm her face
lifted to me was filled by her grave
black eyes

  who is it she whispered

  thats it - who george said
and giving me a name wont be
enough therell have to be a lot more
than mathematical gymnastics to stop
me from going to the police

  all at once my new-found self-as-
surance was gone i felt tired drained
of emotion i had thought that kerry
would help me and that george a law-
yer would advise me but that was no
good i had to depend wholly on my-
self as i had all along i couldnt be
sure that the thing i needed was there
and i had to be before i brought the
police in it was still exclusively my
job

  id like you to tcy to work out
that equation i said you should
be able to do it with what explanation
ive given you if you get the same
answer i did it will be some sort of
proof meanwhile ill go upstairs to
shave and change my clothes

  george didnt protest he stood on
one side of kerry and ursula on the

other all three absorbed in the paper
miriam went upstairs to me

  listen-im sneaking out of the
house i said to her when we stood in
front of my door i dont know how
long ill be gone thirty minutes or a
lot longer

  she pressed against me darling
can you really convince the police that
youre innocent

  i think so there are two ways of
doing it ill try the easiest first if
i fail in both-

  what will you do

  i dont know but ill come back
here before i decide

  who is it why cant you tell me
it would hurt her time enough for
that later-if there would be a later for
us

  youll find out soon enough i said
what i want you to do is watch
george keep him here until i return
dont let him go to the police or phone
them

  ursula will help me if necessary
she could always handle him hes so
devoted to her that he came here to-
night to talk it over instead of going
straight to the police hes going
through hell wanting to do the right
thing

  george is a good guy i said
now go downstairs and tell them im
shaving and dressing

  she would not release me i kissed
her and gently unwound her arms from
about me and went into my room

  i stopped only to get a flashlight
from my drawer as i had several
weeks ago i climbed through a win-
dow and down the ground by way of
the porch roof kerrys and georges
cars were in the driveway i could
have borrowed either but george would
hear the motor and think i was fleeing
a second time it was a nice night for
walking


mammoth mystery

chapter xx
 e d

por a long minute i stood on the
road recalling where each room in
the sprawling house was located the
only light was in the largest of the
wings the living room a voice drifted
out to me unctuous modulated - a
radio voice

  a lopsided moon provided too much
light i walked a short distance back
the way i had come and squeezed
through an opening in the boundary
hedge even then the dark windows i
wanted to reach were a good seventy
feet away across a stretch of lawn
broken only by a cluster of snowball
shrubs i made it in two spurts the
first to the shrubs the second to the
double casement windows

  the windows were open but the
double screens were fastened by a hook-
and-eye i didnt have to go inside if
i could see enough of the room from
outside i put my face against the
screen what moonlight trickled in
made distorted shapes of the furniture
and stopped short of the walls i tried
my flashlight but the screen mesh re-
stricted the beam there was nothing
to do but enter the room

  that was easy the blade of my
pocket knife slid between the screens
and lifted the hook from the eye i
swung the screens inward and climbed
through and swept my flashlight about

  this was the room they used to go
to when they wanted to get away from
the rest of the house to study or hold
bull or hen sessions with considerable
affectation they called it the library be-
cause of the two glass-door bookcases
which held ancient and unread volumes
for the rest they had put into it what-
ever furniture they had no use for else-
where in the house a scarred desk a

treadle sewing machine a horsehair
sofa a cracking brown leather chair
on the wall hung a pair of boxing
gloves crossed sabers inherited from a
remote civil war ancestor and a rifle
on pegs

  hie radio voice strained by the
length of the heuse was overlapped by
a woman calling from another room
where did you say you put it the
reply was an indistinct mumble

  i snapped off the flashlight and stuck
it into my hip pocket i had found
what i expected or hoped to find the
rest was up to the police

  i was halfway back to the window
when the door behind me opened i
whirled moonlight was brighter in the
room than it had appeared to be look-
ing in from outside and i could see
the door closing and the white-shirted
shape standing there with its back to
me in the sudden stifling stillness i
heard the thin grating sound of a key
turning in the lock

rjhere was perhaps time to flee
through the window but the
thought was discarded as soon as it
crossed my mind i could not give him
the chance to dispose of the one physi-
cal link between himself and murder

  then he was turned to me his face a
pale blob and his hands were pale too
in moonlight the right hand was
raised holding something long and the
lower half of it not as dull as the rest
a carving knife probably-bigger and
dealier than the steak knife he had
driven into lilys heart

  he must have seen me cutting across
the lawn and had gone outside to watch
me enter this room or had listened at
the door and heard me enter

  within the drawing of a breath he
cut the distance between us in half it
was not a large room and now we stood
facing each other across five feet of
the spider lily



space too late to flee now he would
get me between the shoulders as i
scrambled through the window we
were bound to this room to settle it
here within the next minute or two the
mathematics of our lives reduced to the
lowest common denominator he or i
he killed me or  killed him by turn-
ing him over to the police

  he leaped i jerked myself side-
ways away from the knife and i felt
the blade rip through jacket sleeve and
shirt sleeve there was no pain but a
scream compounded of fear and shock
and rage tore from my throat

  the fury of the knife-thrust had
taken him past me momentarily i was
behind him i managed to get my
hands on his right arm below the elbow
he wheeled pushing his shoulder
against me my grip loosened caught
again at his wrist and held on

  the next minute or hour or year lost
detail always his breath was harsh in
my face groaning and swearing and
sobbing as he strove to free the knife
my job was to wrench it from him or
turn it against his own body i could
do neither

  we were on the floor then myself on
top clinging to his wrist while he
clawed my mouth and nose and chin
with his free left hand a chair was
on my legs we must have knocked it
over when we had fallen though i
didnt remember blood was in my
mouth i dropped flat on him and
pushed my face into his chest to pro-
tect it he pulled my hair and i
hear myself scream and then i became
aware of those other soiuids

rjhey were on the other side of the
locked door impotently rattling the
the knob and pounding on the panel
they were shouting too begging him to
open the door begging him to tell them
what was happening

  suddenly somebody was in the room
with us cut it out you guys he
said like an adult breaking up a fight
between two kids oh he was a comed-
ian all right cut it out he said and
so we would stop and straggle up to
our feet and each accuse the other of
having started it

  except that he couldnt stop unless
with my death he made a final ef-
fort heaving up against me with all
his strength tearing at my hands on
his wrist trying to reverse the point of
the knife and drive it into my body
the knife i gasped

  i felt hands move down my arms and
over my locked fingers and to that other
hand and the knife in it i lifted my
head moonlight glinted on the cap-
tains bars on the newcomers shoulder

  abruptly the man under me sub-
sided he was finished and he knew it

  ive got it kerry said his shape
rose and left us

  my hands were still a vise around
that wrist which could no longer harm
me i loosened them and pushed my-
self up to my feet he too was rising
his gangling form reached a sitting
position and then remained like that
immobile and bowed in defeat

  light flooded down from the ceiling
kerry turned from the switch did
he hurt you

  three of my fingers fitted into the
hole in my jacket sleeve where the blade
had sliced through my skin was un-
broken i had a headache and my
clawed face burned but i felt fine
no major damage i said and this
is one time i dont complain because
you were right behind me

  he lifted his hand to look at the knife
in it only this time i came before a
killing instead of after

  through the door panel an anxious
voice shouted kerry is that you
why dont you let us in


mammoth mystery

  for a moment kerry looked as worn
and shaken as if he had just stepped
out of a bomber after a combat mis-
sion it would be hard enough for me
to face them and tell them but kerry
was engaged to marry helen then
the square jaw set the clear eyes hard-
ened he turned the key in the lock

  the door flew violently inward
oliver and helen spencer burst into the
room

rjhey stopped dead as if both were
controlled by a single mechanism
their eyes swept past kerry past me
and came to rest on bevis sitting on
the floor with his torso pushed into it-
self

  whats alec doing here helen
said to nobody in particular she de-
tached herself from her father and
dropped down beside her brother
bevis what happened

  bevis spencers somber tragic face
lifted dully and then sagged into his
hands let me alone he moaned
go away from me

  are you hurt what did he do to
you

  let me alone

  mr spencer was staring at the knife
kerry held along his thigh kerry you
tell us he said quietly

  i dont know much more than you
do sir you saw me come into the
house while you and helen were pound-
ing on the door i ran outside and
climbed in through that window i
found them fighting and took the knife
away from bevis

  bevis had the knife mr spencer
whispered

  yes kerry made a feeble motion
with his hand and the knife left it and
fell on the desk

  whose knife is it mr spencer
said did alec bring it with him

  it was time for me to get into it

there was a frog in my throat i
cleared it and said it must have
come from this house bevis tried to
kill me with it

  helen laughed and stood up it was
a sound more dreadful than the moans
trickling through bevis fingers oh
sure everybody is always killing ex-
cept alec she said he killed lily
and her lover and now he wants miriam
and he came here to kill bevis because
bevis asked her to marry him he
kills everybody whos in his way
oliver spencer kept looking down at
his son as if trying to recognize him
is that how it was bevis

  bevis lifted his head and dropped it
in that moment mr spencer became an
old man he shuffled to the desk and
stared down at the knife

  what are we waiting for helen
said harshly im going to call the
police she started toward the door
moving between kerry and myself
neither of us stirred

  wait her father said thinly
this is our carving knife

  she spun at the door the peaches
left her round face the cream clotted
she dug a hand into kerrys arm
darling what does all this mean
alec knows the answers he mut-
tered

  i no longer felt fine this was the
business of the police but it hadnt
worked out that way

  bevis murdered lily and emil
schneider i said

      spencer turned from the
knife on the desk and looked
down at his son sitting broken and
without protest on the floor bevis si-
lence his position all of him was a con-
fession

  why do you say that alec mr
spencer asked me quietly

  id rather save it for the police
the spider lily



  let me hear it first

  he was entitled to the facts to know
that there was no loophole that could
save his son i said kerry have you
the equation

  kerry dug the folded sheet out of a
pocket and gave it to me when i
turned from him mr spencer had
dropped down on the horsehair sofa and
was abstractedly patting his bald pate
his face was empty he reached out
a bony hand for the paper and fumbled
out his reading glasses bevis moans
had stopped but his head remained
bowed helen left kerry and sat down
beside her father and together they
read the paper

  the silence was like physical pain i
felt that i had to break it or suffocate
i asked kerry if the equation had
brought him here

  more or less he spoke in the
husky undertone people use at funerals
george and i worked it down to one
of the spencers i went upstairs to
ask you a couple of questions about
it miriam tried to keep me back so
i suspected something was screwy
when i found youd left the house i
thought that whatever you were up to
i ought to be in on it i tried this place
first

  whats george winkler doing

  i left him talking with ursula and
miriam theyll hold him there till
you get back he thinks i left to keep
a date with helen

  mr spencer looked up from the
paper what does this gibberish
mean

  so i explained the hypotheses to him
and helen they didnt get it i took
out a second sheet on which i had
worked out the equation against the
various suspects and handed it to him

  i had to limit my suspects in some
way i said and at the last i con-
sidered only those who had been in

ursulas house the night lily was mur-
dered ursula miriam kerry george
winkler owen dowie helen bevis
and you ursula and miriam had
knowledge of my movements before
each murder and conceivably had rea-
son to murder lily but os and ma
dont cancel out against their names
they couldnt have murdered schnei-
der theyd been in the house when id
left and id driven straight there and
of course i couldnt see either of them
wanting to hurt me

  as for sheriff dowie he wasnt at
the second poker game so ks dosent
cancel out and as far as i know ml
and ms and ma dont kerry and
george winkler both with full knowl-
edge and opportunity are left with ml
and ms and ma the motive was the
tricky part the most unfixed of the
terms there could be facts beyond
my knowledge but i had to go along
with what i had

  finally you three spencers helen
saw her father knocked down by don
yard because of lily and perhaps for
that and other reasons hated her it
doesnt matter she wasnt at the
house just before schneiders murder
so ks doesnt cancel nor does ms you
mr spencer and bevis were in both
poker games and had opportunity
after each of them and resented or dis-
liked or hated lily because of what
she was doing to helen not strong
motive for murder but assuming it was
sufficient neither of you cancelled out
ma why should you or bevis or
anybody want to frame me that
was the chief snag until a few days
ago

tt was awful the way they looked

  at bevis and listened to me i
didnt want any of it i hadnt from
the beginning and this the end of it
was somehow the worst


mammoth mystery

  kerry was sitting on the sofa beside
helen now he held her hand dry-
eyed staring vacantly she sagged
against his side

  miriam kerry said softly is
that it

  i nodded i was that kind of fool
or maybe not such a fool because since
childhood miriam and i had lived like
brother and sister wed been so close
together growing up together that
there was none of the newness and
curiosity of a man suddenly coming
upon a woman anyway as far as i
was concerned after the trial ursula
said i ought to be spanked i didnt
know what she meant though just be-
fore that shed told me so had others
but it didnt register we loved each
other sure like fond brother and sis-
ter it was a stranger robin magee
who opened my eyes suddenly i saw
that miriam loving me wanting me
satisfied the equation

   laughed shortly bitterly through
my nostrils that was the way love
came to me first objectively - in
effect mathematically that night i
dreamed about her and when i awoke
i realized that all along lily and every
other woman i had known had only
been substitutes for miriam

  bevis stood up our eyes swirled to
him fixed on him he clenched his
fists and swayed

  dont say anything his father
warned him

  bevis mouth went slack he turned
and bent his gangling body to straight-
en the overturned leather chair we
watched his awkward uncoordinated
movements one foot of the heavy
chair dropped on his toes he cursed
without passion without feeling then
he drew in a ragged sob and sank into
the chair and lowered his head

  do you base your accusation on
this nonsense mr spencer said

his face was suddenly sharp calcu-
lating-the face of a shrewd busiriess
man who was weighing a deal

  perhaps its nonsense i told him
its not real mathematics but mathe-
matics teaches you how to think
straight i could have worked it out
another way but because im a mathe-
matician i used this method it wasnt
meant to convince anybody but my-
self that was enough bevis loving
miriam had powerful reason to want
me out of the way his name is the
only one to cancel out ma the only
one that completely satisfies the equa-
tion theres a law called the economy
of hypotheses if you have a hypothe-
ses that satisfies your case you dont
go looking around for another hypothe-
ses

  on paper mr spencer said fight-
ing back now

jt fits and nothing else does
i said we can go back far to
get to the beginning of it probably to
the time when we were high school kids
and bevis was in love with miriam and
miriam with me and  for a while with
helen or start with helens friend-
ship with lily and the inability of her
father and brother to break it up or
maybe it was the impact of don yards
fist against your jaw mr spencer
yard knocked you down but it was
lily who was to blame that was the
ultimate outrage the unendurable in-
dignity to family pride you could
take it tight-lipped and hope to avoid
scandal but bevis brooding and in-
tense had to do something about it
when helen told him not kill lily
of course the motive as i said was
weak-at that time but he went to
lily and threatened her if she didnt
stop trying to make helen a tramp like
herself whatever he said frightened
her so that she made a phone call to
the spider lily



don yard for protection she neednt
have worried she would have been
safe enough from bevis if my home-
coming had worked out a little differ-
ently

  bevis made considerable headway
with miriam while i was overseas
she liked him and probably she would
have married him if i hadnt existed i
had a wife i should have been out of
the way an obstacle removed but it
was obvious that the marriage couldnt
last sooner or later i would be free
again miriam was waiting for that
bevis thought which was why she
didnt accept him maybe my own
opinion is that miriam just didnt
care enough for him

  he may have considered killing me
when i returned but he was no fool
to begin with it would be too obvious
a pattern would be formed-a rival put
out of the way even if he got away
with murder the truth would occur to
miriam or one of the others who knew
how matters stood and the chances
were that my death would solve noth-
ing that she would remain faithful
to my memory and not marry him or
anybody he himself would react that
way to miriams death so why wouldnt
she to my death

  no there was no plan in advance
the idea must have come to him full-
blown when i broke up the poker game
nd rushed to lilys bungalow he
had time to think of all its aspects
while he drove his father home it had
everything it was perfect id be
jailed or executed as a murderer miri-
ams love for me would be destroyed
shed accept him on the rebound and
the fact that it was lily he had to kill
in order to work it was a great deal in
its favor

  there was danger delicate timing
necessary but he was a good gambler
miriam was certainly worth any risk

after he dropped his father off he
drove to lilys bungalow beating me
there with plenty of time to spare en-
tered through the back door picked up
a steak knife on the way through the
kitchen plunged it into her heart
wiped the knife handle drove on to
ursulas house and was with miriam
when news of my arrest came he
couldnt have known that sheriff dowie
and then kerry would go to the bunga-
low and find me there but that hadnt
been necessary there was enough
circumstantial evidence against me
without their arrival just as there
would be weeks later when he murdered
emil schneider but that was a bit
of additional luck

  luck bevis uttered a sound that
was something like a laugh and some-
thing like a sob

  helens face was pressed against
kerrys shoulder she slid it along his
sleeve to face her brother bevis tell
him he lies why dont you tell him
he lies

gain bevis made that bitter hope-
    less sound

  dont say anything mr spencer
told him he looked at me with that
calculating expression he had assumed
after the initial shock is there any-
thing more alec

  not much i said he had luck
then but not later i was acquitted
i was free in more ways than one free
of lily free to marry miriam bevis
had outsmarted himself and more
bad luck - schneider had seen him
leave lilys bungalow he needed
money and bevis had to pay up then
schneider got scared he knew that a
man asks for death when he blackmails
a killer there was nothing left to hold
him in west amber so he planned to
get out of town as soon as possible
then i came to him and he saw a


mammoth mystery

chance to pick up more money before
he left

  i returned to the poker game to get
the money bevis of course realized
why i wanted five thousand dollars in
cash only recently he had needed
cash for the same purpose he had to
protect himself not only that but he
saw a chance to try again to erect a
frame around me once more i didnt
leave the house until some time after
the game broke up bevis was waiting
at the side of schneiders porch he
saw my car pull up saw me approach
and he called to schneider who was in
the house schneider also having
heard my car and thinking he heard
me call his name came out and died
nonsense mr spencer said
complete and utter nonsense his
narrow shoulders were straighter he
managed to smile thinly to his son
the fight has upset you hasnt it
bevis thats why youre acting like
this alec comes here with a cock-and-
bull story and not one scrap of real
evidence

  god bevis moaned oh god
his head fell on his arms

  im sorry i said meaning it sor-
rier for mr spencer and helen than i
had ever been for myself theres
evidence and bevis knows it that
rifle on the wall

   they stared at it as if they had never
seen it before it hung where it had
hung for years above the ornately
carved mantle

tt was a winchester bolt action
rifle a sweet job which could be
used for woodchuck or deer depending
on the power of the cartridge my 
was no good for big game and on the
two or three occasions we had gone
hunting together he had generously let
me carry the rifle part of the time i
had never been lucky enough to spot

a deer when i had it for that matter
in all the years bevis had had that rifle
he had rot been able to bring down a
deer either the rifle had never killed
anything bigger than a raccoon until it
had killed a man

  bevis you fool mr spencer
shouted

  what else could he do i said i
more or less expected to find the rifle
here because i expected bevis to show
sense he had no chance to prepare a
weapon when he decided to kill schnei-
der he had to work fast before i
reached schneiders house so he
grabbed the only weapon at hand
naturally after hed fled from me hed
watch the house from the woods to see
what i would do he saw kerry come
up less than a minute behind me at
once the rifle became a burden a prob-
lem he couldnt leave it in the brush
and later tell the police i had stolen it
from him for he couldnt know that
kerry hadnt been close enough to see
that i hadnt shot schneider so he
had to take it away with him

  then he learned that i had fled and
that kerry had seen nothing it was
too late to take the rifle to the scene of
the crime and leave it there he was
stuck with it for many years it had
hung on that wall a conspicuous and
treasured possession questions might
be asked if it disappeared the night
schneider was shot dead he could
not afford questions anything at all
pointing to him and they were un-
necessary replace it where it had al-
ways been unnoticed by its very pres-
ence and later when the hunting sea-
son started take it out and say he had
lost it the police were devoting them-
selves exclusively to the hunt for me
there was no hurry and then sud-
denly he saw me cutting across the
lawn and knew what  was after this
would be it
the spider lily



jphe three of them on the sofa kept
    staring at the rifle

  and if bevis hadnt left it here
mr spencer muttered

  i would have tried something else
i said i suppose you and helen hate
me now but i didnt do this to bevis
he did it to himself and to me and to
you i was prepared to be ruthess i
would have got him off alone or with
somebodys help and forced a confes-
sion out of him you see how hes
gone to pieces the intense kind like
bevis easily does it wouldnt have
been nice but nothing about this was
nice

  mr spencer took a long time get-
ting to his feet he didnt look at his
son or at anybody his slight body
had shrunken to loose skin over a
framework of bones he shuffled past
me and out of the room

  bevis appeared to be asleep with his
head on the arm of the leather chair
he wasnt helens face pressed
against kerrys chest wasnt visible
either gently kerry stroked her hair

  its not pleasant for you kerry
said to me youd better go

  the rifle-

  ill see that its here when the po-
lice come

  i said im sorry

  sure we all are

i nodded and went out of the room
i didnt have to call the police
oliver spencer was in the hall crouched
over the telephone table is this the
state police he said my son-

  i kept going it was a clear mild
night the high lopsided moon had
the sky to itself i pulled my flash-
light out of my hip pocket and walked
home to miriam

memorial to murder

trobably the only memorial tablet ever to
 be placed beneath the surface of the sea is one
commemorating a murder it was established in
honor of capt james cook world famous navi-
gator

  cooks entire life from his first entry into the
british navy at the age of  was devoted to
exploration and many of his discoveries practically
changed the map of the world

  it was during cne of the most notable of his
exploits that cook met his death in february
 he rediscovered the sandwich islands now
known as the hawaiian islands during the ex-

pedition one of the boats was stolen supposedly
by native islanders cook ventured ashore to seek
its restoration and to better his demand he at-
tempted to seize the native chief and hold him as
hostage in the fight that ensued cook was mur-
dered

  fifty years after his death the bronze tablet was
placed at the spot where the slaying took place
the waters of kealakekau bay wash over it and
sometimes conceal it from view but at low tide
the tablet is easily visible beneath a few inches
of shallow water

answer to back cover puzzle

the detective was able to say the proprietor of
- the jewel shop had faked the robbery from
observing the following clues

  	the debris from the-hole in the wall is al-
most entirely on the empty office side

  	because mr abdullah is a wholesale jeweler
dealing only with iccredited retailers there would
be no opportunity for a burglar to case his
place of business for that reason the chances of
a burglar breaking a hole through the wall at the
very point where there were no wall cabinets are
almost impossible

  	the hole is so small that a burglar would

have found it practically impossible to wriggle
through

  	the plaster strings loose bricks and crumbled
concrete around the hole would certainly have
been scraped away by anyone crawling through

  	only the man who owned and operated the
business would have known which of the cabinet
drawers to break open an outside burglar would
have broken into many drawers instead of just
the three key ones

  	the carpeting shows no powdered plaster
footprints while anyone forcing a way through a
wall would be bound to get the powdered plaster
on his shoes thus leaving prints on the carpet
robespierre

mass murderer of france

  during the bloody days of the french revolu-
tion the name of robespierre was on everyones
lips women looked at his frigid mask of a face
and regarded it as handsome as that of a greek
god men idolized him as well and there were
many more who lived in utter terror of him

  this man was born in arras france in s
the son of a local judge in school he proved to
be a very thorough and ambitious student winning
a much-sought scholarship to a college in paris
where he studied law

  robespierre was slow to make friends he was
awkward and provincial among the dandies of
paris his persona conduct always remained
above reproach day after day he rose early
dressed with care devoted himself to his studies
and in the evenings submerged himself in the writ-
ings of rousseau

  inwardly he was the most gentle of men ap-
pointed as criminal judge in the diocese of arras
in  he was unable to carry out his duties
in order to avoid pronouncing the sentence of
death robespierre resigned his post

  had robespierre lived in other than revolution-
ary times his imprint on history might have been
entirely different but in those hectic turbulent
days he emerged a fanatic of the most dangerous
sort to this day his actions and the reasons
prompting them remain shrouded in mystery

  robespierre believed in the doctrines of rous-
seau on the rights of man he was convinced that
rousseaus doctrines would regenerate france

  he was in versailles in  at the meeting of
the states-general while the constituent assem-
bly drew up a constitution robespierre turned
from the assembly of provincial lawyers and
wealthy bourgeois to the people of paris he
spoke frequently in the constituent assembly and
was eventually recognized as a leader of a small
body of the extreme left

  when he instinctively felt he was making little
headway in the assembly he turned to the jacob-
ins a group of extremists although he was a
poor speaker and uncomely in appearance he had
the power of appealing to the instincts and emo-
tions of the masses to stir them to hatred

  soon his voice was heard above all the others
of the revolution urging the inhabitants of the
paris slums to avenge themselves for centuries of
oppression and maltreatment

  robespierre stepped in after the bourbon king
and queen were overthrown and became a mem-
ber of the commune of paris he was much too
shrewd to identify himself openly with the first
outbreak of violence but from behind the scenes

he helped spread that panic which swept over
france when the attempted flight of the royal
family the organization of an army of refugees
in the rhine region ancfrumors of fifth column
activities among the remaining nobles had begun
to make people expect to find a spy around every
comcr and a traitor in their neighbors horrfe

  danton was intrusted with the duty of carrying
through the program of wholesale murder and
execution while the virtuous robespierre kept his
hands clean of the sordid business like robes-
pierre the young danton realized that the revo-
lution could not be won without the support of
the slums of paris but that was as far as their
friendship went they hid the knives they hoped
some day to stick into each others back

  robespierre was chosen by the convention of
the committee of public safety and made his
hearers believe that the system of the terror was
a necessary thing all traitors must die he pro-
claimed and the distaste for killing he once pos-
sessed seemed to be buried now

  in  paris ruled france and robespierre
held paris in the palm of his hand the com-
mittee of public safety continued in its work of
liquidating the opposition more than  peo-
ple were done away with in october the queen
was beheaded it was during this period of his
career that he decided the services of danton were
no longer needed and secretly pulled the strings
which arranged the mans arrest and execution

  after danton was removed from the scene
robespierre attempting to banish the insecurity of
his position increased the pressure of the terror
the cobblestones of paris rang loud with the clat-
ter of prison carts on their way to the guillotine
on june  even the appearanre of justice was
laid aside no witnesses were allowed at the trials
and people were done away with secretly

  as the terror-filled days rolled by the lawyer
from arras grew confident his decisions called
for more deliberation now than formerly his
mind was fastened more often on the pretty
eleanore duplay whom he intended to marry
than on matters pertaining to government

  it was not long before the convention lost
patience with him and rose in revolt but the
parisian mob remained loyal robespierre planned
to issue a proclamation to the masses calling for
their support and friends expected this move to
strengthen his position before robespierres name
was penned to the appeal soldiers and gendarmes
under the orders of the convention had forced
their way into his room a few hours later his
neck was severed on the guillotine

robespierre -the man
who controlled france
during her revolution

it was his impassioned speeches that
inflamed the inhabitants of the paris
slums to revolt against the government
