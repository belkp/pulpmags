complete in this issue

chapter i-a white nomad

james wilton was on his way back to sydney from a trip   out
back and had a full load of wool and hides piled up on his heavy two
wheeled dray

   five years before he had come to the then little known land of australia 
for the time was prior to the discovery of gold and it was as a convenient
dumping ground for the convict surplus that great britain chiefly regarded
the territory

   the rumored possibilities of obtaining large tracts of valuable agricul-
tural and pastoral country had attracted wilton from his home in england
and for five years he had been following  pastoral pursuits

   it had been a varied career ranging from shepherding to putting up
fences round the estates of squatters then he had tried carrying and had
traveled far into as yet unexplored country to outlaying stations with his
heavily built dray loaded with stores bringing back to the baby city of
sydney loads of wool and hides

   many were the tales of the dangers of the road in the far back country
both from the wild black fellows and the wilder white outlaws who having
escaped from the control of the jail roamed the unsettled districts and
levied tax wherever they could or slew the people who refused it but so
far wilton had been singularly fortunate and all his experiences of the rough
and ready warfare of early pioneering were yet to come

   there had been a long spell of dry weather in the colony but soon after
he started with his load rain began to fall and fell heavier as he proceeded
 his way

   as he reached lower levels evidences were more and more plentiful of the
bad state of the country until at length he arrived at a place where a lot of
soil had collected and formed a small flat over which the water lay some
inches deep but it was not the water that disconcerted him he knew that

the ground below would be saturated and soft and that the broad wheels of
his dray would sink in it to the axles and that his team would have to strain
and work to the utmost to get the load across on firmer ground on to the
other side the track went right across the flat and the dense growth of the
timber all round utterly precluded the possibility of his making a fresh track
to avoid it he went on ahead and waded into the water the soft spongy
character of the earth below warning him of the danger he ran of getting
bogged if he attempted to drive his team across

   he felt the ground carefully as he splashed across the flat the water
did not reach to his knees and he did not find that his feet sank so deeply
into the mud as he had anticipated had he sunk up to his knees in the bog
he might have been satisfied that the dray would stick  but as he only felt
spongy turf below his feet he was sure that his bullocks could get the load
over safely to wait where he was for the water to go off the flat was to his
mind only trifling with fortune

   swinging the long handled whip with its great length of greenhide lash
he cracked it and shouted to his team till he had the bullocks going at a good
pace towards the treacherous flat the dray sank lower and lower at every
stride of the team slower and slower was the progress made until the axles
were level with the water and wilton knew that nearly a quarter of the
wheels were embedded in the mire

   by that time however the dray was half way across the flat and wilton
thinking the battle already won and feeling the effects of his continuous
wielding of the heavy whip allowed his team to rest and thus he lost the
struggle  for as the dray stood with all the weight of the load pressing down
upon the wheels it sank bit by bit until glancing toward it he saw that the
axles had disappeared beneath the water

   he started at his team using every means known to him to make each
bullock pull its utmost but all in vain though they strained forward on
their yokes until they sank knee deep in the bog the dray refused to move
forward an inch and at last worn out with his exertions he saw that dark-
ness was coming on and that his dray was as firmly embedded as though it
had been buried angry at himself his team and everything else wilton
loosened the animals from their yokes and hastened towards dry ground in
search of a place to camp for the night

   the rain which had ceased during the day now began to fall again his
food and blankets were in the dray and as the first drops splashed around
him when he was half way between the end of the flat and the dray he
turned back he would camp under the shelter of the tarpaulin which cov-
ered the load till the morning and do the best he could with a nip of rum
and some beef and damper until daylight when he reached the wagon again
he clambered up and taking off his sodden boots wriggied under the
tarpaulin

   by the time he had finished his repast darkness had taken the place of
light and the rain beat steadily and monotonously upon the tarpaulin he
put the remainder of his provisions into the bag and stretched himself out as
much as the narrow confined space would permit
the track of midnight	

    well im safe here from floods bushrangers or blacks he thought as
he drew out his pipe and prepared to enjoy a smoke before sleeping when
his pipe was filled he lay down with his head towards the small opening
through which he had crept under the tarpaulin and with his tucker bag as
a pillow he took out his flint and steel to strike a light for liis pipe he
raised the steel to strike when the silence of the night was broken by a sound
that made him lie still and fearful it was the sound of men shouting as they
shout and halloo when they ride round a mob of cattle to round them up

   he slid along until he had his head through the opening under the tar-
paulin the sounds of galloping horses came to him he could also hear the
cries more distinctly and he shivered as he heard them for they were the
loud hoarse shouts of the white man and the shrill keener yells of the black
a momentary break in the clouds allowed a stray glint of moonlight to faintly
illumine the darkness and before it had passed he saw what made him feel
still more fearful 

   his bullocks were charging madly down towards the flooded flat and sur-
rounding them were quickly moving black figures and behind them the
figures of men on horseback in a flash the stories he had scouted came to
his mind only one class of white men traveled with the blacks so rumor
said and those were of a kind worse in every respect than their darker
brethren

   the transitory gleam of moonlight had passed and darkness hid the scene
from his eyes but the babel of sounds came to him and he knew that his
bullocks were being slain and that soon the men he had seen would be seeking
for him and to find him meant at best robbery or probably death for to
the men of his own color who were with the blacks the life of a fellow creature
was even less than the life of a white man was to the natives they at
leasti had some reason for their warfare in the annexation of their country 
but the white outlaws had none and so were the more relentless and the
more bloodthirsty against every one who had not been branded with the con-
vict taint

   wilton pulled the tarpaulin down closely and tucked the loose edge in as
tightly as he could and then crept back to the farthest corner of his crevice
dragging his tucker bag with him and wedging himself in between the bales

   then he waited reviling himself for his folly in traveling unarmed in
spite of all the warnings he had received from his fellows and fearing what
would follow when the attention of the men on the shore of the temporary
lagoon was attracted to the dray

chaptkr ii-native revels

   he had not long to wait the noise of the shouting which reached him
dimly ceased for a while and then a cry nearer and clearer and an answering
shout from the distance told him that his hiding place was discovered he
frantically tried to force himself further between the bales and in doing so
discovered that he could just squeeze himself into a corner where another
bale lay across and as he had thought blocked the end of his narrow shelter


the track of midnight

at the same moment he heard a yell and a voice say something in a language
he did not understand he scarcely dared to breathe as he heard some
one climbing up on the dray

   then there was a lot of splashing and a voice in english exclaimed with
an oath 

     were in luck if its stores

   stores aint packed like that you fool its hides by the smell with
some wool  top i expect here you billy what name   

    baal it me know wilton heard a voice say over his head

   take the tarpaulin off and see the man who had first spoken said
what do we want with a tarpaulin lets find the carrier and see
what hes worth

   he wont have anything worth the taking if hes only got hides on
board unless hell join us

   were too many already for comfort and we dont want no peacliers
round the camp

    well then pot him

    not much we dont want to waste our powder well make him run
and let the niggers spear him as he goes sames we served jim doolan when
he- 

   a sharp exclamation from the other man interrupted the speaker and the
greater distinctness with which wilton heard them speaking told him that the
loose corner of the tarpaulin was found before he heard the man cry out 

    heres his nest and heres his boots

   then the voice sounded almost at his ear as he heard the words 

    come out or ill shoot you

    wilton pressed closer against the sheltering bale and held his breath

    he aint in there one of them said  hes gone ashore to camp and
well round him up

    come out or ill shoot the man cried out again and wilton heard the
click of the spring as the hammer of the firearm was drawn back

    thats wasting powder if you-

    a flash of light and the report of a shot stopped the sentence and a bullet
plunged into the wool bale scarce two inches from wiltons head the smoke
of the powder filled the narrow space and nearly choked him but he pressed
his face against the rough covering of the bale and managed to keep back
he cough which would have betrayed him

    i told you he wasnt in there he heard one of them say angrily

    oh  youre too clever you are here you black thief come down out
of that and look for him ashore the other growled and to wiltons great
relief he heard the man slide down the tarpaulin and splash in the water by
the side of the dray then the voices and the splashing grew fainter and he
breathed more freely

   but he dared not move from his cramped position and remained squeezed
between the bales until he ached in every limb faintly across the water
came the noise of the men and at everj louder sound he feared that a fresh
ttarch was to be made at the dray
the track of midnight



    time passed and still tliere was no token that the men were going to re-
turn beyond the continual noise of their voices which came to wilton as he
squeezed between the bales they were evidently busy over something and
at last the desire to satisfy his curiosity and find out what they were doing
overcame his fear he would creep along the opening under the tarpaulin
and look out if it were too dark for him to see it would be dark enough to
prevent his being seen and even if the moon were shining the men would
hardly be able to see the edge of the tarpaulin move he told himself as he
wriggled laboriously and painfully along the narrow space between the
bales

    with his hands on the tarpaulin he hesitated suppose there were still a
man  top of the load  gently he pushed the edge away until he could
get a glimpse of the water the rain had ceased and as he looked he saw
the shimmer of the moonlight he pushed himself further forward until his
head was almost through the opening and then strained his ears to catch any
sound that might warn him if his fears were correct and there was any one
beside himself on the dray beyond the hum of voices in the distance he heard
nothing and gaining confidence he raised the tarpaulin and looked out

    the water all around him was glittering in the moonlight as it rippled in
the light breeze which was blowing he glanced across to where he had seen
the black figures chasing his bullocks three or four large fires were blazing
and the light from the flames helped the moon in making the immediate sur-
roundings clear to his vision

    round each fire a number of men were sitting and their attitudes and con-
stant movements were enough to tell him what they were doing without the
sight of his bullocks lying still on the ground his team had been slaughtered
and the blacks were holding high revel and were feasting as only blacks
know how to feast he had learned enough of their habits to know that
while anything was left to eat the natives would gorge and that nothing
would draw them away from the feast but a hostile attack from another tribe
but the discovery of his loss and the practical ruination it meant to him wras
too severe a blow for him to realize at the moment the chance of escape he
had while the blacks were reveling in gluttony he could only lie still and
impotently watch the scene before him and rage at his helplessness either to
avenge his loss or remedy his misfortune

   as he lay watching he saw twro men whose clothes suggested that they
were white passing from one fire to the other and evidently urging the naked
blacks to some action they came to the fire that was nearest to the water
and he could see them pointing to the dray one of them stooped and picked
up a blazing brand from the fire and held it out to one of the blacks waving
it at the same time towards the dray

   wilton shuddered as he understood the action the two men doubtless
the two who had already visited the dray- were urging the blacks to wade out
and set fire to it in order perhaps that they might appease their disappoint-
ment at not finding the driver then the absurdity of the thing came to
him what was there to burn beyond the tarpaulin cover 

  it was a little matter but it served to turn the current of his thoughts and
the track of midnight

rouse him to something more than the aimless contemplation of his ruined
prospects supposing that the tarpaulin was the only article which would
burn it would be quite enough to roast him or at all events make his hiding
place so unbearable that he would have to get out of it and in doing so show
himself to the enemy and meet the doom he had already heard suggested
there was not much to choose between the chance of being half roasted and
suffocated or speared as he ran for his life but of the two he preferred to risk
the latter

   he glanced down at the water it was not so very far to slide down and
if he were once in he might be able to conceal himself in the shadow of the
dray until an opportunity offered for him to wade ashore and hide himself
among the thickly growing vegetation he looked towards the fires again

   one stalwart black was standing between him and the nearest blaze his
figure showing conspicuously against the light behind him in one hand he
held a long war spear and wilton saw him turn and hold it towards the fire
when he withdrew it the end was blazing and poising it he sprang forward
and hurled it towards the dray

    forgetful of the possibility of discovery in the face of the new and unex-
pected danger wilton craned his head out to watch the flight of the blazing
spear the aim was straight and it seemed as though the missile could not
fail to strike its target but happily the thrower had put too much strength
into his task and the spear skimmed over the top of the load and plunged
hissing into the water beyond

   a loud shout from the direction of the fires brought wilton back to his
senses and at first he thought that his eagerness to watch the spear had dis-
covered his whereabouts he turned his head towards the shore where his
enemies were gathered and his heart sank

   the blacks were running about from one fire to the other and shouting
and yelling in a wild chorus he felt that he had been seen and that they
were preparing to rush out to him and take him captive and without waiting
to think he slid forward and fell into the water in his fear and dismay he
had let himself go without considering the possibilities of his fall making a
splash and directing the attention of the blacks to his position fortunately
for liim the maimer in which he fell was the only way to avoid splashing for
he glided under the water as silently as an otter would slip from a rock

    as he raised his head above the surface he understood the meaning of the
activity round the fire all the men had seized spears and were preparing
to hurl them with blazing tips at the target their fellow had overshot even
as wilton looked he saw half a dozen of them leap forward and fling the
spark trailing weapons in his direction a fresh danger threatened him

    when he fell into the water he had the good sense to keep his body below
the surface and allow only his head above it but the water was not deep
and he was compelled to stretch himself out to keep his body under cover
the result was that he wtas actually more exposed to danger from the spears
than if lie had remained under the shadow of the wool bales for should one
of them fall near him or upon him it would be more disastrous than to be
baked under the tarpaulin
the track of midnight



   the spears were already in the air when he realized his position and he
struggled round to the back of the dray and for a moment breathed more
freely but only for a moment two of the spears struck the target and
plunging into the tarpaulin cover left the fire brands with which they had
been embellished hissing and sputtering on the top once the tarred cloth
caught fire wilton knew how it would smoke and blaze and even if he
escaped the choking and the heat he could not hope to escape when the
blacks came to gather up the spears which fell wide of the mark

   as the difficulties and perils of his position came one after the other to his
mind he cast about for some loophole of escape if he could reach the
shelter of the thickly growing bush on the shore he might hope for safety
but to stay where he was was merely to court certain death

   he could not see the fires from where he stood under the shelter of the
dray but by the noise he judged the men were still excited and the constant
swish of the spears through the air told him that they were still striving to
set the dray on fire the tarpaulin was already smoking and in almost a
frenzy of uncertainty as to what to do wilton looked around

   gradually the moonlight faded and glancing upwards he saw a big mass
of clouds slowly sailing across the moon it was his one chance to get across
the intervening space of water to the shelter of the bush

   he waited until the cloud entirely obscured the moon and then started
for the shore keeping his body as much below the surface as possible he
was almost within the cover of the shade cast by the dense vegetation when a
terrific shout from the direction of the fires sent the blood to his heart for-
getful of everything save the danger of discovery and in his fear doing the
very thing that was most likely to betray him he rose to his feet and stood
dripping and helpless looking towards the place whence the noise came at
the same moment a ruddy light beat round him and lit up the shadows of the
bush in front of him he glanced over his shoulder the tarpaulin was on
fire

   he turned towards the bush in a wild rush for liberty his foot caught
in a snag and he stumbled forward recovering himself he raised his eyes
in front of him in what before the tarpaulin blazed had been a dark shadow
stood the figure of a naked black fellow with his body streaked with the tokens
of war and his spear poised

chapter iii-battle of the blacks

   wieton momentarily paralyzed with fear and terror stood and looked
blankly at the figure in front of him a renewal of the shouting in the
direction of the fires added to his dismay he took a quick glance round and
saw that he was discovered a score of natives were already in the water
wading towards him with brandished spears and wild discordant yells

   terrified and unnerved wilton plunged forward with a half formed idea
in his mind that it would be better to face one rather than twenty but to his
amazement he saw from every bush the figure of a naked warrior start out
until instead of the solitary black fellow who had first threatened him a


the track of midnight

greater number appeared within the shelter he was seeking than were
approaching him from the other side

    a shrill cry echoed through the trees and as if moved by a single impulse
he saw the poised spears which he had imagined threatened him fly from the
hands of the warriors and soar over his head towards the line of men who
were advancing from the direction of the fires directly afterwards the war-
riors leaped from the shelter and advanced into the shallow water yelling
their short sharp battle cries and beating their small wooden shields with
their nullahs clubs

   they dashed past him and he as promptly sought the shelter the had
left crouching beside the protecting bulk of a big fallen tree he peered
through the low bushes and watched the progress of events

   the men who had rushed towards him when they caught sight of him
stopped directly when they heard the battle shout of the band secreted among
the trees others who had remained on the shore hastened to join their
fellows and when the flight of spears which followed the battle cry reached
the limit of the throw they fell among a crowd of men many of whom
were brought down

    as the band left its shelter the men they were attacking also spread out
into line leaping and splashing in the shallow water while they chanted a
weird battle song and waved their spears over their heads

    suddenly one man leaped to the front of the line and poising his spear
hurled it at the foemeu his action was immediately followed by the rest
and a cloud of spears hissed through the air and fell round and among the
oncoming band

   but the advance was not checked and both sides moved towards each
other beating their shields and evidently intending to fight a hand to hand
conflict with their clubs when a fresh and unexpected force took the field

   with a loud warning shout the horsemen whom wilton had seen when
he first discovered the raid on his bullocks rode into the water the blacks
with whom they were traveling broke from their lines and left the space for
the horsemen of whom wilton counted five to ride upon the opposing band

   apparently doubtful as to the meaning of the display the warriors from
the bush stopped and the horsemen dropping the reins on their horses
necks raised their rifles and fired five men fell and the blacks behind the
horsemen yelled and shouted the sound of their voices raised in victorious
cries and the sight of their five comrades writhing in the water acted upon
the remainder of the band in an exactly opposite manner to what the appear-
ance of the horsemen had done with harsh yells they sprang forward
surrounding the horsemen and engaging the men of their own color at the
same time

    there was a confused melee of figures and a terrible din of shouting and
yelling wilton saw one man fall from his saddle and the horse freed from
restraint plunged and kicked its way from amidst the crowd that surged and
swayed in the fight it made directly for the dark shadow of the bush
where wilton was hiding and he realizing the chance it offered him was
wading out to meet it almost before he understood what he was doing
the track of midnight



   the horse turned towards the fires and he hastened after it forgetting all
else in his haste and anxiety to secure it as it emerged on to the hard
ground he was beside it and catching the loose bridle that hung from its head
he sprang upon its back and urged it forward into a headlong gallop past the
fires where the remains of his team still lay away from the uproar and noise
of the fight into the darkness beyond where he knew the track was that
would lead him nearer civilization and safety

   how long he rode he did not know for the rush of events and the vicissi-
tudes of the past few hours had robbed his mind of everything save the one
paramount anxiety for escape gradually the sounds of the conflict became
fainter and fainter until at last he lost them in the noise of his horses hoofs
the moment he ceased to hear them a fresh fear came to him what if the
fight were over and the remainder of the horsemen were riding after him 
for in the whirl of excitement and fear he did not stop to think that when
he got away from the scene everybody else was far too much engaged in the
struggle to notice him or to take heed whether the retiring horseman
supposing they had observed him were one of themselves or one of the black
fellows who had made the attack

   he reined in his horse and turned his head in the direction whence he had
come the air was still and quiet and no sound came to him to suggest that
the conflict was still in progress  but whether it was because he had ridden
too far or because the battle was over he was not able to decide the mere
fact however that he had checked his wild gallop and exerted himself to
listen to something else than the promptings which had urged him forward in
his fight rousec him sufficiently from the control of his fear to enable him to
note his condition and consider his best course of action

   he was bootless and hatless and his clothes still clung to him in their
chill dampness worse than that he was hungry and with the discovery
that his adventures had not robbed his appetite of its existence came the
memory that he was without the means of satisfying it he felt in the
leather pouch a ttached to his belt in which he carried his pipe and tobacco
and found a sodden piece of the latter but the pipe he had left in the dray
and it was in the dray that there was food as well he thought rapidly as his
mind freed from the confusion and strain of terror began to clear and regard
matters in a quiet rational way

   after passing the flat had he got over it safely he would have been five
days he anticipated before he reached the first station presuming that the
road was not blocked by flooded creeks or impassable bogs now that the rain
had come mounted on a good horse he might cover the distance in two
days under ordinary circumstances but his experience on the flat warned him
that the country before him was heavily flooded so that it might be weeks
before he would be able to get through and how was he to exist under
those conditions two days without not only food but a smoke or a fire
was bad enough  a week would be fatal and there was only one way to
avoid it and that was to go back and see whether the enemy had departed
and whether there was anything left of his dray

   the first tinge of dawning gray was in the sky when at length wilton


the track of midnight

decided upon running the risk which he felt might resul from his return
to the scene he had been so anxious to get away from a few hours earlier

    i should have been all right in the scrub the blades were too much
occupied in their own business to bother about me and as for the white
fellows i reckon they had enough to do with those yelling mobs before the
end of it he reflected  but he was careful to get into the bush and off the
open track as the daylight increased

   as he continued his return journey without liearingor seeing anything of the
contending bands his courage rose and he felt that after all it had been quite
easy to escape from what at the time seemed an overwhelming danger as
he approached the scene of the fight he dismounted from his horse and
leading it until he found a suitable spot he hitched the bridle to a tree and
proceeded cautiously on foot

   when he left the track he had gone well into the bush guiding himself
entirely by what he considered the direction of the flat as it happened he
had gone more to the side than he believed and when he had reached the
stretch of water that covered the flat he was half way past it a chance
opening between the trees revealed it to him and as he crept to the edge of
the water keeping well under cover all the time he found that he was im-
mediately opposite the dray on the other side to that where lie had struggled
ashore

   peering over the bushes towards the place where the fires had blazed the
night before he saw that smoke was still rising gently  but he could not
note any signs of life looking over the water he saw here and there dark
spots while over at the place where the fight had raged when he left he could
make out more dark spots and the slender shafts of spears showing above the
water like sloping reeds

   but there was no sound and no sight of life to be seen anywhere moving
with the utmost caution he crept around the edge of the water until he was
near enough the still smoldering fires to distinctly see what was around
them

   the remains of his bullocks first caught his eye as they lay between the
fires and the water beyond them away towards the bush lay the body of
a horse with spears sticking out all over it until it seemed to be a mammoth
porcupine the fires were reduced to smoldering embers and wilton em-
boldened at the silence that was in the air drew nearer as he did so he
noticed that beyond the horse the body of a man lay on the ground and a
man dressed in european clothes

   he glanced quickly round near to where he was standing one of the
black spots appeared on the top of the water and he was close enough to
know that it was the back of a dead black fellow which just rose above the
surface of the water then all the others were dead black fellows too and
here was one dead white fellow as well

   one he had seen fall himself and the one before him accounted for two
out of the five he walked over to the horse and as he went he noticed the
prints of the horses hoofs in the soft earth they were going both to and
from the water  but the former were smooth impressions while the latter
the track of midnight



were deep scars as though the animals that made them had been madly
charging the dead horse had fallen in its stride and there was the impres-
sion where its rider had struck the ground and also the marks where he had
slipped as he tried to clamber on to his feet before the spear which had
struck him in the back and pierced him so as to stick out a couple of feet
from his chest had been hurled at him

    my side won after all wilton thought as he stooped over the body of
his countryman there was a pistol in the belt and a bag of ammunition
while on the ground between him and his horse lay the bushrangers rifle
wilton hastily gathered them and carried them into the bush where he de-
posited them and returned to the shore opposite the dray prom what he
saw he reasoned that the fight had gone against the white men and their
allies and that they had fled with the victors in full cry after them but
both parties would know of the amount of food that lay round the fires and
it was quite impossible for a black fellow to continue a chase very long while
there was such an opportunity to gorge so he anticipated that it would not
be long before some of them returned and in the meantime he determined to
get what he could

    a closer inspection of the dray revealed the fact that although the cover-
ingof tarpauliu had been reduced to ashes and the top of the wool bales
scorched the load was practically uninjured as wilton waded up to it and
prepared to climb into the narrow crevice where he had left his tucker bag
his foot struck against something solid in the mud he reached down and
found one of his boots and a little way off he came across the other the
pain that he had endured in his barefoot walk through the bush made the
find the more appreciable and when he clambered up on the dray his first
act was to put the saturated articles on his bruised and cut feet then he
gathered his blankets and tucker bag and having put all the provisions he
had into the latter he waded ashore with the lot he returned to where he
had deposited the firearms and ammunition and taking them up pushed on
to where he had left his horse

   he was hungry and fatigued when he arrived there but fearing that the
blacks might return to the neighborhood at any moment he strapped his
 swag  on to the saddle bow and with his rifle slung across his shoulders
and the loaded pistol in his belt he started off again from the scene of his
disaster

chapter iv-barriers on the road

   the sun was high in the heavens before he would allow himself to draw
rein by that time he had ridden some miles away from the flooded flat and
had come to a rocky creek down which the water was rushing with a force
and volume that utterly precluded any idea of fording it he dismounted
and after a briel search found a well sheltered nook high above the reach of
floods even if the creek were twice as full and near which was plenty of
feed for the horse he hastily took off the saddle and swag and having
hobbled the animal so that it should not stray he set to work to make a fire


the track of midnight

and while his billy boiled to arrange as comfortable a camp as lie could
after he had enjoyed with all the avidity of semi starvation a heavy meal
from the contents of his tucker bag he stretched himself out on his blankets
and fell into a deep and heavy sleep

   when he awakened he fancied it was just after sunset and he arose and
went to his fire to fan the embers into a flame he was surprised to find that
it was not only out but cold and he hastened to start another so as not to be
left in the darkness without the companionship of a fire instead however
of the dusk growing darker it became lighter and wilton realized that he
had slept right on from the previous afternoon the fire that was to have
kept him company during the night now served to prepare his morning meal
and when that was finished he started to look for his horse it had not
strayed very far and soon after the sun was up he had it saddled and was
riding along the creek looking for a place where he might safely get across
lower down the stream widened and putting his horse into it he managed
to reach the other side though the current was so strong as nearly to carry
his horse off its legs in the middle of the ford

    directly they arrived at the other side the horse of its own initiative
turned up stream and trotted off as if it were taking a well known road
without paying any particular attention to the fact wilton gave it a free
rein as he filled his pipe he was lighting it when the horse turned in its
course and walked rapidly up a steep rise over which big boulders were
scattered behind one of them it again turned and stopped and wilton
found that he was in front of a narrow opening in the rock

    the meaning of the horses action and the significance cf the opening
flashed into his mind the horse had taken its own road home and had
brought him to the bushrangers lair

   his first impulse was to ride away as fast as he could but on second
thoughts he altered his intention he was armed and at least two of the
gang were killed while the others had ridden away in an opposite direction
after the fight even if they had not also been slain besides he might
obtain some valuable imformation by a brief exploration of the cave

   jumping from the saddle he fastened the bridle where he could easily
seize it if he had to run then with his rifle in his hands and his pistol
loosened in his belt he stepped into the cavern

   he entered a medium sized chamber the floor of which was smooth and
sandy in one corner several rifles stood against the wall with a pile of
saddlery and harness beside them some blankets lay in a heap in another
part while such odds and ends of bush life as one or two axes billy cans and
tin pannikins were scattered about

   its only a temporary camp after all he muttered to himself as he
wandered round the place he pulled the blankets away from where they
rested and in doing so exposed the top of a small keg just showing above the
sand

     if its powder ill waste it and then hurry on to pass tie word to the
police it may be news to them for i never heard of a gang up this road
before  
the track of midnight



   it was powder and near that one keg wilton discovered some more all of
which he carried outside the cave and hid among the boulders on the hill
then he remounted liis horse and rode away back to the ford where he had
crossed the creek carefully noting the situation of the cave as he went as
soon as he reached the ford he struck out for the track and finding it
hurried along towards the nearest station

   he successfully crossed the first two streams he met on his route the
track after he had crossed the second creek turned towards the direction of
the general slope of the country and as wilton rode along he found more and
more evidences of the flooded state of the laud ahead until he could not help
being convinced that he would not be able to travel very much farther but
would have to camp beside some impassable stream until the waters had had
sufficient time to run off

   it was not long before he arrived at such a creek and  its banks he was
obliged to bide as patiently as he could for five days

   by the sixth the crossing was passable though not entirely safe but
wilton was too keen  reaching some place from which he could obtain the
necessary help to enable him to return and rescue his dray from its precarious
position and also from whence he could despatch information to the police
authorities as to his discovery of the hiding place of a bushranging gang

   he struck csmp and with nothing more serious than a good wetting he
managed to get across the stream and pressed forward on his journey

   but that was not unfortunately the only creek between him and settle-
ment and he had not ridden very many miles before he was again compelled
to halt on the bank of a fiercely rushing stream striking out for a short cut
he had come upon the creek at a place where it swerved round a projecting
point the current boiling and eddying in a hundred swirls beyond the point
the stream widened and the high bank on which he stood sloped down while
on the opposite side the bank was high all along he rode down slowly to the
lower point to see whether there was not some means by which he could get
over but it only needed a brief inspection to show him that the feat was quite
impossible in the face of the awkward bank on the other side had it shelved
down the same as that on which he stood he would have swum his horse
over but it would have been suicidal to attempt such a thing with a precipi-
tous bluff affording no foothold as a landing place

   he continued to ride slowly along the bank looking for a likely spot
where his horse would have a chance of emerging if it managed to get through
the current a mile or so further along the stream again widened and the
banks on either side sloped down until they were little above the surface of
the water he was debating whether to risk it or not and glanced back at
the higher point whence he had come and where he had noticed an excellent
site for a camp he just caught sight of two men both armed with rifles
slipping behind the trees

   without more ado he rode his horse straight for the stream the animal
shied and swerved aside at the bubbling water but he dug his heels into its
sides and forced it into the flood he heard a loud cry from the top of the
bank where he had seen the two men and a rifle shot echoed through the


the track of midnight

gullies at the same moment he felt his horse lose its foothold and slipping
his feet from the stirrups he threw himself out of the saddle just as the horse
stumbled forward still holding the bridle he tried to keep the horses head
from turning down stream while both battled with the current and swam for
their lives in spite of their efforts they were swept along and wilton
realized that the only chance that was left for them ever to reach the shore
again was by keeping themselves afloat and trusting to their being carried
near enough to get a foothold or into water sufficiently slack to permit them
to make some progress

    weighted as he was with the rifle strapped across his shoulders he already
felt exhausted and the horse was snorting with fear and fatigue when the
stream narrowed and the current whirled them along like straws he tried
to look toward the banks past which they were rushing but the eddies were
so strong that he was spun round before he could do more than get a confused
blur of high bluffs on every side he felt a tug at the bridle and knew that
it had been jerked from his grasp the horse was out of sight  he heard an
ugly roaring in his ears  there wras a swift vision of blue sky and green
leaves and then a rude blow at the back of his head helpless exhausted
and nerveless he ceased his fight and sank into dark and senseless oblivion

   when wilton recovered his senses he was lying on the ground with a
group of men gathered round him

     where am i   he asked when he had recovered sufficiently to speak

     youre under arrest one of the men replied

     then you are police  wilton asked in a gleeful tone

     not all of us but quite enough so for you the man who had spoken
before replied

     better arrest him properly now that he can understand one of the
group remarked

     thatll do any time another said  weve got to learn a lot first
and there may be trouble with  over the creek there  if wte dont start our
business before they come into it

    there was a murmur of assent from the other men and wilton anxious
to understand all that was going on made as if to sit up two or three of
the men at once forced him down again and proceeded to tie his arms and
legs then when he was securely fastened they propped him up against a
tree in a sitting position

     im not going to run away  he said after vainly protesting against the
indignity

     no more than you ran from the police over the creek   one of the men
said with a laugh

    i never ran from the police they are the very people i want i am
on my way now to warn them wilton exclaimed

     on a stolen horse and under arms  what next  rejoined the other

     hes too old a bird for you johnson let me have a yarn with him

    the speaker wtas one of the men who had not up to that moment taken
any part in the conversation but had stood a silent spectator of all that was
going on wilton looking towards him saw a slimly built wiry man with
the track of midnight



iron gray hair and what was a noticeable peculiarity in the bush a clean
shaven face he approached wilton who noted the closely set thin lips and
the look of fixed determination in the steely gray eyes

    now my lad if you want to save trouble out with it smart where
are the rest of you   he said standing beside wilton and looking down at
him

   there was a domineering tone in the voice which grated upon wiltons
temper

    youd better say who you mean he answered

    keep your tongue civil or youll get more than you ask for the other
said with a frown as he stirred wilton with his foot  we dont waste time
over men of your stamp theres a handjr tree and weve plenty of rope so
just answer my questions properly  where are the rest of you  

    who are you   wilton exclaimed angrily

    im william giles of billali station and a justice of the peace as you
very well know so no more of that nonsense

    never heard of you wilton answered

   i suppose not and that explains how you are found with a horse that
was stolen from my paddocks only a few weeks back

    i can tell you all about that wilton exclaimed  now i know who
you are-

   the men standing round laughed loudly

    now he knows who you are he does not mind talking to you giles 
only dont be too familiar one of them said banteringly

   the frown on giles face grew sterner

    im not going to waste all the day   he exclaimed angrily  where
are the rest of you   

    well there is only my horse besides me or rather your horse as you
say he is yours wilton began when the renewed laughter of the group
interrupted him

chapter v-the squatters turn out

   giles tuined quickly towards them

    is that how to treat one of doolans murderers  he cried savagely

   the laughter ceased at once and one or two of the men muttered some-
thing which wilton could not catch

    we dont know that he is yet the man whom giles had addressed as
johnson said

    and were not likely to either while you let him make fools of the lot
of us giles retorted  if youve forgotten our murdered neighbor i have
not

    let him tell his story in his own way johnson said

    and waste time in listening to a pack of lies and enable the rest of the
crew to get well away giles replied then before any of the others could
speak he turned again to wilton see here he continued weve had
enough of this if you cannot remember we will assist your memory


the track of midnight

   he picked up a length of strong rope which lay on the ground near wilton
and fastening one end to a stone threw it over a branch of the tree against
which wilton was propped as the stone fell dragging the rope with it he
caught it and untied the knot retying it in the form of a noose

    now then you know what thats for  and if you dont tell us where all
the rest of the crew are hiding and how many you are nd all about the
murder of doolan up you go he said

    i cannot tell you what i do not know wilton replied  all i know
is-

    you shall have five minutes in which to remember giles interrupted

    give him a show another of the group exclaimed

    i am a carrier and my name is wilton he went   i was on my
way from caryl downs with wool and hides when i got bogged in the flat
beyond stoney creek a mob of blacks came up and speared my bullocks
the had white men with them and i was escaping when another mob of
blacks appeared and began to fight the first lot then the white men joined
in and one was knocked off his horse i caught the beast and rode away for
my life but as i had no food and all the creeks were in flood i went back
to see if i could get at my tucker in the dray i found that every one had
cleared except the fellows who were killed among whom was a white man
and it was from him i took the firearms wheii i had taken my tucker
and blankets i started off for meleelee station as the nearest place where i
could get help and send word to the police on my way i was stuck up by
the creeks which were running bankers but the horse took me to a cave
where i found a lot of arms and powder that is what i wanted to tell the
police i can tell you where it is you go-

    two minutes gone giles interrupted  three minutes more to tell
the truth or swing  

    this is the truth wilton cried

    what do you say boys  giles turned to the assembled men

      iyies    some one exclaimed

    i should rather think so giles added

    i tell you it is the truth go and see for yourselves wilton retorted

   now listen to me giles went on speaking seriously and with his
brows drawn down in an ugly frown this is no game were playing
youre one of the gang that murdered doolan of meleelee because we
found you with arms that we know by the marks on them were stolen from
his station and with a horse that was stolen from my paddocks about the
same time we give you this chance for your life say where the gang are
hiding and we will let the authorities decide whether you are to swing or
not refuse and we run you up as a warning to let others see that we
squatters are not going to be left to the mercy of every escaped convict whom
the government is too lazy to catch

    thats the talk   a man exclaimed

    go on  out with it johnson said  we mean business

    you said you were police wilton cried

   we know what we said the government can only spare two police
the track of midnight



and they are the other side of the creek so were acting for ourselves over
here now then hurry up giles answered

    i know nothing more than i have told you wilton exclaimed  ill
guide you to the cave and to the flat and then you can see for yourselves
if you dont find what i tell you-

    none of that youll tell us what we want to know or swing giles
interrupted

    perhaps this will help another of the men said as he stepped forward
and passing the noose over wiltons head drew it closely round his neck

    hang on to the slack a bit he cried and johnson seizing it pulled it
until the noose jerked wiltons head forward

    ive told you the truth   he shouted   im not a bushranger  

   another jerk of the rope was the only answer he received but the men
standing round glared at him savagely

     dont  dont   he yelled as the cord tightening round his throat nearly
choked him

   give him another taste remember doolan   giles cried and a
hoarse and angry murmur came from the men johnson jerked the rope
again and giles reaching up caught hold of it too and pulled so hard that
wilton was lifted for the moment off his feet as the weight of his body
come on to the rope the noose drew so tight that it cut into his neck and sent
the blood to his head his eyes started nearly out of their sockets and his
tongue lolled out of his mouth which he opened with the intention of crying
for mercy but the cord was too tight and only a gurgling sound came he
felt as if his head were bursting and thought his last moment had come

   but his tormenters had  intention of letting him die so quickly they
relaxed their hold of the cord and he came to the ground again and lay as
he fell giles loosened the noose enough for him to breath and then stood
over him until he recovered

   as he regained consciousness he also realized the extreme danger he was
in for without knowing the exact particulars of the case he had gathered
enough from what he had heard to know that the men were a band of
squatters out to punish malefactors that the government either could or
would not trouble about

   although it was not known to wilton a band of desperadoes had been
inflicting disaster in all parts of the district through which he was traveling
the leader was well known by repute and was said by all who had had the
misfortune to come within his clutches to be a particularly cold blooded
scoundrel with a long black beard and a big head of hair of the same color
that he was able as well as wicked was proved by the fact that neither he
nor any of his band had as yet been caught though the government had sent
as many as two troopers to carry out the task of dispersing the gang and
arresting or shooting the leader again and again the squatters had turned
out to be averged upon the marauders but always to return baffled and
dejected the most arduous and indefatigable organizer of these expeditions
was william giles and his zeal in the cause had won from the government
the recognition of a local magistracy

      b


the track of midnight

   the most recent escapade of the gang- under the leadership of captain
midnight as he was termed in deference to the color of his hair and beard
had been more than usually daring and irritating to the squatters they had
j ust returned after a prolonged search for the desperadoes when the news was
passed round that fresh outrages had occurred one consisting of the robbery
of a very fine black horse which the squatter leader giles had ridden in the
last expedition aud the other the murder of the owner of meleelee station
the next estate to that which giles owned

   the murder of doolan had been more than usually barbarous the few
men he employed were away from the head station at the time and on their
return they found the unfortunate squatter lying in front of his own door
riddled with spears at first the men regarded the outrage as due to blacks
but they were undeceived by a handkerchief which was tied to one of the
spears aud on which was rudely written iii the blood of the murdered man
 account settled-midnight

   the site of the murderwas named as the meeting place whence the
avenging band would start  the track of the common foe and a greater
number assembled than had been together on the previous and fruitless occa-
sion more than that two troopers who were traveling in the district heard
an account of the tragedy and joined the expedition which started away with
the intrepid giles at the head vowing to give a short shrift to any of the
bushrangers who might have the misfortune to fall into captivity

   for the purpose of meting out summary justice they carried several coils
of strong rope with them  and in order to follow the murderers right up to
their lair wherever that might be they also provided themselves with enough
provisions to last a month

   before they had been many days out the rain set in the creeks flowing
down from the high table land came down  bankers  long before there was
sufficient local rain to flood them and the fact filled the avengers hearts with
glee they knew that higher up there was a perfect network of creeks and
gullies which would seriously hamper in their flooded state the escaping
gang it was evident that blacks were with the outlaws for as the squatters
advanced they found evidences of that in many a token plain enough to their
bush trained eyes so they pressed onward getting over and through creeks
which under ordinary circumstances they wouid have left alone but which
aided by their zeal and the ropes they carried were safely forded

   but that which they anticipated would prove an impassable obstacle in
the path of their retreating foe was also an obstruction in theirs and at last
they arrived at the bank of a creek which was at once seen to be impassable
chafing at the enforced delay they wandered up and down the bank in the
hopes of finding some place where they could get across the search was re-
warded for the scouts who went farthest afield came back with the news that
they had discovered a narrow gorge through which the stream rushed and
over which men could pass with the aid of a rope the most daring of the
band headed by the intrepid giles hastened off to examine the place if
once the rope were stretched they could get across they averred although to
get the horses over was out of the question the two troopers who were with
the track of midnight



the party expressed doubts as to the chance of any one breasting- such a
current but the squatters were mostly young men and they laughed to scorn
the caution of the police nor did they stop at laughing but said so many
biting things about the quality of the troopers strength skill and courage
that the younger of the two blazed up in a rage and said he would prove
them wrong by crossing the stream himself

   the attempt was postponed until the morning and the evening was spent
in debating the best means of carrying out the wild scheme it was decided
that the best course would be for the trooper to take the water as far up the
stream as the length of rope would permit and with two inflated empty water
bags to support him strike out for the other shore in a slanting course going
with the stream as much as possible one end of the line was to be made
fast to a tree and its entire length passed along in a necessarily slow and
tedious fashion on the outside of the trees that grew on the bank up to the
place where he -was to enter the stream

   at daybreak the band repaired to the scene of the proposed crossing and
for an hour or so all were busy helping advising and looking on when at
length everything was in readiness the trooper with the slack end of the
line made fast to his temporary buoys slid into the water and struck
out vigorously for the other side the current carried him along at a rate
that seemed to make it impossible for him to get across before the limit of the
line was exhausted  but he was a powerful swimmer and moreover had his
blood up and the watchers could not restrain a cheer when they saw him
clutch and hold an overhanging tree  the other side of the narrow boiling
creek

   the cheer was rudely checked by the arrival of the man who had
been left in charge of the horses at the camp he galloped up furiously
and breathlessly gave the information that nearly opposite the camp an armed
horseman had appeared on the other bank the baud tried to signal to their
comrade the intelligence and as soon as he had made the line fast it was
pulled taut and his fellow trooper expressed his intention of going next

   with his own and his comrades weapons and ammunition strapped across
his shoulders he started his anxiety to get over and have the first brush with
the outlaws overcoming his prudence he reached the middle of the stream
the line straining at the pressure put upon it suddenly he was seen to shoot
rapidly down the current and a cry of dismay went up from the impatient
watchers the knot had slipped on their side and their frail bridge was
gone

   the trooper clung desperately to the rope and managed to keep afloat
until the current carried him to the bank where his comrade stood then
the squatters watched him as he emerged and realized that they were cut off
from participating in the fray they saw him pointing away to where the
armed horseman had been reported to have been seen and then the two
vanished in the bush

   giles urged an immediate return to the camp for more rope and as he and
his companions hastened along they saw the horseman take the stream
they ran along the bank watching him in his struggles and more than one


the track of midnight

rifle covered him as he was spun round and round in the current they saw
him drift into the extended limbs of a fallen tree which lay in the creek and
get wedged in the fork of one long thin branch it was i the work of a
few minutes for one of them to hasten with a line and tying it round the un-
conscious wilton enable the rest to draw him to the shore then they
waited for him to recover his senses deciding in a brief council of war held
in the meantime to extort from him the secret of the gangs hiding place
before they hanged him on the nearest tree

chapter vi-on the track

   the troopers on the other side of the stream also saw wilton plunge into
the water but before he did so one of them recognized him

   its wilton the carrier he exclaimed to his companion hes
escaped from the gang and wants to give us the tip im sure

   theyll hang him on the other side if they catch him whoever he is
his comrade replied  theyre as hungry for killing as ever i saw men

    then well go back and stop it that giles is a fool at work like this
he always spoils a capture  

   they climbed along the bank until they saw wilton dragged from the
water and later saw the rope thrown over the branch and the noose placed
round his neck they shouted but to no purpose  and at last as they saw
him swung off his feet the younger of the two ran down to the waters edge
and plunged into the current with the intention of swimming over and
saving wilton from the wrath of his captors he was still battling with the
flood when giles let go the rope and allowed wilton to fall to the ground

   with the noose loosened he gasped for breath and tried to plead for
mercy

   tell the truth you fool or up you go and this time not to come
down giles cried and his companions their worst passions roused now that
a victim was in their power crowded round him with horrible threats one
shouted out to burn him  another to flog him  and yet another to bury him
in an ant hill until wilton lost all sense in a wild frenzy of terror that came
upon him

    up with him  up with him   the men yelled and a dosen hands seized
the end of the rope and pulled the unfortunate creature off the ground

    stop  its murder   cried a voice behind them and they turned as
one man and faced the trooper who dripping and breathless staggered
towards them from the creek they laughed harshly as they pulled the
harder and crowding together cheered as their victim struggled in the air
while the trooper hopelessly threw himself against their united ranks

    let him down hes innocent its wilton the carrier the trooper
cried as he strove to fight his -way through the crowd to where giles and
others hung on to the rope but the squatters wrere to much incensed to
listen to any one who talked about liberating the victim whose bod was
writhing in the air in all the contortions slow strangulation can produce

   the men against whom the trooper threw himself easily repulsed him and
the track of midnight



he let his tongue run loose as an aid to his efforts at driving back the crowd
two or three of those who where nearest to him turned upon him and
roughly seizing him sent him staggering back until he tripped and fell
and to that fall wilton owed his rescue for the trooper had stumbled over
a rifle that one of his squatters had thrown on the ground in his haste to lend
a hand at hauling up he unfortunate carrier

   the trooper pickel it up and aiming in that haphazard manner which is
often the most effective pulled the trigger he had acted so quickly and
the men were so engrossed in their work that they were totally unprepared for
the sound of a rifle shot so close to them they started in a momentary
panic each one turning to where he had left his rifle under the idea that the
bushrangers were upon them the bullet struck the rope as it passed over
the branch and the body of wilton dropped down upon those immediately
beneath him had he fallen clear to the ground his career would have ter-
minated at once but his fall was broken and his life practically saved by those
who a moment before had been trying to take it his heels struck giles on
the forehead tearing ugly wound and stunning him two others also
shared the force of hiltons descent and the four lay in a confused heap to-
gether while the remainder uncertain as to whether the branch of the tree
had broken or the bushrangers were upon them scattered for their weapons

   with the now empty rifle in his hands the trooper sprang forward and
pulling the noose looose from wiltons throat stood over the prostrate men
his movements made the squatters recover their wits and understand the
meaning of what had just occurred they realized that their victim had been
snatched out of their hands at the very moment of victory aud their rage
broke out anew with angry shouts they turned upon the trooper he
recognizing the danger of his position brought his rifle to cover the man
nearest him

     stand back or ill shoot   he cried aud the squatters surly and men-
ancing drew back

    this man came to put us on the track of the gang hes wilton the
carrier i know him well and youve nearly killed him the trooper said
excitedly

    he said that but we didnt believe him one of the men whose head
was cooler than the others answered

    thats so johnson exclaimed  it was giles that said the chap was
lying

    the brief conversation was sufficient to turn the anger of the band and as
the trooper stooped over wilton others lifted up the three men who had been
injured by his fall and rlid what they could to restore them

   giles had received he severest hurt his companions in distress recover-
ing in a few minutes but he still lay senseless they bound up the wound
on his forehead but in such a necessarily clumsy manner that when it ulti-
mately healed a scar was left which branded and disfigured him for the rest
of his life his comrades carried him back to the camp and laid him on a
roughly improvised couch and then waited patiently for him to show some
signs of returning vitality wilton was also carried to the same place and


the track of midnight

similarly treated for tlie men were not versed in any of the methods by
which the recovery of both of the injured could have been accelerated a
strong constitution was the remedy for all ills that could befall a man in those
days and if any one were sufficiently unlucky to meet with a hurt when his
constitution was not strong enough to fight and overcome it a hole would be
dug at the foot of a tree the dead mans initials rudely carved on the bark
and the tide of settlement flow on as if it had never been interrupted

    so it was that the men stood or sat around the two patients smoking and
discussing what chance either had of bucking up not because they
lacked sympathy nor because they were indifferent to the lives of their
fellow men but because their constant association with danger in the rough
and tumble of their everyday lives robbed the situation of its solemnity

    wilton was the first to recover and as he opened his eyes and glanced at
the men standing near him he struggled to recall the events which had pre-
ceded the dark shadow that had come across his memory the trooper went
over to him

      hullo wilton how are you feeling   he asked  

  wilton looked at him questioningly	v

   you know me dont you farrell the trooptr who travelled with
you

    yes i know but how did i get here  wilton asked weakly

    oh thats all right tell me all you know about the gang that stuck
you up  

   wilton started up  i remember   he exclaimed  they were going
to hang me  

   well they didnt so theres nothing to get excited about farrell
said

   remembering so much wilton discovered that his neck w as swollen and
sore and that his throat pained him so much that he could only speak with
an effort

     tell me all he said

    farrell gave him a brief outline of what had transpired

      directly i knew who you were i fired to attract your attention but you
rode slap into the stream and came as near drowning ad any man could with-
out finishing the business then the men on this side collared you and in-
sisting that you were one of the gang were going to hang you when i man-
aged to get across the creek and tell them who you were

   giles was more difficult to soothe when he recovered consciousness his
personal injuries were bad enough but the escape of wilton seemed to be the
greatest evil in his eyes he raved and raged at every one swearing that
farrell was in league with the outlaws and that wiltda as ore of them and
finally announced his intention of returning to his home at once and having
no more to do with any attempt the squatters might make to put down the
bushrangers

    the creek was rapidly falling and by sunset the other trooper got across
and joined in the heated discussion which was raging around the camp fire
for under the altered bearing of giles discord had come into the band and
the track of midnight



some were for returning to their homes while others clamored for an imme-
diate advance

   well we go on anyhow whether we go alone or with any of you
farrell said angrily  if you had listened to wilton and acted like sensible
men we could have been miles on the track of the gang by this time

    im with you wilton said

    youre right trooper johnson remarked  we blundered there and
now its only fair to follow your lead

   there was a general murmur of assent when some one turned to giles and
asked what he intended to do

    mind my own business and be done with the lot of you he replied 
and when the morning came and the men made ready for the advance no one
was very much surprised to find that giles had started presumably for home
taking with him his own horse as well as that which wilton had brought
down

   were well rid of him he always upsets the business somehow
farrell said to wilton  hes a man i dont trust

   the fact that giles had taken wiltons horse did not delay the starting of
the party as there were several spare animals  and an hour or so after sunrise
they were riding along the banks of the creek towards a ford which was sit-
uated farther up the rapid rate at which the wtaters were running off en-
abled them to cross with little difficulty and when they halted for the mid-
day meal there were only a few miles between them and the cave that wilton
had found and which was to be the first place visited

   they pushed on as rapidly as possible and were soon on the tiack of
wiltons horse the imprints of whose hoofs were clearly marked in the soft
ground over which he had ridden they had followed them for a mile or so
when a sharp exclamation from the man in front caused every one to ride up
to where he sat on his horse pointing to the ground

   the hoof prints of two other horses had suddenly appeared beside those
that wiltons liorse had made but the were turned in the opposite direction
and were evidently going to and not from the cave

   farrell jumped from his horse and examined them closely

    theyre fresh made he exclaimed as he stood up  forward lads
and well have them before sunset

   the enthusiasm of the band was again aroused and they galloped forward
with their rifles slung ready for use and their ammunition bags handy no-
body spoke but every one kept a keen lookout on all sides as they followed
farrell who had now taken the lead at a hand gallop

   at the ford where the horse had turned aside to go to the cave farrell
reined in his mount and pointed to the ground the rest of the men
crowded round him and looked the double tracks were both going to and
coming from the cave

    they cross the creek johnson exclaimed

    then well push on after them farrell cried

   but opinion was divided and some of the men were for visiting the cave
first in case the track of the horses was only a blind


the track of midnight

    we can follow it till we come to the horses if that is so and with the
horses in our possession we can soon run down the men farrell main-
tained

   further argument was cut short by the troopers aud johnson ridiug over
the ford and even those who had urged that the cave should be visited first
followed

   they had not gone very far on the other side when wilton pointed out
whereabouts the cave was situated and they stopped a moment to look when
a column of white smoke shot up and a dull report echoed among the
boulders

   the men looked at one another in amazement there could be no doubt
about the significance of what they had seen a mine had been prepared for
them in the cave and had they visited it instead of crossing the ford they
might all have been blown to atoms

     theres only one man with enough of the devil in him to lay a trap like
that farrell said  captain midnights not far away ill be bound

   then here goes after him  one of the men replied and the horses
were wheeled round aud set again to gallop along the track

chapter vii-midnight doubles

   they would have arrived at the flat where wilton had left his dray and
where the fight between the natives had occurred by sunset had it not been
for an accident to one of the party which compelled them to delay until all
hopes of reaching the fiat before dark were destroyed

   the track sloped down at a place where the storm water had poured along
it loosening the stones from the soil as the advance of the band rode over
it the stones were still more disturbed with the result that one of the horses
stumbled badly aud threw its rider heavily over its head he was shaken
severely but urged that the remainder should press ou saying that he would
follow at his leisure

    with the explosion at the cave still fresh in their minds the others how-
ever would not hear of such an arrangement

     were after the greatest scoundrel but the cleverest bushranger of the
lot johnson said and our only chance is to keep well together till we get
some idea of how many he has with him he may have a tribe of blacks and
where shall we be then if we are all scattered   

    they decided to wait until their comrade was ready to travel again and it
was soon evident that the wait would extend until the following morning
a convenient site for a camp was chosen off the track and the party divided
into watches for the night a fire was made in a sheltered spot and the men
gathered round it for the evening meal the sun was just going below the
horizon and tli bush was filled with the half light that is so deceptive the
leaders were arranging who should be the first to go  watch when with a
loud mocking shout a horseman dashed out of the bush almost beside them
and riding furiously through the crowd vanished into the shadows of the
bush beyond
the track of midnight



   there was just time to notice the black horse and that the rider was a
thick set broad shouldered man with a black beard and long black hair be-
fore both horse and rider were out of sight

    midnight   every one exclaimed as with rifles hastily snatched up
they scattered through the bush in the direction in which the man had dis-
appeared

   but they might as well have stayed round the fire for all the good they
were able to accomplish both man and horse seemed to vanish utterly and
not even a sound could be heard of the horses hoofs let alone a sight of the
rider darkness was also coming on and with that as an extra difficulty the
squatters soon abandoned their fruitless chase and returned to-the camp fire

   the audacity of the man they were after amazed them and as they stood
round the fire discussing it their words were as much of admiration as disgust
for the utter disregard he had showed towards their number and superior
strength directly they had reassembled guards had been posted round the
camp to prevent a surprise and those who were not required to take part in
the wtatch debated the chances of their being able to capture the leader of the
gang

   we may as well go home one of them said  midnight is said to
know every inch of the country for miles round here and the way he rode
through us and disappeared is quite proof enough for me  

    he must have ridden up very quietly for no one heard him until he
j umped out upon us   another observed

    weve been too careless johnson said  when giles was with us he
always told everybody what to do and they did it  but now that he is awray
everybody leads for himself and i tell you it wont pay while we are dealing
with a man like midnight  

    i believe youre right the man who had first spoken said

     right  of course it is right that business at the cave ought to have
been enough to warn us we should have made arrangements there and
then instead of straggling along like sheep even when we stopped what
was done everybody talked about mounting watches for the night and
while everybody talked nobody acted and the result was that midnight was
able to laugh at us and ride through our camp without a man being able to
fire a shot i vote for a leader and propose trooper farrell

   farrell who had been discussing the situation with his comrade and ar-
ranging that they should share the task of watching the watchers through the
night in order to avoid another fiasco came over to the fire at the moment
having accepted the responsibility of mounting guard for the first half of the
night while his comrade obtained what rest he could he turned toward
johnson as he heard his name

    whats that mr johnson  he asked

   were deciding to follow a leader and ive proposed you johnson
answered

    we want the leader true enough but i would not care for the job sin-
gle handed better take it yourself farrell replied

   the suggestion was warmly accepted by all who heard it and those who


the track of midnight

were not on guard agreed after some further debate to regard johnson as the
leader both on that and subsequent expeditions in the place of giles who had
turned tail at a critical moment and for the present occasion farrell and
wilton were joined in the command the former as lieutenant the latter as
guide

   but the arrangement was made too late  it was a case of locking the
stable door after the horse was stolen the guards were not alarmed once
during the night and by morning everybody thought that the game was up
and that the quarry had escaped

   the proposed leadership was ratified by the assemblage and the first act
of the new command was to despatch a party to follow the tracks made by the
retreating bushranger the night before they soon returned with the infor-
mation that the tracks led to a hard stony patch of country where every trace
of them was lost

   then well push on to the flat and see what can be learned there
johnson exclaimed

   they learned a good deal more there than they anticipated the carcasses
of wiltons bullocks and the bushrangers horse were in an advanced state of
decomposition and the body of the bushranger would have been the same
only it had been almost destroyed by a big fire which had been built over it
and which was still burning the bridle and saddle had also been taken from
the horse

   the water had drained from the flat though the soil was still soft and
muddy and upon it recent impressions of horses hoofs were everywhere evi-
dent johnson farrell and wilton rode out to the dray which appeared
from the distance to have canted over when they came nearer to it they
saw that the bushrangers had vented their spite still further in destroying
what they could not use and had cut through the heavy axle and damaged
the wheels so much that the dray was nothing more than a useless wreck a
fire had also been lit in the space where wilton had camped and the bales of
wool hopelessly damaged

    blind useless destruction johnson said as they viewed the wreck
theres some excuse though little enough for them sticking up stations
for food and money but this sort of business is beyond everything i would
hang them or shoot them like rats if i came across them after this-

    its a mean sort of thing to do for theres neither gain nor revenge in
it farrell added

   wilton looked at his ruined property without speaking it had been hard
enough to lose his bullock team as he had done but to have his dray wantonly
destroyed with its load and lose not only all his belongings but the money
he would have earned by delivering the goods in sydney was a bitter experi-
ence

   several of the other men had by this time ridden over and joined the
three when they saw what had been done they were loud in their protes-
tations of wrath against the destroyers and of sympathy for wilton

   wilton sat on his horse brooding over the disasters which had come upon
him since the unlucky evening when ignoring all suggestions of caution he
the track of midnight



had attempted to cross the flooded flat if only he had been content to camp
on the other side he might have escaped the notice of the blacks his bullocks
might still have been alive and he might have been miles on his journey to
sydney instead of which he had through what he now termed his folly
rushed into a perfect network of trouble and despair and after narrowly es-
caping with his life from friends and foes found himself with all his property
destroyed aud the result of his five years toiling thrown to the winds he
was looking towards the place where the track turned  to the flat and
where he had halted his team while he tried the ground to see whether it
would bear on that memorable evening when he saw what made him shout
to his comrades and gallop furiously away

   a horseman passed from the bush on to the opening of the track

    there he is  come on he shouted aud the band hearing his voice
and seeing him ride so madly away took up the cry and followed him

    farrell managed to get alongside of him

      who is it   he asked as they raced  together

   midnight wilton called back his mind now filled with one idea the
revenging of his misfortune

    as they reach ed the track they caught another glimpse of the man riding
rapidly away down the track in front of them and farrell called back to the
galloping crowd behind him that one of the gang was in front wilton urged
his horse to its topmost speed and drew away from his companions as he
gained upon the fugitive

    wilton felt his blood tingle as he saw how rapidly he was gaining on the
flying bushranger uutil scarce fifty yards lay between them he had the
pistol he had taken from the man the blacks had speared and he experienced
a grim satisfaction as he drew it from his belt so as to be ready for action
they were now riding along a straight stretch of the track and he was cal-
culating how far it would be before he overtook the man in front of him
when the latter suddenly wheeled his horse into the bush firing a shot at
wilton as he vanished among the trees

   wilton followed his lead and was crushing through the undergrowth
towards the man whom he could still see at intervals through the open bush
edging his horse nearer and nearer to him wilton was presently able to
make out the mans face when he again swerved in his course gaining some
yards in the suddenness of his manoeuver

    again and again he turned but he was unable to shake off his persistent
pursuer who was too intent upon the chase to notice that none of his com-
rades had followed him off the track he was only conscious of the fact that
he was after one of the men who had done him such uncalled for injury and
his fierce desire for revenge obliterated every other feeling from his heart

   suddenly he found himself again upon an open track with the fugitive
scarce ten yards ahead and he shouted out to him to surrender the bush-
ranger turned in his saddle and laughed back at him

   the rage that had been smoldering seemed to burst into an overwhelming
fury and urging his panting steed into one great final effort he reached the
side of the other and with his pistol leveled cried to him to surrender


the track of midnight

   the man laughed again as he swiftly raised his arm and flung his empty
pistol into wiltons face

   instinctively wilton pressed the trigger of his weapon so intent was he
upon the object of his revenge that he failed to make even the slight move-
ment which was necessary to avoid the blow the bushranger aimed at him
with the result that he was struck with such force as to be rendered un-
conscious but as his senses left him he saw his enemy fall forward upon
his horses neck and in the keen satisfaction that he felt at his triumph he
was oblivious to the stunning blow he had received and knew not that he
also fell from his saddle as the bushranger fell from his

   the horses freed from their burdens galloped down the track side by
side leaving the two men lying where they fell as they passed down the
track two other men rode out of the bush and seeing the riderless condition
of the horses turned and galloped in the direction wrhence they had come

   directly they caught sight of the two figures lying in the roadway they
gave vent to long shrill coo-ees the cry of the bush and hastened towards
the prostrate men

chapter viii-plovers revenge

   the bushranger struggled to get up as farrell and johnson approached
and managed to raise himself up on his arm but the effort was too much
and looking up at them with a pale anguished face he rolled over with a
groan

   hes badly hurt farrell exclaimed as he leaped off his horse and
stooped over him then he hastened to wilton just as he opened his eyes

   johnson who had also dismounted raised him into a sitting position and
farrell again turned his attention to the wounded outlaw who lay in a grad-
ually increasing pool of blood

    he wont last long im afraid he said

   wilton dazed and bewildered looked from one to the other a clattering
of approaching horses as the band closed in filled the air beside him he saw
the man lying bleeding and over him his two friends bent as they urged him
to get up the last memory he had was a feeling of intense joy at the sight
of his falling foe but now he shuddered as he looked at the form beside him
the sight of his ruined dray had maddened him but now the fit had passed
and he felt a bitter remorse as he looked upon the other wreck that he had
made

   as the other men rode up they glanced with concern towards wilton as
he sat propped up against farrell and johnson with his head turning from
side to side and his eyes vacant and lifeless

    now then my lad freshen up freshen up farrell exclaimed

   put him on his feet one of the men called out and he was lifted up
until he stood

    now youre all right youre not hurt badly farrell continued

 look at that wilton said as he pointed to the man lying in the track

    the best days work you ever did farrell answered
the track of midnight



   some of the men had gathered round the wounded bushranger and notic-
ing that he still breathed one of them called out

    theres time to hang him yet

   the suggestion was a little too brutal for the majority and a babel of pro-
tests arose

    remember doolan the man who had spoken cried fiercely

    the wounded man opened his eyes and in a weak voice said-

    doolan was one of us

   had a blight of dumbness fallen upon the band they could not have been
more silenced than they were at the remark of the dying outlaw wilton
who had been leaning against farrell started forward as he heard the sound
of the mans voice it was the voice he had heard when he crouched among
his woolbales saying that they would treat him as they had treated doolan

    i reckon thats news the outlaw said a wan smile flitting over his face
tell us more a man exclaimed starting forward but wilton was
before him facing the outlaw he said

     doolan was speared because he- heard you say that much before

when i was on the dray-

   the man looked at him and into his eyes there came a gleam of anger

     you were on the dray   he said with an oath

    yes the night you came with the blacks

    thats all right sonny the man went on with a grim smile  youre
marked you are doolan was marked too and what was done to him will
be done to you midnights not the man to forget who killed sam plover
 are you sam plover   farrell cried

    youd like to know wouldnt you   the man replied with another oath
 before it is too late answer me one question farrell went on excitedly
 as you hope for mercy in heaven show mercy to the parents whose hearts
you broke when you stole their child and say now is she alive or dead   
the man looked steadily at farrell for a moment

    what do you know about it  he said

    man do not trifle you are on the brink of eternity  in another min-
ute you may have gone right that one sin before you go they never did
you harm

   a spasm of pain contracted the dying mans face

    harm  she never did me harm  what am i now  what was i once 
go and ask her and ask her who changed me

    but the father he helped you and you told him-

    who are you that knows all about this the outlaw asked his eyes
gleaming horribly as they looked at farrell

    you have not forgotten what he saved you from once  farrell went
on speaking quietly

    who are you  the man asked again with less anger in his voice than
he had before

    you svtore then that when the time came-

    who are you   the man repeated his voice weaker and softer than it
had yet been


the track of midnight

    you would show you had not forgotten him farrell continued not
noticing the interruption

   with a final outburst of energy the dying man raised himself on his elbow

    and i have not forgotten him nor her he shouted as his eyes lit up
again with passionate hate i swore to remember them both and i have
he went on with a harsh mocking laugh  you want to know dont you
then ask midnight aud with a laugh that turned into a choked gurgle he
fell back-dead

    poor rascal wilton said sadly when they had examined him and
found that he was lifeless

   one of the cruelest scoundrels that ever walked the earth if he was
sam plover farrell exclaimed warmly  dont wraste pity on a heartless
villian like that

    whats the yarn about him farrell  one of the men asked

    ill tell you tonight round the fire and then youll say with me that
the shooting of sam plover is the best days work any man ever did yet
now well search him and see if we can get any clue as to the rest of the
gang

   to make sure that nothing escaped their notice they stripped the body of
all its clothes and examined every pocket and place where anything could be
hidden but all they could find which was of any service to them was a scrap
of paper containing the words  all speared but plover at cubby house

   there was a long discussion over the meaning of this message the first
half thanks to the information wilton had supplied was intelligible enough
but the last three words were meaningless and there was also the further
question as to whom the message was intended for

    its no use puzzling about that now johnson said at length its
enough to know that it will never reach the man and we are just as much
interested i dare say in knowing that all the gang were speared except
plover  

    and midnight some one put in

    yes im afraid after last night that midnight is all right johnson as-
sented

    in the meantime we had better bury this farrell said indicating the
body

   leave it where it is or burn it one of the men exclaimed  weve
had bother enough with him aud his mates without worrying over their
bodies

   farrell looked at johnson

    put a fire over it johnson said  and a few minutes later a huge fire
was blazing over the dead outlaw and the part taking his horse clothes
and arms rode away past the flat that had proved so eventful a spot for
wilton

   thej were well  the road to the creek that ran near the blown up cave
when a halt was called for the night when they had disposed of their even-
ing meal aud sat smoking round their camp fire some one called for farrell
to redeem his promise and tell them the yarn about plover
the track of midnight



     its a long story if you want everything he answered   but ill tell
it you as it was first told to me i learned a good deal about the details of
time and place later but i reckon the main facts will be enough to keep you
amused till its time to roll in the blankets

     the man came to the colony as a state official and the appointment he
held was one of the best to be had by the same ship another official also
voyaged accompanied by his daughter a handsome girl of seventeen on
the way out plover as we will call him-though that was not his real name
-became enamored with his colleagues daughter  but she does not seem to
have returned his affection and always treated him with more or less coldness
at the time they landed some twenty five years ago now there were only
about half a dozen men in the place with whom the girl could associate and
of course plover was one of those another was a young officer who had
also recently arrived in charge of a small contingent of troops this young
gentleman soon became a rival with plover for the young ladys hand and
heart and what was more he succeeded where the other had failed this
was said to have preyed a good deal on plovers mind and he became seriously
addicted to rum then about the only intoxicant that could be constantly ob-
tained in the place from drink he went to other evils and soon had about
as ill a name in the settlement as any one wtho wtas not a member of the chain
gang or an inmate of the refractory prisoners quarters long before he
reached that stage in his career the lady naturally turned her back upon
him and he was generally shunned by the remainder of the decent people in
the place-a proceeding which did not tend to make his mind easier or smooth
his difficulties away at last his conduct became so outrageous that it is said
the governor informed him that he was free to return to england whenever
he pleased by that time affairs had progressed so well between the two
lovers that their marriage was to be shortly celebrated by some means or
other-possibly because no one would associate with him-this piece of news
did not reach plover until after he had received the governors intimation
it appeared at the trial that he first heard it through his convict servant
while in a state of wild intoxication and in return for the news he flung
something at the head of his informant and killed him on the spot had he
stopped there he might have got away all right for a convict more or less
was very little worry to the authorities at the time but in his maddened
state nothing would serve him but that he must rush off in search of his rival
he found him at the house of his future bride and dashing into the room
which was full of the respectable portion of the community he made a furious
attack upon the young officer he had to be arrested then and when his
trial came on the murder of the convict was not included in the charge until
the newly arrived judge heard of it and being enthusiastic as most new
arrivals are insisted upon taking it into account stating that while he was
there justice should be administered to all with an even and impartial hand
plover was sentenced to twelve months imprisonment and when he came out
of jail he found that his rival had been married to the young girl for some
months to become a prisoner after having been a big official in a convict
settlement does not tend to make a man very obedient to prison rule and


the track of midnight

plovers record with the wardens at the end of the twelve months was as bad
as it could be

    directly he got out he went straight to the young officers quarters
and of course came face to face with his wife she screamed and fainted
and the convict servants rushing in had him secure in half a minute for they
had not forgotten their murdered mate nor the class of justice that had been
given to the ex-official and what would have been given to them had they
killed even one of themselves news was sent to the husband and by the
time he arrived on the scene i dare say the case for the prosecution was all
cut and dried among the convict witnesses plover was sent back to jail at
once and when he was brought up for trial the lady was too ill to appear as a
witness but the servants were there and they told so specious a tale and
bore one another out so fully even to the smallest detail that the judge said
it was absurd for plover to assert their evidence was all lies and that for his
part he had never heard such admirable witnesses they all got their tickets
of leave and plover five years and a flogging the latter part was com-
muted at the earnest solicitation of the young officer and plover was sent
away to help make the roads into the interior three years later there was a
revolt in the camp and plover with others escaped

    the young couple in sydney had in the meantime been blessed with a
little daughter who was their one great pride and joy a mouth after
plovers escape the child vanished she had been put to sleep in the after-
noon and was under the care of a nurse and no one had any idea of what had
occurred until the time came and went when it was customary for the nurse
to bring the little toddler down to meet her father on his return home for tea
fearing nothing of what was in store for them the young couple went up
arm in arm to the nursery on the floor the nurse lay stabbed through the
back and on the childs cot a sheet of paper on which was scrawled sam
the plovers square at last

     it was a terrible blow to them as it was for they did not at first know
who  sam the plover  might be  but when they learned that that was the
prison nickname of their one time friend the ex official their grief was more
than doubled

    from that moment to this nothing has been heard of the child the
parents are still living in sidney but are otherwise childless wealth has
come to them but neither has been the same since they discovered the loss
of their baby who if living would now be a girl of nearly twenty plover
seems to have kept clear of the police ever since his escape and it was gen-
erally believed that he must have perished in the bush so that if we may re-
gard his statement as the truth the man wilton shot is the man who has been
for fifteen years defying every law in the land  

chapter ix-a dangerous experiment

   wilton listened to the story with more than interest he had blamed
himself severely when he first saw the man lying as he thought dead  it
had seemed to him such a terrible thing to slay a man as a recompense for a
the track of midnight



broken dray but now that he heard of the worse than wasted life his victim
had lived and the misery and unhappiness he had brought to others his re-
morse vanished and in its place he felt a proud emulation at his own deed

     im not sorry i shot him he involuntarily exclaimed

      if the authorities will accept his word as evidence that he was plover
it was a good stroke for you there has been a reward out for years for him
or proof of his death farrell replied

    i wonder how you know so much about him farrells comrade said
 that is easy enough to explain farrell answered with a laugh  my
father was sergeant in the company that major pearson brought out the
major was only a lieutenant then and the old man a corporal and of course
he knew all the yarn about the rivalry between his officer and plover the
old mans one song to me ever since i joined the police is  find the majors
daughter and shoot that villian plover   

     and wilton has taken half the job out of your hands johnson said

     and ill be only too pleased if he takes the other half and disposes of it
in the same manner farrell replied 

   a few days later the band dispersed in the mean time johnson had gone
round his little circle suggesting that as wilton had been rather roughly
treated by them when he first met them they might make up enough among
themselves to enable him to buy a new team aud dray in sydney the pro-
posal had been readily acceded to and when the two troopers and wilton
had parted from the main body the latter had in his possession a variety of
orders on sydney agents totaling to a sufficient large sum to set his mind
at rest as to the re-equipment of his carrying requisites

   but there was yet another change in store for him upon his arrival in
sydney the shooting of plover was reported and all the other information
which he had been able to obtain as to the later doings of the gang the
news reached major pearson and he exerted himself to the utmost to obtain
the promised reward for wilton the result was that a laud order was given
to him and he discussed with farrell the best course to adopt

     ill tell you what i would do the honest trooper answered  i would
apply for meleelee run doolans dead and as far as we know there is 
one who can claim to be his heir if the government give it to you then
youll be in the district where midnight generally is and who knows but that
you will be able to finish my task and find the majors daughter 

    its a bargain on one condition wilton said you saved me from
being hanged and helped to find out who plover was if you agree to come
and share the place ill apply forit then we can track midnight together
it took some persuasion to make fairell agree but in the end he con-
sented and again with the majors influence behind him wilton was allowed
to use his grant in taking up the unoccupied run of meleelee

   instead of buying a team and a dray with the funds the squatters had
given him he devoted it to purchasing stock the major insisting upon con-
siderably augmenting the capital of the two young partners wilton started
off at once for the station farrell having to wait a month or so before he

could get away from the service and it was arranged that when he followed
    c


the track of midnight

he should bring with him two or three consigned servants and collect the
stock which wilton was to buy on his journey up

   after leaving sydney wilton traveled up to johnsons station and told
him of the change of fortune that had come to himself and farrell

     i shall be glad to welcome you as neighbors and we shall all feel satis-
fied to have you two handy the next time we have to turn out after our friend
midnight as giles has sworn never to go out with us again

    how is he  wilton asked

   well your heels have left a mark on him that will last as long as he
does and i am afraid he is rather bitter against you in consequence its a
pity because you are his next neighbor and he is a queer surly sort of man
when offended he must always have his own way to be happy i would
keep clear of him for a few mouths if i were you

    what about midnight  wiltoninquired

    nobody has heard or seen anything of him since he rode through our
camp that night johnson answered  the man is a perfect fiend for cun-
ning  

   as wilton sat under the shadow of his veranda smoking his solitary pipe
the words came back to his mind   and that is the man farrell and i are
going to best   he thought to himself   i wonder what will be his next
move   

   he rose from his seat and turning towards the door of the hut he caught
sight of a black fellow only a few yards away from him in the act of raising
his spear to throw

   startled at the sudden appearance of a man when he considered himself
absolutely alone and that man moreover an evidently hostile black fellow
wilton was for the moment unable to do more than stand still and stare
his surprise was increased when the black fellow instead of hurling his spear
staggered forward and fell

   the first impulse that came to wilton was to dash into the hut and seize
his rifle which he had learned always to have handy he wtas half way to the
door when a sudden wave of compassion seemed to pass over him and he
turned and went to the black fellow as he stooped over him he gave an ex-
clamation of horror for he saw that the unfortunate creatures back was so
hideously scored and cut that it looked as if it had been flayed there was
only one instrument which could have inflicted such brutal injuries and that
was the  cat with which unruly prisoners were beaten at the convict set-
tlements

   wilton stood over him wondering how and where the whipping had been
administered for the cuts were recent and were still bleeding he had not
got so far as to speculate by whom and why when the black groaned weakly

   poor wrretch what agony he has been suffering wilton thought
compassionately as he hastened to the hut from whence he brought such
crude remedies as he had and tried to dress the wounds the dressing was
hardly worth the name from a surgical point of view as cold water and an
old soft worn out shirt comprised the entire stock of the appliances wilton
possessed in the medical line but the application of the cool soft bandages
the track of midnight



eased the burning pain the black fellow suffered and just as he recovered
consciousness he turned his head and glanced up into wiltons face

    my word you good longa me he said in broken english

    what name you try kill me wilton asked in the peculiar jumbled up
language which the average white man and especially if he is english speak-
ing always uses towards those whom he fancies do not understand his
tongue

   baal me try it the black answered me think it doolan plenty
bad feller doolan my word all longa same midnight

    doolans been dead for months wilton said as he tied the last knot
to his bandage and the black fellow weakly rose to his feet

   he was a splendid specimen of the aboriginal race as it was before the
white mans rum and the yellow mans opium had spread the hideous havoc
mentally morally and physically that afterwards degraded it he was
nearly six feet in height with long clean lower limbs and a beautifully
modeled musclar chest as he stood up he reeled

    where you get hurt   wilton asked

   midnight my word debbil that feller plenty long time  food

   it flashed into wiltons mind that he now had the chance of learning
something of the notorious bushrangers whereabouts if he could only induce
the black to talk he had often heard of the treachery of the blacks and
how they were not to be trusted or believed but as he looked at the fine eyes
of the man before him he felt that here at all events was one who was not
so entirely bad at any rate he would try him  it might mean the discovery
of midnights hiding place and the risk was worth undertaking for a big
reward was offered by the government for the arrest of the notorious outlaw

    you want tucker you come along but with me wilton said

    the black looked at him curiously

    my word you good feller he said again and he stooped down for his
spears which lay on the ground beside him and placed them in wiltons
hand he took them and led the way into the hut then he gave the
black some bread and meat and sat watching him as he devoured it

   when he had finished all there was before him wilton began to question
him about midnight and himself and elicited some interesting information

   it appeared that the black was a member of the tribe that lived in some
broken ridges near the head of the river which flowed through part of
meleelee the antipathy of the squatters towards the blacks due very
largely to the scaring of cattle by the unfortunate people who could not be
made to understand that it was highly iniquitous to kill an occasional animal
that belonged to the men who had taken possession of their country and did
their utmost to destroy the game which was the chief means of livelihood to
the natives had led to an alliance such as it was between the tribe and the
bushrangers in the district chief of whom was the redoubtable midnight

   while the squatters under giles and johnson had been out against
one section of the outlaw community another expedition had been organized
by the settlers beyond the range against both the blacks and their allies
the result of that expedition had been equally disastrous for the enemy as


the track of midnight

that with which wilton had been associated aud the news of the reverse had
been communicated to midnight by the black warrigal

   he explained as well as he was able that communication with midnight
was always made at a hidden cave in a deep rocky gully which lay so far as
wilton could gather some miles behind his hut warrigal had arrived at
the cave and had waited for midnight

   the chief of the outlaws he said had come in a great rage and when he
heard of the defeat he knocked the messenger down and binding him hand
and foot flogged him with a green hide whip until he was exhausted and had
then left the cave and the unfortunate native bouud and bleeding

   after much difficulty he had managed to get loose from his bonds and
burning for revenge had hastened to meleelee where he knew one of the se-
cret members of the gang lived he had crept up behind wilton thinking
that he was doolan when he sat smoking he was just about to spear him
when wilton rose and faced him and the surprise at seeing a different face
from what the one he had expected prevented his carrying out his intention

    then ni word all got dark and me no savee he said by way of ex-
plaining the sudden collapse he had experienced

    where is midnight now   wilton asked

   the black shook his head

    will you show me where the cave is   wilton asked

    my word midnight kill me kill you warrigal explained excitedly

    no he wont wilton said  i shoot him

   warrigal laughed  no fear he said

    why not  wilton inquired

    him plenty safe you shoot him my word no good  him shoot you
you dead  

    but why   wilton persisted

    suppose you want kill him you shoot him there warrigal said point-
ing to his eyes  no good he exclaimed as he touched his head chest
and legs and shaking his head vigorously all the time

    where you learn english   wilton asked changing the subject with a
view of suddenly returning to the midnight question again and seeing
whether the black would vary his story

    plenty long time sidney warrigal answered

    who with   wilton inquired

   instead of replying the black turned quickly towards the door and ap-
peared to listen intently takingwilton by the arm he held up a warning
hand as if for silence and bent his head on one side then he pointed to the
doorway aud slipping to the back of the hut crouched down out of sight
behind a bag of flour and some other stores which wilton had placed there

   at the same moment wilton caught the sound of an approaching horse

chapter x-the result of the experiment

   as far back as mary giles could remember she had never known her
father to have such a prolonged fit or savage temper as he had after his un-
the track of midnight



expected return from the expedition he had led forth against the bushrangers
in order to avenge the murder of his nearest neighbor doolan of meleelee

   she could not remember a great many years back having barely seventeen
to call her own since she had come into the world  but that number was very
much too small to account for all the occasions when the temper of her father
had made her life a misery when johnson told wilton that giles was a
queer surly sort of man when offended he only expressed half the truth for
as his daughter knew only too well it was not alone when he was offended
that he exhibited those undesirable qualities

   the days went bj and still he maintained his morose savageness then
johnson had come on his way home from the expedition and he told mary
and her father of the successful termination of the campaign

   giles laughed immoderately at the story of midnights dash through the
camp

    why didn t you have guards out   he asked

     why indeed that is what we all asked one another when it was to
late johnson replied

   and wilton shot plover did he giles went on well next to
midnight he was the toughest of the gang and its  loss to the community
that he is gone

   a chance reference made by her father to the fact that a new proprietor
was coming to meleelee set mary wondering and puzzling in a way that was
entirety foreign to her and when he said that he was going to ride over and
see the newcomer she was keenly on the alert

   when wilton going to the door of his hut to see who it was that was
riding up and whose horses approach had been heard by the keen eared
warrigal long before the white man had discerned it he was more than as-
tonished to see giles he met him as he rode up to the door and noted the
ugly scar that disfigured his forehead

    so were neighbors  giles called out in a friendly tone  well we
met under different conditions before but i hope that wtont interfere with
our friendly relations it wont on my part i know

   nor on mine mr giles my hurting you was practically an accident
and your hurting me was about the same  

    thats so my lad and im glad to hear you saj it im glad youve
come up here especially now that youve shot plover the next best man
is midnight and i suppose youll be ready to have a go at him when ou get
the chance   

    i shall wilton answered frankly

   well good luck to you when you do  but mind youre not dealing
with a fool when you do come across him

   warned by johnson wilton had anticipated that his first meeting with
giles would be of a very different character from this friendly exchange of
views when his guest dismounted and sat on the seat he had occupied
when he discovered warrigal and chatted about the quality of the country
on meleelee and its value for stock raising he was more and more surprised

    well ill have to be going he said at length  ill be glad to see


the track of midnight

you at billali when you can ride over and theres only one bit of advice i can
give you-if you see any niggers about shoot them  sight they come
round sometimes and if you dont shoot them theyll spear you or your
cattle  so dont waste time over it

    after he had ridden away wilton went inside the hut to see what had be-
come of worrigal he walked over to the pile of stores and looked behind
it but no black fellow was there  he glanced round the place and peered into
every nook and cranny where the man could hide but all in vain he called
out his name first softly and then loudly but received no answer warrigal
had disappeared

   he came back to the doorway and stood musing the black had not
passed out through the door he was certain for either giles or himself must
have seen him the hut was a small structure and its interior formed only
one room the door and a small window being the only openings for light
ventilation or traffic that the builder had thought worth while making how
then had warrigal escaped 

    glancing round over his shoulder wilton looked at the fireplace and its
big wide chimney he had not thought of that before and crossing over the
floor he stooped and looked up the wide open space to the sky there was
ample room for a man to get up if he were as agile and nimble as a monkey
and wilton knew that a black had both qualifications to perfection

   he went outside the hut and searched for any signs there might be which
would confirm his suspicions there may have been plenty but wilton was
not skilled enough to read them and he returned to the doorway feeling baffled
and angry the spears that warrigal had placed in his hand had also vanished
and the words giles had said to him came again to his mind and he felt that
he had been in error in allowing his kindly sympathies to get the better of
him when he turned to get his rifle and shoot the black who had threatened
him

    but he was such a fine looking chap he mused  it would have
been downright murder to kill a man like that and in cold blood

   it never occurred to him to regard the blacks disappearance otherwise
than as a token of treachery the anxiety he expressed in all his movements
when he first heard the horse was ignored by the superior intelligence of the
white man who condemned merely because he could not understand the
readiness with which all his questions had been answered and the information
he wanted given to him by warrigal was also overlooked now that he had
come across a course of behavior which did not quite recommend itself to
him it was the usual result when white met black all that the white
man expected the black never did while he would do what no white man
would ever dream of doing nor could ever understand and the result was
a firm conviction of the innate treachery of the black and the necessitj as
giles had said to shoot on sight unless the white man wanted to be speared

    the same line of ideas occurred to wilton as he stood musing at his door
he had allowed the black to see that he was the only man about the place
and had also exposed the stores which were inside the hut it only required
a touch of nervousness to make wilton believe at once that the black had
the track of midnight



been an emissary from a tribe sent with their treacherous cunning to as-
certain whether an attack could safely be made upon the hut

   the soft sound of a distant coo-ee came to him through the still air of the
evening he turned to where his rifle was and taking it up examined the
primings carefully without stopping to consider that if the black had sought
to betray him he would have taken all the weapons he could find as well as
his spears when he made his escape wilton examined the pistol he had
taken from the bushranger and which he still possessed with it in his belt
aud his rifle in his hand he felt that he was better able to defend himself
and his mind grew calmer as he added his powder flask and a small bag of
bullets to his equipment

   the darkness was gradually overcoming the last gleam of the setting sun
and he noticed that there was a crescent moon which gave just enough light
to enable any one to make out the hut from the surrounding trees but which
rendered the shadows beyond impenetrable

   wilton had heard of the method the blacks adopted in attacking a hut
and his own experience in the dray on the flooded flat also warned him that
the worst place he could select as a shelter was his own roof the system
they worked on was very simple and very effective as they approached the
hut they were going to attack the blacks gathered long shreds of dry stringy
bark or other fiber and bound them in loose sheaves at the point of their
spears the huts being built entirely of wood with perhaps large sheets of
bark for the roofing were in the fine dry weather that obtained for the
greater part of the year little more than tinder boxes and only needed a few
sparks to set them ablaze

   when the blacks were foolish enough to attack the white men by day-
light their rude weapons had no chance against the death dealing rifles of
the invader and even at night the odds were in favor of the white mau under
ordinary circumstances so the blacks set about evolving a scheme by which
they could bring about an extraordinary series of circumstances perhaps
some of their allies among the outlawed whites helped them but it was not
long after settlement commenced before a new terror was added to the list of
drawbacks to locating in the interior

   usually when on the march the blacks carried a  fire stick which con-
sisted of a peculiar wood that smoldered in a hot red point blazing into flame
when fanned or gently blown upon the application of the three ideas the
fire stick the sheaves of inflammable fiber and the dry roof to one another
produced to the aboriginal a new and powerful weapon of attack creeping
up near a lonely hut at night when the men inside considered they were safe
at all events from surprise glowing cinders from the fire stick were dropped
into the sheaves of fiber and the spear hurled at the dry bark of the roof

   terrified by the sudden outburst of the conflagration the inmates rushed
from the burning hut under the impression that the bush was on fire the
light from the blazing roof showed them distinctly to their hidden enemies
and before they knew their danger a flight of spears was upon them and
they fell on the threshold of their home

   it was an admirable arrangement for the blacks and many a brave fellow


the track of midnight

lias been awakened from his sleep by the roar of fire over his head to rush to
the door in an effort to escape but only to rush into the death trap set for him
it did not take wilton very long to make up his mind what to do

chapter xi-midnight visits meleelee

   about a hundred yards from the door of the hut there was the remains
of a big fallen tree it had evidentljr come down in some by gone bush fire
for its outer side was charred and burnt and the little that remained standing
above the roots was also burnt and black but its fall had been of marvelous
benefit to a subsequent growth and the space it had cleared when it fell was
now crowded by a growth of young saplings and bushes

   directly it was dark enough for his movements not to be observed by any
one who might be watching wilton crept round under the shadow of the
veranda into the bush behind the hut thence he cautiously made his way
to the clump of saplings and lying down close under the fallen log rested
his rifle upon it and watched the door of the hut

    silently the hours passed and he lay still listening intently for any sound
that might signify the approach of his enemies but the night wore on
slowly and his ears caught nothing more than the ordinary noises dim and
indistinct of the sleeping bush the moon was waning and its weak slant-
ing beams illuminated the open spaces enough to make the shadows beyond
absolutely impenetrable

   with his senses keenly  the alert wilton was convinced in his own
mind that an attack was to be made upon him  and as the time passed the
suspense and uncertainty began to tell upon him and he wished he had
ridden away after giles directly he discovered that warrigal had gone
then he wished that he had waited until farrell could have come up with
him for as he lay in the silence and half light the story of how the previous
owner of meleelee had met his end forced itself upon his already strained
nerves

   the crackle of breaking twigs sounded through the air and instantly he
tightened his grip upon his rifle a moment later and he saw a dark figure
stealthily creeping toward the door of the hut from the shadow of the bush

   wilton felt his nerves in a tremor as he watched the man crouched down
and moving with a wonderfully silent stealthiness towards the hut the
faint glimmer of the fading moonlight was just sufficient to show him up as a
dark shadow but was not enough to enable wilton to see whether he was
black or white clad or naked the way in which he moved suggested the
black and presently noticing an indistinct something which looked very like
a spear trailing behind the figure wilton made up his mind that it was either
warrigal or another member of his tribe

   the parting advice of giles flashed through his memory and he glanced
along the sight of his rifle as well as he could so as to get a steady aim at the
man his finger was on the trigger and he was about to pull it when dis-
cretion came to him and he hesitated supposing that the man were only
one member of the tribe who was creeping upon the hut in order to ascertain
the track of midnight



whether the inmate was prepared for the altack  to fire upon him as he
crept up would be to alarm the remainder while the flash of the rifle shot
would at once locate the place where wilton was hiding

    on the other hand if he were alone there would be plenty of time and a
better opportunity when he emerged from the hut as he was sure to do di-
rectly he discovered that wilton was not within discretion was certainly
the better part of valor if either of these ideas were correct and with his
finger still on the trigger wilton moved his rifle slowly round so as to cover
the advancing figure and be ready to fire at any moment

    he saw him reach the shadow of the veranda and stand up and as he did
so wilton noticed that he was clothed it was sufficient to tell him that the
man was white and an ugly suspicion crossed his mind warrigal had
spoken of midnight as being in the neighborhood but what if he had been
merely a spy sent forward by midnight to learn how many men there were in
the hut what if the man who was now at the door of the hut were mid-
- night himself wilton felt his heart leap at the thought he could cover
him directly he came from the hut and fire when he was sure of his aim
and then with the great outlaw dead or wounded he could claim from his
neighboring squatters a recognition better even than that which he had
already received

    he lay scarcely breathing as he heard the hut door pushed gently open
then an unbroken silence reigned and he knew that the man whoever he
was was creeping towards the stretcher where under ordinary circumstances
he himself would be lying asleep a shudder passed over him as he thought
of his fate had he been in the hut for he had little doubt now but that the
man was bent upon assassination and what resistance could he have offered
had he been suddenly awakened to find an armed man standing over him
perhaps with the muzzle of a rifle pressed against his forehead or the point
of a dagger at his throat

    then came the sound of rapid footsteps from the interior of the hut and
gripping his rifle tightly wilton watched for the man to reappear the hut
door grated as it was flung back and just as the last of the moonlight flickered
the ground the man stepped from under the veranda and glanced round

    wilton felt his heart stop and then beat and throb in the excitement of
the moment for there barely fifty yards away stood the unmistakable figure
of midnight

    with his rifle aimed point blank at the broad chest of the outlaw he
pulled the trigger the report of the shot sounded so loud to his overstrained
nerves that he sprang up as he heard it and so was able to see over the smoke
that hung along the ground able to see the bushranger stagger back and
hear the hoarse exclamation which broke from his lips

    wilton shouted in the ecstasy of victory as he leaped forward pistol in
hand to challenge the man to surrender or die but he had forgotten who
his opponent was

    as he came out of the shade of his protecting bushes he saw midnight
raise his rifle in the recklessness of the excitement which was upon him
wilton aimed his pistol and pulled the trigger there was a little flash and


the track of midnight

a puff of smoke and a mocking laugli came from midnight the pistol had
missed fire

    with his rifle empty and his pistol useless wilton was at the mercy of
the man whom common report said was merciless the desperate position he
was in came to him more quickly than he could have thought and he turned
and sprang into the shelter of the bushes he heard the report of the bush-
rangers rifle  something whizzed past his ear burning it as if a piece of hot
iron had touched it a horrible sense of fear swept over him and wilton fled
for his life

   neither heeding nor thinking where he was going he rushed madly for-
ward crashing through the undergrowth tripping and stumbling over fallen
logs and projecting roots until suddenly the trees ceased and before and
around him he realized that there was open space the fear of the man
whom he believed was only a few paces behind him gave him the energy of
despair and he rushed onwards blindly and wildly

   the ground went from undfer his feet  there was a mighty rush of air
aud he knew that he was falling it was only a few seconds of time  but it
was as a lifetime to him as he looked upwards and backwards and saw a long
thin tongue of flame shoot out from the blackness of the bush that he had
left and the report of a rifle shot echoed through the night then he struck
water with a splash and sank into the cold flood

    fortunateljr he was an able swimmer and as soon as he felt himself in the
water his senses returned to him he struck out and slowly rose to the
surface his wits about him and the terror that had urged him to his head-
long flight gone as his head came above the water he glanced quickly
round ready to dive should he see anything of his enemy he comprehended
then where he was he had plunged into the river from the top of a high
bluff and the stream had already carried him far enough away for him to be
able to look back to where the bluff stood out black against the dim light
from behind it there showted a faint gleam which even as he watched in-
creased until a blaze of light showed through the night

    midnight had set fire to his hut

   full of bitterness and anger wilton swam to the shore and was making
his way back through the bush towards his burning hut before he quite
grasped the folly of his actiou his empty rifle he had left on the log when
he sprang up to complete his conquest of the redoubtable midnight  his
pistol he had dropped in his rapid flight and he was now empty handed and
unarmed and yet was going back to face a man who was not only armed
but so cool and collected that he could use his weapons even in the face of
such dangers as had recently threatened him

   wilton paused in his hurried walk if he wanted to effect anything he
would have to act cautiously and thoughtfully he stood for a while de-
bating with himself the best course to adopt and then walking silently and
carefully he crept towards the blaze which showed through the trees

   when he had approached near enough to see the flaming structure which
was all that was left of his hut he stopped for between him and the fire he
saw midnight standing and watching the burning mass he had his back to
the track of midnight



wilton who closely studied the broad shouldered figure bitterly regretting
the fact that he was without arms and therefore unable to take advantage of
the more than favorable opportunity to rid the world of one against whom he
now had double reason to bear malice

   the outlaw stood with his arms resting on his rifle and wilton as he
lookod noticed that the mans shoulders were very much out of proportion to
his height the long black hair escaped from under his hat and fell around
his head in a heavy fringe as he watched there recurred to his mind the
words of warrigal when he said that to shoot midnight one would have to
aim at the eyes with the thought there came another suggested by the
clumsy appearance of the mans body midnight moved at the same mo-
ment and the thought was confirmed the man had some protecting armour
under his coat

    ill keep the idea to myself wilton thought fearing that he would be
ridiculed if he mentioned it to any one    but the next chance i have at him
ill aim at his eyes

   midnight watched the fire until the hut was only a mass of glowing em-
bers and then turned and walked away through the bush with his rifle over
his shoulder towards the direction in which warrigal had pointed when he
located the bushrangers lair

   wilton waited until he could no longer hear him before he crept round to
the log where he had hidden his rifle still lay where he had left it and
after a search he also found his pistol loading them with the ammunition
he had he gave a last glance at the ruin of his hut and started off for billali
to appeal to giles to rouse the countryside and hunt the outlaw from his
hiding place

chapter xii-wilton reports progress

   it was a long and weary walk through the dark bush and the sun just
rising above the horizon when wilton caught sight of billah homestead he
pressed on to the house and was stepping on the veranda when giles appeared
at the doorway

   hullo my lad what brings you over at this hour and whats the
rifle for  he exclaimed

    ive been stuck up and my hut burned by that villain midnight
wilton replied

    stuck up you dont say that  midnight stuck you up and you es-
caped with your life    giles cried

    it was a near thing i can assure you i went over the bluff into the
stream and that saved me i think wilton answered as he sat down

   youre wounded giles said excitedly pointing to the blood which had
flowed from the cut midnights bullet had made on his ear

   its only a scratch wilton replied im more tired than hurt at
present for i had to tramp it over here

    and here i am not even asking you inside come in my lad and
welcome your news knocked everything else out of my head


the track of midnight

   he led the way into the house and wilton followed him inside the door
and then stood still as he caught sight of mary who had just entered the
room from the other side

     you did not expect to see any petticoats in this part of the world ill
be bouud giles said with a laugh as he saw the surprise depicted on
wiltons face  this is my daughter mary he went   mary this is
our new neighbor mr wilton-the man who shot the bushranger-and hell
have breakfast

   mary taken aback at the sudden appearance of a stranger was even more
surprised at the good humor her father was iu as the night before when he
came in after having been over to meleelee he was surly and morose she
glanced from him to wilton who still stood looking at her as though he had
never seen a woman before but his eyes were kindly and his face open and
manly and she did not shrink from his look as he did from those of the ma-
jority of the men who came to see her father

     how do you do  she said simply as she came over to him and held
out her hand an action which surprised her when she thought over it subse-
quently for even such minor courtesies were not current in the bush during
the earlier pioneer days when the rough and tumble of everyday life was far
too serious a business to leave either time or energy for useless and artificial
forms of salutation

      were you ever in sydney    wilton asked

     oh you are wounded   she exclaimed as she saw the red stain on his
shoulder  you have been hurt  

     it is nothing he said and was about to repeat his previous questions
when giles interrupted him

     midnight had a shot at him and spoiled his reputation by a miss he
said with a loud laugh  you can bet hell be nearer the mark next time
 oh father   said mary turning towards him

   go and hurry breakfast along he said im hungry-and so is
wilton after his little entertainment ill be bound

   then when she had left the room giles asked a dozen questions about
the experience wilton had undergone

    how was it you managed to get out he asked  did midnight open
the door for you   

   i wasnt inside when he came up i was fearing an attack from the
blacks and foolishly put off doing what i should have done until it was too
late indeed it did not occur to me until it was too late

    what giles asked

   i ought to have ridden over here wilton answered or told you
when you were over

    it may be all right but im hanged if i can make out what you are
talking about   giles exclaimed

     the blacks wilton said

     blacks  what blacks    theres no blacks round this part  we
cleared them out long enough ago except a few who loaf about the stations
but they would not hurt you
the track of midnight



    did you ever hear of one called warrigal   wilton asked

   giles who was sitting down sprang to his feet with a sharp exclamation
while his eyes gleamed in a sudden outburst of rage and an ugly frown
puckered his brows

    warrigal   he cried  where did you see warrigal  

    he was in the hut when you came yesterday  

   an imprecation came from giles lips

    he had escaped from midnight wilton continued

   escaped great heavens man do you know that he is midnights
right hand man and that when hes killed a score of men will be avenged
in your hut and you did not shoot him if i had only known i would
soon have settled him hes done more harm than all his tribe and you
let him off  its a marvel that oure alive to tell of it

    i pitied the poor wretch wilton said  he told me where midnights
hiding place is to be found

   giles laughed shortly  then take my advice and forget all about it
for it will either be a lie or a trap wait till you meet the black demon again
and then shoot him it will be the best way of letting him know that you
did not believe his yarn

    well i should have been killed in my bed last night if it had not been
for him wilton answered

    why  did he tell you that his chief was coming to see you  

no he vanished while we were talking and i suspected treachery
so lay in hiding waiting for the attack which i expected would come while
i was watching i saw a man creep up to the hut i let him get inside al-
though i had my rifle covering him all the time when he came out i fired
 and missed  giles exclaimed

     i suppose i did as he didnt drop wilton said

      what then    giles asked quickly

     i tried my pistol but it missed fire

      and didnt midnight pot at you in return   

    yes but i ran for it the bullet grazed my ear and i bolted as hard as
i could so hard that i ran right over the bluff he fired at me as i was
falling but in the dark he missed me and when i came to the surface again i
saw the glare of the fire he had made in the hut then i crept back and
and watched him as he stood looking at my hut burn when he had gone i
searched for my rifle and pistol which i had dropped in my excitement and
after i had found them came on here to give the alarm

   giles looked at him fixedly for some moments without speaking then
he came over and took him by the hand

    youre a cool chap he said looking at him with his keen gray eyes
 youre a man after my own heart and if midnight is ever shot-for im
sure hell never be taken alive-i hope you do the shooting

    i mean to wilton said  ive a double score to settle with him
now  

    have a care my lad midnight is not a baby to play with giles said
seriously  hed think  more of shooting you-


the track of midnight

    than i would of shooting him wilton interrupted iu an angry tone
    you mean business giles remarked quietly

    i do wilton answered

    but how are you going to carry it through  

      get the squatters out again and hunt him to his lair  

    you cant do it weve tried that till were full of it a chance meet-
ing is what youll have to trust to

     im going to try it and if i cannot get any one else to join me ill wait
till farrell comes up with the stock and well go together

    youll do better to go slow for a time he probably believes he settled
you when youwent over the bluff and may be miles away by this time on his
road to some other of his haunts for he is not a man who stays long in one
place you lie low until you hear of him again and then turn out i fancy
the boys have had enough of the last trip to last them for a time  

    but did they ever know where to look for him  wilton asked

    hes been looked for everywhere not only round here but on the table-
land and over the ranges hes dodged the police and the squatters and
every one else for years and i tell you plainly you are taking on a big con-
tract when you undertake and hope to track midnight  

      but has no one ever found his hiding place   

    no and no one ever will even if they did they would never live to
tell of it for i can assure you it is not an easy matter to get at a man like
that without his knowing it

    i suppose he has spies all over the place to warn him wilton said

    i dont know about that giles answered thoughtfully but i do
know that as soon as an expedition is organized he vanishes and directly the
expedition disperses he turns up under the very noses of the men who were
out chasing him  

 hes a plucky chap wilton exclaimed  however bad he may be i
cant help admiring his pluck warrigal said that another branch of his
gang had been dispersed beyond the ranges besides the lot we smashed up
and yet he turns out again as bold as ever and sets to work single handed
 so you admire him  giles said with a short laugh

    i admire his pluck his going for me suggests that he has heard of
my shooting his mate and if that doesnt mean spies i dont know

    it looks like it certainly  but how do you hope to get at his hiding
place if there are spies about   

    i havent mentioned it to any one but you and i hardly fancy youre
likely to give him warning   wilton answered laughingly

    well hardly giles said  they made me a j p because i used to
get the fellows out after him so often and it would be playing it a bit low
down forme to give him the tip wouldnt it he added joining in the
laugh  besides which he stole the best horse i ever had and has paid me
many a compliment by driving off my cattle  

    in return for your interest in him i suppose wilton said

    but now that he has taken you up i hope hell leave me alone giles
remarked
the track of midnight



    youll join if theres another turn out after him  wilton asked

   im tired of it giles answered  go over to johnson and see what
he says though i doubt whether he will encourage you the mustering will
be on soon and the boys dont want to be flying over the country when
theyve enough to do minding their own business besides its time the po-
lice did something we cleared the blacks out ourselves and weve done
most of the hunting after the bushrangers and escaped convicts its all very
well now and again but i fancy were all pretty tired of it now

     the last one was fairly successful

   yes iu a way but it nearlj did for you giles said with a laugh
 it marked me a bit too and im not anxious for any more like it just yet
 the next one may finish the matter wilton said

      for me or for you   

   for midnight

     yes it may  but the near shave you had last time may be nearer
youve got off twice my lad and its bad to risk a third chance

    im inclined to all the same wilton replied

chapter xiii-mary awakens

   whether it was due to the excitement he had experienced the previous
night or the long tramp through the bush from meleelee to billah wilton
was not sure but he had a marvelous appetite when breakfast was served
and his spirits were at their highest as he sat opposite mary and chatted as
blithely as though there were no such things as bushrangers and burned huts
in the land

   she was unused to the society of any one who could talk about anything
beyond stock and the chances of drought or flood with the one exception of
johnson and during the meal she frequently found herself comparing the
new owner of meleelee with her friend but great as her opinion of johnson
was the comparison between him and wilton was generally in favor of the
latter for not only did his conversation please and entertain her but it also
pleased her father so much that she heard him laugh so heartily that the dim
far off memory of bygone happy days came to her clearer and stronger if
only she could make him laugh like that she thought as she glanced at him
how much brighter the days would be than they were

   wilton was telling them of his experience in the dray when he was stuck
up by the flood  the flat and giles was bantering him good humoredly
about his taking no notice of the warnings that had been given him by older
and more experience carriers

   just as you refuse to listen to me now about midnight he said

    well theres a reason for my wish to settle him wilton said gravely

   what another are not the two enough that you have given-your
burnt dray and burut hut   

    were you ever in sydney  wilton asked looking over at mary

    she has never been away from billah giles answered for her  but
whats this new reason  


the track of midnight

     your daughter reminded me of it wilton said thoughtfully  but if
she has never been away from here-

     oh i have mary said  i can just remember long ago before we
came here

     what do you remember   giles asked curtly

   mary looked away through the window without apparently heeding the
tone of her fathers voice

     it is clearer today than i ever remember it she said softly as though
she were speaking more to herself than to her companions  that time so
long ago before we came here there were a lot of houses big ones and
little ones and a lot of water

   you dont say you remember all that giles asked and wilton
glanced at him as he heard his voice plis face depicted the surprise that the
tone expressed

   wait a moment theres some more mary continued i seem to
be just-i dont quite know how to put it she said as she pressed her hand
to her forehead and her eyes grew moist

     it was when she was a child when her mother died giles said to
wilton i did not know she remembered it i hoped she had forgotten
it do you remember how you fretted mary 

     i remember crying for a long time she answered softly

     well if you remember so much i will help you for i dare say you are
old enough now to look at it sensibly giles remarked  you see wilton
it was a hard blow to me i was ruined and my wife died at the same time
and then i found myself with mary here who was a little girl of a year or
so just toddling and all my work to be done over again it was a case of
seeking fresh land out further back and i had to travel and carry the little
one with me till we found this patch and i obtained the grant she cried
her eyes nearly out for her mother and then used to cry whenever she
wasnt asleep to go back it was a hard time for me and i dont like talk-
ing about it he added with a heavy sigh

    mary was sitting silent and abstracted the brief story that her father
told threw a flood of light upon her memory for she could understand the
reason now of his moody temper she had unconsciously made his lot the
harder at the most painful period of his existence and it was not to be won-
dered at that he at a later periodshould have been estranged from her
here was the secret that she had often tried to fathom for herself the secret
why her father had ceased to be the happy contented man she just managed
to recall and why ho had become so morose and dissatisfied she was not
schooled in matters of the affections  she had grown to womanhood with no
other guide or comprnion than old narli  but the heart of a sympathetic
woman had developed upon its own lines and now wakened to the first touch
that it had ever felt she rose from her seat and going over to her father
she threw her arms round his neck and she said brokenly 

    oh why did von not tell me before i never knew and i have won-
dered so much  

    wilton watching the two saw giles eyes light up and into his heart
the track of midnight



there came a great longing something that he had never felt before and
something that seemed to change and alter him in the passing of a second
the recollection of his burned hut his wish to hunt midnight down his
anxiety to build up wealth all faded before this new impulse which swept over
him and carried mary giles up to the very pinnacle of his being and set her
there as his idol and his love

   he saw giles loosen his daughters arms and gently push her away but
he did not catch the words he uttered and which brought a rich mantling
flood of color to marys face

    come let us have a smoke and a yarn giles said abruptly as he rose
from the table and walked out on the veranda

   wilton saw marys eyes looking after him while her lip trembled and as
he passed her he looked into her face and held out his hand he intended to
say something but as she took it his mind forgot what it would have expressed
and he turned away confused and distressed and followed giles out

   so he did not see the light that came into her eyes and the smile that rip-
pled over her face before she turned and went to her own room she sat
upon her roughly constructed bed smiling happy and joyful for although
her father had repelled her when she attempted to show him the affection she
felt for him another had come into her life and in her unsophisticated man-
ner she did not for a moment trifle with the state of her feelings

   thus at the same time the two had installed-each other as the sovereign
of the heart and only a little more was needed of that sympathy which had
arisen for their eyes to be opened and those words to be said which would
link their two lives into one untrammeled by the rules of conventional
society there was no wish on either side to conceal and only the opportunity
was wanting when as naturally as flowers turn to the sun he would turn to
her and she to him and in the union of their loves the big battle of life be
begun

   as wilton joined his host on the veranda all desire to discuss the situation
had vanished before the new interest which had come into his life he sat
down and let his mind go into a dreamy reverie from which he was rudely
awakened by giles asking if he were not going to smoke

   mechanically he took his pipe from his pocket and began cutting up his
tobacco

    now whats your next move   giles asked  i suppose youll put up
a new hut for midnight to burn down again 

    i hardly know yet wilton replied

   its the best thing you can do and i dare say if you pass the word
round youll have all the help you want for my part i have to get away
over the ranges to see after some cattle that are offered to me and i was
going to start this morning  but i can delay that for a bit  

   and leave your daughter all alone here while midnight is about
wilton exclaimed

    oh shes all right hes too busy with his gang to bother about her
and besides i shall bring back some one who will take her off my hands

   wilton looked at him in surprise there was a ring of callous indiffer-

 d


the track of midnight

ence in his voice that jarred on the man who was just beginning to realize
that mary giles was worth very much more consideration than her father
showed her

     its an awful drag to have women about you in the bush giles went
on   it will be a relief to me to have her settled somewhere  

    wilton was about to say that perhaps there were some people who would
be only too ready to undertake the responsibility but before he could do so
giles continued 

     however that has nothing to do with the situation if i have to go
johnson is not far off and hell be better able to set you up with tools and
all the rest of it than i shall  

     i fancy i will wait until farrell gets up before i start a new hut a
tent will do for me in the mean time

      then johuson is the man to see for he has one or two but miue went
into holes a year back and i never replaced it yet  

    the constant suggestion that johnson was the best man to refer to gave
wilton a suspicion that giles was not too anxious for him to stay longer at
billah than was absolutely necessary

     ill ride over-but i forgot my saddle aud bridle were inside the hut
and were burned aloug with the rest of my things ill have to borrow a
bridle from you so that i can catch my horse

     that will be all right i can let you have a mount but you need not
be starting at once youll want a rest after last night have a camp for a
few hours

     i dont feel it jtet but i reckon ill have a spell in the afternoon i can
get to johnsons by that time if i start soon wilton said

     whats the hurry   giles asked  theres a lot to yarn about before
you go

     i want to get the news round as soon as i can wilton said

     what  still bent on shooting that poor wtretch   

   theres another reason why we should be out after him if you are
going to leave billah unprotected during your absence wilton replied

  we can at all events make the place too hot for him round about here and
then miss giles need not be afraid  

    giles laughed   she can take care of herself never you fear i believe
shed give a warmer reception to midnight than you would  shes no end
of a shot with a rifle  

     but its very risky wilton continued  if lies kept on the move he
would not be so likely to flourish as he does

     well my lad as i tell you i cant join in with you because i have to
be over the ranges for two very important matters one the buying of stock
and the other the bringing liojne of a mate for mary  

     she is going to be married   wilton exclaimed

   and why not surely shes old enough  and i shall not be sorry to
get the place free of petticoats  theyre more than a nuisance in the bush

     is it to a squatter  wilton asked

     well i reckon so there was one after her but she scared him off and
the track of midnight



he went home without her still there are yet plucky young chaps beyond
the ranges and i count on bringing one back all right  

    but she may not- wilton began

   giles looked at him quizzically

    may not   he said  well i manage things here and if she does not
choose to follow her fathers advice in such a matter as this shell have to
put up with what follows

   you mean that she would have-

    i mean that id not be bothered any more with her up here

   wilton sat smoking in silence for some minutes while he thought rapidly
and clearly it was very evident that the father had little real affection for
the girl and that his chief desire now was to get her as he put it off his
hands it was impossible to conjecture what sort of a man he might be who
was to be brought from over the ranges but whoever he was wilton felt
with all the jealous apprehension of a lover that he would be particularly
repugnant to mary it was quite sufficient in his state of mind to deter-
mine him and he said quickly 

    there are men this side of the range as well as the other

   giles eyed him critically before he answered

    what of that

    one of them might be prepared to take your daughter-

   meaning yourself giles interrupted leaning forward and looking
into wiltons face

   why not he replied evasively not caring for the keen suspicious
scrutiny of the others eyes

   well my lad because theres next door to no stock on meleelee and
what there is belongs to two men  because youre a marked man with the
gang and will never be safe till theyre all wiped out and otherwise because
you might leave a widow any day and lump the burden on to me again
and if you want any more reasons because ive passed my word to two
smart young chaps over there that they have first say one of them came
and went and now the other has a run for it after that supposing he
shies too like his mate did there may be a chance for meleelee but its a
poor one at any time  

chapter xiv-the track passes bill ah

   as if to prevent any further discussion of the matter giles inquired when
farrell was expected to reach meleelee wilton feeling irritated at the man-
ner in which the other had received his approaches with regard mar
answered shortly

     what route will he take    giles asked ignoring the bruskness of the
others reply

     that is more than i know except that he will have to come round by
diinsdales down the river for theres some stock there for him to pick up

    when was he to leave sydney   giles asked

    about a week since wilton answered
	the track of midnight

    then by three weeks he will be here so you wont have much time for
your expedition if you are going to meet him when he arrives giles
remarked and wilton thinking very much about other matters did not reply
he was debating with himself whether mary would receive his overtures in
the same off hand manner as her father had done and had just begun to urge
the advisability of trying with mary herself when giles interrupted his
thoughts

   youll be asleep in a minute he exclaimed with a laugh go and
have a rest and ill have the horses in by the time you are awake

   it was a pointed hint but wilton preferred not to accept it in view of his
latest idea and contented himself by saying that he would have a brief spell
before starting giles showed him a stretcher and he lay down upon it but
not to sleep his mind was far too actively engaged in scheming how he
could carry out his newly formed intention of winning mary even in spite of
her fathers objections

   he wished that farrell were near so that he could discuss the matter with
him and in deploring the fact that he was not at hand wilton remembered
johnson

   giles was very anxious for me to consult him on every other subject
and ill take his advice and see what he has to say about this wilton
thought

   the decision he had come to made him more impatient than ever to be
away and rising from the stretcher he went on to the veranda again
there he found mary who smiled as she saw him

     father said you were worn out after last night and were sleeping   she
said	 

   had he found giles on the veranda it is probable that he would have
been on his way to johnsons a few minutes later but the appearance of
mary upset all his ideas and instead of going he now wanted to stay

   your father-he has- he began lamely

    he has gone away to bring in a horse for you he said and will not be
back for an hour or so are you going away at once   she said

    yes he answered  that is soon i want-i have to-

   he felt as awkward and as speechless as a log as he stood looking at her
and watched the smile that played over her face

    get help for building the hut yes i heard you and father talking
she said

   heard him and giles talking  if he had been confused before he was
ten times worse now as he recalled his words about her and which she must
have heard if she had listened

   you heard us he exclaimed

    yes about your going to johnson im glad yoa know him hes my
best friend i think the girl said wistfully

   not your best wilton said with a twinge of jealousy in his heart

    well next to father i suppose she answered  ive known him so
long and hes so nice not a bit like-  and she hesitated

    like me wilton exclaimed
the track of midnight



    oh no not you the girl said quickly as she looked him in the face
with a light in her eyes that sent wiltons blood surging through his veins

 i meant like some others who come here

    from over the ranges wilton said rapidly

     oh they are horrible   she replied with a shudder

    then you-but you are going to- 

      i am going to what    she asked archly

    why your father said-didnt you hear him  

      i only heard you talking about johnson  

    and dont you like the men over the ranges 

    i hate them   she exclaimed warmly  father brought one here and
told me to marry him and i tried to get over to mr johnson and ask him to
stop it but the squatters turned out after midnight when he had killed
doolau and i havent heard of him since

   it was dangerous ground for wilton to encroach upon but he did not
stop to consider

   if your father brings another will you go to johnson again   he asked
looking at her with eyes that would have told her plainly what was in his
mind had she glanced at them but she was looking away into the bush and
wondering whether it was a man she had seen pass behind a tree or only her
fancy she heard wiltous words and answered without a moments hesi-
tation what was her intention

    no she said  i should come to you first

   then she looked at him and her eyes dropped before his

    for ever  he asked hoarsely his features working with the emotion
that broke from his control at her words

   she stood silent her color coming and going and her frame trembling in
a way she could not understand on her lips the words hovered to answer
him in the affirmative but behind them there was something that held her
back she felt that she would like to throw her arms around him as she
had done with her father earlier in the day with the knowledge that she
would not be repulsed  but again something held her back she glanced
swiftly up into the strong open manly face with a look of mingled love and
fear his eyes gleaming in their passionate fervor met hers he seized her 
two hands and holding them in a close grip exclaimed

    you will come to me for ever 

    you will have to take me she answered with a smile  narli says
it is always done  and you can be my champion then  

      i can and i will   he said warmly

   he drew her towards him but she started back and he nearly losing his
balance for the moment staggered forward as he did so his ears caught
the sound of the report of a rifle and a bullet struck a post of the veranda
beside which he had been standing and tearing off a splinter buried itself in
the wall of the house the splinter flew sideways and struck mary on the
head with sufficient force to stun her he caught her in his arms as she fell
and quickly looking over his shoulder saw the puff of smoke hanging over
some low bushes


the track of midnight

    he carried mary into the room where he had rested and placing her on
the stretcher called aloud for narli then he hastened to where he had left
his rifle and seizing it crept back to the door and peered cautiously out
there was a tremor in the bushes where he had seen the smoke and aiming
quickly he fired he saw a piece of the bush fall and then another shot
echoed from the same direction and the bullet plowed into the doorway
scarcely six inches from his head

    with a muttered imprecation at his own folly in not having fired his
pistol first and reserved his rifle shot for the opportunity which he now had
of locating the exact position of his enemy he retreated behind the door
while he reloaded his weapon in his excitement he had not noticed that
there had been no reply from narli and the sudden appearance of mary
behind him startled him

     what is it   she exclaimed

    theyre attacking us   he cried  i warned your father but he only
laughed at me

     but my head-what is it  she repeated

    a bullet struck the veranda and a fling splinter struck your head
dont show yourself   he cried as she made as if to go through the door-
way   look there   he added pointing to the mark the bullet had left on
the door

     oh you will be hurt   she exclaimed clutching at his arm

    he looked into her face and the anger faded from his eyes

     am i not your champion  he said

     but give me a rifle too i can shoot

     no no you go into safety and let me do the shooting your father
will hear it and return there is only one man over there  he added as he
rammed his charge home and examined the priming

    then he knelt down and peered round the edge of the door

   dont do that mary cried as she caught him dy the shoulder
 they will shoot you  

      i must defend you   he exclaimed

     but if they rush the house all the doors are open she cried  come
inside quick  

     there is only one i am sure and he dare not show himself he an-
swered loath to shake off the hold she kept on his shoulder

     but there may be more yes listen  i can hear horses

    he leaned forward and his ears caught the sound

   theyre coming theyre coming mary cried clinging to him in
her alarm  oh save me from them save me  

     they shall never touch you while i live   he exclaimed forgetting for
the moment the danger he was in as he pressed her to him and kissed her
up turned face

   she gazed into her eyes as she clung to him  at last i know she
said softly  now i do not mind what comes

     call narli and bring all the rifles there are in the house he exclaimed
coming back from his dream to the reality of the situation but she did not
the track of midnight



seem to hear him as she still clung to him murmuring at last at last
i know   

    mary let go  quick  theyre here   he cried as he strove to break
from her grasp

   as he spoke he heard the gallop of horses outside the door and throwing
his rifle forward he waited with his finger on the trigger

    the horses wildly ridden were pulled up in their stride opposite the door-
way and wilton saw giles white and excited leap from the back of one

    whats all this  he cried as he dashed into the house and stood look-
ing at wilton to whom mary was still clinging  have you gone mad 

    come inside before he sees you or youre a dead man   wilton replied
as reaching forward he caught giles by the arm and pulled him into the
house

    who sees me  what do you mean  he exclaimed

    midnight look at the bullet mark on the door and theres another
on the veranda  

    nonsense man youre mad  midnight would never dare to attack
my house

    but he has or one of his gang the man whoever he is fired at me
from those bushes and i believe hes there still

    then ill go and arrest him giles cried as he turned to go out again

    no father dont be so rash   mary exclaimed as she let go of wilton
and caught hold of giles  theyll shoot you if they see you  

   he shook her roughly off  its time for action he said as he sprang
into the saddle wilton followed and jumping on to the other horse they
rode to the clump of bushes wilton momentarily expected to see a puff of
smoke and feel the twinge of a bullet or see his companion fall  but nothing
of the sort occurred they reached the bushes and wilton pointing to
where his bullet had cut the stem said   thats where he was when i fired  

   they dismounted and searched among the patch of undergrowth but the
only evidence they could find was the impression made where a man had lain
at full length immediately behind the bush whose stem had been cut by the
bullet from wiltons rifle

    youre right some ones been there and a near shave he had if he was
there when you fired   giles exclaimed

    now it is time to rouse the country   wilton cried

    i doubt if its any good now hell be fifty miles away before we get
out for hell think this is getting too hot for him to stay we should have
started yesterday to catch him only we didnt know he was coming

    let us track him now wilton said  we ought to be able to see his
footprints on the soft ground and he must have left a clear track through
the bushes

    wait till i get my rifle i dont fancy going after midnight with empty
hands giles answered

   he rode away to the house and presently came back with his rifle wilton
in the mean time searching for some token to point the direction of the bush-
rangers flight but he was not keen enough to discover the signs which to


the track of midnight

a black fellows eyes would have beeu as plain as a high road in bent twigs
and trampled glass blades nor was giles any more successful and after an
hour or so of fruitless search they had to abandon their task and return to
the house

     whats to be done now   giles asked as they rode along

    i think i had better ride over to johnsons and get as many together
as i can and then come back with them and search the country round and
especially in the ranges where warrigal said he had his hiding place

   -	that means a fortnights delay for me before i can start after that
stock giles said in a dissatisfied tone

     but you could not travel by yourself now with that unscrupulous villain
about wilton answered

     i could take care of myself right enough only i dont like going and
leaving the place until i know he is away

     then ill ride straight off and get all i can to come over and well see
if he is to be found in the district

    but this expedition was as fruitless as the others had been then wilton
determined to take johnson into his confidence and acting  the information
given him by warrigal the two made their way one night down a narrow
pathway to a neighboring cliff which was to lead them they knew not
whither

chapter xv--an ugly suspicion

   as the track descended it also widened until they found that they were
walking down a ledge some six feet broad how far from the top of the
gully they were they could not even surmise in the dark

   uet me have a look over the side wilton said and he crept to the
edge aud looked down then he softly whistled for his companion and
johnson went to him

     uook there  isnt that the reflection of a fire   he asked

   johnson looked in the direction he indicated and saw a faint glimmer of
light showing among the trees below he watched it for some time without
speaking

     its a fire all right he said at length  i thing it is situated on the
other side of a spur seeing how the reflection is cast the track evidently
passes down close to it  

    theres a tree growdng pretty near wilton said pointing towards a
patch of darker shadow a little farther down the track  shall we go on
and see if we can climb down it  we may get to the bottom of the gully
that waj

    we can try johnson answered and the moved downwards

    the tree however was some distance away from the track but the side was
not so steep at that place and another ledge seemed to shoot out towards it
a little distance below

    we must get down on to that   johnson said

    you go on and ill stay to give you a hand down wilton answered
the track of midnight



   johnson carefully lowered himself down on to the second ledge and
going to the end of it found that he could easily reach the lower branches of
the tree the trunk of which glimmered through the shadow below

    come along he whispered to wilton and in another moment the two
stood together

    we must swing into the tree and slide down the trunk he continued

    go ahead   wilton replied briefly and johnson caught the nearest
branch and clambered up and along until he reached the main stem there
he turned to call to wilton to follow when his heart stood still for his eyes
could just make out two or three dark figures rapidly moving aloug the nar-
row track they had so recently left fearful of discovering his hiding place
if he made a sound to warn his companion and trembling lest he should not
have noticed or heird the approaching figures johnson clung to the tree
pressing himself closely against the trunk and striving to pierce the gloomy
darkness

   the figures came on quickly moving so silently that he felt convinced
they were walking barefoot but he was too far off to be able to make out
more through the darkness than that they were moving rapidly they
passed above the lower ledge upon which he had left wilton standing and
he breathed mere freely for he felt that they had not seen wilton or himself
he followed them with his eyes until he could see them no more and then
glanced towards the ledge again

   from out of the deep shadow cast by the bank upon the second ledge he
just caught a glimpse of wilton stepping forward when he heard voices far-
ther down the track wilton also heard them for he sank down into the
shadow again and lay close pressed to the wall of rock

   two figures walking more slowly and making more noise as they went
than the first batch loomed through the darkness their voices were in-
distinct until they arrived opposite the tree where johnson was hid there
they stood talking for a few moments

   ill go back and take the horses round now one of them said  both
of them will be asleep and the niggers will have spears through them by
the time you get up there so i shall want all my time to get round by the
creek 

    its a poor sort of way to settle old plovers account the other an-
swered  we could easily have brought them down here and made them
run for the niggers to have a go at id have burnt the chap that shot
plover  

   well you can bet the boss has something else in the wind itll put
the fear of the gang into the rest of them when they find their new leader
served the same as doolan

    and in the same place too the other laughed  but ill be hurrying
or the job will be over before im there to superintend

   he turned and strode up the track and the other went down when the
sound of their footsteps had died away johnson saw wilton creep out of the
shadow and reach up to the branch as he scramble up johnson slid down
the trunk to the ground where wilton joined him


the track of midnight

   did you hear them he asked as he landed  it was you and me
they were talking about  

    i suppose it was johnson answered  and i suppose too that the
man who passed us was the boss

    midnight   wilton exclaimed  and we did not shoot him  

   just as well i think for we should have had the whole gang on our
heels directly after but its lucky were here and not camping up above
they mean business all right

   we are not out of it jret though what are we to do now we are
here  

    i fancy we had better wait where we are for a time from what that
chap said about the horses i believe there will be a move down below before
long they may be all off and then we can travel more comfortably

     we might try and get a little nearer that fire if we keep under the
shadow we may be able to see who they are  

   it was a risky proceeding but they managed to make fair progress until
the gleam of the fire showed more distinctly and they could catch sight of the
smoke as it slowly rose and curled along the broken rock

    it looks very much like a cave to me johnson whispered

   if we could get up there we might be able to look down on them
wilton answered indicating a point which stood forward above the gleam
well try johnson whispered

   they decided to climb up first and try to reach the track which they
believed was between them and their goal it was a terribljr hard climb in
the darkness and with the necessity for absolute quiet but they managed it
and struck the track just where it curved in its downward path on the
other side of the curve they found the rock more broken and were able to
squeeze and crawl along helping each other and themselves as best they
could until they reached a point directly above the smoke as well as they
could make out they were on a rough ledge which jutted out from the main
wall of rock and rose along its edge into an irregular parapet on which there
was a thick growth of rank herbage but the climb they had managed had
tried their strength so much that for some minutes they could only lie pant-
ing at the back of the parapet

   when he had managed to get his breath again johnson whispered

    if were found here it will be a case of fight to the last

    the odds are in our favor the situation will enable us to withstand
their attack wilton replied

    all the same we shall have to take care what we are doing a false step
and it is all up  

    i dont hear anything wilton said after a few minutes silence

    we must creep to the edge and look over johnson answered

   they wrriggled nearer to the edge and peering through the tangled vegeta-
tion which grew along it they saw below them what was evidently the mouth of
a fairly large cave a fire was burning slowdy in front of it and beyond that
some saddles and riflqs were thrown in a heap the bush grew to within a
few yards of the opening and as they looked a man appeared leading two
the track of midnight



horses which he proceeded to saddle when he had completed that he
moved towards the cave pausing as he passed the fire to kick the logs closer
together with the result that a brighter flame shot up

    thats enough we dont want the bush afire a surly voice said from
the interior of the cave

   he answered with an imprecation and continued his way into the cave

    wilton forgetful for the moment of his position was anxious to see where
the man went and as he passed under the rock craned his neck forward
but he was still too far back to get a view of the cave and he leaned his hand
on the edge of the ledge in order to give himself a better position his
weight told on the half decomposed stone and the part where his hand rested
gave wa and fell with a loud clatter his arm at the same time slipping down

   the man who had brought up the horses rushed out and looked up as
johnson pulled wilton back

    whats that  he exclaimed looking straight up to where the two men
were cowering

   a harsh laugh came from the cave and a well known voice exclaimed

     youre a brave chap to be scared of a wallaby  

    great kingdom   johnson exclaimed and he clutched wilton by the
arm as in a vise when he heard the familiar tones

   now who is midnight  wilton whispered hoarsely

    douglas as im a living being   johnson gasped naming a man who
had gone with them on their last expedition and of whom giles had always
been suspicious

    whist   wilton whispered as the sounds of angry voices came up from
below they bent their heads towards the edge again and listened

      go on with the horses or you  miss jour mates   they heard douglas
say

     clear out sharp and dont stand there like an owl the surly voice they
had first heard said

   the mau they had seen came from under the shadow of the rock swear-
ing loudly he walked to the horses and mounting one rode off into the
bush leading the other the murmur of voices came from the cave but not
distinctly enough for the listeners to hear the words they lay with their
heads on the ledge until the sounds ceased and the fire grew dull then
johnson whispered to wilton that they had better be off

    up or down  wiltou asked

     well take the track and trust to luck johnson replied

     is it not risky   wilton said

     i hope it is i could put up with anything now johnson replied in a
bitter tone

   they crept cautiously down and on to the ledge along which they
went as rapidly as they could hearing nothing and meeting nothing until
they arrived at the fallen tree there was a faint gray coming into the
eastern sky when they reached the top

     shall we look for the passage   wilton asked

     better climb over ttie top johnson answered as he clambered up


the track of midnight

   but wilton preferred to try the way the man had gone who had passed
them and he crept into the hole that showed black under the rock he
discovered that by going on his hands and knees he could creep through the
narrow passage and emerged behind the roots of the tree which had
evidently been blown over in some storm he climbed on to the trunk and
rejoined johnson

     we know their secret now   he exclaimed

    yes and its the bitterest thing i ever learned too johnson answered

    you mean about douglas  

    i do ive known that man for years and i would as soon have trusted
him as myself and yet here he is in the middle of his gang   

      it will be great news for giles   

    for heavens sake dont tell him  at least not yet he would crow
over us and me in particular for the rest of his life no we must keep this
to ourselves wilton

   but they had no chance to tell giles as on their return to billah mary
announced that her father had gone to sydney wilton went on to toom-
bul with johnson and here warrigal turned up again with the information
that he could now guide them to midnights special hiding place

     but supposing it is only the cave that we discovered    johnson sug-
gested

   it is not i told him about that and he said that was the place where
the gang met but that midnights was away from it

chapter xvi-face to face

   they carefully loaded their rifles and mounting their horses rode
slowly after the black fellow he walked along silently and rapidly leading
them through the bush without a pause until they found that they were
nearing broken country and at the same time the daylight began to fade

    we shall have to go on foot johnson said  we cannot ride in the
dark in this rough region  

    we can keep alongside him easier too wilton answered

   they called to warrigal to stop and explained their intention

    by and by ou leave it horses in gully he replied

   but where is the gully johnson asked it will be dark almost
immediately  

   just over there warrigal said pointing plenty light till then 

   hurry along then if it is to be done wilton said and warrigal
started off again at a more rapid rate

   there was just light enough to see what they were doing when he led
them into a narrow blind gully which turned out of a larger one its en-
trance being almost obscured by a clump of thickly growing mimosa

    its a grand spot to leave the horses johnson observed or for the
matter of that to camp here ourselves

     how far now to the cave    wilton asked

   the black standing near them raised his hand
the track of midnight



    you keep plenty quiet my word midnight all round

    this would not be a bad place for him johnson said

    you get it rifle ready   warrigal asked

    both ready wilton answered

     by and by we go along quiet no speak plenty soon find it cave
sit down and wait sun come up midnight wake up come out bang
bang midnight he fall dowm dead he accompanied his brief disjointed
oration with expressive gestures and danced round the two at his concluding
words

    youve arranged it all johnson said with a hearty laugh

   when you shoot it you aim there warrigal exclaimed placing his
hand in front of his eyes

    hes ahvays telling me that wilton said

    there may be something in it johnson answered  in the mean time
we may as well arrange our plans in case things should turn out as he says
because it will be no use trying to discuss them when we are alongside the
cave

     we might challenge him to surrender if as warrigal says he comes out
when the sun gets up

    one will have to do that and the other will have to rest under shelter
and cover him he is bound to make an attempt to escape and then-well
the one under shelter must fire

   it was the best plan they could think of and agreeing that wilton
should challenge him and johnson stay out of sight they explained their
scheme to the black he could not understand why they should not fire
directly they saw their man whether he was asleep or awake moving or
standing and the idea of capturing him alive was quite out of the question
in his opinion

    well we will try it anyhow johnson said  now we will start for
the cave

   warrigal led the way from the gully and up the steep bank of the larger
one the two white men following close upon his heels at the top of the
bank he stopped and bent down to the ground

    plenty quiet he whispered and resumed his walk going very slowly
and carefully down the gully which lay on the other side of the rise they had
just climbed

   they soon found that they were walking down a narrow well defined path-
way which turned and twisted round boulders and trees until it was impos-
sible for either of them to say in which direction they were traveling the
night was very dark and as they descended lower they had to walk hand in
hand warrigal leading with johnson in the rear and wilton in the center

   then the ground became level and they went along straight for some
distance through what appeared to be thick bush judging by the even greater
darkness suddenly warrigal stopped again and lifted wiltons arm until it
pointed

    him sleep there he whispered

   wilton turned to johnson and repeated the information


the track of midnight

    but where are we  it is as dark as a pit johnson whispered

    by and by sun come up the black answered when they asked him

     and i suppose we can sit down and wait  

    plenty quiet warrigal replied

   they sat down with their rifles on their knees as the only thing to be done
uutil enough light should come for them to see where they were and what
they were doing the place was wonderfully still and quiet

    i wonder where we are is it near the big cave  johnson said in a
very soft whisper

   a gentle rustle of some leaves checked him and for the remainder of the
night they sat still and silent at last the sky directly overhead began to
grow a little less dark and the forms of the trees to stand out from the pre-
vailing shadow and they knew that dawij was at hand they glanced round
for their guide but he had disappeared in the darkness they were in a
place that was apparently entirely surrounded by vegetation thick and im-
penetrable in front of them there was a low boulder standing close to a
vine covered face of rock and round it a narrow track curved

   are we trapped johnson said as soon as they could make out their
surroundings

    no  i believe in warrigal wilton answered

   but where is he  johnson asked

   a rustle sounded from somewhere among the trees and wilton held up
his hand

    quick be ready   he whispered  i will stand there he went on
indicating the shelter of the boulder  he may come along that path you
hide-

   before he could finish a footstep souuded distinctly  the pathway and
wilton sprang forward with his rifle ready as round the boulder the unmis-
takable form of midnight appeared

   he stopped in his stride as he caught sight of wilton and for a moment
the two men stood watching each other

   with a quick movement wilton raised his rifle to his shoulder and
covering the outlaw cried out  surrender or youre a dead man

   midnights lips parted in a loud laugh as he drew a pistol from his coat
pocket and took deliberate aim at his opponent

   wilton heard a report almost beside his ear and at the same moment his
finger pressed the trigger

    load  quick  load   johnson cried behind him and both hastily
began to recharge their rifles while yet the smoke from the two shots hung
between them and midnight as it slowly dispersed they saw the man still
standing with leveled pistol but at the same instant that they could see
him he was also able to see them and the flash aud report of the pistol told
johnson that advantage had been taken of the opportunity tc reply to their
shots wilton engrossed in the reloading of his rifle had not looked up
and he uttered a sharp cry as he felt a numbing twinge in his chest and stag-
gered back under the force of the blow

   the cry following upon the shot aroused johnson to the danger of his
the track of midnight



own position while he stood where he wras and acted as a target for midnight
clubbing his rifle he sprang forward through the smoke towards the spot
where the outlaw had been a moment before  but when he dashed through
the thin cloud he found that midnight had fled he plunged through the
undergrowth and round the boulder from behind which midnight had ap-
peared and glanced keenly and quickly around but without seeing anything
save bushes and rock he was for the moment nonplussed and paused
hesitating whether to proceed or return to wilton  then he heard the sound
of a shout from down the gully and wiltons voice calling him

    its warrigal wilton exclaimed as he reappeared  load your rifle
and mine theres treachery in this

   you are badly hurt johnson cried as he caught sight of wilton lying
on his side with a blanched face and a red stain spreading over the front of
his shirt

    never mind now quick and load wilton gasped as the shout came
again from down the gully nearer and more distinct than it had been be-
fore

   johnson rapidly completed the operation of loading both rifles and then
turned to his friend

    let me help you under cover he said  it is no use waiting in the
open for those brutes to pot at you

   he stooped over wilton and raised him to his feet but the exertion
was too much for the wounded man and he stumbled forward slipped from
his comrades arms and fell heavily to the ground the sound of some one
crashing through the undergrowth behind him caused johnson to turn just
as warrigal and douglas leaped out on to the open patch where he was stand-
ing he made a dash at his rifle and seizing it aimed at douglas as he
cried

     stand off or i fire 

   douglas stopped and looked at him steadily

    fire if you like johnson  though it would be a poor testimony of your
friendship to kill me at the moment of m escape

   warrigal had slipped past johnson as he challenged douglas and knelt
down by the side of wilton calling upon him in his broken english to
speak and say he was not dead

    your escape johnson exclaimed

    certainly  my escape from the gang that captured me the day we were
out that black fellow there did the trick for me an hour or so since and
told me you two were waiting to shoot midnight- 

    but-but you are midnight we heard you in the cave it is no use
hiding it now johnson interrupted savagely

   douglas threw down the rifle he was carrying and held out his arms

    if i am midnight then shoot me where i stand he cried

    baal it midnight baal it midnight  that pfeller no no johnson heard
as warrigal sprang in front of him  poor massa meleelee im dead sure

    shoot me if you dont believe me johnson and then look after wilton
douglas said quietty


the track of midnight

    i believe you johnson answered slowly  but-

    never mind the rest ill explain after wilton needs all our attention
now douglas rejoined

   at the first glance it looked as if wilton was beyond the reach of their
attentions for he lay bleeding copiously from a wound in his chest and ap-
parently lifeless with such means as they could devise they stanched the
bleeding and bound up the wound

    we must get him away from here sharp or it will be all up with him
douglas said as they proceeded with the bandaging

    but how are we to move him  johnson asked

    there was only one man in the cave where they hid me and the black
fellow settled him  but there are a couple of horses and some blankets send
the black fellow for them and we will make a sling to carry wilton if he can-
not sit a horse douglas replied

   warrigal as soon as the suggestion was made to him supplemented the
scheme behind the boulder he said was a small cave which midnight used
as a secret hiding place and which was only known to one or two of the gang
he was for carrying wilton there before starting for the horses

    i did not see it when i was behind the boulder just now johnson
remarked

    suppose you come now warrigal exclaimed

    look at it johnson while i stay with wilton douglas added

    he may be hiding there johnson excitedly whispered  we fired at
him and when the smoke cleared he stood there and he pointed to the spot
 he held a pistol in his hand and shot wilton when i jumped for him but
when i got through the smoke he had disappeared

   douglas looked up from the knot he was tying in the strip of flannel
which did duty for a bandage

    why did you not say that before  he said  get your rifle well
both go

   they whispered their suspicions to warrigal

   my word yes yes plenty like it the black fellow answered as he
stepped lightly towards the boulder closely followed by the two men with
their rifles ready

   warrigal crept stealthily round it and stopped listening intently then
he pointed and following the direction johnson saw a vine straggling over
a ledge in the rock the black fellow pressing himself against the boulder
stole silently along until he was almost beside the trailing tendrils of the
vine he peered cautiously around and then rose to his feet with a chuck-
ling laugh and pushed the vine on one side revealing the narrow entrance to
a small cave he turned towards the two wdth a laugh on his face when a
shot echoed from high on the other side of the gully and warrigal fell to the
ground

   douglas sprang forward and looked upwards the wreath of smoke
floated calmly among the rocks and the vegetation on the top of the bank
but there was nothing else to indicate the whereabouts of the man who had
fired the shot
the track of midnight



    look out  johnson cried  keep under cover

     well have to get out of this as fast as we can or we shall all be picked
off like that douglas exclaimed as he rejoined his companion and glanced
at warrigal who lay where he fell with a bullet wound showing in his head

   but what about wilton hes not dead and we cannot leave him
johnson said

    we must carry him douglas answered  one carry him while the
other keeps a lookout the blacks as dead as a doornail

   they stepped back to wilton he had come to again and was leaning
upon one arm and glancing vacantly from side to side

    try to hang on to my back johnson said to him  heres douglas
we were mistaken about him but theres no time to talk now pull yourself
together if you can till we get you out of this

   wiltons head was swimming and his mind was mazy and confused as he
felt himself being hoisted up on johnsons back he held on as well as he
could not quite understanding why and only dimly realizing that he was
being carried somewhere wondering now and again why he was taken over the
roughest ground while there was a good open space near at hand then he
noticed that the place was steep and evidently hard to climb until at last he
sank to the ground once more and went away into darkness just as he heard
some one say  thank god were at the top

                     

chapter xvii-terrible news

   when wilton was again able to look around him and intelligently under-
stand what he was looking at he found himself lying  a stretcher bed in-
side a fire lit room while in front of the fire two men sat with their backs
towards him smoking and conversing in a low tone

    johnson he said fancying that he recognized the voice of one of the
speakers  but the sound of his own voice coming weak and thin and the
effort it cost him to speak at all surprised him so much that when he saw
one of the men turu and reveal the face of douglas instead of that of john-
son it seemed quite in keeping with the other incongruities of his mind

   the man rose and came over to him wilton watching him with wondering
eyes there was no doubt but that it was douglas the dim uncertain mind
told itself slowly trying to grasp why it should question the reality

    are you awake again old fellow  douglas asked bending over him

   yes have i been asleep theres a-where is this wilton
answered disjointedly

    this is toombul youre not too well so dont worry but take things
easy for a day or two johnsons in the next room having a camp hes
been with you all day so dick the stockman aud i are taking our spell

    whats wrong   wilton asked feebly i feel all played out and
there is something-

    dick had also risen from his seat by the fire and had come over to douglas
carrying in his hand a pannikin he had taken from beside the fire   a drop
might do him good he whispered

      e


the track of midnight

   take a pull at this douglas said as he interrupted wilton to offer
him the pannikin   dick made it he boiled down almost a bullock into
a half gallon of water and says it will put you right in two days if youll
drink it

   the two men raised him up and he drank the warm liquid that was in
the pannikin

    itll make a man of him in a week dick whispered to douglas as
wilton layback feeling refreshed and revived by the draft just do a
bit of asleep mr wilton and youll buck into shape in an hour dick
added to the sick man who tacitly accepting everything he was told closed
his eyes and drifted into slumber

   when next he awakened he found that it was daylight and his body felt
more of the vigor of life than it had done the night before he glanced
towards the fireplace and saw johnson standing there and looking at him

     i dropped the lid of the billy i was afraid it would disturb you he
said as he came over to wilton  how do you feel now they told me you
came round in the night dont move he added quickly as wilton made
as if to rise

     what is it i cannot get the hang of things at all wilton said irri-
tably  was douglas here i thought i saw him

    just keep quiet and youre all right johnson answered you had
a bit of a twister a week or so since but i reckon youre well over it now
have some more of dicks stew he swears it is what has saved you

     its good stuff wilton said   but tell me all about this affair i feel
played out and what is all this on my chest 

     you take things easy for a day or so longer and trust to us to look after
you then when you can get up well go over the yarn again johnson
replied

    he was as good as his word and all that wilton could get out of him was
the praise of dicks stew which he insisted was the only tiling that saved
wilton and enabled him a few days later to get about again then johnson
told him all the story of the adventure in the gully and made the confused
memory clear

   we were wrong in both firing at once johnson said as they sat and
talked the matter over

   it is the last thing i clearly remember wilton answered after
that i am all confusion tell me exaeth what took place

     well midnight had you covered with his pistol and fired at you as soon
as the smoke from our shots cleared away you fell and i jumped for him
but he had gone before i could reach him you called me back as you heard
warrigal coming and feared treachery but there was  treachery about poor
warrigal he had found douglas chained in a cave down the gully where
we heard him that night and had let him free after knocking the one mem-
ber of the gang who was there on the head douglas can tell you his yarn
himself  he will be back here tomorrow night all that i can say is that
warrigal set him free and brought him along to help us but when he ap-
peared i thought he was midnight and came near shooting him before i
the track of midnight



realized my mistake as it was we turned our attention to you and while
doing so that cold blooded fiend midnight picked off poor warrigal with
a rifle shot fired from up the gully douglas and i saw that it was no use
staying where we were unless we also wanted to be picked off so we started
for home  

    but how did i get here wilton asked

    oh you came along all right johnson answered

    yes but how  wilton persisted

    we hauled you up the gully johnson answered  it was easy work
after that

   the memory of being lifted up and carried slowly and laboriously and of
the voice exclaiming  thank god were at the top come to wilton and
reaching out his hand he gripped that of his companion he wanted to say
something but the words stuck in his throat and he could only gaze at the
fire and pull hard at his pipe and for some minutes the two men sat in silence
wilton reviling himself because he could not express all the gratitude he felt
to the man who had saved his life and johnson blaming himself for having
owned up to it  he would have done the same for me he mused  i
need not have made a song about it 

   the silence continued until it became oppressive to each of the simple
hearted plucky britons who shrank instinctively from anything approaching
a scene then johnson reached down for the pannikin that stood near the
fire

    have some more of dicks stew he said as he handed the pannikin to
wilton

     its good stuff the latter answered as he took it

     yes  its what saved your life johnson replied

   the following evening saw douglas again at toombul johnson had not
explained that he had ridden over to billah to let mary know what had be-
fallen wilton now that he seemed to be recovering but had said he had gone
away for a day or so in case his presence worried wilton during his early
convalescence

    why should it   wilton asked when johnson told him

    well you were a bit queer in the head once or twice and you raved
about midnight and douglas being one as we thought you know he
might have added that it was his own idea that if mary would come over
her presence night do more for wilton than anything else expecting to
see her he wondered when douglas did not return as early as he should have
done he wondered more when he saw douglas ride up alone and with a
terribly hard set face

     wheres wilton   he exclaimed quickly

    over at the house wheres the girl  

    billahs in ashes douglas answered  and giles has gone with it

    you dont mean it   johnson cried

    and i found this douglas went on producing a white handkerchief
on which there had been stained in red the words account settled mid-
night
o

the track of midnight

   johnson looked at it blankly his thoughts reverting at once to his
friend

     we cant tell him he said quickly

   not yet douglas answered

    luckily i didnt breathe a word to him where you had gone johnson
went on

      i had a look round for tracks   douglas interrupted  they followed
their usual mode attacking from all sides and riding off in different direc-
tions aud then crossing and recrossing each others trails well have to
raise the country over this  

     but what has become of the girl   johnson asked

   wilton hearing the voices had come to the door of the house and
douglas caught sight of him  dont talk about it now  there he is he
said as he got out of his saddle aud walked up to the house

   my word youre looking yourself again already he said as he went
up to wilton  in a week from now youll be all right

    thanks to you and johnson and-

   dicks stew yes thats the joker johnson called out interrupting
him

     you came along the billah road didnt you  wilton said turning to
douglas  did you see-

     by the way douglas wilton is very anxious to hear your yarn john-
son interrupted quickly  i didnt care to tell it for you seeing you would
be back today

   theres not much to tell douglas began while johnson slipped
behind wilton and shook his head vigorously  but i can give it to you
when-hullo whats this he broke off suddenly as he caught sight of a
black fellow passing the window

   the next moment a stalwart aboriginal streaked with ocher aud holding
a war spear in his hand entered the room and stood just inside the door-
way

    hullo my hearty what name belongayou johnson cried springing to
his feet

    meleelee man  toombul man  billah man no good  the black said
 gib it tucker  plenty black fellow want it tucker he went on waving his
hand towards the outside of the house   me show it billah girl  plenty
flood  my word  

   douglas and johnson looked at each other while wilton cried out as he
stepped towards the black  quick  what is it  

     billah big fire  billah girl say  quick tell meleelee man  flood come
down me plenty dead soon 

   billah burnt mary-flood-dead wilton gasped oh my
god   he cried as he staggered back

   hold up man-hold up johnson cried as he caught him you
talk their lingo douglas  ask him what he means

    douglas made free with what food was on the table and ta king the black
fellow outside shouted to dick to give him enough to feed himself and
the track of midnight



his companions then he hastened back to the room where he found
wilton lying full length on the floor and johnson trying to force some rum
between his lips

chapter xviii-a race for rescue

   for a long time wilton remained unconscious for so long indeed that his
two comrades began to despair of his ever coming round

    get him on to the bed douglas said as soon as he rejoined johnson
and together they lifted him and carried him over to the bed where they had
placed him when they carried him home from the gully

    what about the girl    johnson asked

    the blackiellow says she and the old gin have been taken captive by
the blacks and are in a humpy the gang have up moggill creek theres a
big fresh coming down from the ranges and they expect a flood so we had
better hurry as fast as we can there were only two men in charge the black
said

    but we cannot leave wilton like this

    no one of us will have to stay-unless he comes out of this fit-when
we can tell him we are going to the rescue and leave him in dicks hands

   it was a good suggestion johnson thought and the two agreed to carry
it out and start for moggill creek directly they found wilton was able to
understand what they were doing but when he did recover his senses again
and heard the f all story the blackfellow had to tell he also wanted to go to
the rescue

    you cannot stand it johnson told him  it will be a rough trip in the
dark and we may have to swim our horses over you are not strong enough
for that yet  

   douglas joined his voice in trying to persuade wilton from any such in-
tention as he had expressed

    when we get back we shall all start for sydney at once and you will
want what strength you have for that journey dont delay us now

   wilton lay back weak and anxious he wanted to go but felt the force
of his friends words

    all right he said  but dont lose time

   the blacks gave a minute description of the situation of the humpy and
also of the shortest route to follow to reach it  but nothing could induce
them to retrace their steps that night the next day they would go but not
before

   it was no use arguing with them so handing wilton over to dick john-
son and douglas saddled their own horses and leading two others they set
out fully armed and equipped with everything they thought might be
wanted

   the night was moonless but they were able to follow the billah road as
far as the place where the house had stood then they turned off into the
bush and rode more slowly in the direction the blacks had indicated the
route was rough and difficult but the necessity of haste urged them forward


the track of midnight

and they kept their panting horses at it until they heard a dull roar in the
distance

   the meaning was clear to each of them and neither spoke  they only sat
the tighter in their saddles and urged their horses into a quicker pace till
the sound of the rushing waters was distinct and near at hand

    we have struck the bluff they said was opposite the humpy douglas
said shortly as he stopped his horse and dismounted

   johnson followed his example and securing the animals they advanced
cautiously on foot

   the roar sounded louder in their ears and dimly through the dark of the
night they saw below them a wide stretch of rushing water as they
stood each man straining his eyes to penetrate further through the gloom
neither spoke although the same thought was in each ones mind gradu-
ally they made out the dark shadow of standing trees somewhere in the
middle of the expanse  but the trees were not very high above the surface
and certainly no humpy was ever built whose roof would reach to where the
water swept past the trees

   still the two men stood watching in silence each one hoping that the
other would be able to make out something he could not himself see but
which would give the lie direct to the growing conviction in his mind then
with one impulse each stretched out his hand and grasped his comrade by
the arm

   from across the waste of swirling hood there came another sound besides
the roar and rush and the hearts of the two men stood still as they heard
the faint muffled shrieks of women come from across the stream then the
shrieks became louder and they heard the words   help  help   

    thank god   douglas exclaimed and placing his hand to his mouth
he gave a loud long coo-ee

    the cries ceased and a shrill coo-ee answered his

    where are you   he shouted as loudly as he could and the one word
  roof   was all that they could hear of the answer

    can you hold on he shouted again

   the roar of the flood smothered the words that were sent in reply

    not long douglas shouted  not long   and as if it were an echo
from the other side came back the words  not long

   then he turned to johnson

     its a swim he said

    theres no other chance johnson replied

    shall we go together 

    better go singly if the first goes under-

   just so douglas interrupted  ill-try first 

   without further words they set about making arrangements for the at-
tempt which might result in the rescue of the two women or the drowning
of the two men taking with him a coil of light rope douglas suggested
entering the stream higher up

     i can go with the current and strike across for the trees he said quietly
 build up a big fire on the bluff here and it will guide me
the track of midnight



   he held out his hand and johnson grasped it

    good luck he said aud douglas strode rapidly away

   johnson piled up all the dry wood he could find upon the fire and peered
anxiously towards the dark line half way across the flood the minutes
dragged until it seemed that hours had passed since his comrade went away
he listened for an sound which would tell him that the two women were still
living or that douglas was safe  but nothing came to him save the crackling
of the fire and the roaring of the water he stood up and uttered a long
coo-ee then he heard two voices high and shrill answer him across the
flood and another from up the stream

    help is coming   he shouted and dimly heard but could not under-
stand the answer from the humpy

   when he left johnson douglas walked as rapidly as he could along the
bank until he came to a spot opposite and in a line with the trees among
which the humpy stood the light of the fire showed distinctly across the
water and he saw that the stream was narrower where he was and flowing
with a tremendous current stripping off his boots and coat he tied the
length of rope round his waist then he plunged in striking out with all his
strength diagonally across the river the current carrying him along with fear-
ful velocity around him the water bubbled and boiled and logs floating with
the current threatened a greater danger than the flood but he was a strong
able swimmer and he was well in the center of the stream when he saw the
clump of trees immediately before him the rush of water as it approached
the obstacle to its course divided and the hardest part of his task was to
prevent himself being carried out again he was spun round in the eddies
and almost dragged under as he neared the trees  then he seemed for a mo-
ment to have got into still water and in another second he was clinging
breathless and well nigh exhausted to the branches of a standing tree

   the force of the current was no longer so tremendous and as soon as he
had recovered his breath he struck out slowly and swam gently from tree to
tree until he saw the shadow of the humpy roof loom ahead of him a few
more strokes and he was alongside of it aud grasping a projecting sapling
he clambered on to it and upon the sloping bark

    where are you  he gasped fearful as he heard no one that he was
too late

     mr douglas    mary exclaimed as she recognized his voice

    yes he panted

    oh narli we are saved   she cried

   he struggled and clambered to the side where the two were clinging
then he shouted out the words that told johnson the fight was won so far

chapter xix-courage wins

   it was evident that nothing more could be done until morning and douglas
shouted over to johnson that they were quite safe until the dawn he kept
the fire blazing and the gleam of it was some small comfort to the three who
were clinging to the humpy roof otherwise they had but little to cheer


the track of midnight

them during the next two hours then the day broke and revealed to them
the fact that the water had touched its highest point and was rapidly falling

   to douglas the appearance of the sun was doubly welcome as it overcame
the coldness he had experienced from his saturated clothing

   the humpy will be out of the water in six hours he said encourag-
ingly

     if we could only have a fire mary answered as she shivered

    and something to eat douglas added can you swim he asked
suddenly

    a little mary replied  narli taught me

     theres a way to get out of this if you care to try it he said  its
a bit risky but we shall have to wait for hours before we can get the horses
over  

    there is a ford lower down i think she answered  it was the way
we came as far as narli and i can remember

     but the stream is too strong for it to be passable for hours yet he said

  if we could get some of this bark off we could fix up floats  

    and swim over through that current mary asked poiuting to
where the stream was visible through the trees

     its better than waiting he answered

    no good narli exclaimed  by um by flood all gone

     it will take a long time going douglas said

     no no narli persisted  soon flood all gone look  

    she pointed to the nearest tree stem the flood mark on which was already
some two feet above the water douglas remained sceptical but in half the
time that he had given for the water to leave the humpy they were able to
climb down through the hole the women had made when the- effected their
escape on to the roof

    narli hunted round until she found some of the small parcels of flour she
had tied up in pieces of blanket the water had soaked through the cover-
ing and had saturated the flour on the outside but inside it was dry and
there was enough in each parcel to serve for bread

   it was quickly kneaded and made into hasty cakes and with appetites
keen edged by their fasting vigil of the night before the three devoured them
as soon as they were cooked refreshed and reinvigorated by the meal doug-
las went outside the hut and found that the water was receding rapidly and
that already sufficient ground had become exposed for him to walk within
easy hailing distance of johnson

    he called out that there was a ford lower down and johnson replied that
he would ride along the bank of the stream and see whether he could get the
horses over

   a mile or so below the humpy he found that the stream spread out and
was comparatively shallow to what it was in the more confined course above
the water was still flowing at a great rate and he decided to wait an hour or
so before attempting to get over after a couple of hours he decided to
make the attempt

    he drove the horses in as high up as possible the water reached to the
the track of midnight



girths of the one he was riding until about the center of the stream when
it deepened until the horse was carried off its legs the three others
which were in front swam for the opposite shore and were again on their
feet twenty yards further ahead and from there until they reached dry
ground they were only up to their knees

   turning them up the stream he drove them at a smart gallop until he
arrived opposite the humpy there was still a fair sized creek running where
the track of sand had been before the flood but he again put the horses into
it and managed to get them over to the rise now an island on which the
humpy stood a few minutes later and he rode up and exchanged warm
greetings with the three who were awaiting him

    we had better not waste time here douglas said when they had each
told of their exferiences   now that the flood has gone down the gang
may come back to look for their prisoners  

    yes we had better get over to the other side and have a rest and a feed
there johnson assented

   mary and narli were even more anxious to leave the place and ignoring
the wet state of the saddles they all mounted and set off they succeeded
in getting over the small creek easily and rode quickly for the ford marys
spirits rising higher than the had been for many days

   as they approached toombul johnson galloped on ahead when he came
in sight of the station he saw wilton on the veranda and waved his hat to
him

    wheres douglas  wilton cried as he rode up

    coming aleng with the others johnson answered as he sprang from his
horse

   the others then-you have-

    we found them safe enough johnson replied as wilton grasped his
hand and once more failed to put his thoughts into words   i came on ahead
to fix things up a bit he added quietly and not until long after did wilton
learn all that was implied in the simple expression  we found them safe
enough  

   shortly the three came in sight and wilton hurried to meet them mary
slipped from her horse and heedless of all else wilton clasped her in his
arms

   my love my love he said as she clung to him sobbing

    oh that cruel midnight she moaned  he killed father and nearly
killed you

    but i am all right now he whispered  and we will go away to sydney
and get police and have that scoundrel hanged yet  

    oh it has been awful she moaned  i would have killed myself only
narli stopped me

    and that would have killed me he answered

    just before mr douglas came-- she began and then looking round

broke off where is he she exclaimed for douglas had continued on
his way with narli and marys horse and the two were standing by them-
selves


the track of midnight

    i forgot them wilton confessed  they have gone into the house
he linked his arm in hers and they walked together to the station at
the door johnson met them

    we have tea ready he said in an unconcerned tone

chapter xx-the mists rise

   in spite of the heavy strain on the endurance of douglas and johnson it
was late at night before the three men went to sleep mary and narli went
to their room soon after the meal was over and then the three sat round the
table smoking and debating what was the next thing to be done

   the last escapade of the gang showed them that something more would
have to be done to rid the country of the pest than the desultory campaigns of
the squatters had been able to accomplish

   the government must help us or we shall all be wiped out douglas
said forcibly  now that giles has been killed and his station burned to the
ground perhaps we shall be able to get some police to scour the district

   its the only remedy johnson assented we shall have to go to
sydney  

     thats it douglas exclaimed  you and wilton start off with the others
as soon as they are rested enough and ill stay on here and call all the
fellows round you can set me right too while you are down there he
added grimly

    theres not much fear about that wilton answered

   then well consider that settled douglas interrupted  you four
start off as soon as youre ready if you want any support down below tell
them every squatter in the place will come and we wont do a hands turn if
this gang is not wiped out

   they agreed to the proposal and in the morning wilton told mary she
wanted to start the same day but douglas and johnson both urged for a
couple of days rest before the journey was begun in the mean time the
party of black fellows was sent round to the different stations with messages
signed by johnson douglas and wilton calling them to meet at toombul as
soon as they could and telling them of the destruction of billah another
message was also given to the blacks for their own tribe and it was that they
could always have rations and blankets for the asking at either meleelee or
toombul as a recognition of what they had done in the rescue of mary

   two days later wilton and johnson accompanied by mary and narli
started for sydney aud traveled in easy stages down to the coast in the
early part of the journey they made their own camp at night but when they
came into more settled country they could always reach a homestead before
dark

   to the girl whose whole life had been spent away in the back blocks the
time occupied in that journey was all too brief every day bringing with it
some new pleasure in addition to the fact that the distance between them and
the metropolis was gradually becoming less and in the contemplation of
that fact mary found a satisfaction she had never known before when they
the track of midnight	

were within a days journey of the elder farrells homestead situated on what
was then the outlying settlement around sydney wilton rode on ahead to
convey the news and mary was strangely excited a new life was opening
before her and the next day she would see what for years she had longed to
realize

   there was a warm and hearty welcome given to wilton when he rode up
to the trim and comfortable cottage in which the parents of his friend
lived and the hospitable couple became more delighted when he told them
of the party who were following him mrs farrell bustled around immedi-
ately he mentioned that mary and he were going to get married

   ride back and show them the way while we get things fixed up
farrell exclaimed and wilton retraced his steps meeting the other three a
mile or so from the house they all increased their speed and cantered up
to the cottage hearing them mr and mrs farrell came from the interior
to welcome them wilton was at the time helping mary off her horse so that
she had her back towards the cottage when the couple came out

      and so this is the-  old farrell began gaily then as mary turned

round and he saw her face he stood still with wide open eyes and a startled
look staring at her

     this is mary wilton said before he noticed the amazement of farrell

     kate  come here kate  the old man said quickly reaching out a
hand towards his wife but still keeping his eyes on mary  whos that
he exclaimed pointing with his other hand at mary

    mrs farrell looked and screamed and running up to mary threw her
arms around her and held her closely as she exclaimed  my own dear mis-
tress  my poor dear mistress  oh thank god ive seen her again 

    mary looked from one to the other and then at wilton  what is it 
she asked tremulously

    farrell seized wilton by the hand and wrung it heartily as he slapped him
on the back and shouted  well done my lad im proud of you

     but what does it mean wilton asked

     mean  why lord love you shes the dead image of her mother and it
knocked me cold when i saw her

      my mother   mary exclaimed   did you know her   she said to mrs
farrell who was still hugging and kissing her

     know her why you poor darling of course i know her and so shall
you as soon as jim can ride over and fetch her 

    but she is- mary began

     here jim take one of the horses and quit sharp this aint no time
to wait the motherly woman cried turning to her husband ill take
charge of my dear young mistress till they come and wilton will look after
the rest

    she led mary into the cottage with narli at their heels while farrell
jumped on johnsons horse and shouting  i shant be long boys galloped
down the road

-	wilton and johnson looked at each other

     what does it mean  the former exclaimed


the track of midnight

      i should say we had better wait and see though it does look as if some
one had gone queer in the head johnson replied as he glanced down the
road along which farrell was riding furiously

    the two stood at the cottage gate waiting for some idea to come to them
which would explain the extraordinary action of the farrells

     we had better go inside johnson was saying when a cloud of dust
appeared down the road  here he comes back he added

    but besides farrell there was a buggy and in that buggy a lady and gen-
tleman they drove up to the gateway and sprang out

   major pearson wilton exclaimed as he stepped forward but the
major pushed past him and accompanied by his wife rushed into the cot-
tage wiltoli turned and looked after them angry and puzzled

     good iron my lad good iron  he heard old farrell exclaim as he
slapped him on the back and threw his hat in the air  im more pleased
than ive ever known  come and have a drink on it

     but what does it all mean johnson asked quietly

     mean farrell cried  why it means that youve found the majors
daughter  

     the majors daughter  wilton exclaimed

    a figure ran out of the cottage and up to the three and as wilton turned
to see who it was he met major pearson face to face he seized him by the
hands and shook them as he exclaimed in a broken voice

     god bless you my boy  god bless you my boy 

     is it she major farrell cried

    but the major was too much moved for words and as he nodded his head
in answer two tears glittered in the sunlight as they fell and told his com-
panions of the tumultuous joy that was in his heart

     come he said and led wilton into the cottage followed by johnson
and farrell at the door of the sitting room he stopped mrs pearson
with mary in her arms sat crying softly while mrs farrell watched them
her own eyes overflowing narli forgotten but not forgetting stood beyond
them looking from one to the other the major led wilton straight across
to his wife and taking one of her hands placed it in wilton s

   he found her he whispered and wilton felt the hand he held
tighten upon his own it was all that the mother could spare in that moment
of supreme joy

   later when matters had settled down into a calmer state wilton was
overwhelmed with tokens of the parents love and gratitude while johnsons
sturdy nature was reduced to distressful uncertainty in the presence of so
much emotional demonstration and narli-ugly black old narli-was
made the queen of the ceremonies and treated with a lavish generosity that
she utterly failed to comprehend for she was able to supply some informa-
tion which was invaluable and which so far as the pearsons were concerned
completely proved marys identity with the child who had been stolen from
their home in the early days of their married life

    narli had she said been carried off a long time ago from her tribe by a
white man who gave her a little white child to take care of they had
the track of midnight



gone a long way and always through the bush and away from the tracks
where white men usually traveled  for the white man was always telling her
to keep a sharp lookout for any traces of other white people and he would
never go near the tracks once a dray had overtaken them and they had
hidden while it came up and passed them a man was walking beside it and
a woman nursing a child was sitting in it angry words were being spoken
by both man and woman and the man stopped the dray very close to where
narli and her companion were hiding he kept on muttering to himself all
the time that he was lighting a fire and setting the billy to boil then the
woman came down from the dray with the child in her arms and said some-
thing to the man which made him rage and storm the woman laughed and
jeered at him until he snatched a rifle from the dray and fired point blank at
the creature who was tormenting him

   the woman fell where she stood and the man had run away when he saw
her fall when he had gone narli and her companion crept out of their
shelter and found both the mother and child dead the white man laughed
and taking up the dead child threw it behind a log bidding narli to go back
to her camp as he took the other little one from her

   but she was curious and crept back under shelter of the bush until she
could see all that took place at the half made camp of the drayman her
companion sat nursing the white child until the man who had shot the
woman came back as he did hours afterwards narli saw her companion
point to the dead woman and then hold out the child  aud the other man
had sat down on the log behind which the other child had been thrown with
his face hidden in his hands

   she saw her companion approach him and lean forward as though he were
emphasizing what he was saying the other man sprang to his feet and her
companion pointed in her direction then the white man who had shot the
woman took the child and narli hurried on to her camp as she saw her com-
panion set out towards it

   he was smiling grimly as he joined her aud told her that she would
have to travel with the other man and look after the little one then he
went on to tell her that she was never to mention what had occurred or he
would come and kill her he wtas he said going away and if she ever saw
him afterwards she was not to remember him and never to speak to or of him
nor tell the child when it grew up of what had taken place in the early por-
tion of its life

   narli had been handed over to the other man and the child had been given
to her to take care of again and from thenceforward she had had the care of
that child and she had kept the secret so well that not even giles ever sus-
pected that the girl who grew up as his daughter mary was in reality a
stranger to him and yet his own child had died at the same moment as its
mother when stung into a fury of raging jealousy by her taunts and jeers he
had in a momentary madness done that which clouded and marred all his sub-
sequent life

    and he died defending me mary said with tears in her eyes as she
recalled the scene on the night of the attack on billah when she was told to


the track of midnight

look on the veranda of the burning house and saw the fortn of a man lying
still within a few feet of the roaring flames

chapter xxi-run to earth

   although the pearsons were satisfied that mary was their child the
striking likeness between her and mrs pearson giving them proof enough
the question was not so easily settled in the eye of the law giles having been
reported as dead another victim of the gang he had done so much to
suppress the government decided that the grant of billah should be available
to the only child and mary was duly notified that the transfer would be made
to her if she desired it the major laid the whole matter before his solici-
tor who at once pointed out the difficulties which would arise were she to
deny her claim to giles estate

    better get the transfer through and settle the other affair among your-
selves he suggested the marriage of mary and wilton before the matter
was completed necessitated the substitution of another name for that of mary
giles and to dispose of the quibble for all time the property was made over
to wilton direct

   in the mean time he had been consulting doctors with regard to the bullet
wound he had received from midnight the wound itself had healed and
although a rib had been cracked and the bullet was embedded somewhere in
the muscles of the back the doctors asserted that  vital damage had been
done and nothing would be gained by trying to find and extract the bail
the only existing obstacle to the marriage having been removed the cere-
mony was performed the major giving the bride away and johnson officiat-
ing as wiltons best man

  at the subsequent gathering the major announced the belief that he and
his wife had in common as to mary being their stolen daughter legally he
told the astonished guests it was a difficult thing to prove  but as a matter
of belief both he and his wife accepted it and he was glad to have the oppor-
tunity of announcing that mary and her husband would be joint heirs to all
his property and his wifes when they were called hence

   then the happy couple united by a hundred ties went away for their
honeymoon which was to last until billah was rebuilt the superintendence
of which work johnson undertook he also undertook to explain to farrell
that meleelee had been transferred to him absolutely and to carry out both
tasks as quickly as possible he started on his homeward journey a day or so
after wilton and mary were married

   he posted rapidly along and arrived at toombul just in time to partici-
pate in the final escapade of midnight and his gang

   as he came within the boundaries of his property he picked up the track
of a heavy mob of cattle and saw by the state of the trail that they had been
driven along at a very much higher speed than was usual he pressed for-
ward and as he came in sight of the house saw the large mob in the home
paddock and half a dozen men round the veranda as he rode up he recog-
nized farrell and douglas
the track of midnight



     good luck to you old man youre just in time douglas cried out

    why what is in the wind  johnson exclaimed as he dismounted

     the house is to be burned down tonight douglas replied

   its this way farrell added we were on our road up when we
fell in with a couple of police who were on a roving commission and joined
our camp floods delayed us a bit and at some places the stock was not
ready for us so we are really some three months late but a days journey
from here when we did manage to get through we were stuck up by our
old friend

    midnight johnson exclaimed

   the same farrell replied he didnt know evidently we had
troopers with us and he and his men had a nasty time of it only himself and
two others getting away with their lives we suffered a bit too and made all
haste on here expecting to find you and wilton instead we found douglas
who made us comfortable and we decided to camp here until you and wilton
came back but a day or so since the black came and gave us the tip that to-
night midnight was going to burn the place down and wipe us all out we
sent word round and have so far managed to muster ten all good shots and
well armed you make the eleventh and as it is your house that is to be
burned you had better take the lead

   this is very encouraging johnson observed looking around at the
men

     weve drawn up a little scheme of our own douglas said  it means
the loss of the house but we think it will settle midnight once and for all

     whats the scheme  johnson asked

     we decided to lie outside under cover and wait if the tale the black
fellow brought is true midnight only has two white men with him now
that means he would set fire to the place at once and pick us off as we came
out instead of that we would pick him off he cannot well dodge half a
score bullets all at once and we were going to let him have a volley trusting
to luck to roll the others over  

    johnson thought for a few minutes in silence

     well soon run up a fresh shanty one of the men said

     what do you say   farrell asked

     its worth trying johnson answered at length

     i doubt if we shall ever want another chance at him douglas said as he
proceeded to give johnson the details of their scheme the places where they
would lie under cover had already been selected and as johnson went from
one to to another he saw how entirely the front of the house was commanded

     if every one fires at the same time it will be impossible for him to escape 
he exclaimed

     we think so farrell who was with him replied

      if he does--  johnson began and stopped it would not do to let too

many into the secret of the cave at the head of the gully he took an early
opportunity of speaking to douglas if he should escape he said  he
will make for the cave where wilton was shot you and i had better keep
the knowledge to ourselves and slip away after him


the track of midnight

    thats so douglas replied  we need not tell any one

   as the evening came on the men kept inside the station and had their
supper in silence as a precaution against warning any spies there might be
about as to their numbers then when it was dark they crept out one by
one and went to their allotted places to lie with rifles ready for the sight of
the man they wanted to shoot and the signal for their volley

   it was a moonless night and the hours passed without a sound occurring
by which the watchers could learn of the enemys approach until a faint
glimmer of light sped through the air and with a slight thud a spear buried
itself in the roof of the house aud the fiber tied round it burst into flame
two more followed and in another minute the dry sheets of bark were
ablaze the fire spread along the roof and as it increased lit up the surround-
ing bush and enabled the men lying in ambush to see three figures creeping
stealthily towards the veranda

   they divided one going to either end and the third standing boldly for-
ward in front of the door the ruddy light fell upon him and lit up his black
beard and locks

   douglas and johnson lay side by side and the latter softly whispered
 take the man on the right ill take the other and leave midnight to the
boys  

   silently they aimed while the remainder of the party held their fingers
on the triggers and waited for the signal shout that johnson was to give
for the volley

   midnight stood watching the growing fire and then burst into a loud
laugh

   at the same moment johnson shouted and the report of the volley cut
short the outlaws mirth the two men who were posted at either end of
the veranda fell while midnight staggered blindly forward and stumbled
with a yell of triumph the men sprang from their hiding places and rushed
upon him

   recovering himself he faced round and raised his rifle the charging
squatters scattered round him as he fired and under cover of the smoke he
dashed into the bush with all the men after him

   douglas caught johnson by the arm

    its a race for the cave   he exclaimed  hell double on them and
well go as hard as we can to get there before him

   without waiting to look at the two who were lying where they had fallen
and who as it happened were never to rise again douglas and johnson
rushed through the bush in the direction of the gully in which the cave was
situated once they stopped to reload their rifles and listen if any one else
were near them but they could distinguish nothing and resumed their march
the gray dawn was showing when they came to the edge of the steep bank
up which they had carried wilton they hastily clambered down and then
hastened along the gully till they reached the boulder at the end

    shall we go into the cave or hide up the bank  douglas asked

    into the cave johnson answered and they turned round the boulder
and pushing aside the trailing vine entered
the track of midnight	

   they found the cave was a small chamber formed by a projecting ledge
the underside of which sloped inwards leaving barely room for a man to
stand upright in the middle a couple of blankets thrown together with the
ordinary articles of a bushmans camp lying beside them were all the cave
contained	

   i think we shall be better on the bank johnson said as he glanced
round him

    theres not much here douglas answered as he held the vine back
and made as if to step out but a sound caught his ear and he grasped
johnson by the arm

    hes coming he wdiispered hoarsely

   there was the noise of some one treading heavily and clumsily beyond
the boulder and then a man staggered round it he groaned as he leaned
against it for a moment before he slipped weakly to the ground there was
no mistaking the jet black hair and beard but the face was ghastly pale
now and the swaggering form of the once redoubtable midnight was limp and
helpless

   as the two squatters stood watching him from behind the sheltering vine
a momentary twinge of pity passed through each as they saw the man make
a great effort to rally himself

   painfully he struggled to unloosen his coat and when he had it open they
saw under it a crudely heavily fashioned cuirass he pulled and tugged at
the straps with which it was fastened and as it fell from him he leaned back
against the boulder once more and gasped

   his head drooped forward on his hands and the watchers saw his fingers
working amongst his hair and then the mass of raven locks slipped over the
head carrying with them the beard and a roughly made helmet the exer-
tion of getting them off had almost exhausted the wounded outlaw and once
more he let his head rest against the boulder

   as his face became visible johnson and douglas started to their feet and
sprang towards him with loud cries the face of the stricken man was the
face of him whom they had long known as giles 

   he turned towards them and strove to get on his feet but he was too far
gone and rolled over in a swoon

   the two men stood over him too horrified to speak and too indignant to
feel even pity for the wretch whose life was ebbing away at their feet
slowly he regained consciousness and looked at them with malignant
hatred

    too late he gasped out and lay back dead

    thank god wilton does not know  johnson exclaimed

   he never shall nor his wife either douglas answered quickly

    but the story must leak out said the other

    only if you tell it douglas replied  we will bury him where he
lies and bury his secret with him

                                                              g firth scott

the river of darkness

a record of some marvelous experiences in the dark continent-why a water journey beneath
the earths surface was undertaken at frightful risks-a voyage on a raft along
an unknown course and without the possibility of retreat

prologue

tt was november in london the great city was buried under a dank
yellow fog traffic was temporarily checked  foot passengers groped
their way by the light of the street lamps and the hoarse shouts of the link
boys running before cabs and carriages with blazing torches rang at intervals
above the muffled rumble of countless wheels

   in the coffee room of a quiet hotel on the strand a young man stands by
the window looking pensively out on the misty street he is quite young
with light hair that falls half over his forehead and a drooping golden mus-
tache and in rather startling contrast to these a deep bronzed complexion that
tells of foreign lands and tropical suns

    captain chutney sir 

   it is a hotel servant with a big blue envelope in his hand and as the
young man wheels round he reveals the uniform and bright facings of a
captain of hussars

   yes i am captain chutney he replies to the servant thank
you and taking the blue document he stands for a moment in deep
thoughtfulness

   well may he hesitate to break that official seal which glares up at him so
broadly were the gift of futurity his and he could see mirrored before
him the dread panorama of events that are inevitably linked with that innocent
looking missive he would fling it with horror stricken hands into the coal fire
that burns on the grate beside him

   but no disturbing thought enters his mind the future looks bright and
cheerful enough just at present and ripping open the end of the envelope
without breaking the seal he pulls out a folded paper and reads 

                                coioniaiv office downing street s w

to captain guy chutney 

your immediate presence is requested on urgent affairs

             signed	---

                               secretary of state for colonial affairs

   chutney looks with some surprise at the famous signature attached with a
bold hand he places the letter in his pocket pushes open a swinging door
at the left and vanishes up a broad stairway

    in five minutes he reappears clad in a big mackintosh and calling a cab
he rattles off westward through the fog

he is not in the best of humors he had made other plans for the da
the river of darkness



for liis furlough is up and tomorrow he leaves for india to rejoin his regi-
ment he had come up yesterday from the country where he had put in a
week at grouse hunting with his brother sir lucas chutney and today he
intended bidding good by to old friends and attending to the making of a few
purchases

   downing street is not far away and presently the cab rolls into whitehall
and draws up before the big granite building

   guy makes his way through the spacious corridors thronged with clerks
civilians foreigners from every part of the globe and at last reaches the
private apartments of the chief

   the right honorable lord is deeply engaged but his private secretary
receives chutney cordially and leading him back into a still more secluded
and stately apartment motions him to a soft chair and sits down opposite
him

      captain cbutney   he begins abruptly   you leave for india tomorrow  
     india mail eight oclock in the morning guy replies briefly

    very well we are going to intrust you with a very important commis-
sion you will stop off at aden cross the gulf of aden in the semi weekly
steamer aud present these documents to sir arthur ashby the political
resident at zaila the fortified town of the somali coast protectorate  

   the secretary hands guy two bulky envelopes stamped and sealed with the
government seal

    they relate to affairs of importance he continues your gallant
record justifies us in intrusting the papers to your care you can return in
time to take the next steamer perhaps i had better tell you this much in
confidence the secretary adds 

    we have received from certain sources information to the effect that the
emir of harar on the southern border of abyssinia contemplates at no dis-
tant date an attack on zaila our garrison there is weak and as you prob-
ably know the somali country is treacherous and unreliable  these papers
contain necessary instructions for the political resident

   the secretary rises and guy gladly follows his example

    i will see that the papers are delivered he says earnestly

   thank you the secretary responds i am sure that you will i
wish you a safe voyage captain chutney and fresh burmese laurels for you
will  doubt take part in the chittagong expedition

   they shake hands warmly and in five minutes guy is rattling citywards
again through the increasing fog long afterwards he looks back on that
morning as the most memorable da of his life at present his commission
sits lightly on his mind he attends to all his duties in london catches the
india mail and two days later is steaming across the mediterranean on board
the p and o steamship cleopatra

chapter i-the stolen despatches

   steadily the cleopatra had traversed the mediterranean passed through
the suez canal plowed the burning waters of the red sea and now on this


the river of darkness

bright sultry day aden was left behind and with smoking funnels she was
heading swiftly and boldly for the indian ocean

   a smaller steamer a mere pigmy beside this gigantic indian liner had
left the harbor of aden at the same time and was beating in a southwesterly
direction across the gulf with a speed that was rapidly increasing the distance
between the two vessels

   on the upper deck stood guy chutney straining his eyes through a pair
of field glasses to catch a last glimpse of the cleopatra and distinguish if
possible the figures grouped under the white awnings he had only arrived
at aden last night and now he was bound for the dreary african coast while
all the gay friends he had made on board the cleopatra were steaming mer-
rily off for calcutta without him

   it was by no means a comforting state of affairs and guys spirits were
at their lowest ebb as the steamer finally faded into the horizon he put up
the glasses and strode forward from the lower decks came a confused babel
of sounds a harsh jabbering of foreign languages that grated roughly on
his ear

     this is a remarkably fine day sir

   it was the captain who spoke a bluff hearty man who looked oddly
out of place in white linen and a solar topee

   it is a grand day said guy  may i ask when we are due at
zaila

    at zaila  repeated the captain with a look of sudden surprise  ah
yes possibly tomorrow probably not until the following day

   it was now guys turn to be surprised

    do you mean to tell me he said  that it takes two or three days to
cross the gulf of aden

   no replied the captain bruskly  you are surely aware my dear
sir that we proceed first to berbera and from thence up the coast to zaila

    then you have deceived me sir cried guy hotly  you told me this
morning that this steamer went to zaila  

    certainly i did replied the captain  you didnt ask for any more
information or i should have told you that jve went to berbera first the
great annual fair has just opened at berbera and i have on board large
stores of merchandise and trading properties on other occasions i go to
zaila first but during the progress of the fair i always go direct to berbera
and unload i supposed that fact to be generally understood and turning
on his heel the captain walked off to give some orders to his men

   guy was half inclined to be angry at first but on reflection he concluded
he was just as well satisfied besides it would give him a chance to see that
wonderful african fair which he now remembered to have heard about on
different occasions

   but one other person was visible on the deck a short chunky man with
a dark complexion and crafty forbidding features

   a portuguese or a spaniard guy put him down for at once and he con-
ceived a deep mistrust of him instantly the fellow however was inclined
to be sociable
the river of darkness



      ah an englishman  he said coming up to guy and holding out his hand
an action which guy professed not to see

    you are going to berbera perhaps he went on nowise discomfited by
the rebuff

   no said guy shortly to zaila

   ah yes zaila you have friends there perhaps i too am ac-
quainted i know very well sir arthur ashby the governor at zaila

   his keen eyes scanned guys face closely and noted the faint gleam of
surprise at this information

   but guy was too clever to be thrown off his guard

   yes he said  i know some people here i have not the pleasure of
sir arthurs acquaintance

   he would have turned away at this point but the man pulled a card from
his pocket and presented it to him guy glanced it over with interest 

c manuel torres

trader at aden and berbera

   a vile portuguese slave hunter he thought to himself

    well mr torres he said  i am sorry that i have no cards about
me but my name is chutney

   the portuguese softly whispered the name once or twice then without
further questioning he offered guy a cigar and lit one himself

   manuel torres proved to be quite an interesting companion and gave guy
a vivid account of the wonders of the fair

   as they went below at dinner time he pointed out on the corner of the
dock a great stack of wooden boxes

   those are mine he said  they contain iron and steel implements
for the natives and arabs

   they look like rifle cases guy remarked carelessly and looking at
the portuguese as he spoke he fancied that the dark face actually turned
gray for an instant in a moment they were seated at the table and the brief
occurrence was forgotten

   all that afternoon they steamed on across the gulf overhead the blue
and cloudless sky beneath them waters of even deeper blue and at sunset
the yellow coast line of the african continent loomed up from the purple
distance

   guy had been dozing under an awning most of the afternoon but now
he came forward eagerly to get his first glimpse of eastern africa

   to his great disappointment the captain refused to land

   it was risky he said to make a landing at night and it would be dark
when they entered the harbor they must lie at anchor till morning

   most of the night guy paced up and down the deck sleeping at brief
intervals and listening with eager curiosity to the strange sounds that
floated out  the air from the shore where the flickering glare of many
torches could be seen

   stretched on a mattress the portuguese slept like a log without once
awakening

   before dawn the anchors were lifted and at the captains suggestion guy


the river of darkness

hastened down to his cabin to gather up his scanty luggage for most of his
traps had gone on to calcutta in the cleopatra

   he buckled on his sword put his revolvers in his pocket clapped his big
solar topee on his head and then reached down for the morocco traveling
case which he had stored away for better security under his berth

   a cry of horror burst from his lips as he dragged it out the lock was
broken and the sides were flapping apart for one brief second he stared at
it like a madman and then with frantic haste he fell  his knees and
plunging his hands inside began to toss the contents recklessly out upon the
floor toilet articles linen cigars writing paper jewelry and various
other things piled up until his finger nails scraped the bottom he turned
the case bottom up and shook it savagely shook it until the silver clasps
rattled against the sides and then he sank back with a groan while the
drops of perspiration chased each other down his haggard cheeks

   the precious despatches were gone

   for the time being guy was fairly driven out of his senses by the horror
of the calamity ruin stared him in the face what madness it was to
leave those papers in his cabin  he had foolishly hesitated to carry them on
his person for fear the perspiration would soak them through and through
aud now they were hopelessly lost the cabin door had been locked too
the thief must have had a key

    the first shock over his manliness asserted itself and he took a critical
view of the situation he hardly suspected any person as yet the des-
patches must be recovered that was the first step

   he flew up the stairs three at a time and rushed panting and breathless
upon deck

   all about him was the hurry and bustle of preparation the shore was
close at hand and the steamer was moving toward the rude wharf manuel
torres was leaning over the rail coolly smoking a cigar the captain stood
near by gazing intently at the shore he looked np with wouder as guy
appeared crying out in hoarse tones 

   i have been robbed captain treacherously robbed documents of the
greatest importance have been stolen from my cabin and not a soul shall
leave this steamer till every inch of it has been searched i demand your
assistance sir  

chapter ii-a strange meeting

   torres looked up in apparent surprise from his cigar aud the captains
ruddy face flashed a shade deeper

     are you sure sir   he cried  this is a strange place for a robbery

   guy turned on him hotly

      a robbery has been committed nevertheless and the articles stolen are
despatches for the governor of zaila they were intrusted to me for deliv-
ery and i look to you to recover them

   ah government despatches were they said the captain just
step below and well look into the matter
the river of darkness



   they turned toward the cabin leaving the portuguese still gazing over
the rail

   at the foot of the steps the captain stopped 

   why whats this he said stooping down and pulling from under
the lowest step a bunch of papers

   the stolen despatches cried guy wildly  but look  the seals
have been broken

   together they inspected the documents each envelope had been opened
but the contents appeared to be all right the thief had plainly been satis-
fied with their perusal

    whoever stole them said the captain  was afraid to retain them lest a
search should be made and as he had no way to destroy them he tossed them
down here where they could easily be found  

    who else had a key to my cabin  guy asked sternly

    the key to torres cabin will open yours replied the captain and
several of the crew also have keys  

    then torres is the man said guy  the scoundrel looks capable of
anything 

    i wouldnt advise you to accuse him said the captain gravely  he
may cause trouble for you on shore you must remember that british influ-
ence is little felt at berbera your best plan is to say nothing but relate
the whole affair to the governor at zaila and now as we may lie in the
harbor here all day you had better go on shore you will see a strange
sight  

   guy put the recovered documents away in an inner pocket and followed
the captain on deck in a very angry frame of mind torres had disappeared
but guy felt that he had not seen the last of him

   he half forgot his anger in the strange sight that now met his eyes for
the steamer waj just approaching the wharf and in a moment the gangplank
was dropped over the side

   he waited until the eager jostling crowd of arabs had passed over and
then he made his way to shore the spectacle before him was marvelous
and entrancing

   extending apparently for miles up and down the yellow stretch of sand
that fringed the coast was one great sea of canvas that fluttered under the
african breeze

   there were tents of every description some old and dingy some spot-
lessly white and shining and others brilliant in many colors barred with red
and green and yellow while here and there from their midst rose the sun
baked walls and towers of the original berbera for all this floating canvas
belonged to the nomadic population who flock hither from the interior during
the fair and add twenty thousand to the perennial population of the town

   dazed as though in a dream guy moved forward noting with wonder
the strange people who thronged about him and regarded him with evident
mistrust borne on by the crowd he found himself presently in the main
avenue of the fair and his first amazed impression was that he had been tran-
sported to a scene in the  arabian nights
o

the river of darkness

   on either side of the narrow street stretched the sea of te nts and before
them on rude stalls were ranged everything that the imagination could de-
vise sacks of coffee and grain great heaps of glittering ivory packets of
gold dust aromatic spices and fragrant gums of all sorts great bunches of
waving ostrich plumes bales of cotton and tobacco tanned h ides of domestic
animals tawny skins of lions leopards and panthers oddly woven grass
mats quaint arms and bits of carving fetish ornaments and even live cattle
and sheep tied to the poles of the tents

   standing guard over their wares were natives from all parts of africa
arabs from the zambesi savage looking abyssinians crafty somalis with
greasy dangling locks and brawny half naked fellows from the interior the
like of whom guy had never seen or heard

   and up and down the narrow street moved in a ceaseless throng the
traders who had come to purchase  arabs from aden and suakim egyp-
tians from cairo traders from zanzibar and a sprinkling of portuguese and
spaniards

   some of them bore their goods on camels others had hired native carriers
who staggered under the heavy bales and cases and the uproar was deafen-
ing and incessant as they wrangled over their bartering and dazzled the eyes
of their customers with rolls of english and french silks pigs of iron cop-
per and brass sacks of rice and sugar glittering manchester cutlery amer-
ican beads and cans of gunpowder

   the builders of the tower of babel itself could not have produced such a
jargon or variety of tongues guy thought as he picked his way onward now
stopping to gaze at some odd looking group and now attracted by the harsh
music and beating drums of a band of native musicians

   he noted with secret satisfaction the occasional presence in the crowd of
a dark skinned soldier in british uniform and he observed with some sur-
prise the vast number of abyssinian arabs whom he recognized by their
peculiar dress

   finally a stranger sight than all arrested his steps in a small inclosure
cordoned off by a rope lay a dozen poor slaves shackled to stakes driven deep
in the ground and exposed to the burning sun

   their owner a brawny negro with a head dress of feathers a native of the
galla country was disputing over their purchase with a gigantic arab whose
powerful frame irresistibly fascinated guys attention

   he wore a loosely flapping cotton gown confined at the waist by a belt
that fairly bristled with knives and pistols while a scarlet burnous was drawn
over his head affording a brilliant set off to the glittering eyes the tawny
shining skin and the short chin beard and mustache

   behind the group of slaves chained to the pole of a spacious tent lay a
sleek and glossy leopard sleeping in the sun as unconcernedly as though he
were in the midst of his native desert the arab unaware probably of the
beasts presence walked slowly round the circle inspecting his prospective
purchase

   the leopard perhaps was dreaming of the days when he was wont to chase
the deer through the jungle for suddenly his spotted body quivered and his
the river of darkness



long tail shot out like a stiffened serpent the arabs sandaled foot came
down on the tapering end and with a scream of rage the beast sprang up

   overcome by a sudden fright the arab staggered backward a pace and
like a flash the leopard shot to the end of his chain and fastening teeth and
claws  the unfortunate mans neck bore him to the ground panic stricken
those who stood near made no move the big negro danced wildly up and
down keeping well out of reach of his savage pet and the slaves howled with
fright

   an instants delay and the man was lost suddenly guy drew his revolver
and sprang forward

   the negro uttered a howl and tried topush him back but guy forced his
way past him and pressing the revolver close to the brutes head pulled the
trigger

   it was a good shot the leopard rolled over lifeless and the arab with
guys assistance rose to his feet very dazed while the blood dripped down
from his lacerated back

   instantly the scene changed the negro angered at the death of his
leopard advanced menacingly on guy with a drawn knife and in response to
his summons other negroes rallied to his aid

   but the arab too had friends in the crowd and they pressing forward in
turn made it seem as though a bloody conflict was inevitable

   just as the issue was trembling in the balance a shout arose from the
crowded street

    the white man  make room for the white man   and through the
parted ranks guy saw advancing a bronzed englishman in white flannels and
helmet

   the stranger pushed right in through the sullen group of negroes
until he reached the open space before the tent and stood face to face
with guy

   their eyes met in one amazed glance that startled the wondering specta-
tors and then from guys lips burst a glad hoarse cry 

    melton forbes or i am dreaming  

    chutney by jove  my dear fellow can it be possible 

   all else forgotten in their deep joy of meeting the two bronzed english-
men fell into each others arms and the arabs and negroes dimly compre-
hending what it all meant shouted in sympathy and lowered their arms

chapter iii-the arabs warning

      

   for a little while the british officer and the british newspaper corre-
spondent could do nothing but stand off to look at each other and then
embrace again as though it were hard to believe that it was not all a
dream

   the arabs snd negroes had drawn to one side and the big savage was
wrathfully inspecting the body of the leopard

    come said melton plucking guys arm  we will find a quiet place
where we can talk in peace


the river of darkness

   the crowd made way for them but before they had taken half a dozeu
steps the big arab staggered forward and seized guy by the hand

    you brave man he cried  makar never forget

    he kept on with many protestations of gratitude until guy tried to with-
draw in embarrassment

    wait said the arab  come along me tell you something

    he fairly dragged guy back to the entrance to the tent where none could
hear and bending low he whispered in his ear 

     berbera no place for inglis man this day better go way quick
heed what makar tell you now go

   he fairly pushed guy from him and the latter joining melton who had
witnessed the scene with the greatest curiosity led the way out into the
street

   a curious crowd followed them closely for some distance and not a word
was spoken until they had turned off into a side avenue lined with low mud
buildings

     now said melton quickly  i need not tell you my dear fellow what
a pleasant surprise this meeting has been but all explanation must be de-
ferred to a more suitable time you have made a friend and an enemy today
for makar makalo is the most powerful arab in the whole somali country
while that big negro is oko sain the head chief of all the gallas who dwell
two hundred miles back from the coast what did makar tell you
guy repeated the arabs warning and melton stood for a moment in deep
thought

     i suspected as much he said finally  never before have there been
so many arabs and somalis from the interior at berbera only yesterday a
caravan of two thousand camels arrived from harar in the galla country
something is wrong i have felt certain and now makar confirms my fears
a glimmering suspicion of the truth flashed over guys mind at this
juncture but he hesitated to speak

    now then continued melton  this can mean nothing but a massacre
the only soldiers in the place are about sixty of the bombay infantry who
were sent down here from zaila and as for the fortifications they are nothing
but a few mud walls there they lie yonder andhe pointed to an bnglish
flag fluttering over the house tops some distance away

     we are only wasting time here he added  well look about a little
and then ill decide what to do i dont want to raise any false alarm

   they turned back to the main avenue the crowds still surged up and
down and the tumult seemed as harsh and discordant as ever but the place
had nevertheless undergone a change since they had left it a short time
before little bartering was going on and but few arabs and somalis were
to be seen those on the street were mostly harmless traders from aden
and cairo

      what has become of all the arabs    asked guy

     that is just what i want to know said melton   ill soon find out
though walk as fast as you can now chutney aud look as unconcerned
as possible  
the river of darkness



   melton led the way down the street for a little distance and turning into
a side passage soon stopped before a low one story building

   a dard skinned fellow clad in ordinary egyptian costume stood in the
doorway and with a cry of surprise guy recognized mombagolo forbes
trusty savage servant who did much good service for them when they were
in burma together

   their greeting was brief and hasty

    i have work for you momba said melton something is going on
in the town i dont know just what you can go anywhere without being
suspected find out what you can and then come down to the wharf
dont return here

   the man hastened away at once and then guy and melton started for
the shore

   i wont give any alarm at the garrison said forbes as they hurried
along  ill wait till momba reports i dont suppose anything is contem-
plated before nightfall at the earliest and as the troops are scattered it would
only precipitate matters if i should have them called in

   the last bale of goods was being unloaded from the steamer when they
reached the wharf the captain and officers were smoking cigars against the
rail and catching sight of guy the former called out 

    dont forget now six oclock sharp

   guy nodded and followed melton to one side where the two sat down
on a bale of cotton melton briefly explained how he came to be at berbera
after his return from burma he had been despatched as war correspondent
of the eon don post to suakim which town was at that time threatened by
the mahdi

   mombagolo or momba as melton now called him had become his faithful
servant and a week ago the war scare at suakim having subsided melton
had come to berbera to write up the great fair for his paper

   then guy iu his turn simply stated that he had stopped off on his way
to india to execute a commission at zaila he made  reference to the
despatches feeling doubtful whether it would be proper or not for a govern-
ment secret is a thing of weighty importance

   the conversation drifted to their perilous adventures in burma and the
time passed on unheeded

   at last melton glanced up

    do you observe how quiet it is   he exclaimed  and look  there
are but few people in sight  

   it was indeed quiet a dead oppressive calm had settled on the sea  not
a breeze rustled not a ripple broke the glassy surface of the water and from
the town instead of the loud babel of cries came only a low murmur like a
distant waterfall a strange calm indeed the calm that serves as precursor
to the unseen storm

   suddenly with startling abruptness a rifle shot broke the silence with its
shuddering echoes guy and melton sprang to their feet the officers on
the steamer crowded to the rail up iu the town dark figures ran to and fro a
soldier in bright uniform was seen speeding toward the garrison and now


the river of darkness

plunging madly toward the wharf came a white clad figure pursued by a
howling group of somali warriors who brandished long spears and daggers
a shot from meltons pistol brought them to a sudden halt and momba for
it was indeed he ran a few paces and fell breathless at his masters feet

      what fiendishness is this    shouted the captain furiously from the
deck of the steamer

   momba staggered to his knees

     the arabs   he cried   they are coming-they have rifles-the
portuguese-he broke open long boxes-and handed out guns-makars men
all have them-the somalis have them-they have plenty shells-

   guy ground his teeth

     the infernal scoundrel   he cried  so thats what those long boxes
of his contained 

    you mean torres  exclaimed melton  i know the villain pie is
a partner of makar makalos but come we must fight our way to the
garrison  

   alas  too late  bang-bang-bang bang-bang a fusillade of rifle fire
rang out from the town hideous yells of triumph mingled with cries of des-
pair and agony and over the garrison walls floated a constantly increasing
cloud of white smoke the firing deepened and a hoarse yell arose as the
english flag shot from its staff fluttered down into the curling smoke

    they are murdering the garrison   cried melton

   he grasped a revolver in each hand and would have gone madly forward
but at that moment a louder tumult burst forth close at hand and swarming
down the crooked street curving in and out through the tents and heaped
up stalls came a fierce and frantic horde of arabs and somalis waving rifles
and spears and yelling like ten thousand fiends

     on board for your lives  shouted the captain and as guy and melton
dashed over the gangplank followed by momba a kick from the captain
sent it whirling down into the water

   providentially steam was up slowly the engines started the screw
revolved and just as the steamer moved slowly out into the harbor the en-
raged mob swept to the very edge of the wharf in futile rage they let fly
showers of spears and a scattering rifle fire that pierced and shattered the
wood work of the vessel but fortunately without effect for every man had
got safely below

chapter iv-the alarm

               v	t

   thev rushed up on deck again as soon as the steamer was beyond rifle
shot a distant roar like the blended shouts of thousands of people floated
across the water from the town and at intervals a shot was fired

   smoke no longer hovered over the garrison the last man had succumbed
and with the fall of the garrison the massacre seemed to have come to an
end the uprising had been directed against the british troops alone

     this is a terrible thing said melton and there is something back of
it all i cant understand it can it be possible the wretches have designs
the river of darkness



on zaila i wonder its a pity you interfered with that leopard chutney
if malcar makalo had perished this revolt might never have broken out
makar is at the head of it i know and possibly he has influence behind him
he is an ally of that fanatical despot rao khan the emir of harar who
hates the english worse than poison and-

   guy started at the mention of this name

    i want to see you a minute forbes he cried excitedly  and leading
melton to one side he pulled out the despatches from his pocket and said
 you have come closer to the truth than you imagine i am going to con-
fide a secret to you and you can tell what had best be done these papers
were intrusted to me for delivery into the hands of sir arthur ashby at
zaila and they contain instructions bearing on the very matter you have just
mentioned the authorities at the colonial office in london told me in secret
that the emir of harar was supposed to be plotting the capture of zaila and
these despatches contain sir arthurs orders in case of that emergency

    by jove that explains it   cried melton  the emergency has come
i see it all makar had collected his arabs and somalis at berbera by the
emirs orders and they were only waiting the arrival of that villainous
portuguese with the rifles they have put the garrison at berbera out of
the way and now they will march on to zaila

    then what can be done   demanded guy  shall we proceed to zaila
or get the captain to steam direct for aden and collect all the available
troops 

   no no groaned forbes that would be useless zaila is sixty
miles up the coast we can beat the arabs and get there in time to prepare
the town for defense the garrison is wretchedly small but they will have
to hold out until assistance can come from aden  

   melton was still more astounded when guy told him of the stealing of
the despatches

    then torres knows their contents he said  and he will act accord-
ingly this is certainly a bad business chutney those papers must be
delivered to sir arthur as soon as possible though to tell the truth i fear
zaila is doomed but we are losing precious time something must be done
at once

   they called the captain aside and told him just enough to impress him
with the danger threatening zaila and he readily fell in with their plans

   twilight wds now falling and by the time darkness had settled over the
blue waters of tin gulf the steamer was plowing her way steadily northward
berbera but faintly visible in the rear by the glow of the burning torches

   hour after hour they steamed on neither guy nor melton could sleep
but sitting aft on camp stools they talked in whispers of the dread events
they had witnessed and of what might be before them

   at midnight the steamer came to a sudden stop the machinery exerted
to the highest pressure had broken in some part a delay was inevitable
the captain assured them but in a couple of hours the repairs could be made

   morning came revealing the distant yellow line of the african coast but
still the steamer lay at anchor rocked gently by the blue waters of the gulf


the river of darkness

it may be imagined with what a fever of impatience guy and melton lived
through those weary hours

   it was nearly midday when the repairs were completed and the vessel
forged ahead again for fear of fresh accidents the captain refused to crowd
on steam and when at last the turrets and brown walls of zaila came in view
it was late in the afternoon

   at a distance all seemed peaceful  the english flag was floating from
half a dozen different buildings of the town in the harbor lay three or four
arab dhows and a neat little steamer which the captain said belonged to the
governor and was used for transporting troops or despatches

   captain waller anchored close by the town and accompanied guy mel-
ton and momba on shore in a small boat so far at least all was well

   a few arabs and somalis were sitting around lazily on the sand and
troops of the bombay infantry were seen moving about the streets

    appear as unconscious as possible whispered melton  let nothing
be suspected

   a close observer might have detected traces of suppressed curiosity on the
faces of the arabs and somalis but they were evidently deceived by the
careless manner of the new arrivals for after a keen scrutiny they settled
back into lazy attitudes

   i dont like the looks of those fellows said melton  and another
thing i dont like is the presence of those arab dhows in the harbor but
look chutney there is the residency ahead of us

   they were approaching a low building of sun baked brick with venetian
awninings at the entrance and windows half a dozen sentries were on
guard and an officer came forward to meet the little party

   guy saluted

    i am the bearer of important despatches for the governor of zaila he
said   and must see him at once  

   the officer disappeared for a moment and presently came back and an-
nounced that the governor would see them they were ushered in through
a wide hall and passing half along its length they turned to the right and
found themselves in the presence of sir arthur ashby he was a very
pompous looking man of middle age with reddish mustache and long side
whiskers he was seated on an easy chair beside an ebony table opposite
him sat an english officer

   they were smoking cigars and  the table were glasses and champagne
bottles packed in ice lamps were lit for already twilight was falling

   he half rose as his visitors entered and then dropped back guy briefly
introduced himself and party and handed sir arthur the despatches ex-
plaining how the seals came to be broken but making no mention of torres

   the governor knit his brow as he read them over and then to his com-
panion he remarked lightly  all nonsense all nonsense another govern-
ment scare carrington

   i beg your pardon sir arthur said guy but i was informed in
london of the tenor of those despatches yesterday afternoon the arabs at
berbera massacred the garrison to a man and are doubtless now marching on
the river of darkness



zaila we barely escaped with our lives captain waller and mr forbes
and his servant will confirm my statement

    sir arthur sprang to his feet with a sharp cry

     what is this you tell me  he gasped  can it be true 

    guy repeated his account with all the particulars but the governor actually
seemed incredulous

     colonel carrington he cried  how many troops have we

     five companies of the bombay infantry replied the colonel in a hol-
low tone  we had six yesterday but if this account be true-

   dont delay a moment shouted sir arthur  prepare for the de-
fense colonel and see that the steamer is ready in case it comes to the
worst  

    the governors condition was now truly pitiable he was trembling with
fright

     there is indeed but little time said guy  there is danger at your
very door i see many arabs and somalis in the townj

     true true groaned sir arthur and turning over the despatches with
trembling hands he added  i am instructed to order troops from cairo
and suakim what madness  what madness  

    sir arthur continued to talk in a rambling excited way until colonel
carrington assumed control of affairs

     your steamer is here now  he said to the captain  then you must
make haste to aden and bring us what troops you can i doubt though if
we can resist a heavy attack for twrenty four hours and you gentlemen
you will return on the steamer 

     no we will remain guy and melton replied almost in one voice

    the colonel glanced at them approvingly

    you are brave men he said stop  he added suddenly you
say you left berbera at sunset last night and were delayed by an accident
were there any camels there 

     a caravan of two thousand arrived two days ago replied melton

    the colonels face paled

   then the enemy are due here now he said huskily on camels
they could traverse the sixty miles in from fifteen to twenty hours it is
already dark and he pointed out through the window

    at this sir arthur groaned aloud and tossed down three or foitr glasses
of champagne in rapid succession

     to your steamer quick  cried the colonel addressing captain waller 
and you gentlemen since you decide to throw your fate in with ours
come with me and we will inspect the fortifications and do what little we
can  

    they had risen to their feet and were giving a hasty look to their arms
when a bright flash lit up the gloom from without followed by a sharp re-
port and at the same moment from all quarters of the town rose a con-
tinuous rifle firing a violent uproar and shouting and a deep beating of
drums

    sir arthur sprang to his feet crying frantically  to the steamer to the


the river of darkness

steamer-it is our only hope but before he could take a step the outer
doors were burst open shouts were heard in the hall and then through the
curtained entrance staggered blindly an officer of infantry his uniform
torn and disheveled and blood pouring from half a dozen wounds he plunged
forward and rolled in a lifeless heap at the very feet of colonel carrington

chapter v-the night on the roof

   the tragic scene described at the close of the preceding chapter following
on the very heels of the outbreak was a fearful shock to all who saw it
and for an instant they could only stare at one another with mute frightened
faces

   colonel carrington broke the spell with drawn sword he made a
dash for the door closely followed by the rest but before they could cross
the apartment a louder burst of firing came from the very courtyard bullets
whistled through the windows and then a scuffle broke out in the hall and
angry voices were heard it was over in a moment  a cry of pain a low
groan followed by the sound of bars dropped in their sockets and then into
the room burst three hindoo soldiers grimy with blood and powder

   sahib colonel cried the foremost we are lost the arabs and
somalis have revolted hundreds of them surround the residency yonder
in the hall lies a dead somali we have barred the doors but they will
soon be in

   even as he spoke the portals shook under a succession of thunderous
blows

 the rear door cried the colonel  we may escape that way

    no no  the building is surrounded rejoined the hindoo  there is
no escape

   he was right shouts were heard on all sides the blows on the doors
redoubled and stray shots came in at the windows both front and rear

   sir arthur lay prostrate in his chair

    the roof  the roof   he groaned  we must take to the roof

    by jove hes right cried the colonel  its our last hope blowout
the lights and come on quick  

   the lamps were out in a second but a dim glare still shone into the room
from the torches outside with an effort sir arthur staggered to his feet
two of the soldiers assisted him and then in great haste they hurried through
the hall to a rear room

   the building was of one story and from this apartment a ladder led to an
open trap overhead

   sir arthur was pushed up first followed closely by the rest and just as
momba brought up the rear and dragged the ladder after him the great
residency doors gave way with a crash and a wild yell of triumph told only
too plainly that the enemy had effected an entrance

   guys quick eye observed a big flat stone lying near a precautionary
measure provided by some former governor no doubt and calling on momba
to assist him he dragged it over the trap
the river of darkness



   from below came a rush of footsteps and the sound of smashing furniture
as the arabs hurried to and fro in search of their prey

   we are safe for the present said the colonel  they cant possibly
reach us and they may not even discover where we are

   the roof comprised the whole extent of the building and was probably
thirty feet square it was surrounded by a stone parapet three feet in
height and from this parapet the little band of fugitives witnessed a scene
that none forgot to his dying day

   north and west of the residency the town seemed to be in comparative
quiet and darkness for only stray lights were to be seen at intervals but
off to the south lay the fortifications and here a sharp conflict was waging

   through the darkness of the night the flash of every shot was seen and
all along the line blazed out three continuous sheets of flame as the be-
leaguered garrison poured their fire into the attacking parties that advanced
from both sides

    they cant hold out an hour said melton  the foe are too strong
for them

   a sharp cry from captain waller turned all eyes on the harbor where the
water was illumined by twinkling lights and the flash of rifles the meaning
of this was plain the steamer had been attacked no doubt those innocent
looking dhows had been filled with armed arabs waiting for the signal and
now every escape was cut off the firing was sharp and severe for a
while and then it gave way to loud cheers

   the steamers had fallen into the hands of the enemy

    there goes the last hope said the colonel   and look even the gar-
rison has succumbed

   it was true the firing had almost entirely ceased and the few stray
shots that still rang out were drowned in the vast roar that rose from all parts
of the town

   the residency was cordoned by a surging mass of wretches intoxicated
with triumph and fresh hordes came pouring in riotous from the slaughter
of the garrison

    some cunning fiend has planned all this muttered colonel carrington
and planned it infernally well too

   the arab makar makalo is the ringleader sir said melton but
he is only acting for rao khan the emir of harar who has long desired the
port of zaila  

   a swift retribution will come replied the colonel  but it will come
too late to aid us

   no person seemed inclined to talk sir arthur sat up against the parapet
in a sort of stupor and the three hindoos were grouped on one side and
momba mutely followed his master from point to point as with guy and the
colonel he made the circuit of the housetop

and now for the first time it became evident that the presence of the fugi-
tives on the roof was known thousands of arabs and somalis surrounded
the building their dark faces plainly seen in the glare from the torches but
no hostile demonstration was made they appeared to be waiting on some-
go

the river of darkness

thing or some one it was very evident that the whole population of the
town were in revolt it was equally plain too that they had been prepared
for this uprising for it had apparently broken out in all quarters of the town
at once and the expected signal had no doubt been the approach of the arabs
from berbera for the vast number of rifles used in the fight proved conclu-
sively their arrival

   wonderful success had crowned their plans yesterday the garrison at
berbera had fallen to a man  and now zaila was in their hands and all that
remained of the british possessors was the miserable band of fugitives on the
residency roof

   with bitter feelings guj looked down on the sea of faces he was
wondering if he would ever see calcutta or england again but he had
been in worse predicaments before and hopeless as it now seemed something
might turn up to save them yet

   melton was inclined to think that the arabs were only waiting for day-
light to make their attack and yet they seemed to have no idea of abandon-
ing their position but encircled the building with a sea of torches talking
loudly and excitedly all the while

   once guy ventured to peer down over the parapet and to his surprise he
saw arab guards at the residency door sternly keeping back the crowd then
he pulled aside the stone from the trap all was dark and quiet beneath
the solution to this mystery was close at hand

   of a sudden a great hush fell on the vast crowd the tuniult died away to
a low murmur and from the outskirts came a strange sound at first low and
indistinct and then louder and more vivid like the tinkling of bells mingled
with the trampling of hoofs

   the arabs and somalis fell silently apart leaving open a wide passage
like a swath cut through a field of standing corn that led straight to the
residency doors up this triumphal avenue trotted a dozen stalwart arabs
bearing lighted torches and directly behind came a gigantic camel decorated
with gorgeous trappings and hung with strings of silver bells and on the
camels back gazing haughtily around him sat the arab makar makalo

    behold makar makalo the new ruler of zaila  cried the heralds and
from the vast crowd burst one universal shout of satisfaction

chapter vi-a fate worse than death

   at sight of the daring arab chief guy could scarcely restrain himself
he would have drawn his revolver and shot him down then and there but
colonel carrington interfered

   dont excite them he said cautiously their punishment is sure
in the end how can they defend zaila against the british gunboats that
will be sent here we have possibly a chance for our lives yet dont de-
stroy that last chance  

   the colonel plainly had strong hopes it is well enough in some cases to
fight to the very last and have your names printed in the army list as heroes
who died at their post but in this case the safety of sir arthur was plainly
the river of darkness



the important point and any concession must be made to secure this so all
idea of making a fight of it was given up short and brief would have been
the struggle for guy and melton as the three hindoos were the only ones
armed and they had but a scant supply of ammunition

   makar held a short conversation with three or four arabs and then
slipping down from his camel he walked off a little way from the residency
and shouted loudly  inglis men come down you no be killed you
prisoners of war

   the idea of makars investing this bloody outbreak with all the dignity
of legitimate warfare was ridiculous and the colonel laughed

   whats that about prisoners cried sir arthur coming eagerly for-
ward will they spare our lives i wonder let me talk to the fellow
ill try to conciliate him

   he walked pompously to the parapet and bent over perhaps the cham-
pagne he had drunk had affected his head at all events he leaned a little
too far and suddenly losing his balance toppled over and fell with a crash
plump on the heads of the two arab sentries at the door all three came to
the ground iu a heap and it was a great relief to the anxious watchers above
to see sir arthur stagger to his feet apparently unhurt

   the effect on the arabs was electric the remaining guards glanced up
apprehensively and very speedily changed their location

   as for makar he evidently believed that sir arthur had come down ex-
pressly in response to his summons for he waited for the rest to follow his
example

    bless my heart  muttered sir arthur  what a narrow escape 

   he started toward makar but two arabs laid hold of him and pulled him
down roughly to one side

   wed better go down said the colonel and raising his voice he
shouted

     do you swear to preserve our lives if we come down  

    by the shades of mohammed i swear it come down replied makar

     well have to trust to his word said the colonel  put the ladder in
position

   the ladder with one end on the ground failed to reach the top of the
parapet by four or five feet it was a ticklish business to drop down  the
upper round but one by one they accomplished it and descending to the
ground were speedily seized and relieved of everything on their persons

   perhaps makar doubted his ability to keep his word for he hurried his
prisoners into the residency away from the turbulent crowd and left them
in the hall in custody of a dozen armed arabs

   they had not been here five minutes when a commotion was heard out-
side and the shattered doors were pulled apart to admit half a dozen weary
blood stained soldiers of the garrison they were the last survivors and
they told a fearful tale of woe

    the fortifications had been attacked they said at the same time by the
population of the town on one side and on the south by a vast horde of
arabs and somalis who suddenly appeared over the sand hills mounted on


the river of darkness

camels they alone had been made prisoners all others had been shot
including the officers the port surgeon and the native assistant resident

   this sad story brought tears to the eyes of all and even sir arthur waxed
terribly iudignant and prophesied speedy retribution

   but now the guards sternly forbade conversation an hour or more
passed on during which time many persons indistinguishable in the gloom
passed in and out of the residency

   then came a summons to appear before the chief

    dont be alarmed said sir arthur reassuringly  we shall be sent
across the gulf of aden this wretch will not dare do injury to her majestys
representatives  

   sir arthurs sudden change of spirits was not shared by the rest

    nerve yourself melton whispered to guy  i have an idea of what
is coming and before guy could reply they were ushered into the very
apartment which they had left so hastily a few hours before

   it had undergone no change the lamps had been relit the wine bottles
and glasses still stood on the table and in sir arthurs chair of state sat
makar makalo very stern and dignified while around him squatted on the
rugs were four arabs of superior caste and intelligence comprising no
doubt the freshly formed cabinet of the great governor of zaila

   makar waited until his captives had ranged themselves along the wall
and then with great sangfroid he helped himself to a cigar from sir arthurs
choice box of partagas lit it and then poured off a glass of champagne which
he despatched at a gulp

   having thus proved beyond a doubt that he possessed all the chief quali-
fications of a british political resident he settled back in his chair and sur-
veyed his prisoners with lowering brow

   bless my heart ejaculated sir arthur what most amazing
impu- a sudden rap on the head from one of the guards cut short his
speech and he relapsed into indignant silence

   makar was plainly a man of iron nerve for he met calmly and even boldly
the indignant defiant glances that were turned upon him as he scanned the
row of prisoners ranged before him

   glancing toward the windows he dispersed with a wave of his hand the
dark swarm of faces peering eagerly within and then at last he deigned to
break the silence which had become so ominous

   i have promised ye your lives he said  makar never breaks his
word allah is great and it is the will of allah that zaila should belong to
the true followers of the prophet already has his will been fulfilled the
hated inglis soldiers are dead rao khan is the ruler of zaila and makar is
his servant  

   he paused and helped himself to another glass of champagne it was
evident that makar was not at heart a true follower of the prophet for the
koran strictly forbids all intoxicants

   another impressive pause followed guy glanced at melton and was
alarmed to see the dead white pallor on his face melton alone perhaps
knew what was coming on the rest the blow fell with crushing severity
a trade dollar tragedy



   have i not said that makars word is inviolate the arab resumed
leaning forward and uttering each syllable sharply and distinctly

     can makar break his pledge    and he turned to his solemn visaged
ministers

    no no no they muttered in guttural accents and solemnly shaking
their heads

   then hark ye all makar went on i have sworn on the koran
that whatsoever prisoners fell to my lot should be delivered over as slaves to
the somalis of the galla country i have spoken it is kismet at day-
break ye start for the interior

   sir arthur staggered back against the wall with a dismal groan the
hindoos fell  their knees begging piteously for mercy colonel car-
rington seemed dazed stupefied guy clinched his hands and made a desperate
effort to bear up bravely while meltons face wore the same pale hopeless
expression

   no one spoke supplications and prayers would alike be useless the
arabs stern pitiless countenance spoke plainer than words mercy was an
unknown word in his vocabulary

    spare us spare us   moaned sir arthur coming forward a pace or
two and making as though he would fall on his knees

    i have spoken cried makar harshly  words will avail ye nothing

   he made a signal to the guards who at once closed in on the wretched
captives and led them away

the entanglements precipitated upon an abettor of true love-parts played in the plot by a
jealous wife a matched team a disguised locket and a rabbit

hp here is no use in denying the fact i never mention it and julia
does not know that it exists to mention but-julia is jealous
heaven only knows why she should be i never have too much time to
devote to my own family without looking about at other mens wives and
as for young girls it is ridiculous to suppose that they even realize that there
is such a person as dick winthrop on the face of the earth

   i confess that i am forty five m hair is gray and i am growing stout

i look at the various appliances for reducing obesity as they are advertised in
the daily papers and wonder how a man has the requisite nerve to go up and
ask an impudent young string of a drug clerk for one of the things it is
unconscious working of the mind i suppose i may be getting up sufficient
momentum to go through the ordeal by the time i can no longer do without
these assistances to a respectable figure

   but julia sees none of this she has a water color portrait of myself that
was made the year we were married it shows a slim drooping shouldered
young man with his hair waved over his brow a lackadaisical expression


a trade dollar tragedy

and a low necked shirt i always feel like asking- him out of the frame and
kicking him as a consummate ass  but he is the man julia loved-loves 
and she has an odd fancy that twenty years later she is still married to him
it would seem a pity to try to undeceive her  besides you couldnt do it a
woman always fancies that the man she loved must be equally fascinating to
all her sex

   it might be flattering if it were not so ridiculous to be hedged about
with conjugal solicitude when a man comes to forty fatherhood and general
commonplaceness

   this last spring jim reynolds came down to salaville to make us a short
visit i knew perfectly well why he came mary marston was staying at
her graudfathers just across the way and she and jim were violently in
love with each other in the hot headed way of a boy and girl he is
twenty four and she is nineteen and the prettiest girl i ever saw

   the marstons and the reynoldses have not been friends since the great
law suit about the mills ten years ago and any question of a marriage be-
tween the two was not to be entertained for a single moment as long as jim
was dependent upon his father for support he was making preparations for
going into one of the mills and these two young geese dreamed dreams about
a day of love in a cottage with the usual accompaniments

   jim had confided the whole story to me it would have been more natural
for him to tell it to julia but she never had liked the lads mother whom
she called a married flirt and some of her resentment seemed to go to
jim then too the marstons were dear friends of hers and she would
certainly have felt it her duty to let a little distilled drop of warning
fall into the ears of somebody had she known that jim and mary were
engaged

   she never suspected it jim gave it out that he came down to get a prac-
tical knowledge of the workings of a factory from me and mary was on a
demure visit to her grandfather who was old and good natured and buried
in his library just across the street

   the lovers had a delightful time wandering in the fields about salaville
and exploring the roads for miles around i used to start out in the morning
taking jim in my buggy factoryward he would leave me at the gate of the
works and drive back toward town ten to one miss marston would be
strolling along the road outside of town and could be induced to take the
seat by jims side and go for a drive my kentucky mare betty b was a
famous traveler and cared nothing for dust and heat and miles  and it is my
firm conviction based upon observation and past-long past-experience that
these two young people never knew such things existed

   late at night after mary was shut up in her little white room across the
way jim would sit out on the veranda with me and while i smoked he
lifted up his voice in praise of his divinity

   one morning at breakfast julia came down a little late johnny had
been ailing the night before from a superfluity of sour cherries and my wife
had left me to my slumbers and had spent the night in the nursery as she
came in i noticed an unusual tightness about her upper lip it seemed to
a trade dollar tragedy



meet the lower one with an unusual degree of pressure and there was a
woodenness about her shoulders that was not inviting

   my dear i said soothingly i certainly think it a shame that the
gluttony of that child should give you a bad night let me insist upon his
being kept from all fruit  

     if he is at all like the rest of mankind that will only make a sneak of
him said my wife icily

   neither of us seined to know exactly where it came in but we felt a
breeze somewhere and jim rushed into the conversation in an effort to close
the gap

     we didnt get to bed until late either mr winthrop and i sat out on
the steps talking until almost midnight

     i heard you said my wife laconically

    jim gave me a frightened look and regardless of consequences i dashed
into the breach

    we were talking about miss marston across the way i said i knew
she had heard that name but i also knew that we were generally speaking
too low and especially upon important points for the full conversation to
reach the nursery windows  i was telling jim what a very beautiful young
girl she was

    it seems to me said my usually well bred wife  that a man with a
child suffering from cholera morbus might have found something better to do
than discuss a young woman

    indeed my dear said i  had i known you were going to have such
a trying night i should have come in to stay with the boy myself at least
part of the night  

      after you were through extolling miss marston i suppose  

   i said no more when a woman is tired and unreasonably cross there is
no remedy

   jim didnt have his drive that morning but three hours later we saw
mary out walking with a cub of a boy about twelve years old and in the
noon mail there came a note saying that her young brother cecil had come
down to stay for a week and he would be certain to see and report every-
thing she did accompanying the note was a little square box containing
a silver trade dollar a slip of paper was across it  press on the e in the
word  states 

   jim brought it to me just as it was and then he took it out and looked
it over it looked exactly like a trade dollar and indeed that is what it was 
but its lightness to one accustomed to handling coin would have shown that
there was something unusual about it

    jim put the tip of his thumbnail upon the e and the side lifted itself
discovering a tiny miniature of mary marston it was almost as lovely as
she was-innocent and sweet with tender trusting blue eyes  it gave one a
pleasant feeling about the heart bright eager and beautiful i made up
my mind again that she was exactly the wife for a good honest young fellow
like jim and that i would indulge myself in the pleasure of furthering their
little romance to the best of my ability it isnt so often in these days that


a trade dollar tragedy

you see a perfectly suitable match being thwarted by a feud it harks back
to the days of romance

   i lamented that julia would not be in the secret she has a tender heart
and would have enjoyed it

   jim was almost reconciled to a weeks separation as he looked at the pic-
ture this was something that he could have hourly i think that for the
first day or two he hunted up the secluded spots where he and mary had
strolled and assured each other of undying affectionand sat down under a
tree and gazed at the face of his sweetheart all day long his trousers bore
that appearance when he came home to dinner and his ravenous appetite
made one wonder as to his lunch

   johnny recovered from his cholera but two days later aunt sarah aud
uncle john came for a night and brought two young girls with them julia
slept in the nursery and i turned in with jim

   in the middle of the night there was a peremptory ring at the door and a
messenger boy stood there with a telegram for jim telling him that his father
had been seriously injured by a fall from his horse there were just twelve
minutes in which to catch the train and we got him off

   as i drove out of the gate the next morning i missed the bright young
fellow who usually sat beside me and made up my mind that i would
find a salary for him in my own factory and keep him until his father
relented there would be hundreds of thousands under his control sooner
or later

   just as i passed my gate i saw my young son aged six and cecil marston
interestedly examining a silver dollar

    its a trade dollar  cecil was saying aud aint worth so much as a
real one but you can have the rabbit for it there aint anything mean
about me

   i felt like stopping johnny to ask him where he got his dollar trade or
otherwise and then i remembered that he had one or two trade dollars in his
bank it was against the rules for him to spend his bank money but his
mother attended to the discipline of the family and i had a sneaking dislike
to getting johnny into a scrape  besides there was a directors meeting in
my office that morning and betty b had already carried me far down the
shady village street

   at the factor i found a telegram from jim on my table

  left dollar under pillow send	jim

   as soon as i could get away from that meeting i sent betty speeding home
i couldnt have jims picture of mary marston lying about loose yet how in
the mischief was i going to find it 

   i had intended going in the back way where i should usually have en-
countered alice the maid who arranged the bedrooms but instead julia came
out to the porte cochire to meet me

    dick she said  there was a man here this morning who says he has a
perfect match for betty b he saw her somewhere the other day and asked
whose horse she was and he says hell buy her or sell you his horse if he
can arrange it now heres just the opportunity you know you told me
a trade dollar tragedy



that when you could find a match for betty i might have them for carriage
horses  

    i was anxious to find a match for betty b and the chance of it put every-
thing else out of my head i told julia to ask the man to bring the horse-
he had said that he would call the next day-and if it was all right we would
buy it

   the next morning i asked alice if she had found a coin under my pillow
the morning after mr reynolds went away she was an honest and pretty
country girl and the color of deepest embarrassment went all over her face
she said yes and went hastily out of the room coming back presently with
a new silver dollar i discovered in an instant that she supposed it had been
left there as a tip and i had another in my hand to give her

    but this is not the one i said  the one i want was valuable as a
-rare coin it was a trade dollar

   just then julia came in at the window she had been standing out on
the balcony watering her nasturtiums

    what is it  she asked looking at alice

   the girl was almost in tears and i wanted to get away as speedily as
possible

    only that jim left a tip for alice and by mistake i gave her a pocket
piece a trade dollar and i wanted to get it back again

   julia didnt approve of tipping the servants and she was annoyed at
once

    that trade dollar  i think alice let me have it in some change

   cold chills went over me what an idiot i had been to claim that coin
as my own  she would certainly discover that it was not a genuine piece of
money and then what explanation was i to make 

    it was under his pillow alice began not seeing that she was exoner-
ated

   julia looked a bit contemptuous i knew she was thinking that it was
very vulgar for a gentleman to leave tips for female servants under his
pillow

    come to think said julia  i gave that dollar to johnny at once he
said he knew a boy who had a rabbit he could buy for a dollar

   cecil marston  i must write a note to mary explain the circumstances
and have her get the coin back from her beggarly little brother i was glad
it had gone as it had at any rate it had left my hands and i had by my
general stupidity just escaped a mess i sat down at my desk and wrote the
note it was as polite and formal as possible merely explaining the circum-
stances after it was finished i called mike the gardener to come and carry
it and then i changed my mind i had barely escaped one scrape i
wouldnt put myself anywhere near another there was a messenger boy at
the salaville office i would send him he was a stupid looking loutish
boy who was just going out as i went in but they told me he would be
back and my note would go in an hour

   then i went to the factory with a clear conscience-my whole duty
done


a trade dollar tragedy

    i had been at the factory office two or three hours when there was a jang-
ling ring at ray telephone and julias voice at a pitch i seldom heard bade
me very peremptorily to come home

    i am fond of my children and my first thought was of johnnys daring
attempts at gymnastics or the baby-little dolly-of whom i am fonder than
anybody on earth i asked at once what the matter was but the connection
had been rung off julia must have been excited

    i put betty b through her best paces and she fairly spun me over the
three miles to the house as i came up the drive i saw the cause of julias
anxiety standing at the door it was the replica of betty b a more per-
fect match i never saw in my life an impulse of thankfulness took with it
the first annoyance at having been put through twenty minutes of keen
anxiety so unnecessarily

    i looked over the two animals and made up my mind that julia should
have her carriage horses if the man would take anything like a reasonable
price for betty bs twin and then went leisurely into the house

    i found julia in the parlor alone fairly quivering with excitement of some
sort

     they are a match i began- but what is the matter rcy dear 
will you be good enough to tell me she said with what young
woman you have been driving about the country the past two weeks   

    young woman t  i said stupidly driving about the country with
a young woman julia are you crazy i never drove about the country
with a young woman iu my life

thank you  i may not have been as young as mary marston when i

was fool enough to marry you but i- 

    julia i said in heavens name what are you talking about you
know i havent been driving with anybody ive been at the factory these
two weeks as you know perfectly well  

    and then a dreadful suspicion struck me it had been very hot weather 
could it be possible that there was anything wrong with my wifes reason 

     arent you well julia   i asked

   well i am perfectly well thank you with tremendous sarcasm
 but i should like to have you explain how the man who ow ns that horse
out there came to know it would match betty b you may tell me untruths
day after day and i may be stupid enough to believe you but there is such
a thing as circumstantial evidence this man says that he has seen you pass
his place seven miles in the country with a young lady who he says lie
thought was your-wife

     hes a liar   said i

     he sees you so often that he comes to know every point of the horse
and brings an exact match for her in here   there was triumph and bitter-
ness in julias tones she was too angry for the triumph not to be on top

he says the lady wore a black hat with red flowers and a white gown i
have seen mary marston go down the street every morning immediately
after you left and now i know where she has gone i am going home to
my mother   and there was a prelude to hysterics given out on the air
a trade dollar tragedy



   oh jim  i was just on the point of giving him up-for no young fellow
has a right to get a married man into such a scrape as this-when the door
opened and julias younger sister maude came in

   maude is a cool and cynical young woman very much end of the century
i couldnt tell jims love affair to her i could prove in course of time that i
was not the man who had been driving mary marston about the country in a
conspicuous costume i put my hands in my pockets and settled back with
an air of virtuous innocence

     whats the matter here  you and dick having a shindy  what on earth
is wrong have yu kissed the cook dick  wont you let her have a new
parlor carpet

   oh  i said with great calmness ive been riding about the
country with mary marston and julias objecting 

   well ill congratulate you on your good taste you couldnt find a
prefer girl im sure if i were a man i couldnt live opposite mary for two
weeks and not ask her to go driving but i didnt think you had the brisk-
ness to do it  

    oh you may joke poor julia said but i saw there was a glimmer of
hope that it was a joke

   our house is an old fashioned one with windows opening to the ground
julia turned towards one of them mopping her eyes and at that instant that
infernal messenger boy stepped on the lawn directly in front of her and held
out a note

    miss marston said for me to give this to mr winthrop and will you
sign it  

   julia took the note and turned around perfectly pallid holding in her
hand a tiny square of palest azure the conventional young ladys note

   i got up and held out my hand for it maude looked at us both and gave
a low and expressive whistle

   no said julia  and she tore the letter open

   it had grown to deadly earnest now i should have to tell on jim the
note would do it if i did not

    if i must tell you i began-

     maude listen to this 

my dear mr winthrop

      thank you so much for the warning  i have something delightful to tell you and
will try to see you during the morning i see betty b has a match i could not enjoy
two more than i have the one

                                            yours so truly

mary marston

   maude reached out her hand for the note

    well dick my boy you have been going it rather you ought to have
her educated past sending notes to the house i cant really blame julia
this time i think youre rather a brute and she looked at me with mild
contempt

   there were no tears for julia now she had risen in the might and dig-
nity of her womanhood she was showing at last the real fine grain that i


a trade dollar tragedy

loved in her when it comes to a supreme moment i pi-y that man who
does not admire his wife she may have all the small faults that may cause
him to writhe but the unpardonable sin is commonplaceness

    i walked over to her

    julia i said this is all a mistake it is something that i ought to
have told you long ago but i promised-

    there was a stamp of angry feet on the piazza aud a rush and a sobbing
howl then johnny threw himself at his mother something clutched tight
in his hand which he pressed into his mothers

    cis marston says this aint a good dollar he says they wont take
it at the store hes brought it back and says hes goin to take the rabbit 

   julia was perfectly calm and collected by this time she looked at the
coin and held it out almost gently

     is it your pocket piece-your trade dollar 

   maude gave a real laugh

    his pocket piece oh julia thats a locket ive seen those things
before the plot thickens press on the e in the word  states julia lets
see the fun out  

    julia i cried  before you touch that thing i demand that you listen
to me i would have told you before had not maude been sitting here
that imperturbable young woman merely smiled up in my face  it was
not i who was out riding with mary marston but some one else to whom i
lent my horse

     press on the e in the word  states julia said maude

    it was found under your pillow however julia said her finger hunt-
ing the spring

     you shall not open it until you hear me  

    i sprang for it aud the thin silver lid flew up showing mary marstons
pretty face

    maude was leaning over julias shoulder and she looked up at me

    sometimes in this world just about as often as a man gets all the trumps
on a whist deal the opportunely saving event arrives precisely on the mo-
ment the disaster can always come it never seems to require any com-
plicated machinery but the delicate mechanism of a deliverance almost
always fails to work it looks like special providence when it does come

   there was a rush in at the window and jim rejnolds young and ra-
diant with his arm actually about mary marstons waist swept her into the
room

    congratulate us  the row is over   jim simply shouted  the gov-
ernors are as thick as thieves again and were going to get married next
month  

   mary was laughing but a little shy her eye lighted upon her picture
in julias hand and she seized upon it as something diverting

     oh you have found it have you  i havent been able to catch that boy
cecil all morning i am simply furious with jim for leaving it about as tips
for maids

                                                            phillips mcclure
the bunkel mystery

how the robbery of the rival banks became a matter of strange coincidences-far reaching
and totally unexpected results of an act of gallantry-the battles on bunkel
island and the frustrating of carefully laid plans

synopsis of chapters previously published

    mr singerlayand mr barkpool are the two wealthiest citizens of montoban the former
is proprietor of the montoban mill and president of the montoban bank  the latter owns the
onongo mill and presides over the onongo bank they have long been enemies and their
quarrel is shared by their sons dolph singerlay and pliin barkpool but both the latter are beset
by the same desire  to have a steamer of his own on the lake andy lamb is the son of mr
barkpools engineer and he rescues diana singerlay from the persecutions of tom sawder a
young hoodlum he sails her boat to the singerlay home for her and in passing through the
grounds of the rival magnate afterwards he overhears that gentleman in altercation with his son
not caring to be seen as though he were trespassing when the owner of the property is in this
mood andy steps behind a tree where he is perforce a listener to the high words dolph is
pleading with his father to buy him a steamer and on the magnate declaring that the other
would not know how to manage the engine dolph replies that he can get andy lamb to do it
whereupon mr singerlay exclaims 

     do you think i would trust my son in the hands of one of barkpools satellites  

    at this inopportune moment andy sneezes violently is discovered by mr singerlay and
dragged by him into the house

chapter viii-a quarrel between father and son

 v ndy lamb was not a little astonished at this warm reception on his
 first visit to the residence of mr singerlay he now saw that he had
made a mistake in concealing himself though he had only stepped behind the
tree to allow the magnate and his son to pass

   the prisoner felt capable of making a very respectable resistance to the
operations of the magnate  but after his pleasant relations with the daugh-
ter he did not feel like fighting with the father besides his captor did not
hurt him  he had only taken him by the collar and as long as he did not
resist he was not damaged in the slightest degree

   besides he was sure that as soon as di told the story of the adventure on
the lake the scale would be turned and he was even tempted to believe that
he might be treated with consideration he was not too modest to believe that
he had rendered an important service to the daughter

ive got the rascal that has been stealing the strawberries   exclaimed
mr singerlay when he stopped at the side door of the mansion to take the
latch key from his pocket  go and see if you can find a policeman dolph 
 why thats andy lamb   ejaculated the son who for the first time
saw the prisoners face when his father halted

 	the first  chapters of this story appeared in the april issue of the argosv which
will be mailed to any address on receipt of  cents


the bunkel mystery

    i dont care who he is he has been stealing the strawberries replied
the father

     i have not touched your strawberries mr singerlay  and i did not even
know that you had any andy ventured to say in the mildest of tones

     do you think a man would have a place like mine without having straw-
berries on it   demanded the magnate  and the remark seemed to be a new
grievance to him

    i meant only to say that i have no personal knowledge of your straw-
berry bed added andy

    what are you doing on my grounds then   demanded the owner of the
montoban mill

    landed from a boat and was on my way home  

   mr singerlay opened the side door and conducted his prisoner to his
office which was a large apartment where he sometimes attenced to the varied
details of his business as soon as they were in the room he released andy
and proceeded to look him in the face as though he intended to overawe him
and thus bring out the signs of his guilt

   andy did not overawe worth a cent he had done nothing wrong and
he held up his head like a man the magnate looked at his face and exam-
ined his hands  but he could not find a single red stain upon him dolph
appeared to have his reasons for conciliating the prisoner and he spoke in
his favor

    whether you stole my strawberries or not you are a trespasser on my
grounds and if ever i catch you on my property again i will prosecute you
continued mr singerlay you can go now

   andys self respect did not permit him to make any reply to this unpleas-
ant speech and he left the office he was not even tempted to change the
current which had set against him by alluding to the event on the lake for
he felt that he had been very shabbily treated the office opened into an
entry on one side of which was the door leading out of the house

   when he came to the door he found he could not open it he was a
machinist by nature and while he was looking to see why he could not get
out the father and son in the office resumed the conversation which had been
interrupted by andys unfortunate sneeze the involuntary visitor had no
intention of listening to it but he could not open the door

    i must have the money father said dolph very decidedly

    not a dollar for a steamer   exclaimed the magnate in the most un-
compromising tone

    i have got a big idea in my head father persisted dolph  i mean
business  

    nonsense  there is no more business in your head than in a sick
mules added the father though he now seemed to be in bet er humor than
he had been a moment before

    in a dry time you run the mill at a loss because it costs so much to haul
coal over the hills persisted the son  with a steamer on the lake and two
or three barges- 

    andy did not think it was the right thing for him to play the listener and
the bunkel mystery



he returned as far as the door of the office he had satisfied himself that the
outside door was locked and that the key had been taken away

    i told you to go you young rascal  cried the magnate when he saw
the visitor at the door

   the door is locked and i cannot get out answered andy humbly
enough

   mr singerlay did not explain the matter but he had locked the door
when lie came in and put the key in his pocket for he thought his prisoner
might try to escape he had forgotten it now without any explanation
he unlocked the door and permitted andy to retire

   i dont want to hear another word about a steamer dolph said mr
singerlay as he returned to the office  i am sure you would get blown up
if you had one and your mother would worry all the time about you

   you seem to think i am a baby father but i am not i am sixteen
year old and that was the age of charles xii when he took command of the
army of sweden replied dolph throwing back his head as though he felt
that he was somebody

    all right dolph the first but could charles xii run a steamer that
is the question before us now if you want to take charge of an army i
have no objection only i shall not find the army chuckled the magnate
who sometimes tried to be funny

   you neednt make game of me governor i am going to have the
steamer whether or no  if you dont give me the money i shall get it in
some other way growled the hopeful son who was a spoiled child for he
was looked upon by the magnate as his successor  ill let you know that
i am not a bab  

   none of your impudence dolph if you dont behave yourself ill
put you to bed without your supper so you want to go into the coal busi-
ness with your steamer   

    i was going to put you in the way of getting ahead of barkpool but i
wont say another word about it until you give me the money for the
steamer replied the sou saucily

    then you will hold your tongue until you are gray you are an impu-
dent puppy  before i give you a steamer or anything else i shall teach you
better manners to your father replied mr singerlay angrily  you treat
me as though i were a boy like yourself

    and you treat me as though i were a baby added dolph in no better
temper than his father

    i have simply refused to give you the money to buy a steamer because
it would be a dangerous plaything in the hands of a boy  and i shall stick to
what i have said

    iu the hands of a boy   exclaimed dolph starting up from his chair
in a violent passion  i am not a baby  

    no you are not exactly a baby  as you say you are like charles xii a
boy of sixteen  

    i shall prove to you that i am a man  i am not a baby  i shall have
the steamer


the bunkel mystery

    where will you get the money to buy it  asked the injudicious parent
in a sneering tone

    ill borrow it of barkpool if i cant get it in any other way

    do you mean to insult your father demanded the magnate stung to
the quick at the hinted treason of his son

   you wont hear me when i want to talk business  and if you wont
barkpool will replied dolph bitterly as he rushed out of the house

   his father was too angry to follow him

chapter ix-a rupture with the house of barkpool

   andy lamb was glad to get out of the house of mr singerlay for he felt
that he had been abused but he was confident that the magnate would
come to his senses when he had heard dis story and he was willing to wait
for the future to set him right he had overheard a part of the quarrel be-
tween the father and son and it had given him an idea or raher revived an
old one

   dolph had an idea he had discovered and it was the same as his own
the magnates sou had spoken of a steamer on the lake and two or three
barges at that point andy had interrupted the conversation for he did not
care to have it said in the future if his idea should ever be carried out that
he had borrowed it from dolph but what he had heard showed him that it
was time for him to be at work on his idea or the other faction would get
ahead of him

   there was a great trunk line railroad about five miles south of montoban
and another twelve miles north of it running close to the shore of the lake
stages connected with the railroad trains and all the merchandise and
material had to be carted over the road no one appeared to have thought of
a connection by water with the northern railroad

   in spite of what he had heard dolph say andy was confident that no one
had considered his idea  and he had not spoken of it even to his father it
was time that something was done though dolph had failed to obtain a hear-
ing from his father on the subject

   andy thought he had better see phin barkpool when he came ashore
and he walked across the town to rockrib creek at the mouth of which the
milly phins sloop named after his sister was usually moored this creek
ran parallel to the onongo river and less than a mile from it near the
mill of mr barkpool it was less than a quarter of a mile from the river

   in order to injure the owner of the other mill as much as possible mr
barkpool had made a channel from his water wheel to rockrib creek so that
all the water used was diverted from the river and so much power was taken
from the lower privilege whether or not it was lawful for him to divert
this water was a question the courts had not yet decided this was one of
the lower magnates greatest grievances

   andy reached the mouth of the creek just as phin was mooring his boat
he seated himself on the shore to wait for him in a few minutes the skip-
per of the milly came on shore he could not help seeing his late companion
the bunkel mystery



in the boat but he resolutely looked away from him refusing to notice
him

   andy was rather astonished at this conduct  the part of phin he
realized then that he had offended him by his course in the boat though
he felt that he had done his duty in going to the assistance of di singerlay
he was willing to explain his views to his angry associate

    i say phin   called andy as the other walked away from him

   what do you want andy lamb demanded phin hardly looking
back at him

    i want to see you replied andy quickening his pace so that he was
at the side of the other in a moment  are you put out with me 

   put out with you exclaimed phin after the way you have
treated me i dont think you need to ask me such a question of course i
am put out with you and i wont have anything more to do with you

    well if that is so i dont know that i can help myself added andy
really sorry to find that the breach was so serious

    what do you expect of me if i let you sail with me i expect you to
do as i say said phin a little more pliably

   if you let me sail with you phin exclaimed andy utterly con-
founded at this cool interpretation of his presence on board of the milly
 why you asked me to go with you and show you how to sail your boat
better than you had been able to sail her before i went to oblige you
though i had something else to do  

 i suppose you will say that i went down  my knees and begged you
to go with me sneered phin

    i dont say that but you certainly asked me to go with you

     no matter if i did  i expected you to do as i said

     didnt i do as you said  

    no you didnt  i told you not to meddle with that girl  and then you
deserted me to look out for her-singerlays daughter too  

    tom sawder had taken her boat away from her and insulted her i
thought i ought to do something to save her from harm and i did it replied
andy firmly

    then you dont mean to beg my pardon for what you did  demanded
phin

     i certainly do not for i did what i thought was right and i cant apolo-
gize for it  

    all right andy lamb  if you can get along without me i think i can
get along without you said phin as he resumed his walk

    i dont want to have any ill feeling about it phin added andy

     then beg my pardon for deserting me and going over to the enemy   
said phin stopping again

    i cannot do that for i am guilty of no wrong

    then dont come near me again  

   andy stopped where he was unwilling to humiliate himself to any greater
extent he stood in the road watching the retreating form of his late asso-
ciate for he had never regarded him as his friend phin was not so arbitrary

the bunkel mystery

and domineering as dolph though he sometimes made himself disagreeable
by his assumption he seemed to be always conscious that he was  the son
of his father  

   instead of obtaining an interview with mr barkpool through his son as
he had decided to do in order to explain his plan of transportation andy
found himself at swords points with both of the magnates but he was on
the best of terms with his own father who always treated him more as a
younger brother than a son and he hastened home in order to take his
advice

   if his father told him to beg the young magnates pardon he thought he
might be able to do it but morgan lamb though he was mild and concilia-
tory in his manner had a reasonable share of self respect and independence
he had formerly been an engineer on a hudson river steamer and had left
this occupation to work at his trade as a mechanic so that lie could be with
his family more of the time

   mr lamb had been sent with others to put up the machinery in the
onongo mill and then he had been engaged as engineer and as machinist
when the engine was not in operation he lived in a cottage built for him
by his employer near the division line and half way between the two mills

   it was nearly sundown and before andy had gone half the distance to his
home he met his father who was going to the town

    what is the matter with phin barkpool andy asked mr lamb  he
would not speak to me and hardly looked at me when i passed him just now
he always used to be civil to me

   phin has fallen out with me father replied andy looking into his
fathers face to note the effect of the disclosure

    not through any fault of ours i hope my son added the machinist
stopping short in the road with astonishment he had resumed his walk
with andy at his side

     i will leave you to judge whether it is my fault or not father replied
andy  and he proceeded to relate in full detail all that had occurred on the
lake with the interview at rockrib creek

   it was a long story and when it was finished they had reached the cotfage
on their return

  chapter x-the terrible explosion in onongo river

    to people having business or labor connections with either of the magnates
a rupture was a matter of no trifling consequence as it involved the loss of
employment or trade mr lamb was duly impressed by the narrative of his -
son and he asked him a great many questions at last he was satisfied that
he fully comprehended the whole affair

    if i have done wrong father i am willing to apologize to phin though
it would go against the grain to do so said andy when he had answered
the last question

    you have not done wrong andy and you shall not make an apology
with my consent replied mr lamb as he took his sons hand and shook
the bunkel mystery



it heartily  you have done just as i should in your place and i am proud
of your conduct especially in running down that boat after tom sawder had
missed your head by only a foot with his last shot why the young villain
is a pirate and i will see that he is taken care of if no one else does it

     i was afraid he would load up his two revolvers again and fire better
the next time added andy

    but i think mr barkpool must be more reasonable than his son and
we had better go over aud see him at once continued the machinist  we
will go directly after supper and then we shall find him at home  

    on their arrival at the palatial residence of the magnate they found him
smoking his cigar in his office the machinist and his son took a respect-
ful attitude before the autocrat  but they saw that a change had come over
him for he had always treated them kindly as he treated all except when
he intended to   grind   them

    my boy has had a little difficulty with mr phineas mr lamb be-
gan in the most conciliatory manner

   your boy has behaved very badly lamb replied mr barkpool with
a frown on his brow

    i am sorry you think so sir added the machinist  perhaps you
have not got all the facts about the affair  

    do you mean to say that my son has lied to me about it demanded
the magnate rising from his chair in his wrath for it was plain enough that
he intended to be angry when the time came for a demonstration

    i didnt know but you might like to hear both sides of the question
as you have now heard one side suggested mr lamb in the mildest pos-
sible tone

    there is only one side to this question and i have heard that from
my son answered mr barkpool evidently meaning that his decision should
be final

    andy is here and perhaps you would like to ask him some questions
sir suggested the machinist

      do you want me to believe that phineas is a liar   

      if you should bring them both together very likely- 

     i will not bring them together for i will not admit that my son could
have given me false information there are only two points to be settled 
did andy desert my sou did he desert him for the purpose of going to the
assistance of that girl-i mean singerlays daughter demanded mr bark-
pool looking the machinist sharply in the face

     andy certainly left your son- 

     i say deserted him   interposed the magnate fanning the flame of his
anger

    i say that andy left your son repeated mr lamb  and his eye was
beginning to sparkle a little

    say deserted him lamb   stormed the angry mill owner

   i will not say that for he did not desert him added the workman
mildly but firmly

     i say he did desert him  


the bunkel mystery

    you can call it what you please  and i shall do the same andy did
leave your son as he had a perfect right to do

    he had no right to desert my son and it was mean and treacherous for
him to do so  and in upholding your sou you are as guilty as he is   retorted
the furious magnate

     we differ in regard to the quality of - sons action and i most heart-
ily uphold him in leaving mr pliineas under the circumstances continued
mr lamb  on the second point andy did leave phineas to go to the assist-
ance of miss singerlay  

   miss singerlay   exclaimed the mill owner in the most contemptuous
manner for it went against his grain even to hear the daughter of his rival
spoken of in respectful tones  she is singerlays daughter and that w-as
reason enough why andy should not go near her you cannot serve god
and the devil both

    that is very true sir  and for that reason i shall serve god replied
the machinist bowdng his head as though he had made a point

   mr barkpool boiled over with rage as this remark pricked him and he
darted off to the other end of the room in the effort to contain himself but
he immediately returned and placed himself in front of the workman who
had pluck enough to speak his own mind

    you cant serve singerlay and me at the same time  that is what i
mean gasped the enraged speaker

    that is what i supposed you meant  but which is god and which is the
devil   asked mr lamb as cool as a man coujd be for he had put his anger
behind him

    you are insolent lamb  

    if i am insolent what are you barkpool 

   phineas ordered andy not to leave him said the magnate when he
found that the machinist could use as strong language as he could himself

   he did and i am glad that andy had the spirit to disregard him
there was a young lady in the hands of a miscreant who took her boat away
from her and insulted her when she called for help your son was a coward
mean and contemptible that he did not heed her call said mr lamb in a
slow and emphatic manner i am proud of andy because he did not heed
phineas order and went to the assistance of the young lady in spite of him
i am thankful that he did not ask whose daughter she was and i hope when
your daughter is in danger of insult and outrage she will find a champion
who will do the same without asking who her father is

   mr lamb concluded his rather long speech and the magnate did not
immediately make any reply in fact he seemed to be overwhelmed by the
argument of the honest machinist especially in its reference to his own
child

     i see that it is no use to talk any more about this matter mr barkpool
and andy and i will retire before wre are kicked out-of the house said mr
lamb

    i discharge you from my employ and you will move out of my house at
once    growled the mill owner choking for utterance  for it had been many
the bunkel mystery	

a year since he had listened to any such plain speech applied to himself   do
you understand me lamb

   i understand you perfectly barkpool and of course i expected this
now i want you to understand barkpool that i have got a soul and that
my soul belongs to me come andy my boy shake the dust off tour feet
and let us go home

   mr barkpool was too much confounded by the boldness and plain speech
of the mechanic to say another word he was quivering with rage for he
had found that the engineer was a man and not a thing it was a new reve-
lation to him he meant to be kind and condescending to his employees
because they were his inferiors not because they were human beings like
himself

    you have lost your place father said andy as soon as they were out
of the house

     but i have not lost my manliness nor my self respect  and that is a good
deal better replied the engineer  these two mill owners think they are
a couple of gods before whom we should all bow down  and i am willing to
do so within reasonable limits but not at the sacrifice of my soul and con-
science i have got money enough to live on till i get another situation
we are all right andy do your duty as you understand it and you will
come out right in the end though you may get some hard knocks for it

   he had hardly finished the sentence before a tremendous explosion shook
the very ground on which they stood they were standing on the bank of
the river just below the upper dam in the darkness for they had taken the
path from the house to the road both of them stepped back for it seemed
as though they were going to be pitched into the stream

   for an instant the scene was lighted up and andy and his father as they
turned saw that it was the dam in which the explosion centered the struc-
ture was torn into fragments for half the width of the river on the farther
side and vast quantities of water as well as pieces of timber and planks with
stones and earth were scattered in every direction

   the upper dam had been blown up with powder or some other explosive
the pent up w aters rushed with tremendous velocity down the narrow gorge
of the stream carrying with it the wreck of the dam it was a terrible sight
and father and son gazed with awe upon it in a few minutes it was followed
by another crash down the river and mr lamb said the lower dam had been
carried away by the rush of waters he was right

chapter xi-great excitement in montoban

   the explosion must have shaken the country for miles around to mor-
gan lamb and his son who were standing on the bank of the river and but a
short distance from it it had the effect of an earthquake the flash and glare
first attracted their attention and the sudden illumination was instantly fol-
lowed by the terrific report and the shaking of the earth beneath them then
came the crash of waters and the heavy roaring which did not cease for half
an hour
io

the bunkel mystery

   the dam has broken away  exclaimed andy who was the first to
speak after the tremendous flash and crash

     fire and flash do not cojmeout of water unless it has some help replied
the machinist as he led the way into the main road  the dam has been
blown up

   what could blow it up   asked andy who followed his father who
deemed it wise to place himself and his son at a greater distance from the
scene of the catastrophe

    it did not blow itself up and either powder or dynamite has been at
the bottom of it this is the work of some enemy of mr barkpool and it is
just what might be expected at any time while this senseless quarrel lasts
said mr lamb as he heard excited voices behind him

    how could any one put powder or dynamite where it would blow up the
dam inquired andy who wanted to know how the thing lad been done

    very easily my son on the other side of the river the formation of
the shore will allow a person to pass under the sheet of the water that
pours over the dam the machinist explained the fall is high on this
side and one can walk under it half way across the stream

    i never heard there was any such place there added andy

    mr barkpool sent me to examine the dam about a year ago and i dis-
covered the opening i reported it but he told me not to mention it for
people would certainly wish to visit the place and he thought it was danger-
ous he was sure phin would be into it if lie knew of it the powder was
no doubt placed under the falling sheet of water and discharged with a slow
match or something of that sort

    then others must have known of this thing

    some one else must have discovered it

   mr lamb and andy walked at a rapid pace while the roaring of the
river compelled them to speak in a loud tone in order to be heard above it
they reached the cottage without seeing any person for those who had been
startled by the explosion all ran to the dam those who heard the collapse
of the lower dam doubtless hastened in that direction mrs lamb had heard
the crash and the roaring of the waters in the river and had gone out of the
house into the darkness to ascertain what had happened and was at the front
gate when her husband and son arrived

   mr lamb explained the matter to her and they went into the house
at first she thought it was an earthquake and then a peal of thunder  but
the roaring she cqiild not account for as soon as they were in the house
she took a letter from the mantel and handed it to andy

   whats this mother he asked for he was not much in the habit of
receiving letters

    i dont know what it is  i havent opened it you had not been gone
five minutes before a man came to the door and asked for you when i
told him you were not at home he left that letter replied mrs lamb

    i wonder whom its from added andy looking at the address

    you can tell by opening it said his mother with a smile

    ah here is the address of percival singerlay on the envelope  ex-
the bunkel mystery

claimed andy  this is from di i suppose she thinks she did not thank
me enough for helping her

    andy opened the letter and found that it was not from the fair skipper
but from her father the magnate of montoban said he was actually sorry
for what had happened and wished him to call at the house as soon as he
possibly could andy read it and then passed it to his father then his
mother looked at it

      shall i go father   asked andy

     certainly  go at once my son replied the machinist without any hesi-
tation that is a friendly letter

     i dont want to curry favor with him said andy

     he seems to be genuinely sorry for having treated you the way he did
and you were too proud to explain how you happened to be on his grounds
after he had accused you of stealing his strawberries he sends for you and
i do not think that you will demean yourself at all by going to see him re-
plied the father

    i wish you could go with me father suggested andy

   mr lamb considered a moment and then said he would do so mrs
lamb would go with them a part of the way and call upon a friend in the
road they found a great many people on foot and in vehicles hastening to the
onongo mill to ascertain what had happened there

   the machinist informed those who asked for information that the upper
dam had been blown up and his supposition that the lower one had been car-
ried away by the sudden rush of the immense volume of water was confirmed
the whole town was out of doors and great excitement prevailed the news
that the upper dam had been blown up was brought by the machinist and it
did not tend to allay the uproar the whole of the lower town appeared to
be gathered on the bank of the river

    andy and his father did not find the magnate at home or even any of his
family for they had all gone out to see the havoc of the waters even the
servants were not in the house they went to the shore where a large fire
had been built to throw its light on the dashing stream but there was-
uothing to be seen for the water had done its work  the dam had been car-
ried away and only the wreck of it remained

    but the furious flow of the water was subsiding as the pressure was re-
duced from above and the people soon returned to their homes when there
was nothing more to be seen just above the dam was a bridge  but fortu-
natelj it had been built high enough to be out of the reach of the rushing
tide and it had not been carried away it was crowded with people looking
at the dashing water

    as the inhabitants left the scene all of them were talking about the event
aud asking who had blown up the onongo dam it could not have been an
enemy of mr singerlay for the deed had been done at the the upper dam 
but it was evident that the villain whoever he was had done more than he
intended for both dams had been destroyed

   andy and his father returned to the mansion of the magnate but he had
not arrived though they found dolph in the house he had just come in


the bunkel mystery

and he seemed to be out of breath his clothes were wet and covered with
yellow mud and he was certainly in a very bad plight

     your father has not yet come in has he  asked mr lamb as he met
dolph in the hall

     not yet but he will be in before long replied dolph so exhausted
that he could with difficulty utter the words

     you look as though you had had a hard time of it dolph added andy
looking him over

     i went down to look out for ni boat and a big wave dashed up on the
shore and threw me down answered the rich mans son

     were the boats carried away  asked andy

    no they both held on but i thought the dragon would be stove
against the shore that is they were both there-i think theare all right
stammered dolph who did not seem to be quite sure about the boats  i
must go and put on some dry clothes for i am wet to the skin

    he went up the stairs evidently in a hurry when he saw his father
come in at the front door mr singerlay did not seem to be at all depressed
by the loss of the dam and welcomed andy

chapter xii-the interview with the magnate

    i am glad to see you andy lamb  and if you had only told me how
you happened to be in my grounds it would have been all right said mr
singerlay as he gave his hand to the young man  i am very sorry i was
so rude to you and i apologize for it i am glad to see you mr lamb for
i believe you are the father of andy  

    it was certainly very magnanimous  the part of the mighty magnate of
montoban to apologize to a boy like andy for unlike dolph he believed
that a young fellow of sixteen was still a boy and he was so embarrassed
that he could hardly say a word

      it is all right sir  and it is my fault that i did not explain howr i hap-
pened to be in your grounds replied andy

    di cried like a baby when she learned what had happened and i pro-
mised to make it right with you if i could continued mr singerlay as he
invited his guests to be seated   and di thinks you are the greatest man
in montoban and i am inclined to think that she is more than half right
you were a brave young fellow to stand up against a pair of revolvers in the
hands of a desperate young vagabond

    i dodged dowrn into the bottom of the boat and there was not much
danger sir when tom sawder did the shooting said andy

     no matter-what you did  it was plucky and you deserve a gold medal
added the magnate with enthusiasm and andy found it difficult to believe
that the speaker was the same gentleman who had dragged him into the house
by the collar a couple of hours before

    while they were talking di and her mother came in

     its all right di exclaimed her father  andy has forgiven me for
my bad behavior
the bunkel mystery

i

    i am glad to see you again andy and i was sorry that anything un-
pleasant happened on your way from the boat house said di with a gush
which overwhelmed the modest champion

    no matter about that miss singerlay  it is all right now and if you
please we wont say another word about it replied andy  i am very
glad i was able to be of some service to you  

    but you had to fightfor it and i see that you have some of the scars
of battle on your face now andy interposed the magnate  it is mar-
velous to me that you were able to hold your own against that bruiser for
the policemen say he is an ugly customer  

    i had something better to fight for than he had replied andy glattcitig
involuntarily at di

    i have got out a warrant for the arrest of the four vagabonds who
made the second attack and three of them have been arrested they are
in the lockup  but tom sawder could not be found said mr singerlay
 you will be wanted as a witness tomorrow andy 

    we left them all clinging to the wreck of their boat and i wonder how
they got ashore  added andy who had heard nothing from the hoodlums
since his return

    i sent two officers down in the dragon aud they found all the rascals
except tom mr singerlay explained  they said a man had come after
them in a boat and had landed them on the west side of the island

    who was this man  asked andy

    the boys did not know him or pretended they did not as soon as he
had put them ashore he pulled away with tom aud that was the last they
saw of either of them they say that they heard high words between toni
and the man when the boat had passed around a point

    but where did the boat go  inquired andy

    the boys could not tell they walked across the island to what they
call the landing rock but the boat was not there and both the man and tom
had disappeared then the officers took the boys and sailed around the island
and walked all over it in search of the missing vagabond  but they could not
find him the man or the boat

   that is very strange said mr lamb

    very singular indeed i questioned the boys myself and i am inclined
to believe that they told the truth for they were very badly scared added
the magnate

   then andy told what he knew about the stranger on bunkel island  but
the party did not make any progress in solving the mystery which had
bothered the inquirer at the time he was in the diana

    there is one thing about this affair which impresses me more than any-
thing else said mr singerlay after they had exhausted the discussion of
the mystery  andy does not belong on my side of the controversy which
has been kept alive between barkpool and myself for over two years though
he belongs to the onongo faction he went to the assistance of my daughter
when she needed help and if barkpool himself would do such a deed peace
would be made at once
h

the bunkel mystery

    i am afraid he will never do such a thing added mr lamb shaking
his head

     but i will if i get the chance   exclaimed mr singerlay springing
out of his chair in the excitement of the moment  with the example of
andy before me i feel just as though i could do something noble and magna-
nimous even towards my great enemy  

    neither andy nor his father deemed it prudent to say anything upon this
remarkable proposition of the magnate mrs singerlay declared that she
would be willing to live on two meals a day if the senseless quarrel could be
brought to an end

    andy is hardfy a member of either faction suggested mr lamb who
thought his son was getting rather more credit for magnanimity than he
deserved

    but barkpools son was in the boat with him and ordered him not to
meddle with the matter the boy was just like his father and would have
let the rascal abuse my daughter to his hearts content argued the magnate
very earnestly  andy had to stand up against phin and leave his boat in
spite of him  and he did it it was a noble action and i appreciate it more
than any other person can

    except me added di

    just as you like di now what can i do for this young man to whom
we owe so much  continued mr singerlay looking at the machinist  i
am sure that barkpool will punish him in some manner for what he has done
and he is malicious enough even to punish the father for the deed of the son 

     he has done so already sir replied mr lamb

   what  has he discharged you    demanded the magnate

   he has  simply because i insisted that my son had done nothing more
than his duty

    mr lamb described the scene at the residence of mr barkpool

    when was this asked the magnate

   not five minutes before the explosion which carried away the upper
dam answered the engineer

     then five minutes later he would not have done it added mr singer-
lay rubbing his hands  both dams are gone and we must use steam my
machinist and engineer died last winter and i have not yet found another i
was thinking what i should do when i came into the house from the river i
will give you a hundred dollars a month for a year with a better house than
you have now rent free

     i am out of a job and of course i accept said mr lamb laughing

    you will have to go to work tonight for barkpool must see our mill in
operation as usual tomorrow morning added the magnate

    the engineer assented and went to the engine room

chapter xiii-the vault of the montoban bank

   while mr singerlay went to the mill with the engineer andy remained
 ith di and her mother he had hardly left the house before dolph came
the bunkel mystery



down stairs he had changed his clothes and looked like himself again for
he might easily have been mistaken for a common laborer when he came into
the house

   dolph had heard nothing about the affair on the lake for he had gone
away as soon as his father had refused to comply with his request to supply
the money for the purchase of a steamer he was a good deal surprised to
see his sister  such good terms with andy but he did not ask any questions

   the magnate returned as soon as he had shown the new engineer the
engine room and mr lamb came with him for he found everything in order
there and it was not necessary to start the fires till after midnight

   while mr singerlay and the engineer were talking about the running of
the mill the next day mr roblock the cashier of the montoban bank came
in to bring the keys the magnate was the president of the institution and
he had a theory of his own in regard to the security of banks he did not
believe in trusting any one and the cashier was hardly more than a clerk

   he was required to carry the keys to the house of the president when he
closed the bank and to come for them in the morning the official did not
object to this method though it was rather humiliating for if any one was
taken from his bed in the night at the muzzle of a revolver it would be the
president and not himself

    you are rather late mr roblock said the magnate with a frown on
his brow as he consulted his watch  have you been out to see the river
with the keys in your pocket  

    no sir  i have not been out of the bank since i closed at five oclock
replied the cashier annoyed at this implied suspicion   i have not been to
supper yet for i have only just finished my work

    i hope you do your work as far as possible in the day time added the
president as he took the keys

    i do sir  and this is the first time for a year thatj have kept the keys
till after dark answered the cashier with his lips compressed

    the pont port bank was robbed last week and i think you have more
cash on hand than usual at the present time continued the magnate

    i have nearly a hundred thousand dollars in the vault

    you will not have so large a sum for a long time said mr singerlay
with a smile   i was thinking of building a better dam as soon as the dry
time came for the old one was getting very weak as has been fully proved
tonight

    i heard that the dam had been carried away as i came along the street
added the cashier who seemed to be the only man in town who had not been
out to see the scene of the wreck  i hardly believed it though i heard a
strange roaring sound for some time  

    the upper dam was blown up and the rush of water carried the lower
one away

   the cashier asked a few questions but he did not seem to be much inter-
ested  and it was evident that he would resign his office as soon as he could
find another where his self respect would not be a constant burden to him

    take these keys up to my room dolph said the magnate as soon as the
i

the bunkel mystery

cashier had gone  where have jrou been all the evening  you did not
come in to supper  

     i was on board of the dragon when the dam broke away and i ate my
supper in the standing room on what was left of my last lunch replied the
young gentleman with a forced smile as the engineer thought

     were you in the boat when the dam gave way  asked his father

    i was  and the rush of the water carried the dragon on shore answered
dolph putting a good deal of excitement real or assumed into his manner
 i vvas thrown down and nearly washed away but i saved myself by the skin
of my teeth

       were either of the sail boats damaged   

     not a particle i left them all right at their moorings 

     you left them all right  demanded mr singerlay

       i did  they both held fast  

    what do you mean dolph  both of them broke from their moorings
and i sent a man to pick them up before i came into the house

     they were all right when i left them persisted the hopeful son though
it was evident that he had put his foot in it i left them all right and went
on the bridge to see the water running through the break

     when did you leave the boats asked mr singerlay with a heavy
frown on his brow for it looked as though there was something wrong in the
sons statement

    i left after the first rush of water was over

    and the boats were at their moorings then   

     yes sir

     but i saw them a long way from the bridge myself when i went out
of course they broke loose at the first rush of water in less than two minutes
after the dam gave way

     if they broke away at all it was some time after the first rush said
dolph doggedly

    no matter now  we will talk about it another time added mr sin-
gerlay put the keys in my room

     i am going to bed now- for i am tired out added dolph as left the
room

    there was something strange about dolphs conduct and as it looked as
though there might be a case of domestic discipline mr lamb had risen from
his chair and gone to the door followed by andy di and her mother had
gone with them so far to bid them good night as soon as the son was out
of the room they took their leave mr singerlays brow was badly
wrinkled and as soon as di was gone he told his wife that something must
be done with their son

    the magnate saw that dolph had been lying to him but he was unable
to penetrate his object in doing so he talked of sending the young man to
a military school in the state where he would be subjected to strict disci-
pline the mother objected and they went to their room still discussing
the question he was so interested in the subject that he did not observe
that the bank keys were not on the table at the head of his bed
the bunkel mystery



   dolph went to bed as he said he should but he did not get to sleep iu
fact he was not at all inclined to sleep when the clock struck twelve on
the church near the mansion he got out of bed and dressed himself taking
the utmost care not to make any noise midnight was a late hour in monto-
ban and all holiest people were fast asleep

   when he had completed his toilet he took the bunch of bank keys from
between the mattresses on his bed and put them in a side pocket of his coat
then he opened the door with the same care he had used in dressing himself
to avoid making any noise he carried his shoes in his hand and when he
reached the hall he could hear his father snore for the magnate had this un-
fortunate habit fully developed

   without hindrance of any kind he reached the street and then the monto-
ban bank he was entirely familiar with the building and the cashier had
gratified his curiosity by showing him how the vault was opened and where
he kept the money dolph was a privileged person and it was not prudent
to refuse to answer his questions or even to prevent him from entering the
vault

   dolph went behind the counter and lighted a small lantern which he had
taken from the hall of the house  but he put his handkerchief over it so that
the light should not be seen by any person in the street if any one should
chance to be out at this unseemly hour thus prepared he went to the
vault and had inserted one of the keys when he heard a noise at one of the
windows of the back room which was used by the directors

   he listened and heard a boring and grinding sound it occurred to him
that some one intended to rob the bank but he had come for a purpose
and he determined to carry it out  then he would give the alarm and drive
away the robbers

   he opened the vault after some time for it was not an easy thing for one
who had had so little experience with the locks he intended to take the
sum he wanted put it in his pocket and then return the keys to his fathers
chamber so that he could find them on the little table at the head of his bed
when he woke in the morning

   dolph did not think the job would take more than two minutes of his
time he was aware that the cashier would have to explain how his cash
happened to be short the next day it looked like a very simple operation
to the young man  and he was not in the habit of vexing himself over moral
questions

   he was excited for he was not used to this kind of business and it took
him longer than he expected to get into the vault though he got there at
last as soon as he was inside of the strong box he removed the cover-
ing from the lantern as he did so a strong pair of hands was placed at his
throat and he was dragged from the safe

   when he tried to shout his captor choked him he was thrown on the
floor and two persons stood over him one of them pointing a revolver at
his head

the singing teacher

an unlooked for episode in a sinking mountain courtship-the dogged pujpose of jim turpin
after he discovers the disloyalty of his betrothed and the sequel to the outcome

c eated upon a high point of rock on the north side of sinking mountain
were two men silently gazing out over the lower hills and valleys the
two men wore heavy boots dark shirts and broad brimmed hats with the
brims turned up and pinned to the crowns in front with hawthorns one of
the men held a long rifle across his lap and the other wore a belt in which
were a rough hunting knife and a pistol

   pears like the revenuers air keepin kinder quiet of ate remarked
the smaller of the two men

    yes assented the other

    mebbe the moneys gin out though i guess thet aint hit neither case
they must have a lot of it

   the larger man did not reply and for several minutes the silence was un-
broken except by the sounds of a chopping axe which was being vigorously
handled by some one on the opposite hillside

at length the smaller man again spoke this time turning half around
in order to face the big man while a mischievous light shone from his eyes

    thinking about jo and the singin teacher i reckon

   there was no reply and in a few moments the man continued thet fel-
lers got a purty good class down at the fork school house hes an uncom-
mon good lookin chap an jo randalls a gal at likes good looks or i guess
some o the rest on usd stand a better chance alongside o you not sayin
nothin no ways flatterin jim

    have you seed im ike  jim wanted to know

    oh yes ive been down thar to singin once or twice hes eddi-
cated an wears purty good clothes  an some on em lowed he come from
atlanta  

   jim frowned but did not say anything and the other went on  hes a
boardin at old burt randalls an fust off jim hell have jos heart clean
away from you -i tell you you better sorter go down an see about it
thars no tellin about these ere fellows that come from town

   jim rose his towering figure throwing a huge shadow behind him as he
swung the long old rifle over his shoulder

    i guess ill goto that ar singin school tonight he said as he turned
and strode away along the narrow path closely followed by his companion

   the fork school house was situated on the south side of the mountain near
where the small stream emptied into the chatooga river and here eester
wilkes was teaching a singing school at night wilkes had come up into
the mountains to rusticate he was a good singer and had announced
the singing teacher

r

that he would teach a singing school while he was there if one of the
randall boys would get up a class of a dozen or more who would be
willing to pay a small tuition fee alf randall had found  difficulty
in organizing a class and now the school was in a flourishing condition
every other night wilkes and the randalls would wend their way down
the river to the school house  and it was soon noticed that the teacher was
particularly attentive to josephine randall whose pink cheeks and bright
eyes were attractive to more than one young mountaineer it was at about
this stage of th e progress of the singing school that jim turpin decided to
pay it a visit although he seldom ventured far from the green forests and the
shelving rocks of the mountain on account of the vigilance of the raiders
who were scouting around here aud there at almost all times endeavoring
to capture the king of the blockaders

   jim strode into the school house his big form almost blocking up the
doorway as he passed through it and took a seat far back where he re-
mained a silent spectator and listener until the lesson was closed he
watched the smiles and pretty glances which the teacher bestowed upon
jo and a great hard lump began to form in jims throat

   when the class was at last dismissed turpin waited just outside the
door until jo came out when he caught her by the sleeve and gently drew
her aside while he bent down and rapidly whispered in her ear 

   jo i cant git to see you often but as theres a heaven above its dont
forgit at i love you

   no no i wont jim she skid as her hand slipped through his
which pressed it gently though firmly then she hurried away to join the
others before she was missed

   jim turned and strode off through the darkness and was soon making his
way up over the mountain trail

	   

   on top of a granite cliff stood the figure of a man in the darkness the
stars were shining overhead but there was  moou  and the deepest dark-
ness reigned throughout the dense forest back of the cliff the figure was
intently watching the movements of a faint light which was moving mysteri-
ously through the woods on the opposite ridge jim turpin watched it
closely as it rounded the head of the ravine and came on towards him down
the cliff ridge evidently it was some one carrying a torch but who could
it be  now the light was hidden a few moments then it came up again
bobbing up and down as the bearer came on over the uneven surface of the
trail which turned at a point on the cliff not far from where jim stood and
thence zigzagged tortuously down its rugged face the watcher did not
move only turning his head slowly to follow with his eyes the course of the
torch bearer

    at length the latter came to the point where the trail turned on the cliff
and jim started from his rigid posture as he recognized jo randall and the
singing teacher jo carried a small torch and was leading the way
jims hand which held the long rifle trembled and he clutched the gun with
such a grip that the nails of his fingers almost pierced the palm of his hand


the singing teacher

jo and wilkes came to a halt and jo having placed the torch in a niche of
the rock at her side turned to the singing teacher with a white face

    we cant go no further with a light she said   well have to ieave
hit here till we come back theyd see us arter we git down this ere
cliff 

    all right my dear said wilkes as he drew near to her back iu the
darkness stood jim almost choked with the emotions that raged within him

    perhaps wed better hurry on continued wilkes taking jo caress-
ingly by the arm it is getting late and i only want to find out where it
is tonight  

   but jo stood still  and from his cover of darkness jim could see tears in
her eyes as she spoke

    somehow i dont feel like im a doin jest ezactly right a sliowiu you
the way to jims still house even ef-ef we air a gwine to be married

    oh come now jo said wilkes placing his arm around her waist and
drawing her closely to him  my little jo my sweetheart we dont want to
punish jim we only want to get him down to atlanta and show him what
a great wrong it is to defraud the government then he will come back home
a better man  and you my darling will go with me to atlanta where we will
be married  and some day we can have jim to visit us and he will be glad
that you have found a home where you need want for nothing i know jim
is a good fellow but you deserve more than he will ever be able to give you
for he will always be dodging the law now dont you love me better than
you do jim  

   yes yes i believe i do you are so different from jim but he is
so good jim is an youll promise me they shant harm him not airy hair
of his head   

    why yes  havent i promised it a thousand times already  

    yes but i wanted you to promise it again right here afore we go any
furder  

   out in the darkness jim was still listening but now there were tears in
his eyes

    an you wont go to the still house tonight arter youve seed it  

   no no we will go back home then  and i will come tomorrow night
and bring some men from tallulah

    oh im afeared they will kill jim

    oh no  the men will only come to carry away the still i know jim
will go along with us peaceably  

   wilkes kissed her two or three times then released her find the two be-
gan to make their way down over the rough pass through the darkness

   for a moment jim stood motionless then walked to the edge of the cliff
and lowering himself over its side hung for a moment by his hands to the
jutting rock before dropping into space it was twelve or fifteen feet to the
ledge below and another ten feet to the base of the cliff where jim landed
in a few seconds and strode swiftly away down the ravine five minutes
later he stood in the doorway of a low rough cabin near the center of
which stood a rock furnace with a glowing fire under the copper kettle

         which rested upon it two or three men were seated about the place but
         as jim entered they rose

             whats the matter jim  asked one of them

             singin teachers a detective

             involuntarily the hands of the moonshiners went to their pistol belts

            boys continued jim after a brief pause i want you to git case
         the detectives purty close here an lies got a guide what knows the trail

             narry a git said one  whos the guide

              thats one thing i aint a tellin said jim  but i said git an git ye
          shall go by the fork trail sos you wont meet him dye understand 

            jim turpin was usually understood when he spoke

              pinter lie continued turning to one of the men  im gwine to leave
         everything to ou case i know youll treat me fair and squar not sayiu
         anythin agin the rest of ye git everythin outn here afore tomorrow night

          thet for

              for reasons i aint a tellin replied jim as he turned and walked away
          through the darkness again

             hurrying oil by the route over which he came jim reached the cliffwhere
         the torch was still burning and waited for the return of jo and wilkes
         when they reached the top of the rocks jim stepped out from the darkness
         and confronted them quick as a flash wilkes covered him with a revolver

              i gin up said jim  an i want you to take me right - along tonight
         put up your gn  when i gin up i gin up an jo he continued turning
         to the girl  dont you cry i hearn it all an i know it aint no fault o

         a long time an a puttin by an a puttin by till i got a right smart chance
         o gold laid away a hopin-a hopin that some day-

           im ready mister he broke off suddenly turning toward wilkes
        then abruptly snatching the torch from its crevice he strode up the ridge
        followed by jo and the singing teacher

            the train which bore jim turpin a prisoner to atlanta bore jo randall
         to the same place to become the wife of his rival and captor lester wilkes

    	   

            jim turpin had completed his twelve months term in fulton county jail
         he had been released on saturday and had been spending sunday in seeing
         the city before his departure for the hills again jim had never seen or
         heard of jo since they had parted on arriving in the city more than a year
         before but now as he wandered through the many streets of the gate city
         he was watching every door and every window on either side of the street in
         a vague sort of way yet he was not quite sure that he wanted to see jo it
         was growing late in the afternoon  already the high electric lights were aglow
         and jim began to think of returning from his walk he had turned about
         and was walking along a narrow street which wtas lined by two rows of dingy
         looking houses his chin lay against his breast and he had dropped into a
         not altogether pleasant reverie

                      


the plunge

    but lie was suddenly aroused from this mood by the rustling of skirts as
a woman swept past him jim raised his head looked for a moment after
the retreating figure then started in rapid pursuit despite the dull twilight
which had settled down he had recognized the form  and when he had ap-
proached within a few feet of her he called her name  jo  there was no
answer and the woman increased her speed but jims long strides soon
brought him up with her and he was walking by her side

    jo said jim  aint you a gwine to speak to me

    oh jim  exclaimed the voice which he had once known so well as
the woman buried her face in her hands  please go on an leave me

    leave you what for i wonder i reckon ive got a right to speak
to you in passing aint i jo

    but you dont know all sobbed the woman  oh jim i aint what
i used to be when you loved me

    whats the matter whars the singin teacher 

     i haint seed him in a long time oh oh jim  dont ever tell em at
home any bettern at im married to the singin teacher

    jims brow contracted in a deep frown as all became clear to his under-
standing  and they walked along for more than a block in silence at length
jim spoke

     jo theyre a needin of you at home your mothers a gittin old you
know an cant do all the cookin an spinnin im a gwine home an if
youll meet me at the car shed in the moruiu well go long home together
ive got money enough for two tickets will you come jo

   yes jim ill come oh jim weve served twelve mouths apiece but
my punishments been a hundred times worse than yourn

    they parted soon afterwards  and jim returned to the business part of the
city with a dark cloud overshadowing his brow but with the light of a de-
termined purpose gleaming from his eyes

   when he came to the car shed the following morning he found jo waiting
for him and a few moments later they were seated in an east bound train

   jo said jim as they rolled out of the station singin teachers
dead

the plunge

               there is a rapture in the headlong leap

               the wedgelike cleaving of the closing deep 

               a feeling full of hardihood aud power

               with which we court the waters that devour
               oh  tis a feeling great sublime supreme
               like the ecstatic influence of a dream

a month in the moon

the marvelous experiences that grew out of the lunar company limited-how the catch-
penny scheme of three adventurers was transformed into an extraordinary
contribution to the world of science-scenes and incidents
of a sojourn on the earths satellite

synopsis of chapters previously published

    messrs gryphins vogel and wagner three adventurers in melbourne australia start
the lunar company for the conquest and exploration of the mineral riches of the moon
 but how are we to get to the moon   is the question asked by large numbers of stockholders
and at a public meeting wagner talks learnedly of a tubular tunnel but has his theory utterly
demolished by norbert mauny a young frenchman who declares that in order to complete such
a piece of work within the stipulated time of five years it must rise at the rate of  miles a
year 

   the assembhige is panic stricken and the stockholders demand their money back when
mauny calls for order and announces that he has a plan to propose-that of attracting the
moon to the earth by erecting a series of powerful magnets the idea is received with
enthusiasm and mauny is voted manager of the company the bayouda desert in the soudan
is selected as the site for the erection of the magnets the expedition sets out at suakim
mauny meets the french consul m kersain and his daughter gertrude who decide to ac-
company him on a visit to the mogaddem of rliadameh a local ruler whose favor must be
obtained before the transportation of the material across the desert can be made

    this mogaddem is a weird sort of personage and possesses a hideously ugly dwarf after
promising to pay certain large sums as tribute norbert secures the cooperation he desires and
soon after the return to the seaport the expedition sets out for the bayouda desert here the
observatories reflectors etc are erected on the peak of tehbali and work proceeds with grati-
fying success till messrs gryphins vogel and wagner are detected in a conspiracy to turn the
workmen against norbert they are imprisoned and a guard placed over them and then
norbert hearing that trouble threatens khartoum where m kersain has been transferred
determines to go ihither and see if he cannot induce him and his daughter to take refuge at the
peak

    the consul refuses to leave his post but it is finally arranged that gertrude accompanied by
dr briet her uncle and fatima her maid set out with norbert for tehbali on the road they meet
a woman fig seller and shortly after eating some of her fruit a deep sleep falls on all members
of the party ori awaking gertrude discovers that she is in a strange but beautiful apartment
with only fatima who sleeps near her but presently the hideous dwarf of the mogaddem of
rhadameh presents himself and offers his hand in marriage failing in this he resolves to
march with the forces he possesses on the peak taking the prisoners with him and there de-
stroy before their very eyes the work on which mauny has built such high hopes but it turns
out that the men employed by the young astronomer and those in the service of the dwarf come
from the same country and they refuse to fight against one another kaddour is taken captive
and placed in charge of virgil maunys right hand man discovered in an attempt to win
away the allegiance of the negro guard he is condemned to he shot but swallows poison just
before the execution is to take place soon afterward the mahdis forces surround the peak and
call upon mauny to surrender which he stoutly refuses to do

    meantime the magnets are working splendidly and at length norbert sets in operation the
forces that in six days are to bring the moon down to the earth the satellite responds readily
and by the sixth day is so close and appears so immense that not only are the mahdis forces
utterly panic stricken but norberts party themselves are terrified

    sir bucephalus coghill one of the chief members of the company ventures to hint to the

young- astronomer that he thinks it would be safer for all hands if the experiment be stopped-
which mauny says can be done by simply touching- two knobs-when the bjronets valet tyrrel
smith in an agony of apprehension rushes to the tablet where the knobs controlling all the
motors are situated raises one and lowers another a fearful crash ensues and all are thrown
into insensibility

chapter xxvi-after the catastrophe

j t was broad daylight a deep silence reigned in the tehbali observatory
when norbert opened his eyes the intensity of the silence was remark-
able it was in the strictest sense a deathlike silence

    the day was a brilliant one and the heat quite overpowering

at first norbert had some difficulty in recollecting what had happened

   he found himself on his back thrown down doubtless by the first shock
of the cataclysm on an arab divan underneath the ebony shelf in the hall of
motors everything around was in disorder  the furniture scattered about
and the electric apparatus twisted while the magnetometer lay on the ground
broken as also were all the objects made of porcelain

    gertrude fatima the doctor the baronet and the valet lay round about
some on the sofa where the earthquake had found them the others on the
matting that covered the floor

    norberts first care was to run to the assistance of mile kersain whose
name as wre know had been the last on his lips she was in a deep sw-oon
but otherwise apparently unharmed her pulse beat feebly and a faint sigh
came through her half closed lips

   from her norbert instinctively turned to the doctor he was crouched
under the arm chair where when the shock came he had been quietly
drinking his tea seemingly his alarm had passed off into sleep for norbert
just touched him on the arm and he awoke rubbing his eyes vigorously and
looking about him in evident astonishment

    he jumped to his feet but for a moment was silent as if stupefied then
turning to norbert he said 

      what has happened to us  

    i cannot say  but it is a blessing to seeyou up again come to your
niece first there she is quite unconscious  

    letting himself be led to the sofa the doctor took the girl s hand and felt
her pulse mechanically as it were standing there silent and motionless as if
he had no power to speak

     her pulse beats at all events does it not impatiently asked norbert
who had seized her other hand  what ought to be done 

    with as it seemed a tremendous effort of the will the doctor muttered
dreamily the words 

     medicine chest  

    norbert understood he ran into the adjoining office to fetch the chest
stumbling on the way over virgil who lay insensible on the floor and
quickly hastened back

    what medicine shall i give you  he asked as he pressed the spring
lock
a month in the moon



    sulphuric ether answered the doctor still dreamily

    seeing that it was useless to ask for further instructions norbert took the
little bottle so labeled out of its case and held it under gertrudes nostrils
moistening at the same time her temples and forehead

    the rapid evaporation of the fluid was instantly followed by a sensation of
freshness which soon revived the young girl she opened her eyes sat up
on the couch and looked about her with astonishment	

    fatima   she murmured faintly on seeing her companion still insen-
sible

    she is unconscious as we all were five minutes ago said norbert as
he went up to the little maid and administered ether to her also  but she
will soon revive look   

   fatima repeated gertrude poor little girl you were dreadfully
frightened were you not 

    oh yes dreadfully frightened  but it is all over now see mistress
i can walk again

   she made two or three steps and flung herself into gertrudesxmtstretched
arms

   norbert had gone off to attend to the baronet

    he is only stunned like the others and you dont seem to be quite
yourself doctor even now continued norbert  a good dose of ether will
not do you any harm

   so saying he suited the action to the word and brought the doctor round
with his own remedy

   it is true said briet i feel quite dazed still many thanks dear
mauny for your attention now we must see after coghill his pulse is
marvelously weak quite thread-like in fact however lets hope he will be
all right better rub his head with brandy i think i will do it if you will
attend to the other one  

    to that individual there who was the cause of all this topsy turvy busi-
ness do you think i am going to attend to that fellow no virgil
comes before smith i shall look after him first

   hastening into an adjoining apartment norbert raised that worthy servant
from his liarc couch on the floor and rubbed and shook him till at last he
showed signs of life

    halloa  it is daylight  and we are still alive   cried virgil awak-
ening to the consciousness of his surroundings  i didnt expect to be here
after that earthquake   

   meanwhile thanks to briet both sir bucephalus and his valet were once
more astir the latters personal appearance was not improved by an enor-
mous bump on the forehead he sat up on the matting and stared about him
aimlessly without apparently realizing that he had been the direct cause of
the catastrophe

    i really dont know why we should keep the windows closed said
norbert  the heat is suffocating  - 

   he opened one of the windows but shut it again immediately so violent
a draft was caused this was very odd for the current of air came from


a month in the moon

within and every other opening was still closed norbert was looking round
to find out the reason when gertrude exclaimed from the other window 

    what a very strange view  i never saw anything like it  the earth-
quake must have turned everything upside down all round us

   every one ran to see what was the matter

   the changes were indeed remarkable in place of the yellow sandy plain
that formerly stretched iu uniform monotony almost to the very foot of teh-
bali broken only here and there by a few undulations they now beheld an
abyss whence rose up sharply defined serrated mountains

   it appeared as if the crust had given way under the influence of some
mighty subterranean force that had torn up the surface and redistributed it
in weird fantastic forms

    bright red staring yellow pale blue and violet colored rocks stood out on
every side in a medley of color that was far from pleasing to the eye in the
ravines flowed lava of every hue similar to that found on vesuvius and etna
it was in fact evident that they were real volcanic craters now extinct and
silent there they were side by side of every imaginable height and size

   it was impossible to estimate the distance properly for by a strange op-
tical illusion the rocks that were furthest stood out as clearly as the near ones
dowm to the least little detail instead of diminishing gradually to the van-
ishing point they were so boldly defined against the sky that it seemed almost
as if it were possible to touch their bright colored edges

   another remarkable circumstance was that the shadows were as clearly
portraed in the blinding light as were the rocks themselves they were all
as black as ink without any graduation or shading off

   the aspect of the landscape was more terrifying and spectral than can be
conceived there was no trace of life anywhere neither bird bush nor
blade of grass was to be seen  nor was the silence broken by the sound of
any trickling brook the impression left upon the mind was that of utter
solitude desolation and death

   another strange phenomenon was to be noted although the sun shone
in the full blaze of his meridian splendor on the bare and dreary waste myriads
of starry constellations were apparent in the deep gloom of the sky the
effect was startling it was similar to that produced by lighted candles round
a funeral bier in broad daylight

   as to the hostile mahdist and arab camps that had encircled the peak of
tehbali they were nowhere to be seen  all trace of them had disappeared
the catastrophe had seemingly swallowed up tents batteries men and
beasts 

   but the strangest fact was the great height from which they now looked
down it seemed as if in the general upheaval the earth at the foot of the
mountain had shrunk at the same time this was the general impression
their eyes had been accustomed for a long while to the vertical distance of
four or five thousand feet separating them from the plain  but this was
something quite differentfor they looked down now from a height of at least
fifteen or twenty thousand feet perhaps even more

   amazement kept them all silent they were spellbound
a month in the moon



   on a sudden norbert darted to the door and ran on to the esplanade as
if a new idea had struck him

   but he had talen only a few steps when he felt himself greatly oppressed
the blood mounted to his brain he gasped for breath staggered and had -
but just time to get back to the observatory he was on the point of suffo-
cation

   as soon as he got indoors he felt relieved at once his lungs resumed
their function and he breathed freely again

   to the general surprise he rushed to the half open door and slammed it
violently  then hurrying to the two windows he carefully stopped up every
crevice with all the bits of rag he could lay hands on

   what are you doing asked the baronet are you afraid of a
draft  

    i am hoarding up the little amount of air that we have answered nor-
bert  when we have used up what we have now we shall have no more 

   they looked at one another with curiosity

   had the catastrophe perchance turned even his well balanced brain
was he under some temporary hallucination 

   he read the thought in the doctors eyes and could not repress a smile

   oh make yourselves easy he said iam not mad but i have
something to tell you which is of much greater importance and of which you
are far from having the least suspicion  mademoiselle he continued turn-
ing to gertrude  are you strong enough to bear a great surprise and i fear
a painful one 

   gertrude grew pale  but she looked at the young astronomer bravely

    speak on she replied with her usual calm dignity  i promise to be
courageous whatever it is anything is preferable to suspense  

     listen then a while ago you were remarking upon the extraordinary
changes in our surroundings  you attributed them and doubtless you still
attribute them to the catastrophe that had nigh been the death of us all
well it is no such thing  nothing has changed around us of that i am
certain it is we who have changed place we are no longer in a state of
siege we are castaways  we are no longer in the soudan we are no longer
in africa nor even on the terrestrial globe  we- have been transported-to
the moon   

    to the moon  cried sir bucephalus  do you mean to say that the
rocks and craters around us are part of the lunar landscape   

    precisely so replied norbert  i have not yet studied the question
sufficiently to be able to tell you how it has happened that the disaster has
transported us and all our belongings from the plateau of tehbali to a lunar
plateau but there can be no doubt that we were blown into the air and then
drawn up by the attraction of the moon

      this is only an hypothesis of yours  

    but the fact remains that we are actually transplanted to a new world
separated from our own by an immense distance and there is every proof
that this new world can be no other than the moon  you see for yourselves
that everything now before your eyes is quite different from an earthly land-


a month in the moon

scape for my part as i have just been out i can affirm that the exterior
atmosphere if indeed it exists at all is absolutely unbreathable

     in one word said gertrude gently  you have come to the conclusion
that we are on the moon

i have so little doubt of it replied norbert  that ihave already taken
the most pressing measure for our safety by closing our doors and windows  
 well well there is nothing so dreadful about it after all said ger-
trude cheerfully to reassure the terrified fatima  it was always your
intention to get on the moon if ou could

     the prospect anyhow is far from cheerful said the baronet if it is
true which i am not at all sure about yet one wouldnt mind the fact of
being on the moon  but it is quite another thing to be without air  and
when we think that we owe it all to that imbecile  he added with a furious
look at smith

    the unhappy valet was already sufficiently terror stricken at finding him-
self on the moon and now to be blamed for it in the righteous indignation
of his masterwas quite too much  his knees gave way under him and he
sank in a heap on the ground muttering between his teeth

     smith youre an idiot 

chapter xxvii-a strange country

   when they had somewhat recovered from their first surprise norbert
was assailed with questions

    if i have understood rightly said the doctor you maintain that we
are now breathing the air we brought with us in the observatory

    just so

     and that once this is consumed we shall have none left

     doubtless

     but how in that case are we going to breathe

    how repeated norbert laughing  why we must make our own
air  have we not a supply of chemical products on purpose  by the bye
i must go and overhaul them i am rather anxious to see how we stand as
regards stores  

    followed by the doctor and gertrude the astronomer proceeded through
the hall of telescopes which evidently had not suffered much from its dis-
placement to the store rooms where- he found everything in much better
order than he had expected

    there were a few breakages but nothing of importance they had done
hardly any damage the instruments were intact most of them were fixed
in the ground and the cases of special apparatus were as perfect as the day
the left the workshop

    there were two or three cases of  oxygen respirators calling virgil to
assist norbert opened several of the cases and took them to the laboratory to
put them in working order

    when the reservoirs were filled with gas norbert fastened one on his
back by the leather straps attached to it for the purpose which made the
a month in the moon



thing look like a tin pannier surmounted by a large leather bag this bag
was fastened under the left arm by an appendage which when squeezed by
the elbow expelled a certain quantity of oxygen into a rubber tube the
tube was connected with the nose and mouth of the wearer of the apparatus
and fitted tightly on his face by means of a copper mask furnished with pads
of chamois leather

   thus equipped norbert provided himself with a mariners compass a spy
glass and a rifle and returned to the drawing room

    may i ask you whom you are going to war with asked the baronet
feeling the need of a little diversion from his melancholy mood

    i am only going to explore the surroundings answered norbert
 something is puzzling me and i must find it out i cant see how we can
be on the moon and iu our own observatory at one and the same time the
whole summit of tehbali must have been carried off bodily ill make it
clear however within the next quarter of an hour

   is there any reason why i should not join you in the voyage of dis-
covery asked sir bucephalus

    nothing would give me greater pleasure only you must be equipped
like me-that is to say with a respirator i have just filled five or six vir-
gil will fetch one of them

    may we not come too cried gertrude and her uncle almost simul-
taneously

    i dont think it would be wise answered norbert you shall go
afterwards if we find it quite safe and prudent

    this was agreed to and the baronet hastened to equip himself for the ex-
pedition

     i am fully as curious as you he said to norbert  to ascertain how it
comes about that our observatory is now in the moon  that is headded
quickly  if we are really in the moon

    what  cried norbert you dont mean to say you are still in doubt
about it your doubts will soon be laid to rest now

   so saying the two young men glided through the half opened door and
were gone

   there was not much change apparently in the esplanade they went
along it quickly till they reached the zigzag path down the mountain

   contrary to norberts expectation there was nothing fresh to be seen
here the path wound as formerly down the flank of the peak till it
reached the bed of vitrified glass under the mountain but instead of a plain
stretching beyond there was now a considerable space between the end of the
path and the lower plain

    and another strange thing  instead of facing east as formerly the path
lay now towards the north as shown both by the position of the sun and by
the little pocket compass norbert had with him in fact it was clear that
not only the summit of tehbali but the entire mountain had been forcibly
transported by some irresistible power from one globe to the other

    the heat was intense owing to the almost verticle rays of the sun which
looked much as it did when viewed from the earth with the exception that


a month in the moon

the protuberances on the surface were now more clearly visible to the naked
eye than they were even through the telescope in the observatories of the
earth

   this was a joyful discovery to norbert who was an ardent astronomical
student it was to be explained by the extreme tenuity of the atmosphere
which accounted also for the appearance at midday of countless starry con-
stellations the earthly atmosphere is like a veil between our glasses and
the stars  but the lunar atmosphere leaves free passage to the rays of light
or of heat and unlike that of the earth it lends no azure hue to the sky
which viewed from the moon is black as ink

   not only did our two explorers find themselves in a furnace-like heat but
they also discovered that they were now of an extraordinary lightness they
scarcely felt their feet as they tripped along rather than walked every
moment they were making extraordinary bounds sometimes of four or five
yards while meaning to step aside from some little obstacle such as a stone
or piece of rock

   these gymnastics were so involuntary that each looked at his companion
in astonishment norbert stared at seeing the baronet gamboling along in
this way leaping lightly like a hare and bounding aloft every now and then
as if he were a rubber ball	

   there is something marvelous about this he thought he will
break his neck if he goes on in that extravagant fashion 

   at this moment he himself made a slight backward movement to avoid a
precipice and was to his surprise taken six or seven yards up in the air fall-
ing gently dowrn again on the ground

   the baronet his own gymnastic exercise scarcely over looked at norbert
with displeased surprise at such undignified pranks

    i have it   suddenly thought norbert  gravity is playing us these
tricks it is six times less on the moon than on the earth it follows that
our muscular power is sixfold greater and hence we have become regular
acrobats  

   he could not resist the pleasure of communicating the interesting fact to
the baronet and untied his mask for that purpose 

    well my dear fellow said he do you at last believe you are in the
moon

   to his great surprise there was no reply the baronet did not pay the
least attention to him but gave a tremendous leap over a little rivulet that
the rains had left in the road

    norbert thought at first from his silence and the expression of indifference
on his countenance that sir bucephalus was in the sulks but what had he
done to offend him  he could not conceive what his offense had been

    what an odd idea  thought norbert  such a strange time too to
choose for the sulks what can he be savage with me about  perhaps he
is mad because i laughed af his gambols no matter i shant trouble my
head about it 

   but in the midst of these reflections he suddenly went off into a fit of
laughter-a fit of silent laughter though he had just discovered that he
a month in the moon

i

had only articulated his words without pronouncing them the voice was
not audible or to speak more accurately there was no voice or sound of any
kind on the moon because the tenuity of the atmosphere precluded all
vibration

    poor old bucephalus  and i suspected him of childish sulking
thought norbert  he has taken his mask off twice or thrice perhaps he
has asked vie several questions without getting any reply  and maybe he is
now wondering what is amiss  my side how on earth or rather on the
moon am i to explain matters  there is nothing for it but to wait till we
get back

chapter xxviii-moon struck

   there was nothing to be done under such circumstances but to continue
their silent observations of the strange geological conditions around them

   they had now reached a depth of five thousand feet beneath the observ-
atory and yet this was not half the distance separating them from the plain
the zigzag road ended in a gentle slope which continued to the plain and
did not look difficult of descent although there was no beaten track

   nothing could be more striking than the contrast between the rock of
tehbali and tha said slope the soil of tehbali was of a dull red hue cov-
ered with yellow grass and various kinds of shrubs  that of the slope was
bright green interspersed with glistening mauve and gray streaks of color
without the least trace of vegetation

   there were thus two perfectly distinct zones  the upper one belonging to
tehbali  the other that of the lunar mountain beneath again in a yet
lower region was a series of small craters forming as it were a kind of rug-
ged plateau

   instead of descending the slope norbert chose to skirt it horizontally for
two or three miles round the base of the peak he made a discovery there-
by

   no doubt about it he thought it is clear now that the whole
mountaii of tehbali was taken up aud thrown on its base this seems rather
odd at first sight but given an explosion of subterranean force caused by
the sudden backward recoil of the moon it appears only natural that the
peak should have been uprooted torn like a tooth from its socket out of
the sandy soil that had been its bed once launched into space the solid
nature of the rock would keep it together and by the force of the shock it
was brought near enough to the moon to be attracted by her which is intel-
ligible since our satellite almost touched the earth the conical shape of
the mountain made it inevitable that it should fall on its own base

    it was indeed obliged to fall on its base there is no exception to the
laws of gravity the rule is invariably the same whether it concerns a mag-
netic mountain weighing millions of tons or only cogged dice tehbali re-
sembles the latter inasmuch as once launched into space it was bound to fall
on the heaviest side that is on its base

    now what was it that softened the shock of the fall to a certain extent 


a month in the moon

two causes are evident one was the slight influence of gravity on the
moon  hence our rock alighted as gently as a bird just as i leap now with
such perfect ease the other softening element was this very mountain that
caught us on our way  

   thus did norbert reason to himself there was one point still to clear
up was the mountain a peak or a crater 

    every probability pointed to its being a crater first of all there were
only craters to be seen as far as the eye could reach then it was easy to
see that a crater could hold the magnetic rock of tehbali  but there would
have been a difficulty in the rock settling down atop of another peak

    still skirting the base of tehbali the explorers arrived at length  a
kind of terrace whence they had a much more extended view than from the
other side of the mountain

    they perceived that the lesser craters of the plain gradually diminished
towards the west and south till they reached a sandy hollow region whilst
from the north to the east  the contrary they rose in tiers till they reached
an elevated chain of mountains running in the same direction this circum-
stance together with the characteristic aspect of the chain was like a ray of
light to the young astronomer

    he turned round mechanically to communicate the result of his observa-
tions to sir bucephalus but suddenly remembering it was impossible to make
himself heard took out his memorandum book and rapidly sketching the
country handed it to the baronet with this explanatory note 

     i think we have alighted on the crater of rheticus and that this chain
of mountains is that of the lunar apennines these sandy plains must be
the sea of vapors the sea of tranquillity and the sea of serenity

   having read this note sir bucephalus returned the memorandum to
norbert making vain efforts to speak the young astronomer saw these
attempts and wrote again 

     i am obliged to use a pencil for there is  sound  the moon

    is that so  wrote the baronet in his turn i have spoken to you
several times without a single word in reply  

    the effect of the moon replied norbert  another strange thing
you see that block of stone near your right leg it measures at least two
cubic yards try to lift it and you will see

   sir bucephalus looked incredulously at the enormous block which two
horses could scarcely have moved on earth he stooped down however to
please his companion to his inexpressible surprise the rock moved easily
under the slight pressure of his hand

    at the same instant norbert took his flight and passed over the baronets
head at a height of eight or ten yards coming down again as gracefully as a
bird

     effect of the moon  he smiled

    but although the baronet heard nothing he was not going to be outdone
he took his flight and rose so high that norbert was piqued into a repetition
of his own exploits and so they went on for several minutes each trying to
emulate the other in a series of acrobatic achievements
a month in the moon



   at last the two young men sat down side by side and looked at each other
with a perplexed expression mingled on norberts side with one of amuse-
ment

    i will explain these phenomena to you began the astronomer again
forgetting that he could not make the least sound

   sir bucephalus seeing his lips move turned the most attentive ear in
hopes of hearing but all in vain

   i give it up gesticulated norbert shrugging his shoulders it
would take too long to write it  

   he tried to explain the situation to his friend by a succession of gestures
the baronet looked on in amazement while his companion leaped over enor-
mous obstacles lifted weights that looked colossal and then coming up to
sir bucephalus took hold of him not round the body but as if he had been
a doll by both hands and throwing him up in the air caught him as one
catches a ball

   the baronet did not much care for these liberties 

   no sooner cid norbert pause in his acrobatic feats than his companion did
the same to him with all the while a most serious and offended air which
amused norbert greatly

    it is not without reason that madmen are called lunatics thought the
baronet  can it be possible that only a few hours sojourn on the moon
has had such an effect on a mind like norberts for it is evident that he
has lost his senses and he is as strong as a bull with it all so am i indeed
i have never seen myself in such good form as i am now it must be owing
to the physical education at eton something ahvays remains of such a train-
ing and it only requires opportunity to bring it forth but i trust i am not
going to lose my head like this poor fellow

   he had got so far in his reflections when norbert seized him round the
waist and throwing him over his shoulder like a bundle of feathers ran
with all his might along the terrace formed by the lip of the crater

   the baronet somewhat alarmed and much offended by this exploit
struggled with the energy of despair norbert would not let go he stopped
only at the end of the terrace and set down sir bucephalus who wras crimson
with rage

      i am surprised sir   he tried to say

   but seeing that he was unheard he stopped short the extreme absurdity
of the situation suddenly overcame him and his rage evaporating under
norberts affectionate smile sir bucephalus went off into a peal of laughter
that shook his sides but made not a sound

chapter xxix-the crater of rheticus

   the chief point now said norbert to himself as he sat beside sir
bucephalus on the edge of the terrace formed by the crater  is to ascertain
the condition of the isolating base of our great artificial magnet  if by good
chance it is intact so much the better  we might then have some reason-
able hope of seeing earth again  well  well  we shall soon see  


a month in the moon

   so saying he got upon his feet followed by the baronet and they re-
sumed their exploration of the crater keeping always to the circular summit
that was now capped by the peak of tehbali

   a walk of a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes brought them to a point
exactly opposite but much lower than the observatory on a sudden they
perceived a wide opening in the side of the mountain

   on looking closer norbert saw at once that the opening was in fact an
old cleft in the side of the crater and that it was now closed in at the top as
by a ceiling by the vitrified base of the mountain of tehbali he hailed the
discovery as one likely to settle the point that was now occupying his atten-
tion and at once entered the v shaped cavern sir bucephalus closely follow-
ing in his footsteps

   at first they could distinguish nothing owing to the comparative obscur-
ity but when their eyes got accustomed to the twilight they found themselves
in an immense cavity-none other indeed than the cavity of athe crater of
rheticus it was cup shaped at the bottom and covered over at the top by a
solid arched vault

   in order to make sure of the fact norbert lit some matches he had in his
pocket and held them up as high as-he could the light reflected from the
top proved conclusively that the roof was in very truth t he vitrified glass
base of the mountain of tehbali that had thus capped the lunar crater

    there was so little doubt about it that even the baronet was struck by it
 upon my word   he cried  the whole mountain is intact and sits on
the top of the crater just like a large lump of sugar  

    marvelous to relate norbert heard this exclamation quite distinctly not-
withstanding that it had been uttered from behind a copper mask 

   there was only one possible explanation of the phenomenon

     turn off the tap of your respirator said norbert setting the example
 we have as much air here as we want  

    hurrah   shouted sir bucephalus  i am very glad to give up my
feeding bottle  but how do you account for the fact that we can only talk
and breathe by fits and starts in this absurd country   

    quite easily replied norbert laughing  dont you see that we are
in an air cavern    making a rapid mental calculation he added    this
cavern is quite a thousand or twelve hundred yards in diameter and almost
as deep  this gives us a provision of several millions of inches of air   

    really  well i do call this a good find  it is worth more than a
diamond mine  what a comfort it is at last to be able to draw a good
breath  

   yes answered norbert but we must husband our riches they
will not be inexhaustible

    why on earth or rather in the moon said the baronet  is this crater
the sole storehouse of breathable air   

     by the same reason that accounts for our presence here and also con-
firms my theory of the matter answered norbert the air here is not
proper to the moon it is terrestrial air collected by the mocn when like a
ball rolling in flour she rolled into our atmosphere this crater had just
a month in the moon



filled with air when it was suddenly capped that is to say corked up by the
rock of tehbali it is this modicum of earths air that we are now breathing  

   in that case said the baronet pensively  we must indeed be sparing
of this unexpected treasure  

    not only sparing of it but we must prevent its escaping by the opening
that gave us ingress  we had better go back to the observatory as quickly
as possible for tools to build it up tight else the air will escape little by little  

   this wise advice was at once put into practice

   the two explorers resumed their masks and were turning back to the
opening when norbert proposed an amendment

    there is not an instant to lose he said  for each minute costs us
hundreds of gallons of air why need we both go back  one of us could
fetch what tools we shall want whilst the other remains here and sets to work
at once

   thats true replied sir bucephalus do you go then my dear
fellow since you know exactly what is needed but what can i do in your
absence  

    you can gather together a lot of stones wherewith to make a wall and
close up the opening when i come back

    very well there is no lack of stones here you shall have a good
heap here on your return i promise

   satisfied with this assurance norbert bounded off to the observatory and
was there in a few minutes

   as soon as they all heard the news every one wanted to join the expedi-
tion the doctor virgil smith fatima and even gertrude were all anxious
to become assistant masons

   smith had laid out a splendid lunch for the explorers on their return
but it was settled to postpone the repast for another hour as norbert did not
think it would take longer to close the opening

   he had already given his instructions to virgil who had hurried off to
the storeroom in search of a shovel a trowel a sack of cement and a barrel
of water

   meanwhile all prepared for the adventure by providing themselves with
oxygen respirators and norbert warned his companions of the singular phe-
nomena that awaited them outside

   brief s countenance lengthened considerably when he heard that he was
about to be condemned to absolute silence

   gertrude took it all in her usual courageous way

    what is that majestic planet that has appeared since your departure 
she asked going to the window to point out to norbert a large pale white
crescent in the heavens similar in appearance to the new moon when viewed
from the earth only four times as large

   that is our country the earth  he replied we shall have the
pleasure of constantly seeing her for she is the great time piece of the lunar
world  she is always present in the heavens and in this hemisphere she is
visible all day and all night  

   the earth said gertrude with a sigh to think that my poor


a month in the moon

darling father is there so far from us exposed to the horrors of a siege and
little dreaming that his daughter has been exiled to this place   

   they went out on the esplanade and for the first few minutes there was
some confusion norbert had warned them of the new conditions they might
expect to find outside  but the two servants had failed to take in all his ex-
planations their abnormal lightness was a great trouble to them they
conducted themselves as if seized with an acute nervous fever

   virgil wishing to look over the edge of the esplanade was carried by his
own impetus to a distance of forty yards at least

    this will be my death   he thought as he flew through space  or
at all events i shall be dreadfully hurt   he continued picking himself up
most carefully when he had reached the ground

   no such thing  he was not even bruised 

   as he turned round in amazement to measure the distance which he had
traversed a tolerably heavy mass came flying toward him it was smith
falling off the esplanade in his turn led by the force of example probably
he fell atop of virgil 

    this fellow will smash me  thought virgil but smith proved as
light as a feather and did no harm whatever

   this experience taught them to moderate their movements in proportion
to the work to be done they now hastened to join the others and were
soon at the mouth of the cavern

chapter xxx-a strange intrusion

   here a painful surprise awaited them the baronet was not there
although a large heap of stones attested the ardor with which he must have
worked

   norbert thinking that he might have gone to get a few mouthfuls of
fresh air in the crater penetrated further in calling him loudly

   the subterranean echoes alone replied

   considerably alarmed he lit several matches in succession and began
an exploration of the hole but he had not gone ten paces before the useless-
ness of the proceeding came home to him

    the hollow interior of the crater descended in a gentle slope so that there
was no fear of a dangerous fall on the other hand sir bucephalus could
not have ventured on a useless exploration without a light

   it seemed therefore certain that he was not in the crater and he must
in all probability have been tempted to visit one of the neighboring valleys

    sir bucephalus is not there said norbert to smith who had followed
him anxiousty  you had better go and see if you can find him meanwhile
we will commence work here for there is not a minute to lose and every
instants delay costs us much precious air

   smith obeyed and the rest set to work vigorously

   virgil had already deposited the water and cement in a hole dug with the
shovel and mixing the cement he now laid it on the wall that was rapidly
rising under norberts hands the doctor picked up the stones and ger-
a month in the moon



trude and fatima passed them with a hearty laugh at their own unaccustomed
strength

    look said gertrude holding out a rock that would have weighed a
ton on the earth  is this little stone of any use to you  

   the work proceeded as rapidly as if titans were the builders

   in a few minutes the wall reached to the foot of tehbali and as the
plaster solidified at once on account of the extreme dryness their task was
completed

   smith came back then and signified by heart broken gestures that he had
not found the baronet

    after an instants reflection norbert resolved to give the signal to return
to the observatory

   perhaps he thought  sir bucephalus may have gone by another
route or he may be back soon 

   there was no baronet to be seen in the drawing room as they had hoped
but there were traces of his appetite the lunch left on the table was half
gone cold meat ham wine biscuits and dessert had all been laid under
contribution

   in truth sir bucephalus could not have eaten all that had disappeared
he fnust have taken some of it away with him

     i dare say said the doctor  that finding something interesting at the
foot of the mountain he hurried back to it at once

   the explanation seemed plausible and was accepted by the company in
default of any other solution they took their seats at table without further
delay

    well we are glad to have found a good supply of air in that cave
said the doctor when he had somewhat satisfied his appetite  but how
will you manage to utilize it my dear mauny now that like another eolus
you have succeeded in imprisoning it in your cavern  do you intend to send
us there for change of air now aud then just as i used to pack my patients off
to monte carlo in those happy days when i did not practise on the moon 
or do you mean to put the air into barrels and transport it here 

   my plan is much simpler answered norbert you know that i
began by boring a well down the middle of the mountain if the bottom of
the well is put into communication with the air reservoir and a ventilator
fitted to one of these windows the whole of the observatory will have a suffi-
cient supply

    it is a good idea but are you not afraid of being too generous with
that precious air  would it not be more prudent to restrain the supply to
what is absolutely necessary by passing it through rubber or leaden tube fur-
nished with a tap  the tube would have to be of a considerable length
though and probably you have not got such a thing in store

   we have all that we require replied norbert

     there has not been much to complain of hitherto   said the doctor
 but it is really painful not to be able to exchange ones thoughts outside
this observatory  a bright idea occurred to me a little while ago why
shouldnt we learn the deaf and dumb language 


a month in the moon

    where shall we find its alphabet said norbert  i own that i never
thought of providing that and perhaps the omission was a mistake on my
part  

    perhaps we can devise a substitute rejoined the doctor  i used to
know it pretty well once upon a time and it is much easier than is generally
supposed one has only to remember the conventional finger signs that stand
for the twenty four letters of the alphabet it is much easier for us than for
poor children who have never had their sight or hearing and do not kncw
their letters see  this is how the letter a is shown   

   the doctor proceeded to teach them all the other letters of the alphabet
in succession he took out his note book and drew the signs on it in pencil

    i dont know how it is he resumed  but it is a curious fact that a
little thing of this sort sometimes remains for years in a corner of the memory
much like a bundle of letters in an old drawer and is ready for use when oc-
casion offers we must have fresh signs if i have forgotten any  

   they all proved good pupils and gesticulated in praiseworthy concert
norbert glancing at virgil thought that even he was trying to learn the
mute language the soldier stood on the threshold of the office gesticulating
wildly

   but on a sudden his master saw that his signs were genuine attempts to
attract notice he was blinking his eyes and making despairing gestures
from behind gertrudes chair as if to intimate to his master that he had
something serious and special to communicate to him in private and as soon
as possible

   norbert gave him a look to show that he understood and left the table
soon after pretending that he had to take the time of a chronometer iu the
hall of telescopes

    there are thieves here sir virgil whispered

     thieves  what do you mean   

    i have just found the store room quite demolished the canned goods
biscuits sugar coffee everything is gone  we have been robbed of tons
everything is upset the drawers left open and the cases empty on the floor
one would think a troop of arabs must have been there and it was all
done while we were at the foot of the peak for i was the last to leave the
storeroom with a barrel of water and i find it in this state on my return   

     might it not have been done by sir bucephalus   

   sir bucephalus he couldnt have carried off all that is missing  it
must have been the work of eight or ten men depend upon it besides sir
bucephalus has not been in i think and he has not touched the lunch
table  

   r what makes you think so  

    everything the way in which the ham is cut the meats hacked about
so unlike the orderly methodical habits of the english we servants notice
these little matters and then he has a good appetite certainly  but he
could not have eaten such a lot besides his dinner napkin has not been un-
folded and his plate is quite clean no no believe me sir sir bucephalus
has not been in
a month in the moon



      but what do you infer  

    i dont know i can only think that thieves have been here within the
last hour or half hour and they have carried off not only an enormous quantity
of provisions but also-

    what

     arms and ammunition  my rifle which stood behind the door of the
storeroom and the doctors rifle that was hanging up in the drawing room
he has not noticed its absence but i did

chapter xxxi-only catalepsy

    after ascertaining the state of things in the storeroom and finding that
virgil had ki no wise exaggerated norbert called briet into the hall of tel-
escopes to take counsel with him and his faithful servant

   who were those strange thieves that they should pounce upon the pro-
visions and leave the baronets splendid plate untouched that circum-
stance alone seemed to point to the probability of the theft having been com-
mitted by an animal or a troop of unknown animals rather than by a human
being

   on the other hand the disappearance of the firearms must haye been the
work of intelligent though mischievous beings anyhow it was most im-
portant to find out the truth and also to organize a search party for the
bafonet

    as the expedition had its dangers it was settled that gertrude and fatima
should be left behind in charge of smith the doctor and virgil armed to
the teeth accompanied norbert

    the model valet was told of this decision and strictly enjoined not to dis-
quiet the ladies left to his protection as they were not to know the reason of
the sortie he was however to lock the door and to have loaded firearms
at hand and not to admit any one without good cause

   having taken these precautions our three explorers hastened to equip
themselves for the adventure filled their breechloaders with explosive bullets
and put on their respirators then they bid good by to gertrude under pre-
text of going out to look for the baronet

    f  where shall we begin f   asked the doctor

     i am inclined to go towards the sea of serenity replied norbert

    the sea   cried fatima clapping her hands  oh how i should like
to see it and above all to bathe in it as at suakim  

    dont be in such a hurry fatima said norbert  there is no water
in this sea  

    no water in a sea

    no my child  there is not a drop on the whole surface of the moon
nor even in its atmosphere we should suffer terribly from thirst if we had
not a good supply in store which saves us at least that torment as to the
sea of which i speak it is like all the others in this wrorld simply a sandy
plain 

    then why call them seas asked gertrude


a month in the moon

      because the first astronomers who discovered them a hundred and fifty
or two hundred years ago took them for seas as in conformation they much
resemble the probable appearance of the beds of our oceans supposing the waters
had dried up but i will tell you more about it on our return as i shall cer-
tainly take the opportunity of studying the question more closely than has
yet been done

     well go quickly in that case said gertrude  or you will be overtaken
by night  for it must now be two or three oclock in the afternoon i cant
tell exactly because all our clocks and watches have stopped

    there is no fear of night coming said norbert laughing  unless i
am very much out in my calculations we can look forward to something like
two hundred and sixty four hours of daylight  

     is it possible  are the days so long as that in the moon 

   they last at least fourteen times twenty four hours there are only
twelve days throughout the lunar year

    and are we not to sleep during all that period  asked fatima in dis-
may

     nothing prevents our sleeping in fact we must make a point of having
fixed hours for repose on account of our terrestrial habits we must sleep
in the day time that is all  

     and will the nights when they come be equally long 

    quite during fourteen times twenty four hours we shall only have
the light of the stars and of the earth

     how strange it will be  cried fatima

     not stranger than the long polar nights and days iti the arctic regions
of the terrestrial globe but meanwhile we must proceed to our exploration
come doctor let us start virgil have you the maps compass barometers
and all necessaries  

   yes sir

    one word more implored the doctor  how will the barometer be-
have here   

     jut as it does on earth or nearly so that enables us tc keep our pro-
vision of air and go about with impunity in the rarefied atmosphere of the
moon

    if it is so rarefied how is it that the barometric tension is the same as
that to which we are used   

    the lunar atmosphere is much higher than that of the earth that ac-
cords with the lesser intensity of the weight of the surface of this world and
explains how it is that the lunar atmosphere is invisible from the earth all
the facts fit in but enough  let us go now once for all

    they went down the road and the slope of the great crater and were soon
in the plain strewn with smaller volcanoes they crossed it without stopping
and in going towards the southwest came before long to the edge of a vast
sandy bed

   it extended to the horizon and as the young astronomer had foreseen
was exactly like the sahara  with the exception however that noeasis was
visible and the solar light was more intense than in the african desert
a month in the moon

i

    had there been a single individual alive or dead throughout this vast ex-
panse he woucl have been seen ten leagues off but not the least vestige of
animate or inanimate life disturbed the solitude

      iet us go back and look in the apennines   wrote norbert passing his
note book to his companions

   the great chain of mountains stretched from northwest to west it was
composed of ranges of peaks rising to the height of ten thousand feet above the
sea of serenity mauny dr briet and virgil accomplished the first part
of the ascent in less than an hour it was not very easy walking but the
three travelers explored it all thoroughly climbing manfully terrace after
terrace until at length they stood on a summit whence they commanded a
view of both slopes quite sixty leagues in extent

   vainly did they sweep the immense circle with their glasses the soli-
tude was as complete as the bottom of the dried up lunar ocean

   norbert had just lowered the glass and was about to give the signal for
return when his attention was caught by a pyramidal rock surmounting the
height on which he stood he went up to it it had evidently been
placed there by a human hand

   it was rough but was wedged carefully in and propped up with stones to
prevent it rocking and to obviate all doubt as to its origin the following
inscription dene with a knife was to be seen on one side 

sir bucephalus coghill

the first man
that ever ceimbed these
mountains

    well to be sure  said norbert laughing as he pointed out the in-
scription to the doctor it was to write his name here then that the
baronet gave vis all the slip we shall find him safe and sound depend upon
it when we return who would have accused him of such a freak of
vanity   

   with their minds at rest the three explorers set off homeward down a new
road it was  kind of deep gorge that led straight to the crater of rheticus
and was probably the bed of some ancient torrent that had forced its way to
the sea

   it was shady and cool and best of all they could actually hear the sound
of their own footsteps which showed that they must have hit upon a stratum
of air

   norbert hastened to verify the fact by taking off his oxygen respirator
but he had to put it on again quickly the floating modicum of air was not
of sufficient density to suffice for animal life

   on the other hand there was no trace of vegetable existence the
stratum of air was probably a remnant of the earths atmosphere that had
been imprisoned in these depths so reasoned norbert

   the ancient torrent skirted the base of rheticus and consequently that
also of tehbali and brought them back to the observatory on the opposite
side from that by which they had left it they seized the opportunity of
inspecting that part of the peak


a month in the moon

   as they passed along the road that ran past the tomb of the dwarf of
rhadameh a most unexpected sight met their eyes

   the stone closing the tomb had fallen down and the corpse lay exposed to
view in the hollow of the rock where it had been deposited

   norbert and virgil instinctively turned away from the sight and began to
lift up the stone in order to replace it but the doctor went up to the body
and examined it with scientific curiosity all at once he stooped took the
dead mans hand and looked intently at a red patch on it that appeared to
have been the effect of the suns heat

   turning back to his companions and seeing that they was evidently sur-
prised the doctor wrote on a page of his note book

    a corpse burned by the sun  such a thing was never yet seen  it is
too preposterous even in the moon   

   norbert was aware of the physiological truth that there is no more certain
sign of death than the fact that the skin is insensible to burning

   the doctor took up his stethoscope and put it to the dead mans chest

   alas  he suddenly bethought himself that there was no sound on the
moon and therefore the absence of all noise in the heart was no proof so
he hastened to uncover the wizened wrist and felt it with the palm of his
own hand

   there was a very feeble pulsation scarcely perceptible but still unmis-
takable

   before norbert and virgil who stood by lost in amazement could make
out what the doctor was about he caught up the dwarf as if he had been
a baby and ran off with him to the observatory

   the doctor passed quickly through the hall of motors and rushing to
his room laid the dwarf on his own bed and actually went to work to scrub
him vigorously from head to foot with a clothes brush

   at the same time he inflated the lungs of the supposed corpse by blowing
down a silver tube which he had taken out of his surgical ease and inserted
in kaddours mouth having first with his forceps pulled forward the singu-
larly shriveled tongue

   norbert saw the dwarf slowly coming back to life his breathing be-
came stronger and he twisted and turned coughed and sneezed under the
brisk manipulation of the brush which left him red as a boiled lobster

   at last he opened his eyes and faintly murmured in french 

    something to drink

   norbert wondered if he were in a dream yet there was no room for
doubt there before his very eyes was the dwarf of rhadameh who had
been buried fifteen days back now all alive speaking breathing like any one
else 

   the doctor was too busy to be spoken to after he had well rubbed his
patient he made him breathe pure oxygen and poured half a glass of wine
down his throat exhausted with his hard work the worthy man then
swallowed a bumper himself and wiped his forehead with a self satisfied air

   at last cried norbert no longer able to suppress his impatience

  will you explain this mystery   
a month in the moon



   explain it nothing simpler said the doctor laughing  this is
a case of catalepsy i have long known that certain indian jugglers and
fakirs could do it but i have never before had an opportunity of witnessing
the phenomenon i am very glad to have seen it you are witness that the
fellow bore all the appearance of death and was buried for-how long   

      thirteen days unless i mistake  

    that is less than the fakir of ceylon mentioned by dr sterk as having
been buried for six months  

    six months or six days is much the same said norbert  for the phe-
nomenon is as extraordinary in the one case as the other how is it ac-
counted for

    by a most simple process of progression the indian fakirs and jug-
glers begin by accustoming themselves to live with the minimum of vital force
through their habit of remaining motionless for long periods of time they
practise holding their breath  they live in boxes that are more or less her-
metically sealed first for hours then for days and finally for weeks or
months

    more than that they manage to fill their stomach as if it were a store-
room with atmospheric air that they can afterward pass into their lungs by
minute doses at a time to effect this the string of their tongue is cut so
that they can turn it back and close their windpipe at will they know how
to hypnotize themselves by looking fixedly at the top of their nose  and by
contracting the thoracic muscles they can so stop the movement of the heart
that it is imperceptible they also have poisons in their possession that are
unknown to the european pharmacy and that can produce all the aforesaid
effects instantaneously you see how easily all these combined agents can
simulate the appearance of death

   norbert listened to these explanations with deep interest but his interest
was nothing compared to that of kaddour he was quite himself again and
was now taking in with wide open eyes and ears every wtord of the doctor

   the latter at last perceived this and dropped the subject for the present
reserving it for the drawing room when the person principally concerned
should not be at hand

    well my boy he said patting the dwarf on the head affectionately
and professionally   we are certainly much better but there must be no
more of these pranks because they would not answer nor take us in now 
virgil will give you a cup of soup presently with a glass of claret after
that you must take a nap and wake up quite well

   really to hear the doctor speak one would have thought that he was
addressing the most virtuous and charming patient instead of a wicked de-
formity who had barely escaped a well merited capital sentence by feigning
to poison himself but such is the strength of the medical sense of what is
fitting in the practice of the profession that every other consideration is lost
in the single minded care for the patient and rich or poor honest man or
criminal are all one in their eyes so long as they need a doctor

   and such is the strength of example that every one in the observatory
acted likewise they all forgot the crimes of kaddour and only looked


uncle benjamins past

upon him first as a singular phenomenon then after some hours had passed
by as a brother in misfortune another exile from earth

   every one hastened to show him little attentions as soon as he was able to
rise and go into the hall of telescopes where a hammock was slung for him

   the dwarf was morosely silent at first and did not apparently appreciate
their kindness the doctor alone seemed to find grace in his eyes and he
appeared glad to hear his voice

   but when he saw that the genial sympathy was real and not affected-
when he understood that his crimes were forgiven and that he was treated
like a friend-he was so overcome at last by so much generosity that one day
he gave proof of the fact by bursting into tears

   this proved the signal for a complete change in his manners and conduct
he did not speak any more but his old expression of morose defiance gave
place to oue of sadness of almost gentleness it was evident that a chord
had been touched in that hard heart

tells how fate played into lovers hands-mr dobleys flight from fancied peril lands him
at the very feet of nemesis-the good an ill wind blew

n ow larry dont try to argue this matter with me i know what is
best for you marriage and ruin are sjmonymous the prospect
is alluring no doubt but realization is worse than long contracts and a
steadily falling market what you call  love  is merely a sort of brain fever
that perturbs the senses and obscures reason it lasts only a few months
marriage cures it then you inevitably hate the medicine-your wife

    but my dear uncle you and i both know lots of couples who have for
many years lived happily together

   no they have heroically endured each other their supposed happi-
ness is a delusion matrimonys martyrs do not always advertise themselves
do you suppose a man whose wifes extravagance has brought him to the
verge of bankruptcy is going to proclaim to his creditors his precarious posi-
tion  do you imagine your neighbor who has perhaps had a nine inch
dinner plate cracked on his skull by the gentle partner of his bosom will
come down town and tell you about it  

    nelly would neither be extravagant nor crack plates on my skull you
would know that if you were acquainted with her

    why no i wouldnt how could i be sure of such a thing her ap-
pearance might encourage a sanguine person to hope that her inherent capa-
city for mischief might not take those particular forms of manifestation but
the finite mind is impotent when it attempts to forecast feminine possibilities
you dont want to take any such chances

    but i do i would marry nellie in the face of every imaginable risk
it would break my heart to give her up
uncle benjamins past



      that remark only shows the severity of your fever-nothing more
 why should you marry  rnow at all events you are in receipt of a good
 income as manager of my business  will be admitted to a junior partnership
 next year if you go on as well as you have been doing  and when i die you
 will be dobley  co then if you have another attack of the fever you
 will be in a position to humor expensive and hazardous whims and if you are
 prudent meanwhile will be able to make such rational selection of a mrs
 chester as would be impossible now  

      i dont see why i should risk is inherent in the venture at any time
 -according to rou  

      so it is  so it is my boy the risk is always there  but i have thought
 of a way in which it may be minimized you were with me last week when
 i bought a horse did i take a young unbroken untried animal simply on
 its good looks  i should say not i bought one that had an established
 record and a good report from the preceding owner for soundness and gentle
 disposition i also it is true got a guarantee from the seller and that is
 something nobody can give with a wife  but barring that the principle is the
 same instead of marrying this girl you have your mind set on now let
 some other fellow take that risk keep an eye on her and see how she turns
 out what sort of a wife she makes if she proves sound capable free from
 vice you will be comparatively safe in marrying her when he dies

    the young mans face reddened with indignation he could not trust
 himself to reply but springing up from his chair rushed out of the little
 private office in which he had been holding this conversation with his uncle
 the old gentleman mr benjamin dobley was a merchant in coffees teas
 and sugar  a stout little man smoothly shaven bald very precise in his
 ways fixed in his notions and rich a more confirmed misogamist than he
 did not live and when his nephew lawrence chester-for whom he had a
 truly paternal regard-evinced a desire to plunge into what he deemed the
 perilous sea of matrimony he naturally did his best to dissuade the rash
 young man but his really kind intent did not seem to make his opposition
 seem any the less a hardship to larry as for his atrocious theory for con-
 - servation of the maximum of approximate safety in marrying it will be
 readily imagined that larry said nothing about it in his interview a few hours
 later with his fiancee miss nelly mcbride 

     it had been fully understood between the young people that mr dobleys
 consent to their marriage was almost an essential larry who was of an in-
 dependent and somewhat impetuous disposition and too deeply in love to be
 judicious would have married at once taking all possible risks of his uncles
 serious displeasure but nelly was more prudent and would not consent to
 such a rash proceeding

     no dear she argued you might as you say procure other em-
 ployment-though in these dull times the chances are against you but
 think how long  t would be in a strange place before you could gain such a
 position as you have now and perhaps you might never attain such pros-
 pects as are now almost a certainty for you it might doom you to a life
 time of struggling if we were to marry in defiance of your uncle i will wait


uncle benjamins past

for you a year-five years-ten if necessary  i will never marry anybody
else but we must not antagonize uncle benjamin

    i believe your business sense is better than mine my darling but i love
you so that throwing away the best years of our lives just to humor an old
mans whim is very hard

   yes it is hard what can have made him so bitter against marriage
i suppose he never was in love himself  

   uncle benjamin in love  it would be almost as easy to imagine him
with wings oh no the popular notion that every old bachelor has a
love romance rankling in his heart does not apply to uncle benjamin he is
so just because he was made that way and he has been confirmed no
doubt by observation of unhappy marriages from particular instances of
undesirable wives he has generalized that all women are alike  

    but i would not ruin you uarry i am not extravagant

    i dont doubt that and i do not think you are likely to break nine inch
dinner plates on my skull

  oh uarry  did he say i would do that wha an awful old
man  

    he didnt exactly affirm that you would do it but suggested it as among
the possibilities

    im sure he would never say such a horrid thing if he knew me

    no of course he wouldnt but he does not know you and never
will if he can help it

   nelly cogitated a few moments and then asked   did you tell him
whom you proposed to marry 

     no he never gave me a chance mentioning marriage to him was
like shaking a red flag at a bull  it set him off at once

    youre sure you did not mention my name

    i believe i spoke of you as nelly that was all

     then i shall make the acquaintance of his ursine hig hness and try if
i cannot tame him

    how will you get at him  

    your note yesterday came in one of your uncles business envelopes
and mother noticing it recalled that her dearest confidential friend when she
was a school girl was aurelia ann dobley they had not met she said in
twenty years and she wondered if this benjamin dobley could be related to
her aurelia ann

    related  why shes his sister

     so i imagined  

    she keeps house for him and is an old maid with a will of her own and
quite free in declaring it but one of the kindest hearted and best women

alive but i hardly see- 

    you will in a minute mother will do anything i say i intend that
she shall call upon your aunt aurelia ann renew their old friendship and
if possible procure an invitation for me to remain here in new york with
your aunt for a fortnight instead of going back home to beverly with
mother im not through sightseeing yet you know
uncle benjamins past



   splendid  i can come up to see you every evening and-

    indeed you will do nothing of the sort it must not even be suspected
that we are acquainted until i make up my mind upon aunt aurelias pro-
bable attitude and i must caution mother not to mention your name give
me two weeks chance at uncle benjamin and as we say up in yankeeland
ill either make a spoon or spoil a horn its true he may only abhor
me as a schemer when he finds out but even at that he couldnt think anj-
worse of me than that i would break plates on your skull  

i   

   as lawrence said nothing more about getting married uncle benjamin
erroneously supposed the idea abandoned and rather plumed himself secretly
upon his success in persuading relinquishment of the pernicious purpose

    several days after that matter had been so satisfactorily disposed of uncle
benjamin settled himself after luncheon in the depths of the big morocco lined
chair in his private office for his customary siesta when one of the clerks
brought him word that a lady who announced herself as  mrs dobley
was in the store and desired to see him

    who  he shouted sitting bolt upright and and very wide awake in an
instant

    mrs dobley sir was the name she gave

    nonsense  its miss dobley my sister though he wondered why she
had come to the store

    oh no sir i know miss dobley by sight this is a tall fine looking
woman richly dressed a blonde- 

    keep her out  i wont see her  send her away  tell her i wont

be back in a year-that itn dead-anything- cried uncle benjamin

waving his hands as if to keep off a specter but by the time the clerk had
reached the door his fear gave him a new inspiration and he called  no
hold on  that wouldnt do shed force her way in anyhow she must be
let in but delay her  keep her out a few minutes-make some excuse 

   the clerk went out closing the door behind him in an instant uncle
benjamin jumped to his feet snatched up his hat slapped it on the back of
his head and sprang to the back window cautiously he raised the sash and
peered out the stone paved area was a good twelve feet below on a level
with the cellar floor too far for him to risk jumping but if he could get
down there and into the cellar he might escape into the street while she was
being ushered into the empty office a new coil of rope-procured to repair a
hoistway-lay in one corner of the office he dragged it out cut the lash-
ings made one end fast to a safe handle and tossed the rest of it out of the
window in another half minute he had gone down it hand under hand
like an acrobat here he found himself in a trap the iron shutters of the
cellar windows were closed and though he kicked at them in frenzy he could
not make himself heard by the porters who were no doubt in the store above
and every moment he dreaded to see that womans head thrust out of the
window above him looking about almost in despair he caught sight of the
window of a banana cellar open for the ventilation of the ripening fruit and
plunged into it


uncle benjamins past

   the italian proprietor startled by his advent uttered a cry of alarm and
then an exclamation of profound astonishment as he recognized his dignified
and wealthy neighbor the coffee merchant but uncle benjamin heeded him
not he paused not an instant for explanation or apology but dashed
through to the front steps up them to the street around the corner to the
nearest hack stand and thence had himself swiftly carried home

   the amazement of the clerk when he eventually showed the lady into
the vacated office is not to be described as for  mrs dob ey she seemed
more indignant than surprised that which most overwhelmed the young
man-his employer having been able to climb out of the window and down
the rope--did not seem to impress her as remarkable her attention was con-
centrated upon the fact that he had taken flight rather than meet her

   tell him she said as she turned to go that mrs dobley is not a
woman to be treated with such disrespect and will come again  

   those last three words she uttered in a very awful tone of voice as the
clerk duly reported to lawrence when he came in a few minutes later

   larry was almost stunned so there was a mrs dobley  a dreadful
mrs dobley whom uncle benjamin would risk his neck to avoid

   he had a past and nobody had ever suspected it 

	c	j	js	sfc

   uncle benjamins flight had been instinctive quite natural-he said to
himself-as anybody knowing the circumstances would admit but he
could not go on like that climbing out of the back window every time that
woman raided his office and she might take it into her head to hunt him
up at his home aurelia would have to be put upon her guard not to admit
her and aurelia would probably ask questions oh what a bother it
all was  why not go away to europe for a year or two  that was worth
thinking of

   aurelia ann was a little alarmed by his coming home at such an unusual
hour but he told her

    i do not feel quite as well as usual  it is nothing serious however all
i want is a good rest i am going up to bed at once and must not be dis-
turbed no matter who comes

   the only person who called to see him during the evening was law-
rence who was exceedingly anxious to have an interview but aunt aurelia
dutifully barred the way

    he did not feel well she said  and has gone to bed leaving word
that he would not see anybody tonight so there is no use talking any
business you have must wait until morning

   the young man accepted his dismissal demurely but went away chuckling
internally

   uncle benjamin slept badly and arose later than usual he had put on
dressing gown and slippers left his room to go down to breakfast and was
approaching the head of the stairs when he heard the voice of his sister from
the story below saying to some one 

    my brother will be down soon it is past his usual hour and he-

   whatever else she said he could not hear for she had passed into the
uncle benjamins past	 

        parlor accompanying a lady the train of -whose gown he could just barely

          see

            great heavens  he exclaimed his hair rising in terror she has
        followed me jiere already  

           again the mad impulse to flight overcame him he darted back into his
        room aud almost immediately emerged wearing shoes and a hat putting on a
        coat as he came forth down the stairs he did not dare to venture for the
        parlor door wras open but above at this hour there could be nobody
        rapidly he ascended to the attic and up a steep flight of steps leading to the
        scuttle  in another minute he stood free on the roof

           here he had to pause a moment to get his bearings aud remember which
        house from this unfamiliar point of view was that of his friend jack roberts
        with whom he proposed to take refuge it was the fifth to his right one
        intervening roof was almost his own height above the general level under
        ordinary circumstances it would have seemed an insurmountable obstacle
        now he did not mind it in the least how he scrambled up on it he did
        not even notice at that superior elevation he looked ahead and saw on the
        roof that was his destination a girl hanging out clothes to dry behind her
        the entrance to an attic stairway stood open and he uttered a shout of joy

            the girl turned at the sound of his voice and seeing a strange mau leap
        down from the high roof and run toward her gave a frightened shriek
        uncle benjamin paid no attention to her but plunged into the open door-
        way and down the stairs pursued by her cries of thieves  help 

             roberts  roberts  he cried as he hurried down to the parlor floor
        hello what is it why dobley where in thunder do you come
        from exclaimed the astonished roberts emerging from the breakfast
        room back of theparlors with the morning paper in his hand

            from the roof call off that girl tell her to shut up ill explain
        directly stop tier first for heavens sake  

           roberts ran up stairs shouting shut up and uncle benjamiu out
       of breath dizzy and trembling with excitement and fatigue staggered into
       the dining room to find for himself a glass of water the house was almost
       as familiar to him as his own for jack roberts and he had been chums
       for years and many a game of poker he had played in that back room

            standing at the sideboard he had just filled a glass and raised it to his
        lips when a feminine voice behind him exclaimed 

            why benjy 

            he dropped the glass and spun around on his heel as upon apivot to face
        the woman who had just entered from the parlor at sight of her with a
        cry of despair he sank unconscious to the floor

           the lady was looking down at him and laughing when mr roberts re-
       turned

            oh jack   she cried  this is too funny for anything heres an
        ex husband turned up that i had quite forgotten

           the deuce   he exclaimed  do you mean to say youve ever been
        married to my old friend ben dobley   

            yes he was m second he came after saunders and before butler

i


uncle benjamins past

and butler preceded you you know we only lived together a couple of
months or maybe three i dont remember exactly then he got miffed at
some little thing and ran away i got a divorce on the ground of abandon-
ment and never saw or heard of him since until now

   i beg your pardon interpolated a voice at the door  im looking
for my uncle  

    oh  come in lawrence you followed his trail i suppose

    yes

   mr and mrs roberts while talking had tried to revive the little man
but unsuccessfully and it was deemed best to take him home

   when uncle benjamin recovered his senses he was lying upon a sofa in
his ownparlor with aurelia ann holding an ammonia bottle to his nose an
unknown but very pretty girl dabbling cologne on his brow larry fanning
him and a tall imposing blonde woman looking on sympathetically

   what on earth is the matter with you brother benjamin demanded
aurelia ann   what possessed you to go rampaging over the roof to rob-
erts at this time in the morning   

   i did go to roberts eh he responded feebly  i thought i did
but the impression seemed to run into a sort of nightmare toward the end i

thought i saw-  he stopped abruptly

    you saw mrs roberts said larry  i was introduced to her mr
roberts only got home with her last night from chicago where they were
married	

   uncle benjamin sat up with a bewildered but happier look on his face
exclaiming  shes jacks wife now then why did she come to the store
yesterday and call herself mrs dobley 

    excuse me interposed the strange lady  it was i who called i am
mrs dobley the wife of your brother david come all the way from iowa to
visit you only to have you flee from me as if i were a pestilence

    oh  my dear sister  do not think so i implore you you are very
welcome but there were certain circumstances-i cannot explain-but i
thought you were quite another person and this morning when i caught a

glimpse only of you entering the parlor with my sister i--

   you caught no such glimpse benjamin interrupted aurelia ann
you were already sprinting over the roofs when mrs dobley arrived
the lady you saw with me was miss mcbride and she waved her hand
toward the pretty girl as a sort of informal introduction

   nelly said larry in a meaning undertone close to his uncles ear
oh exclaimed uncle benjamin comprehendingly he looked
sharply at her hesitated and then with a little half smile drawing larry
down to him whispered 

      i will give my consent on one condition  

   name it

   that you dont let this story get out on the street

   agreed

   then-god bless you my children

 the mutiny on the flying cloud

thrilling experiences among the islands of the western pacific-the hostage chosen by the
pirates to coerce the first mate-what befell when the malays attacked
the stockade on refuge island

synopsis of chapters previously published

    the clipper ship fljung cloud captain blake commanding is en route between new york
and australia with seven passengers dr henderson his wife little child lucy and his wifes
sister sibyl stanley also mr grant a civil engineer with his wife and seven year old son percy
after crossing the line the chief mate bryce is lost overboard and ned wilson scarcely twenty
is advanced to the post while robert manners who is no older is made second officer mean-
time josh williams one of the able seamen foments discontent among the crew and one night
captain blake and manners are seized bound and placed in captivity while williams in-
forms ned wilson that the price of the safety of the women and children among the
passengers is his promise to faithfully navigate the ship to the best of his ability for the muti-
neers

    williams proposes to put the passengers ashore on one island and the two ships officers on
another but several clays elapse before land that seems suitable is sighted finally one about
six miles long is selected and the passengers are sent off in two boats at the last moment sibyl
stanley is detained from accompanying her friends williams arguing that she must be held to
insure neds trustworthiness captain blake and manners are landed on another island and
soon afterwards the flying cloud is put in at a third one having a safe harbor between tall cliffs
screening her from all observation ned while off on an exploring trip with sibyl finds a cave
containing thousands of dollars worth of gold a discovery which they determine to keep from
the knowledge of the mutineers meantime after mr grant has chanced upon the wreck of a
vessel the mermaid the party on refuge island build a raft on which to transport the wreck
piecemeal to the shore to be utilized in various ways on one of these journeys they fall in
with a canoe containing captain blake and rob manners and there is great rejoicing over the
reunion captain blake warns them that there are savages in the neighborhood and they pro-
ceed to build a house or fort out of a quarry they are fortunate enough to find on the island
they plan also to build a cutter in which to escape and after the laying of the keel captain
blake goes fishing on the raft he falls asleep and when he wakes discovers the sails of a large
ship gliding across the face of the moon just sinking to the horizon in a wild state of excite-
ment he hoists sail starts in pursuit and is overtaken by a frightful storm just as those on the
ship are about to take him on board

chapter xxvii-the sundered refugees

g very moment captain blake expects to hear above the noise of the
pouring rain the roar of the tornado that he knows must soon burst
upon him in spite of his desperate peril he calmly sets to work at once to
take what precautions he can against the t-mpests shock with all the cool-
ness and skill of a finished seaman he lowers the sail on deck and proceeds to
secure it as well as he can for he knows only too well what the next act in
the drama will be he knows too that those cm board the brig-invisible
now-are as well versed as himself and are at this moment far too busily en-

the mutiny on the flying cloud

gaged in preparing for the stroke of the hurricane to have a thought to spare
for him

   now the rain stops as suddenly as it began and an awful silence ensues
scarcely broken even by the lap of the water alongside for the terrific down-
pour has completely beaten down the swell aud save for an occasional gentle
heave the raft lies motionless

   now stand by  summon all your nerve and all your courage to your
aid skipper for you never stood half so sorely in need of them as you do
now

   listen what is that low murmur in the air which so rapidly
increases in volume until it becomes a deep hoarse bellowing roar

   the sound is broad on your starboard beam skipper  aft to your steer-
ing oar for your life man  sweep her head round quick in readiness to run
before it  that is well round with her again  another stroke

   now stand by  here it comes  seize that ropes end and hold on for your
life 

   a long line of milk white foam appears upon the horizon spreading and
advancing with awful rapidity  the roar swells in volume until it becomes
absolutely deafening  the air grows thick with vapor  a sudden whirl of
wind rushes past lashing the skippers face with rain drops as it goes-rain
drops no  they are salt salt as the brine alongside-and then with a wild
burst of hideous sound and a shock as though the raft had collided with
something solid the hurricane strikes her

   the white water surges up over her stern and the captain is hurled
forward face downward and half stunned upon her already submerged
deck

   the occupants of the fort retired to rest that night as usual soon
after sunset and thoroughly wearied out with the days labor soon sank to
sleep

   nobody felt in the least degree anxious about the skipper because when
grant and henderson took a last look at the weather before turning in there
was nothing particularly alarming in its aspect they agreed that there was
going to be a change and that it would probably occur before morning but
blake they considered was not the man to be caught napping moreover he
had already been absent long enough to make his return possible at any mo-
ment  so with this opinion expressed and understood all hands sou ht their
bunks with perfectly easy minds

   manners and nicholls were the first to awake which they did simulta-
neously when the hurricane burst over the island their sleeping room hap-
pening to be on the weather side of the fort or that upon which the gale
beat with the greatest fury and they were therefore naturally the first to be
disturbed by the uproar of the storm

   whew whistled manners as he settled himself more comfortably
in his cosy bunk  its blowing heavily  im glad i have no watch to keep
tonight listen to that   as the wind went howling aud careering past the
house causing it to tremble to its foundations  if its like that down here
in this sheltered valley what must it be outside in the open sea 

     
the mutiny on the flying cloud



    bad enough mr manners you may depend on it answered nicholls
who occupying the adjoining bunk had overheard this muttered soliloquy
 bad enough  this is the worse storm weve had since weve been on the
island why-listen to that now  and did ye feel the house shake sir 
why it must be blowing a regular tornado-or typhoon as they calls em in
these latitudes the skipper sleeps pretty sound through it dont he sir 
 he does indeed replied manners  and then a sudden recollection of
the fishing expedition coming upon him he added  i suppose he is asleep-
i suppose he is in his berth did you hear him come in  

     not i sir was the answer  i dozed off to sleep almost before i had
time to make myself comfortable and i never woke until a minute or two
since when the roar of the gale disturbed me

    are you awake captain blake  demanded manners sharply

   no answer and both men listen as well as they can through the awful
roar and shriek of the gale hoping to hear the measured breathing of the
sleeper but no such sound is heard  and after listening breathlessly for a
few seconds manners bounds out of his berth and fumbling about for the
matches finds them at last and strikes a light the skippers berth is empty
and undisturbed  it has evidently not been slept on that night

   manners and nicholls-the latter having also turned out-looked blankly
at the bunk and then at each other the same dreadful suspicion dawning upon
them both at the same instant

   good heavens gasped manners it cannot be that-and yet it
looks like it-is it possible tom that the skipper has not returned-that he
is at sea on the raft in this awful gale  

   im blest if it dont look uncommon like it sir is nicholls reply
uttered in a tone of desperate conviction  tell ye what tis sir he con-
tinued as he hastily proceeded to don a garment or two slipping his bare
feet into his shoes as he does so im off down to the creek to see if the
punt is there if she aint you may depend on it shes ridin at the rafts
moorins-if she aint swamped-and that the rafts at sea with the poor
skipper aboard of her the lord have mercy on him if it is so thats all i
says  

     stop a minute  i will go with you says manners also hastily dress-
ing   but before we go we had perhaps better inquire of mr grant or the
doctor whether they know anything about him  they are certain to be
awake  

   a minute later the two men are groping their way along the wall of the
courtyard toward grants room in which they can perceive a light man-
ners knocks and instantly receives the response 

    yes who is there  

     manners and nicholls sir do you know anything about the captain
mr grant  he is not with us and his bunk has not been slept in tonight
stay where you are-i will be out in a moment is the reply and
almost in the short space of time named grant emerges

    now then he demands somewhat sternly  what is it you say about
the captain  surely i cannot have heard you right


the mutiny on the flying cloud

    indeed i am afraid sir you did answered manners by this time in a
state of deep distress as the conviction forces itself upon him that the skipper
really is missing  i said sir that the captain is not with us and that his
bunk has not been slept in tonight  

    then god help him for i fear he is beyond all human aid   ejaculated
the engineer hoarsely  have you been down to the creek yet  he con-
tinued

   no sir says manners we were about to go down there but i
thought it best to speak to you first

    quite right assents grant   i will go with you

   the engineer reenters his room hastily explains the situation to mrs
grant and then returning leads the way up the staircase to the roof  that
it will be remembered being the only mode of exit from the building

   it is not until the three reach this comparatively exposed situation that
they at all realize the strength of the gale  but once there though the
building is surrounded on all sides by the high ground of the ravine through
which the river flows the tempest seizes upon them and beats and buffets
them and dashes them hither and thither with such irresistible power and
fury that they are in absolute peril of their lives while the remain there
and to avoid being actually hurled off into space they are constrained to go
down upon their hands and knees

   to add to their difficulties the darkness is so intense that they can see
absolutely nothing  they have to grope their way like blind men relying
solely upon their remembrance of localities for guidance and search as
they will they cannot find the exterior ladder by which to descend to the
ground outside it has doubtless been blown away

   this misfortune however is soon remedied by the substitution of a rope
from the store room for the missing ladder and with its assistance the three
men quickly reach the ground

   arrived there they find that their difficulties have only just begun for
they are no sooner clear of the house than what with the profound darkness
and the awful buffeting of the wind they soon get confused and lose their
way

   at length however after more than an hours aimless -wandering they
find themselves at the shipyard which is in quite another direction and once
there they are enabled by keeping close along the waters edge to reach the
creek

   as each had by this time expected the punt is not there  and now any
lingering hopes as to the skippers safety which either of them may have
cherished disappears and in his own mind each mutely gives the poor fellow
up as lost

   the punt being missing there is no means of crossing to the mainland
for the stream swollen by the recent rain is rushing past at a speed swift
enough to sweep away the strongest swimmer that ever breasted wave to
say nothing of the fact that the gale-which is opposed to the current-has
churned and lashed the waters into a sheet of blinding foam

   they can do nothing therefore except make an ineffectual effort to light
the mutiny on the flying cloud	

a fire in the liope that its blaze reflected in the sky may serve as a beacon
to their unfortunate friend in the improbable event of his still being alive and
within sight of the island  but this attempt also is frustrated by the wind
which not only renders it impossible for them to kindle a flame but also
sweeps away all their materials as fast as they are gathered

   there is nothing left for them then but to wend their way back home-
ward as best they can and await the dawn of day

chapter xxviii-the search for the captain

   the dawn that morning was long in coming and when at length the gray
murky light slowly forced its way through the overhanging canopy of rent
and tattered cloud which obscured the heavens wreck and destruction every-
where became visible grant island it is true had escaped almost unscathed
doubtless owing to its sheltered situation  but on the main island thousands
of trees were lying prostrate many of them uprooted and the rest snapped
off close to the ground

   as soon as it was light enough to see anything grant with henderson
this time as a companion once more made his way down to the creek but
there was nothing to be seen from there even the buoy attached to the rafts
mooriugs was invisible  but just where it ought to be there was a strong ripple
on the roughened surface of the water which seemed to suggest that the buoy
and possibly the swamped punt as well still remained there dragged under
water by the strength of the current

   it continued to blow very heavily-though not with the same awfully de-
structive violence which marked the first burst of the hurricane-all that day
and part of the ensuing night when the gale broke and by sunrise the wind
had dropped to a strong breeze then once more did the four men set out
from the fort in the almost hopeless effort to obtain some clue to the fate of
poor captain blake

   descending the outer ladder-which had been discovered on the previous
day at some distance from the fort-the search party first made for the creek
from the shore of which-the stream having by this time subsided and its
current sunk to its normal speed-they descried not only the buoy marking
the moorings of the raft but also as they had quite expected the swamped
punt hanging to it

   the latter was promptly secured manners swimming out to it with the
end of a line from the shore by means of which the craft was drawn in and
grounded upon the beach and bailed out

   the oars having been washed out of her and swept away the next thing
to be done was to work up a new pair-a task which was soon accomplished
since they now had an abundance of suitable material close at hand in the
shipyard

   this done the searchers made their way down stream and crossed to the
main island there separating into two parties one of which was to skirt the
shore to the northward and westward while the other was to proceed
in the opposite direction until the two parties reunited their object


the mutiny on the flying cloud

being not so much to look out seaward-for they knew that if the raft
had missed the island it would by that time be far enough away-but
rather to examine the shore for any sign of wreckage or the poor skippers
dead body

   henderson and nicholls constituted one party while grant and manners
formed the other they had not only a long but also a most toilsome journey
before them the difficulty arising chiefly from the nature of the ground they
had to traverse and it occupied them until well on in the afternoon of the
following day both parties camping in the woods for one night-and finding
it anything but a pleasant experience neither party found anything to
throw the least light upon the fate either of the raft or of the unfortunate
man who had gone to sea in her and when at length they met they had at
least the negative satisfaction of being able to say that after a thorough
search of the entire seaboard of the island they had discovered no actual proof
that the captain had lost his life

   very fortunately for them no damage had been done either to the mill or
in the shipyard  there was therefore no time lost in making good deficiencies
of that kind and they were consequently enabled to resume and carry on
their shipwrights work forthwith

    not until a full fortnight after the gale did they finally give up the skipper
as lost young manners being despatched every morning to the top of the
mountain with instructions to remain there all day and maintain a constant
lookout the party still hoping against their better reason that after all the
raft might have held together and that blake might in such a case strive to
regain the island but at the expiration of that time they felt that it was use-
less to hope further and the watching was discontinued

    dr henderson was the hero of the next adventure which befell the party 
and a pretty state of consternation he managed to throw everybody into for
the time being his poor wife and little lucille especially

   it happened thus it had been the custom of the party ever since their
landing upon the island to observe sunday as a day of rest prayers being
read both morning and evening whilst the rest of the day was devoted to such
recreation as they thought might legitimately be indulged in

   manners and nicholls after the manner of seamen usually devoted a
great deal of time on this particular day to the patching up of their clothes 
whilst the two married men took their wives and the youngsters for tol-
erably long walks when the weather permitted when the weather was
unfavorable for these walks grant was in the habit of routing out some inter-
esting book from his large stock and reading from it aloud whilst henderson
who was an enthusiastic botanist and chemist in the privacy of a little labora-
tory he had managed to fit up prosecuted his researches into the nature of
the various plants and herbs he had collected in former rambles

   they were all thus engaged on the afternoon of a rainy sunday about a
month after the mysterious disappearance of poor captain blake when the
rest of the party was suddenly startled by a loud cry for help from hender-
son the call being instantly repeated twice or thrice in a much weaker tone
of voice
the mutiny on the flying cloud



   tossing aside his book and springing to his feet grant at once rushed off
to the laboratory with all the others close at his heels and there they dis-
covered the unfortunate doctor in a most extraordinary state of mind and
body and at the same time became conscious of a faint fragrant odor per-
vading the atmosphere of the room

   pale as death with all his limbs hanging limp as if paralyzed the poor
fellow was huddled up in a chair upon which he had evidently flung himself
when the seizure-or whatever it was-first came upon him his eyes wee
rolling wildly and his teeth chattered as though he were suffering from an
ague fit but it was evident that he still retained his reason for the moment
that he saw the little crowd pouring into the room he cried out in a weak but
piping voice 

   fly fly for your lives my dear fellow turning to grant drive
them out  throw them out if they will not go otherwise  and throw open
that window at once  this atmosphere is deadly 

   this statement had the desired effect  the room was cleared promptly
everybody beating a somewhat precipitate retreat but the engineer and mrs
henderson the latter refusing to be removed upon the double plea that it
was no more dangerous for her than for grant and that whether or no her
proper place was beside her husband

   as for grant he acted with his usual decision first dashing the window
wide open and next stooping to raise his friend and convey him into a pre-
sumably more healthy atmosphere  and if any additional motive beyond so-
licitude for the sufferer were needed to impel him to this step he had it in a
curious sickly feeling of lassitude and languor which he felt stealing over
himself he raised the doctor in his arms and notwithstanding the increas-
ing sensation of feebleness and numbness which oppressed him staggered
with his burden into the outer air of the courtyard closely followed of course
by mrs henderson

   the patient was then conveyed to his own room and laid on his bed he
could do nothing but shiver and moan and cower down among the coverings

   the little party were almost beside themselves with anxiety and terror
which feelings were increased when poor mrs henderson exhibited symptoms
of a similar character

   as for grant he was thoroughly alarmed  for not only did the feeling
of feebleness increase but he also found himself gradually becoming the
victim of a blind unreasoning terror for which the term  abject cowardice 
afforded but a very inadequate description fully alive however to the
possibly critical state of affairs he battled desperately against the influences
at work upon him and with infinite patience at length succeeded in extort-
ing from henderson a few suggestions toward the adoption of remedial
measures which he put in force for the benefit of the doctor next for mrs
henderson-who had also succumbed to a similar though a much milder
attack-and lastly for himself

   nothing that was done however appeared to be of the slightest service
the symptoms continuing with unmitigated severity for fully eight hours
after which they gradually subsided grant was quite himself again by noon


the mutiny on the flying cloud

next jay  mrs henderson recovered a few hours later  but as for the doctor
it was fully a week before he entirely shook off the effects of the attack

   in less than twenty four hours from his first seizure he had sufficiently
recovered to give an explanation of the singular affair to the following effect
he had it would seem been investigating the nature of a hitherto unknown
plant growing in considerable abundance upon the island and had found it
to possess several very remarkable qualities some at least of which he be-
lieved might be rendered of the utmost value in medical practice anxious
to make his researches thoroughly exhaustive he had upon the day of the
catastrophe been distilling the essence of the plant  and his task completed
he was in the act of bottling the extract for future examination when its
peculiarly pleasing fragrance caused him to take several deep inhalations
from the flask

   he had hardly done so when he felt his strength rapidly leaving him and
he had only time to deposit the phial open upon his table and stagger to a chair
when something very like a fit of paralysis seized him he at once cried out
for help  but by the time that his cries had evoked a response his nerves had
begun to give way and in a very few minutes he was enduring such an
agony as words utterly failed him to describe

   his first act when he was sufficiently recovered to move about once more
was to secure the phial containing the liquid which had done all the mis-
chief and-wtith nicholls to manage the punt-go right out to sea where
hastily uncorking the bottle he flung it as far from him to leeward as pos-
sible at the same moment ordering his companion to give way for home again
with all speed

   this was done whilst the terror of his attack was still upon him  but it
was not in the nature of a man of hendersons training to give way for long
to so irrational a fear as that which prompted this action and in less than a
month afterward he had with the adoption of all proper precautions secured
another and far more liberal supply of the singular essence with a view to
future experiments and analysis

chapter xxix-the malays

   meanwhile the work at the shipyard was pushed forward with all pos-
sible energy and to such good purpose that in an incredibly short time all
things considered the timbers for the new boat were raised into position and
secured the planking carried up to the gunwale the deck laid and calked the
joiners work advanced and the spars put in hand

   everybody was in the highest possible spirits for they saw the end of
their labors rapidly approaching they were moreover not only pleased but
absolutely proud of their work for though of course only amateurs they
had wrought so carefully and conscientiously that everything was finished off
not only as strongly but also as neatly as if they had every one served an
apprenticeship to the handicraft

   then the little vessel herself was a perfect beauty graceful in shape
notwithstanding her extreme breadth of beam powerful yet buoyant and
the mutiny on the flying cloud



with lines so cunningly molded that while it would doubtless require a good
strong breeze to show her off to the utmost advantage nicholls and manners
-who might both be expected to know a good hull when they saw it-con-
fidently predicted that she would prove very nimble even in light airs

   and so confident were they of her sea going powers that they averred
again and again they would not be afraid to face in her even such a hurri-
cane as that which had robbed them of poor captain blake  indeed they
even went the length of volunteering to take her half around the world to
new york after she should have accomplished the primary mission of her
existence in conveying the party to a civilized port

   matters were in this satisfactory state the work having reached such a
stage of advancement that the rigging of the petrel-as they had decided to
name the little cutter-had already been begun and some talk was being in-
dulged in of hopes that the launch might be accomplished within the
following week when on a bright sunday afternoon grant started for
the main island taking the two children with him the object of the little
party being to gather a few of the strangely shaped and exceedingly beautiful
shells to be found on the sea beach as mementoes of their long sojourn on
refuge island

   the ladies preferred to remain at home deciding that the day was far
too hot for walking exercise  and the doctor remained with them for com-
pany

   it was getting on toward sunset-indeed the sun had already disap-
peared behind the high ground to the westward of the fort-and the doctor
with his two fair companions had ascended to the flat rampart-like roof of the
building to enjoy the cool refreshing breeze and watch for the return of the
shell gatherers when the sound of a musket shot quickly followed by some
five or six others broke upon the air with startling effect and immediately
afterwards the head of a lofty triangular sail glided into view from behind
some tall bushes which had hitherto concealed its approach

   that a strange craft of some sort was in the river was the first idea which
presented itself to hendersons mind that grant-who was unarmed-and
the children were but too probably at that moment crossing from the main
and consequently in full view from the deck of the strange craft was the
next and that the firing must necessarily have proceeded from the unlooked
for visitor and be an indication of hostility possibly directed against grant
and the youngsters was the third-the three ideas following each other with
the rapidity of a lightning flash

   to these succeeded a fourth-the malays 

   so long a time had elapsed since poor blake had arrived with his alarming
intelligence respecting the propinquity of these rascals and his disquieting
suggestions as to a possible visit from them that though his anxious watch
had been for some time maintained the uninterrupted absence of any alarm-
ing indications had at length resulted in so complete a relaxation of vigilance
that even the very existence of these pests of the eastern seas had been
forgotten

   what if the wretches were upon them now  it seemed only too probable


the mutiny on the flying cloud

   as these thoughts darted through hendersons brain and with them the
frightful suggestion that those three-the unarmed man and the two helpless
children one of them his-might at that moment be beset by a cruel and
bloodthirsty foe a cold shudder went through his frame and hurriedly
speaking to his companions a few words which he intended should be reassur-
ing but which his manner rendered quite the reverse he dashed down the
inner stairway to the courtyard and seizing grants repeating rifle which he
knew to be loaded and directing manners and nicholls-who had rushed out
of their room at the sound of the firing-to arm themselves and follow him
he rushed up to the roof again descending to the ground by the outer
ladder he hurried in the direction of the creek

   he had not advanced in this direction much beyond a hundred yards
along the pathway through the brush when a childs screams-little
lucilles-smote upon his distracted ear and darting forward in a very
frenzy of apprehension as he sprang round a bend in the path the poor
child her head uncovered and her long fair hair streaming behind her her
sweet eyes wild with terror and her little hands outstretched rushed up to
him and with an inarticulate cry of joy sank exhausted and almost lifeless at
his feet

   behind her not a dozen yards distant followed a fierce looking malay his
parted lips revealing the white teeth clenched in the eagerness of pursuit his
cruel black eyes gleaming with the ferocious joy of anticipated success and
with a murderous looking creese with a long blade uplifted in readiness to
strike the moment he should have brought the poor innocent little victim
within reach of his lean muscular arm

   to spring over the prostrate form of his darling child thus placing
himself between her and her pursuer while he raised his rifle to his
shoulder was an act of such lightning-like rapidity with henderson that he
and his foe were almost within striking distance before he could check his
career

   the next instant the crack of his rifle rang out sharp and clear and the
malay with a convulsive bound crashed face downward at his feet

   breathless with excitement and the exertion of his short run his teeth
clenched and the fierce eagerness for battle suddenly awakened to full activ-
ity within him the doctor stood waiting impatiently for the next foe to pre-
sent himself

chapter xxx-lucilles story

   dr henderson stood breathless with excitement and suspense for some
minutes after his victory over the first malay momentarily expecting fresh
foes to appear

   but none came  only manners and nicholls now appeared upon the scene
with their rifles in their hands and eager questions in their ees and on their
lips for an explanation of the sudden and tragic turn of affairs

   to them in a few terse words henderson stated what had already taken
place adding an expression of his apprehension that grant and little percy
the mutiny on the flying cloud



had fallen into the hands of the enemy and finally directing the two men to
advance with caution as far as possible with the view of ascertaining the
whereabouts of the missing ones and of affording them help if help were in-
deed still possible and when they had done all that they could to the best of
their judgment to return to the fort with intelligence

    haying thus dismissed his companions the doctor tenderly raised the now
insensible lucille in his arms and pressing her to his breast wtith a sob of
inarticulate gratitude for her preservation he wended his way back to the
fort with a heavy grief stricken heart wondering meanwhile how he could
best meet the anxious inquiries which he knew would be made by poor mrs
grant

   as he approached the fort he saw the two ladies watching for him  and
anxious not to unduly alarm them he cried out-referring to lucille-as
soon as he had approached within shouting distance 

    it is all right  she is not hurt only frightened a little get her bed
ready

   upon hearing this mrs grant supposing that her husband and percy
were following at their leisure hurried away to prepare lucilles bed for her
leaving mrs henderson to receive her child

   this afforded the doctor an opportunity which to speak the truth was
most welcome to him he knew from experience the consummate tact which
women are wont to exercise in the breaking of bad news and he resolved
forthwith to delegate to his wife the task to which he had been looking for-
ward with so much mental perturbation

    so as soon as he reached his wifes side he said hastily 

    look here rose dear you need not be alarmed with the exception of
being frightened very nearlj out of her wits poor child there is nothing
wrong with lucille  she has swooned with terror but i can soon put her all
right again the malays however have landed on the island and i am
dreadfully afraid they have got grant and poor little percy but we can know
nothing for certain until the return of manners and nicholls who have gone
forward to reconnoiter poor mrs grant is certain to inquire presently for
her husband and child so i want you to go to her now break to her as
gently as possible what i have just told you laying stress at the same time
upon the fact that we know nothing certainly as yet and that matters may
turn out much better than we apprehend see  there she is now go to her
and be as gentle as ou can

   full of sympathy mrs henderson at this hurried away upon her painful
errand  whilst her husband as soon as the coast was clear made his way
down to his own room with the unconscious lucille

   arrived there he laid the child upon her bed and then opened the com-
pact medicine chest which on leaving new york he had happily taken the
precaution of adding to his personal outfit and this done he forthwith set
about the task of restoration

   the task proved more difficult and of longer duration than he had
anticipated  and before success rewarded his efforts his wife rejoined him in
tears


the mutiny on the flying cloud

    well he said nervously and without desisting a moment from his
occupation  how have you managed 

    gh duncan   sobbed mrs henderson  it was dreadful  poor dear
ida is quite prostrated with grief and terror though she did and is still doing
her best to bear up under the awful agony of suspense fancy both
husband and child-oh it is horrible  can nothing be done to save
them 

    nothing just now i fear was the gloomy response  you see there
are but three fighting men of us now and we do not know how many of the
enemj there are it is quite useless to attempt the devising of plans until
the other two return with intelligence  then indeed we will see what can
be done and it shall go hard but we will rescue them somehow where
did you leave mrs grant

     in her own room on her knees praying for her lost ones  it is all she
can do poor soul ah  the dear child is reviving at last is she not 

    yes yes answered henderson hurriedly  now reach me that glass
of medicine from the table thanks here lucille my dear drink this
little one it will do you good

   a faint tinge of returning color at length appeared in the childs pale
cheeks and lips this had been succeeded by a fluttering sigh or two and
then her eyes had opened suddenly with a look of terror which had given
place to one of joy and relief as she recognized her father and mother bend-
ing over her upon this henderson had gently raised her and promptly ad-
ministered the draft which he had prepared

   presently the little creature spoke oh mamma she exclaimed
looking somewhat wildly about her is it morning  is it time to get up  i

have had such a dreadful dream- 

   there  never mind your dream  forget all about it and try to go to
sleep again said mrs henderson soothingly  it is not quite time to get
up yet

    yes  go to sleep again like a good girl agreed henderson   but you
can tell us your dream first dear if you very much wish to do so you for-
get he added in an undertone to his wife   she may be able to throw a
good deal of light upon the state of affairs and afford us information of the
last importance what was your dream darling

    oh began the child  i dreamt that we-mr grant and percy and i
you know-had been to the beach gathering shells and as we were coming
back in the boat a great ship suddenly came round the corner full of ugly
wicked men  and they fired guns at us and one of them hit mr grant for
i saw the blood running down his face they came after us in a boat and
were quite near us when wte reached the creek and then mr grant told
percy and me to run home as fast as ever wte could  and he took one of the
boats oars and got out and stood on the beach and looked as if he was going
to fight the men so percy took my hand and we ran-oh ever so fast and
i looked around and saw mr grant fighting all the men with the oar and
then we turned a corner and i felt tired and wanted to stop but percy
wouldnt let me and we kept on running and i began to cry and just as
the mutiny on the flying cloud



i wanted to stop again we heard somebody running after us and i thought
it was mr grant but it wasnt it was one of the ugly men out of the ship
and he had a long knife in his hand so we ran faster and then percy fell
down but i ran on and the ugly man caught percy and-oh mamma 
here the poor little creatures eyes filled with tears and the frightened look
returned to them  was it a dream or did it really happen 

    it really happened dear answered henderson who made it a point of
never deceiving his child about anything it really happened but never
mind you are with us now you know and quite safe so lie down and try to
go to sleep and do not trouble about percy we will have him and his papa
both safe back with us tomorrow morning please god  what a horrible
experience for the poor child-and what dreadful news about those two 
he murmured to his wife as lucille sank back and closed her eyes again
under the influence of the soothing draft he had administered fancy
that poor little fellow percy in the hands of those fiends hark  is not that
manners voice hailing outside  stay here with lucille and hold her hand 
it will soothe her and i will go and lower the ladder

   with that henderson hurried away

chapter xxxi-an anxious night

   arrived at the head of the staircase henderson approached the parapet
and leaning over peered down into the gathering darkness

    is that you manners he asked seeing a couple of figures standing
close underneath him

    ay ay sir  here we are answered manners for himself and his com-
panion  will you kindly lower the ladder please doctor

   the ladder was lowered and in another moment nicholls made his appear-
ance above the parapet closely followed by manners who immediately hauled
up the ladder after him

   well questioned henderson impatiently seeing that neither of the
men evinced a disposition to speak   well what is the news

   the worst sir the very worst answered manners with unusual
emotion theyve got both mr grant and little percy  and would you
believe it sir the fiends have actuallj been ill treating the poor little fel-
low just for the sake seemingly of tormenting his father

   henderson groaned aloud in his bitterness of spirit on hearing this

   its awful isnt it sir continued manners grinding his teeth with
rage  nus here wanted to open fire upon them there and then and
board in the moke-dash in among them in the midst of the confusion sir
and see if we couldnt cut the two of them adrift and bring them off with us
theres nothing would have suited me better for it made fairly mad to see the
brutes strike that poor little innocent child and he and his father lashed to a
couple of trees  but it wouldnt do-it wouldnt do sir  there were too many
of them for us i counted twenty seven of them all told after the second
party had come ashore from the proa we couldnt have done any good
and beside there were you and the ladies to be thought of so after we


the mutiny on the flying cloud

bad watched them for some time i thought our best plan would be to come
back here and consult with you especially as they seemed to be getting ready
to beat up our quarters but were determined nicholls and i to have a
slap at them some time tonight in some shape or form and the only question
is how is it best to be done  

   henderson stretched out a hand to each of them which was cordially
grasped as he said huskily

   thank you thank you my stanch and trusty friends both we will
have a slap at them as you say but we must do nothing hastily or without
careful consideration-the issues involved are too many the stake too great
for us to risk anything by over rashness let us each think the matter over
carefully and meanwhile as we shall need all our strength you nicholls
go down and bring us up something to eat and drink as this may be our only
chance to snatch a morsel of refreshment and whilst he is doing that
perhaps you manners will kindly go down and bring up all the arms and
ammunition you can find so that if the malays come this way we may be
prepared to give them a warm reception i will keep watch here

   in another minute henderson was alone on the parapet with the
violet star studded sky above him and  every hand the black outline of
the high land and the dense growth of trees and bush which hemmed in the
fort

   not a sound met his ear save the continuous chirr of the myriads of
insects with which the island abounded the distant wash and gurgle of
the river aud the mournful sighing of the night breeze through the
foliage

   the whereabouts of the malay camp was faintly indicated by an occa-
sional gleam of ruddy light flashing upon the branches and leaves of a lofty
tree in the direction of the creek  and most gratifying sight of all away to
the eastward the sky was brightening into silvery radiance showing that the
full moon would shortly send her friendly light upon the scete

   the two men soon returned from below in the performance of their sev-
eral tasks manners having had the forethought to load the firearms by the
light of a lantern whilst still in the armory

   a few minutes later the moon rose slowly into view from above the low
lying land beyond the malay encampment flooding the whole scene with
soft subdued light  and manners then went from loophole to loophole look-
ing for signs of the enemy but without detecting any indication of their
presence

   though none of them had the slightest appetite for food three men
now proceeded to force a little refreshment down their throats knowing full
well that ere long they would have need of all their strength  and whilst
they ate the conversation naturally turned upon the two hapless prisoners
and the best means for effecting their rescue

   henderson indeed had been able to think of little else since the moment
when his child had recovered sufficiently to relate her horrible experience 
and whilst turning the matter over in his mind a hopeful thought had sug-
gested itself
the mutiny on the flying cloud



   what he asked himself could have been the motive of the malays in
making prisoners of those two was it not likely that their object was
plunder and the extortion of a ransom  and if so he was resolved that
anything in reason which might be demanded-anything in short which
should leave the party with the means of defending themselves and providing
for their ultimate safety-should be granted let the wretches but be per-
suaded to give up their prisoners unharmed and to leave the island and he
would not haggle about the price to be paid

   the trio were anxiously discussing together this hopeful view of the mat-
ter when watchful manners who had stationed himself at the loophole for the
purpose of maintaining a ceaseless lookout suddenly raised his hand waru-
ingly and then pointed iu the direction of the pathway leading to the creek

   springing to their feet his companions at once stationed themselves in
positions which gave them a view of the spot indicated and looking intently
they presently detected in the deepest shadow of the bush two or three other
shadows which they speedily identified as human fignres the more readity
from the fact that a stray moonbeam occasionally fell upon and glinted from
their naked weapons

   the two or three were quickly joined by others who emerged silently
from the pathway through the bush until the watchers were able to count a
dozen in all

    now sir what do you say shall we open fire upon them you and i
with mr grants repeaters and nicholls with his rifle  we could bowl
over at least half of them before they could get away whispered manners

    no  not for the world was the answer  let us watch them and
see if we can get an inkling of what their intentions may be they at least
cannot get at us here and any precipitate action  our part may only make
matters worse for poor grant our policy is to keep them in the dark as long
as possible as to the number of their opponents  

   the malays having gained-unperceived they doubtless hoped-the cover
afforded by the deep shadow of a dense clump of bush some two hundred
yards distant from the fort were now clustered closely together therein ap-
parently engaged upon a close inspection of the curious building before them
and probably comparing notes thereon

   they evidently seemed quite unable to arrive at any satisfactory conclu-
sion with respect to it  and the fact that everything was perfectly dark
silent and motionless about the fort-all the shutters in the exterior walls
having been carefully closed-seemed to have excited misgiving rather than
confidence in their breasts for a figure would now and then detach itself from
the rest and  hands and knees advance cautiously a little way through
the long grass into the open as though to gain a nearer view of the building
and then somewhat precipitately retire again as though the courage of the
adventurer were not equal to the task which he had undertaken

   at length these tactics ceased and the party seeming to have finally
made up their minds to be at least doing something began still clinging te-
naciously to the deepest shadow to move quietly along in a direction which
would eventually lead to their discovery of the shipyard


the mutiny on the flying cloud

    that will do whispered henderson to his companions as soon as he
observed this  they must not be allowed to reach the shipyard or they
will doubtless set fire to the cutter and everything else there now you see
that broad strip of moonlit sward over there which they are approaching
the first man who attempts to cross i will fire at you manners taking the
second i the third and so on you and i firing alternately so that we may
take the better aim and nicholls reserving his fire in case of a rush should
such take place we must all fire as rapidly as possible with the object of
checking it but remember this both of you we must each make absolutely
certain of his man before pulling trigger not a single bullet must be
wasted because in this case it will give an immense advantage if we can im-
press the enemy with a conviction of the deadly character of our fire now
make ready and recollect i fire first

   as the doctor spoke he carefully leveled his repeating rifle through a loop-
hole and brought the sights in line with the trunk of a young sapling which
stood full in the moonlight and in front of which the stealthily advancing
figures would have to pass

   his heart throbbed so loudly that he could hear its pulsations-one twto
three four the first figure is on the verge of the moonlight he pauses a
moment looks anxiously at the fort and then starts at a run to cross to the
next patch of friendly shadow

   poor wretch  he little knows how true an eye is watching behind the
sights of a rifle waiting for him to come in line with the sapling

   another stride will bring him in line with it-crack a flash of fire a
little puff of smoke and he flings up his arms as he falls heavily forward
into the grass

   a second figure has already emerged into the bright moonlight following
the first it pauses at the flash and the report as if about to turn back

   too late  a second flash and a second report and he too falls forward
on his face

   a third now springs out of the shadow and stoops forward as if to drag
the fallen man back into shelter  but before he can reach him he too falls
before hendersons deadly rifle

   that stops the advance effectually the remaining figures huddling close
together where they stand a most fatal mode of grouping themselves this
for the doctor whose blood is now fully up gives the word to fire into them
as they stand and instantly out flashes the fire of three rifles from as many
loopholes followed by such a commotion over there among the shadows as
seems to indicate that the fire has not been in vain

   two more shots one each from henderson and manners complete the
enemys discomfiture and a hasty retreat is commenced

    follow them up now  fire away  exclaims henderson eagerly   but
take careful aim now is our opportunity to teach them a wholesome
lesson 

   and follow them up they did with such deadly persistency that four only
out of the twelve succeeded in making good their retreat and regaining the
path leading to the cove
the mutiny on the flying cloud



   splendid exclaimed the doctor with pardonable exultation as he
hastened with a parting shot the disappearance of the last figure   we shall
neither see nor hear anything more of those fellows tonight and now let us
once more see if we cannot hit upon some cheme for the deliverance of those
two our valued friend grant and his little son	

chapter xxxii-a terrible dilemma

   dr henderson was mistaken in supposing that he had seen the last of
the malays for that night for about two hours later whilst the three refugees
were still anxiously discussing the one question which above all others
absorbed their thoughts aud were seemingly just as far as ever from any prac-
ticable solution of it a gleam of ruddy light suddenly appeared in the path-
way leading from the creek and a minute later two malays stepped boldly
into the open one of them holding aloft a lighted torch in one hand and a
palm branch in the other whilst the second man displayed what looked like a
sheet of paper

      a flag of truce    exclaimed henderson as he critically examined the
two men through the loophole   let them approach  we will hear what
they have to say-that is if they can make themselves intelligible

   the malays advanced boldly enough across the open toward the fort evi-
dently quite satisfied that the palm branch afforded them full and absolute
protection and at length came to a halt beneath the walls

    well what do you want   demanded the doctor of them in english as
he leaned over the parapet

   the one who bore the paper seemed quite to comprehend the purport of
the question for he said something unintelligible in reply made a motion of
writing upon the paper and then held it aloft toward henderson

    um  a letter muttered the doctor possibly from grant have
you any string either of you    turning to his companions

   nicholls happened to have a small ball of spun yarn in his pocket aud
this being produced was unwound and the end lowered down to the letter
bearer who gravely attached the letter or whatever it was to it made an
oriental obeisance and promptly retired followed by his companion

   now nicholls said henderson as he hauled up and secured the
document  you mount guard here keep a sharp lookout and give the
alarm the moment you note anything suspicious mr manners and i are
going below to see what news this letter contains  

   that the letter was not from grant was evident the moment it was
opened for it consisted of nothing more than a series of roughly but vigor-
ously executed drawings

    the first sketch or that which occupied the top of the sheet consisted of
a straight horizontal stroke with markings underneath it which were evidently
intended to represent waves  and on the center of the horizontal line stood a
semicircle with straight lines radiating from it with a bold single upright
stroke to the left of it

   though roughly executed there was no doubt this was intended to re-


the mutiny on the flying cloud

present either the rising or the setting sun probably the former the upright
stroke being perhaps intended to indicate the first sunrise or that of the next
morning  at all events so henderson interpreted it

   the second sketch rudely but unmistakably represented the fort with the
exception that in order to make his meaning perfectly clear the artist was
obliged to add a door out of this door several white men were walking

o y

with guns in their hands which the leading figures were either delivering
up or had already delivered up to a body of malays

   a second group of whites and malays was shown to the right of the
sketch the malays being represented as handing over to the unarmed whites
two prisoners with ropes round their necks and their hands tied behind them
one of the prisoners was an adult whilst the other was much smaller  and
there could be no doubt whatever that they were intended to indicate grant
and percy

   the third and last sketch was also a representation of the fort but iu this
case it was drawn without a door looking over the parapet were a number
of white men with guns in their hands which they were pointing at a party
of malays on the ground below who in turn were pointing guns at the
whites  while to the right of this picture was drawn another group a most
sinister one for it represented grant and percy bound to two trees and sur-
rounded by a pile of-presumable-branches to which other malays were in
the act of applying a blazing torch 

   henderson and manners studied this document most attentively for some
time and they at length agreed that only one meaning could possibly be in-
tended to be conveyed by it-namely that if the fort and all it contained in-
cluding weapons were surrendered by sunrise or sunset-but most probably
the former-next day grant and percy would be delivered up by their
captors  but if not then the fort would be attacked and the two captives
burnt alive 

    why this is horrible  exclaimed henderson as he finally folded up
the document and carefully placed it in his pocket   we cannot possibly
make the unconditional surrender which they demand it would simply be
placing the entire party grant and his child included at the mercy of a pack
of treacherous bloodthirsty scoundrels who would probably slaughter us all
in cold blood as soon as we had delivered up our weapons on the other
hand it is equally out of the question that we should abandon those two
poor souls to the frightful fate with which they are threatened what is to
be done manners  

    let us go up on the parapet and talk the matter over with nicholls sir
was the reply  he is a quiet inoffensive fellow but thoroughly to be de-
pended upon in a fight and he is pretty long headed too  perhaps he may be
able to help you out with a suggestion at all events sir you may depend
upon it that neither mr grant nor little percy-poor little chap -shall be
burnt alive or dead whilst i can strike a blow to prevent it

    come then said henderson  let us go and hear what nicholls has
to say upon the matter  

   but nicholls seemed completely to lose in horror the long headedness with
sleeps favorite

 

which manners had credited him as soon as he was made acquainted with
the terms of the singular document handed in by the malays and beyond the
utterance of several very hearty maledictions upon the heads of those scoun-
drels and the reiterated declaration that they should kill him before they
harmed a hair of the head of either of the prisoners he had nothing to say

   henderson was reduced to a condition of absolute despair

    leave me both of you he at length exclaimed in desperation-leave
me to watch and to think out this matter alone  lie down and rest if you can
for an hour or two husband your strength as much as possible for we shall
have need of it all before sunrise-he shuddered involuntarily as he uttered
the last word- and fear not i will call you in good time

   the two men turned and without a wrord retired below to their room
leaving the doctor to wrestle alone with the difficult question of what was his
actual duty in this terrible strait

   reader do not mistake this mans character no braver or more gallant
man-no nobler or stancher friend-ever lived than he had he been an un-
married man or had those two women and that helpless child his daughter
been in a place of safety he would have unhesitatingly accepted the hints
which manners and nicholls had so repeatedly thrown out and placing him-
self at their head would have marched with a light heart against the malays
and either have rescued the captives or have perished with them

   but the odds against him and his two companions were so great-a little
over seven to one even now after the losses already sustained by the enemy
-that he felt that he dared not indulge in any hope of success especially as
those odds would be so greatly increased by even one casualty on his side and
if failure ensued what would be the result to them all including the women
and the child st ill safe in the shelter of the fort  it would not bear thinking
about

    god help me  he cried in his despair  what shall i do

   the minutes dragged by while he sat there motionless on the roof with
his head bowed down and his face between his hands

   at last he sprang to his feet a look of determination had replaced the
helpless expression that his face had worn he had resolved upon a plan of
action it was a desperate one but he had decided to risk his life and the
lives of his friends in the attempt to carry it to success

the deed that cost john jeffreys months of misery-from pillar to post in quest of daily bread-
the remorseless fate that pursued a tarnished name

synopsis of chapters previously published

   while away at boarding school john jeffreys during a game of football accidentally in-
jures a boy so badly that his life is despaired of jeffreys thereupon runs away from bolsover
and returns to his guardian in york who turns him adrift after informing him that the money
left for him by his father has been lost through an unfortunate speculation jeffreys finally
finds a position as under teacher in galloway house a school for little boys conducted by mrs
trimble the boys take to him which arouses the ire of mrs trimbles son jonah who abstracts
from his pocket a letter speaking of young forrester the boy injured at school jeffreys is once
more cast on the cold charities of the world which throws him only one sop in the shape of julius
his guardians dog who has been abandoned when mr halgrove moves away leaving not a trace
behind jeffreys tramps his way to grangerham where he can find out but little about for-
rester and then seeking refuge for the night in a tumble down shed overhears a plot to abduct
percy rimbolt the fourteen year old son of a wealthy family in the neighborhood with the
assistance of the dog julius he frustrates this and restores percy to his home

   mr rimbolt takes a fancy to jeffreys and appoints him to the post of private librarian at a
salary of a hundred pounds a year he gets on famously with percy end is treated with
marked favor by raby atherton percys cousin but mrs rimbolt dislikes the newcomer and
neglects no opportunity to humiliate him during the holidays mrs scarfe and her son arrive
on a visit and in the young man jeffreys recognizes a schoolmate at bolsover one fully cogni-
zant of the forrester affair some time later after the household has moved to london scarfe
writes to mrs rimbolt telling in exaggerated fashion why jeffreys left bolsover mr rimbolt
who has been made acquainted with the whole history and elected to take jeffreys for what he
is and not for what he was is away and as mrs rimbolt requests the librarian to leave the
house within half an hour he has no qhoice but to obey once more adrift he wanders about
london and is soon on the verge of starvation one night he saves a man who has tried to
drown himself and who proves to be jonah trimble jeffreys cares for him as well as he can
and then coming back one day to their poor shelter finds jonah dead and a note from the
 angel  he has talked of as visiting him saying that he passed away peacefully and the writing
is that of raby atherton but jeffreys pride will not suffer him to reveal his whereabouts even
though he sees an advertisement of mr rimbolts asking for the information he does call on
a firm of attorneys through whom rabys father is seeking news of gerrard forrester and tells
all he knows but absolutely refuses to see their principal in his poor home at star alley he
makes himself of use to the other lodgers and on the death of a poor woman adopts her two
little boys shortly after this a fire breaks out in the neighborhood and jeffreys saves a bed
ridden inmate of the burning house and brings him to his own attic as the fellow slowly
opens his eyes his rescuer recognizes young forrester

chapter xli-at last

r aby had come home with a strange story from storr alley that after-
noon she was not much given to romance but to her there was some-
thing pathetic about this man john and his unceremonious adoption of
those orphan children she had not seen anything exactly like it and it
moved both her admiration and curiosity

 this story began in the october  issue of the argosy the seven back numbers will
be mailed to any address on receipt of  cents
living it down

i

   slie had heard much about john from the neighbors and all she had
heard had been of the right sort jonah had talked bitterly of him now and
then but before he died he had acknowledged that john had been his only
friend little annie had never mentioned him without a smile brightening
on her face  and even those who had complaints to pour out about everybody
all round could find nothing to say about him yet she seemed destined
never to see him

   little tim when she had entered the attic that morning and found the
two desolate babies in possession had replied in answer to her natural in-
quiry john ran away lies afraid of you he dont like ladies hes
coming back  she stayed and did what she could for the friendless orphans
and tried to brighten the room by a few feminine touches she half hoped
he might return before she had done but he did not and when she left the
baby was asleep on the bed and tim perched on his look out at the window
seat where jeffreys found them ten minutes later

    perhaps suggested her father to whom she narrated her adventures

  your shy friend has his reasons for keeping in the background he may be
an amiable criminal in hiding

    a criminal could not look after two stray babies like that said raby
well it is curious and interesting one touch of nature makes the
whole world kin you know so the unknown john whatever else he is is
a brother and deserves to be respected i hope his shyness however may
not take the very awkward turn which jeffreys has wilkins tells me he took
fright directly when even my name was introduced  and he wouldnt be sur-
prised if he disappears altogether now

    oh father  then we have really done more harm than good  
thats a cheerless way of putting it he has promised to call again
next week and if nothing occurs to terrify him meantime he may cdll do it
but wilkins says there seems no getting at him he will talk about for-
rester but when he comes to himself he shuts up like a snail into his shell
the next day at her usual time raby turned her steps to storr alley
groups of people stood about in the court and it was evident since she was
last there something unwonted had happened a firemans helmet at the
other end of the alley in the passage leading to drivers court told its own
tale  and if that was not enough the smell of fire and the bundles of rags
and broken furniture which blocked up the pathway were sufficient evidence

   the exiles from drivers stared hard at the young lady as she made her
way through the crowd  but the people of storr alley treated her as a friend
and she had no lack of information as to the calamity of the preceding night

    bless you   said the woman who lived in jeffreys tenement  it wtas
a proper flare up  three ouses burned out afore the ingins come  and then
they couldnt do nothink for the crowds  

    and was any one killed or hurt  asked raby

   killed  yes three or four they say but bless you i dont know
nothink of them drivers people dont you have nothink to do with em
missy they aint decent folk like us look at em  theres a nice mess
theyre makings our alley in  why cant they take their ooks somewheres


living it down

else we dont want em im sure yes and thered ave been one more
dead if it adnt been for our john to get him out moren any of them
would a done for us  tipsy brutes  thats what they is and they ought to
block up that there passage way the bord o works ought and let em keep
theirselves to theirselves  we dont want em im sure 

   when she paused for breath raby inquired 

    and did john save somebodys life  

    yus  a bloomin cripple as bad as the rest of em you can take your
davy if hed ad the chance  and theres john that bruised and urt its a
disgrace to see and im bein so good to them babies too and all that 
raby heard her out there was a lot more to tell then she said 

    well i dare say i shall see you again mrs brook ill call and see
some of my friends now

    you better give a look in at johns its my notion things is queer up
there

   raby paid several visits on her way up then with some trepidation
she knocked at the door of the garret

   there was no reply from within till she turned the handle and said

      may i come in  

   then a voice replied 

    yes if you like and she entered

   it was a strange scene which met her eyes as she did so

   a lad was stretched on the bed awake but motionless regarding with
some anxiety a baby who slumbered nestling close to his side on the floor
curled up with his face to the wall lay a man sleeping heavily  while tim
divided in his interest between the stranger on the bed and the visitor at the
door stood like a little watch dog suddenly put on his guard
 majr i come in said raby again timidly

   here she is cried tim running to her  johns asleep and he
pointing to the figure on the bed  cant run about

    correct timothy said the youth referred to  i cant--hullo  
this last exclamation was caused by his catching sight of raby at the
door he had expected a lodger  but what was this apparition 

    please come in said he bewildered   its a shocking room to ask you
into and-timothy introduce me to your friend

   raby smiled  and how the crippled lad thought it brightened the room 

    tim and i are friends said she lifting up the child to give him a kiss
 im afraid you are very badly hurt i heard of the fire as i came up

    no im all right  im never very active in fact i can only move my
hands and my head as timothy says i cant run im a cripple i shouldnt
be anything if it wasnt for jeff hullo jeff  wake up old man  

   raby started and turned pale as she raised her hand to prevent his wak-
ing the sleeper

    no please dont wake him  what did you say his name was 
jeffreys-john jeffreys-commonly called jeff he hauled me out of
the fire last night and guessed as little at the time wrho i was as i guessed
who he was i cant believe it yet its like a-
living it down



    you havent told me your name said raby faintly

    gerrard forrester at your service hullo i say are you ill hi jeff
wake up old man  youre wanted

   raby had only time to sink to a chair and draw tim to her when jeffreys
suddenly woke and rose to his feet

     what is it forrester old fellow anything wrong    said he springing
to the bedside

    i dont know whats the matter-look behind you

chapter xlii-forresters story

   why did she cry asked tim presently when she had gone i
know  because of that ugly man said he pointing to forrester

     excuse me young man i have the reputation of being good looking
that cannot have been the reason but jeff im all in a dream who is
she  and how comes she to know you and me  and as timothy perti-
nently remarks  whence these tears   tell us all about it before the baby
wakes  

   jeffreys told him the story was the history of his life since he had left
bolsover and it took long to tell for he passed over nothing

    poor old man said forrester when it was done  what a lot you have
been through   

    have i not deserved it that day at bolsover-

    oh for goodness sake dont go back to that you know it was an
accident and what was not an accident was the fault of my own folly that
night i awoke and saw you standing at the door i knew that you had already
suffered as much as i had

    that was the last time i saw you you forget i have still to hear what
happened to you afterwards

   its pretty easily told but i say jeff what did you say her name
was   

    raby atherton said jeffreys smiling this was about the twentieth
time the boy had broken in with some question about her  she is the
daughter of your guardian colonel atherton who was your fathers comrade
in afghanistan some day she will tell you the story of a battle out there
which will make you proud of being captain forresters son but i want to
hear about you

    just one minute then you knew she visited about here but she had

no idea you were here  

    no none

    why didnt you let her know 

    oh thats a long story too said jeffreys coloring

    and an interesting one also i guess said forrester  anything you
want to hear about-hang the baby hes awake 

   it was all up with story telling that day the baby took a lot of pacify-
ing and after him tim who had felt out of it all the morning turned crusty
on their hands
	living it down

   it was dark before peace reigned once more and then forrester told
his story

    i was taken home to grangerham you know my grandmother was
ill at the time and just starting south so i was left in charge of my old
nurse she was an awful brick to me was that old soul and i dont believe
i know et all she did and put up with for me

    the doctors at grangerham couldnt make anything of me one said
id be cutting about again in a few weeks and another said id be buried in
a few days its hard to decide when doctors disagree at that rate and old
mary gave it up and did what was the best thing-kept me quietly at home
of course we thought that my grandmother had written to my father but she
hadnt so he cant have heard for ages we heard of my grandmothers
death presently and then made the pleasant discovery that she had died in
debt and that the furniture of the house was hired that pulled mary and
me up short she had saved a little and i believe she spent every penny of
that to get me up to london to a hospital i didnt have a bad time of it
there for a month or two i was considered an interesting case and had all
sorts of distinguished fellows to come and look at me and i lived like a fight-
ing cock all the time i found as long as i lay flat and didnt get knocked
about i was really comfortable and what was more i could use my hands
that was no end of a blessing i had picked up a few ideas about drawing
you know at bolsover and found now i could do pretty wrell at it i believe 
some of my sketches at the middlesex were thought well of mary came to
see me nearly every day i could see she was getting poorer and poorer and
when at last i was discharged the rooms she took me to were about as poor
as they could be to be respectable

     id hardly been back a week when one day after going out to trj to
sell some of my sketches she came home ill and died quite suddenly

i was all up a tree then-no money no friends no legs i wrote to framp-
ton but he cant have got my letter then i got threatened with eviction and
all but left out in the street when the person old mary had sold my sketches
to called around and ordered some more i didnt see him but a brute of a
woman who lived in the house did and was cute enough to see she could make
a good thing out of me so she took possession of me and ever since then
ive been a prisoner cut off from the outside world as completely as if i had
been in a dungeon grinding out pictures by the dozen and never seeing a
farthing of what they fetched except iu the food which black sal provided
to keep me alive now and then in an amiable mood she would get me a
newspaper and once i had to illustrate a cheap edition of cooks voyages
and of course had the book to go by but she never let me write to anybody
or see anybody and mounted guard over me as jealously as if i had been a
veritable goose that laid golden eggs

    you know the rest we got turned out when they pulled down the old
place and took refuge in drivers alley a nice select neighborhood and
there you found me old man

    think of being near one another so long said jeffreys and never
knowing it 
living it down



    ten to one thats exactly what my guardians daughter is observing to
herself at the present moment i say jeff compared with drivers court
this is a palatial apartment and you are a great improvement on black sal
but for all that dont you look forward to seeing a little civilization-to
eating with a fork for instance and-oh jeff it will be heavenly to wear a
clean collar 

   jeffreys laughed

    your two years troubles havent cast out the spirit of irreverence
youngster said he

   it is jolly to hear myself called youngster said the boy in a paren-
thesis  it reminds me o f the good old days  

     before bolsover  said jeffreys sadly

    look here  if jou go back to that again and pull any more of those
long faces jeff ill be angry with you wasnt all that affair perhaps a
blessing in the long run  it sent me to a school thats done me more good
than bolsover  and as for you-well but for it youd never have had that
sweet visitor this morning

    dont talk of that that is one of the chief drawbacks to my going
back to civilization as you call it

    a very nice drawback if its the only one-

     its not  theres another

      what is that  

    my babies 

chapter xlih-a cloudless sky

    it was a strange happy night that last in the storr alley garret jeffreys
had begged raby to let them stay where they were in peace for that day  and
she considerately kept their counsel till the morning then she told her father
the strange story

    two birds with one stone and such a stone ejaculated the bewildered
colonel

    four birds father-there are two babies as well

    whew  said the colonel  what a holiday i am having  

     poor father said the girl  its too bad

   oh well the more the merrier whats to be done now wed
better charter a coach and four and a brass band and go and fetch them
home in haste if they wait until tomorrow we would have a triumphal arch 

     how frivolous you are father  we must get them away with as little
fuss as possible i arranged with mr jeffreys that he would bring mr
forrester here in a cab this morning

      and the babies  

      he will go back for them afterwards  

    well as you like  but what about percy and the rimbolts  

    percy was to go out of town today you know and will not be back till
tomorrow by that time we shall be able to find out what mr jeffreys would
like best


living it down

     oh very good well wait till his royal highness signifies his pleas-
ure and meanwhile our relatives and friends must be avoided-thats what
you mean   

     no said raby coloring   but you know how easily frightened he is

    the colonel laughed pleasantly

    all right raby they shall be let down as easily as you like now
shall i be in the way when they come or shall i make myself scarce  and
by the way i must go at once and get a perambulator and feeding bottles
and all that sort of thing how many times a day am i to be sent out to
take them for walks 

    youre too silly for anything said raby dutifully

   she was grateful to him for making things so easy and by covering her
own ill disguised embarrassment by this adroit show of frivolity

   there was no frivolity in the manner in which the gallant soldier wel-
comed his old comrades son when an hour later he entered the house
borne in the strong arms of his friend a couch wras ready for him and
everything was made as simple and homelike as possible jeffreys stayed
long enough to help the boy into the civilized garments provided for him
and then quietly betook himself once more to storr alley

   the curiosity roused by the departure of black sals forrester in a
cab was redoubled when late that afternoon jeffreys was seen walking out
of the alley with the baby in one arm and tim holding on to the other he
had considered it best to make no public announcement of his departure if
he had he might have found it more difficult than it was to take the impor-
tant step as it was he had to run the gauntlet of a score of inquisitive
idlers who were by no means satisfied with the assurance that he was going
to give the children an airing

    the general opinion seemed to be that he was about to take the children
to the poor house and a good deal of odium was worked up in consequence
some went so far as to say he was going to sell or drown the infants  and
others drivers alley refugees promised him a warm reception if he re-
turned without them

   he neither returned with nor without them they saw him no more
but it was given to the respectable inhabitants of a crescent near regents
park about half an hour later to witness the spectacle of a big young man
carrying a small baby in his arms and a big one on his shoulder-for tim
had turned restive on his hands-walk solemnly along the footpath till he
reached the door of colonel athertons where he rang

   the colonel and raby had a queer tea party that evening when the
meal was ended jeffreys was called upon to put his infants to bed and a
wonderful experience to those small mortals was the warm bath and feather
bed to which they were severally introduced jeffreys was thankful that
the baby was restless and gave him an excuse for remaining in retirement
the most of the evening at length however silence reigned  and he had
no further call to tarry

   entering the parlor he perceived almost with a shock that mr rimbolt
was there he had called in accidentally and had just been told the news
living it down



    my dear fellow said he as he took his old librarians hand  how we
have longed for this day   

   raby aud her father were occupied with forrester and jeffreys and his
old employer were left undisturbed

   what they talked about i need not repeat it chiefly had reference to
storr alley and to percy

    he is down at watford seeing a friend tonight we expect him back
tomorrow morning how happy he will be  by the way added mr
rimbolt a moment afterwards  now i remember there is a train leaves
euston for overton at  half an hour after percys train comes in how
should you like to meet him and run down with him for a week or two to
wildtree  he sadly wants a change and my books sadly want looking after
there you will have the place to yourselves  but perhaps you wont mind
jeffreys flushed with pleasure at this proposal it was the very program
he would have selected but for a moment his face clouded as he glanced
towards forrester

    i dont know whether i ought to leave him

     he is with his guardian you know and could not be in better quarters 

  then-you know i have-that is you know-there are two-babies  
raby however when the question was subsequently discussed expressed
herself fully equal to the care of these promising infants until a home could
be found for them  and forrester for his part declared that jeffreys must
and should go to wildtree

    cant you see i dont want you any more   said he this sofas so
comfortable im certain i shall sleep a fortnight straight away and then my
guardian and i have  end of business to talk over havent we guardian
and roud really be in the way

    so it was settled the whole part retired early to bed after their exciting
day

    jeffreys slept for the last time between the babies and could scarcely be-
lieve when he awoke that he was not still in storr alley

   still less could tim when he awoke realize where he was for the john
he was accustomed to stood  longer in his weather beaten tattered gar-
ments but in the respectable librarians suit which he had left behind him
at clarges street and which now by some mysterious agency found itself
transferred to his present room

   tim resented the change and bellowed vehemently for the space of an
hour being joined at intervals by his younger brother and egged  by the
mocking laughter of young forrester who was enjoying the exhibition in an
adjoining chamber

   for once jeffreys could do nothing with his disorderly infants and was
compelled finally to carry them down one under each arm to the sitting
room where raby came to the rescue and thus established her claim on their
allegiance for a week or so to come

   in a strange turmoil of feeling jeffreys at midday walked to euston mr
rimbolt was there with percys traveling bag aud the tickets but he did not
remain till the train from westford came in


living it down

    i may be running down to the north myself in about a fortnight said
he   we can leave business till then-good by  

   the train came in at last jeffreys could see the boy pacing in a non-
chalant way down the platform evidently expecting anything but this
meeting

   his eyes seemed by some strange perversity even to avoid the figure
which stood waiting for him  nor was it till jeffreys quietly stepped in front
of him and said  percy that they took him in and blazed forth a delighted
recognition

    jeff he said  youve come back-really

    yes really

   to stay-for good

    for good old fellow

   percy heaved a sigh of mighty content as he slipped his arm into that of
his friend and half an hour later the two were whizzing northward on their
way to wildtree with their troubles all behind them

chapter xljv-a fresh start

   it is supposed to be the duty of every well conducted author after the
curtain has fallen on the final tableau of his little drama to lift it or half lift
it for a momentary last glimpse of the principal actors

   i am not quite sure whether this is not an encouragement to laziness on
the part of the reader in most respects he is as well able to picture the
future of jeffreys and raby and percy and tim as i am

   i cannot show them to you in all the dignity of an honored old age be-
cause they are only a year or two older today than they were when percy
and jeffreys took that little run together down to cumberland nor can i
show them to you after the fashion of the fairy tale  married and living
happily ever afterwards because when i met jeffreys in the strand the
other day he told me that although he had just been appointed to the
control of a great public library in the north it would still be some months
possibly a year before he would be able to set up house on h is own account

   however he seemed contented on the whole to wait a bit and in a long
talk we had as we walked up and down the embankment i heard a good
many scraps of information which make it possible to satisfy the reader on
one or two points about which he may still be anxious

   jeffreys and percy stayed at wildtree for a month and that time was one
of the happiest both of them ever spent they did nothing exciting they
read some aristophanes  and added some new   dodge   to their wonderful
automatic bookcase they went up wild pike one bright winters day and
had a glorious view from the top and on the ledge coming back they sat
and rested awhile on a spot they both remembered well julius grave was
not forgotten when they reached the valley below  and the  j  upon the
stone which marks the place to this day was their joint work for an hour that
afternoon

   as for the books jeffreys had sprung towards them on his first arrival as
living it down



a father springs toward his long lost family they were sadly in want of
dusting and arranging as for a month or two  one had been near them
and altogether jeffreys had work enough to keep him busy

   he was not sorry to be busy for amid all the happiness and comfort of
his new return to life he had many cares on his mind

   there was forrester he had imagined that if he could only find him
all would be right the past would be canceled and his bad name would never
again trouble him but as he thought of the helpless cripple lying there
unable to move without assistance with all his prospects blighted and his
very life a burden to him he began to realize that the past was not canceled
that he had a lifes debt yet to pay and a lifes wrong yet to atone for but
he bravely faced his duty now forresters letters which came frequently
certainly did not do much to encourage melancholy reflections

   im in clover here the boy wrote about a week after jeffreys had
gone north   my guardian is a trump-and is never tired of telling me about
my father do you know im to have a pension from a grateful country 

     here am i writing about myself when i know you are longing to
hear about-turn over leaf and hide your blushes-the babies  they
are tip top timothy ever since i got my sword has shown great respect
for me and sits  the pillow while i sketch by the way do you recognize
inclosed portrait its my first attempt at a face-rather a pleasant face too

   she by the way never mentions you which is an excellent sign but
rather tough on me when i want to talk about you she occasionally is
drawn out to talk about a certain mr john at storr alley but as you know
she only knew about him from hearsay hows that boy who got hold of
you down in cumberland are he aud i to be friends or enemies tell
him im game for either aud give him choice of weapons if the latter but
as long as he lets me see you now and then and treats you well we may as
well be friends im flourishing and awfully in love stay away as long as
you can youre not wanted here good by-remember me to that chap tim
sends his duty and she when i mentioned i was writing to you and asked if
there was any message did not hear what i said-g f 

    there was plenty in this bright letter to give comfort to jeffreys he rejoiced
humbly in its affectionate tone toward himself he treasured the portrait
he was gratified at the unenvious references to percy and he was relieved at
the prospect before his babies

   at the end of a month mr rimbolt wrote to say he was coming down
to wildtree aud would be glad if they would meet him at overton

   they did so and found that he was not alone mr halgrove stepped
pleasantly out of the train at the same time and greeted his quondam ward
with characteristic ease

   ah jeffreys-here we are again im always meeting you at odd
places how fresh everything looks after the rain 

    mr halgrove is my brother in law you know jeffreys said mr rim-
bolt in response to his librarians blank look of consternation i brought
him down as he wanted to see you and have a talk if you two would like
to walk added he  percy and i will drive on and have dinner ready


living it down

   good hearted fellow rimbolt said mr halgrove

    yes said jeffreys greatly puzzled by this unexpected meeting

   yes i told him once casually about an unpleasant ward i once had
whom i rather disliked i thought he would sympathize with nie when i
related how delicately i had got rid of him and sent him adrift when it did
not suit me to keep him any longer would you believe it rimbolt wasnt
at all sympathetic but asked what had become of my ward s money  do
take warning jeffreys and avoid the bad habit of asking inconvenient ques-
tions you have no idea of the pain they may cause mr rimbolts ques-
tion pained me excessively because my wards money like himself had
gone to the bad that would not have been of much consequence were it
not that i was responsible for its going to the bad it was most inconvenient
altogether i assure you it made me feel as if i had behaved not quite well
in the matter  and you know how depressing such a feeling would be still
more inconvenient at the time when i had this talk with rimbolt about six
months ago i had just come back from america with my finances in not at
all a flourshing condition so that even if i had been disposed to refund my
ward i could not have done it happily he was lost it was an immense
relief to me i can assure you

     two months ago my finances looked up i unexpectedly found myself
a man of means again rimbolt who certainly has the knack of making ill
timed suggestionsproposed that that would be a good opportunity for making
good what properly belonged to my ward i urged in vain that my ward
was lost and that the money properly belonged to me as a reward for the
trouble i had had in the matter he actually insisted that i should deposit
with him as trustee for my ward the full amount of what belonged to him
with interest added to date promising if by any unfortunate accident the
fellow should be found to see it into his hands ones obliged to humor rim-
bolt so i did what he wanted and thats how it stands if ever this unprofit-
able ward turns up hed better keep his eye on rimbolt

   there you see jeffreys thats just a little anecdote to show you how
easy it is by being inconsiderate for one person to make another uncomfort-
able but now tell us how you like cumberland

   jeffreys admitted that he was much pleased with it and had the tact to suit
his humor to that of his guardian and not refer further to the lost money

   mr halgrove only stayed two days and then departed for the great
west where it is possible he may today carry a lighter heart about with him
for his latest act of reparation

   one afternoon a week later jeffreys was walking with raby in regents
park

   it was not exactly a chance walk they had both been up to the orphan-
age at hampstead with the reluctant tim and his brother to leave them
there in motherly hands till the troubles of infancy should be safely passed

   it was tim who hadjnsisted on having the escort of both his natural guar-
dians on the occasion  and at such a time and on such an errand tims word
was law so they had gone all four in a cab and now raby and jeffrejs
returned and with a sense of bereavement through the park
when love begins

   was it accident or what which brought them without knowing it to a
spot which to each was full of painful memories 

   raby was the first to stop abruptly

   let us go another way mr jeffreys if you dont mind i dont like
this avenue  

    no more do i said jeffreys who had stopped too

    why she said

    need i say 

    not if you dont like

 i have not walked down here since an afternoon last october there

was a sudden storm of rain-

    what  were you here then 

    i was you did not see me

    you saw me then i was with mr scarfe

  yes you were-

    miserable and angry said she her face kindling at the recollection

   he darted one glance at her as brief as that he had darted on the after-
noon of which they spoke

   then he had read nothing but despair for himself  now though her eyes
were downcast and her voice angry he thought he read hope

    suppose said he in a little while  instead of running away from
the path we just walk down it together would you mind are you
afraid  

    no said she smiling and they walked on

when love begins

        when love begins the pulses go
        no longer sluggish tame or slow

                  but looking down from heights of bliss
                  man learns to know what rapture is
                  and all his feelings finer grow

        how very gay the ardent beau

                  how all his thoughts with fervor glow 
                  what woudrous happiness is his
                  when love begins 

        ah there is one who can bestow

        the ecstasy i fain would show-

        a beauteous captivating miss-

                   you smile clarisse ill take a kiss

a courageous coward

the sequel to an unaccepted challenge-why little binks refused to figlit the major-the
opportunity for his strange revenge and in what manner binks
made use of it

thky called him little binks in the regiment not to his face though
for almost every one liked him too well not that biaks was exactly
a small man physically but he was short-stocky so to speak-with
rather broad shoulders and long arms disproportionate to his height

   little binks had peculiarities-who of us has not but his were of a
nature that in a roistering regiment like the one which he had joined at the
opening of the zulu campaign made him at first a trifle unpopular with his
fellow officers

   little binks was alone in the world he hadnt any one at home not
even a sweetheart he had so it was whispered been engaged to a lovely
girl who had thrown him over for major trevitt and the major of
course knew all about it

   the zulu army had gathered in force near the border of the mazembi
districts barrows mounted infantry with an artillery corps and three com-
panies of the thirteenth dragoons were holding the fortifications only a mile
away anxiously awaiting reinforcements and there were rumors that the
zulus were meditating a sudden onslaught which should sweep the few hand-
fuls of british invaders from the sandy soil

   a dozen or more of the thirteenth among whom were little binks and
major trevitt sat discussing the situation in front of the rude native bar-
racks in the glow and splendor of an african moonlight

   major trevitt a tolerably abstemious man according to his light was
disposed to be somewhat sentimental and remarkably self complacent after
having disposed of a trifle more than his usual allowance

   binks who sat a little apart was unusually silent perhaps his thoughts
were thousands of miles away from zululand possibly he was thinking of
the one bright episode in an otherwise lonely life i mean of course the
days when the fair but fickle alice ritchie had smiled-or seemed to-on his
suit of course for a little while he had lived in a fools paradise like many
a wiser man but unlike the wiser man above mentioned little binks had
never lost his faith in or his love for the girl who had thrown him aside as
she would a slightly worn glove his belief in her was unbounded-he would
have died to serve her

   alice it was major trevitts voice elevated a trifle above its usual
pitch in answer to something said by one of those next him-a very intimate
friend and fellow officer
a courageous coward

 

    well yes my boy he went on in the same audible tones which some-
how little binks had a fancy were intended for his own ear   i rather
flatter myself that her life so to speak is wrapped up in yours truly point
of fact she said in her last letter that it would simply break her heart out-
right if anything happened to your humble servant in this campaign

   pleasant for little binks who firmly believed every word  major
trevitts friend was less credulous perhaps he coughed drily and made
no immediate response

    she never eared for binks dont you know continued the major who
was unusually indiscreet this evening  it was a bit of coquetry just to lead
the poor fellow -little binks is hardty the figure of a man to-

    i think youve said quite enough major trevitt  

   lieutenant binks seemed quite six feet in height as rising from his camp
stool he walked to the side of the astonished officer and broke in upon his
conversation

   no need to describe what followed the angry sneering reply the hot
words the blow 

   major trevitt whose sunburned cheek was tingling from the contact of
little binks fingers smartly applied loudly demanded  the satisfaction due
from one gentleman to another while friends vainly tried to intercede
but to the surprise of all little binks would neither fight nor apologize

    the one is against my principles and the other against my inclination
he said quietly and the word coward i regret to say was heard from
more than one pair of bearded lips-notably from major trevitts but little
binks only closed his own a little tighter and retired to his quarters

   it was a little after day dawn on the following morning when lieutenant
binks having posted his videttes under his own personal supervision rode
forward a short distance in the direction of a line of blue gum trees beyond
which the enemy were presumed to be massing in force but everything
looked quiet and peaceful in fact binks saw no sign of life in any direction
he was about bringing out his field glass when major trevitt rode up from
an opposite direction at a sharp trot little binks gravely saluted the major
scowled

    if you want my plain unvarnished opinion of you lieutenant binks
he said with gathering wrath  i repeat what i said last night-joure an
infernal coward and-

   all at once from a ruined kraal half hidden in the underbrush between
the two officers and the blue gum tree forest there belched forth a tremen-
dous fusillade major trevitt wheeled his horse sharply round but a ball
struck the animal in the fore shoulder while another passed through the
majors bridle arm shattering the bone

  little binks sprang from his saddle like a cat just in time to prevent the
officer from being crushed by his falling steed

    save yourself you thundering fool  growled the major as following
the volley came a yelling shrieking throng of half naked zulus brandishing
their assegais while at the same time another lot in ambush kept up a con-
tinuous fire


a fairy tale

   if binks heard he did not heed

  you are wounded-into my saddle quick he exclaimed in tones
hardly recognizable so full of stern command were they

   but the major was a fine figure of a man while binks himself was not a
particularly light weight and binks horse by no means a strong one
was entirely unused to carrying double he balked aud reared in fact
refused duty entirely there was but one resource-but one life could be
saved

    good by trevitt god bless you-and alice tell her good by

   as one in a dream major trevitt heard or thought he heard these words
uttered in his dulled ear

   by his own account the major only remembered lurching heavily forward
to the saddlebow which he clutched with a literal death grip the horse
relieved of part of his burden galloped madly forward into the lines hastened
perhaps by the sting of a spent bullet that struck the frightened steed in the
counter

   major trevitt was in a half unconscious state from pain snd loss of blood
when helped from the saddle and it was not until the zulus had been
driven back to the kraal that little binks was discovered

   in his right hand was a revolver with empty cylinder through his
heart was an african assegai and about him lay grim and ghastly the life-
less bodies of five of cetewayos bravest zulu warriors

   so little binks lies asleep under african sands at his head is a simple
gray stone for which major trevitt paid at his own special request but
little binks brother officers insisted upon supplying the words following
his name and the date of his death is this 

    brave men do not boast or bluster deeds not words speak for such

a fairy tale

                   we sat on the fences topmost rail
                   as the sun sank in the west

                   and told each other some fairy tale

                 which when young we loved the best
                 and the long grass rustled at our feet 

                  mayhap in its tangle green
                  titania and her courtly suite

                                 listened unseen

                  the twilight gathered-the fields grew dark
                  the night let her curtains down

                 the stars came out-each tiny spark
                 like the jewel of a crown

                  the fair moon shone in the heavens above
                  and beneath its glory pale
                  a maiden smiled for she thought my love
