opalori assidy jeturn clarence e mulford great western character appears again stop wondering how i teach ill show you free year after year youve seen my advertisement in all the leading publications offering to teach you piano in quarter the usual time
year after year my school has grown and grown until now i have far
more students than were ever before taught by one man in  over
two thousand students graduated from my piano or organ course and
received their diplomas
  yet when i first started giving piano and organ lessons by mail in
 my method was laughed at could my conservatory have grown
as it has obtained students in every state of the union and in fact
practically every civilized country of the world unless it produced very
unusual and satisfying results for its students see for yourself
what it is that has brought my method so rapidly to the front write
for free booklet and sample lessons
  now for the first time you can obtain sample lessons without charge
in the past i have always been opposed to sending out free lessons
even to persons who were seriously interested in my course but my
friends have insisted that i give everybody a chance to see for them-
selves just how simple interesting and different my lessons are
and i have consented to try the experiment for a short time simply
mail the coupon below or write a postcard and the -page booklet
and sample lessons will go to you at once absolutely free and without
obligation
within four lessons you will play an interesting piece on the piano or
organ not only in the original key but in all other keys as well most
students practise months before they acquire this ability it is made
possible by my patented invention the colorotone another inven-
tion obtainable only from me is my hand-operated moving pic-
ture device quinn-dox by means of quinn-dex you actually
see my fingers in motion on the piano and can learn just
how to train your own fingers
piano
     when i say that i can teach you piano in quarter the
i a usual time do not think that this is too good to bo
o true modern inventions and improved methods
 w voo
have accomplished just as great wonders in other
jso branches of education you at least owe it to
yourself to investigate send coupon or post-
o	carl at once before the offer of free
sample lessons is withdrawn

i was at the end of my rope
we
e lived in a fairly comfortable home
but it was a terrific struggle to make both
nds meet i couldnt save a cent and i
was deeper in debt than  dared confess to my wife
  i hadnt had a decent raise in years and there
were nights-too many of them now-when i lay
awake for hours wondering what we would do if
 ever lost my position
  for other men were getting ahead of me and i
knew that i couldnt stand still  either hail to
go up or down and i was afraid it was going to
be down
  then suddenly one night it came to me like a
hash that the reason i wasnt getting anywhere
was mainly because i had never made any definite
effort to make myself more valuable to the firm
   knew my own little routine job but that was
all  was just one of the force to my employers
there was really no reason why they should think
of me when a better position was open
  that night i made my decision if the i c s
can raise the salaries of other men  said to my-
self it cai raise mine if it can help other men
to win promotion and have happier more prosper-
ous homes it can help me too to-night right
now im going to send in that coupon and find out
what the i c s can do for me
  it was the best move i ever made my employ-
ers heard about my studying and started to take
an interest in me six months after i enrolled with
the i c s i received my first increase in salary
within two years i was head of my department
and im going still higher

vol clvi	saturday december   	number 
 by clarence e mulford
 in december  hopalong cassidy and his ranch mates appeared in print for
 the first time in the old outing magazine in a story called  the fight at buck-
 skin this story established hopalong and his friends and was followed by
 more which later came out in book form as  bar- other series of bar- tales
 ran from time to time in various magazines until over forty had been published with
 never one refused these in turn came out in book form under the titles bar-
 days  and  the coming of cassidy  and made hosts of readers and friends
     with this encouragement mr mulford turned to the more serious form and
 made the characters appear in the novels  hopalong cassidy  the man from
 bar-  johnny nelson  tex ewalt  the bar- three and  buck peters
 ranchman thinking that he had used the same characters enough mr mulford
 left them and turned to new ones but he found that his readers still wanted the old
 bar- crowd he began to get letters protesting against shelving the bar- outfit
 and they came from all parts of the world where english is read his books are
  a	

argosy-allstory weekly
published in england canada australia new south wales and throughout the
british empire and the bar- books without exception are still going strong
negotiations are now in progress for the scandinavian rights  bar- in which
the characters made their first appearance in book form shows no let up in the
demand for it despite its eighteen years
     at first mr mulford did not take the letters seriously in regard to putting the
old characters to work again but now he is setting the stage in the argosy-alistory
magazine for hopalong cassidy the old bar- leader and his inseparable friend
red connors keeping in mind that they have been growing older to many people
these characters purely fictional are real episodes existing only in the imagination
of the author have been recognized by some readers as actual occurrences one ranch-
man in arizona refused point blank to believe that mr mulford had not been at
one time a member of his outfit thoroughly well acquainted with every man in it
and with every part of his ranch he based his statements on certain things which
he read in  hopalong cassidy and is not convinced of his error to this day
another man in the west wrote for  shortys  present address evidently recogniz-
ing an old acquaintance posing under a different name in one of mr mulfords stories
he explained that he understood the wisdom of keeping  shorty  incognito on
being told the truth he refused to believe it and asked the author to forward a letter
from him to  shorty if he would not tell where  shorty  was to be found natu-
rally mr mulford could not do this and repeated his former statements but they
were not believed and his correspondent became vexed the letters grew hot and
mr mulford dropped the correspondence
    the new hopalong cassidy series which is superior to anything that mr mul-
ford has ever written along similar lines will contain ten stories all of which will
appear in the pages of this magazine whether or not the characters are alive or
dead or ever existed is of little importance a million readers accept them for their
worth and are delighted that they appear in print and work out their romantic and
adventuresome destinies
     the snakes  is the opening installment of the series and follows herewith
                                                         the editor
i-the snakes
t y e aint crossin no desert
x snapped red with an emphasis
 v which is safe only when used
with friends  we aint even got this south
visit over yet it  be near a month when
we start back for th sv but yore itchin
for speed already th whole summer an
part of th fall will be ahead of us you
only made up yore mind three hours ago
to ride north an now yore worryin be-
cause we aint halfway there i alius said
you was a damn fool 
   montannys a long way off rejoined
hopalong doggedly
   taint no further off from here than
this place was from montanny countered
red glaring  cornin down from th
railroad last year you made us cross that
blasted desert because you itched to see
johnny agin what th devil you itchin
about now
  hopalong looked off to one side the lines
of his weather-beaten sun-browned wind-
toughened face deepening and into his eyes
came an expression that was pitiful he
could see two graves on a wind-swept mon-
tana hillside-a large grave and a small
one he gulped and his companions side-
wise glance saw the adams apple rise and
fall
  red shook his head sadly and looked
straight in front wondering if he ever could
get his friends thoughts off the loss which
had changed him so to lose ones wife
and child-he bit his lip he had a wife
and a bright-eyed little girl up there in
montana whom he had not seen for a year
and it had been his secret hope that his
girl and hopalong cassidys mischievous
boy-but it was all done with now
  for many years ever since red had re-
turned from the texas gulf-coast range
hopalong cassidy returns

with supplies so necessary to the little bar-
 ranch just beginning its existence on
snake creek and found hopalong cassidy
getting out of trouble the two had shared
a friendship which nothing ever had cooled
again and again each had risked his own
life for the other they had shared priva-
tions dangers hunger and thirst together
many times they had side by side looked
death in the eye and told it to go to hell
mutual sacrifices had been nearly as com-
mon as the days work this friendship
had been their religion the sacrifices the
solemn rites
  neither had ever told the other in words
that he was anything more than a mangy
coyote or a cross-eyed cow thief knowing
both to be lies never had either assured
the other of his friendship and their verbal
endearments had taken the form of abuse
but god help any outsider who borrowed
a leaf from that book
  for the last year red had ridden close
herd on his friend forsaking all others to
ride doggedly and unquestioningly at the
side of the man who had lost so much
gradually hopalongs steady dejection had
faded and he was beginning to show signs
of becoming his old self although red was
not fool enough to believe that the rever-
sion would be anywhere near complete at
times there came a look on his friends face
that told red that no matter how little
hopalong had feared death in the old days
he feared it much less now and once in a
while the look said more than that and
red stuck to him like a shadow now that
they had decided to return to montana
after their visit to the old bar- ranch
and its neighborhood red was beginning
to wonder what the end of that long trail
would do for his friend he plainly could
see those two graves on the hillside
  the bobbing adams apple sent red
back into one of his old stand-bys and he
continued his growling about deserts an old
bone of contention between them
   nothin but lizards gilas horned
toads side-winders an th like has got any
use for a desert but you aint got sense
enough to know when yore well off
taint that yore gettin childish hell you
was alius that way
  if i had yore disposition- began
hopalong with warming interest
   it d be plumb ruined by now inter-
rupted red
   id go hang myself continued hopa-
long  you can kick up more damn fuss
about a little desert than any man i ever
knowed 
   why wouldnt i demanded red
glaring  for near twenty years youve
knowed i hate a desert worsen i do a hoss
thief but for near twenty years you aint
been happy unless you was draggin me
over one if theres any in these united
states that you aint fried me on its only
because you aint never heard tell of it
youve even drug me into mexico an fried
me there im tellin you we aint crossin
no deserts we can ride around thats flat
   flat as yore head retorted hopalong
he glanced at the repeating winchester in
his friends saddle scabbard and sneered
  red looked at the huge single-shot
sharps in hopalongs saddle sheath and
snorted
   huh said hopalong
  huh said red
  after a ride in pugnacious silence hop-
along grunted and cleared his throat
   mebby were a pair of fools to ride
back to th old ranch he said  it  be
terrible changed therell be wire fences
irrigatin ditches dams railroads school -
houses an churches it  mebby make us
sick
   we usually are a pair of fools when
were together replied red  reckon
well find any of th old crowd on th other
ranches
   dont know but we got to go an find
out
   whats th cow country cornin to any-
how demanded red with feeling
   to a better land answered hopalong
thoughtfully  might as well be honest
about it much as it hurts its crops an
towns an schoolhouses that make a coun-
try but it shore is an awful dose to swal-
ler times are changin red were outa
step
  reds amazement at his friends calm
acceptance of what was to him a calamity
was too much for words

argosy-allstory weekly
   you hear a lot of bellerin from old-
time cowmen about th good old days bein
gone forever continued iiopalong  they
were good old days for cowmen an they
done their part they had to be an they
had to go of course it  be a long time
before th open range is all gone th
edges  go first an along th streams an
railroads its th last that  count an
count fast it would take a long time for
th farmers to work through th cow coun-
try if they could only inch in from th
edges but now that theyre workin both
ways in th middle of th range from three
four railroads it  move fast you dont
reckon id a let william jr grow up to
be a cow-puncher do you if hed lived
  red muffled a curse there it was
again swinging back to the one thought
uppermost hopalong had taken delight in
looking forward to the training of his son
to making an upstanding man out of him
he had molded johnny nelson into a man
who was a credit to any community and
he had been anxious to mold his son into
another red changed the subject
   when we get through down south an
get back to th sv are we stayin very long
with johnny or pushin right on
   well stay a day or two replied hop-
along his face clouding johnny nelson
was very close to his heart  funny how
a man changes his mind when we left
montanny last year for th sv i figgered
i could spend th rest of my days there
huh red do you know that were just a
couple of tramps respectable an above
stealin an beggin but tramps just th
same what chance has a breed like ourn
got thats alius rollin on to hold th range
agin a bunch like nesters that settle down
an take root were tramps were like-
wise a pair of fools who but two fools
would start from th sv to ride hoss-back
to montanny theres railroads aint
there
  red flared  yes but whod ride on
th damn things while he had a cayuse
you know whatd happen to th railroads
if i had my way dont you
  hopalong laughed  aint no use bitin
me carrot-top i hate em worsen you
do we admits we hate em but so does
folks hate nasty medicine they take it
just th same only two fools would choose
cayuses an a trail near two thousan miles
long when they could go by train
  this was the task they had set for them-
selves after their return to the sv for a
few days visit they would start for another
ranch up in montana where most of their
old-time outfit worked for their old-time
foreman and where range conditions were
more to their liking spring had come
upon them and tempted them to make the
journey on horseback since their time was
their own and they both hated trains to
go over the old trails again keeping spring
with them part of the way would be worth
the effort- to live over in memory days that
would come no more and to review condi-
tions already past to test their memories
of trails and old-time fords to find dead
towns which they once had known alive
and new towns where none had been all
this was a sufficient lure and did not need
the added zest of possible adventures which
might be dumped out on them from fates
big bag they had plenty of money were
accustomed to long distances in the saddle
and to hardships and they looked forward
to that ride with a keen eagerness
   tramps huh grunted red scowling
  tramps said hopalong nodding
  they topped a hill and started down the
slope toward a nesters house situated in a
mess of barbed wire his land was di-
vided into small parcels bearing different
kinds oj crops and each was separated from
those around it by three strands of wire
the outer inclosing fence was of five
strands
   betcha hes got a barb-wire watch
chain growled red in strong disgust
   betcha hes been pestered sick by
cows chuckled hopalong who knew that
hatred for the nester  still hate em
dont you carrot-top
   no moren you do  retorted red sav-
agely
   yes answered his companion  i
still hate em though i know im wrong
habit i reckon just th same theyre
tryin to make a livin th only way they
know how theyre makin th country
an theyve come to stay
hopalong cassidy returns

  after tying their animals a safe distance
from the outer fence they headed for the
house and had to open and close three
gates all liberally strung with barbed wire
as they reached the porch they heard a hail
and looked up to see a man running toward
them
  got em yet called the nester care-
fully climbing a barbed wire fence
   loco grunted hopalong
   most nesters are replied red dog-
matically looking at the fences as if they
were proof of his statement  ever see so
much wire on so little ground
   did they git away asked the nester
climbing another fence he paused to
loosen carefully the seat of his trousers
from a barb  they oughta be wrapped
in a green hide an left in th sun damn
em 
   lots he knows about a green hide
muttered red
   heard tell about em i reckon re-
plied his companion
  safely over the last fence the nester hur-
ried toward them but stopped short a few
paces away and stared at hopalong then
he swore softly
   damn took ye fer th sheriff an a
deppity but mebby ye are
   only a couple of pilgrims said hop-
along  stopped to get a drink an fill
our canteens so i look like th sheriff
huh
   dead ringer even to yore hoss shore
you aint him
  at their denial he looked a little sus-
picious but his expression changed as he
took in the details of their persons they
in no way resembled the descriptions of the
ferret or janssen and their red hair was
an assurance that neither was mesquite
jenkins he beamed on them and hoped
if the three desperadoes paid him a visit
they would do so before these craggy per-
sons had left the premises
   set a while strangers have a little
somethin to clear a way for th water
  the two friends grinned and nodded and
spoke the same words in unison
   dont mind if we do
   wait a shake said the host hurrying
into the house and in a few moments he
was becoming pleasantly acquainted with
his guests
   you said somethin about us gettin
somethin suggested hopalong
   yeah th snakes that robbed sim por-
ter an killed nancy smithers said the
nester and told them about the crimes
the robbery audacious as it had been was
swept out of their minds by the brutal
and revolting murder of the woman
   she must a met th ferret while he was
escapin an mebby got in his way said
their host  her throat was cut an knife
play is th ferrets long suit they say hell
kill fer th fun of watchin th blood spurt
out
  the visitors replies were appropriate
and after an hours talk the two travelers
arose and departed following their hosts
directions toward the nearest water which
was cottonwood creek
  as they paused on the top of the ridge
they smiled at the tiny pasture across the
placid stream set like a jewel between the
clean sand of the creek bed and the strag-
gling line of timber just beyond here was
grass water and fuel and here they would
spend the night the streams had been
getting farther apart and they knew they
were coming to the fringe of the desert
stretch which already had given them a
bone for their wrangling
   dont reckon we can improve on that
said hopalong scanning the pasture  we
got plenty of time an i feel like loafin th
rest of th day be good chance to wash up
too
   its mebby th last water for a long
ride rejoined red scowling as he pictured
the hated staked plain
  hopalong smiled  owin to yore bull-
headed nature we aint crossin no desert
this trip well go round it i see i gotta
humor you like a baby
   since that nester said you looked like
th sheriff youve been all swelled up re-
torted red  you aint got sense enough
to reckon that lookin like th sheriff is meb-
by dangerous around here right now he
sneered  surprised you aint never run
for sheriff
  hopalong chuckled  seein th mess
you made of th job besides near gettin

argosy-allstory weekly
married to that wallace girl i aint been
hankerin for no sheriffs job
  red flushed he was a married man now
but he did not marry stell wallace he
was glad on both counts but the way she
had led him on and then thrown him into
the discard for a preacher did not set lightly
on him this was some years before and
he had mooched around with a broken
heart fearing that it would not prove fatal
and the perspective given by the passing
of time made him smart by the picture it
showed him the picture of a red headed
fool a fool past all belief
   aint you never goin to forget nothin
that ever happened demanded red with
heat  when it comes to rakin over damn
fool things outa th past i got a two-hand
rake of my own yore th last man on
earth that wants to start any rakin when
im around an you know it couple more
peeps outa you an ill give you somethin
to listen to
  hopalong looked coldly into his friends
eyes
   some rainy day when were back with
th rest of th boys ill rake with you an
leave it to a vote you got a lot of gall blat-
tin about yore two-hand rake there aint
no man on earth thats made as many fool
plays as you have
   huh  snorted red leading the way
down the slope  you look like th sheriff
hes got my sympathy come on you
cow thief
  they wrangled down the hill across the
creek and while they put the camp in
order stopping only when they had run
out of the more prominent reminiscences of
asinine episodes but truth compels the ad-
mission that red dug up three to his com-
panions one
  hopalong looked around the camp and
then at the creek
   taint deep enough to swim in he
said  but i can get wet all over
   bout time too said red picking up
his rifle  im goin off an shoot some-
thin to eat anyhow th crick wont be fit
for me to wash in for a long time after
you get through
   huntin huh grunted hopalong
   its a good thing we get plenty of grub 
   red scorned to reply and drifted into the
brush as the best rifle shot in the south-
west he did not have to defend himself
against the slurs of any man not even the
best six-gun expert he ever had seen
  hopalong fooled around the camp but
finally undressed and went in the creek
whose waters although very warm felt
good he was generous in his use of the
soap and tossed it up on the bank rinsing
himself well before he followed it he was
parading for the sun and the wind to dry
him when a head raised behind the farther
bank and a six-gun roared
ii
  miles away from cottonwood creek
mesquite jenkins drew back from the eager
brilliant greasewood fire and looked out
across it
   like coyotes we are he growled
 eatin poor grub livin in fear of our
own shadders hangin round th edge of
th desert swallerin sand an alkali in our
eatin drinkin an breathin ive had too
damned much of it
  the little man across from him tossed
a handful of greasewood on the blaze and
watched its sizzling popping sputtering
flare
   its bettern judge lynch he mum-
bled looking at mesquite through narrowed
lids to his face came an expression re-
markably like the cunning leer of a fox
momentarily dominating his habitual ex-
pression of stark cruelty  our trails two
weeks old they lost it give em an-
other week to go back to their reglar jobs
this place just suits me
  mesquite idly picked up another plant
stem and tossed it on the fire swore at its
sudden stink smelled his fingers and looked
from the ferret to janssen the latters
broad face was expressionless almost stu-
pid for the man ran to bulk and tremendous
physical strength he was the third factor
in a temporary and deadly combination his
stolid unimaginative nature rounding out
the attributes of the trio the conversation
had made little impression on him not
enough to shift his gaze from the explosive
fire from which now came a thread of
hopalong cassidy returns

malodorous smoke the contribution of the
stinkweed
   yeah drawled mesquite  reckon
it would suit you to me it stinks like
that pointing to the poorly burning stink-
weed stem he pulled out his tobacco sack
dumped the few grains of fine dry dust
in his hand and then hurled dust and sack
into the fire  huh suits you he
sneered
  the swede awkwardly tossed his own
sack at mesquites crossed legs
   ders some he grunted placidly
  mesquite tossed it back again his scowl-
ing face a gargoyle in the flickering fire-
light but before it struck the ground the
ferrets lean hand darted out and caught
it the greediness of the motion and the
look on his face deepened mesquites sneer
and the youngster continued
   im ridin on real soon they couldnt
a got a look at our clothes in that light
an all they can remember of our faces is
th handkerchiefs we made a mistake
leavin town at all i want smokin an im
goin to get it
  the ferret grinned and his grin was
something which mesquite was beginning to
regard with a curious and flaming hatred
it was too oily too smirky too ingratiating-
ly greasy patently false to the real nature
of the man mesquite knew him to be as
coldly ferocious as the animal whose name
he had been given that he loved cruelty
and blood as much as any member of the
weasel family something in the youths
nature rebelled at everything the other
stood for he eyed the grin recognized its
obvious hypocrisy and thought that the
fox in his companion was becoming too
plain these days the grin was thoroughly
foxlike but the little eyes burning like coals
under the sloping forehead gave it the lie
no matter what traits he might endeavor
to assume the ferret was a ferret still each
of these men had their share of the rob-
bery and for some days mesquite had de-
tected something in the ferrets eyes that
he did not like
   thats all right for you cunningly
replied the ferret serenely confident of out-
witting this youth who had not yet reached
twenty  yore built like eight out of ten
of th men youll meet theres two dozen
like you in both them towns you could a
slipped into th line-up at any bar an been
safe janssen an me couldnt there aint
another man hereabouts that looks like
either of us where you aimin to ride to
   johnsville answered mesquite  an
then im goin on to a ranch-alone
   yohnsville ban best grunted janssen
    sheriffs just as likely to be there as at
cactus said the ferret his beady eyes
sparkling with a sudden thought his gun-
fighting companion banking on his average
stature overlooked one thing and that was
enough to hang him even during his short
stay in the town he had been identified with
the seven-foot swede and the little wizened
man and both the latter had been glimpsed
in their get-away they had left town by
different directions and met again when
well beyond it but the ferret had let his
lust for killing turn a robbery into some-
thing which had aroused the whole country
to a pitch of rage beyond all precedent
this his companions did not know and he
dared not tell them but he was over jealous
of the secret overalert to keep it hidden
so suspicious of careless words and looks
that he had aroused a feeling of distrust in
the youth
  this had grown steadily and rapidly
there was another factor that widened the
breach these three men so entirely un-
suited to each other for constant associa-
tion had been uninterruptedly together for
too long a time and little things which
would have called for a laugh in the com-
panionship of others now threatened to be-
come deadly
  mesquite looked at the little man calmly
provocatively restraining the annoying
urge of bis wizard gun hand during their
swift and hard pressed flight their twist-
ings and turnings and the cunningly con-
trived doubling under the lead of the fer-
ret which had brought them to safety under
the very noses of their enemies during the
idle loafing in this desert hiding place with-
in a days ride of either town where they
had rested while the posses searched farther
afield-during all this time mesquite had
felt his gorge rising and knew that if he
remained in the others company another

day a quarrel would flare up like the eager
flames of a greasewood fire and end in swift
death to one or both
   they must a been mad as hell to
chase us like they did commented mes-
quite thoughtfully  seemed like it was
somethin personal somethin pizen an des-
perate in every man of em i could feel
it
  the ferret closed his eyes for a moment
and then opened them to grin again and
he held the grin unchanged while the ex-
pression of the youths face made him vi-
brate with the feeling of quick close dan-
ger he estimated the distance across the
little fire but found the others eyes riveted
to his own and he dropped the lids to mask
the lust that blazed in them
   i can mebby explain that he said
chuckling to keep the others animosity
from crystallizing into a sudden exposition
of deadly sleight-of-hand he had a vast
and wondering respect for the youths draw
which baffled sight and he knew the gun-
man to be swaying perilously toward an
overt act it never would do to chance
another day with him he must be killed
while he slept
   yeah drawled mesquite softly al-
most caressingly unknowingly he was de-
liberately imitating so far as he knew a
man he had never seen
   yes we took it off sim porter with
his outfit close by it was a personal loss
an a personal insult
   huh  muttered mesquite doubtfully
 i dunno they was deadly as wolves
i could feel th hatred in th air janssen
what you think
  the swede puffed calmly at his reeking
pipe and took a long time to consider it
turning it over and over in his mind then
he shook his head  ay tank you talk
vords-yust vords
  the ferret sneered  any meanin that
aint two-plus-two would sound like words
an nothin else to him that was too sub-
tile for janssen
   ya-as maype but ay ban feel fooney
wen ay tank about das chase said
janssen hopelessly helplessly and awk-
wardly  ay dont know yust how to
say it
  mesquites glance had flashed from the
ferret to the swede and back again his
gun hand bothering him his whole body
tingling with suspicion and hostility the
ferrets lids narrowed again and the gleam
in the weazel eyes was cold and stark they
peered out through the merest slits to baf-
fle the gunmans searching gaze it must be
plain indeed if janssen felt it
  for half a minute the two stared at each
other across the noisy fire one trying to
read the other to keep him from doing it
mesquites eyes were wide open frankly
suspicious and accusing for he was so in-
tent on his visual inquiries that he forgot
to hide what he should have hidden from
the ferrets eyes only the reflected glint
from the flickering fire told that he was
watching the gunman watching almost
breathlessly the guilty knowledge of a
damnably atrocious murder did not bother
him of itself but the crime seemed to be
spreading through the darkness and calling
out his guilt for days he had not been able
to act naturally and the more he had tried
to do so the more he had failed
  mesquite appeared to relax but the fer-
ret was too cunning to be caught like that
and he only smiled his own speed of
hand for knife throwing was known to his
companions and in the mesquites wariness
he read that knowledge and a deep respect
for his deadliness then the gunman slowly
and clumsily arose from his cross-legged
position but not for an instant did he allow
himself to get into a posture which would
cramp or interfere with his draw the fer-
ret still smiled a cold sneer flickering about
his pale thin lips
  he watched mesquite pick up his saddle
and step farther and farther back into the
encircling gloom until at last only his cheek
bones greasily reflected the light of the fire
during that slow retreat the ferret frozen
by the knowledge that every added foot
operated in favor of the gun as against
the knife rigid with the knowledge that to
move to speak even to change the expres-
sion on his face might instantly crystallize
the gunmans thoughts into precipitate and
eye-baffling action knowing that he made
a fair target picked out of the darkness
by the firelight and one the other would
hopalong cassidy returns

not miss knowing that he was standing in
the open door he sat immovable his face
set his chest barely rising and falling and
as he sat there like a statue a cold rage was
flooding him from scalp to toes for this
strain and torment he some day would take
full payment
  janssen bulking huge in the light of the
hissing fire felt uncomfortable without
knowing why and shifted his position as
he looked curiously after the departing gun-
man he turned up the collar of his coat
wriggled in his loose clothing and reached
his great thick hands toward the blaze
the chill of the deserts night air seemed
to have increased swiftly in the last few
minutes
   ay ban colt he growled  trow on
some greasevood yimmy it burns like
tinder
  the ferret ignored him scarcely heard
him and kept his position unchanged the
light on the cheek bones had died out but
still he did not move there came the tin-
kle of a cinch ring striking other metal a
leathery creak and then milling hoofs but
the darkness hid all movement then the
gunmans voice reached the two at the fire
it was harsh dry strained
   so-long janssen
   vat you mean asked the swede in
surprise  you ban go away mesquite
  he listened for an answer but it did not
come when the sounds of the horse died
away he turned to his companion and then
squinted at the beads of sweat standing out
on the sloping forehead the ferrets face
glistened with moisture
   yimminy anay ban feel colt
   cornin or stayin suddenly demand-
ed the ferret bounding to his feet with
mesquite roaming in the darkness there
would be no sleep for the little man that
night unless he shifted he still tingled
with apprehension any moment fearing a
shot
   vat asked janssen astonished he
felt of the tobacco sack in his pocket and
glanced at the scanty pile of provisions at
the edge of the firelight  tought ve vas
goin to stay here a vile more
   did you grunted the ferret his mind
on other things he wiped a sleeve across
his face and glared into the night  you
damned big fool he snarled as the mean-
ing of the words crept through a rift in his
thoughts  youve been looking death in
the face an didnt have brains enough to
know it meet you a month from to-night
at the cabin an evil grin twisted his
face  mesquite wont bother us if he
goes to either of them towns hes near as
dumb as you  he whirled around and left
the fire
   i stay here a vile yet veres it safe
said janssen blinking at the fire he heard
the swift departure of another horse and
was alone on the desert emptying his
stinking pipe he reached for his blankets
ready to spend the rest of the night in deep
and tranquil sleep  vere its safe he
grunted as he snuggled down
  the desert chill grew swiftly as the fire
shrank but there remained enough of the
flickering light to glisten sinuously on some-
thing which moved sluggishly from the east
to the west along the ground a steely flex-
ible length of reflected light traveling with
a peculiar sidewise motion toward the blan-
ket swathed bulk near the fire where a
gratifying animal heat could be found
reaching the sleeping man the glistening
streak moved back and forth along the
blanket and then slowly flowed around the
upper end as the weak fire died out alto-
gether
  the sleeper stirred fumbled clumsily at
something coiled on his laboring chest then
screamed curses and clutched the writhing
sidewinder with viselike hands again and
again and again a flattened ovate head
struck viciously at the only bare skin within
its reach under which pumped the swiftly
coursing jugular stream a stream now load-
ed with jet after jet of venom

  mesquite was halfway to johnsville
when day broke and the coming of light
seemed to clarify the doubts in his mind
this was the direct way to the sv ranch
and he had ridden three hundred miles so
far to get to that ranch he had let him-
self get cleaned out at poker when he had
put up for the night in johnsville and had

argosy-allstory weekly 
been forced to stay there several days in
hope of recouping some of his losses and
necessity had thrown him in with two recent
companions they saw that he did not
starve and they got him in their debt
and then when they judged the time to be
ripe had argued him into acting as lookout
while they  turned a trick he was no
moralist he had no experience to draw
upon and the money had been obtained
easily and pointed out the way of ob-
taining more only his determination to
visit a ranch he never had seen and the
personality of the ferret had caused him
to break away from his two partners in
crime
  he followed a rock ridge to where it cut
across the cactus-johnsville trail thus leav-
ing no tracks and swung along the main
highway the prints of his horse lost in a
multitude of others the trail dipped into
a deep arroyo and twisted up the other
bank passing a narrow gully at an angle
caution made him go on foot up the east
bank to see if any travelers were in sight
and not a quarter of a mile from him rode
two men whom he knew at a glance the
sheriff and a deputy
  mesquite slipped back to his horse led
it carefully into the gully and scattered dry
leaves over the faint tracks then he hid
himself and waited for the riders to pass by
  they came steadily nearer and soon he
could make out their words
   dont know his name said the sheriff
 never saw him before he showed up in
town a couple days before th robbery
didnt take much notice of him but some
of th boys did aint no doubt he was
in it he was hangin round with th fer-
ret an janssen an when they disappeared
he disappeared
   wonder if he had a hand in butcherin
nancy smithers queried the deputy
  that was th ferrets work snapped
the sheriff  hes off his head when it
comes to usin a knife nobody but him
would a killed a harmless woman or
butchered her like that if he did kill her
no matter what i do with th other two if
i get em i know what ill do with th
ferret lemme get my-
   mesquite strained to hear the rest of it
but the words had become too faint he
caressed the handle of his gun the ferrets
evil face in his mind from what he had
heard of their careless talk about their cabin
rendezvous he had a pretty shrewd idea
of where it lay he waited until it was
safe to leave his hiding place and then rode
rapidly away eager to do the sheriffs -work
for him and to that extent ease his own
feelings
  for three days he rode hard covering
his trail by every trick he knew and despite
his youthfulness he knew plenty of them
experience would perfect them but they
would serve him in his present need he
made use of three creeks and several great
stretches of rocky ground and now he felt
secure from any pursuit there would be
nothing to fear for another day and then
he would need all his wits against a man
old in experience and filled with animal
cunning when cottonwood creek was
reached he would have to watch for the
ferret supposedly ahead of him
  the ferret was not ahead of him for
he was too cunning to lead the way to
the cabin and have a deadly enemy on his
trail the ferret did not believe that the
youngster was stupid enough to ride in the
direction of johnsville and had taken the
remark as having been made to throw him
off so he circled wide and killed time un-
til assured that mesquite was well on his
way the gunman not knowing the exact
or even approximate location of the cabin
would have to hunt for it and the ferret
would settle matters to his own satisfaction
when the little man swung in the direction
of his rendezvous with the swede intend-
ing to lay low there until the other arrived
he wasted no effort in trying to pick up the
gunmans trail knowing this to be useless
for a while he knew where the trail would
lead
  the ferret pushed on at a steady lope
which he would hold until he came to the
upper reaches of cottonwood creek from
there on he would use the coyote cunning
which had made him famous or infamous
depending on the viewpoint
  cottonwood creek was still half a days
ride when mesquite accidentally came to a
tiny spring under a mass of bowlders the
hopalong cassidy returns

shrinking waters of which were sucked up
by the sand before they had gone a hun-
dred yards he was tired his horse was
tired and he knew the value of a rest
where horseflesh was concerned swinging
from the saddle he stripped it off picketed
the horse to graze on the scanty grass about
the wetted sand and prepared a fire of diy
wood whose tenuous column of smoke
would broadcast no warning to hostile eyes
a small frying pan and a coffee pot made
the total of his culinary equipment and
both soon were resting on the blaze
  the ferrets empty canteen warned him
to consider mileage and the warning was
given added weight by the condition of his
mount
  cottonwood creek lay a full days
ride to the southwest but half a days ride
more to the east was bowlder spring not
known to many it would take him to a
good noon camp and from it on to the creek
was but half a days travel
  there was no reason save instinctive cau-
tion that made the little man scout about
before he rode up to the spring but as on
many previous occasions the caution saved
him to his surprise he saw the gunman
sitting cross-legged before his cunning fire
calmly eating and drinking the ferrets
beady eyes glinted and a ghastly grin
played on his face here was luck here
was his quarry open to his attack un-
suspicious placidly eating here was food
water plunder here was revenge and the
assurance of future safety it was like a
draft of cold air to a fevered brow should
he return to his horse for his rifle or allow
himself the pleasure given by his favorite
weapon this he decided quickly
  the ferret slipped among the bowlders
working closer and closer to his victim with
the stealth and cunning of a predatory cat
foot by foot yard by yard he advanced
down wind of the grazing horse and secure
from its curiosity he fixed his eyes on a
ledge rising up the height of a man behind
a bulwark of bowlders the space between
the two forming a natural trench from
that spot he could throw hard and true
he fixed his gaze on the base of mes-
quites neck and in his minds eye he could
see the pulsing jugular under the skin but
he did not make the mistake of looking
too long and steadily he had known men
to be warned by a steady gaze
  with infinite patience he approached the
ledge all his interest on the fire gained it
and crouched behind the wall of rocks peer-
ing through an interstice at the unsuspecting
youngster not thirty feet away he set his
feet solidly the right foot a step to the rear
he tensed himself swinging the right side
and shoulder back his right arm going out
behind in his hand lay the heavy throw-
ing knife its point and double edge razor
keen
  mesquite leaned over to reach for the
coffee pot his head for a moment turned
away and in that moment the ferret
straightened out of his crouch and his up-
raised hand reached swiftly backward over
the rim of the ledge to poise for the briefest
instant but something streaked to meet it
from the hot sand above and the driving
fangs hung in the flesh so deeply had they
been driven even this shock did not stop
the motion already begun and the hand
flashed forward but flashed wildly without
aim or direction and from the throwers
throat came an exclamation of terror
  mesquite whirled and shot like a streak
of light dropped the smoking gun into its
holster and hurried toward the bowlders
and the ledge not for one moment doubting
the sureness of his aim he rolled the
body over with a contemptuous careless
foot and then ducked back with a strangled
curse the flashing head had barely missed
him he drew his gun and was about to
kill the snake when he checked himself
his mental picture of that open mouth did
not show the fangs and he looked down
at the outflung hand near his feet two
fangs their points embedded in the meta-
carpals gave himthe explanation
   much obliged wriggly he grunted
bowing to the coiled reptile whose whirring
rattles now whirred a lie and he turned
back to finish his meal chuckling with sat-
isfaction
iv
  hopalong standing on the bank of the
creek gasped and staggered vaguely con-
scious of a shot close by the dogged per-

argosy-allstory weekly
sistence and grim courage which had em-
blazoned his name high throughout the
southwest sent him reeling into the thicket
hardly knowing what he was doing first
he must get out of sight and then try for
his guns
  on the other side of the creek mesquite
held up a smoking six-gun cursing the
nervous horse that had made him shoot
high and the persistence of his pursuers
how had they figured he would pass this
way had they captured janssen and
made him talk had they learned about
the cabin and figured he would head for
it he had no doubt that the man he had
just shot was sheriff dutton the mans
face was not the only thing for his limp
and the horse grazing near the creek would
admit of no doubt mesquite cursed this
unexpected danger so close to him when
he had believed himself secure from any
pursuit and he whirled his tired horse and
spurred away desperately anxious to get
a start on the deputies
  ordinarily red conners would have paid
slight attention to a shot but to his mind
came what he had heard from the nester
ten minutes after the report had died
away red pushed through the brush and
entered the camp
   here red answered hopalong drag-
ging himself from the thicket  creased
me shot without warnin cold an de-
liberate never mind me get that -
- i tell you im all right get him
   told you lookin like a sheriff was
sometimes dangerous growled red pick-
ing up his friend and carrying him to a
little sandy niche in the bank from where
he would have to watch only in one direc-
tion he hastened back to him with cloth-
ing and weapons canteen and food cursed
him affectionately then made a running
jump into his saddle
  the tracks were plain and told of speed
and a direct flight but to reds eyes they
also told of a weary horse he leaned for-
ward slightly and spoke to his mount and
thereupon the wind whistled past his ears
after an hours riding he sighted the fugi-
tive climbing a rise the other looked
back and strove to increase the speed of
his horse which was not wise after the long
hard journey it had made from the cactus-
johnsville trail
  mesquites backward glance showed him
that he was being hotly pursued by one
man then a bullet screamed past his ear
and another tore the sombrero from his
head again he glanced back and saw the
rifleman racing on again he was all of a
thousand yards distant but he had shot as
if it were a quarter of that range mesquite
told himself it was lucky shooting no
man could come so close twice in succes-
sion against a running target at a thou-
sand yards except by luck and then he
cursed as a red-hot welt sprang across the
top of his shoulder and he felt the hot blood
trickling down his back and chest he in-
stantly reversed himself about that ques-
tion of luck and looked eagerly ahead of
him at a thicket which rose up among and
around masses of tumbled rocks and bowl-
ders and he exulted as he neared it it
were suicide to flee on a slowing horse from
a man who shot as if he were the devil
straight from hell but once in that cover
he would show the deputy what shooting
was
  his mount wavered and swift spurs cov-
ered its heaving sides with blood and at
the edge of the thicket mesquite leaped
from the saddle and landed behind a line
of bowlders as a lead splotch appeared on
the rock and a wailing scream died out in
the sky he didnt give a second thought
to the canteen and the food on his horse
he could get them after dark when he
would be on his way again and once more
free from pursuing enemies playing i-
spy among the rocks was one of the best
things he did
  he crept swiftly among the bowlders to
get away from this place and to hole up
within sight of it there to wait and let the
other do the hunting or until night fell
and gave him a chance to steal the others
comparatively fresh horse and get away
he wiggled and crept farther and farther
back moving higher and higher up the gen-
tle slope at last he came to a nest of
rocks which overlooked the whole edge of
the cover and once among them he would
be content to watch and wait he peered
out between two bowlders and caught sight
hopalong cassidy returns

of the grazing horse picketed well to the
west there was no sign of its owner but
sooner or later he would move about and
if he moved about in due course he would
show himself for a moment
  mesquite was pushing himself back feet
first among the rocks of the nest when he
caught sight of a shadow moving on a bowl-
der between him and the edge of the cover
and he shifted his rifle a few inches peer-
ing along the sights the shadow grew
and took on the shape of a mans head and
sombrero and the fugitive chuckled as he
estimated the range which was point blank
and he tightened his finger on the trigger
then the shadow flowed back again and
he grunted in disappointment the deputy
was choosing the far side of the bowlder
for his advance that meant he would
come into sight from behind it on the right
and mesquite intended to be ready for him
  he sneered as a sombrero arose from be-
hind the rock and he held his fire it
moved gently up and down inviting him
but it invited in vain only a tenderfoot
would bite on a bait like that the posi-
tion in which he lay was cramping for a
shot to the right and he pushed back far-
ther into the opening among the rocks so
his head and shoulders would clear the rock
he lay behind and let him twist to its other
side for a better shot the fool still moved
his sombrero up and down as if any one
with sense would let drive at a thing like
that and give away his position
  shifting quickly mesquites legs pushed
against a piled up mass of debris stacked
there against the rocks by some high wind
and with the pressure of his knees there
came something which made him jump
convulsively the impact of a weighty body
and two sharp stinging punctures in his
leg across his mind flashed the picture
of the end of the ferret and then to his
nostrils came a sudden rank gust of the
copperhead odor the jump had carried
him a little wide of the protecting rock and
he no sooner had touched the ground again
than he rolled part way over and lay limp
  the sharp rifle crack from the right was
followed by a cloud of gray-white smoke
drifting gently with the wind and red
connors slowly arose pumping another
cartridge into the chamber of his weapon
although he knew he would have no imme-
diate use for it he was hatless and the
hot sun on his thin hair was not agreeable
he watched the victim of his shot and then
decided to have a quick look at him for the
sake of formality and climbed up the slope
  red sniffed suspiciously before the rock
pile and searched for signs of snakes fie
found none and his widening glance
showed him why a made-to-order snake
den contained no reptiles all around the
rock pile the ground was covered with lay-
ers of cactus leaves without a break ex-
cept where the fugitive had cleared a way
through them with the butt of his rifle
red stooped and examined some of the
stems but they had dried out and he could
not be sure of what he suspected if a
chaparral cock had placed diem there it
must have been a long time ago
  he went around the rock and glanced at
the figure huddled beside it but his gaze
immediately settled on a small partly dried
organ cactus which had fallen across one
of the legs he reached over and picked
it up eying it curiously it resisted his
first careless effort not because of its de-
ceptive weight alone but also because two
of its longest thickest spines had gone
through the fugitives trousers and skin
and deep into the flesh beneath them red
tossed it aside greatly puzzled and went
down the slope to get his sombrero off the
plant on which it bobbed up and down in
the wind a tempting bait for a rifleman
but more useful to show falsely a mans
position he mounted and rode back to-
ward the creek his suspicions gradually
becoming accepted
   huh imaginations a great thing
shore as shootin he reckoned he was struck
by a snake
  back at the rock pile mesquite opened
his eyes weak dazed and utterly confused
he lay motionless for a few moments then
rolled over again he shrank from the touch
of fangs and by a great effort raised his
head and looked down his leg what he
saw meant nothing to him for a moment
and then the meaning slowly dawned on
him a look of relief passed across his face
and he closed his eyes to rest a while be

brett the widow of old millionaire brett
being under thirty she had the advantage
of youth and in many ways she was an ex-
ceptionally attractive and accomplished
woman
  but i am and presumably always shall
be an extremely bashful man although a
member of a family to which social de-
portment is second nature i always suffered
acutely in the presence of any woman be-
tween fifteen and fifty the only way that
i could feel even slightly at ease was to
agree like a dunce with everything that
was said and those few words explain the
whole shameful affair
  catherine made up her mind to marry
me i think it was social position that she
was set upon
  brett had left her a great deal of money
but not enough to buy her way into the
circles which i merely because my great-
grandparents happened to have been  the
philadelphia fosters enjoyed through no
virtue of my own and having determined
to marry me catherine lost no time in set-
ting the snare
  now let me make it clear that i find
no fault with the lady i dont wish to
read this over when i am an old man and
be made bitter because of her memory
catherine was a firm believer in the theory
of propinquity she felt positive that once
we were married love would develop be-
tween us quite as a matter of course and
she counted upon that love to take care of
any differences of opinion and custom
which might arise
  for certainly there were some very vivid
differences she was a beautiful woman
slender graceful and tantalizingly languid
in her manner her face had a wistful
quality which made her sought for and
fought for by other men not so diffident
as i
  but i am a chunkily built fellow about
as graceful as a donkey engine and as
practical the only redeeming thing about
my face is an optimistic arrangement of
some rather large features in short i am
about the last man on earth whom any
woman in her right mind would seek for his
own sake
  but catherine misunderstood my idi-
otically agreeable attitude and thought i
had become smitten smitten i who
would rather jump into boiling oil than
to seek any woman whom it was possible
to dodge no man of my stamp could ever
fall in love with anything so terrorizing so
capable of causing so much utter misery as
a woman least of all so thoroughly femi-
nine a woman as catherine brett
  so without realizing that my weakness
was really an incurable curse catherine
went blithely ahead with her plans as for
what they were and just how they oper-
ated i cannot say at all i can merely
set down the bare fact that inside of a few
weeks i found myself more often in her
company than with all other women put
together and invariably i could not es-
cape
  it will always remain a mystery to me
i suppose catherine was a remarkable
woman that much is undeniable of
course to another woman it might seem
simple enough the way the game was
played but i am merely a practical scien-
tist and i must confess that to this day
i	retain a vast amount of respect for the
woman who could and did trap me in the
toils of cupid
  nevertheless i wish to be entirely fair
the fact is that i am by nature extremely
unwilling to hurt anybodys feelings i am
altogether too infernally sensitive about
such things
  had i deliberately offended catherine in
the first place instead of appearing to agree
with her this awful mess wouldnt have
come to pass but i couldnt
  so she must have concluded that i was
unwilling to propose because i didnt have
as much money as she accordingly she
induced old david sulzman to engage my
services
  now sulzman was not far from being a
billionaire and an unusually proud and
thoughtful man he was anxious to have
his name perpetuated in a way which would
stand against all time and forever remind
the people of the earth that it was once
the home of a really great tanner and
he decided that i largely on catherines
recommendation should undertake to erect
this monument

  i made good i conceived the idea and
carried it through all without a hitch of
any kind in all probability this monument
was the most stupendous engineering feat
ever pulled off i can always get a lot of
satisfaction from that fact no matter how
lonely i may become even though i live to
be a hundred
  this is what i accomplished first i
formed the foster construction company
and by spending sulzmans money like
water i made preparations on a prodigious
scale i began by erecting a powerful ap-
paratus for projecting radioactive sub-
stances into space- the ray-projector
we called it and it was set up in south
america not far from quito
  then using a new sort of radioactivity
which i synthesized several years ago-min-
ing the material and refining it on the spot
-i developed an antigravitational force of
such terrific unheard-of strength that i was
able to dislodge the moon
  that is to say i directed enough of
 fosters rays  against one side of the
moon to produce a decided reduction in
her velocity where formerly she had a
speed in her yearly journey round the sun
somewhat greater than that of the earth-
enough to allow her to circle the planet
every month-her velocity was now so
much reduced that her month was increased
to three hundred and sixty-five days
  consequently since she no longer sailed
around the earth every twenty-nine days
she now remained always on that side of the
planet farthest from the sun and obvious-
ly the earth now has and always will have
full moon each and every night
  but that is not all i did this reduc-
tion in the speed of the moon broke up the
former gravitational balance between her
and the earth so that the distance between
them is now only one-tenth of what it
used to be in other words-since areas are
in proportion to the squares of diameters-
the moonlight on the earth is now a hundred
times as great as formerly and the net re-
sult is that the planet does not now need
artificial light and never will for all time
  david sulzmans money made all this
possible he is immortalized by the fact
that the world knows his money did it
    	a
and he came to me as i have said because
catherine brett induced him so to do
  well after the work was about half com-
pleted i came back home to find catherine
firmly convinced that we were engaged at
any rate she flung herself into my arms in
front of a house full of other women and
-what was i to do in a week or so i
found myself totally without knowing how
it had come about breathlessly begging for
her to set the day
  and so the world was informed that
catherine brett was soon to become the
bride of philip foster the man who moved
the moon think of it social position and
unbounded advertising all at one fell stroke
the womans triumph was complete
  but i faced a future as black and fear-
some as the night i had just succeeded in
vanquishing life looked like a wilderness
of toadstools
  why the mere proposition of getting
married to any woman was downright tor-
ture to me i could never stand the ordeal
itself and as for marrying catherine-
  i ran away i took advantage of a very
peculiar situation the moon was then
being maintained in her new location by
means of the projector down in ecuador
but it was necessary to make alterations
in the satellite itself in order that this loca-
tion might become self-supporting as it
were otherwise the moon would have
fallen to the earth
  an expedition was required briefly we
fitted up a number of powerful sky cars
simple affairs insulated against the etheric
conditions and forced them into space upon
streams of the rays each was equipped
with a small projector powerful enough to
check its fall to the moon also a supply of
material
  and when their crews reached the satel-
lite they proceeded to the farthermost side
-the side which has always been turned
away from the earth-and there they swift-
ly blasted away almost exactly half the
sphere enough to restore a gravitational
balance between planet and satellite
  i went along to boss things when the
job was done the moon was no longer a
sphere but a hemisphere with the curved
side still toward the earth the other side

is now an approximately flat surface a level
plain some twenty-one hundred miles in
diameter for the force of those rays was
enough to blow all those rocks into space
with such velocity that-since the moons
gravity is so slight-none of it ever re-
turned or ever will
  now on the last day of our operations
i secretly unpacked a duplicate of the in-
sulated aluminium-armored suit that i had
been wearing down to the oxygen-fed
helmet it was precisely the same this
duplicate i  planted  in a lifelike pose
in a spot which i knew to be next in line
for the projector
  and i arranged matters so that this suit
was observed just a moment before the rays
were turned upon the spot it was too late
to give warning and the duplicate suit was
blown into space along with part of the
moon while so far as most of my men
knew philip foster perished at the same
instant
  but five of my men know that down in
the rocks upon which one of the sky cars
had rested lay a large natural cavern
stocked with supplies of all kinds it was
in this cavern that i was secreted when my
other suit was destroyed and it was here
that out of sight of all beholders i con-
tinued to hide until finally all the crews left
the moon
  and it is over this cabin that i have
erected my little aluminium and glass ob-
servatory i intend to keep most of my
materials down there it will save space up
here and for the sake of keeping tab from
time to time suppose i make a list right
here of the equipment with which i am pro-
vided
  	one hemispherical glass house twen-
ty feet in diameter and ten feet high with
walls of double thickness it is proof
against both extreme cold and extreme heat
also against etheric electricity it is built
with a vestibule that is provided with two
doors an inner one and an outer one in
order to pass in or out all i have to do is
to wear my suit and take care to close the
one door before opening the other
  	a fully equipped though small scale
laboratory it contains everything from
test tubes and lathe to chemicals and tele-
scopes of the latter one is an eight inch
refractor of unusual excellence i am
equipped to dabble in chemistry physics
radioactivity and astronomy what more
could an engineer ask
  	some thirty steel cylinders triple in-
sulated each containing liquid oxygen
rather it was liquid en route but now
some of it is solid by means of simple
chemical apparatus i am able to purify
my little hoard of air of such carbon dioxide
as my breathing creates and replace it with
fresh oxygen i also have two cylinders of
ordinary liquid air
  	a wireless telegraph outfit at present
fitted only for receiving later i expect to
work out a transmitting system such as will
suit the rather peculiar conditions here
with what i have however i can learn the
worlds more important news as transmit-
ted daily by my partner bates he will
begin as soon as the sky cars have returned
no sooner because all of them are fitted
with outfits similar to mine and only five
of the men share my secret
  	two canaries-fannie and dickie i
would like to have had other creatures but
was obliged to consider the problem of sup-
plies especially oxygen neither bird has
felt like singing as yet
  	apparatus for collecting free electric-
ity from the surrounding ether more about
this later probably
  	far more food than i shall ever need
it is all hermetically sealed and protected
from frost and for the most part is pre-
cooked and condensed to the smallest pos-
sible space i have everything from raisins
to onions from whale steak to pigs feet
moreover i am planning a dietary system
which will give me a complete change of
fare each meal for forty-five days at a
stretch so i do not expect ever to tire of
my food
  	a library as complete as money could
make it i have all that a man of my
training could desire of encyclopedias
alone there are no less than six but while
most of the volumes are technical there are
also several philosophical works together
with a little fiction-of an adventurous
rather than a romantic description
  	the armored insulated suit already
out of the moon

referred to this makes it possible for me
to do any amount of exploring and it is so
well made that it will far outlast its wearer
  	a miscellaneous collection of articles
for light housekeeping from teaspoons to a
folding cot i have a neat little electrical
range upon which i can heat such eatables
as i may prefer hot i also have a certain
amount of plumbing all very sanitary and
convenient
  	a large amount of liquified hydro-
gen by combining this with oxygen in
the manner usually employed to secure
water synthetically in laboratories i shall
be able to deal generously with the thirst
problem i intend to install some frost-
proof piping and manufacture the water
down in the cavern so as to save space up
here
  	an unclassified assortment of articles
such as hardly deserve special mention here
although i may have occasion to mention
them all in time one is the finest medicine
chest i could find together with instruc-
tions i expect to have no need whatever
for anything except for certain astringent
drugs on occasions when i must be in my
suit for long periods
  	last but perhaps the most impor-
tant of all i possess two fine talking ma-
chines one is of the cylinder type for
recording only i intend to  can  a few
sentences of my own nearly every day for
reference in the future the other machine
uses disk records of which i own some four
thousand all different they include mu-
sic recitations and many other numbers
enough to keep me interested for the balance
of my life my scheme is to use one
hundred until i begin to tire of them then
start another hundred by the time the
fortieth hundred has been finished the first
should seem quite new their main value
will be to keep me from talking to myself
a habit which would surely lead to the loss
of my reason i shall take the utmost care
with every disk
  one thing only that i need to regret
this equipment cost a vast amount of money
-far more than ought to be spent on any
one individual but sulzman unquestion-
ingly paid every bill moreover i have no
doubt that the people of the earth as they
enjoy their permanent full moon to-night
would never object to the expense if they
knew all the facts
  i think i will stop now and prepare a
little supper then i shall play a dozen or
so of my records and turn in for my cus-
tomary eight hours of sleep
  i do not expect to dream any but pleas-
ant dreams i am perfectly satisfied with
life i could not ask to have things dif-
ferent i am serene in the knowledge that
i have done something decidedly worth
while for humanity
  i have no compunctions about running
away from catherine for i have given her
what she sought-prominence she occu-
pies the enviable position of fiancee to a
martyr what does it matter if the martyr
remains alive so long as people think him
dead
  to-morrow i begin exploring

never done before
november -i was about to begin
this entry with  arose this morning
after a good nights rest  but i
remembered in time that such would be
far from accurate not on this satellite
the conditions here are too radically dif-
ferent from what they are on the earth
in fact if i merely state that there was
really no such thing as night here i should
be giving only a fragment of the whole
peculiar situation
  perhaps i ought to describe the condition
of affairs just in case there should ever
come a time when i might need reassuring
to begin with i am located on the western
 edge  of the moon at a point not far
from what would be called the equator by
any one studying a lunar map on such a
map the nearest conspicuous object is the
crater  langrenus about a hundred and
fifty miles southeast of me northeast twice
that distance is the edge of the great sea-
bottom known as  mare crisium so
much for topography as seen from the
earth
  now because of my position on the edge
of this little world my observatory house

argosy-allstory weekly
never receives the vertical rays of the sun
old sol is always just at the horizon some-
times due to a certain hbration in the path
of the moon he is just above the surface
and at other times only partially in sight
never will he totally disappear and never
will he rise even one hour high
  i chase this spot with that item in mind
knowing that if i took up my residence di-
rectly opposite the earth right under the
sun i should find the brilliance intolerable
while if i picked a spot which might ever
be in total darkness i should have some
pretty trying times dependent entirely upon
artificial light as it is i live in continual
twilight or rather dawn
  that is the situation the new position
of the moon not only keeps the same face
always earthward the same as earth has
always seen but it now keeps this face
always sunward as well there will never
be an eclipse because the original oper-
ations of the ray-projector in ecuador
were so calculated as to throw the moon
forever slightly out of line with the earths
shadow the sunlight here is constant
  east north and south of me stretches
the great hemisphere of crater-strewn coun-
try such as the telescopes o the earth know
so well-the territory which it shall be my
business to explore very thoroughly west
of me not two hundred yards away the
surface of the moon comes to an abrupt end
a steep precipice is all that remains of the
other side of the satellite
  it is just as though some giant of the
universe had sliced off half the satellite and
cast it away the precipice is merely one
vast circular plain twenty-one hundred and
odd miles in diameter
  hold on i wrote the same thing yester-
day by jove i shall have to watch my-
self it is a bad sign when a man gets to
repeating himself it shall not occur again
  the ground upon which my house is
erected is not ground at all but the solidest
kind of rock i would call it silicate for
want of a more exact term the stuff is
bluish black exceedingly hard and smooth
and not to be accounted for by the action
of either fire or water or a combination of
the two it isnt lava and it isnt basalt
it is more like hard rubber only heavier
  my house is located upon a sea of such
rocks some of them are great fragments
-not bowlders for bowlders would show
some indications of weathering-but im-
mense jagged chunks slabs and splinters
alike only in that their edges are as sharp
and clean cut as if fresh from some convicts
rock pile
  of course there is no air here on the
moon except for just what i have here in
my house neither is there any other water
i find that i must continually remind my-
self of these two facts in order to under-
stand what i see
  my landscape is a black and white one
there is no such thing as color either an
object is brilliantly lighted by the sun or
else it is totally invisible blackness or daz-
zling light there is nothing in between
all this of course is due to the lack of air
which prevents refractions and diffusion of
light
  the only thing at all like it that i ever
saw on the earth was some of the early
moving pictures they were painfully devoid
of any softening shadows just like the
 scenery  around here i might also
mention that because of the position of the
sun near the horizon all the shadows are
long ones it is as though the sun were
always rising or always setting-somewhere
in the highest part of the rockies
  when i look about the horizon however
i see something more than black rocks
white lights and long black shadows for
one thing i see the sun that is if i put
on some heavily smoked glasses otherwise
his terrific brilliance unhooded by any in-
tervening atmosphere as on the earth would
blind me in two seconds
  in size he is just about the same but
since there is no air he looks neither bigger
nor yellower because of his position on the
horizon on the earth he would
  i also see mother earth she would be
a wonderful object if only i could see her
with the sunlight on her face but of course
this will always be impossible the moon
lies  outside  the earth with respect to
the sun and i shall have to be content
with her moonlit surface
  however she is something to be mighty
grateful for just as she stands i can watch
out of the moon

her daily revolution as no man ever watched
it before every twenty-four hours with
the utmost regularity north america will
swing into view and as long as i live to use
my telescope i can always focus upon cali-
fornia at midnight and look down on san
francisco to fancy that i see my friends
getting into their airplanes after finishing
their after-theater suppers
   in fact the earth is the only bit of color
in my landscape as viewed from here she
is a dull copper color except where the
sunlight touches there she is a dazzling
golden tint near the poles she is white
with snow and ice and it is always easy
even with the naked eye to distinguish the
green blue of the oceans as they swing
majestically into opposition
   in size of course the planet is immense-
nearly twenty degrees an eighteenth of the
whole sky circle from pole to pole but
obviously i never see more than half of her
disk at any one time because of my posi-
tion at the edge of the moon if i want
to see the whole disk at one view i shall
have to travel to a more central spot
  no air no water black rocks that are
blistering hot where the sun shines upon
them and freezing cold a few inches away
in the shadow a blinding sun a gigantic
mother earth in a ruddy semi darkness a
continual unending day-no such thing as
night
  no man friday to share my exile noth-
ing but my wireless shall i lose all sense
of time
  not if i take a little care my chronom-
eters are adjusted to keep the same time
they always kept back on the earth every
twenty-four hours as ticked off by their
balance wheels i shall designate as one full
day
  by the way i have an ordinary pendu-
lum clock in operation which offers a curi-
ous comparison the reduced gravity of the
moon results in a  second  about six times
as long as that of the earth or my chro-
nometers according to that clock i have
been on the moon only seven hours and
fifteen minutes instead of about forty-four
hours of course a year is a year here
the same as back home i shall not become
confused i dare not
  yes i might as well have begun this
with  arose this morning im going to
stick to the old day the old way all i
need to do to keep up the semblance of
conditions on the earth is to draw the
shades on the sunlit side of the house as i
did last-well let it go at that-last night
  so after a very hearty breakfast at
about the hour i always used to eat break-
fast i got out my suit and gave it an extra
careful inspection next i removed the
weighted shoes which i and all my men
had worn for the purpose of offsetting the
difference in gravitation between the planet
and the satellite we wore them so as to
make our movements more natural but
now i am a resident-in fact the only
resident so far as it is humanly possible to
know-the only resident of the moon and
i mean to acclimatize myself at once
  for the first time then since i was left
alone on the satellite i ventured outside
my double doored vestibule i moved with
the utmost care placing my feet slowly and
carefully i felt amazingly light and free
and for a while suspected that i was allow-
ing too much oxygen to feed into my hel-
met but after inspecting the gauges i
concluded that the feeling was due entirely
to my reduced weight
  i weighed only thirty pounds instead
of a hundred and eighty such was the net
effect of the moons reduced gravitation
at the same time nothing whatever had oc-
curred to reduce my muscular strength in
the least my heavy armor and helmet
added only six moon pounds to my weight
i was a veritable giant
  i felt no ill effects whatever of course
before leaving the vestibule i had not only
made sure that there were no leaks of any
kind in my suit but had pumped in a little
more air just in case a leak should develop
      twenty-four hours- of course it is true that the  recoil  of the ray-projector in
equador while reducing the speed of the moon naturally produced a complementary increase in
the speed of the earths daily revolution so that the day is actually only twenty-two hours long
old time but to avoid confusion the standard second was revised thus keeping the old and
well understood svstem it will be noted that mr foster was aware of all this

  the purpose of this obviously was to
maintain the same pressure upon the out-
side of my body as it has always been ac-
customed to otherwise the effect would
have been much the same as bringing the
diver too rapidly to the surface blood ves-
sels would burst and death ensue
  the people of the earth seldom stop to
think that their bodies are at all times sub-
ject to a pressure of fourteen pounds to
each square inch and if this pressure were
suddenly removed the effect would be actu-
ally explosive the pressure works both
ways from the inside out as well as from
the outside in
  when i say that i felt no ill effects i
mean that i experienced no vertigo dizzi-
ness or weakness on the other hand i
was distinctly elated vigorous and clear
headed i had just enough sense left to
go slowly and take things coolly
  i stepped out of the vestibule and closed
the outer door behind me had it not been
for the peculiar insulated construction of
my suit i should have died in my tracks
right then and there for i was exposed to
three extremely powerful influences either
of them enough to annihilate me instantly
had i not been protected against them
three forces such as no one on the earth
could appreciate to the full let me name
them
  cold i was facing the sun but my back
was in the shadow and the temperature
of things in the shade on the moon is
about three hundred below zero it is
very close to what scientists call  the ab-
solute zero  unthinkably cold capable of
congealing the blood of a human in less
time than i could record the event on this
typewriter
  heat the side of me that faced the sun
on the other hand was receiving untem-
pered sunbeams no air intervened to soft-
en the impact of the suns energy my
thermometer had already told me that the
temperature of any material capable of ab-
sorbing heat such as mercury or the human
body would rise to past two hundred and
fifty degrees without my suit i should
have been cooked to a crisp on one side and
frozen solid on the other all because there
is no air
  electricity here i touch upon a sub-
ject that is not generally understood but
it is rapidly becoming known among scien-
tists that the hundred miles or so of at-
mosphere which surrounds the earth is
really a great insulating blanket were it
not for this air no one could live upon
the planet without continual protection
  this for the simple reason that lightning
so well known but so poorly understood
is nothing more or less than universal en-
ergy-the luminiferous ether in action-
which occasionally manages to break down
the insulation and touch the earth as for
myself on the moon i was literally bathed
in current without my suit i should have
been instantly electrocuted
  looking through the double glazed
vacuum insulated windows of my non-
conducting helmet i was virtually uncon-
scious of all this i could move about in
perfect safety and with entire freedom so
long as i took reasonable care and kept
a close watch upon my pressure gauge my
oxygen and my carbonic acid absorber
i gave a final glance into my domelike
house to make sure that i had left every-
thing in order-especially the canaries-
and then ventured cautiously perhaps ten
yards away
  my new home looked pitifully small it
came to me with sudden tremendous force
that for the last two days only those
thick glass walls had stood between me
and instant death i was immensely glad
that nothing so far as i could see would
ever happen to that structure if i thought
an accident at all possible i should wear
my suit continually indoors as well as out-
side
  a little further away from the house
and i came to an open spot where the
surface was comparatively level that is
to say the rock fragments were small and
evenly spread out for a space perhaps fifty
feet either way it looked like a good place
to begin experiments
  fixing my eye upon a flat stone about
thirteen or fourteen feet away-too far for
me to jump on the earth-i drew a deep
breath discarded every one of my former
cautious methods and just as if i were
back in california i took a single bold
out of the moon

step forward that one step took me to
the stone
  so much for having a weight of only
thirty-six pounds armor and all shortly
i was striding about rather freely cover-
ing always about thirteen feet at a step
as compared with thirty-two inches on the
earth not only were my movements un-
hampered by gravity but i did not have
to overcome any air resistance much less
a wind
  it was like moving in a dream except
that i could distinctly feel the usual jar
and shock of walking on my heels how-
ever this jar was insignificant compared
with what i had been used to instead of
ninety pounds falling on each foot now-
only eighteen
  soon i felt safe in ordinary walking
i went to one side of the space i was
using and faced the other then i gath-
ered my strength as for a standing broad
jump determined upon a spot about ten
yards away-and leaped
chapter iii
exploring the moon
away i went sailing through space
it reminded me of one of those trick
motion pictures- slowed up -in
which people go through various antics at
an unnaturally slow pace i thought i
should never get back to the surface i
must have gone all of twenty feet high
but in two or three seconds i saw my tar-
get deliberately approaching me and knew
long before i landed that i had overshot
my mark
  down i came six feet beyond the point
i had aimed for landing clumsily and
stumbling so that i groveled on my hands
and knees but i was merely a little shak-
en the armor saved me
  up i got and tried again presently i
became so confident that i began to make
use of the time that i was sailing as soon
as i leaped i looked about for a few sec-
onds and from the height thus attained was
able to inspect a large stretch of country
  southeast of me where i knew the crater
langrenus to be located i could make out
a number of mountains all of them in the
crater form no peak but simply an ele-
vated cup but none had a tenth the size
that i knew langrenus to possess how-
ever it was extremely hard to be sure of
this the peculiar black and white of the
landscape was very deceptive
  if there had been a little air to temper
the shadows in the background so as to give
some effect of perspective sizes and dis-
tances would have been more easily guessed
at but far or near it was simply black
and white
  northeast of me were more of these
craterlets and beyond them i knew was
the great sea bottom mare crisium i
was already quite familiar with craters
from my experiences on the other side of
the moon during the blasting but this an-
cient ocean bed appealed to me strongly
my curiosity will not let me rest until i
have seen crisium
  but the distance is about three hundred
miles assuming that i can travel six times
as fast as on the earth it will take me a
day and a half to reach the spot the same
length of time to return and at least two
days for exploration this means a lot of
supplies more than i can possibly carry
must i give up the idea
  not at all this is a difficulty which i
foresaw long ago and while i never took
time to work it out i nevertheless brought
along enough raw materials of various kinds
to enable me to solve the problem i shall
enjoy the work
  required to construct something hither-
to unknown a machine for traveling on the
surface of the moon given some pieces of
metal and wood some books and one sec-
ond rate brain
  november  i failed to finish my ac-
count of yesterdays experiences for the
very good and sufficient reason that i be-
came so tired and sleepy that i had to go to
bed no wonder i have seldom exercised
as much as i did during my first attempts
to do as the romans do unfortunately
there are no romans here besides the cor-
rect name for an inhabitant of the moon i
believe is  selenite and as for my ap-
petite-im afraid the larder will not per-
mit of a great deal of such exercise

argosy-allstory weekly
  this morning i arose without so much
as giving a second glance at the sun which
had been in exactly the same place all
 night  long in fact i completely forgot
that there had been no such thing as night
that there was no such thing as morning
i am getting to be quite a man of the
moon
  outside of that i accomplished little
all i did was to go outside and limber up a
little keeping always within sight of the
house on my way back i took a flying
leap and sailed entirely over it thus set-
ting a new record leaped over a house
who on earth could do that
  then after luncheon i got out a number
of my books and brushed up on the sub-
jects which i need to know if i am to suc-
ceed in building my moon car i reached
no conclusions apparently the problem is
decidedly more difficult than i had antici-
pated
  after dinner about three hours ago i
found myself becoming very blue and
gloomy awakening to the fact i wound
up my talking machine and it required
only ten records judiciously selected so as
to amuse and cheer me to take out all the
kinks in my disposition i am in an en-
viable frame of mind i wouldnt trade
places with any man in existence even
though he never knew what it is to be
bashful
  november  thanksgiving day the
boys in the sky cars will spend a gloomy
holiday-all except the five who know-for
they cannot help but look forward to break-
ing the news poor devils i wish i had
thought of that too late now though
  fortunately no one on the earth will be
so affected those who are not in the
secret yet have any reason to concern them-
selves with my return probably are mak-
ing some sort of preparations i under-
stood that there was to be a big reception
or something of that sort another affair
which i shall escape and for which i am
duly thankful
  i sat down at my drawing table and tried
for an hour to puzzle out a design for my
moon car no ideas would come i saw
that i wasnt in a mood for inventing so i
decided to make a short excursion and put-
ting ten hours supply of oxygen into the
tank on the back of my suit also placing
certain other materials inside the helmet i
began my first real exploration
  right now as i write my glance rests
upon the astounding fruits of that trip the
incredible thing lies there a foot away last
night nothing of the sort was inside this
house i wonder if i would have been so
eager to start out this morning had i known
what i was going to bring back
  well my objective was a small crater
about fifty miles directly east of me i
had often seen it while leaping i chose
that direction because i could not possibly
become confused all i had to remember
was that although i started out with my
face toward the sun i should return with
my shadow straight before me
  at first i contented myself with a fairly
rapid stride i covered ground at an im-
mense rate eighteen miles an hour walk-
ing isnt bad at all but i soon became
tired of having to pick a footing so often
among those annoyingly sharp rock frag-
ments besides the sensation of annihilat-
ing distance so rapidly soon amounted to
a kind of intoxication shortly i found my-
self running and leaping like some clumsy
mountain sheep from one crag to the next
  it was amazing the ease with which i
adapted myself to the new order of things
i picked out the most precarious landing
places and hit them almost without fail
and when i did miss which was seldom
nothing much came of it i merely tum-
bled eight or ten feet and hardly noticed
it at all
  as i say i didnt have to worry about
directions there was no such thing as
 time of day  whenever i glanced at the
sun i did not have to make allowances i
didnt have to worry about getting back
before nightfall there wasnt going to be
any nightfall i merely had to watch my
step
  once i came near to ending everything
it was after perhaps an hour of the swift-
est sort of leg work i had covered over
twenty miles the area of rock fragments
was now behind me i had reached a very
different sort of territory with a surface
of gray glassy material flecked with sands
out of the moon

  it was quite capable of deceiving most
people into calling it lava because of its
heat twisted configurations- and since the
stuff is really the remains of what was once
molten rock lava is perhaps as good a term
as any for i have never seen a schist on
earth with such a color
  i had no idea that anything was in store
for me of course the surface was ex-
tremely rough but no longer full of sharp
edges and jagged points instead the schist
was mounded rolled and twisted in every
conceivable way one moment a great ter-
race thirty feet high would compel me
to make a strenuous leap and next i would
be facing a maze of contorted dikes over
which i would hurtle without a glance
  i was making wonderful progress i for-
got to stop and rest and it was just when
i had become thoroughly tired and winded
that i came to the crevice
  it was over a hundred yards wide i did
not see it until i was right on its brink
in fact i had already landed only a few
steps from the edge my leg all tense for
springing on before i realized that the next
leap would take me into the depths of the
moon
  how i did it i do not know but some-
how i contrived to make my foot slip even
in the act of bounding the slip saved my
life instead of flying up into space again
i fell forward upon my face and slid help-
lessly toward the chasm when i finally
stopped my head and shoulders were ac-
tually over the edge
  i looked down the sun wasnt shining
directly into the cleft and i couldnt see
very plainly however there was no dust or
air to interfere with what i did see and
although i cannot say just how deep that
awful crack may be at least i can submit
that the bottom lies more than five miles
down
  in order to find a place where the crack
was narrow enough to leap i had to detour
about two miles however this took only
a few minutes i discovered a place where
any amateur could have made the jump
with ease it wasnt over forty feet
  but the experience served to make me
more cautious i forced myself to rest every
so often during one of these rests i
thought to look at the time-my watch
being hung on the inside of my helmet
safe from the elements-and saw that it was
after eleven
  time to eat something so twisting my
head in another direction i connected my
mouth with the upper end of a rubber
tube leading to a flask of milk at the back
of my suit i also had some toast and dried
meat placed within tooth range and i fin-
ished it all off with a mouthful of black
coffee all this arrangement of course
because i dared not open my helmet except
indoors i missed my napkin and will ar-
range for one next time
  the craterlet was now just before me
not more than five miles away up i got
decidedly refreshed and before long i was
making my way at a lively rate up the
flanks of the  volcano my path took me
first into a steep  lava  swept ravine
then by easy stages on up to a ridge and
thence steadily upward
  the surface was mainly fantastic schist
and gneiss formations except at the very
crest of the ridge where black rock-basalt
itself-occasionally showed for a foot or
two however i picked out specimens of
nearly every known metamorphic rock all
fused and usually glassy mainly i was
concerned with the labor of climbing of
course i did not approach from the shad-
owed side for that would have meant work-
ing in total darkness i ascended the north-
ern flank i am making a special note of
this because for all i know it may have an
important bearing upon the discovery i
made and am about to relate
  after two or three tumbles one of which
bruised me even through the armor i
reached the top of the  crater it stood
perhaps four thousand feet high-a puny
affair as lunar mountains go the point
where i viewed the pit was really a moun-
tain pass the lip of the crater being com-
posed of small jagged peaks arranged
roughly in the form of a circle
  on the outer side these crags sloped
away evenly to the plain below on the
inner side they dropped away abruptly in
an almost perpendicular precipice many
thousands of feet high and ending in the
floor of the  volcano shrouded in total

argosy-allstory weekly
blackness the nearly horizontal rays of
the sun allowed only such glimpses as i
was able to get by means of rifts in the
crags but i was not disappointed in this
because i had known what to expect i also
knew that no man would ever explore that
bottom unless he used artificial light
  i fell to thinking of the theory favored
by such scientists as do not consider these
pits to be true volcanoes that they were
caused by the impact of great meteors upon
the surface of the moon while it was still
in a molten condition the appearance is
certainly very similar to the effect of peb-
bles thrown into stiff mud and there is an-
other theory which claims that while the
larger craters were actually volcanic the
smaller ones were produced by the fall-
ing of material previously ejected from the
others
  but i know better and the scientific men
of the earth now know better they know
that all these craters were produced in the
same way and that they were formed after
the satellite had hardened not before and
that they were due not to meteors nor to
internal heat but to lightning
  electricity did it when the moon lost
her atmosphere the insulation broke down
and every time the etheric current managed
to break through in large quantities a crater
was formed prodigious quantities of un-
leashed electricity of which ordinary light-
ning is only a tiny sample-it was this that
striking the surface of the satellite pro-
duced those terrific pits
  and of course the largest discharges
came last when the insulation was nearly
gone which explains why some of the
larger pits overlap the smaller the heat
must have been like that of the sun small
wonder that the rocks are fused like those
from volcanoes
  it must have been a sight for the gods
when that final stroke of superlightning
created the giant pit which men call tycho
and what another sight a few millions of
years hence when the earth shall have lost
her air and water and her surface be re-
duced to pockmarks that is unless
an enlightened and harmonious humanity
does something to conserve that atmosphere
beforehand
  it was a sobering thought i stood there
alone in that fire blasted wilderness and
marveled as i had marveled time and time
again during the last few weeks at the im-
measurable power of unchecked nature
  i was surrounded by the torn and slashed
up fragments of what had once been sand-
stone-sandstone a formation due to the
action of water and in two or three places
i could even discern fragments of meta-
morphosed shale and shale is merely mud
with all that the word suggests
  this had once been a world like that i
have quit for good at least geologically
speaking what did i a mere human and
transplanted one at that amount to along-
side such a cataclysm
  well i had fifty miles to travel before
dinner time and i didnt propose to post-
pone eating just because the sun wyould
never go down i turned to go
  something unusual caught my eye it
was lying in a small cavity on the western
slope of a huge rock fragment the stone
was fused and the thing i saw was half
buried in half protruding from a pool of
brownish glass i went over and exam-
ined it
  and if i had found a newspaper instead
i could not have been more amazed for
there in the wildest spot in creation fifty
miles from any point where men from the
earth had already trod was something that
argued human occupancy what was more
it was as i have said half buried in what
had once been molten material so i knew
that it had existed before the crater was
formed
  and it lies at my hand as i write it is
a piece perhaps eight or nine inches long
altogether of ordinary half inch round
electric light carbon
chapter iv
the disappearance
november -i did not attempt to
finish my diary last night i was too
much upset by what i had found it
took over forty records to make me forget
enough to permit sleep even then i
dreamed all sorts of outrageous things some
out of the moon

terrifying some merely ludicrous all be-
cause of a piece of common carbon pre-
sumably millions of years old
  what does it mean does it indicate
that there has once been civilization on the
moon the idea is not at all untenable
if we assume that earth and moon were
both formed from the some mass of cosmic
material then life could just as easily have
come into being here as on the earth and
since the moon is smallest it would have
cooled off sooner thus permitting life at an
earlier day millions of years ago
  but what has become of the inhabitants
have they lived and died leaving no traces
other than this electricity proof carbon
long before the earth became cool enough
to support life or were they still alive
when the great discharges of universal elec-
tricity began their terrible rain if so they
could not have lived through it
  surely they foresaw the loss of air why
had they apparently done nothing to fore-
stall this disaster for example a glass
roof over the whole of their globe but
there were no signs of this was it likely
that they had become as far advanced as
us humans
  something else occurred to me had
these people become so highly developed
along scientific lines-that piece of carbon
is unanswerable-they produced some sort
of sky cars and before the lightning broke
through managed to migrate to the earth
  i did not go to sleep until after mid-
night for the first time i devoutly wished
that i might enjoy real darkness once more
i have always valued my sleep very highly
  well this morning i resolved to forget
my find for the day further speculation
would not help matters besides i was
keenly aware that my friends had reached
the earth some time during the night if
nothing had occurred to delay them i
might hear from bates at any moment
  so i sat down at the drawing table and
tried to work on my car design it was
hopeless every few minutes i would get up
and walk around my little circle as nervous
and excited as a boy waiting for a circus
parade i tried to read i might as well
have tried to embroider
  in desperation i finally started the talk-
ing machine purposely selecting something
very involved and intricate in classical mu-
sic-bach i think in trying to under-
stand it i presently got over my nervous-
ness
  at ten twenty-four to be exact the first
message arrived from the earth i am glad
that there was no one to see me as i ex-
citedly fitted the headpiece to my ears my
eagerness was positively childish
  and then what did jack see fit to trans-
mit-in code of course-but a message like
this
     hello man in the moon
    you ought to be here people think more
  of you dead than alive all sorts of puff
  stuff youre a martyr to science-you hum-
  bug
     catherine brett is prostrated by the news
   vows she will never marry any one else
    more later dont dare send too much
  amateurs might get the code hurry up with
  your transmitter
                                      jack
  november  it occurred to me this
morning that i did overlook one thing after
all despite the thoroughness with which i
made my preparations i forgot to arrange
with jack to call me only at agreed upon
hours
  it means that i shall have to remain here
at all times must never leave the house for
more than a few minutes lest i miss some-
thing either that or i must contrive to
build that transmitter and let jack know
or-and this has just occurred to me-i
can make some sort of an automatic record-
er to take care of any message at any
time
  why didnt i think of that before
easily made im going straight to do it
now
  i ought to mention however that it has
been a pleasant day no rain no snow no
winds not a cloud in the sky temperature
at sixty-eight every minute how soon will
i be praying for a change i wonder
  november  a gloomy day if ever a
day of continual sunlight could be called
gloomy
  in the first place i wasted a lot of mighty
valuable material in trying to solve my
automatic recorder problem along the wrong
lines i shall try again of course working

argosy-allstory weekly
on another principle but it makes me im-
patient with myself to have used my head
so inefficiently
 perhaps it was because of fannie i
found her dead in her cage this morning
i am not sure but i really think that i
know what time she died it was about
three in the morning and i awoke with a
vague feeling that something was wrong
i dismissed the thought as due to a dream
i know better now
  i may as well admit that i could not eat
breakfast until i had not only disposed of
her body but had also taken her cage out-
doors i hid it behind some rocks i
couldnt bear to leave it where i might see it
  as if this were not enough jacks mes-
sage was equally lacking in cheer i must
hurry and get that transmitter done and
tell the old boy to take care with what he
sends me here is what he judged fit for
me twenty-four thousand miles from the
nearest fellow human to read and digest
    you are missing something great at in-
  stigation of san francisco officials the united
  states is going to give you an official funeral
  is to be a gorgeous ceremony to take place
  three days hence notables already en plane
  from all parts of the globe
    catherine brett is said to have started the
  movement your relatives make no state-
  ment  apparently do not wish to make them-
  selves conspicuous by objecting
    nothing has taken the public fancy so much
  since the revival you really ought to have
  died long ago
  i wonder if the old fellow is deliberately
rubbing it in someone told me just before
i left with the crews that jack was really
jealous because i got so much applause out
of the moon moving stunt can it be
 pshaw i ought to be ashamed of my-
self distrusting my old partner what
the deuce has got into me i never used
to be like this
  well talking about it wont make it any
better its up to me to start the good old
talking machine once more wonder how
many records it will take this time
  an idea ill teach dickie to sing in uni-
son with listen to the mocking bird
it may take months but ive got more time
than anything else just now
  november  i hardly know how to be-
gin something very peculiar has hap-
pened something more than peculiar-it is
positively uncanny in fact i am very
chary about waiting anything at all about it
to-night
  it happened about one oclock i went
outside for a little exercise at that hour
knowing it to be jacks luncheon hour and
therefore feeling sure that i should miss no
messages i limbered up pretty thoroughly
and even started a perspiration and as
i say it was about one when i decided to
come back indoors
  as luck would have it my practice on
the crags had taken me over to the same
side of the house as the spot where i had
hidden fannies cage halfway back i
recalled this fact and would have made a
detour to avoid seeing the thing if i had not
forced myself to keep straight on i al-
most wish now that i had gone around
  it should be mentioned here that the
cage was made of carbo-aluminum wire and
plates a material decidedly antielectric
also when i placed the thing where i did
yesterday i noticed that although the
handful of birdseed on the floor vanished in
a flash of blue flame as soon as exposed to
the etheric current yet the framework was
as sound as ever so the incident cannot be
explained that way
  when i leaping homeward approached
the place where i had left the cage i pur-
posely prepared for a long jump so that
i would see no more than a mere glimpse
of it up i shot into space and while
i spent the usual seconds in mid flight i
gave the surface below a single deliberate
look
  the cage was not there
  my first thought was one of vast relief
i	was glad that i had been spared the
sight then i instantly began to wonder
and next moment i turned in my tracks
and began a thorough search for the
cage
  fifteen minutes later i returned to the
house empty handed and i know that one
thing or the other is true either i am out of
my senses or else something-or some one
-has taken that cage

a novelette-complete in this issue
the governor had been robbed and
the consternation on fort roya
hill sent a ripple of excitement
through the town along the water front
and aboard the ships constables became
alert and the military marched here and
there arresting suspicious looking persons
and smashing open cupboards and lockers
with the butts of their muskets the search
grew in vigor it ran like fire through the
lower town and the anchored and moored
shipping heads were broken and many
arrests were made even the shops and
houses of respectable tradesmen were
searched but the governors jewel case and
two bags of gold were not found
within forty-eight hours of the robbery
on fort royal hill old caleb stave the
ship-chandler of crabhole alley set up a
horrid outcry he could not have made a
more piteous and distracting disturbance if
he had lost his granddaughter sally he
too had been robbed his strong box was
gone
  it was not until night that the ship-
chandler accused his servant griffon of the
theft of the strong box he and griffon
and a black slave named big tom were in
the shop at the time griffon was not sur-
prised at the accusation for the term of his
indenture was almost up and he knew that
stave would go to any length of injustice
to keep him from his freedom he was
not surprised but anger rose in his throat
like a choking hot coal he knew the use-
lessness of denial there was no justice for

him and his kind he was as much a slave
as the black african
   you verminous old liar he cried and
hurled a bag of yams at his master
  the main force of yams struck stave and
carried him to the floor and one vegetable
flew at a tangent and overturned and ex-
tinguished the lantern
   run out back whispered big tom
 de constablers am in front
  old stave yelled murder and as griffon
slipped from the sweltering and odorifer-
ous shop to the foul yard in the rear two
constables and a soldier entered by the front
door the constables had cudgels in their
hands and cutlasses on their hips and one
carried a lantern the soldier had his mus-
ket
   thief thief cried the ship-chandler
 griffon the white man the back door 
the fellow with the lantern tripped over
something and came to the floor with a
crash which knocked all the wind out of
him and doused the light the soldier fell
over the prostrate constable the musket
flew from his grasp and cracked old staves
shins and at that moment the back door
closed the second constable believing
himself in a trap-for the reputation of
crabhole alley was not above suspicion-
laid about him blindly with his cudgel and
brought bolts of sailcloth toppling and
sliding onto the confusion on the floor
  the back door screamed stave
 who shut it pull it open tom
wheres that black
   the lantern  cried the soldier scram-
bling to his feet just in time to check a
swing of the cudgel with his left ear he
collapsed with a grunt old stave found
the door yanked it open leaped forward
caught his foot in the shank of an anchor
which some one had laid across the door-
way pitched head first into a strongly con-
structed hen coop and forgot what the
disturbance was about for a little while
  peter griffon ran for his freedom through
starshine and shadow he headed inland
scaling stone walls dashing and scrambling
from one narrow yard to another but there
were lanes to be crossed and in one of
these he dashed into the midst of a cor-
porals guard he was challenged but
rushed on the corporal made a blind prod
at him and sank an inch of iron in his left
shoulder but he broke away and burst
open a little door in a wall he crashed
the door shut behind him and fled across
the yard and over the farther wall he was
losing blood but he continued to run at
top speed presently he won clear of the
lower town and ran through decent gar-
dens and across lawns in the dense black
shade of bulky trees of mahogany bread-
fruit and mango
  the corporal and his two subordinates
followed on griffons course with a clatter
of arms and an outcry of oaths and threats
and big tom trailed close upon the heels
of the three soldiers silent as a shadow
pausing now and again to touch his right
shin tenderly with an inquiring finger the
thing which the constable with the lantern
had fallen over back in caleb staves shop
had been the africans right leg and it had
not been an accident on toms part he
had given a patch of black hide cheerfully
in a good cause
  the soldiers were soon winded the
cross-belts and high leather stocks of the
military uniforms of that period were not
conducive to prolonged bouts of physical
exertion on a windless tropical night one
by one they crumpled and lay puffing and
big tom passed them one by one like a
shadow
  griffon cleared the last garden of the
town crossed a white road and ducked into
a great field of canes though suffering
desperately from fatigue and loss of blood
he now forced his protesting legs and lungs
to top speed for he had glimpsed a pursuer
among the shrubs of the last garden a few
seconds ago the rows of canes lay at right
angles to the road and the fugitive ran
straight along one of these narrow green
lanes the town was stifling but here
among the tens of thousands of tall close
ranked canes it was strangling like the air
of an oven and it was rank with the reek
of the black heavily manured fortune
bearing old soil the fugitive gasped for
breath stumbled and fell scrambled up
choking and ran on his scanty clothing
sodden with sweat and blood
  big tom saw griffon take to the canes
crab
reef

but he did not enter that airless swelter of
vegetation himself he knew that the white
man would hold that line as straight and
far into the hills as obstacles and fatigue
would permit he turned to the left and
raced ajong the road at amazing speed for
a distance of fifty yards or so then leaped
the ditch and slipped into the maze of shad-
ows and starshine of a grove of limes here
he had clean turf under his feet and ran
with undiminished speed
  griffon staggered out of the canes at last
and flopped in a patch of cassava he lay-
still for a full minute then again rallied his
exhausted body and reeling brain scram-
bled to his feet and moved on at a lurching
jog beyond the cassava the ground began
that upward slope which led eventually to
the hanging jungles and deep ravines of
the mountains
  he blundered through a thicket of bay
trees and essayed the gentle slant of turf
beyond only to fall with a spinning of stars
in his eyes and the thumping of his over-
forced heart in his ears the spinning stars
passed and consciousness with them   
he felt a hand on his shoulder caught
and he was unarmed back to old caleb
stave back to slavery of spirit and body
he groaned like a lost soul
   peter peter said a voice he knew
 vs tied up yer shoulder sit ye up peter
an tiy a sip ob dis yere brandy
   is it you tom for gods sake let
me go  whispered griffon without raising
his head
   let ye go man alive ise goin my-
self try a suck at dis yere bottle boy
an den git yer legs under yerself an come
along
   where to
   to the mountuns peter to de blessed
jungles
  griffon gulped at the bottle which big
tom held to his lips-a bottle stolen from
caleb staves best bin he got his legs
under him then and came slowly to his
feet with the africans help they went
up the gradual slope together at a fair rate
of speed the black mans strong right arm
about the white mans waist thus they
passed fort royal hill well to the left of
it they skirted sloping crops-sugar cane
cassava guinea corn and tobacco-and be-
yond the cultivation got into a gully which
climbed steeply between water-cut banks
fringed with wild bush in the time of rain
this gully runs full with earth reddened
water which stains the clear sea greens and
sea blues hundreds of yards from shore
but now it was dry save for a few still
pools with finger wide trickles of water be-
tween
   let me rest a minute said griffon
 im spent-bled white-legs gone and
lungs afire
  big tom eased him down to the ground
and stood above him hearkening with
bowed head to the faint sounds of the
night
   i was afraid of you tom-but i trust
you now said griffon
  trust me dats right returned big
tom  you an mes in de same boat now
peter it  be de whip an hot iron if dey
catches us
   theyll never take me alive damn
caleb stave 
  they resumed their journey up the rug-
ged gully griffon was still too weak to do
much in the way of locomotion for him-
self he leaned heavily back against big
toms brawny right arm and his knees
sagged at every step but the african
seemed tireless
   i must rest again said griffon
 must have lost quarts of blood
   nope we best keep a-goin replied
tom lifting the other easily in both arms
and moving steadily onward
  after ten minutes griffon spoke again
   theres no chance for us he said
 theyll catch us in a day or a week dead
or alive theyll hunt us with dogs-and
every cursed planter in the island will join
in the hunt the masters and the soldiers
will hunt us and our own kind will help
track us and drag us down-the white
slaves and the black
   maybe we give em de slip peter we
am still alive anyhow
   dont you feel a temptation to take me
back to stave theyd not lay lash nor hot
iron on you if you took me back tom
the african halted at that and set the
white man on his feet before him

argosy-allstory weekly
    ye dont trust me peter
 but-dont you see we havent a
chance dont you see your only chance
   maybe not much-but i take it with
yerself peter-death or freedom
   why
   big tom am yer friend white boy
 i believe you-but youre mad to risk
torture for my sake heres your knife
where ye come by that knife peter
 i took it out of your belt when you
held the bottle to my lips away back there
down the hill if youd gone down instead
of up tom-or so much as turned once in
your tracks-well im a desperate man
 trust big tom an take anudder pull
on dis yere bottle white boy
  the bed of the vanished torrent became
steeper and rougher and narrower deeply
pitted here and there and frequently bar-
ricaded with overhanging ledges of rock
griffon struggled upward manfully with
big toms arm behind him at the difficult
places for a sweltering half hour and then
he fell again the african shouldered him
like a sack of corn and continued the as-
cent
  big tom left the ravine an hour later
scrambling up the left bank with peter
griffon still across his right shoulder the
jungle bulged against him as if it would
roll him back into the gully but he fastened
upon its front of tough vines with his left
hand hung on dragged forward set his
great feet securely ripped an opening and
thrust himself and his burden in
  here was no starshine nor moving air
the place was like the interior of a bakers
oven for both blackness and heat but the
gigantic slave pressed forward inward he
shifted and lowered poor griffon from his
shoulder to his arms clasped him to his
heaving breast turned then and presented
his back to the tangle by sheer weight
and strength he burst his way backward into
the maze of vegetation for a distance of
several yards vines snapped near and far
and lost their holds with rips and rendings
to right and left and high and low as if
the whole wood were coming down big
tom was delighted with himself at these
indications of his physical prowess
   bust im boy bust im he mut-
tered  you am more powerfuller nor dis
yere jungle big tom samson rip im
down black boy 
  but after a few yards the jungle held
him he was forced to drop griffon and
turn and cut thick cables of vine with his
knife
  even big toms herculean limbs and
lungs of leather succumbed at last for a
time to the vast and continuous pressure
of the jungles resistance he crumpled
and before he could regain his feet sleep
overcame him
  there was a twilight of filtered sunshine
in the jungle when the runaways awoke
they were parched with thirst and hungry
and griffon was faint and sore the brandy
bottle had been broken during the struggle
inward from the gully big tom searched
about for food slashing his way here and
there and in time found a mango tree the
fruit was ripe the yellow pulp soppy with
juice and the fugitives sucked eagerly
fairly guzzled despite the overwild turpen-
tiny flavor for hours after that they
pushed along higher into the mountains and
deeper into the jungle big tom cutting and
bursting the way and peter griffon follow-
ing weakly
  their track through the ropy browns
and massed greens closed behind them and
vanished like the wake of a diver in green
water they rested often the air was
sweltering and a cloud of insects hummed
about them big tom covered the blood-
soaked rags on his companions shoulder
with a pad of wide green leaves
   i been dis far once before he said as
they lay gasping
  griffon moved his head as an indication
that he had heard but neither opened his
eyes nor spoke
   come man huntin continued big
tom  dat was before stave take me from
my old master for bad debt-three years
ago maybe we chase runaway boy named

  griffon sat up and opened his eyes
   and henry he asked  did they
find him-dead or alive
   dont never find im dead nor alive
replied the other
   dead nevertheless-of starvation or
fever-as we shall be dead in a few days

year ago-in crabhole alley he looks
like old old woman in white skirts an big
yaller handkerchief with big basket cryin
sweet cakes to sell i know her for henry

one finger she make to me-but a white
man walk close behind me so i dont stop
an when i come back she wasnt to be
spied nowhere in crabhole alley
  they resumed the struggle against the
jungle thirst and hunger burned and
gnawed them big tom made blind strokes
with his knife fumbling strokes griffon
babbled of other days of apples and cider
and old trees with mistletoe in their branch-
es he fell frequently and cursed big tom
every time for picking him up at last big
tom let him lie regarded him helplessly
for a few seconds and then lay down beside
him the knife that had slashed so far into
the jungles tough heart slipped unheeded
from the black fingers
  big tom was not beaten however he
got to his feet again hours later picked up
his knife and his unconscious companion
and renewed the unequal conflict he
bucked the jungle desperately with his
friend in his arms he burst through a
screen of vines

  peter griffon was aware of being car-
ried but thought nothing of it later he
felt a breath of wind on face and body
he -was dully conscious of being lowered
and tenderly deposited on something softer
than the ground but it was not until his
    	a
bead was raised and he felt the moist rim
of a cup set against his lips that he paid
much attention to what was happening he
drank deep of the cool water and then
opened his eyes
  he was in a rustic shelter which stood
open to the front open to an invigorating
bustle of sea breeze in drooping foliage and
flashes and glimmers of the sea beyond he
heard the roll and burst and welter of surf
far below him on his right sat big tom
an earthen bowl between his knees from
which he scooped hot morsels of baked yam
and baked fish with greedy fingers on his
left still with a supporting arm back of
him knelt the man who had given him
water he was white but where sun and
wind had worked on him he was tanned
to the hue of an old belt blue eyes shone
out of his weathered mask with startling
pallor and fire he was shaved clean chin
and cheek and lip
  he was not a young man and yet even
in repose he had not the air of an old
one his face was netted with fine wrinkles
and the skin of his hands was also wrinkled
and appeared to be too large for the flesh
and bones within
   who are you asked griffon
   a friend answered the other  xo
slave owner nor magistrate nor man hunter
ye played in luck lad when ye tumbled
head first onto the rocks o me own little
water hole lay back now an ill fetch e
some good broth
  he lowered griffons head and went
nimbly from the shelter light on his feet
as a cat but queerly stooped from the hips
griffon felt an upflame of hope he rolled
over onto his sound shoulder and eyed big
tom who was now polishing the empty
dish
   who is he tom he asked  and
where are we
   dat the man we need most in dis whole
island replied the revived giant  sailor
penny am his name henry tell me he
find dat poor black boy henry three years
ago an henry find us down by de water
hole dis mornin where we fall outer de
jungle onto our heads
   henry the runaway slave they were
going to whip to death

  big tom nodded
   so it was him you saw in crabhole
alley rigged up like an old woman
  the other nodded again and at that
moment sailor penny entered the shelter
with a steaming bowl in his hands big
tom sniffed and rolled his eyes
   no more for e yet a while said the
oldish man in the tone of a nurse to a
greedy child  not quite enough be bet-
ter nor a gorge for a flappin belly-but ill
maybe give e a roasted fowl in an hour or
two or some such trifle
  he fed the hot broth to griffon with
a wooden spoon it was masterly broth
comforting the stomach and tingling along
the arteries like wine after swallowing the
last drop of it and licking the spoon grif-
fon lay flat again and slept
  he awoke an hour later and found him-
self alone in the rustic shelter he sat up
he was his own man again save for the
small matter of a soreness and stiffness in
his bandaged shoulder he looked at the
thatched roof and the frail walls of woven
palm leaves and wondered at the fragile
character of the place two low pallets
made up of dried grasses and folded pieces
of old sailcloth comprised the furnishings
he was still wondering when sailor penny
entered slipping in from the sunshine with
that queer stoop which gave him an appear-
ance of eager haste
   feelin brisker mate he asked squat-
ting close in front of the fugitive
   a thousand times better in mind an in
body replied griffon  you have saved
my life nay you have given me life for
there is no life in slavery
   handsomely spoke returned the
other  drink this
  griffon drained the cup obediently the
draft was bitter but cool and not unpleas-
ant
   where is big tom he asked
  somewheres below ground with
henry
   a cave
   aye ye may say so i trust ye mate-
by yer eyes an i trust tom for what
henry tells of im but ye hail from a bad
quarter lad-a tricky quarter
    meaning crabhole alley
   meanin the shop an sarvice o caleb
stave
   tricky man if you knew him as i
do yed lay a stronger word on him lis-
ten to me master penny-an make what
you choose of it if i saw old caleb stave
staggering an tottering on the edge of the
red hot pit of everlasting damnation yelling
for help and it was in my power to pluck
him to safety-id push him in-so hear me
god almighty 
  for several seconds the two men stared
at each other in silence
    iiali  breathed the elder dimming the
blue blaze of his eyes and relaxing the lines
of mouth and jaw  i believe e mate
ye know im tell me why ye hate
im so
   griffon too relaxed suddenly in attitude
and manner and expression of face he
glanced around him
   but are we safe here he whispered
 what if theyve laid the hounds on our
scent we lie here defenseless
  the other smiled and shook his head
   ye be safe here lad-safe as the gov-
ernor in his great house on fort royal
hill he said
  so griffon told him he had been in
caleb staves service at caleb staves
mercy these past three years these were
the last years of the term of ten for which
he had been transported to the plantations
he said nothing just then of the seven pre-
ceding years of his slavery beyond men-
tioning the fact that he had beeen sold into
staves hands from the island of st kitts
he told only of the bitter nightmare of his
relations with the ship-chandler of crabhole
alley
  it had speedily become evident to him
that stave was dissatisfied with his bar-
gain the truth of that matter had soon
come to light stave had made a mistake
he had purchased three years of griffons
indentured slavery under the misapprehen-
sion that he was acquiring the expert ser-
vices of one grissin a cutpurse and house-
breaker upon learning that his servant
had never cut a purse or picked a lock he
had heaped indignities and cruelties on him
at the same time leading others to believe
that the poor devil was in reality the ruf-
crab
reef

lian whom he himself had thought and
hoped him to be at the time of the purchase
himself hating griffon for his honesty he
had caused others to despise and distrust
the unfortunate servant for the lack of it
  that was caleb stave that was ever
caleb staves way he had given the poor
clog a bad name even while humiliating
overworking starving and whipping him for
being an honest dog
  caleb stave had a granddaughter in his
house she was an orphan she was young
and innocent and also beautiful and kind
for months she had looked upon griffon
with fear and distaste but in the course
of time with pity despite his black reputa-
tion and at last after hearing something
of the truth she had looked upon him with
kindness
  the ship-chandler had smelled out the
situation and given it his close and crooked
attention he had seen in it an opportunity
for the kind of double play in which his
verminous soul delighted so he had gone
softly about it and next morning the girl
had run to him with the startling informa-
tion that most of her trinkets were missing
from her treasure box the inadequate lock
of which had been burst stave had called
griffon to him and despite the girls pro-
tests had accused the outcast of the theft
  griffon had stared dazedly not knowing
exactly what to deny whereupon the old
devil had plucked and torn at the unfortu-
nates scanty and ragged clothing and
brought to light two or three of the
missing trinkets griffon had flared out at
that recklessly denied the theft and any
knowledge of it with curses and named the
old man for a rogue a cheat a liar a cow-
ard and a being so vile in himself and so
low in his dirty gutter origin as to be scarce-
ly human and he had shaken his fist in
his masters face and cried some foolishness
about his own quality of blood and ances-
try
  me had played the outraged gentleman
for a minute or two poor devil his words
and his scorn had succeeded in cutting
stave to the quick and for his success he
had been held by one negro and whipped
by another until he fainted while the old
man forced the girl to look on
  griffons lot had been harder after that
he had been worked to the bone and under-
fed he had been steadily worn down in
body from strength to quivering weakness
and every effort had been made to wear
down his spirit as well and his mind or
break them utterly
  he had been set to the most humiliating
the most degrading tasks thwacked and
jeered at by his master and the spanish
mulatto foreman so nearly had his courage
been broken that he had once tried to take
his own life his shaking hand had saved
him he had been doctored for the wound
fed back to a degree of strength and then
whipped to unconsciousness that had
taught him a lesson-and his next effort
with the knife had been directed against
the spanish mulatto in this also he had
failed and for the attempt he had been
beaten with a supplejack
  things had improved for him soon after
that despite staves best efforts to break
his manhood the mulatto who was a free-
man had been killed in a drunken brawl on
the water front then the girl had discov-
ered her lost trinkets one day in her grand-
fathers bedroom at the bottom of a box in
which he kept his private store of liquor
she had told griffon and begged his for-
giveness for ever having doubted his hon-
esty-but she feared to tell the old man
her sympathy had lightened griffons spir-
itual and mental darkness and then big
tom who had been bought to replace the
deceased free mulatto had shown him sur-
reptitious kindness
  griffon leaned forward and grasped one
of his attentive hosts thin wrists with his
clawlike right hand his eyes glowed
   stave accused me of robbing him he
exclaimed in a hate bitten whisper  i was
within a few days of my freedom a lie
to save himself and damn me another
double trick to save himself and enslave
me forever but i was helpless who
will believe a slave so i struck him down
and ran i downed him with a bag of
yams listen i knew enough to hang him
but i ran for my freedom for who would
have believed what i could tell or even
if one had believed would he admit it the
slave against the master

   the soldiers and constables were search-
ing every house and shop for jewels and
money robbed from fort royal they had
been at it night and day they came to
crabhole alley smashing doors and ripping
beds poking everywhere tearing up floors
prodding holes in yards and gardens-and
they were at caleb staves front door dye
see it listen to me i knew the truth-
the truth to hang him-but i was helpless
   he had yelled of robbery that morning
as soon as the constables came into the alley
-of the robbery of his strong box-and
now he named me for the thief-and the sol-
diers at the door dye see it so i ran-
for id have been found twice guilty had i
tried to show his guilt-jor he had buried
his own strong box in the earth under the
floor oj that stinking shop-along with the
bags of jewels and gold which he had robbed
from the governors house now dye get
it dye understand
   first he had robbed the governor and
hidden the stuff-but that i did not see
next when the search drew near he was
afraid and hid some of his own money in
his own strong box with the other-and
that i saw spying on him through a crack
and then he yelled that hed been robbed
that was to draw off the hunt from his
shop then he brought the hunters to his
door and named me for a thief dye see
it
   but if yed showed em-
   if id shown them-man dont you see
it yet would magistrates believe my tale
think you-that the old devil had robbed
himself no id be punished for both
robberies hanged and the governor
would reward caleb stave
   i git it mate now tell me this did
stave know that ye knew about im-that
ye spied on him
   he didnt know it he doesnt know
it
   not about ye knowin where he buried
the blunt
   no for a certainty he didnt catch
me spying i didnt tell him what i knew
i gave him the lie and ran for it he had
accused me just to break me-and to save
himself if the stuff should be found by any
chance a double play you see
   aye double an deep deep as hell
an the blunt mate where would it be
now
   where i saw it he wont shift it till
the dangers past
  sailor penny nodded reflectively then
went away and soon returned with another
bowl of invigorating broth

  before sunset sailor penny took peter
griffon to the edge of the cliff before the
shelter and pointed downward griffon saw
a strip of still water about one hundred
yards in width and three times as long at
the foot of the cliff this was sheltered
from the outer commotion by a crescent of
black reef against which the seas rocked
up and rode straight and burst to froth as
white as snow midway the reef where
it was highest and widest squatted a frag-
ment of an old hulk-twenty feet or so of
stove keel unplanked ribs crusted with
shells and weeds a ragged butt of bowsprit
and a stump of foremast
   it be a proper island at neap an no
more nor a strip at full an all a-wash at
flood said penny  ive set here manys
the time for hours o moonlit nights pic-
turin caleb stave on that there reef with-
out boat nor raft to bring im off
   you have queried griffon surprised
 so you know him too
   ive heard tell of im from more nor
yerself mate up an down the islands these
man years ashore an afloat hed look
uncommon well on that there reef without
raft nor boat blast his fishy deadlights
 hed swim ashore you dont know
the inhuman beastliness of that old man or
yed wish him worse than that as i do i
wish him in hell hes had me in hell
down in the red hot slime of it these three
years torturing me soul and body thats
where i wish caleb stave-for a thousand
years
   he wouldnt swim ashore no fear

   you would starve him good 
   nay he wouldnt starve
crab reef	
   not starve what then 
    that be an uncommon bit o reef lad
ive seen the same north about the tor-
tugas but come along now an ill show
e somethink else afore dark
  he led the way back to the shelter went
to the rear of it and thrust a hand up into
the thatch a flake of dull metallic surface
was exposed to view
   what is it asked griffon who was be-
ginning to entertain suspicions of sailor
pennys mental condition
   a pewter dish answered penny  a
lookout forrard a sentinel safety
griffon smiled indulgently and shook his
head
   it shows from the outside broad an
bright continued the other  but only
from one angle over yonder scouts the
turtle along me brook an strip o clear-
ance from sunup to sundown-an he
knows the angle if he sights a stranger
up he climbs into the highest o the right
trees up to the angle for a glimpse o this
here pewter dish an takes a shoot at it
maybe two o us be settin here in the cool-
or three maybe-when ping goes the pewter
dish an down we goes underground leavin
nothink for a stranger to see save this here
old shelter what a shipwrecked sailor might
rig an sleep under a night or two
  griffon was impressed and puzzled
   but the turtle what dye mean by
a turtle climbing trees
   injun carib good lad the turtle-
an smart as paint
  ah an aborigine what does he
shoot with
   me own cross-bow the best that ever
sped iron tipped quarrel i took it off a
flemming shipmaster years ago it shoots
farther an truer nor dag or pistolet an
without the bang an now ill show e
somethink else
  they left the shelter and entered the
edge of the jungle at a point about twenty
yards away sailor penny lay flat and wrig-
gled forward beneath the tangle a distance
of six or eight yards griffon followed
him close penny got to his feet and
climbed into the branches of a tree of dense
growth and low branches disappearing in a
few seconds in the upper tangle of green and
brown griffon followed slowly with con-
siderable difficulty
  he reached a narrow platform of sticks
lashed securely together to form an aerial
den in the upper depths of green obscurity
and jungle mystery there penny was wait-
ing for him and led him halfway around the
tree trunk on foot ropes of living vines re-
enforced with cordage and along a hori-
zontal limb on hands and knees where they
were enveloped in screens of hanging tangle
penny swung beneath the limb on the twist-
ed jungle net went down hand under hand
and in a second was swallowed from grif-
fons sight griffon followed awkwardly
because of his disabled left arm but the
descent was not difficult for good hemp
cordage was rove among the vines and rat-
lines were set as in a ships shrouds
  he sank into a dense tide of snarled vege-
tation and found penny waiting for him
again among the roots of things in a space
circumscribed as a ships forecastle hatch
walled and roofed with foliage and stem and
tendril the only light was an amber dusk
from high overhead penny chuckled
stooped fumbled at the ground for a sec-
ond then raised the lid of a black hole
   the after hatch he said swinging it
lightly up and back until it reclined against
the jungle wall he lowered himself into
the hole shoulder deep griffon joined him
there whereupon penny reached over and
brought the light hinged door of wicker
work and woven grass into place above their
bowed heads
  sailor penny had an extraordinary estab-
lishment underground which he shared with
an extraordinary company here was a
cave in the living rock older than humanity
and almost as crooked as the ways of caleb
stave with a seaweed vent halfway up the
face of the seventy-foot cliff this vent
a horizontal crack in the rock had been
originally of considerable extent but had
been filled up with roughly dressed stone
from both ends to within six feet of the
center
  this aperture as wide as a gate but no
more than two feet high was hidden from
seaward eyes-so penny said-by a narrow
ledge just below it across the face of the
cliff and a thin veil of creepers pendent from

argosy-allstory weekly
above it stood wide open to a drift of
salty breeze when griffon first glanced
through it at the dimming sea and the first
stars but a moment later at a word from
penny two black fellows closed it with a
grating of oak and rusty iron
   dye fear an attack from the sea to-
night asked griffon
   aye well be attacked to-night same
as usual replied penny casually
   same as usual i thought this a secret
stronghold
   aye secret enough from our human
enemies
  again griffon felt a doubt of the old
mans sanity and at the same moment
a daunting sensation of chilliness between
his shoulder blades and up the back of his
neck he cast an apprehensive glance at
the grating and the fast deepening night
beyond it
   but what else dye fear he asked
with scores of old tales of sea devils and sea
ghosts stirring in his mind
  sailor penny ignored the question took
him by a hand and led him back to an in-
ner chamber of the cave here against one
rocky wall and screened by hanging mats
of woven grass burned a clear fire beneath
two iron pots the thin smoke from the
firm dry fuel crept up a vertical crevice in
the wall and vanished in the gloom high
overhead the runaway slave named henry
w-as in attendance upon the pots and big
tom and two other negroes and a small
man as dark as they but thin featured and
straight haired squatted close at hand
  this last was the turtle the carib the
watchman with the flemish cross-bow the
strange blacks were runaway slaves from the
south side of the island who had escaped
to sailor pennys sanctuary three months
before
   ive had as many as eight below hatches
here at the one time not countin the tur-
tle explained penny  eight runaways
an two of em dentured white men like yer-
self mate one o that lot died for lack
o the blood he lost breakin away
   what became of the others asked
griffon
  i got em clean off-but me signal was
flyin nigh onto a month before i could ship
em some of em be coral now like
enough an some of em under overseers
lashes agin maybe-but i done me best-
give em their freedom an a clean run to
hold it
   you shipped them away from her
   aye an dozens afore that lot an
maybe a dozen since i been here fifteen
years lad
   and yet youve not escaped yourself
 escaped i be a free man mate-me
own master
   yet you remain here in hiding and suc-
cor runaway slaves at risk of your life
   a diversion lad it passes the time o
waitin henry serve the stew
  griffon asked more questions of his host
during supper but failed to get anything
better than a wag of the head for answer
and immediately after supper he was shown
to a far corner of the cave where a thin
mattress was spread for him beside pennys
couch he lay down and was within a
blink of sleep when he was disturbed by
the poke of a finger in the ribs
   where were e when e seen stave bury
the blunt whispered penny
   in the loft he replied impatiently
longing to resign himself to the sweet light
pressure on lids and brain
   an ye seen him lift the floor an bury
it in a corner
   yes nay not in a corner behind the
counter-midway-with coils of rope atop
iv
  both sailor penny and henry were gone
from the cave when peter griffon awoke
from his first night of slumber in that queer
sanctuary though he ached from scalp
to heel he felt a new kick of life in him
  big tom brought him breakfast and
bathed and dressed his shoulder when he
went to the front of the cave he found
the sun high and the grating removed from
the long window it was then that big
tom told him that their host and henry
had gone away at the first clear break of
daylight and that all hands with the ex-
ception of the turtle were to remain un-
derground until their return by master
pennys orders
crab
reef

  griffon was startled by an unpleasant
suspicion
 would he play us false he whispered
 xo fear o dat replied tom  what
for would he make known all de secret
ways o dis yere cave to us if he didnt mean
to act honest by us
   and why not if he shipped us far
enough away he said he had shipped
dozens like us white and black out of the
island dye think he goes to all this bother
and labor and danger for the love of poor
devils like you and me
   but henry say dey goes free de old
man dont sell em henry make one vyage
himself two years ago he go away free
and he come back free six months later
   and what manner of voyage was that
big tom did not know henry had not
given a clear account of the trip having
no appetite for the sea and its roaring perils
he had been glad to get back to master
penny with a whole skin and two handfuls
of gold
   there you have it exclaimed griffon
 freedom aye freedom with a ven-
geance-until yere sped in a bloody fight
or taken alive and hanged by the neck
two handfuls of gold dont you see it
tom its the buccaneers who take pen-
nys runaways off his hands the buc-
caneers-and theyre naught but murdering
pirates nowadays 
  big tom accepted this disclosure calmly
griffon was dejected he saw himself help-
less between an ignominious death on one
hand and an unthinkable life of brutality
on the other for the glory of the old
buccaneers of the free companions was a
thing of the past that hardy and des-
perate fellowship had preyed upon spain
upon the proud and ruthless enemy of eng-
land and humanity-but those days and
conditions were gone and the old name was
now applied to crews of beasts as devoid
of courage as of mercy
  twice during the day the two fugitives
attempted to leave the cave by the way they
had entered but each time they found the
turtle with his cross-bow on guard at the
mouth of the tunnel and each time the
carib had turned them back with a gesture
of the hand and a shoot of the eye not
to be denied they considered the sea-
ward vent as a way of escape they could
easily have reached the narrow ledge by
way of the crack in the face of the cliff
and with the help of a rope they could
have descended from the ledge to the lagoon
-but as they were without a boat of any
sort all that would have been worse than
useless
  the day passed without the return of
sailor penny and henry the turtle came
below at sunset and took command the
heavy grating was again placed in the aper-
ture overlooking the sea and the black reef
and the evening meal was cooked and eaten
  peter griffon retired early but he did not
sleep for a long time he lay still hearing
nothing but the snores and snorts of his
slumbering companions then he left his
couch and moved noiselessly about the
caves he became aware of a faint pulsing
sound light on the ear but large on the
mind like the running and pounding of surf
greatly muffled and for a time he believed
it to be the voice of the seas commotion
out in front along the base of the cliff and
the reef beyond but he changed his mind
it did not come from the front-or not en-
tirely so at least-but from beneath it
pulsed under his feet under the floor of
rock on which he stood telling of a second
and lower cave into which the tide rolled
    thats their water gate their sallyport
and doubtless they have a safe way down
to it and boats hidden somewhere he told
himself
  it did not interest him particularly for
he had no intention of attempting to escape
just then in an open boat he would wait
to learn more of this sailor penny and
his subterranean ways
  he moved toward the front of the cave
and presently heard another sound ahead
he paused for a moment then continued
his advance with the utmost caution the
sound grew as he approached the grated
seaward aperture it was a composite
sound made up of crackings and rattlings
and harsh scrapings and he thought of the
nightly attack from the sea of which sailor
penny had spoken and all the old tales he
had ever heard of sea devils and the like
flashed across his mind

argosy-allstory weekly
  he paused again and struggled for the
space of half a dozen quickened heart beats
with a frantic impulse to retreat to the far-
thest corner of the cave and his snoring
companions but he mastered this cowardly
impulse and went forward again
  he looked for a faint gleam of starshine
at the grated vent but he could not see it
he continued to advance toward the appall-
ing and mysterious confusion of sounds un-
til they seemed to arise from within a yard
or two of him and at the same moment an
almost overpowering stench of deep sea
things assailed his nostrils and breathed
coldly and clammily on his face-the stench
and breath of watery depths of weed sod-
den with the undertows of a thousand tides
of barnacles and rotted wreckage and salty
slime and death
  he stood his ground though he wavered
and swayed for a moment he caught a
gleam of starshine close in front of him
but it vanished in a fraction of a second
he caught another which was gone as swift-
ly as the first then he realized that things
-the devil only knew what manner of
things-filled the seaward vent of the cave
fighting and clawing at the grating of rusty
iron
  peter griffon sank to his knees unnerved
by a sickening horror wild conjectures
surged through his shuddering mind but
he did not retreat and presently he mas-
tered his horror sufficiently to raise and ad-
vance his hand and a short stick he held
toward the point where he knew the grating
stood securely wedged in its frame of rock
he felt the iron bars-and other things as
hard-but alive-things as hard as the iron
which moved beneath the point of his stick
  he jabbed the stick frantically here and
there through the grating and at every jab
something loosed and fell and he heard a
thud on the rocky ledge below and at every
thrust a shining gap of starlight appeared
for a moment against the grating-a gap
almost as wide as a cavaliers hat the
gaps were obliterated refilled as fast as
he made them and soon his arm work
slackening in speed the stick was gripped
and all but snatched from his hand
  he yanked hard on it yanked and pulled
until it came away with a tearing sound
he felt the end of it with his fingers and
found the tough wood shredded like hair
for a distance of four or five inches from
the tip
  then he knew these monsters against
whom the seaward entrance to the cave was
so strongly barred every night were giant
crabs he had heard gruesome tales of
certain reefs and keys of the tortugas to
the north to which just such beasts as
these swarmed up every night from black
depths whereon bones of men who had
been cast ashore alive and dead lay white
as new coral he remembered one tale
of a big negro who had been dragged to
earth and killed and stripped of his flesh
in the sight and hearing of a canoe load of
would-be rescuers now he understood the
significance of sailor pennys remarks con-
cerning the reef it was a comfort to know
that penny was not crazy
  peter returned to his mat and slept until
aroused by the good scents of yams and
fish roasting and broiling for breakfast
v
  another day passed and another night
before the reappearance of sailor penny
and his man henry the manner of their
return was surprising to peter and big
tom
  the inmates of the cave had been awake
only a few minutes and the fire of dry
vines had just begun to flame and crackle
beneath the pot when a shrill whistle from
somewhere underfoot caused the turtle to
lay aside his culinary tasks and hasten to-
ward the front of the cave the others fol-
lowed him when halfway to the seaward
window-from which the grating had not
yet been removed for the day-he stepped
aside to a shadowy recess in the left-hand
wall he reappeared in a second with the
end of a stout rope to which a large iron
hook was attached
  he stooped to the center of the floor
of smooth rock brushed a layer of stone
dust away and lifted an iron ring from a
little hole in the rock into this ring he
slipped the hook then after waving the
curious spectators back from the center of
the floor he retired again into the dusky
crab reef

recess and next moment they heard the
creaking of a windlass and then beheld a
great square of the floor a hatch of rock
rise slowly to a sound of grinding hinges
  the first thing to appear from those
black depths-from which arose the slosh
and sob of uneasy waters over weedy rocks
-was the woolly pate of henry the rest
of him followed swiftly he bore on his
back a light bundle wrapped in water-
proofed canvas and securely tied sailor
penny rose close on his heels empty hand-
ed smiling genially around at the astonished
company
  after breakfast penny took griffon for-
ward to the crack in the living rock over-
looking the lagoon and the reef and the
bright sea beyond he smoked tobacco
not in a pipe but in a long roll of leaf
after the spanish style and seemed to be
in a high humor
   we dealt yer enemy a rude shog me
lad he said  even now crabhole alley
rings from end to end with his lamentations
ye may lay to that we robbed him of
whats dearer to him nor his own immortal
soul did me an henry at that he fell
to chuckling but suddenly his mood
changed his eyes darkened and his mouth
hardened  but the measure is not yet
heaped to overflowin the debt is not yet
paid he added grimly
   what mischief have you done him
asked griffon
   his gold and silver returned the
other  for a piece of gold he would bear
false witness against his brother for a piece
of silver he would cheat a friend for a
penny he would trick a blind beggar we
robbed him of his buried strong box and
along with it of the treasure he stole from
the governor did me an henry we found
the blunt in the very spot you said me lad
  griffon stared at him incredulous
   and we digged it up he continued
 aye an we fetched it clean away-caleb
staves blood sweated money and the gov-
ernors bloody treasure
  griffon continued to stare speechless
amazed sailor penny waved a hand to-
ward the sunshine and sea glimmer in front
and below
   and it lays there he continued  out
there on that sweet bit o reef with a patch
o sailcloth an a few coral rocks to hold
it down-all them broad pieces an flashin
rich gems
   out there queried griffon in a dazed
whisper  on the reef
   aye lad as sure as the whip o the
tyrant has run red with yer blood-as sure
as you an me be exiles from our sweet
english places hidin in our earths like
hunted foxes-aye as sure- he ceased
speaking but continued to gaze out at the
shine and glimmer with unwinking eyes
   is it true that you have robbed stave
asked the young man
  penny turned to him and replied smil-
ing  have patience for a little while an
ye shall know ye shall see the days
of caleb stave are numbered by his own
black greed shall he be destroyed as surely
as hell awaits him-as surely as he has
proved faithless to every man who trusted
him and blind and deaf to every one who
ever asked mercy or succor of him
   who are you asked griffon strangely
moved
   a berkshire man like verself-aye an
like caleb stave have ye forgot perny-
fold the little farm on the downs griffon
land aye but farmed by pennies close onto
two hundred years honest yeomen all-
until the hunger for worldly place gripped
my heart i was an only child i had
schoolin above my own father an idleness
above my station i coursed hares on the
downs with the squires son i was half a
gentleman-god pity me an the ambition
gripped me to be all of one and the
squires son was my friend he gave me
money an so i went away from berk-
shire an clean away from old england to
find a fortune
    the master o the first ship i sailed in
was a thief an a cheat-aye an worse-

an sold them to the plantations he spirited
away little english children an sold them
into slavery but ye know the accursed

in that time i saw hudderkin walk the

berkshire man to my door ragged an

clothed an fed him later i gave him work

partner in my business i withheld nothing
from him of my past or present and we
prospered together for years and then he
was revealed to me all of a sudden in a
flash-the devil he was the false friend the
trickster and liar
   in that flash i saw myself childless and
poor-for he had estranged my children
from me and robbed me of my worldly gear
i made to tear out his throat with my
hands but they dragged me away then
he denounced me for a pirate an sent for
the constables an the soldiers but i es-

high at court - they were land hungry and
he was blood proud he is a proud man
or else a very saint who bows only to god
almighty my father bowed only to god
and yet he was no saint they goaded him
to rashness to defiance to the utterance of
wild and violent words at home and at court
-and at last to a thing to which they gave
the name of high treason i was soldiering
in flanders when my fathers head fell in

vi
  three days passed during which time
sailor penny did not say more than half a
dozen words to peter griffon on any one
occasion nor give a satisfactory answer to
any one of a score of questions they
were uneventful days griffon and big
tom were given several airings above
ground but always under the eye of henry
or the turtle or penny himself and the
seaward vent of the cave was grated against
the hungry crabs each night and good food
was cooked and eaten daily in generous por-
tions griffons strength returned to him
swiftly on the morning of the fourth day
he awoke to discover sailor penny and
henry gone again
  inspired by consuming curiosity and
something greater and deeper to which he
was unable to affix a name griffon kept
watch for the return of the old man and
henry each night as soon as his com-
panions were sound asleep he took his mat
forward to within a yard of the grating
and there between naps he arose frequently
crab
reef

and prodded the great clawing crabs away
from the iron bars and looked forth at the
starlit lagoon and black reef he always
returned to his place at the back of the
cave before dawn so that the turtle should
not suspect his vigilant curiosity thus
three nights of vigil passed without reward
  on the fourth night late having made
himself a peephole with his stick in the wall
of ravenous crabs for the tenth time he
glimpsed something unusual out in the star-
shine and pale fire of phosphorescent waters
it was a small boat drawing in to the sea-
ward side of the reef he had no more
than glimpsed this thing than the cleared
spot on the grating was refilled then he
prodded with grim determination and fran-
tic haste knocking a great crab clear of
the rusty iron at every prod and then he
became aware of an amazing thing the
crabs were all gone from the grating-which
was a strange enough thing in itself-but
stranger still they did not return he could
hear them scraping and scrambling down
the face of the cliff
  griffon looked out at the low black reef
and the black boat beyond the boat was
close in against the tide washed coral a
man leaped from its bows to the reef and
the boat backed off there looked to be
something queer about the reef-or was it
the starshine it seemed to quiver from end
to end as if alive-to squirm without shift-
ing its position-to wrinkle its rough back
in thousands of changing knobs and ridges
and what was wrong with the man who
had leaped so eagerly ashore there but a
moment before
  he staggered like a drunkard he fell
and staggered up again screaming his
screams were of sheer horror he sprang
to the edge of the water still screaming-
but the boat continued to draw away from
him he ran heavily to the ridge of the
reef fell again staggered up once more
and now he looked to be bulkier of outline-
lumpy-distorted now there was agony
as well as terror in his resounding outcry
he struggled toward the old hulk of wreck-
age as if seeking refuge heavily slowly
only to fall in a moment for the third and
last time his terrible screams ceased as
suddenly as if a hand had been clamped
upon his mouth the boat vanished in the
hazy starshine the black surface of the
reef continued to quake and crawl
vii
  the sun wras above the seas edge and
griffon had fallen at last into uneasy sleep
when the occupants of the upper cave heard
sailor pennys shrill signal from the watery
cavern below griffon awoke and sprang
to his feet the windlass was manned the
stone hatch was raised
  henry was the first to rise from the
depths he grinned around him but there
was a grayness in his black skin and a wild
light of relief in his eyes without a word
he cast the hook clear of the ring in the
stone and lowered it down the hole he
sent the turtle back to the windlass with
a wave of the hand
   hoist away rang the voice of penny
from the depths
  the windlass creaked and henry steadied
the ascending rope with his hands leaning
out over the open hatch a package
wrapped in wet sailcloth and strongly roped
about came into view topped the level
of the floor and was dragged aside by
henry it was small but it was heavier
than lead again the rope was lowered
down the hatch to the unseen boat and
again came sailor pennys cry of  hoist
away once more henry leaned over and
steadied the ascending rope with both
hands
  this was a very different load from the
first this w-as no inanimate package done
up in wet sailcloth but a young woman
seated in a bight of rope as she stepped
upon the floor of the cave peter griffon
cried out in a voice of incredulous joy
whereupon she ran to him and was clasped
tight in his arms
  then came sailor penny himself up from
the weltering black depths by way of the
sea ladder of rope and ratlines bearing on
his right shoulder an oblong box of red
wood studded and banded with tarnished
silver he beamed at the assembled com-
pany only griffon and the young woman
did not see him or if they saw him did
not heed him he stepped over to them

on his shoulder

  sailor penny and the turtle and the
blacks ate hearty breakfasts penny and
henry in particular devouring broiled snap-
per and roasted yams and plantains and
topping off with luscious mangoes and swig-
ging rum and water with the air of men
who had achieved a laudable task and de-
served well of the world only griffon and
the girl were indifferent to the good food
between the powerful emotions of joy and
disgust their appetites were entirely upset
  they sat side by side hand in hand now
gazing each into the others eyes now whis-
pering one into the others ear words of be-
wildered and incredulous delight now star-
ting anu trembling at a thought of the na-
ture of caleb staves death they felt
nothing of pity for that old beast-the an-
gel of mercy himself would have felt no
pity for that vile crusher of human hopes
and breaker of human lives but the mem-
ory of the screams they had heard the
one in the open boat and the other in the
cave shook them with loathsome horror
  old sailor penny was in high spirits
the patience of long and perilous years
was rewarded the work of years was
crowned his dream through years of heart-
ache and fear and humiliation and hardship
was on the verge of realization the score
had been paid hell had been fed by way
of the black reef hate was satisfied the
days of his exile were numbered and wealth
was in his hand and he saw the green berk-
shire downs and the weathered thatches of
pennyfold again with eyes of youth
  within a week or two or a month at the
most a good ship would appear in the of-
fing flying a signal fate chance luck-
call it what you will-had played his game
at the last with both hands not only was
he himself avenged but the son of the high
and unfortunate friend of his youth was
avenged not only was wealth recovered
but the daughter of his own son was dis-
covered and reclaimed from the unknown
not only had he retaken much of the world-
ly treasure of which caleb stave had
robbed him years ago but with it he had
taken the far greater treasure of jewels
which stave had stolen from the governor
he was in high spirits
  breakfast was finished and cleared away
the turtle went aloft to gather fruit and
vegetables and to scout around henry
rolled over on his back and fell asleep
and after regarding him admiringly for a
few minutes two others of the fugitives
followed his example old penny and the
lovers and big tom moved to the front of
the cave and made themselves comfortable
on couches of old sails in the line of a
breeze from the sea the rusty grating had
been removed from the long crack and
waves and sky flashed with celestial tints
beyond the frame of dark rock from their
low seats nothing was to be seen of the
tragic reef
  the old mans eyes were glistening as if
he had never lost an hours sleep in his life
his smile was as bright as his eyes his
leathery visage fairly shone with benevo-
lence and content he puffed on a thin
roll of tobacco which he had lit before leav-
ing the cooking fire expelling the azure
smoke through his nostrils he took his
granddaughters disengaged hand in one
crab reef	
of his laid it on a knee of his tarry breeches
and patted it affectionately
   yell wed her lad he queried stoop-
ing forward and turning the twinkling
glance of his startlingly blue eyes upon pe-
ter griffon
   i-i believe-with reason i trust-
she will do me the honor of-becoming
my wife replied griffon with embarrassed
dignity
  sailor penny chuckled  i have enough
for us all lad he said  ill set ye up
agin in the high place they dragged yer
father down from in the days o the old
king pennyfold be all i want for meself
-an maybe a chair at the dinner table of
high hall
   is your wealth so great my friend
asked griffon  for i doubt if the usurp-
ers will give up those broad lands without
a struggle he added
  i it is great enough and there be a new
king now on the throne aye lad it was
considerable afore the last venture and
now with me own back from caleb stave-
or sufficient to cover interest on it for all
these years anyhow-an the grand treas-
ure that chanced to fall along with an atop
o that we be rich men master peter grif-
fon
   your wealth is no affair of mine ex-
cept so far as your kind and generous
heart may prompt you to befriend me with
it you have already proved a friend in
need and you were my fathers friend
and i would no more question the sources
of your riches than i would weigh your
gold and silver and demand a portion of it
for your sons daughter i know that you
come justly by the strong box of old caleb
stave to which same i pointed you the
way my friend there was justice and if
you had his shop an his ships an all his
household gear to boot twould be no more
than your honest due but what of the
treasure of gold and jewels from fort royal
hill-of the governors fortune
   that too goes into our common purse
lad the giants share o that will be for
yerself an yer lady-my sally there-have
no fear daness ride an high hall an

it was yerself pinted me the way to it
along with the strong box o caleb stave
l but what right have we to the gover-
nors gold and jewels
   what right what right dye say
gods mercy-dye ax me what right the
right o the robbed agin the robber the
right o the weak agin the strong the
only right by which an honest man can
have an hold-aye or keep the blessed
spark o life behind his ribs-in this world
o cheats an thieves an tyrants an slan-
derers an murderers
   nay - say rather the right by which
usurpers now sit in the halls of my fathers
had the jewels belonged to stave well and
good but his theft of them did not make
them his to rob him-yea to bring him
to his death-was justice my temper and
my conscience are with you to the hilt in
that affair but to strip of his fortune a
man with whom you have no quarrel is an
act which i hesitate to call by its true
name to my dead fathers friend
  sailor penny stared at the young man
incredulously for a little while then with
shocked amazement at last with choleric
and sneering disgust the hot blue fire of
his eyes would have daunted a less valiant
fellow than peter griffon he uttered a
string of blistering sea oaths then paused
to note the effect
  griffon continued to eye him calmly the
girl sat with bowed head big tom reclined
on an elbow with his gaze on griffons face
the old man drew a breath and burst forth
again his lips twisting his head and shoul-
ders trembling
   what do i hear he cried  afeared

hardness in his voice  i owe you my

master
  sailor penny screamed oaths at that he
waved his clenched hands above his head
he threatened the girl with a spanking
big tom with a hundred lashes griffon
with everlasting damnation for a fool sud-
denly speechless for want of breath he
burst into tears of rage and disappoint-
ment they looked at him in silence em-
barrassed by their pity and shame for him
he was certainly not a heroic figure that
mahoganv-faced mariner in a tantrum of
futile and lachrymose hysterics
ix
  four days later while there was still a
hint of the past nights coolness in the
morning air three persons arrived from the
jungled mountains at the gate of the gov-
ernors house on fort royal hill they
were peter griffon and big tom and sailor
pennys man henry
  peter wore decent clothes including a
skirted coat and a three-cocked hat and a
hanger with brass hilt and shark-skin grip
in a scabbard of black leather but for
the features and expression of his thin face
the cool superiority of his level glance-
which was the thing that had driven caleb
stave to black rage many a time-and the
carriage of his back and shoulders he might
have passed for the master of some traffick-
ing bark or brig big toms costume was
neither noteworthy nor elaborate - just
breeches cut and stitched up from an old
sail and a floppy hat of his own weaving
the clever henry was in his favorite dis-
guise of an old mammy sweet seller wood-
en tray and all
  they had come with the reluctant con-
sent of sailor penny the old man had
worn himself into a fever with futile rage
and impotent arguments against the iron
of griffons purpose at last he had given
in though with bitter sneers and predic-
tions of disaster what else could he do
this young fool was a griffon of berkshire
and the stubborn girl was a penny and
now all his ambitions and longings were
centered in these two - his dreams and
heartaches for the green downs and groves
of his youth and for peace and gentility in
his old age
crab
reef

  yes that tough and battered survivor of
scores of questionable ventures who had
been half a gentleman in his youth longed
now to become wholly a gentleman by the
might of wealth and the magic of the name
of griffon young griffons will had
beaten him at last and now more than
half his wealth was gone for a surety and
all of it was risked and fever boiled his
blood
   i have business with the governor
said griffon to the sentry at the gate
  the sentry was quite obviously not a
soldier but a seaman he was not armed
with a musket nor with a bayonet heeled
with a wooden plug to fix into the muzzle
of a musket but with a cutlass in his hand
and two pistols in his belt he gave grif-
fon a queer questioning look he turned
his head and whistled and was joined in
a moment by two other fellows of unmis-
takable salty character
   e as business wi the governor he
told them
  then all three regarded griffon and his
companions strangely
   i am here to see the governor on an
important matter announced griffon with
dignity
  another seaman joined the group a
bosun this with a silver call dangling from
his neck on a lanyard he had heard grif-
fons second statement of his business he
treated griffon and big tom and henry to
swift but searching glances he pulled a
forelock to griffon whispered a few words
in the sentrys ear then requested griffon
politely to follow him
  he led the way across a narrow court
into the big house along a narrow hall
flagged with gray stone he rapped on a
tall mahogany door opened it bowed grif-
fon across the threshold and entered close
at his heels he closed the door behind
them but kept a hand on the knob
   a gentleman wi important business wi
the governor sir he said and there was a
suggestion in both voice and manner of
extraordinary significance in the statement
and of lively expectation concerning the
effect of it on the person addressed
  the room was not large but it was of
an imposing height four tall windows in
one wall partially shuttered looked out
over the town and the harbor the room
was unfurnished save for a large table at
which sat a gentleman of red and weath-
ered visage high-nosed baldish with epau-
lets on the shoulders of his blue coat
the gentlemans coat was open from chin
to waist disclosing linen of the whitest
and finest on the desk lay several rolled
charts or maps many documents both open
and folded a bow-wig a silver-hilted sword
in a scabbard of varnished black leather
and a number of books
  the gentlemans glance was on griffons
face it had been there unwavering since
the moment of the opening of the door
   ah with the governor he said and
laid aside his pen and continued to regard
the young man
  griffon bowed  have i the honor to
address the governor he asked
  you do not know him then queried
the other
   i have seen him sir but never close at
hand he looked shorter than yourself
   true i am performing his duties for
the time being i am the commander of
the frigate in the harbor colonel harran
is indisposed you have but recently come
to port i take it
   i am from the hills my business is
private rather than official i think but i
shall gladly dispose of it here and now sir
with your permission
   what is the nature of your business
   it concerns stolen property of great
value
  the acting governors eyes widened
   you are either a very brave man or an
impudent fool he said
   i lack neither courage nor an easy con-
science replied griffon  a fortune in
jewels was robbed from the governor from
this very house by a fellow named stave
a ships chandler who did business in crab-
hole alley stave himself was soon after-
ward robbed of it along with his own strong
box by a worthy fellow who had been out-
lawed and ruined by him many years ago
i have persuaded that worthy fellow to al-
low me to return the jewels to the gover-
nor
  the acting governor was now on his feet

argosy-allstory weekly
leaning forward eagerly halfway across the
littered table
   what are these jewels he asked
   diamonds and pearls and rubies of
astounding value
   and you are come with the intention
of returning them to colonel harran
   as you see sir to him or his deputy
to the governor
  griffon put a hand to his throat pulled
upward on a string and brought a little
bag of soft yellow leather into view he
drew the loop of string over his head
stepped forward to the table and laid the
bag before the acting governor the bosun
advanced with him close at his elbow and
halted with him the acting governor un-
tied the mouth of the bag and shook onto
the table a handful of unset diamonds and
rubies and a necklace of great pearls he
stared at them the fellow at griffons el-
bow trembled
   and those are not all said griffon
producing two more little bags from a
pocket of his coat and emptying them on
the table  there is gold also which is
outside with my fellows
  who are you cried the acting gov-
ernor
   i am peter griffon only son of the late
edward griffon of daness ride and high
hall and griffonstun in berkshire knight
and one time master of the horse
   griffon of berkshire how come you
here-and with these
   it is a long story sir
  during the telling the acting governor
expressed sympathy and astonishment with
frequent oaths and at the conclusion he
the
grasped the younger mans hand in both
of his he called for wine and for another

           what has occurred in part
fannie gillespie a slim blue eyed brown haired girl comes to the great city and eventu-
ally turns her pretty face toward the bright lights as the sunflower to the sun if not as the
moth to the flame her position is that of saleslady in an exclusive shop for womens hats
really an achievement for a country lass but in this environment she is envious of the rich clients
who have diamonds and sables and motor cars fannie in her pathetic rivalry wears imitation
gems and tries to approximate the extreme styles in her cheap clothing a guest in the boarding
house henry jordan a filing cabinet salesman is devoted to her but she becomes indifferent to
him when she learns that he does not care for frivolous things and that his hope is to save money
to marry her fannie cannot endure the thought of domesticity this is her play lime of youth
jordan discloses in a conversation with another boarder that he is in sympathy with any man who
slays the woman who has destroyed his high ideals meanwhile fannie gillespie keeps late hours
at dances and her escorts are of a swift type-a racing car driver a beach amusement conces-
sionaire et cetera she reveals moreover that she is in secret fear of some pursuer and this hint
causes the police to suspect murder and not suicide when the laughter loving girl is found dead
in her room

upon mrs horton the landlady after their
interview she had gone directly to her room
utterly overwhelmed by the added horror
of his implied suggestion in henry jor-
dans large pleasant bedchamber beside
hers the young man himself simeon bar-
ley and the new boarder edgar north
talked together in low subdued tones
mrs moffat was pacing the floor of her
own room at the front and above myrtle
harris tossed in the troubled sleep super-
induced by dr vaughns opiate
  the door of the hall closet on the top
floor stood wide a pale square of light
streaming down into it from the opened
trapdoor and on the roof the detective
stevenson was down upon hands and knees
in the soot and grime minutely studying
the blurred outline which showed here and
there in the thick covering of dust and
cinders
  parallel lines of slender none too clean
rope stretched from pole to pole across the
rooftop except in one space where newly
cut ends hung in loops from opposite up-
rights and clothespins were scattered here
and there
  a package hastily wrapped in a news-
paper lay beside stevenson and he sat back
on his heels taking from it a large and
exceedingly battered shoe with frayed
dangling strings this he proceeded to
iit over the prints he had been examining
in the dust and then shaking his head he
rewrapped the dilapidated footgear and
rising approached one of the posts from
which depended a length of the severed
clothesline detaching it he coiled it tight-
ly and placed it in the package with the
shoe then crossed to the trapdoor and de-
scended closing it carefully after him
  in the big back bedroom on the second
floor simeon darley fully clothed now even
to the tie of gorgeous hue which flowed be-
neath the lowest fold of his chin sat de-
jectedly on the side of the bed his hands
nervously twisting the coverlet and his dull
eyes staring at the floor as though to fix
forever in his mind the faded commonplace
pattern of the rug henry jordan moved
restlessly about rumpling his curly red-
dish brown hair now and then with an im-
patient gesture his haggard face boyish no
longer but stamped with lines of maturity
and suffering while from his position by
the window edgar north glanced in a sym-
pathetic but diffident manner from one to
the other of them
  a little silence had fallen but as he halt-
ed henry jordan broke it
   im going to find out he struck one
hand into the cupped palm of the other
 im going to find out what made her do
it and who it was brought on her whatever
trouble she was in it wasnt any fault of
hers- you didnt know her north but
simmy can tell you that it would be as far
from her to do anything dishonest shed be
afraid to have found out as it would be to
lose her head over some hopeless romantic
affair she just lived for excitement and
the bright lights fascinated her blinded her
to everything else shes got a brother
somewhere but nobody else and as a friend
i mean to get at the truth and make some-
body pay
   i was a friend of hers too simeon re-
minded him shaking his head dolefully
 i was willing to be more than that when
i saw that you-well that you and she
werent going to hit it off after all-but she
would never have married an old fellow like
me and i stopped making more of a fool
of myself than i was born to be theres
nothing i wouldnt have done for her
though and nothing i wont do now but
i cant see why she did such a thing
   of course she didnt do anything dis-
honest henry and as for being in love-
i	dont believe it could ever hit her hard
enough to make her feel that life wasnt
worth living as you say the bright lights
were all that counted
   you met her at dinner last night mr
north-god it doesnt seem possible whats
happened since-and you saw how gay
and high spirited she was would you have
thought she had it in her mind to kill her-
self before morning
  north shook his head gravely
   no suh assuredly not as mr jordan
says i didnt know her but the young lady
appeared to be most happy and full of life
she must of cose have been in some sor-
row or misery but she certainly kept it to
herself right bravely
bright lights

   well it isnt any good for us to keep
milling it over and over simeon rose
wearily the jauntiness of yesterday lost in
a profound depression that made his dash-
ing attire seem all the more incongruous
although his figure seemed pathetic now
rather than droll  i just want you to
know henry that im with you in what-
ever youre going to do to find out if any
one drove that poor child to her death we
owe it to her and as you say she has no-
body else ill go crazy if i dont stop
thinking about it and ive got to get down
to the office somehow later im going to
see if that detective fellow has gone
when the door closed behind him ed-
gar north stepped forward
   im a stranger to you-all but i would
like to help too if there is anything i can
do he offered  the young lady was your
friend and i only met her once but down
where i come from a woman-especially
alone and making her own way-is a kind
of charge for every man to be of service
to there is nothing anybody can do for
miss gillespie now except to reckon with
whoever caused her to suffer just as men-
folks kin to her would do and i hope you-
all will count me in like any neighbor
thats good of you north henry
exclaimed as he met the others resolute
glance  of course if her brother comes
forward to look after the situation it wont
be up to any of us and i have an idea hes
the sort of fellow who would rather let the
whole thing drop and be forgotten than lift
a finger to stir up gossip in his home town
still ill never rest until i know just what
happened last night
  stevenson had not descended from the
top floor but leaving his package beside
the closet door he pushed open the one
which swung on yawning hinges the little
room was flooded with light now for the
shade had been pulled up at the single win-
dow and a veering streak of sunshine played
over the clean neatly mended rug to the
foot of the tall narrow tumbled bed
  its two snowy pillows were piled one on
top of the other and still hollowed in the
center where a restless head had lain upon
them and the coverlet and bedding were
flung back trailing over the square shining
brass footboard a faded pink cotton
kimono lay over a chair from beneath which
a pair of rose colored boudoir slippers
peeped with one rosette gone a box of
chocolates was upset on the floor and a
small crumpled handkerchief had been
dropped near by but there was no other
sign of disorder in the room save the second
chair overturned
  a white celluloid toilet set flanked by
bottles of perfume and jars and boxes of
cosmetics was spread on the bureau top
and a row of high heeled shoes and slippers
for the most part gay hued and paper
soled were ranged along a low shelf from
the bracket of the single gas burner above
it lengths of ribbon dangled the room
contained in addition only a washstand and
a small trunk placed just under the window
but the half open door of the closet revealed
close packed gowns of butterfly coloring
varied by sober black
  the detectives keen darting glance took
in every detail although he had already giv-
en the room a cursory examination and now
he stepped once more to the window and
drew aside the curtain of dotted swiss the
fire escape reached up to the floor below
and a sheer four stories down the cleanly
swept square of the cement yard showed
like a white patch crossed with the straight
threadlike shadows of the clotheslines
stretching from fence to fence the yards
on either side were littered and unkempt
but that directly in the rear sported a grass
plot with a few struggling bushes putting
forth bedraggled buds and from each win-
dow sill with its box of sturdy geraniums
trailing vines descended
  that must be a private residence ste-
venson concluded one of the few remaining
in that section only a stones throw from
broadway which had formerly housed some
of the citys most conservative families
could any one within it have looked from
their rear windows on the previous night
and seen something which might give him
a clew to this problem which to his vision
seemed growing more and more complex
  he turned away at last and approached
the bureau opening one drawer after an-
other to discover in the topmost a confu-
sion of gloves handkerchiefs more ribbons

argosy-allstory weekly
and a dozen dainty accessories to feminine
attire while below cheap lacy underwear
and sleazy silk stockings were all that met
his gaze nowhere did there appear to be
a scrap of paper bearing even an address
much less the picture post cards and notes
which girls of fannie gillespies type usual-
ly treasured
  their absence was in itself significant
and he tried the hatboxes on the shelf in
the closet one contained scraps of lace
and ribbon and another unmended stock-
ings and lingerie but the rest held only the
collection of millinery for which they had
been originally intended the drawer of
the washstand yielded a bottle of ink pens
and a box of lavender tinted note paper
but not a line had been written upon it and
he turned his attention to the trunk
  it was locked but in a leather vanity
case which hung beside the mirror the de-
tective found the key the top tray was
evidently a repository for still more finery
but past its usefulness and stevenson lift-
ed it out placing it across the bed the
bottom of the trunk was littered with the
very souvenirs which he had been seeking-
snapshots and group photographs of the
sort procurable at the various resorts and
amusement parks ribbons from candy boxes
and bunches of violets menus and paper
favors from many restaurants along the
rialto and a collection of horns rattlers
and other noise producing toys which attest-
ed to the girls presence at frequent carni-
vals and holiday festivities
  in all of the photographs fannie gilles-
pie herself was prominently- featured some-
times with a taller dark laughing girl in
company with several youths but more fre-
quently alone with just one young man and
not the same young man except in three in-
stances the detective rapidly sorted them
out in three of the pictures her fellow
boarder henry jordan was posed with her
in half a dozen her companion was a man
slightly older loose limbed and yet with the
unconscious poise of an athlete his nose
was aquiline his lips firm and jaw promi-
nent and a long lock of dark hair strayed
carelessly down over his forehead
  the individual who appeared more nu-
merously than either of the other two with
fannie gillespie in her gallery was in strik-
ing contrast to them slender blond and
almost effeminately dapper his clothes were
obviously custom made and he wore them
with the studied effect of one habituated
to self-exploitation the smug countenance
with its small close clipped mustache and
cleft chin was familiar to stevenson and
he placed him at once as jack rogers a
motion picture actor whom he had seen
more than once on the screen
  to the various young men in the other
photographs he gave only a passing glance
yet tied them all up together with a bit of
violet ribbon and placing them at one side
continued his search
  he had not so far found a scrap of
writing but in a corner of the trunk he
came at last upon a five pound candy box
filled to the brim with letters taking it
out he dropped the trunk lid and seated
himself upon it the letters were for the
most part mere scraps of notes making or
breaking engagements and signed only with
first names they were undated but the
postmarks supplied that deficiency and
showed that they were the collection of
nearly a year back
  several in purple ink on violet note paper
bore the name  eileen a dozen or more
in a large masculine hand with underlines
and broad flourishes were signed  jack
and condescendingly affectionate in tone
addressing the recipient as  girlykins or
 little girl but they were nearly all half
jocular excuses for forgotten or ignored en-
gagements eight or ten notes however
in a plain heavy writing with deep down
strokes were in quite a different tenor be-
ginning invariably  dear fan they re-
proached her for missed appointments cold-
ness and unkindness hinting at flirtations
and fickleness on her part and pleading
humbly for her favor
  later ones as indicated by the post-
marks were more hurt and resentful in tone
-as if the writers patient devotion were
tried beyond endurance-and the final one
mailed some six months before was an im-
passioned if ungrammatical farewell they
were signed  frank
  there were  joes and  dicks a
 bert a  fred and numerous other
bright lights

masculine names attached to various epis-
tles but they appeared to be from mere
admiring acquaintances and of little mo-
ment and the box was almost empty none
of them had been postmarked  bison
nor could they by any stretch of the im-
agination have been written by a brother
and none contained the least reference
which would give a clew to the previous
nights tragedy
  at the very bottom of the box how-
ever were several notes of a few lines
each without envelopes and folded into
small triangles they were written in pen-
cil and half of them were unsigned but at
sight of the name attached to the rest the
detective frowned thoughtfully and gave
himself with complete absorption to their
perusal
  the noon whistles blew and a renewed
stir and bustle throughout the house indi-
cated that the normal routine was being
resumed in spite of the tragedy mrs hor-
ton her eyes still red and a look of shrink-
ing terror stamped upon her face ordered
the days supplies over the telephone in-
stead of venturing to market agnes was
straightening such of the rooms as she could
gain admittance to and mrs moffat was
assisting myrtle harris to dress in the event
that the detective would release her to go to
her work at the motion picture house
  in the drawing-room with the embargo
on tobacco lifted for once simeon darley
and the young southerner had foregathered
again but henry jordan still kept to his
room pacing back and forth as though in-
action were a torture the presence of his
two fellow boarders had been a trial but
he found their absence insupportable and
turned with relief when a knock sounded
upon his door
  it was the detective stevenson
   you wanted to see me there was a
note of surprise in his voice but he added
quickly  oh yes i was the first to enter
the room behind the policeman after he
broke down the door we didnt touch the
-the body it wasnt necessary anybody
could have seen even in the darkness that
it was too late come in wont you
  stevenson entered closing the door but
he did not appear to see the chair which
the young man indicated instead he ad-
vanced to the center table standing with
his back to the light so that his face was
in shadow
   you knew fannie gillespie pretty well
didnt you there was in his manner now
none of the confidential sympathetic note
he had used in his interview with the land-
lady  ever meet her before she came here
to board
  henrv shook his head
   no
   how long was it after you first met
her that you and she became engaged
   we never were henry started slight-
ly and his face flushed  i admired miss
gillespie a lot-
   it wont do the detective interrupted
shortly  you were in love with the
girl
  	yes i was-or at least i thought so
it amounts to the same thing i suppose
henry straightened throwing back his
shoulders and eyed the other steadily
 miss gillespie didnt care for me how-
ever and there was an end to it i dont
see how that matters now or what its got
to do with your investigation
   dont you stevenson came a step
forward and rested his knuckles on the
table  there was an understanding be-
tween you two wasnt there
   not a definite one
    definite enough for you to take it pret-
ty hard when she threw you over a
slow smile grew on the detectives face
l why did she jordan what was the row
about
   miss gillespie didnt  throw me over
as you call it henry retorted hotly
 ive told you that i admired her and
thought for a time that i was in love with
her perhaps i was but i dont see what
business it is of the authorities miss gil-
lespie did  not care enough about me to
marry me and told me so but there wasnt
any  row 
    how long was it after she came here
that you began going around with her
   oh several months she was so popu-
lar and had so many friends that i never
thought there would be a chance for me
and i was taken up with my work it was

argosy-allstory weekly
late in the summer after she came back from
her vacation that i asked her to go to a
band concert with me in the park and from
then on-
  he paused and stevenson finished for
him
   from then on you were sweethearts
even if she didnt care enough about you
to marry you she let you think she did it
was all fixed in your mind at least was it
not
   i had misunderstood miss gillespies
attitude toward me responded henry
stiffly  it was not her fault and the mat-
ter was ended some time ago i dont wish
to discuss it
   fraid youll have to young man
there was a sterner note in the detectives
tone  you and the girl exchanged notes
that didnt go through the mail what did
you do-slip them under her door
   no henry was plainly taken aback
 we put them in the big vase that stands
in the wall niche at the turn of the stairs
just outside here on this floor it all began
only in fun and we didnt do it regu-
larly-
  he stopped for stevenson had taken a
handful of the little triangular folded notes
from his pocket and was slowly opening
them he showed one of the unsigned ones
   is this your writing
  henry nodded
   yes youll find my name on some of
them if miss gillespie kept them all what
of it surely you dont imagine that what
was to her merely a-a flirtation-has any-
thing to do with what happened last
night 
   do you recall the occasion when you
wrote this stevenson had been running
through the notes ignoring his protest and
now he read aloud   dear fannie ive
been thinking over what you said and i
dont see my way clear to taking you to
that masquerade dear im sorry but you
know my circumstances and what im
working for since christmas weve spent
all that i saved in the six months before
and i must call a halt some time be my
own girl and come with me to the skating
rink instead well drop in afterward for a
dance and some ice cream anywhere you
say dont be angry sweetheart we cant
go on this way henry 
   i remember that all right it was just
before st valentines day and miss gil-
lespie wanted to go to a masquerade where
the tickets alone would have been more than
i could afford henry responded a trifle
grimly
   she went though the detective sug-
gested
   with some one else that was the be-
ginning of the break between us but we
stayed good friends i couldnt give her
what she had to have and we both realized
it
   good friends eh how about this
 you cant mean it i wont give you up
i had rather see you dead before me than
belonging to somebody else and you cant
play with me as you have with the others
you have driven me half crazy fannie i
love you so 
   for gods sake whats the good of
going over all that henry groaned
 havent i told you that i was wild about
her and i made a fool of myself dont
you think its bad enough for me to re-
member now without hearing my own
words im not the only fellow thats been
hard hit in his life but its all over and
done with now 
    all over last night stevenson assent-
ed coolly  youd rather have seen her
dead and youve had your wish 
   what do you mean henry demanded
hoarsely
   what did you mean when you wrote
this the detective countered   i un-
derstand you at last i wouldnt let my-
self believe it before i can see now why
some men kill and think the price well
paid to rid the world of some one better
out of it you never cared you dont know
what it is and when i look back and think
what a fool i was and all that i hoped and
planned with you just laughing at me i feel
like killing somebody myself i warn you
you have driven me mad thats pretty
plain jordan but i guess wed like to know
about it a little more definitely you ad-
mit you wrote this the handwriting is yours
you were in love with the girl and she turned
you down you threatened her-
bright
lights

   stop right there henry exclaimed in
a low voice  are you accusing me of-
murder her-her body was found with
the door locked on the inside i was wild
with jealousy and disappointment when i
wrote that but it meant nothing you
dont think that i could have had anything
to do with her death its monstrous
   the door was locked from the inside
but the window was open and there are
marks on the sill stevenson returned sig-
nificantly  the rope that hung her was
strong enough to bear the weight of a man
also if it was let down from the roof where
it was cut from a clothesline i guess youd
better come down town with me jordan
and explain about those letters to the
chief
chapter vi
lockwood steretts opinion
  ll never believe it never mrs hor-
y ton plumped down in the rocker in
mrs moffats room her lips com-
pressed in a straight line and her mild eyes
blazing  when that smart aleck of a
detective first talked to me yesterday he
hinted that-that it wasnt poor fannies
own hands fastened that rope around her
neck but i was so overcome i didnt guess
what he was getting at id like tove died
when he took henry away and why that
boy wont clear himself-
   what did he say to you this morning
when you went down to see him mrs
moffat asked
   he wouldnt even see me the land-
lady shook her head mournfully  i gave
a piece of my mind to that detective
though when he came again its terrible
enough to have that poor dear child dead
to say nothing of her killing herself with-
out henry being accused of murdering her
i dont wonder hes so broke up he dont
know what to do seeing as he used to be
crazy about her i declare i think the
police must be downright fools holding him
like this when they know theyll only have
to let him go
  mrs moffat pursed her lips reflectively
   has he a lawyer
   yes the firm he works for sent him a
big one-lockwood sterett of sterett
hecksher and mullanafey they defended
that girl last year who was accused of shoot-
ing her brother-in-law right in the lobby of
the odeon theater and the jury acquitted
her without leaving their seats i under-
stand henry was hardly willing to see
him i cant make out whats got into that
boy 
   i remember reading about that case it
looks pretty serious doesnt it if its going
to take a lawyer as celebrated as that to
get young mr jordan out of this trouble
mrs moffat observed  the police may
be making out a stronger case against him
than we have any idea of
   oh its only that the firm want him to
have the best mrs horton replied easily
 they think a lot of henry you know he
went right into the factory and learned all
about the steel construction of that furni-
ture from the ground up thats why he can
sell it so well and i shouldnt wonder if he
made his everlasting fortune with that lock
hes inventing i must say its a dreadful
thing to bring such a charge as this against
a fine young man like henry but he aint
the weak kind to let it hurt his whole future
and hell never in the world be held for
trial they couldnt
   he must have been in his room all night
before last mrs moffat spoke as if to
herself  did he go out earlier in the eve-
ning its funny i didnt hear him come
in when his room is just back of this and
im a light sleeper
   i heard him the landlady affirmed
 i wouldnt give that stevenson the satis-
faction of telling him but it was nearly
midnight and he walked the floor for the
longest time afterward i had half a mind
to get up and ask him if he was sick or
anything for he aint usually restless like
that theres the bell do you suppose
its that dratted detective again
  she arose patting her gray hair nervous-
ly and smoothing her voluminous black
skirt and after a brief interval agness
slip-shod feet could be heard scuttling up
the stairs
   mis horton  her watery eyes were
staring and her breath caught in her throat

 who dyou thinks down in the parlor
a man who calls himself  gillespie -mr
william gillespie
  lord amighty mrs horton gasped
 poor fannies brother whatever in the
world am i to say to him
  she bustled out and down the stairs to
find a young man standing by the window
in the parlor he turned as she entered
and came slowly forward a tall awkward
young man in an ill fitting suit of gray
with a wide new mourning band sewed
crookedly on one sleeve and a made-up
black tie about a collar a size too big
through the wings of which his adams ap-
ple moved up and down convulsively
  his prominent eyes were a paler blue
than fannies his features sharper and the
hair slicked down flatly over his low fore-
head was a dull mouse color nevertheless
there was a slight indefinable resemblance
which made the landladys eyes blur and she
impulsively held out both hands
   mr gillespie i was just saying that i
dont know what im going to say to you
nor how i can let you know what i feel
youre a relation of fannie
   im her brother his nasal voice was
flat and unemotional and he shook one of
her hands listlessly  feller from new
york police came up to bison last night
and told me what had happened to her
and my wife thought id better get down
here myself and see what was to be done
i aint heard from fannie in a long time
she didnt leave any word for me did
she
  mrs horton shook her head
   no but she-she often talked about
you to me mr gillespie in her desire to
comfort him she good heartedly stretched
a point yet she felt vaguely with a repelled
sense of frustration that this long faced
solemn young man was not in any pressing
need of it  youre the only relation she
had in the world aint you
   yes but we werent much alike im
steady going but she was all for gay doings
i dont knows i ever expected to hear from
her again and this-this is an awful shock
my wifes on the school board and quite
a worker in our church and its going to
make it pretty hard for her if theres a lot
of scandal we were set against fannie
coming to the city from the first and did
everything we could to stop her but she
was possessed to get here ever since she was
a little thing and this is whats come of it
   ive got a first class shoe store and she
could have clerked it for me or kept the
books but it didnt satisfy her she had to
have new york life well she got it
i shouldnt wonder if i had to shut up store
for a while and take my wife away and
its right in my busy season
  mrs hortons face flushed and her eyes
snapped
   i guess poor fannies suffered moren
anybody else will she remarked  what
did the man that went up to find you tell
you about her
   that shed hung herself  a dull flush
had mounted too in his sharp face and his
jaw set  i dont know any more and i
dont want to she had a good home to
come back to if she was so minded and wed
always have looked out for her no matter
what kind of a muss she got herself into
there wasnt any call for her to do what
she did though my wife always said noth-
ing but harm would come of her leaving
us like that
   fannie was as good and sweet a girl
as ever i had in my house mrs horton
declared indignantly  there wasnt any
harm come to her till-till the night before
last and heaven only knows what that
was they told you she-shed killed her-
self but they aint so sure they didnt
tell you that theyve arrested one of my
boarders on suspicion of knowing something
about her death
  william gillespie shook his head his slow
mind evidently taking in with difficulty the
portent of her words then his flush reced-
ed and his jaw sagged
   murder he mumbled thickly  you
mean they think somebody murdered her
this boarder of yours-what makes
them-
   because he wanted to marry her but i
guess she must have thrown him over not
that theres a single thing against him the
police are only trying to make it out worse
than it is though goodness knows its ter-
rible enough mr gillespie henry jor-
bright lights

dan is a splendid young man and hed never
have harmed a hair of your sisters head
no matter what they say
  gillespie seemed scarcely to have heard
his bony large knuckled hands were open-
ing and closing with a tenseness which made
them tremble and a cold glittering light
had dawned in his pale eyes
  if it was that cords stood out in
his throat and his adams apple bobbed
more convulsively than ever  if fan
didnt do it after all-if somebody killed
her-im glad i come
   nobody knows whether they did or not
but it wasnt henry jordan mrs horton
reiterated hastily  dont you believe that
for a minute mr gillespie fannie hadnt
any reason in the world that any of us can
think of to kill herself but it seems more
impossible still that anybody else could
have done it even if they had cause which
they hadnt folks cant be got up out of
their beds with the gas on bright and-
and hung without struggling or making
some kind of an outcry that could have
been heard for though fannie was the only
one sleeping on that floor the rooms just
below was all occupied and shed locked her
door from the inside
   the police ought to know what theyre
doing gillespies thin lips tightened  i
guess ill get on down to their headquarters
and see what they can tell me i suppose
it  cost a sight of money to prove any-
thing but the state  likely pay it and as
long as theres bound to be scandal it might
as well be proved that fan didivt fly in
the face of providence and kill herself
well be able to hold up our heads any-
way  
   i spose -mrs hortons own lips
curled- i spose if somebody-not henry
-did murder fannie youd just as lief see
em punished for it even if it did make a
little more talk
    i calculate the law  take its course
maam he turned toward the door but
paused on the threshold  were peaceble
law-abiding folks up my way and i dont
aim to go against the police if they say it
was murder theyll take care of who did it
and if it turns out that fannie killed her-
self well just bury her right and try to
live it down it wont bring fan back to
get in more scandal than we be in aready
   im stopping at the witlow hotel if
you should want to reach me but ill be
much obliged if you wont let on to any of
the fellers that write pieces for the papers
my wife wouldnt want me to say anything
ill make all the arrangements for the fu-
neral as soon as the police  give me
leave
   and your sisters things mrs horton
asked in a repressed tone  the police are
holding em now but do you want i should
send em to you
   yes  maple street bison is the ad-
dress i guess likely my wife can find some
use for them he returned promptly then
hesitated  you dont know if there was
any wages coming to her where she worked
do you
  no i dont the disgusted landlady
snapped  i guess maybe you can find out
if you try though
   i calculate i can gillespie nodded
unmoved  did she owe for board or any-
thing else that you know of mrs horton
i dont aim for her to have any debts left
behind her though she was always awful
extravagant
   fannie didnt owe me anything and i
aint heard of her getting in debt she re-
plied with a final effort at self-restraint
 i guess the funeral will be about the only
expense youll be put to mr gillespie and
if you feel that its too much for you ill
be glad to pay it myself as i told the police
seems to me its little enough to do for
her
   im obliged to you maam but it wont
cost much he was impervious to the
shaft  good day to you
  mrs horton did not trust herself to re-
ply to the salutation except by the merest
of nods and when the front door had closed
behind him she started for the stairs but
encountered simeon darley in the hall
   did you hear him she demanded
 that was fannies own brother and all
he cared about was to know if there was
any money due her at the store do you
wonder she got away from home quicks
ever she saved up carfare
  simeon nodded gravely

argosy-allstory weekly
  il i thought hed be like that if he showed
up at all little fannie wouldnt have
dropped her relations if they hadnt been
pretty mean to her i cant get over the
shock about henry though why just a
little before they took him away he told me
and that new young fellow north that he
wouldnt rest until he found out why shed
killed herself that doesnt look as if he
could have had a suspicion it wasnt suicide
let alone that he-he knew anything unless
hes a lot deeper than we ever thought
   why how you talk mr darley mrs
horton exclaimed in amazed reproach
 surely you dont believe-
 i dont know what to think he
shook his head  id never have believed
it of henry myself but the police dont
usually risk making mistakes and theres no
telling what they know
   hes the quiet kind you cant always
make out and he did seem to take fannies
turndown mighty cool considering how
crazy he was about her it seemed kind of
funny to me now that i remember it
dont seem possible knowing the boy as we
do that he could have been planning such
a fearful thing but how are we to judge
what was going on in his mind
   well i can still having what gumption
i w-as born with mrs horton declared
loyally  as to the police not making mis-
takes- there goes the door bell again
if its that gillespie man back i dont
knows ill be responsible for what i may
say to him
  but it was not william gillespie the
gentleman who entered when agnes opened
the door was middle-aged and urbane with
large lensed glasses astride his aristocratic
nose straight smooth shaven lips and a
clean cut fighting jaw the tones in which
he announced his name and errand were low
but they carried to the ears of mrs horton
and her boarder who had discreetly retreat-
ed under the slope of the stairs and the
landlady waddled quickly forward
   mr sterett im mis horton and i
must say im glad to see you come right
in the parlor i heard henry jordans firm
had got you to look out for him in this
trouble and if theres anything i can tell
you ill be very pleased
   thank you the attorney bowed and
placing his hat on the table took the seat
to which she motioned after closing the
door and dropping into her own chair  i
find that my client is too disturbed in mind
at present to confer with me at any length
and there are some details you can readily
give me
   go right ahead and ask me what you
like mrs horton folded her hands  i
want to say first off though that i know
henry didnt have a thing in the world to
do with poor fannie gillespies death i
havent had a minutes doubt of him and
i aint going to no matter what the police
try to saddle him with
   that is gratifying to hear mrs hor-
ton but i may say i had no misgivings as
to your attitude lockwood sterett
smiled genially  we understand each
other perfectly i think and you realize you
will only be helping mr jordan by giving
me your confidence you have had a great
deal of experience with young people
   if twenty years boarding them and
kind of watching over them means any-
thing i should say i had mrs horton
responded with emphasis  i like to have
em round me and they know it and usu-
ally they get to coming to me with their
troubles no harm ever come to any of
em under my roof until the other night
 im sure of that my client tells me
that at one time he was strongly attached
to the unfortunate young girl who is dead
can you tell me how serious in your esti-
mation that attachment was
  he eyed her inquiringly and mrs hor-
tons glance fell
   bout as serious as it could be i guess
for henrys real serious in everything and
i never knew him to bother with any other
girl it come on him slow for fannied
been here several months before he began
to pay her attention but though he got it
real bad he didnt lose his head
   its my opinion he realized she wasnt
the girl for him at the same time she made
up her mind he couldnt give her the kind
of good times and expensive parties she
wanted and he was sensible and strong
enough not to let it get the best of him
thres no denying he cared though
bright lights

   i see the attorney said slowly
 there were others no doubt who were
waiting to give fannie gillespie these good
times
   plenty she was pretty as a picture
and full of life and innocent fun she had
a lot of gentlemen friends who could spend
moren henry not that fannie was what
they call a gold-digger but she was crazy
about the bright lights and she just never
thought what things cost and with auto
racers and motion-picture fellows and men
like them it seems to be easy come and
easy go-
   actors do you mean-and race driv-
ers sterett interrupted  who were
they did you know them
  mrs horton gave their names to the at-
torney and added
   i dont think fannie cared for any-
body at least she never would have killed
herself over any man living thats what
makes it all the more mysterious for she
must have done it herself
   then there was undoubtedly some rea-
son for it and well have to find that rea-
son the attorney remarked quickly
 that will be the first step in refuting the
circumstantial evidence brought against my
client for we cannot establish a corrobo-
rated alibi for that night mr jordan has
already informed the authorities that after
dining he went out alone and walked for
several hours encountering no one he knew
and that on his return he let himself in with
his key and went directly to his room with-
out seeing any other member of the house-
hold
   his rooms right next mine and i
heard him come in if that  help any
mrs horton declared eagerly  he didnt
leave it again either at least not until i
fell asleep and that must have been a good
hour it was twelve or a little before when
he got home
   im afraid that will have little value
sterett shook his head  the autopsy has
shown that the young woman came to her
death some six or seven hours before the
body was found presumably between one
and three in the morning you say that in
your opinion she would never have killed
herself because of a love affair can you
suggest any possible motive for her sui-
cide
   no i cant and the whole things just
about driving me crazy mrs horton
avowed  there wasnt any reason but
neither was there for anybody to murder
her they cant ever fasten it on henry
though thats one comfort how soon do
you suppose theyll let him go mr ster-
ett
   when twelve men on a jury decide that
he is not guilty mrs horton replied ster-
ett very gravely  that they must so de-
cide is a foregone conclusion but we must
not underestimate the strength of the case
against him henry jordan unless further
and contradictory evidence comes to light
will inevitably be indicted and brought to
trial
chapter vii
new light
the attorneys prediction was verified
at general sessions henry jordan
was indicted and held for the grand
jury on a charge of murder in the first de-
gree much to mrs hortons indignation
bail was denied him and as he steadfastly
refused to see any one but his attorney she
was forced to send her messages of cheer
through that obliging gentleman
  fannie gillespies body had been taken
to her former home and her brother came
no more to the boarding house after her
pitiful finery and trinkets were packed and
shipped mrs moffat completed her buy-
ing and returned to ohio simeon darley
with a wondrous array of sport clothes de-
parted upon his vacation and the long hot
summer days passed in a brooding sus-
pense
  edgar north the bond salesman from
new orleans had slipped quietly into the
life of the household and proved to be a
young man of regular if somewhat solitary
habits and unfailing courtesy but he main-
tained a reserve which myrtle harriss
broadest hints for entertainment failed to
penetrate and she gave him up in disgust
  late in june a new boarder made her
appearance-a tall slim quiet-voiced girl

argosy-allstory weekly
with smooth nut-brown hair delicate fea-
tures and deep serious violet-blue eyes
she was one of several under-secretaries to
a prominent banker and mrs horton was
elated at her advent but installed her with
secret misgivings in the large front room
on the top floor xo one had climbed that
last flight of stairs since the tragedy except
agnes on dreaded cleaning days and she
never passed that closed door at the rear
without feeling the scant hair rise on her
head and goose flesh stand out upon her
lean wiry arms caroline the cook had
flatly refused to avail herself further of the
roof for clothes drying purposes vouch-
safing an occult reason in addition to its
grim memories

  mrs horton felt constrained to warn
myrtle harris not to reveal to the new-
comer the details of fannie gillespies death
if she had not read them in the papers but
the precaution was needless for marion
gray herself broached the subject when
they were sitting on the steps of the high
stoop one warm evening after dinner
   it was very sad about the poor girl who
died here last month mrs horton her
tone was filled with a hesitating sympathy
 it must have been a terrible shock to
you all
   shock is no name for it mrs horton
responded feeling a sense of relief that this
latest boarder knew alter all simmy dar-
lev would be home soon from his vacation
and no amount of warning could stop his
garrulous tongue  i thought i should
never get over it miss gray especially
with whats before us when court opens
again but i guess you can stand most
things if you gotta i never had a nicer
girl in my house than poor fannie and
the whole dreadful thing is a mystery to
me mr xorth met her-he come just
the night before it happened-and he can
tell you she didnt act like the thought of
death had ever entered her mind
   xo miss gillespie seemed vey happy
and lighthearted thus appealed to ed-
gar xorth replied in his slow musical
drawl  she impressed me as being a most
charming young lady but of cose i was in
no position to judge her feelings i am not
familiar with the ways of nothem cote
procedure but i cannot help thinking there
may be room fo doubt of the wisdom
shown in the cose taken
   you mean about arresting henry
mrs horton came to the point bluntly
 there wasnt any wisdom about it it was
the most awful piece of-
  she paused for edgar xorth had risen
and stepped aside as a dark pretty girl
hesitated for a moment and then came up
the steps in a little rush with a soft swish
of her silk skirt
   why miss gaffney-
   mrs horton can i see you for a few
minutes i thought perhaps you might
not remember me but-
   of course i do you were poor fan-
nies friend that worked with her at louis-
ettes mrs horton exclaimed as the girl
halted  you used to come here to see
her and i looked for you at the funeral in
the undertaking parlors
   i couldnt go miss gaffney respond-
ed in a low shuddering tone darting an
uneasy confused glance at the other two
from her bold heavy-lashed eyes  ive
been wanting to talk to you though for
ever so long but i couldnt make up my
mind
   come right in the parlor mrs hor-
ton rose and led the way  im awful glad
you come did that brother of fannies
show up at the store
  yes wasnt he awful youd never
think he and fannie- but that isnt what
i came to see you about the girl eyed
the open window cautiously as she seated
herself on the edge of a chair  mrs hor-
ton will you promise never to say a word
if i tell you something the police de-
tectives have been coming to the store and
then the lawyer for that fellow whos been
accused and louisette is wild she
bright
lights

neednt be for the publicity didnt hurt her
with the trade that buys the most only the
old conservative crowd who fuss about a
forty-dollar uncurled ostrich as if it was
a hundred-and-fifty bird of paradise but
she likes their cars in the line in front of
the door and if anybody else comes asking
for me on account of me being such friends
with fannie im afraid ill lose my posi-
tion all the same theres something on
my mind that ive got to tell and i dont
know who else to go to youll keep it to
yourself
   something you know that nobody else
does mrs horton asked eagerly  i
cant help fannie now nor hurt her either
to have anything known but if its about
henry jordan if it  make a difference
in his trial whats the good of telling me
when it isnt to go any further
   oh i dont know what to do miss
gaffney twisted the wrist cords of her van-
ity case with nervous fingers  it isnt
about mr jordan though it might make
a-a big difference i met him when fan-
nie was going around with him and i
thought she was silly to waste her time
with a tight-wad like that who wasnt any
fun when there were heaps of just dandy
boys waiting to show us wonderful times
and take us out right
   she did have sense enough after a while
to break with him but even though he did
take it awful bad and act as if shed done
something terrible i cant bring myself to
think it was him killed her if anybody did
not after the things she told me you
dont believe theres a-a possible chance
that theyll convict him just because of
those letters do you mrs horton
   i didnt believe they could hold him
for trial but they did the landlady re-
plied grimly  if men whose business it is
to judge murderers could take such a stand
theres no telling what a fool jury will do
if you know anything that  help him
even though he wasnt the kind to throw
his money away on good times that didnt
mean anything to a regular man and you
dont come forward and tell it it  be on
your conscience the rest of your life pro-
viding youve got one
   you neednt be mean to me  the girl
sniffed  ive got to think of myself too
havent i id never get taken on in a
swell place like louisettes again with more
notoriety and it isnt as if i really knew
anything only what fannie was afraid of
im afraid too if frank black knew id
talked about him-
   that auto racing feller mrs horton
interrupted  so fannie was scared after
all and it wasnt of what henry might do
i spose you know youll likely be called at
the trial anyway louisette cant blame
you for that
   not if i-i just dont know anything 
miss gaffney faltered
   but youll be under oath and youve
got to tell the truth the older woman
laid a plump hand on the girls knee  mr
steretts been after you already you say
now spose you was to go to him with me
and tell him everything leaving him to md
out the truth without ever letting on the
tip come from you if you aint thinking
about doing right by henry dont you feel
you kind of owe it to fannie mr sterett
wont let this black feller or anybody else
make trouble for you and it  save you
maybe from telling lies in court that you
could go to jail for yourself if it was proved
on you
  miss gaffney cowered in her chair
oh its terrible she moaned if
you think mr sterett wouldnt ever give
me away-
  twenty minutes later mrs horton in
her best black-beaded dress and a top-
heavy bonnet towed the reluctant witness
determinedly into the attorneys luxurious
library and explained the situation lock-
wood sterett had been covertly amused at
her somewhat incoherent telephone mes-
sage but he grew quickly serious when its
purport was revealed
  motioning suavely to chairs he addressed
himself with convincing reassurance to ei-
leen gaffney
   my dear young lady no one shall ever
know we have had this little conference
you were wise in coming to me for i shall
be prepared to shield you from awkward
questioning at the trial you were fannie
gillespies closest friend and she naturally
confided in you am i to understand that

argosy-allstory weekly
she was in fear of her life and from some
one other than my client
  eileen gaffney nodded
   i dont know that she thought frank
black would actually kill her but she was
afraid of him shed treated him the same
way she did mr jordan and other fellows
besides only he wasnt the kind to-to take
a throw without coming back he had an
awful temper fannie told me once that
hed half killed another driver because he
thought hed done something crooked to
him in a road race and he didnt do it
openly either he waited for another race
and then purposely ran him off a bridge
i dont know of course only what fannie
told me
   i understand sterett interposed with
a nod  go on when did fannie gil-
lespie-er throw him
   last summer she knew him a long
time before ever she came to louisettes
where her and me got to be friends and
he was just crazy about her-more than
mr jordan i guess anyway he showed
it more he was a grand spender and he
used to get a friend for me and take us
out for elegant parties with a car of his
own and everything
  eileen waxed enthusiastic then her
pretty face clouded and she shrugged
 he got going too strong though and
wanted fannie to marry him and right
then he was cold with her she canned
him and took up with mr jordan and
frank just faded i warned her he
wouldnt take it like that and i was right
for he was only waiting hed sized up mr
jordan and knew just about how long fan-
nie would stand for free lectures and cheap
movies when shed been used to swell times
sure enough she turned mr jordan down
in february or march and as soon as he
saw her around in the big places again with
jack rogers and ben newell and the
crowd frank came back
   you mean that fannie gillespie ac-
cepted his attentions again the attorney
asked
    she did that all right eileen giggled
then her face grew very sober  fannie
was willing for all the good times hed give
her but she told him flat she wasnt going
to have any more love nonsense she was
off that its funny that a fellowll never
get that through his head if he dont want
to believe it frank didnt he was more
determined to marry her this time than be-
fore and at last fannie got to be a little
afraid of him
   she told you so steretts eyes nar-
rowed behind their wide rimmed glasses
 when did this happen what did she
say
   it was about a month before-before
she died eileens rather shrill tones had
lowered  shed been going out with a
lot of fellows and frank was getting sore
about it one morning at the store she
told me she had had an awful fight with
him the night before and he said hed fix
her so nobody else would want to go out
with her
   i asked her what he meant and she
kind of shivered and said maybe hed throw
vitriol at her or smash her up in his car
or something that hed looked like mur-
der it was then she told me about the
other driver hed crippled but the next
minute she was laughing and said he
wouldnt ever dare do anything to her but
i watched and from then on she was dif-
ferent she wouldnt talk about it but she
was nervous and unhappy when she was
going out with him i asked her why she
went and she said she had to kid him
along til he left for detroit and then she
wouldnt bother with him any more
   when did frank black go to detroit
it was the night before her body was dis-
covered wasnt it
   no he was supposed to go then but
he didnt her voice was a mere whisper
now  fannie didnt tell me she didnt
know and besides i didnt see her again
after she went home from the store that
afternoon shed been acting more and
more nervous and a few days before she
admitted to me at last that she was afraid
of him it was the first time any fellow
had ever made her feel that way but she
knew something dreadful would happen
before she got rid of him and she wished
from the bottom of her heart shed never
laid eyes on him
   you are sure of that mr sterett
bright lights

tapped his desk thoughtfully  you are
positive those were her words
   every one eileen declared  thered
been another quarrel for she was getting so
scared of him she had told him a story
about some date or other just as if he had
a right to know where she was going or
who with and he caught her he said she
ought to have that lie choked back down
her throat and if she didnt promise to lay
off of everybody while he was away shed
never go out with anybody again i was
afraid for her because none of my gentle-
men friends would go that far and i
begged her not to see him any more
but she said she had to for the last time
that last time was the night before she
died and it was somebody else told me
what happened but id rather not say
who-
   never mind that now what was it
sterett leaned forward  do you mean
about the scene in the jazzway restaurant
when rogers came to the table
  eileen flushed and hesitated
   that wasnt all she said at last
 maybe you heard jack was working in a
new picture well they laid him off and
put some one else in his part he dont get
very big ones yet it was so easy but i guess
maybe if you found out why he didnt go on
with it-i couldnt tell you only somebody
said hed met with a kind of an acci-
dent-
   i see sterett nodded  he went
away from the restaurant after the
scene leaving fannie gillespie and black
together there didnt he
   i dont know where he went eileen
disclaimed hastily  i heard fannie ran
off herself and left frank sitting there alone
and he seemed to be in a terrible rage real
late when he was supposed to be on the
train going to detroit somebody i know
saw him in gil fays that place where all
the sporting men go and when they asked
him why he was still in town he said hed
waited over because there was something
he had to tend to and he said it in a nasty
kind of way
   i-i was told he did take an early train
next morning but you could find that out
mr sterett maybe you could find out too
where he was during the time between i
dont mean that any of my friends know
or told me but it seemed to me somebody
ought to just make sure it was him fannie
was afraid of not mr jordan
   she told you all about her affair with
henry jordan sterett changed his line of
inquiry abruptly
   oh yes fannie told me everything i
guess eileens tone was buoyant with re-
lief and she chatted on i never could
understand what she saw in him but per-
haps it was just because he was new and
then hed passed her up for some months
there at mrs hortons as if he didnt know
she was alive and fannie wasnt used to
that i shouldnt wonder if she made up
her mind for fun to get him going and then
fell for him herself for a while
   you knew what they eventually quar-
reled over the attorney pursued
   because he- eileen glanced at mrs
horton and quickly amended her reply
 because she was lively and liked parties
and he didnt she was crazy about danc-
ing not just sitting around holding hands
and she got tired i guess i knew about
those notes he wrote her-she used to show
them to me and wed laugh over them i
mean he was so preachy and fault-finding
as if she was married to him already when
that was the last thing she was thinking
of still i couldnt keep quiet and let him
face this when i knew about frank black
id be scared something terrible to have
him know i said it but if any one broke in
her room that night and killed fannie it
was him
chapter viii
arraigned
mrs horton settled herself firmly
in her chair and gazed about the
crowded court room with a grimly
critical eye mrs moffat who had returned
for the winter stock of ladies and misses
attire for feingolds emporium was seated
beside her and a few rows behind simeon
darley folded his new fawn colored topcoat
carefully over his plump knees and solemnly
regarded the judge

argosy-allstory weekly
  the jury had been selected with expedi-
tion and mrs horton nudged her compan-
ion
   i dont think much of that foremans
looks she observed  i never thought
that a little man with a chin like that had
much mind of his own and you heard him
say he considered circumstantial evidence
as goods any other  cant figger why mr
sterett accepted him
   hes married and got a son mrs mof-
fat whispered back shrewdly  in human
nature hell put his boy in henry jordans
place it would be different if he had daugh-
ters hush
  the district attorney had risen to ad-
dress the jury and at his first crisply
enunciated words mrs moffat glanced at
the prisoner henry jordan was thinner and
pallid but it was not that which had drawn
her attention repeatedly since his entrance
it was the look of stern maturity which
these weeks of suspense had graven on his
features robbing them of their last at-
tribute of youth
  she could scarcely believe that the man
before her embittered by this ordeal and
worn with suffering was the ambitious
buoyant lad of a few short months before
whom disappointment and the shattering of
his fondest illusion had failed utterly to
cast down he appeared weary with a
curious air of detachment as if he were
merely a bored spectator instead of the
central figure in this portentous scene
where freedom perhaps life itself depended
on the decision of the twelve individuals
before him cast in such vastly dissimilar
molds
  but district attorney harkers trenchant
voice claimed mrs moffats ear at length
with a due regard for the dramatic he was
extolling the beauty and virtues of the dead
girl picturing her as a simple little country
maid working industriously to earn her liv-
ing and unmindful of her charm
  pursued by the attentions of her fellow
boarder who had conceived a blind infatua-
tion for her she had at first consented to
give him her companionship out of pity for
the affection which she could not return
but when he demanded too much when he
insisted accompanying his unwarranted
claims by threats-as should be proven in
good time to the gentlemen of the jury-
when he attempted to coerce her into be-
coming his wife linking her whole future
with that of a man she did not love then
frances gillespie gently compassionately
but firmly refused to make this stupendous
absurd sacrifice
  with her refusal revenge entered the
heart of the man seated before them and
he resolved to take her life that no other
might ever find happiness with her he de-
scribed the supposititious murder with a
wealth of graphic detail and wound up with
a peroration painting henry jordan in the
most lurid colors and approximately liken-
ing him to the monsters of history
  when he had taken his seat mrs moffat
felt her eyes drawn yet again to the pris-
oner he seemed scarcely to have heard
the denunciation as he sat staring straight
before him with an odd tightening of the
lines about his set mouth that might almost
have been a shadow of a smile all at once
memory carried her back to the night of her
arrival in the previous spring when he hed
taken her to that sensational screen drama
of faithless love and murder and afterward
defended or at least excused the slayer
with startling distinctness his very words
came again to her mind  maybe he
thought he had a right to kill her same
as hed throttle a wild beast if he had noth-
ing else to kill it with but his bare hands
to keep it from harming other people as it
had him  i believe theres apt to come
a time in any mans life when hed like to
kill
  had he been perhaps unconsciously
voicing his own sentiments was the
thought already in his mind to take fan-
nies life not as the prosecutor declared
to prevent another from happiness with her
but as he himself had said of the pictured
character xot for his own satisfaction
but because he had a right it would be
better if she were were dead
  but even as his words had returned to
cast a first faint shadow of doubt upon
him in her thoughts so the look in his eyes
as for the moment he turned his head to-
ward her dispelled it deeply encircled and
drawn with mental anguish thev were yet
	a 
bright lights

clear and steady with no hint of fear or
guilt in their calm courageous glance
this boy could never even in thought have
committed the hideous crime with which he
was charged
  lockwood sterett had risen in his turn
and with consummate skill to avoid a seem-
ing disparagement of the dead girl he man-
aged to draw a subtly different picture of
fannie as a born coquette instinctively
aware of her attractions and rapacious for
admiration careless of the suffering she
caused if by her blandishments she could
command the entertainment her pleasure
loving nature craved
  in sharp but apparently undesigned con-
trast he described his client as a boy who
worked his way through school while other
lads played who as youth and man had
borne an unblemished reputation com-
manding the respect and admiration of em-
ployers and associates alike ambitious but
conscientious honorable and god-fearing
he touched on the grave responsibility
resting on the gentlemen of the jury when
a mans life himg in the scales of their
judgment pointed to the pitfalls of cir-
cumstantial evidence and assured them
earnestly that he defense would refute con-
clusively the suggestion of their clients
guilt
  with a nice regard for the power and
emphasis of brevity sterett seated himself
again beside his associates giving no hint
to the prosecution as to the line he pro-
posed to take in vindicating the accused
and the real proceedings opened when offi-
cer burke was called to the stand
  after the usual preliminaries the district
attorney asked
   where were you at seven thirty-five on
the morning of may  last
   near the corner of nint avenoo and
forty-eight street patrolling my beat
the policeman answered promptly in the
singsong accents of an oft-told story
   describe what occurred then
   a woman came running up behind and
grabbed me by the aim twas agnes
thats been chambermaid and waitress for
mrs horton at no a since before ever
i was detailed to that precinct she was
white as a sheet with a wild look in her
    a
eyes and says she  come quick mr
burke theres something wrong  and
what is it says i coming along just the
same  i dont know but miss gillespies
door has got to be broke down tis locked
from the inside and she dont answer
   you hear the like of that from rooming
houses more times than a few and i took
it on the double-quick her trailing after
when we got to a the door was open
and a young man id not seen before dash-
ing down the steps he yelled something
about  dr vaughn and i let him go
slamming the door and hurrying on up the
stairs to the top floor meeting no one on
the way but caroline the cook hollering
in the hall mrs horton and another
woman was holding on to each other on
the top step of the last flight and henry
jordan with no coat nor collar on him was
leaning over the rail in the upper hall
  he paused for a little stir had run
around the court room at his mention of
the prisoners name but the prosecutor car-
ried him on
   you know these people
   yes sir all but the lady with mrs
horton and her id seen there off and on
for years back i asked mrs horton what
was wrong and she said nothing just point-
ed to the door of the little hall room at the
rear it was locked all right with the key
turned in it from the other side so i broke
it down taking myself in with it
   twas dark for though the window was
open the shades had been pulled all the
way down but after a minute i made out a
girl in a long white nightgown hanging by
a rope from the high brass bedpost it was
fannie gillespie that i knew well having
seen her come and go from mrs hortons
for more than a year past
  he described mrs hortons collapse the
return of the young man with the neighbor-
ing doctor his own orders and message to
the precinct station while spectators and
jury alike listened with absorbed attention
the defense had no questions to ask and
he was excused giving place to agnes
  the new witness was plainly nervous but
her sharp features bore a determined expres-
sion and she eyed the district attorney mu-
tinously

argosy-allstory weekly
  after drawing from her a corroboration
of the policemans testimony he asked
 youd waited on miss gillespie at the
table and taken care of her room since she
came to board at mrs hortons
    yes sir
   you also had charge of her mail and
answered the telephone calls which came
for her
   i did she had lots of both and my
hands were full remembering the things to
tell one gentleman and another agness
nasal tones had quickened as though she
feared an interruption but the prosecutor
countered smoothly
   miss gillespie was popular you
mean
  sterett made a show of objection but
agnes was permitted to reply
   shed always followers dangling after
her and kept them going real smart and
clever
  it would have been impossible to tell
from her tone whether she intended to
convey admiration or censure but the point
told and the district attorney went on
hastily
 miss gillespie confided in you then
 ive eyes in my head agnes retorted
while a faint titter ran through the crowd
of spectators  there was no need of her
telling me things
  the judge rebuked her sternly and then
the prosecutor asked
   then did you observe when the prisoner
at the bar began paying marked attention
to fannie gillespie
  there was no objection from the defense
and agnes nodded
   yes sir shed been making eyes at
him for months but he couldnt see her
then all of a sudden he started taking her
around and it was all up with him
  the tenor of her reply was unmistakable
now and a wrangle ensued to have it strick-
en from the records but it had registered
and when the prosecutor strove to establish
personal animosity on agness part toward
the dead girl he signally failed without
pursuing the subject of her observations
further he turned her over to the defense
contenting himself with repeated objections
while sterett adroitly drew from her a re-
cital of fannies fickleness and love of finery
and excitement as well as a wholehearted
tribute to her beauty and charm that erased
the impression of partiality she left the
stand a distinct feather in the cap of the
defense and dr vaughn was sworn in
  he recapitulated the incidents of the
morning when the tragedy was discovered
detailing the obvious cause of death and
approximate hour at which it had taken
place and then sterett took him in hand
   doctor have you ever in your profes-
sional capacity encountered a death by
hanging before
   yes two of them in fact the doc-
tor stroked his neatly clipped beard with
flexible tapering fingers
   were they suicides or murders
  the district attorneys instant objection
was overruled and dr vaughn responded
 suicides unquestionably no doubt
was entertained in either case
   in your professional capacity then do
you consider it likely or unlikely possible
or impossible that a person could be forci-
bly taken from their bed and hanged with-
out the least disturbance or outcry which
would reach some ears in a quiet sleeping
household
  this time the roar of objection was sus-
tained but the seed had been planted and
as ihe occupants of the jury box glanced
inadvertently at one another mrs horton
nudged her neighbor again
   get that mis moffat fighting right
from the start aint he i guess there wont
much pass by him
  mrs moffat nodded with her finger on
her lips she had lost the next name called
but the stocky thickset sandy haired figure
which mounted the stand was one she re-
membered it was the detective from head-
quarters lieutenant stevenson
   the spectators too evidently recalled his
prominence in the investigation when the
case first reached the press for a repressed
murmur passed among them like a sibilant
breeze subsiding as the prosecutor began
his questioning
  the detective described his examination
of the room in which the girl had died and
his discovery of the compromising letters
which were submitted in evidence without
bright
lights

protest from the defense after whetting
the curiosity of the jury the district at-
torney craftily left it unsatisfied and
switched the topic to stevensons interview
with the landlady her admission that she
could conceive no motive for suicide on
fannie gillespies part her tribute to the
girls high moral character and general pop-
ularity and account of her growing nervous-
ness during the final weeks of her life cul-
minating in the appearance of fear
  mrs hortons broad face flushed and she
compressed her lips when she heard herself
quoted in the testimony but the reference
was soon concluded and led by the prose-
cutor stevenson told of his survey of the
roof introducing in evidence also the rope
which had suspended the body of fannie
gillespie and the section of clothesline from
which it had been severed
   did you observe anything else on the
roof district attorney harker asked
   yes sir footprints replied the de-
tective promptly
   were they the footprints of a man or a
woman
   a woman
   will you tell the court lieutenant
stevenson how you came to this conclu-
sion
   i found the shoe that had made them
and proved its ownership
  there was a sudden stir far back among
the spectators and caroline resplendent in
a bright purple gown and feathered hat
started to rise from her chair but feeling
curious alien eyes upon her she subsided
   do you recognize this shoe the
prosecutor held up the large but dilapidated
specimen of footwear which the witness had
used in his investigation and the latter
nodded
   yes thats the one i found it with its
mate down in the back yard of mrs hor-
tons house and agnes said it belonged to
the cook and that she wore them hanging
out wash there and on the roof i took
it up to the roof and found it fitted per-
fectly into the prints the only prints
there
  a low mutter came from the indignant
owner of the shoe but it was lost in the dis-
trict attorneys next question
   were there any further indications on
the roof
   none that i saw i went from there
down to the room in which the bodv was
found
  he continued describing its furnishings
and the clothing and toilet articles with
the most minute detail as well as the con-
tents of the trunk when he came to the
photographs they were admitted in evidence
and at length the subject of the letters was
broached again with telling effect the
prosecutor quoted from them reading aloud
to the jury the most damaging passages
written by henry jordan in the first bitter
moments of his disillusionment and al-
though there was little outward manifesta-
tion of it the veering attitude of the men
in the box could be almost felt to mrs-
hortons bewildered disapproval lockwood
sterett interposed no objection until steven-
sons account of his examination of the ac-
cused man
  then his protests came thick and fast
but they were of little avail henry jor-
dan had admitted his infatuation for fan-
nie gillespie but only when he saw that de-
nial would be useless he had been confused
when the notes were produced but con-
fessed having written them declaring that
he had been  wild with jealousy and dis-
appointment he asked if he were being
accused of her murder before the suggestion
of it was made to him and did not deny it
merely reminding his questioner that the
girls door had been found locked on the
inside a trifling and irrelevant detail when
entrance could have been as easily gained
through the window
  in his ensuing examination of the wit-
ness sterett tried by every artifice to amend
his former testimony so as to mitigate its
damning force but stevenson was wary and
not to be shaken and as he left the stand
it was apparent that the prosecution had
indeed scored
  then a name was called at which the lis-
teners gazed questioningly at one another
and mrs horton grasped the arm of the
buyer from ohio in troubled amazement
   evelyn trimble
  a pale angular woman with smooth
bands of fair hair under her plain hat re-

argosy-allstory weekly
peated the oath in a calm low voice which
penetrated to the uttermost corner of the
great room
   what is your profession miss trim-
 ble the district attorney queried with
 urbane courtesy
   i am a graduate nurse
   what in the world- mrs horton be-
 gan but mrs moffat silenced her
   were you actively employed on the
 nineteenth and twentieth of last may
   yes sir from the first to the twenty-
 eighth on a pneumonia case
   where
  at no -b west forty-seventh
street the reply came with quiet pre-
cision but the effect on several of her hear-
ers was significant
   thats just back of us mrs horton
 exclaimed in an irrepressible whisper
  what on earth can she know
   were you on day or night duty miss
 trimble
   night duty sir my hours were from
 eight to eight
   where was your patients room lo-
 cated the prosecutors tone were bland
   on the third floor at the rear of the
 house a private bath adjoined also look-
 ing out on the rear
   the view from the windows of your
 patients room and that of the bath was of
 the back yards
   and the backs of the houses on the
 south side of forty-eighth street miss
 trimble nodded and added  the rear of
 no -a was directly opposite
  the purport of the questioning was ap-
 parent now to the spectators and again they
 stirred expectantly but the district attorney
 continued without pause
   were you in the habit of glancing from
 these windows
   occasionally when my patient did not
 require my attention
   did you notice any particular window
more than others
   yes the single one on the extreme
right of the top floor of no -a-my
right as i faced it i mean the witness
explained  i was curious about it for
there was a light there almost constantly
 did you observe it on the night of the
th and th of last may
   i did the window was open but the
white shade was drawn and the light on
at eight oclock when i came on duty at
nine when i gave my patient a stimulant
i noticed from the bathroom where i rinsed
the spoon that the light was out in the room
opposite but at eleven when i administered
an opiate it had been turned on again and
a figure was plainly outlined against the
shade miss trimble paused and added
 it was that of a woman in profile with
both arms raised removing her hat a small
woman very slender and girlish i had
seen it nearly every evening in that room
since i went on the case
   please tell the gentlemen of the jury
if you noted anything else that night
   nothing for more than two hours my
patient was restless and demanded my at-
tention constantly but at twenty minutes
past one i went into the bathroom once
more to heat some milk i remember the
time because i noted it on my chart the
milk bottle was in a small ice chest under
the window and as i removed it i glanced
out and up to that opposite window at
that instant the light there was extin-
guished
   did you consider that worthy of note
 yes because the light was frequently
out until that hour or even later but from
whatever time it was lighted when the eve-
ning was far advanced until morning be-
tween seven and eight oclock that light was
always there it was never put out never
on one single night
 to be continued next week

 charles alden seltzer
has written his greatest story this is a sweeping assertion but is not
beyond the bounds of truth as you will agree when you read it in
this magazine watch for announcement of opening date
by robert terry shannon
vincente ales and ro awoke
without apparent reason and
opened his eyes to the dim furnish-
ings of his great bedroom his mind be-
gan to clear slowly and he realized that
somehow he had pulled his consciousness
up out of an abysmal black void his
body which lay like a fragile husk under
the light linen and silk coversof his mam-
moth bed of carved walnut was peculiarly
without sensation as though it were in some
way detached from his real being his
arm when he tried to lift it was inert and
heavy with an effort he pulled up a hand
under the covers and felt at his breast for
the pulsation of his heart he was unable
to detect any beat
   this then said vincente alesandro
to himself  is death i am still alive but
i am dying exactly as it was explained
the heart like an engine without power
is slowing down to a final stop
  the darkness like an enveloping cloud
began to gather about his mind but the will
to live a little longer stayed the man from
sinking supinely into cushioned nothing-
ness that represented death there was no
terror no regret-if anything there was
satisfaction his physician who was a
medical celebrity had told vincente ale-
sandro exactly what to expect acting ac-
cordingly the man had done the things
necessary to wind up his life in the manner
which would give him the most satisfac-
tion the act of dying would be his last
master stroke it would represent his sub-
tlest achievement there was no sting now
in the thought of death-and yet-
  vincente alesandro summoned mental
energy from some inner center and drew
himself out of the shadowed borderland
intellectually he was quite ready to go
but the instinctive will of the animal
brought him up as from a great depth-
brought him up fighting physically the
struggle was accompanied by a kind of
friction an increasing illumination a
sharpening of his faculties


argosy-allstory weekly
   like a candle flaming up before it is
extinguished he told himself
  his dark deep-set eyes roved the fa-
miliar room with its heavy carved furni-
ture its paintings and hangings vincente
alesandro had slept in the room for twenty
years since he had built the house when
he was in the full flush of his middle age
and now he was withered like a tree with-
out sap
  beside his bed was a narrow table of
polished wood reaching out he touched
the base of a small parchment shaded
lamp and the room was softly illumined
with a subdued glow on an oval of ivory
banded with a fretwork of silver was the
miniature portrait of a woman young
blond and exquisite turning his head
slightly vincente alesandro regarded it
with eyes that grew into bright triumphant
slits
  suddenly his glance leaped away toward
the long brocaded portieres that separated
the room from the one adjoining which was
his study
   whos there he demanded in a voice
brittle and alert
  no one answered his attention sharp-
ened to a keen nervous edge he was taut
as a drawn wire a renewed current of
energy ran through his nerves  who is
it he called sharply  i saw that cur-
tain move-i heard some one breathe
  again silence craftily the hand and
arm of vincente alesandro reached out to
the end of the table that was nearest his
bed following his fingers a smooth draw-
er slid out and he possessed himself of a
short glistening revolver
    i have a pistol pointed directly at that
curtain-come out or ill fire he said
with dry nerveless composure
  the curtain moved almost imperceptibly
there was now unmistakably the sound
of some one breathing
   at once-or i fire
  the curtain defiantly was brushed aside
and there stepped into the room the slender
darkly clad figure of a man-a lean-faced
man with a sharp protruding under jaw
and thin lips askew with chagrin or per-
haps desperation
   well queried alesandro
  the other tossed his head with a touch
of bravado
   all right-call somebody-send for the
cops he enunciated in a strained voice
 you got me aint you
  vincente alesandro was on one elbow
holding his weapon steadily  who are
you-what do you want
   most of all i want to get away but
i guess there aint a chance as long as
youre pointin that gun at my head
alesandro watched the man with a cat-
like smile developing slowly  youre not
much of a burglar young man he said
with a false note of humor  you ought
to wear a mask and a cap and you most
certainly ought to avoid capture by a bed-
ridden invalid
  the intruder stood motionless pallid
   you can call your cop he said tense-
ly  i aint carryin no weapons an i
aint took nothin away from your house
the worst you can stick me for is unlawful
entry and maybe not that maybe im
just a shell-shocked veteran that wandered
into the wrong place
  for a moment alesandro regarded his
captive steadily with keen searching eyes
slowly he lowered the pistol and waved
the other to a heavy chair near the foot
of the bed the hand that held the weapon
lay lightly but alertly on the bed
   you neednt trouble to start framing
up an alibi he said mockingly  i can
see that youre feeling pretty sick at your
stomach right now but you might as well
get over that you have stumbled into
the only house in new york city where
you would be welcome
  the man sank slowly into the designated
chair removed the soft felt hat he was
wearing and held it on his lap in the
faint light there was an almost vicious
handsomeness in his sharply cut features
surmounted by a crop of crisp black hair
his gray eyes were perfectly steady now
as though he had obtained a fresh grip on
his nerves
   well whats the big idea he asked
coolly yet with something baffled in his
tone
   youve a hard nerve alesandro re-
marked
the devils jest

   maybe the other admitted
   and youve got a pretty big opinion
of your own qualifications-vanity too
bad you havent intelligence as well were
pretty much alike you and i-except in
the matter of intelligence the difference
is in degree not kind i probably have
twice as much nerve-and vanity thats
why im talking so much-vanity ive
been forced to keep it under cover for
years but the necessity no longer exists
im free now from all restrictions you
see your providential coming has caught
me in a rare mood i was preparing to
die when i discovered you ill probably
be dead before you leave the room
  vincente alesandro had been speaking
with a studied leisurely enjoyment his
eyes glistened in his veins his latin blood
was pulsing warmly at a dramatic situation
the role of the bizarre imperturbable ele-
gante-even at the hour of death-reached
a theatric strain in his nature the grow-
ing bewilderment written on the features
of the man before him gave an added fillip
to his pleasure
   let me tell you something my friend
he went on smoothly  i suppose this sit-
uation into which you have stumbled is
without a parallel in the annals of burglary
you saw that the house was darkened you
thought naturally that it was empty-
  the burglar nodded the tenseness was
getting out of his body and his nerves his
eyes gave steady attention to the leathery
face of alesandro
   and you found the master of the house
unexpectedly at home unexpectedly you
were captured again the unexpected-i
vincente alesandro am perhaps the only
man in new york who wouldnt have shot
you or turned you over to the police
there is a brainless type of mind that as-
serts that all men are molded out of the
same primeval mud-that they are all the
same under the skin dolts im not like
any one now living im a throwback
im one of the doges perhaps a reincarna-
tion of one of the dukes of venice or flor-
ence i feel like one but the chances are
that you dont understand a word of what
im getting at-youre just wondering what
your chances are of getting away
  the other smiled faintly  im figurin
on that all right he admitted frankly
 but your drift maybe aint as much
over my head as you suppose
   i hope not alesandro told him coldly
 but the chances are that you think im
insane whereas i am perfectly lucid in my
mind just at the moment of my death
a mysterious fate sends in a man like you
to hear my deathbed confession it is most
gratifying these last confessions you
know are never given to clear a conscience
theyre all the result of vanity-nothing
more i should have hated to die without
the pleasure of confessing the whole
thing is such a beautiful jest
   i told you this situation is without a
parallel and so it is for the first time
in the history of man the thief and his
victim meet without any conflict of interest
i am dying these things in this house
which you came to steal-i cannot carry
them with me a dead man cannot own
property the minute my heart stops i
cease to have any connection whatever with
any earthly possessions i shall be in a
different medium where the material things
of this life are without value perhaps at
the outside i shall live an hour longer
these things are of no possible use to me
in that short space of time therefore in
taking anything you may choose you are
working no hardship upon me you are
depriving me of nothing that i need when
you leave this house i have not the faintest
interest in what you take with you you
may take anything you like
  alesandro paused with a saturnine smile
at the foot of the bed the burglar was
studying him with a puzzled frown the
hands that had hitherto lain motionless in
his lap began now to move restlessly
   if you feel that way about it mister
he said suddenly  an if you aint holdin
no grudge against me-why id just as
soon clear cut right now i wouldnt
bother to take anvthing with me neither
 why
   from what you said-about dyin-
   youre afraid of death
  involuntarily the man shrugged  youre
so sure youre goin to kick off-its sort of
cold-blooded ill tell you what ill do

argosy-allstory weekly
mister-after i get out ill telephone from
some drug store for a doctor for you-on
the level-
  vincente alesandro moved his revolver
slightly
   youll stay right where you are he
said bloodlessly  after all youre just
one of the common herd-sentimental
ive an odd story to tell however im not
telling it for your benefit but my own
now at the last i realize that ive got to
share it-to pour it into human ears how-
ever unappreciative they may be vanity
again strange too until a short time
ago i fancied i would be content to die
with it locked in my breast when you
came the necessity for telling it came also
-and i will not be cheated unless of
course you try to escape in which case i
shall inevitably prevent you the range
is short beyond doubt i could drop you
before you took two steps
  the burglars restless fingers fished a
cigarette and a match out of his vest
shoot he said crisply
   of course it is understood youll take
whatever you like from the house-when
its all over alesandro added  your
predatory instincts will govern that
  the others face flushed  you dont
hold a hell of a high opinion of me do
you he demanded with a sudden unrea-
soning heat
   i suppose i ought to start with my
birth vincente alesandro began ignoring
the words and the tone of his listener  i
am convinced that parentage counts for
nothing somehow i happened to be born
of poor people down south of washington
square a very long time ago i bore their
name perhaps my flesh and blood partook
of theirs but not my self no-that was
different
   they were content in their ignorance
i had a passion for education for the fine-
ness beyond their comprehension it was
extremely easy to gratify my desires my
intelligence was remarkable there are
books and teachers available in limitless
numbers but books were the most im-
portant at twenty-one i was cultured a
gentleman i moved uptown and put be-
hind me the squalor of the slums
   but i did not lose touch with the people
-my race-down there i had a passion
for money and my people were simple
-and greedy it was no effort at all to get
them to invest their savings with me and
i made money for them some of them
   my astuteness enabled me to see that
there was a fortune to be made in building
houses cheap apartments i was very near-
ly infallible in my judgment for a time
i was absolutely honest because i thought
it was the profitable thing but the process
of acquiring wealth through honesty be-
came too slow then i made my bargain
with the devil and he prospered me exceed-
ingly
  the eyes of the burglar widened so sud-
denly and so remarkably that vincente
alesandro checked his speech and a derisive
chuckle arose in his throat
   no simpleton-i dont mean black
magic he said contemptuous of the others
startled look  i spoke figuratively as
soon as i was freed of the shackles of hon-
esty i multiplied my opportunities a hun-
dredfold although the law did in a degree
limit my workings
   i found success-and failure i failed
with a woman-my wife his glance rested
momentarily on the ivory miniature on his
table
   she was a cold northern lily her
frigidity to me fanned me to a flame i
was aware that secretly she despised me-
that she looked down upon me with the
scorn of blue blood upon one of the
canaille you of course cannot understand
how such a thing affected me she was a
living challenge all that i had accom-
plished-all life-was futile as long as this
one particular woman remained unattain-
able such is my nature there remained
but one object in life-to master her
   first i had to accomplish the impossi-
ble feat of marrying her the task was
doubly hard because she was in love with
a worthless young artist a starveling no
man who ever lived except myself could
have accomplished what i did no brain
other than mine could have had the sub-
tlety-no nature other than mine would
have possessed the daring and the courage
to make such a sacrifice
the devils jest

   her father was a man of money i
drew him into financial association with me
for a while i allowed him to prosper then
-mark this well-i steered our partnership
into failure more-criminal failure her
father not only stood to lose his integrity
but he faced prison apparently he was
guilty of fraud while i was innocent no
court on earth could have decided other-
wise
   can you not see the situation-the
lever frankly i made my terms-to the
girl i triumphed the expose came i
was ruined in reputation it was impossible
for me to continue in business yet i had
come out of the scandal with my fortune
hidden away intact money works won-
ders i was acquitted legally-damned
morally but she was m wife her father
died
   yet  failed even as  swindled her
so she swindled me legally she became my
wife she lived in my house her apart-
ment in it is on the other side of the cor-
ridor for twenty years she has kept me
out of every phase of her life with a
stamina that is scarcely credible she has
ignored me yet she kept her pledge she
married me-nothing more
  the burglar in the chair stirred  well
what did you expect he demanded for-
getful of his own situation  dye think
she was goin to fall on your neck after the
way you framed her
  vincente alesandros lips tightened
   i have said that i have a hard nerve
and an inordinate vanity he said coldly
 another man would have shrugged and
admitted defeat i am different i am
capable of living out a single idea to its
conclusion i staked all on one card per-
haps it is all vanity-it matters not
   but i have a clear mind from the be-
ginning i saw that victory was impossible
it was beyond any power i had to triumph
over her spirit did i quit there was
still one compensating opportunity left for
me do you know what it was
  the burglar shook his head
   revenge
  the word was a hiss in the throat of the
man on the bed
   but it must not be crass-common
it had to be a revenge that was beautiful-
it had to be expressive of my personality
you would have beaten her i-i would
wound the spirit my wife as a girl had
never learned the value of money she had
no idea whatever of its importance from
childhood it had flowed like an endless
stream into her hands her attitude toward
it was impersonal i imagine that she
thought no more of it than she did of the
air she breathed
   cannot you see what a weapon i pos-
sessed i placed large sums to her credit
in a checking account she has always had
all she wanted the fine things of life the
expensive luxuries-they are her necessities
in accepting money from me she was scarce-
ly aware of its source certainly she never
fully realized it merely she was drawing
on the same inexhaustible supply she had
always known i went to the pains to see
that she drew it even from the same bank
through which her father had handled her
allowances but as my wife there was
more there was more for her charities
her clothes her cars jewels-everything
and through all of these years our relations
have been-formal you see i foresaw
that i would die long before she did her
age now is forty the best part of her life
remains she is without any relatives what-
ever i am her only source of supply ah
-but i observe that you have not yet be-
gun to see what i am aiming to do 
  the eyes of the burglar were hard a
pool of a scowl had formed between his
brows he was silent again there was
something reminiscently catlike in the face
of vincente alesandro as he moistened his
lips with his tongue
   perhaps you have never heard of gus-
tav von boehm he took up his narrative
again  he is the greatest living specialist
on diseases of the heart a year ago be-
cause he is a wise man he came out of
germany he came to put his great skill
on the market i have had heart trouble
he has treated me from the beginning he
told me frankly there was no hope i have
been doomed for years now i am at the
end he described how the final seizure
would come to me that man knows my
interior as a watchmaker knows the wheels

argosy-allstory weekly
of a watch i have paid him thousands of
dollars-for information
   is it not plain then what i have done
as the time drew short i began to convert
my assets into cash death-i can snap
my fingers at death do you know the
easiest way to get rid of money-more than
a million the stock market-you can
lose it without the slightest chance of ever
getting it back but this house remained
the cars and jewels well she knew nothing
of business quite willingly she signed any
papers i presented mortgage after mort-
gage clear up to the hilt and beyond the
money so realized went into the same maw
and disappeared our current expenses-
borrowed the time was short they would
not press the debts
   and now-i die and she-i have not
victory but i have that which is equally
sweet-revenge she who was used to every
luxury that money could buy-she who
lived as a princess-she will go out into the
world at forty-a pauper
  the burglar half smiled  thats a
scream he muttered
  alesandro did not hear him  fate has
been sweet to me everything is swept
away-i die just in time already there
are the first faint rumblings of the coming
crash one of my creditors telephoned me
to-day i put him off-
   thats a scream  the burglar muttered
again
  for a moment the room was silent and
then came the swift startling ringing of a
telephone in the room the eyes of both
men widened
   hand it to me alesandro command-
ed  ill answer
  the instrument at the end of a long cord
was lifted from a stand by the burglar and
placed in the hands of the recumbent man
 yes    this is he    you-what
suddenly the sound of a french clock
on a mantel of carrara marble became dis-
tinctly audible as vincente alesandros face
began slowly to grow livid as he listened
to the voice that came through the receiver
pressed tightly against his ear a whimsy
played around the thin lips of the burglar
as he looked upon the startled anguish on
the face of the older man
   gee its a scream the thin lips
formed the words soundlessly
  vincente alesandro with a palsied hand
put the receiver on the hook his lids flut-
tered to a close his lips had become ashen
presently he spoke in a voice that was as
dry as hopeless as dust
   she-she met him this afternoon-the
starveling artist she is sailing to-morrow
for paris-for a divorce he-he has at-
tained fame wealth a paroxysm of de-
feat shook the frame of vincente alesan-
dro but i wont live to suffer-thank
god i am dying
  the burglar grinned
  holy smoke-this is a scream he
broke out without restraint  dont you
ever read the newspapers this von
boehm you was tellin me about-didnt
you read about him in to-nights paper
say hes a fake the real von boehms
still in germany this bird here is pinched
-picture on the front page hes been get-
tin slews of rich guys an tellin them they
was about to die hed scare em to death
and then milk em right an you fell for
that faker its a million to one that your
hearts as sound as a dollar watch gee
its a scream an you shot every dime
you had just to leave the dame in the lurch
say you aint goin to die-youre goin
to live for a long while flat busted youre
goin to live
  calmly the burglar picked up his hat
placed it on his head and strode to the
brocaded portiere that led into the next
room where there was an open window
and a fire escape at the exit he stopped
and looked back with a grin
  you poor fish he laughed in fare-
well
  vincente alesandro picked up the shining
pistol and pressed it against his heart which
now was beating firmly and evenly his
finger sought the trigger-and hesitated
then swiftly as though the weapon
burned his fingers he flung it across the
room
   no no he cried in an access of bit-
ter realization  i cannot kill myself-i
have not the courage i am doomed to
live
chapter xxii
the baroness calls
marcus phare made himself con-
versant with the way of jennys
working life he could not be said
to persecute her he was most discreet and
careful not to cause the slightest breath of
gossip but he knew all about her
  he had a cousin mrs ralph tovey a
very smart woman with her he once at-
tended a fashion parade at the big knights-
bridge shop jenny saw him
  she hated him to be there as much out
of professional pride as anything else this
was so different from mme lacours in
deal street in that old world spacious
house everything had been perfect here
in the great show rooms the carpets were
not over clean and there was too much
light and the models were apt to get soiled
through being shown so often one dress
would be copied over and over again with
very trivial differences such a thing was
impossible at mme lacours
  mrs tovey ordered a gown from a model
jenny was wearing this meant that the
girl had to walk about in front of her
phare kept silence lounging in his chair a
half smile on his lips jenny did not know
whether he had told his cousin anything
  the next day was a sunday and jenny
had been bound to accept a luncheon invi-
tation from phare her feelings toward
him had in no wise changed but she re-
belled a trifle less acutely at going about
with him she was getting used to it she
dared not resist his will he had a hold
over her that would only relax when prince
nicholas was safely married
  of course these outings were a break in
her dull life and phare behaved very
well he had not mentioned the prince for
some time it was a fortnight since jenny
had said good-by to nicholas nor did
phare often speak of his feelings for her
but he had an irritating way of assuming
that she was going to marry him
   my cousin mrs tovey thought you
quite charming said phare at lunch
thit tory began in the argosy-allstory weekly for november 


argosy-allstory weekly
   i wish you wouldnt bring your friends
there jenny retorted
   im sorry does it make you feel un-
comfortable i naturally want to know
how you live and i can hardly come
alone theyd think i was on the prowl
but you oughtnt to be there its no place
for you
   i dont mind it
   you ought to mind it do you have to
work hard
   not exactly but theres a lot of dust-
ing and cleaning up and you never know
when you will be wanted and there are
lots of women who come in and make you
put on about two dozen models and go
away without giving an order and that
makes the heads of the show room furious
and they blame us its such a waste of
time
   youre an extraordinary girl com-
mented phare
  a few minutes later he said 
   prince nicholas is going it pretty strong
from all accounts
  jenny started she had thought of him
as back in his own country
   have you heard about it phare
asked
   no
   have you seen him lately
   no 
   so you took my advice wise girl
that young man couldnt be the slightest
good to you it seems hes staying on here
incog i suppose he visits the archduchess
now and then and has a good time in be-
tween there are wild tales about hes
never seen without trixi almette the
french music hall star shes a london
girl really i saw him myself at the metro-
politan club last night he was with her
and a decidedly rapid gang they say hes
sworn everybody to secrecy most of the
people at the metropolitan had no idea who
he was
   trixi was in great form shes about
the commonest little beast on the stage
she was dressed in a pink chiffon scarf and
a row of pearls as big as marbles its an
ill wind that blows nobody any good
jenny sat stiff with misery she knew
that he was trying to make her miserable
she wouldnt believe these ugly tales she
hated him for telling them
  phare offered her his cigarette case
   you were sensible to listen to me
jenny hes been brought up to think he
owns the earth and everything on it-par-
ticularly the women
  she longed to say  i dont believe you
but what was the good
  back in her own little drab room she gave
herself up to a storm of weeping she
spent the rest of the day alone phare
had motored down to brighton for a dinner
engagement with a hungarian prince who
he hinted might have very interesting news
to impart to him about count saxt
  by night jenny was demoralized washed
out with hours of miserable brooding
  nicholas had gone from her she had
sent him away she could not bear her
life he would marry the archduthess
and he would amuse himself that was
what phare had said she could be noth-
ing in his life there was nothing that she
could be
  by the time she crept into her bed under
the dingy coverlet racked with longing and
with loneliness she told herself that she
would be glad to be a trixi almette if she
could only be with him if he only looked
into her eyes and laughed and never thought
of her again
  on the following evening jenny received
a visit from the baroness dora luini
  this time she had to see her in her own
room there was nothing pleasing to the
eye in it except herself and a bunch of
violets that phare had given her
  she was not looking her best it had
been a trying day monday always was
the cinema the restaurants the country
the river-all were too vivid in the young
ladies minds they were mostly inclined
to shirk their work and leave it to anybody
who would do it jenny had done a great
deal more than her share while the other
girls stood in groups or in couples and
the all-absorbing  he said to me  and  i
said to him  passed from the lips of one to
the other
  they took no notice of jenny how
commonplace their own little adventures
another womans life

would have seemed to them if they had
known what secrets were locked away in
her breast they liked her the more
generous among them thought her lovely
but the general feeling was that she was no
sport she had no young man to take her
to cinemas and cheap restaurants and the
 palais de danse  knew her not they
did not like mme lacours young ladies
penetrate into the restaurants where they
might have seen her with marcus phare
  the baroness looked old jenny thought
at first she took it for an ordinary visit-
at least not ordinary but without any spe-
cial purpose it was kind of the baroness
to come
  she asked after jennys health she
learned about berties death and was very
sympathetic she made some vague general
remarks
  the conversation flagged and then jenny
knew that there was something more to
expect
   have you seen prince nicholas the
baroness asked
   not lately the girl answered
   but you have seen him he made me
give him your address he was determined
to see you
   yes i saw him jenny admitted
  the baroness lifted a forlorn face her
shoulders heaved in a helpless way
   oh my dear were in such trouble
the prince refuses to marry the arch-
duchess
  jenny hated herself for the pang of joy
that she could not repress
   he has told me so the precise voice
broke in despair  he has been down
to see her imperial highness two or three
times it was the last time he told me
so that i could tell her and we could ar-
range that the engagement should be broken
off from her side it is dreadful for me
the archduke has almost lost his mind
i mean he is childish its no good talking
to him he is going rapidly to pieces he
never leaves the war maps now we can
with difficulty get him to eat so you see
theres only me the archduchess doesnt
care
   i am very sorry murmured jenny
 it must be dreadful for you
   i have come to vou for help
   to me
   yes you are the only person who can
help us
   i but how
   the prince is fond of you you can
influence him
   how could i possibly influence him
 the archduchess says so you see she
has seen him she is a girl like you are
she knows she says he is in love with you
she says he doesnt think about anybody
but you there are dreadful stories of his
goings on here in london she says hes
doing it because he cant be with you be-
cause you are not the archduchess as he
thought you were she is sure she knows
 but faltered jenny  i dont under-
stand
   you could tell him that he must marry
the archduchess you could influence him
it is his duty he cant honorably leave her
in the lurch he ought to see that what
we did we did in all good faith he ought
to be made to see it
   does the archduchess want to marry
the prince jenny asked
   i dont know that she wants to but
she sees that she must there is her po-
sition the betrothal is known everywhere
you know the truth its useless to pre-
tend to you she has told me that you
know count saxt has deserted her their
marriage is being annulled by the pope
this marriage with prince nicholas is a
settled thing everybody expects it all
sorts of political complications might arise
if it doesnt take place
   what can i do asked jenny
   you can urge him to marry the arch-
duchess you can point out his duty to
him forgive me-you can point out to
him that you can never be anything in his
life will you not do this
  the poor lady was carried away with
her desperate desire her plight was piti-
ful in her frail person was concentrated
by proxy all the greatness and pride of the
house of rosemarks mighty empire from
medieval days she seemed to be left to
lift up the dynasty on her strong support-
ing heart she pleaded as if for her own
honor and her own life

argosy-allstory weekly
   the prince said jenny  knows that
i can never be anything in his life
think of the empress implored the
baroness  the archduchess is thinking
of her stephanie is selfish enough heaven
knows but to save the faintest breath of
scandal about her grandmother she is will-
ing to marry the prince
   i dont think the prince would listen
to me jenny said
   you stand in the way stephanie is
sure of it he has as much as said so he
loves you his thoughts are fixed on you
oh if only you were engaged to another
man if only he could be persuaded that
you could never be anything in his life if
only you were going to marry another
man
  jenny smiled a little bitterly
   but i am not she said  and i
think the archduchess exaggerates
   she is sure she doesnt she is con-
vinced that if the prince knew definitely
that you were out of his reach things would
be different
   he does know it
   but you will help us all the same you
wont refuse you will see the prince and
speak to him
  jenny felt an angry revolt rise in her
the same utter disregard for her she was
to tear her heart to pieces again to see the
prince again when she had said good-by to
him forever in order to persuade him to
marry stephanie
  her impulse was to refuse point blank
hot words of wrathful reproach trumbled
on her lips
  but the baronesss face stopped them
she looked old shrunken desperate
   for the empresss sake she pleaded
from her rich sepulchre the wonderful old
lady was demanding service from the girl
who had already given so much
   i will do what i can jenny said slow-
ly oh but if i had only known i
would never have begun it-never never 
sheer agony was in her brown eyes
there were no questions in them only
stark suffering
   you have been so good said the
baroness helplessly  oh my dear i do
hope that one day you will be very happy
  she recovered herself quickly she was
all eagerness  plow shall we manage
about the prince do you know where to
find him
   yes jenny said  he told me he
was staying at his embassy i thought he
had gone back to galmatia but i heard
yesterday that he was still here
   yes hes going about with very unde-
sirable people and dreadful women oh
and he seemed such a nice young man
will you write to him my dear
   i suppose that will be best but it
will be very difficult i must think about
it it must seem natural or he wont take
any notice
  the baroness rose gratitude pouring
from her lips
   oh how i wish you would be sensible
and let us do something for you  she said
 you ought not to be in a room like this
you ought to have pretty things and to
enjoy yourself
   i am quite happy as i am jenny an-
swered  i have always worked but you
are very kind
   and you will let me know what hap-
pens
   yes at once
   oh i pray you may be successful
   i will do my best jennys voice
sounded dull
chapter xxiii
jennie deals her blow
  will you take me to the metropoli-
tan club jenny asked marcus
phare the next day speaking
over the telephone
  good gracious yes he answered in
surprise  but what ever makes you want
to go there i shouldnt have thought it
was your style at all curiosity came into
his voice  what is the idea eh
   oh nothing she answered carelessly
 i only thought id like to go there ive
heard such a lot about it and i feel dead-
ly dull
  but she knew that it was not dullness
it was death-the death of joy and hope
and youth in her heart
another womans life

   i know why you want to go said
phares voice
  she did not mind she had passed into
another world metaphorically speaking
   i cant promise that he will be there
phare added with subtle mockery
   i dont know what you mean jenny
said
  she dressed herself with great care when
the time came she had made herself a
frock of black peau de sole rigorously plain
she was no needlewoman but she had a
sort of instinct for line and drapery and
though her stitches were clumsy the effect
was good she had bought the stuff at a
special price from her shop the subdued
rich material accentuated the dense white-
ness of her skin her hair burnished by
much brushing lay like a crown close to
her small head its dark gold was almost
metallic some of her tenderness had gone
its place was taken by a mysterious ex-
pression that haunted one it was unex-
pected suffering and difficult for the casual
observer to define
  they did not dine at the metropolitan
club but went on there afterwards
  over dinner phare tried to probe her
mind
   its because youve heard that prince
nicholas has been at the metropolitan that
you want to go there isnt it
   not entirely she said
   im sure it is you want to see trixi
almette well i expect theyll be there all
right they say she gets a new pearl neck-
lace every day i didnt hear anything
about count saxt he added  he seems
to have disappeared i suppose hes made
a pretty penny out of this he was as poor
as a church mouse
  jenny listened hardly hearing her
mind was fixed on the task ahead of her
  the metropolitan astonished her it
was a very plain looking place oak panel-
ing and plaster ceiling a comparatively
small dancing floor and two rows of small
tables all round
  phare had a table in one of the corners
they sat down and had coffee the place
was almost empty phare nodded to sev-
eral men one he introduced to jenny-
lord frederick gore-tempest a middle-
aged open-faced individual with the stamp
of country life on every inch of his spare
figure
  he asked her to dance she danced by-
instinct and he was a perfect partner
phare never danced
  jenny appeared quite gay she had by
no means forgotten bertie but she had a
purpose girls in her way of life could not
adhere strictly to social rules to isolate
themselves because of mourning would lead
many of them to the verge of melancholia
  the room filled up it was what they
called a  gala  night strings of colored
air balloons appeared and were distributed
the little tables were covered with bottles
ordered so as not to clash with the licensing
laws
  jenny sat opposite phare and danced
intermittently with lord frederick gore-
tempest
  at midnight the place was packed jen-
ny was dancing a couple passed her she
saw a whirl of white tulle skirts and a bril-
liant emerald green bow on a mop of tow-
colored hair a vividly painted gamine face
with a snub nose and a broad scarlet mouth
and the strings of enormous pearls that
phare had told her about
  trixi almette her partner was prince
nicholas between them they carried six
red and green balloons
  jennys heart gave a great thud and then
seemed to stop beating tears rose to her
eyes the sight of him was enough his
handsome face his reckless eyes his fly-
ing feet
  presently he walked by with another
woman as she sat at the table with phare
and lord frederick he bowed to her
with a little frigid smile and she thought
he looked furious
  she sat there not knowing how to get
into touch with him he settled the ques-
tion by coming up to her and asking her
to dance phare was alone with her he
gazed abstractedly at the dancers as if he
was not aware of the young mans pres-
ence
  jenny and nicholas moved away the
prince put his arm round her and they
danced as far as the doorway
   there is a room through here nicho-

argosy-allstory weekly
las said  come along i want to talk to
you
  it was a small room at the far end of
two others in the daytime it was used as
a card room
   what are you doing here jenny
nicholas asked as he shut the door
   what are you doing she answered
smiling  enjoying yourself
   youre wrong he said his eyes dark
and stormy  i am not enjoying myself
im killing time
   surely you have plenty to do
   i dont want to do it whats the mat-
ter with you youre horrid jenny dont
you love me any more arent you sorry
you were so cruel you look so adorable
to-night
   please your royal highness we agreed
that we mustnt say such things you are
going to marry the archduchess
   im not going to marry the arch-
duchess ill never marry any woman but
you there you are jenny if i cannot
have you ill die a bachelor
  he came near to her masterful exuber-
antly alive
   oh no she said and she marveled
at the coolness of her own voice  you
mustnt think of such things i dont think
you understand im engaged
  he looked at her and inwardly she shiv-
ered
   you cant mean that he said thickly
 yes i do im engaged to be married
to mr phare the gentleman i am with to-
night
chapter xxiv
for the last time
there followed a short scene that left
jenny shattered and broken and
faced with the end of all things
  the prince crushed her in his arms he
pleaded with all the fire and eloquence of
his passionate youth he swore by all he
held holy that he would never marry
stephanie or any one else he implored
her to wait-only to wait they loved
each other some way must be found if
only she would wait
  she must not engage herself to any man
she must not marry she was his and his
alone she could not be so mad so wicked
as to fling their love aside
  his voice was a torrent sweeping her
along her own replies were thin and spirit-
less and yet she was firm
  it could be no good it could be no
good that was her refrain he was a
prince and she was a manikin even if
they waited forever and ever could any-
thing come of their love
  in the end it maddened him he grew
hard arrogant cruel he flung bitter
words in her face she was selling herself
for money she was no better than the
women of the streets she was only playing
with him all the time
  she stood passive humble distractingly
lovely
  but she was firm she did her duty as
she saw it he was a prince he would
one day be a king it was right that he
should marry stephanie of rosemark her
world and his could never touch
  in the end his anger overcame even his
manners and he flung himself out of the
room leaving her to find her own way back
to the ballroom
  phare was looking for her and shortly
afterward they left
  her last glance showed her trixi al-
mette in the princes arms whirling around
like a dervish there was a look of dis-
gust on several faces jenny heard a man
who did not know the prince mutter
    really i think they ought to be more
careful aldout letting these foreigners in
they dont know how to behave them-
selves
  jenny did not tell phare of her decision
to marry him that night she could not
bring herself to speak the words
  but she wrote to him before she went to
bed
  dear mr phare
     if you still want to marry me i am willing
   to be your wife
yours truly
                         jenny devon
  it was clums even ridiculous but she
could think of nothing else to say
                              a
another womans life

  she posted it on her way to business the
next morning
  he rang her up at the shop before she
left and made an appointment for dinner
  his eager eyes were shining there was
a little tremor of excitement in his quiet
voice as he greeted her
   thank you jenny thats the nicest
letter ive ever had in my life
  his manner was as perfect as ever he
talked less than usual and studied her face
attentively
   flad last night at the metropolitan
anything to do with it he asked her
   what do you mean
   were you disgusted with your prince
   please mr phare-
 mr phare my name is marcus
please marcus she flushed pain-
fully  i would rather not talk about
his royal highness it is very-very awk-
ward for me
   are you going to see him again
   no why should i
   thats all right i believe in keeping
out of danger you really are a very extra-
ordinary girl and now lets make plans
for the future
  jenny was firm on one point she would
stay on at her work until the marriage she
did not demur when he suggested a date
barely six weeks from then but she
breathed a sigh of pathetic relief when she
heard that he was obliged to go over on a
flying trip to new york before the cere-
mony he would be away a month in all
  it was a blessed respite she could hard-
ly believe her good fortune
  he drove her home in his great car in
a quiet and dark bloomsbury street he took
her in his arms and kissed her she all
but cried aloud in her distress how could
she go through with it
  the kisses of love had been so lately
on her lips the glad glorious kisses of youth
and romance and passionate surrender
these were the kisses of the man who had
bought her-not with money but with his
power to take her out of prince nicholass
reach
  that was jenny devons price
  a week later marcus phare sailed on
jennys left hand was a magnificent square
 a
emerald she did not wear it in business
hours
  on the same day she received a letter
from the baroness dora luini
    i can never thank you you have behaved
  faultlessly if only we could do something
  for you all is well here now i wonder
  how you managed it you are as clever as
  you are kind h i h is behaving beautifully
  too i really believe in the end it will be a
  success
  so jennys sacrifice had borne fruit evi-
dently prince nicholas was resigned to mari
riage with stephanie and she to union
with him
  it was a success everybody was pleased
and relieved there would be no scandal
the empresss memory was safe
  before jenny the future loomed intoler-
able-a dreadful dark river into which she
was forced to plunge
  she had done what she believed to be
the right thing to do but she found no
comfort in it
  the next day she saw in a picture paper
a photograph of the archduchess stephanie
and prince nicholas receiving a deputation
from the galmatian colony in london it
was announced that the wedding would
take place in october
but fate had not done with jenny yet
five days after marcus phare sailed she
came back to her lodging on a saturday
afternoon to find a note that her landlady
told her had been left by a messenger boy
she opened it and read
    i shall be waiting at the end of your street
  at four oclock please come there i must
  see you it is most important	n
  it was prince nicholass handwriting
jenny felt a queer thrill go through her
what could he want with her now when
everything was going so well she was a
little angry she felt like some hunted crea-
ture couldnt he leave her alone hadnt
he done her enough harm
  miserable but strangely excited she went
to keep the tryst
  nicholas was just turning the corner from
a side street wher she reached the appointed
pace he wrung her hand without a word

argosy-allstory weekly
he looked as if he were doing something he
hated
   i want you to come back to the castle
he said  where can we go and talk
   regents park suggested jenny faint-
ly  i dont understand
 never mind heres a taxi get in
they drove to the gates of the park it
looked beautiful with its glowing flower
beds and the happy children and all the
older folk basking in the sunshine
   show me a place where there arent
any people the prince said
  jenny led the way into a secluded walk
there was a seat under some hawthorn
trees and they sat down
   stephanie has gone again nicholas
said
   gone again echoed jenny
   yes shes fooled us again she al-
ways meant to his voice was dark with
anger  for the sake of-well god knows
for the sake of what-i agreed to go on
with the farce i suppose it was chiefly
because you told me it was my duty we
were to be married in october as youve
probably heard you were lost to me any-
how so i didnt care she was supposed
to be willing so i was staying at the
castle and we were ostensibly on the best
of terms and this morning we find that
shes gone
   where asked jenny
   the baroness believes that saxt has
sent for her again she is evidently infatu-
ated she would go wherever he called
her i suppose i ought to understand that
jenny id go wherever you called me
  li dont the girl exclaimed his voice
so angry so hurt so humiliated stabbed her
to the heart
   the idea is he went on  that my
aunt the queen of xordland is over here
on a private visit she is my mothers
youngest sister she is coming to stay at
the castle she arrives to-morrow we
cant put her off she is coming to meet
stephanie and stephanie is not there
so if you would be so awfully decent as to
come back to the castle while she is
there-
  the young voice trailed off in furious
disgust
 you ask me to do this said jenny
 hardly believing her ears
  i cant help myself the baroness
 wouldnt do it-thats a fact she is in a
 dreadful state poor soul i said id ask
 you but i didnt think it would be much
 good
  why do you want me to do it she
 asked
  to gain time my aunt wont stay
 long
  is that all
  oh he laughed with a sort of dis-
 mal violence  to be frank because i dont
 want to look a fool
  how would my coming to the castle
 prevent that
  well i suppose we could concoct some
 story-given a little time weve done it
 before havent we
  i see you remember that i am en-
 gaged to be married
 he nodded
  im not likely to forget it i told the
 baroness i didnt suppose youd do it on
 any account
 mr phare is on his way to america
 jenny said  i dont know whether hed
 mind or not as a matter of fact he knows
 all about it
  you told him cried the prince accus-
 ingly
  no he came with that deputation
 from the hospital to present the wedding
 gift he recognized me then
 suddenly nicholas clutched her hand
  is that why you are marrying him
 his eyes glowed
 jenny thought for a moment and then
 said slowly
  i am marrying him because i think it
 is the best thing i can do
  the best but not the thing you want
 to do oh jenny i cant stand this lying
 are you marrying him because if you
 didnt he might tell
 she could not speak she hung her head
 he gripped her hand until she cried out with
 pain
  will you come he asked dully
  yes she said equally dully  i will
 come it will be for the last time wont it
 nicholas

   for the very last time he answered
gloomily  we will bury everything that
has happened between us you and i

acting once more
back to the rouge pot and the powder
puff and the lip salve back to the
beautiful clothes and the ruby ring
that stephanie had left behind her on her
dressing table without a line of comment or
farewell
  on what mysterious pilgrimage had that
strange girl set out was it the irresistible
call of love had the man she had given
her heart to the power to draw her after
him wherever he went even after he had
shamed and deserted her was that the
kind of stuff she was made of under her
hard cynical daring ways
  jenny sent a telegram to the shop where
she worked saying that she was unexpected-
ly called away on urgent family matters
it would not matter whether she went back
there or not nothing mattered-now
  nicholas was just as ready to use her as
the rest of them between them they would
gradually crush the life out of her-to safe-
guard their position and their pride
  she felt broken dull indifferent noth-
ing mattered now
  it felt strange to enter the castle walls
again she drove down by the car and
the great pile looked like a fairy city in
the june sunlight set in the midst of its
vast woods of ancient beeches oaks and
elms
  the archduke gabriel was confined to his
own apartments his mind was going rap-
idly and he was under constant medical
supervision
  jenny saw prince nicholas before din-
ner she was all prepared-powder and
paint and hair she had even achieved a
smile that felt as if it were nailed to her
lips
   his royal highness insists on seeing you
alone said the baroness nervously she
looked as if she had lost her grip on things
  of course it will be easier for you wont
it now he knows but remember he may
be in a reckless mood he has been com-
pletely fooled this time we are going to
dine in the small dining room belonging to
the cedar suite so you had better see him in
the china room i neednt ask you to be
careful i know you will be
   you neednt be afraid said jenny
quietly  his royal highness and i know
exactly where we stand
  so it was in the little cedar-lined china
room of dear and cruel memories that they
met
  nicholas was pale his eyes smoldered
there was a dangerous curve in his lips
his first words to her were abrupt and rude
 i almost hate you with that powder
and paint on your face to think that
youve got to do it because of that- but
i wont offend your ears i cant speak
of her in decent language it was good
of you to come but i think i hate you for
coming a pretty farce isnt it and for
the first time the two of us are in it
   you told me that you wished me to
come jenny said as calmly as she could
   of course theres nothing else for it
my aunt the queen of nordland is a bit of
a busybody she would have ferreted
everything out and until i know whats
become of that wretched-oh whats the
good im not in the mood to confess that
ive been made a fool of when weve got
rid of my esteemed aunt i shall settle every-
thing once and for all
  jenny played nervously with some flowers
on a table
  he caught her roughly in his arms and
kissed her
  oh she put her hand to her lips
as if he had hurt her his strength over-
mastered her it was something she couldnt
fight against
   i ought not to be here she murmured
 if i am to stay you must-
  behave he put in with repressed
fury  what mad things you women do
you love me and you know i love you
and you go and promise yourself to another
man what for to get out of my reach
i suppose and because this man you are
going to marry knows the truth but youll
never get out of my reach you love me
you are mine youll always be

argosy-allstory weekly
  she gave a little sob
  oh dont cry he exclaimed sardoni-
cally  youll mess up all that stuff on
your face dont worry ill behave i
understand you and i are the sport of
the gods and you are spoiling your life for
my sake and i can never do anything in
return no doubt i shall get over it there
is plenty of fun to be got out of life
  she thought of the  other women of the
trixi almettes and her heart was pierced
with jealousy and despair for him there
was  fun but for her-nothing noth-
ing life with marcus phare a life of
horror
  the queen of nordland arrived on the
sunday afternoon she was on her way
south to galmatia to visit her sister and
she was spending a few days in england
strictly incognito
  she was a woman of thirty-five who
looked at least five years younger she
had a clever dark face and beautiful glossy
black hair and she was extremely smart
and well turned out she was a modem
woman in every sense of the word
  her country was a very democratic one
which suited her exactly for she had no
patience with court etiquette and loathed
ceremonies from the first she deprecated
the endless curtsies and the artificial for-
malities of the castle and laughingly said
that it reminded her of a medieval tomb
  she was a widow with three children
and she was the regent during her eldest
sons minority he was a boy of fifteen
she was a great traveler a brilliant talker
and was known all over europe for her
broad views and her encouragement of edu-
cation and of the arts
  it was somewhat unkind of nicholas to
call her a busybody but she was undoubt-
edly intensely interested in everything and
everybody and only too naturally in the
girl her handsome nephew was going to
marry
   you must call me nunt adela she
said to jenny when the girl was presented
to her  and we must be great friends
  on the day of her arrival she was a little
tired but the next morning she made the
girl take a long walk in the park with her
   my sister will want me to tell her
all about you she said in her vivacious
voice  so i must find things out it
was too sad that your grandmother should
die just then but my sister hopes you
will be able to go and spend a week or
two with her at the end of july in the
mountains and i understand the wedding
will probably take place in galmatia now
jenny had heard nothing of this so she
did not answer
   of course when your grandmother was
alive it was different the queen went on
 but now with the poor archduke so ill
it will be more suitable to have the wedding
over there
  then followed a volley of questions to
which jenny replied as best she could
danger certainly gave her courage in
those ways she always showed herself a
thoroughbred she even achieved a fair
imitation of the archduchesss manner
which she kept up to prince nicholass
sardonic amusement when they were all
three together with the baroness and gen-
eral mortis in attendance
  the queen stayed three days and went
on two long motor trips with them she
constantly urged them to take more exer-
cise
   you ought to play golf and tennis you
two stephanie has quite a drawn look
because youre in mourning its no good
ruining your health and i hear she has
even given up riding i call that stupid
the atmosphere of this house is positively
archaic
  nicholas did all the prevaricating and he
did it remarkably well his aunt who had
not seen him for several years was evident-
ly very much taken with him
    hes the sweetest thing she said to
jenny  i think youre very lucky my
dear with people like us it is such a toss
up and hes lucky too i must say that
you ought to make a splendid thing out
of life i wonder she added irrelevantly
 why you make up so much youre such
a lovely girl-it doesnt seem necessary
didnt your grandmother object
   no said jenny she spoke truthfully
enough though it was but a guess on her
part the late empress in spite of her auto-
another womans life

cratic nature had been extraordinarily in-
dulgent to stephanie probably because she
was the only child of her best beloved son
  the queen went to london for a couple
of days and then came back to argar
castle for a day and a night before leaving
for galmatia nicholas was to follow in
about a weeks time
  the queen took jenny into her beautiful
tapestried chamber with the priceless
lacquer and gilt furniture and the old
venetian mirrors and chandelier of the
unique golden glass
   i want a little chat with you she said
 ive been hearing tilings about nicholas
in london there is rather an unpleasant
feeling up there hes been racketing about
too much it seems of course one knows
young men do whatever their station in
life but apparently hes been a little too
open about it you must keep him in order
my dear i m not going to ask you whether
youre really in love with him it would
be cheek and you probably wouldnt tell
me but such a lot depends upon you
any one can see that hes crazy about
you
  jenny started and looked at the queen
in dismay
   oh yes any woman could see it with
both eyes shut repeated the queen  but
im not so sure about you and thats rath-
er dangerous-for nicholas
  she changed the subject abruptly
  it chanced that that evening xicholas
and jenny were alone in the billiard room
the girl showed a natural aptitude for the
game and the prince made a good in-
structor
  the queen of xordland had dined in her
own rooms pleading a headache jenny and
xicholas with the suites in attendance had
got through theirs as quickly as possible
the strain on the principal actors was im-
mense
  coming out of the billiard room when
the game was finished nicholas switched
off the lights the great corridor was dim-
ly lighted with candles and with one of his
irresistible impulses he put his arms round
the girl and kissed her
   jenny my jenny how can we go on
playing this game he whispered  you
know when im hateful to you its just be-
cause i cant bear it
  the girl lay for a moment passive before
she realized that everything had changed
the touch of his lips had brought back for
an instant the old feeling of incredible hap-
piness
  and just then it happened that the
queen of xordland came along the corridor
and saw them
  xicholas was equal to that situation as
well as any other he laughed and drew
jennys arm through his and addressed the
queen with engaging bonhomie
    youve caught us billing and cooing
aunt adela promise you wont tell
  the next morning the queen told jenny
how glad she was she had surprised that
little scene
   you mustnt mind my dear it was so
human young people should make love
somehow i was a little afraid about you
but now im not at all
  before she left there was another inci-
dent that made things more difficult than
ever it seemed as if this play acting were
doomed to publicity
  it was a feast day of the church a
procession of children from the schools and
from the household had been organized by
the priests to make a circuit of the castle
and the queen of xordland asked xicholas
and jenny to walk down to the entrance
gates with her to see it before her car left
for the coast to catch the boat how could
they refuse
   it was a beautiful sight the long line of
white clad children with rose wreaths on
their hair holding lighted tapers in their
little hands and singing lustily and the
priests in their robes and the banners and
the swinging censers and the great silver
cross
  there was a crowd of people on the
green opposite the castle gates motor cars
and bicycles and pony traps were halted
  the queen insisted on crossing the moat
and going right out through the massive
gates when the procession had passed
the crowd respectfully saluted the royalties
then a cinematograph operator appeared
and very modestly pleaded to be allowed

argosy-allstory weekly
to transfer the movements of the royal
party to his film
  the queen in her genial way gave him
instant permission nicholas and jenny
were helpless and so they all three
moved about like puppets for his benefit
  the operator went away beaming en-
slaved by her majestys condescension and
charm
  nicholas was cursing inwardly and
jenny was wondering hopelessly how it was
all going to end
   i believe in encouraging these people
the queen said  you young people are
so shy it doesnt cost us anything and
it does them a lot of good she laughed
merrily  you two looked positively
wretched and nicholas fiddled with his
tie 
   he always does said jenny feeling
that if something did not relieve the tension
she would have to shriek
    i feel such an idiot the prince admit-
ted laughing  im not a beautiful girl
like stephanie he added wickedly
  she met his eyes her head was in a
whirl how could he be so gay so careless
she was on the verge of hysteria she could
not get used to this position during the
next day or two all over the country her
face and figure would be flashed on the
screen as the archduchess stephanie she
had been taken side by side with nicholas
walking through the castle archway and
between nicholas and the queen of nord-
land watching the tail end of the proces-
sion in nearly every cinema in the land
the audiences would gaze on her as she had
gazed on the real archduchess during the
run of the argar vale
   the childrens shrill sweet voices in the
distance mocked her intolerably as they
walked back through the great stone court-
yard to where the queens car was waiting
chapter xxvi
terrible tidings
there was no news of stephanie the
same people were searching for her
jenny could see that the baroness had
lost heart  what are we to do she
exclaimed wringing her hands  what are
we to do
  but there was no news forthcoming
prince nicholas had gone to london
again for a few days he was coming back
for forms sake to take his leave of the
archduchess before he returned to galma-
tia
    this will be the end the baroness
said tears streaming down her face  it
will all have to come out we shall not be
able to keep it a secret
   why not jenny tried to console her
 after all if it has gone too far when the
archduchess comes back you can give out
that she has broken off the engagement
but think of the talk the scandal
people in her station of life dont break off
their engagements and things would be
sure to leak out and how do we know that
she will come back
   she must said jenny  she must
but she was by no means convinced
things certainly looked very dark the
girls kind heart bled for the poor lady in
waiting who had become an heroic figure
in her eyes never it seemed to her had a
woman borne such a heavy burden and got
so little thanks
  the prince came back
  they faced each other he and jenny
in the little china room of many memories
after dinner he was leaving by the morn-
ing boat
  this was realty the end
   i dont hate you so much for fooling
me the prince said  as i hate you for
throwing me over
   that is nonsense said jenny she
was determined to be brave and calm
   you ought not to be able to marry
another man he insisted  i know you
are doing it for my sake i hate you for
it and i adore you for it but you ought
to have waited
   what for she asked
   oh i dont know he answered impa-
tiently  but something might have turned
up as it is i am going home and we
shall never meet again you will be the
wife of a rich man you dont love you
will wear jewels and eat rich meals and
another womans life

grow fat bah it makes me sick it
makes me mad
jenny looked at him she tried to make
her eyes hard
 in plain english she asked  what
could i have been to you
  in plain english he answered angrily
  i dont know but you neednt have been
 in such a hurry youve left me with noth-
 ing
  you can have your  fun she reminded
 him out of the bitterness of her heart
it is very much overrated he an-
swered grimly
 he came near to her
    jenny this is good-by
she broke down quite suddenly the
strain was too much she sobbed convul-
sively as he caught her in his arms
 do you love me he whispered
 dont ask me dont ask me i cant
stand any more
 he stroked her hair
    poor little girl its a shame they
brought you into this it wasnt your fault
just because you were good natured and
looked like stephanie ive been rather a
brute to you pure selfishness i wanted
you so but youll be much better off its
quite true i havent anything to offer you
good-by jenny-good-by
 they clung together outside in a group
 of ash trees near the moat a nightingale
 was singing bursting his heart with joy
the baroness came into the room she
was walking very funnily
jenny gave a gasp as she and nicholas
sprang apart and the prince went to the
baronesss assistance
    what is the matter he asked
    the archduchess is dead said the lady
 in waiting
 the words fell on the rose scented room
 like a mysterious unsubstantial weight in
 the ash grove the nightingale went on burst-
 ing his little heart with song
   prince nicholas dropped the baroness
into a chair
    she sat rocking herself to and fro in silent
 anguish
     tell us what you mean madame said
nicholas impatiently
   the archduchess is dead repeated the
lady in waiting  monsignor stellaria her
confessor has just arrived he looks like
death himself he went in search of her
the other day just as he went before to
constantinople he has more influence over
her in a way than anybody else she had
only got as far as paris he found her
there-in a poor lodging she had gone to
that dreadful man as i feared he had
met her in paris
   nobody knew who they were they
were about to move on somewhere else when
-when she caught cold and pneumonia set
in and she died she had never really got
over her illness in constantinople when
monsignor stellaria got to the house which
he discovered through an old servant who
was with him and happened on the place by
chance he found that count saxt had shot
himself on her dead body
  jenny shuddered nicholas stood pale
and obviously moved
   monsignor stellaria managed to quiet
the suspicions of the police the baroness
went on li he described them both as
members of her late majestys household
gave false names and arranged everything
they are bringing her back here for burial
 when did it happen asked the prince
 a week ago
t- as long as that 
   yes a week ago she has been dead a
week and we didnt know
  the poor lady was on the verge of faint-
ing nicholas went out to get her some
water when she had revived a little jen-
ny helped her to her rooms
  there she clung to the girl sobbing hys-
terically
   oh my dear there is something more
dreadful still the archduchess was de-
mented she must have been she wrote
to saxt telling him that she would commit
suicide if he didnt allow her to return to
him monsignor stellaria found the letter
in the counts pocket it is a terrible letter
i have taken on myself to burn it evident-
ly he told her to meet him in paris oh
but he behaved shamefully he actually
took money from monsignor stell arias
agents to desert her i suppose i oughtnt
to speak like this- he is dead too re-

argosy-allstory weekly
morse came to him in the end may he find
mercy in heaven she crossed herself
  jenny was crying quietty it was such a
pitiful story
  the baroness was a tragic figure she
had given her life in the service of this great
family and she was seeing it crumble to
pieces before her eyes-the former empress
dead the archduchess dead the archduke
gabriel with his reason gone truly the
mighty were fallen and in the frail per-
son of dora luini there still lived the pas-
sion of loyalty and in her heart and brain
was the determination to uphold their pride
and greatness and their unsullied honor be-
fore the world
   nobody knows she said when she re-
covered herself  monsignor stellaria has
behaved with genius the world will never
know of her terrible end she will be
brought here and buried quietly and we
can announce her death in a fitting manner
it will be quite easy to understand that we
couldnt have a grand funeral with the arch-
duke in this condition
   yes said jenny  i am glad that
the world will not have to know
  so the hour of her freedom had struck
which was also the hour of her bondage
for nicholas would go home and another
bride would be found for him and she
must keep her word and marry marcus
phare
  some one knocked at the door it proved
to be general mortis
   his royal highness requests that you
and miss devon will come at once to the
library he said to the baroness  he is
there with monsignor stellaria they have
something of great importance to say to
you
  the two women went down
  nicholas was standing with his back to
the fireplace monsignor stellaria a mid-
dle-aged man of frail and ascetic appear-
ance sat in an armchair his cheeks were
like snow and his thin hands lay like old
ivory on his black cassock with the touch
of wine red about the collar
  he wore a skull cap on his head and
scanty iron gray hair escaped from under it
  nicholas asked the ladies to be seated
   have you thought about this compli-
cation he asked  i wish to warn you
at once that we shall have to be very care-
ful the archduchess was dead two days
before my aunt adela left the castle my
aunt will tell my mother all about her she
was dead on the day when my aunt miss
devon and i went to watch the procession
that night in london we three were shown
on the screen at the picture houses the
archduchess was already dead
  the baroness gave a cry of horror and
covered her face with her hands jenny
looked vaguely from one to the other mur-
muring
   i dont understand
  the prince looked at the monsignor
   will your reverence explain he
asked
  the priest inclined his head and ad-
dressed the baroness in a voice full of gentle
music
   our first consideration must be to safe-
guard the archduchesss honor he began
 i am sure we are all agreed about that
as his royal highness has explained the
archduchess was actually dead at the time
his aunt the queen of nordland was here
and when the features of this young lady
were flashed on the screen of the cinemas as
representing her imperial highness this
places us in a most delicate position it
means that we can never make public the
real date of the archduchesss death without
confessing that we had provided a substi-
tute when she ran away with count saxt
dead silence greeted this obvious truth
 it is not only ourselves and his royal
highness who are involved but also the
dead - the memory of her late imperial
majesty and by inference the honor of his
imperial highness the archduke went on
the suave voice  to allow this story to
teach the public ear would do irreparable
harm inestimable damage
   what can we do asked the baroness
despairingly  what is the good of keep-
ing it up his royal highness cannot
marry miss devon
   i suggest that we gain time said the
priest i am a little afraid of the rela-
tions of count saxt they may cause
trouble i wish to deal with them myself
another womans life

let us try to see this matter from some
other standpoints-for instance from that
of the queen of nordland it would be an
unnecessary shock to give her majesty-
that the young lady she saw so blooming
and happy here should have died within a
day or so of her departure it would be
asked why we did not cancel the film
which i understand is still being shown
we should find it very difficult to answer
these questions-very difficult indeed
   tell your plans monsignor suggested
nicholas
  he looked grave and no wonder here
was a situation which unless handled with
all skill might cause the moral collapse not
only of his own family but of that of rose-
mark
   i suggest that his royal highness should
go home to-morrow as was intended said
the priest  i suggest that miss devon
should be good enough to stay on here for
another few days-perhaps a week per-
haps more we can then in due course
announce the peaceful death of the arch-
duchess and hold a quiet funeral service
and miss devon can then be free once
more to live her own life followed by our
undying gratitude and fervent blessings
   count saxts people queried nich-
olas shortly
   your royal highness i think i can deal
with them replied monsignor stellaria
who was showing himself undoubtedly as
much a diplomat as a churchman  what
we need above all things is a few days in
which to adjust ourselves-to be quite sure
that we have left no loose ends that the
paris police were absolutely satisfied
nicholas looked at jenny
   what do you say miss devon he
asked formally
  the girl answered in confusion
   i cannot stay long-really i cannot
and as the baroness says what good would
it do
   a fortnight at the most replied the
soothing voice of the priest i guarantee
that we shall have disposed of this most
sad difficulty by then
   very well jenny said despondently
she reckoned that would still give her a day
or two before marcus phare came back
  there seemed to be no end to it de-
ceit followed on deceit lie on lie linked in
an endless chain
chapter xxvii
confession
so it was arranged jenny found her-
self transferred to monsignor stellaria
for instruction it appeared that he
had to proceed on the continent at once to
get into touch with the relatives of count
saxt
  the archduchesss plain coffin arrived on
the following night and was laid secretly in
the family vault only six people knew
the truth
  all that was wanted of jenny was to
stay in the castle in case any urgent occa-
sion should arise for the archduchess to be
seen the priest did not anticipate it but
always one had to be prepared he im-
plored her to behave as she had always
done he relied absolutely on her and on
the baroness
  jenny did not see prince nicholas again
before he left he sent her a note worded
in terms of grave tenderness it was no
time to speak of love she knew and yet it
chilled her for the first time she seemed
to feel that he was resigned to lose her
no doubt this terrible tragedy had made
him see things in a different light
  monsignor stellaria left the clay after the
prince
  that morning the baroness collapsed and
had to take to her bed
  jenny was left to her own devices gen-
eral mortis and the countess grioch were
in attendance on her the general was el-
derly and kind but too perturbed to carry
on ordinary conversation and the countess
was a very timid little old lady who treat-
ed the girl as if she were afraid of her
  so she was entirely alone
  she visited the baroness in her rooms
after lunch then a message was brought
that the archduke wanted to see her she
found him quite childish and very much
aged and withered there were two at-
tendants with him
he smiled vacantly at her and stroked

argosy-allstory weekly
her hair and led her to his big table with
the war maps on it and he began to throw
the toy soldiers on to the floor and she
picked them up for him
  it was a saddening experience the
great house was like a tomb
  she decided to go for a walk the park
was very vast she followed one of the
wide grass rides that stretched as far as
the eye could see and found herself in the
woods then she walked right round the
inner walls and came back through the
formal gardens and the wonderful rose gar-
dens and the huge clipped yew walks to
the stone courtyard
  at the entrance doors of the castle she
saw a motor car drawn up she went on
not daring to turn back lest she had been
observed as she reached the steps a stout
lady was getting out of the car she was
fair and rather florid she was dressed in
dark traveling clothes
  another lady descended behind her
there were several servants grouped be-
hind general mortis who was awaiting the
lad he went forward to meet her and
bowed very low over her hand
jenny heard him say  your majesty
she did not know what to do this was
evidently another queen xo royal per-
sonage had been expected the old soldier
looked perturbed
  jenny sent him a despairing glance
  just then the stout lady turned and
caught sight of her general mortis mut-
tered something almost unintelligible
  jenny mechanically made a curtsy and
the next thing she knew was that she was
clasped to the stout ladys breast and a
jolly voice that exactly suited the pleasant
rather homely face was exclaiming
   oh this of course is stephanie my
dear i knew you at once from your photo-
graph but you are even prettier than i
thought possible lucky nicholas and
isnt it a shame that i have missed my
boy i heard that he left only yesterday
we must have crossed each other some-
where-i expect in paris
  jenny wanted to sink through the earth
as she realized that this was nicholass
mother
yes my sister adela gave such a glow-
ing account of you the queen went on
 and i had to come to paris on an unex-
pected visit to a very old and dear friend
who is lying ill so  couldnt resist the
temptation of having a peep at my future
little daughter and  rather hoped my boy
would still be here to take me back but
never mind youll put me up for the
night and we can have a cozy chat to-
gether about nicholas
  jenny did not know how the next few
moments passed it seemed an eternity
before she could bring herself to speak
but as a matter of fact very little was re-
quired of her the queen of galmatia was
a most voluble lady and her kind heart
shining in her kind face proclaimed the
fact that she found jenny everything that
was to be desired
  between them jenny and general mortis
explained the position-that the archduke
was not in a state to receive her majesty
that they hoped she would forgive them
for not being prepared for her visit and
would overlook any shortcomings
   but the queen was not difficult to please
while the state rooms were hastily pre-
pared she devoured her tea with a great
appetite and she hoped they would dine
quite cn jumille and not make any fuss
about her at all
  her lady-in-waiting was a good-looking
placid young woman who sat smiling and
saying very little many words were prob-
ably never required of her
  the queen was conducted to her rooms
by jenny the girl would have left her
but she was not allowed to
  just go into that beautiful room next
door said her majesty  and wait for me
while i wash my hands and slip into an-
other gown and then well have a talk
  jenny was obliged to comply with this
request which was virtually a command
  she stood like a statue by one of the
great latticed windows while she waited
looking over the formal terraced gardens
with their carpets of brilliant flowers they
were chiefly red and orange flowers and re-
minded her of fire and blood
  the queen came in she looked much
younger without her hat rather like a
lumpy overgrown fair-haired girl
another womans life

  she came up to jenny and gave her an-
other affectionate hug
   just to see you is to love you she
said
  then something snapped in jennys
head everything she had been told went
out of her mind she forgot convention
and expediency she forgot the archduch-
esss honor and the empresss memory and
nicholass pride she only knew that this
could not go on
  she could not and would not deceive
nicholass mother
  she fell on her knees and began to sob
out her story
  the queen stared at her blankly
   i am not the archduchess stephanie
said jenny brokenly  i am jenny de-
von-i was a manikin the archduchess
ran away and they made me come here to
take her place they say i am exactly like
her and now she is dead and you are
nicholass mother and i cant-i cant lie
to you
  this cant be true cried the amazed
lady  my poor child you must be mad
   it is true-indeed it is true
  the queen bent and pulled jenny to her
feet
   you must begin again if you are sure
you are telling me the truth
  jenny gave a cry as the door opened and
prince nicholas came in in traveling
clothes his cap in his hand
  he looked from one to the other then
said quietly
   so the cats out of the bag
  jenny went on sobbing she could not
control herself the prince came over and
took her hand
   you have told my mother the truth
he said  whv did vou do that
   i could not do anything else she an-
swered suddenly calm  i could not lie
to your mother
   how did you get here my boy the
queen asked  oh but i am glad you
have come my head is whirling this
story is too fantastic for me to grasp
   i heard this morning in paris that you
had passed through he answered  so
i went to the british embassy and they
kindly wired for a gunboat to take me over
the water i was afraid of this as soon as
i heard that you were in this country it
is a pity you had to know mother mine
i am sorry our deception was almost
over we were all going back to our own
lives he gave a sad little smile  but
you must not blame jenny i cant allow
that
   i cant understand cried the queen
 i havent taken it in
  jenny had undoubtedly been incoherent
nicholas now told the story in simple di-
rect words
  his mother listened in silence and her
face grew grave
   since you have forgiven the deception
nicholas she said when he had finished
 theres nothing for me to say but how
do you expect to get out of this fearful
muddle of course nothing must leak out
it would be a frightful scandal we should
all suffer-the innocent as well as the
guilty it would do more harm than
good
  it was the same spirit that they all dis-
played thought jenny though now with-
out bitterness they stood together the
honor of one royal house was the honor of
all the others
   and it would not bring the poor girl
back to life concluded the queen
to be concluded next week
                       tr
if i dream you
      iife they say is a little sleep
          perhaps its true
      well i shant mind if in the sleep
      i may dream you
mary carolyn davies
by john scarry
john ferguson was to leave sura-
baya only that morning the pennsyl-
vania oil company had ordered him to
singapore there to be assistant general
manager of the malayan territory
  the first one to know about his good
fortune was mary campbell mary was
the daughter of old jock campbell director
in surabaya of the straits  java bank
to-day after office hours ferguson had
picked her up at her home and whisked
her out to goonoong sari for a round of
golf
  the evening was incomparable by the
time the suns rays were slanting from
beyond tall tamarinds to the west the man
and girl had finished nine holes they
were now refreshing themselves with ginger
beer on the clubhouse veranda
  there was something delightful about
mary campbell she was not beautiful
perhaps but ferguson had come to see more
than beauty in her wholesome good looks
glowing with perfect health in sweater and
tweed skirt golfing brogues and thick wool
stockings she was like a breath of the good
wind that sweeps across scotch heather
  needless to say ferguson had long since
fallen in love with her
  he had never confessed his love how-
ever and as a man of honor he was sure
in his mind he never would nevertheless
his voice held a strange eagerness
  mary campbell listened breathlessly a
soft cry of genuine gladness leaped to her
lips coloring swiftly she offered her hand
across the scarred teak table for a
moment her fingers rested firmly in fer-
gusons firmly-and the contact ran
through the man like an electric shock
  nothing extraordinary in that to be
sure things had been that way with
ferguson these many months but sud-
denly miraculously it was as though he
now had vision to see deep below the sur-
face to observe the true feeling that lay
behind the girls congratulations
  what he discovered was overwhelming
  mary campbell returned his love her
interest paralleled his own

bondage

  ferguson knew he was not mistaken
true other than that first mounting flush
she gave no outward sign there was cer-
tainly nothing more than comradely re-
joicing in her regard yet the man knew
he was convinced as he was of anything
in this world that he need only step around
the table and he could take his love into
his arms
  but he made no move
  and presently as he walked beside the
girl down to where his chauffeur was wait-
ing with the car fergusons brain was in a
painful tumult torn by conflict he thrilled
in everj fiber with the wonder of his
knowledge and he struggled desperately
against the happiness that possessed him
for chilling him with the truth of its pro-
test was an inward voice arguing that the
situation was unspeakably tragic
ii
  nine years previously when he was
twenty-one ferguson had come out to
java a raw bewildered youth at the
time more than a little terrified at the
prospect of working for yankees an
uncle employed in calcutta by the penn-
sylvania oil company had got the young
fellow his chance
  following a surabaya custom of those
days-and of to-day for that matter-two
men from the office came down to meet
their new colleague at the dock the two
men were americans self-confident friend-
ly they had not been very long in the
country but they knew the business of
welcoming first with speed to the oranje
hotel to hustle ferguson into clean white
drill and half an hour later found all three
of them moored to the marble of the sim-
pang bar
  ferguson was a scotchman but never
before that night had he seen scotch
whisky handled so recklessly
  in the morning the two americans fresh
as though nothing had happened breezed
into the hotel again to rouse ferguson out
of bed ferguson gazed at them mourn-
fully felt moved to announce the unswerv-
ing probity of his future conduct but the
americans only laughed at his headache
and scoffed at his remorse still laughing
they escorted the sufferer downtown to the
office
  charlie wells popularly known through-
out the far east as the bald-headed eagle
was then surabaya manager for the penn-
sylvania and despite the dullness of fer-
gusons morning head the young scot could
see how well the nickname fitted charlie
wells had the keen look of an eagle
   youll do two years here in the office
said he coming to business without great
delay  at least two years make it less
if you can depends on how quickly you
can learn the language
   malay sir ventured ferguson hope-
fully he was bent on making a good
first impression
  charlie wells snorted
   hell no youll learn that or starve
malays a cinch youll pick it up from
your boy in three months time but
dutch is a different proposition i cant
send you travelling until youre pretty good
at it youll need it of course the dutch-
men youll meet at the club can all speak
english but in business youll run into
plenty who cant half-castes most of
em youll insult em if you spring malay
so dutch is the thing and youll need a
teacher
  the bald-headed eagle swung around in
his chair
   miss van der bent
  a girl of whom ferguson had been
vaguely aware turned from a row of steel
letter-files across the office
  the young fellow watched her approach
she was such a girl as he never before had
seen brown skinned so she must be a
native a javanese he thought but she
was dressed in european clothes-and her
name was van der bent could she be
dutch-with that coloring and those queer
eyes
  then he remembered why of course
here was one of those half-castes mr wells
had mentioned odd looking-good look-
ing the boy decided
  good looking hardly described her just
then perhaps jacqueline van der bent was
not the dazzling creature she was later to
become hers was not the beauty to show

argosy-allstory weekly
to best advantage in simple office garb
but the beauty was there-in ambush
  she was tall slender and her young body
was full-ripe with an indolent supple grace-
fulness which called up visions of sensuous
native dances she had long thick wavy
black hair limpid dark eyes that slanted
alluringly toward her straight nose she
had tiny sensitive hands and small feet
  and her skin was not brown far from
it ferguson was afterward to look upon
it as the color of pale gold of mellowed
ivory the color which replaces in the orient
the lily-white of western poetry
  now however he only stared in some
curiosity and mr wells spoke to the girl
in english
   who teaches dutch around here miss
van der bent whom do we always get
   why i could not say she answered
 we have not had the occasion to employ
a dutch teacher since i am here mr
conant and mr parry have learned a little
dutch already-in semarang and mr
hagenberg of course is a hollander
  jove she spoke english well-with a
hint of twisty accent that was strangely
entrancing must be a half-caste of the
better sort
   hm thats right too mr wells was
saying  well look it up will you you
can find out from some of those old vouch-
ers in the storeroom try two years ago
mr ferguson heres got to have a dutch
teacher
  of a sudden ferguson actually felt the
girls regard it might have been cool im-
personal so far as she was concerned but
the survey of those dark eyes had the in-
stant effect of fire in the boys blood then
jacqueline van der bent flashed a brief
smile toward the bald-headed eagle
   if you are willing sir and if mr
fairguson is willing i would teach mr
fairguson dutch  have time to spare
after office and i have done teaching
  charlie wells looked interested and he
probably knew no reason why his subordi-
nate should be unwilling-which indeed
ferguson was not
   why thats fine miss van der bent
thats just the thing all right youll look
out for mr ferguson the company pays
of course go along with her ferguson
and fix it up and remember ill be get-
ting reports on how you study
  ferguson went along if mr wells had
suggested that he go find a raging orang-
utan and learn monkey-talk from the beast
he would have gone just the same
iii
  that was how it began the rest is an
old story-in the east in america very
likely a book of many chapters would
hardly suffice to bring about understanding
  in that book there would have to be a
chapter describing the effect on ferguson
of perfumed javanese nights of palm trees
glistening in white moonlight of exotic
sounds and songs filtering into the bare
room where the boy sat studying for he
held to his vow to shun the simpang bar
  there would have to be a chapter setting
forth the deliberate intent of a girl who
was centuries wiser than any twenty-one
year old scotchman a girl whose whole
traditional ambition was a white husband
  and there would have to be a chapter on
lonesomeness especially a chapter on
lonesomeness
  a lonesome land java its lonesome-
ness for ferguson was inescapable throt-
tling him like the old man of the sea even
on the rare occasions when he found himself
in crowds he was twenty-one and his
home life had been sheltered loving a trifle
strait-laced he needed a little sympathy
a little beauty of thought a little innocent
excitement perhaps and the companion-
ship of warm-hearted humanity
  he encountered everywhere instead the
callousness that is all the east
  he married jacqueline van der bent after
he had known her six months it was easy
for jacqueline she wanted a white hus-
band and here was one at hand six
months of dutch lessons six months of
dainty half-oriental tenderness of spark-
ling white-toothed laughter and of a warm
pulsing body leaning close to fergusons as
she made corrections on his paper
  he struggled against it to be sure but
he struggled blindly not knowing the
strength of his adversary and he struggled
bondage

in solitude in the end he would have gone
through hells fire for touch of jacquelines
hand
  still because the pennsylvania oil com-
pany forbade its young men to take wives
before they had completed their first three
years in the east he married her secretly
jacqueline did not care she could afford
to wait for social prestige giving up her
position at the office she settled down with
ferguson to simple housekeeping in a small
secluded villa
  no one ever found out about her so
far as the english-speaking colony knew
ferguson lived alone his fellows failing
a dozen times to drag him again to their
festivities finally put him down as a queer
bird
  they let it go at that
  and the boy was deliriously happy
jacqueline along with her compelling
beauty was lighthearted as a child to the
lonely and reserved young fellow she be-
came a source of never-ending joy it
never occurred to him that she was now
for the first time in her life having leisure
to find her true self
  naturally living as he did ferguson
learned dutch with considerable rapidity
fourteen months after his arrival in sura-
baya he was pronounced ready for the road
the bald-headed eagle praised him out-
spokenly
   youre as good as an american john
never believed you englishmen had it in
you
   englishmen ferguson retorted hotly
 read your atlas man im from dundee
  charlie wells laughed
   and youre going to celebes and
borneo
  celebes and borneo on the map the
islands of the eastern indies lie pretty
well bunched but only on the map
actually it takes longer to go from sura-
baya to menado than from new york to
honolulu ferguson found some of his
outlying markets a full five weeks journey
away from headquarters
  but he had to go and he had to go
alone his salary would not permit jac-
queline to accompany him nor did he
dare to take her
  not that there was any reason why he
should hesitate about leaving her behind
her love he knew full well was every bit
as steadfast as his own six months at
the most he would be working his head
off-for jacqueline and jacqueline would
be counting the days until he returned
  so he went away celebes and borneo
long sweltering days on greasy tropical
rivers fever-ridden nights in mountain
towns pleadings and arguments with
apathetic chinese agents weeks of waiting
for tardy steamers and if in samarinda
or toli toli or gorontalo ferguson ran
into cynical americans and britishers who
spoke scornfully of half-castes swore to
their inconstancy he simply laughed to him-
self and knew such men to be fools
  after ten months he returned to sura-
baya jacqueline was nowhere to be found
  ferguson heard of her three times before
he saw her again although each time he
raced after her in horrified dazed increduli-
ty she was seen in malang with a rich
armenian in semarang with a dutch sugar
planter and in tosari with stapleton of
stapleton  moore whose wife was visiting
her parents in san francisco but always
as jacqueline van der bent fergusons
name was never involved
  he heard of her only by chance casually
and each time he raced after her hot
thoughts of murder rioting in his brain but
he never caught up with her and gradually
his fury died jacquelines defection was
too gross he could not commit murder-
for such as she
  stricken to the soul when at last he saw
her in surabaya he tried only to dodge a
meeting
  jacqueline saw him however and came
to him came to him in lighted foyer of
the royal bioscope where her treacherous
beauty shone full upon him but he did
not see it the moment was so unreal so
unworldly that he questioned his own ex-
istence absolute abstraction held him
  jacqueline spoke to him and was gone
and after a long time he remembered prom-
ising to call on her the following afternoon
at the oranje hotel
  he went there at tea-time jacqueline
was alone waiting for him the only diff-

argosy-allstory weekly
erence was in the clothes she now possessed
but they were enough to transform her
completely dazzling dazzling-god she
was beautiful
  she was very frank about the situation
frank and matter-of-fact she was sorry
-sorry like hell john fairguson she
had thought she wanted a husband but
those months alone had taught her differ-
ently she wanted wealth jewels luxury
line clothes very certainly she did not
want a poor husband
   but youve got me was his dull reply
she flashed a startled glance from her
narrow eyes  you would not have me
come back 
   no he said  no not that
   then you must divorce me be sure
i shall do nothing to prevent she leaned
forward with a touch of the tenderness he
knew so well  do that john fairguson
and put me out of your mind-altogether
i am worth nothing else
  put her out of his mind that was easy
he had already put her out of his mind
as completely as he would forget a snake
slain on his threshold and tossed out for
the boys to bury but divorce-
  the company would probably overlook
his infraction of the rule now that the affair
was ended nothing to fear from that
quarter a divorce however ferguson
knew could never be managed with any-
thing like the secrecy that had attended
their marriage his mind shrank from the
prospect of publicity the considerations
which had held his hand from revenge now
filled him with abhorrence at the thought
of court proceedings the situation was
too vile he could never lend his name to
such a thing
   no he said bitterly  count me out
do as you please in the future youll
never see me again
  and the next day war blazed out all
over europe
iv
  ferguson took the first ship home from
surabaya for four years he did his reck-
less best to have his head shot off but in
november iqis he could boast a trunkful
of decorations and not a single scar
  demobilized he still had to live a good
position offered in london and he took it
he had held it about three weeks when
he began to realize that he was torturing
himself every time he looked upon some
straightforward english girl the knowledge
of what he had thrown away stabbed like
a knife into his vitals
  only one thing to do then if his tale
was told if he had lived his life before he
was twenty-eight he must go back where
the fact would not be so constantly thrust
before his eyes nearness to jacqueline
he argued would never again have power to
hurt him he cabled new york and the
pennsylvania oil company received him
with open arms
  in singapore two months later he ran
into the bald-headed eagle that indivi-
dual recently elevated to assistant general
manager accomplished fergusons appoint-
ment to the managership at surabaya and
now at last after two more years the bald-
headed eagle had become general manager
and had cabled for ferguson to come to
singapore as his right-hand man
  during the two years he had spent in
surabaya since the war ferguson had
never once seen jacqueline not that his
wife was not everywhere to be seen her
fame was great in the land her beauty
her conquests were subjects of conversation
wherever men gathered by themselves
  for that reason ferguson had always
steered clear of such places
  his position as manager of the pennsyl-
vania however had demanded that he not
live in seclusion he had got out among
people among the solider members of the
english-speaking community and gradu-
ally the hopelessness that london had in-
spired had drained away
  he had drifted naturally inevitably it
would seem into comradeship with mary
campbell mary was the only unmarried
british girl in surabaya and ferguson
was about the only one of the younger men
who did not worship exclusively at the
simpang bar so they had come to be
often together riding in the gray mornings
along the misty banks of the irrigation
canal trouncing each other at golf or tennis
in the afternoons
                          	a
bondage

  and now-this
  mary campbell loved him the con-
ception shattered all his resolution so
long as he had remained unaware of her
affection it had been possible for him to
contemplate renunciation with a degree of
fortitude he loved her and was happy
to do so but he had no right to love her
so he would simply say nothing about it
and go his way the only honorable
course
  although he approached it considered
it from every angle he constantly rejected
all thought of divorce true he had much
more money now than he had had seven
years before when tragedy had burst upon
his head perhaps a divorce could be man-
aged with a fair amount of secrecy but a
fair amount would not be enough secrecy
would have to be absolute
  not for his sake not because he would
save himself from the ensuing scandal his
love he knew could bear any burden any
sacrifice
  but that was not the whole of it the
fact must ever remain that he had had a
notorious woman as his wife-a woman who
was still notorious and known to the
farthest end of the china coast he could
free himself from her-easily but after-
ward could he ask any such girl as mary
campbell to marry him
  the idea was monstrous he could
never do it no divorce or not divorced
his marriage to jacqueline van der bent
must forever put him outside of all hope
of mary campbell
  to-days discovery however now com-
pletely possessed him loving the girl with
all his heart his love surged in an uncon-
trollable flood as he realized it found
favor
  when the first confusion of the situation
subsided and they were whirling back along
the river-road to surabaya it became more
and more imperative in fergusons mind
that something be done
  mary campbell after a long interval of
silence-a silence that to ferguson was
strained and unnatural-began chatting
about things that had nothing to do with
his going away she did not thus deceive
him indeed her very avoidance of what
    	a
must be the dominant topic warned him
that she was troubled wondering-waiting
perhaps
  he felt an utter cad as he dropped her
at home and ordered the chauffeur to drive
him to his own house
v
  ferguson lived on sumatra street the
garden behind his bungalow sloped down
to the kalimas the golden river after
a late dinner he dragged a big makassar
chair to the railing of his rear veranda
and sat down deliberately to think it
over
  hours of thinking got him nowhere
divorce was out of the question and there
was no other loophole he was imprisoned
walled up as effectually as by brick and
plaster through the folly of his youth un-
less jacqueline died-a remote possibility-
and their secret died with her-
  unless jacqueline died-
  the lights were going out one by one
in the houses along the kalimas it was
getting late the moon had already
dropped below the level of goobeng bridge
and now hung crisscrossed by the bridges
steel supports a stillness gripped every-
thing the utter absence of sound that lies
on a sleeping village but ferguson was
aware of none of these things fascinated
cold his mind was traveling a fearsome
path
  unless jacqueline died why not
god it would only be fair he wanted to
be free-free
  but at last he laughed harshly
   lord no he muttered  i cant do
that
  his face was haggard in the last light
of the moon he stood up wearily to go
into the house and as he did so a motor-
car shot around the corner beside him it
left the driveway came to a stop behind
the row of mdati bushes which screened
his back compound from the street
  ferguson went slowly toward the steps
he stood there feeling a mild curiosity as
to the identity of this midnight visitor
vaguely then he saw the outline of a
womans form coming across the grass

argosy-allstory weekly
  john fairguson
  fergusons immediate sensation was one
of fright of sheer terror he felt cold along
his spine and the back of his head prickled
as though each hair were standing out
straight jacqueline and only a moment
before he had been contemplating how best
he could murder her
  john fairguson
   yes hoarsely
   i want to talk with you so i drove
around back because everybody knows my
car
   very thoughtful of you he managed
to say
  jacqueline laughed  oh for my sake
too
  they stood facing each other in the
darkness a wave of her perfume swept to
the mans senses mingling with the choking
breath of night-blooming melati but fer-
gusons only thought recurring white-hot
was that here was his chance his chance
to be free
   i want to talk with you
   come inside he said shortly
  he preceded jacqueline into his study
switched on one light in his table lamp
then steadily he looked up at her across
his desk
  she was as he had seen her that after-
noon in the oranje hotel the never-chang-
ing superbness of her beauty struck him
with the force of a blow hard glittering
beauty of course and sensual but it was
fresh at the same time ferguson looked
in vain for a hint of evil cunning in her
eyes
  at a glance ferguson noticed that the
shutter was closed on the only window in
the room he walked back and closed the
door after which he motioned jacqueline
to a big leather chair then he sat down
at his desk
   what do you want
   well-i want you to divorce me john
fairguson
  ferguson only stared
    i will explain she went on meeting
his eyes direct and smiling a little  i want
to marry
   oh you want to marry the man
nodded and nodded i see you want
to marry so you came to me to divorce
you-just like that
   of course
  followed a full minute of silence she
wanted a divorce the final unequivocal step
that would put mary campbell out of
fergusons reach his eyes narrowed a
strange harsh laugh sprang unbidden to his
lips
  there was an automatic pistol he knew
in the drawer at his right hand the room
was tightly closed and there were no houses
within seventy-five yards no one would
hear a single shot-or investigate it if they
did hear this was not london a java-
nese policeman would be likely to slink
away from any disturbance in a white mans
house
  she wanted a divorce and one swift
movement only one crook of the finger-
but to shoot a woman-dead-like that
to shoot any one in cold blood
   you will do it john fairguson
   and have the whole far east laughing
at me
   pooh for a month then it is for-
gotten if you had done it seven years
ago no one wouid ever think of it now
but now you must do it
  must he was temporizing and he
knew it still all the time a few cells in
the back of his brain kept rehearsing the
simple motions that would open his path
to freedom
   why yes jacqueline answered with
a little pout  i want to marry you are
a good fellow and will help me we shall
make it very secret
   we cant make it secret people will
find out
   here in surabaya yes but i shall
keep it from the man i am to marry he
is very stupid and directly we are
divorced t shall go with him to europe-
to france
  a red mist of anger swam suddenly into
fergusons vision as easy as that she
cared for nothing for nobody so long as
she came safely out of their predicament
it bothered her not at all to leave shame
and anguish as his portion the very
heartlessness of her scheme made the mans
blood boil
bondage
s
   suppose i refuse to divorce you he
asked sharply
  jacquelines eyes opened wide giving an
impression of hurt surprise
   then you spoil my opportunity you
will not do that
  oh i should be very angry  should
tell everything about us john fairguson
i should tell everything
  that was enough that decided him
very slowly softly ferguson pulled open
the drawer that held his pistol another
second and the fingers oi his right hand
curled around the weapons grip
  with his eyes never leaving jacquelines
dark ones it seemed to him that he could
sense a stiffening through the womans
frame-as though in preparation for a sud-
den action for flight if need be but more
than anything else that stiffening made him
consider the irremediable rigor that would
come when his bullet had accomplished its
mission
  and in that tense appalling second a
saving reflection suddenly entered fer-
gusons mind
  an incredible weakness seized his elbows
and wrists
  what a fool he was murder-and his
hand releasing the pistol as though it were
red-hot trembled so that he shut the drawer
with a slam no god no he would
never go to mary campbell with the stain
of blood on his conscience
  he was beaten he must bow to the in-
evitable whichever way he turned mary
campbell was lost to him whichever way
he turned
  his heart knew the burden of utter de-
pair and he now wanted nothing more
than to get jacqueline out of the house to
rid himself as quickly as possible of her
presence the scent of her perfume stuck
in his nostrils as something contaminat-
ing
  all right he said flatly and he sat
up straight in his chair - ill start it to-
morrow give me your address and the
lawyer can let you know how its coming
along
  jacqueline smiled triumphantly as she
handed a card across the desk-with her
left hand
   you would not have succeeded john
fairguson
  ferguson looked at the woman not un-
derstanding jacqueline lifted her right
hand from beside the big chair in which she
was sitting poised on her fingers glittering
viciously in the dim light quivered a long
slender dagger
   i never miss john fairguson she
lightly remarked  my aim is sure in
the heart in the throat-anywhere and
so quick before you could raise a pistol
from your desk
  ferguson understood and shrugged
   oh yes yes i have no doubt only
go away now after this the lawyer will
attend to everything
   you do not ask whom i am to marry
   no im not interested
  he is a half-caste-like me
   and you love him of course a trifle
grimly
  a sneer curled the womans full red lips
 bah i hate him he loves me-the
fool and oh i have told him such lies
he is very rich
   hm
  the fool yes she could make a fool
out of any man but it lay in his power
to clip her vings would he do it let
jacqueline do her worst let the crash come
openly save this other chap from such a
disillusionment as he himself had known
it was on fergusons  lips to voice his
thoughts when the door suddenly opened
from the veranda
  a man came in shut the door behind
him he was about fergusons age hand-
some dark-skinned with a small black
mustache the light from the lamp shone
full on his face confusing him as he looked
from one to the other of the occupants of
the room there was a savage glitter in
his eyes his breath came fast
   dolph 
  jacquelines shriek filled the four walls
and ferguson sprang to his feet here was
unquestionably jacquelines intended vic-
tim
  for a full thirty seconds no one moved
 so said the intruder at last heavily
in dutch  fortunately i saw your car
-and followed

argosy-allstory weekly
   and now you can follow your nose out
of here ferguson rapped out hotly he
felt a certain sympathy for the half-caste
hut it had to give way to swift indignation
at this unwarranted entry into his house
an absurd melodrama out of the corner
of his eye he could see jacqueline stiffen
as she had done before
  certainty of her guilt was plain on the
man dolphs face he gave ferguson
not one second of attention spitting a
vile name at the woman he reached swiftly
for his hip pocket
  what followed occurred with a speed that
left ferguson gasping the next thing he
knew a flicker of light passed across the
room in front of him
  the half-caste rocked backward a tall
corner bookcase kept him from falling he
made no outcry the only noise was the
clash of broken glass around his feet fer-
guson knew that the man had driven his
shoulder through a pane of the bookcase
door then a spreading circle of blood
leaped out on the breast of dolphs linen
coat
  against that dark spot gleamed the silver
of jacquelines dagger-grip every inch of
the long blade was buried in the half-castes
body with his left hand he plucked feebly
abstractedly at the deadly weapon
   he would have shot me john fairgu-
son came in frantic tones from the woman
you saw that john fairguson jacque-
line sprang hastily from the chair
  ferguson had started toward the wounded
man
  but before he could take two steps
a snarl burst from dolphs lips cursing
jacqueline with his last breath the half-
caste thrust forth his right hand the
thunder of an explosion resounded in the
closed room
  jacqueline dropped as though struck by
lightning and the half-caste smiling slid
down the bookcase to the floor
  sheer horror wrung an exclamation from
ferguson he knelt beside jacqueline
turned her over his fingers tore at the
silk of her gown blood from a bullet wound
over her heart clung warmly to his hand
she was dead beyond any doubt and
dolph was dead a weakness attacked the
survivor he groped his way backward
into the chair jacqueline had occupied
  for a long time he did not move
  at the end of half an hour no one had
come to make inquiries no one would
come
  jacqueline was dead-and their secret
had died with her ferguson was free
he was shocked too and stunned but
during that long half hour of waiting no
process of reasoning had convinced him
that he would do any one any good by re-
vealing his part in the affair
  with quiet determination therefore he
set to work it was a gruesome task but
there was no way he could escape it lift-
ing the two bodies one at a time he carried
them to jacquelines motor-car then he
drove the car two miles out along the river-
road toward goonoong sari and left it
  two hours later he had cleaned up the
last signs of the nights occurrences from
himself and his house and compound he
went to bed
  for three days after that he waited the
double tragedy was just about a three days
wonder the police affer scurrying about
aimlessly fruitlessly put the two deaths
down to a fatal quarrel between the prin-
cipals there was never a word of suspicion
that the quarrel had not taken place where
the bodies were found
  ferguson breathed easier
  on the day before he was to go away
from surabaya he went to mary camp-
bell she met him on her veranda and in
that moment he knew he must forever love
even the ground on which she walked
    ive come to tell you i love you mary
was all he could say
   and i love you her blue eyes met
his with glad trustfulness
   but theres something else ill have
to tell it before i can ask you to marry
me
  mary campbell shook her head
   do you think it can ever bother us
she asked
   it never can bother us-now
    then lets both forget it
  he nodded heart full of wonderment at
her mercy he drew her forward into his
arms

a question answered
for a sickening instant mccartys stout
legs wabbled beneath him then he
drew himself together and pressing
the button of his own flashlight he strode
over the sill
  a strange scene presented itself to his
staring eyes dennis was clinging weakly
to an upright post at the foot of the heavily
carved bed which upheld its canopied top
and orbit himself was lying inert upon his
pillows his firmly molded chin relaxed and
the sunken closed eyes mere blotches of
shadow in the grayish pallor of his face
the rich silk pyjama jacket was open at
his throat and his arms flung above his
head as though helplessness had come upon
him in the effort to protect himself at the
same moment mccarty became aware of
the pungent sweetish odor that assailed his
own nostrils
  chloroform he gasped pointing to
a small bottle which stood upon the bed-
stand  isnt that a towel on the pillow
beside his head throw it into the corner
denny and then get back into the other
room quick
  galvanized into life dennis obeyed re-
trieving his flashlight as he went mccarty
waited only to open the two windows wide
before rejoining him
   arent we going to raise an alarm
dennis demanded excitedly but mccarty
lowered his own voice to a whisper once
more
   we are not to get ourselves accused
were going to beat it out the way we came
as fast as the lord  let us and dont
open your nouth again till we get beyond
the gates sure the devil himself is let
loose
  down the stairs through the pantries and
lower front hall to the card room-the dis-
tance seemed interminable and every foot-
this story began in the argosy-allstory weekly for november 


argosy-allstory weekly
step resounded maddeningly in their nerve-
shaken ears but they did not pause until
they reached the little side door and dennis
had shot the bolts back
   wait till we put on our shoes again
mccarty admonished  theres no room
to do it out in that alley and were safe
enough now but hurry
  shod once more they stole out closing
the door noiselessly behind them and re-
connoitered carefully for the watchman but
he had passed on in the direction of the east
gate and they sped to the opposite one
passing through it just before he turned
  all desire for speech seemed to have left
dennis and they walked northward for sev-
eral blocks before mccarty broke the
silence
   i suppose you think twas queer we
didnt take that heaven-sent opportunity to
search the house without orbit at least to
interrupt us denny but there was no tell-
ing how long hed been under that chloro-
form nor when hed come out of it and we
could not say wed scared away whoever
did it to him or we would not have sneaked
in ourselves
   how do you know he wasnt dead
denniss tone held a volume of reproach
   i saw the chest of him rise and fall
regular with his breathing and a whiff like
that could not put him out for the count
mccarty declared impatiently  didnt
i open the windows on him myself and tell
you to take away the towel that must have
slipped down from off his face
    twas still damp with that stuff den-
nis muttered with a shudder
   and chloroform evaporates quicker
than anything else i know exclaimed his
companion  that shows it must have
been given to him the minute almost be-
fore we went upstairs the sitting room
looked all right to me did you happen to
notice whether anything was upset or not
where he was
   i did not dennis averred  id the
shock of my life when my light flashed over
his face if hes found dead come morning
ill feel as if id murdered him myself and
not a wink will i sleep nor a free breath
will i draw till i know hes all right
  but when mccartys rooms were reached
again and the desultory discussion was re-
newed it was denrils himself in whom ex-
hausted nature first was revealed and he
sank deeply into healthy slumber his
host however sat hunched in his armchair
till dawn smoking innumerable cigars and
staring into the turbid atmosphere of the
familiar room through narrowed eyes as
though they beheld strange and evil things
  he finally stretched himself out wearily
beside dennis however and dropped into
uneasy slumber to be awakened by the
sharp ringing of the telephone when he
turned from it after receiving the frenzied
message it was to find his guest draped
in his own shabby bathrobe waiting with
morbid expectancy for the news
   is orbit dead-
   he is not hes got the inspector fair
wild with his tale of being drugged in the
night and on top of it old benjamin parsons
reports a robbery both the watchmen are
fired temporarily and lads from headquar-
ters put in their place mccarty reported
succinctly  its a nice peaceful day youll
be having of it at the fire house while i
face the music
  dennis gulped with relief
   was anything took from orbits house
did the inspector say
   hed no time but im thinking hell
be on his way here as soon as he can pacify
the two latest victims of outrage there in
the mall moreover if youre going to
stop for brian to shave you after breakfast
it will be a miracle that youre not late
dennis disappeared promptly into the
bathroom and mccarty gathered up the
documents and torn encyclopedia page pur-
loined from the parsons house and stowed
them carefully awav before making his own
hasty toilet they ate a sketchy breakfast
together at the accustomed restaurant and
then separated mccarty returning to his
rooms with a sheaf of newspapers to await
the coming of his superior
  from the front page of the first paper
the pictured face of horace goddard stared
out at him big eyed and wistfully alert and
the caption beneath announced that mr
eustace goddard offered twenty-five thou-
sand dollars reward for information which
would lead to the recovery of his son
annihilation

  a second article brief but placed in sig-
nificant juxtaposition to it declared that no
further progress had been made in the in-
vestigation into the death of the valet
alfred hughes who had succumbed to the
effects of the little known poison physostig-
mine soon after leaving the residence of
his employer mr henry orbit in the new
queens mall six days before but the au-
thorities expected to make an important
arrest in connection with it in the imme-
diate future
  inspector druets impatient ring brought
mccarty quickly to his feet and as the for-
mer sprang up the stairs lie flung open the
living room door
   mac what the devii have you been
doing
   me inspector mccartys face was a
study but he had misunderstood
   yes why werent you on the job
theyve raised hell in the mail last night
while i was chasing up some false clews
about the goddard case and i havent laid
eyes on you since the medical examiners
assistant arrived at orbits yesterday
   ive been getting a bit of sleep this
morning mccarty replied evasively
 did you see parsons you told me hed
been robbed-did he say what was stole
from him
   no thats the queer part of it when
he phoned to headquarters he was anxious
to talk but as soon as i got to his house
he began to hedge a whole pane had been
removed from one of the rear windows and
the telephone and kip alarm system wires
were cut but he couldnt show me that any-
thing in his study had been disturbed al-
though he insisted that some documents
had been stolen from his filing case he would
tell me nothing about them except that
some were notes for a book he was writing
and the rest of a highly personal nature
   if twas nothing of money value id
not be bothering about it mccarty sug-
gested hurriedly  he got off light con-
sidering whats happened at other houses on
that block look at orbit wasnt he
drugged besides to say nothing of the mur-
der committed there
   yes but nothing was stolen from him
he tells me he took a bromide to try to
sleep for the shock of the girls death in
the afternoon had about made him go to
pieces and he was just dozing off when he
thought he heard something in the room
he couldnt be sure and before he could
make a move a towel was clapped over his
face the next thing he knew he woke
up mighty sick
   he would have thought the whole thing
was a nightmare only there was the towel
saturated with chloroform in a corner of the
room the bottle itself on a stand beside his
bed and the windows open wider than he
had left them the rest of the household
including sir philip devereux and his valet
harry blake werent even disturbed the
side door opening from the card room was
found unbolted this morning though ching
lee swears he fastened it as usual last
night and the telephone wires outside the
house were cut just as parsonss were
   well if orbit has recovered and noth-
ing was taken theres been small harm done
there either mccarty commented add-
ing  is sir philip going to stay on at
orbits
   he sails saturday i should think hed
find orbits kind of hospitality a little stren-
uous although he seems to be a fine old
sport mac what are we to do im about
at the end of my rope and though the hap-
penings lac night dont mean actual trag-
edy they snow how little the scoundrels
back of these crimes are afraid of being
found out
  in the clear morning light the inspectors
keen lundly face seemed to have aged
years and mccartys heart smote him
   oh i dont know sir he said  if
just papers that were useful to no one but
himself were taken from parsons and noth-
ing at all from orbit maybe the wretch just
pulled off those two stunts to throw you off
the track of the two murders and the kids
disappearance have you heard from mar-
tin
   hes back and blaisdell the artist
came with him blaisdelps at goddards
now offering whatever help he can give
but he hasnt seen horace since the boy
came to his studio to bid him good-by i
talked to him and id swear hes on the
level its the most infernal mystery-

argosy-allstory weekly
   has the autopsy been performed yet on
that girl lucette mccartys tones had
lowered
   just an hour ago mac its got the
whole medical bureau going the exam-
iner agrees with dr allonby but he cant
go any further the kind of gas that was
used is a new one on them deadlier than
an- sort the war produced and theyve sent
to washington to find out if anything is
known of it there thanks inspector
druet accepted the cigar which the other
proffered and after it was alight he added
 fluorine gas is one of its component
parts-
   fluorine mccarty paused with the
match halfway to his own cigar
    yes but there are other properties with
it fluorine burns you know but there was
no trace of that on the girls face although
her lungs were seared how it was ever
forced on her is beyond me and the chief
is raging like a caged bear
  he shook his head dejectedly  if we
dont show results mighty soon im due for
a transfer and that means the beginning of
the end but i dont feel that so keenly
as i do my sense of failure i had a chance
for quick action when that valet was poi-
soned but now that little boy and the fine
young french girl- god it seems as
though i had been criminally negligent
   not a bit of it inspector  mccarty
exclaimed earnestly  its just like i was
saying to denny were up against the
worst case and the cleverest murdering
devil in the history of the department and
well not be laying him by the heels by
working along behind him its from what
hes going to pull in the future that well
get him and then only through outguessing
him wholl be the next thats the ques-
tion weve got to answer
  when after threshing the situation over
thoroughly once more the inspector finally
took his departure mccarty put in a long
hour studying the papers taken from par-
sons filing case the collection of reports
evidently transcripts from court and police
records besides the names of jennie ma-
lone chris porter and the boy danny
sayre comprised those of bert ferris han-
nah cray and bessie dillon ferris had
been convicted of insurance fraud but par-
sons had annotated the report  great
provocation through need for dependents
hannah cray was a shoplifter and bessie
dillon a confidence worker after the
names of both women had been written
 reform assured
  the manuscript proved to be a compila-
tion of scattered and disconnected notes
relative to various methods in modern war-
fare together with lengthy diatribes
against the sin of organized killing mc-
carty had little patience to peruse it the
references to fluorine gas gave merely the
formula and effect
  without glancing again at the article on
the calabar bean mccarty put the torn
page away with the other papers but
slipped the odd silvery bookmark in his
pocket the violent rainstorm which he had
already combatted on the way to the res-
taurant and back was still raging with un-
abated fury taking a stouter umbrella
he clapped on his hat locked the door be-
hind him and descended to the street
there he was pounced upon by a young
man with a shock of very red hair who
had been lying in wait for him in m
girards shop doorway
   hey mac got you at last what
brought inspector druet to you so early
this morning anything new turned up in
that merry little three-ring circus of crime
that is giving a continuous performance
under your noses over at the new queens
mall
  the taunt was a shrewdly calculated one
but mccarty grinned affably
   i see your bulletin this morning has
only the story of the girls death yesterday
afternoon jimmie thats old stuff now
jimmie ballard opened his eyes and
ducked confidentially under the shelter of
mccartys umbrella
   for the love of pete has there been
more doing he gasped  come across
mac you know im always ready to do
you a good turn whats up now
   we-ell -mccarty assumed an air of
troubled indecision- of course theres no
one between those gates would breathe a
word of it to you newspaper guys and if i
was to tell you about the two robberies it
annihilation

might get back to me not being regularly
on the force any more id not want the
inspector to think-
   two robberies jimmies eyes shone
 what a beat mac let me get the story
through to the shop and well have an extra
out in half an hour ill keep you out of
it i swear-
   all right then if youll do something
for me after mccarty suddenly reached
into his pocket and drew out parsons book-
mark  find out what the devil is this
made of and phone me at my rooms to-
night mind you dont mention it in your
story or never another tip will you get from
me now heres what happened
  he repeated briefly the inspectors ver-
sion of the incidents of the previous night
and then well satisfied he continued on
his way it led him on a long and diversi-
fied path through that days storm to
headquarters the public library the citys
mortuary and the laboratories of a great
university up on the heights for the first
time since the inception of the strangely
complex case he steered clear of the mall
it was not until darkness had fallen that
he returned to his rooms rain soaked and
weary
  unlocking the door he stepped inside
the living room and mechanically felt for
the light switch in the wall the button
clicked with no resultant glow from ithe
side brackets and desk at the same mo-
ment he lifted his nose in the air and sniffed
sharply
  some one had been in his rooms again
his lights had been tampered with for
they were on the same current as the house
next door and a ray from there was even
now streaking faintly across the airshaft
past his bedroom window moreover there
had been nothing wrong with his switch the
night before somebody was laying for
him
  aware that the feeble gas jet in the hall
below was yet strong enough to silhouette
him vaguely in its glimmering half light
he pulled the door shut behind him and
whipped out his revolver
   is anybody here his bull-throated
demand cut the silence  come on you
white livered son of a gun and ill give
  you the fight of your life if theres a hu-
man ear in this room hear me
  he waited tense and tingling his own
ears strained to catch the slightest sound
but none came-no stir of a foot no whis-
per of breathing broke the utter stillness in
which the echo of his voice had died away
after a minute that seemed ages long doubt
changed to certainty
  somebody had been there and gone but
had they gone far what had they done
to his rooms that he was not meant to see
what had they left behind them for him to
blunder into in the darkness had a trap
been set for him under his own roof
  mccarty pressed his lips grimly together
his square jaw outthrust and keeping his
revolver still cocked and ready in his right
hand he reached behind him with the other
and propped his umbrella against the wall
then half stooping he advanced a step
straight before him in the direction of the
fireplace with infinite caution and deli-
cacy of one in a maze of live wires his
left hand groped about in the pitch black-
ness surrounding him but encountered only
empty air he took another step forward
then another
  at last at the height of about his mid-
dle his fingers touched a fine cord drawn
across his path so tautly that it vibrated
like a harp string beneath a contact as light
as a mere breath running his fingers
along it with the light touch of a drifting
feather he moved to the left until the cord
made a sharp turn around the corner of his
heavy desk and started forward once more
now he was facing again toward the fire-
place but the left side of it and his guiding
line was rising it must be at the height
of the mantel now he must almost have
reached the shelf itself
  moving even more cautiously inch by
inch his fingers traveling with still greater
delicacy he followed the cord to the corner
of the mantel and there came in contact
with what appeared to be a pulley rigged
ingeniously over the clamp of a portable
lamp bracket which had never been fastened
there before
if the cord were broken something on
the other end of that pulley running under
the mantel would drop and then what

argosy-allstory weekly
would happen would the house be blown
to bits in the explosion of some infernal
machine or something fall on him from
above it had obviously been intended
that he should break that string but why
had it been taken for granted that finding
his lights out of commission he would walk
straight forward from the doorway instead
of perhaps around the wall-
  his matches of course he wouldnt be
supposed to stop and fumble in his clothes
for any he might be carrying when a whole
box of them were where he always kept
them there on the mantel before him
twas from the mantel itself then or
just under it that trouble could be looked
for if the weight on the other end of that
pulley dropped and that trouble would
occur somewhere in a line with the door-
way
  shifting his revolver to his left hand
mccarty felt with the right for the weight
dangling from the end of the pulley his
compressed lips widened at the corners in a
grim smile as he followed it up again and
along under the edge of the mantel until
his fingers met the cold ring of a revolver
muzzle
  so that was the answer when the
weight dropped that cord as line and
strong as fishline which he could feel wound
around the trigger would snap back and
from that muzzle would streak forth a death
message certain and sure
  but not while mccarty knew it drop-
ping his own revolver into his pocket he
swiftly and skillfully disengaged the cord
from about the trigger of the other and
drew it from the cradle of wire which had
been strung over two nails driven into the
under side of the mantelshelf placing it
upon the mantel within easy reach he
found it but the work of a moment to jerk
down the lamp bracket and its improvised
pulley break the haul in the cord and
throw the whole mechanical death trap into
the empty fireplace
  then another thought came to him sup-
pose the party who had planned that little
surprise for him were waiting about in the
immediate vicinity near enough to have
seen him come in close enough at hand to
hear the anticipated report wouldnt they
  be likely to come then to see the result for
themselves wouldnt that be their next
logical move
  their next move since he entered the
room mccarty had been too busy to won-
der why this reception had been arranged
for him but now a light broke over his
mind and he all but chuckled aloud hed
been asking himself and denny a question
for the last twenty-four hours and now by
the lord it was answered for him
  but why should they be disappointed
why shouldnt they hear that shot after
all and in coming to investigate reveal
their own identity there was nothing
above the ceiling but the loft and noth-
ing above that again but the roof and the
clouds that were pouring down rain that
minute with a sudden impulse mccarty
seized the revolver from the mantel aimed
it straight up into the air and fired then
he jumped nimbly aside and crouched be-
hind the great armchair
  the echo of the shot had scarcely died
away when there came a terrific banging
upon the entrance door below this time
a hoarse chuckle did force its way from mc-
cartys throat
  that was their game was it to pretend
they were just passing and raise all the
hell they could getting in so as to attract
attention to the fact that they came after
the shot was fired let them bang away
and break the door down the one whod
come up those stairs would be the one who
had rigged up that murder machine
  the banging gave place to a moment of
silence and then came a mighty crash
followed by another and another till at
iength the door fell inward with a snap of
the lock and a rending jar some one sob-
bing harshly chokingly came bounding and
scrambling up the stairs preceded by a
wildly darting flash light which played
under the living room door then that door
also was flung wide the light swrept about
and a broken voice in the throes of mental
agony howled dolorously
   mac for the love of god whats
happened to you
  mccarty came out sheepishly from be-
hind the chair
   ive been handling revolvers since first
annihilation

i went on the cops denny with never a
mischance but when the lights went out
on me just now all of a sudden whilst i was
cleaning this ill be damned if it didnt go
off in my hand
chapter xvii
forewarned
denniss lacerated emotions were
soothed with difficulty after an old
oil lamp was resurrected from the
store closet and lighted he seated himself
for a pipe and a chat but the shock had
disorganized him beyond concentration on
the case and he departed early for the
fire house
  mccarty had carefully kept his bulk be-
tween his visitor and the sight of what lay
in the fireplace the moment denny went
away he removed the paraphernalia of the
death dealing device and locked it in his
bedroom closet beneath a pile of old boots
together with the revolver this had proved
on examination to be a replica of his own
old service gun how could his would-be
assassin have come into possession of a
 police positive a thirty-eight manufac-
tured for the department alone
  while he was pondering this the tele-
phone rang and jimmie ballards voice came
to him over the wire
   say mac do you know what that was
you handed me to-day a silver leaf
   it looked kind of like a leaf and there
was a silvery tinge to it jimmie but j
thought it was made of flat plush mc-
carty replied  im no wiser than i was
before what is it
   a leaf from an african silver tree of a
species that grows most plentifully on table
mountain just back of cape town  heres
no telling how old it is for they last for-
ever if theyre not handled too much
where did you get it and what has it to do
with that little affair you and i were talking
about this morning
   not a thing in the world mccarty
avowed hastily  tis just something i
picked up ill be thankful if youll put it
in an envelope and mail it to me special de-
livery though
  all right jimmie laughed of
course it isnt important when youve got
to have it by special and you were willing
to trade the best beat of the year for in-
formation about it but give me the dope on
it one jump ahead of the other boys and
i wont ask any more did you see our
extra some pippin wasnt it
  mccarty cut short the youthful jimmies
enthusiasm he had to stand with his back
squarely to the door to talk into the phone
and he didnt know when his mysterious
visitor might return that shot had mirac-
ulously not aroused the neighborhood but
undoubtedly that was because of the noise
of wind and rain would the author of his
little surprise have sufficient strength of
mind to remain away and wait to see if the
morning papers held any account of the
possible tragedy
  he would if he was one and the same
with the human fiend who had brought all
those horrors to pass in the mall and that
mccarty was morally convinced of he
told dennis and the inspector too that it
would be only by outguessing him and an-
ticipating who his next victim was scheduled
to be that they could hope to solve the mys-
tery now he grinned to himself little had
he thought then who was elected
  but the event of the evening made one
fact manifest the man was afraid he
was beginning to show weakness his armor
was cracking hs nerve was giving way
the desperate chance he had taken of being
discovered at his work the very elaborate-
ness of the scheme itself told of the effort
made in a frenzy of guilty apprehension to
wipe out one of those who represented the
law
  yet the mighty brain which had con-
ceived and carried to a successful conclu-
sion two such strange crimes as the mur-
ders to say nothing of making away with
the child horace would be more than a
match for the present situation having
known his first failure he would be doubly
on the alert and wary mccarty had drawn
his fire and in all probability there would
be a cessation of crimes in the mall while
he gave his attention to those who threat-
ened to thwart his hideous purposeless
activities

argosy-allstory weekly
  the storm raged even more fiercely as
the hour grew late for more reasons than
one mccarty was reluctant to venture forth
for his forgotten dinner he unearthed a
battered percolator tinned meat and crack-
ers and made a light meal retiring to bed
at last with his revolver beneath the pillow
  when he awakened a dark day had brok-
en he lay for a time listening to the wind
roaring down the chimney and the rain driv-
ing in sheets against the windows while he
formed an immediate plan he must work
alone for denny would be on duty again
for twenty-four hours straight from nine
oclock he welcomed this fact for if there
were to be any further attempts made upon
him the faithful denny must not share the
danger it would be just his bum luck
to walk into a trap not meant for him
  as for himself mccarty meant to give
his adversary every opportunity to try
again as he shaved and dressed his blood
raced as in the old days with joy of the
contest yet now for the first time in his
career he was hunted not hunter he had
in a twinkling changed places with the
arch murderer and child stealer the
thought gave added zest to the problem of
the future he was leaving for his accus-
tomed restaurant when the telephone
shrilled and he paused before taking down
the receiver
  his visitor of the night before could
already have learned from the papers that
his attempt had failed but what if he
were ringing up now to be sure that the
event had not actually occurred and re-
mained as yet undiscovered would he be-
tray himself by surprise at the sound of
his intended victims voice
  mccarty unhooked the receiver waited a
moment and then called in a sudden hearty
tone
   hello
   am i addressing ex-roundsman mc-
carty the voice which came to him was
elderly and formal and as he replied in the
affirmative he was certain he had never
heard it before
   inspector druet suggested that i tele-
phone and ask you for an interview on a
strictly private matter mr mccarty this
is benjamin parsons speaking of number
seven new queens mall his tone be-
trayed not the slightest emotion can
you tell me when you will be at liberty
to come to me
   in one hour mr parsons mccarty
responded promptly  tis about what
happened night before last
   yes there was a note of finality in
the quick firm monosyllable  in ar hour
mr mccarty
   the click of a distant receiver came to his
ears and mccarty went out with a puzzled
frown had the inspector an inkling as
to the identity of parsonss  burglar  and
was he passing the buck
  thrust half under his door he found an
envelope with a special delivery stamp
jimmie ballard had kept his word and re-
turned the silver leaf mccarty slipped it
into his pocket and went out into the down-
pour but his thoughts were almost imme-
diately diverted from it by the italian news-
vendor on the corner an acquaintance of
many years standing
  you on da job again white teeth
gleamed in the friendly swarthy counte-
nance  diss-a pape say you gonna fin
da guy wat murd da french-a girl 
  it was the bulletin and jimmie ballards
idea of a joke was to announce the rumor
that former roundsman timothy mccarty
whose achievements in the department had
been unique and notable had been reat-
tached to the detective bureau for special
investigation in connection with the crime
wave in the new queens mall important
developments might be expected shortly
  mccarty passed it by with a grunt then
his eye was caught by a brief paragraph
lower down on die page and he stood still
unheeding the rain which streamed down
his neck from his tilted umbrella it was
a bald statement that george radley the
poisoner who escaped from sing sing a
month before had been found wandering
in a hopelessly demented condition on the
upper east side and would undoubtedly
be committed to matteawan the clothing
he wore was being traced in an effort to
locate the possible accomplices to his escape
  with a nod to the news vendor mccarty
hurried on at last while he awaited his
order at the little restaurant he gave him-
annihilation

self up to reflection was that why par-
sons had sent for him had he learned
that the escaped prisoner received aid from
beneath his roof
  he ate hastily and then made all speed
to the new queens mall where just within
the gate he ran into inspector druet
   youve heard from parsons the latter
asked
  mccarty nodded
   he said you told him to send for me
whatever for sir his tone was blandly
innocent  what can i tell the old gentle-
man about his lost papers
   its what hell tell you if you can get
it out of him i cant confessed his su-
perior  hes got something up his sleeve
all right and if he werent such a well
known character id think he guessed more
about that robbery than he was willing to
say the other one who was holding out
on us came across last night but it isnt
going to help any except to remove one
more possibility
   who was it demanded mccarty
   eustace goddard the only thing that
has kept him and his wife both going dur-
ing these three days since the boy disap-
peared was their own private suspicion that
he had been kidnaped for ransom and would
be held safely until the exchange could be
made but now that hope has gone the
man they thought had taken horace away
was a former business associate of god-
dards down and out now he applied to
goddard for financial help it seems at a
time when it would have saved him when
it was refused he threatened to make god-
dard pay if he stripped him of the most
precious thing he had
  goddard has been quietly looking for
him since the trouble came and expecting
him hourly to make a demand for a large
sum that was why he was willing to
offer such a huge reward last evening
however he ran him to earth and found out
that the poor devil had been ill in a sani-
tarium for months and didnt know any-
thing about horace mrs goddard is al-
most insane-allonby is attending her-
and goddard himself is nearly as bad i
can only put him off with the same old
promises and bunk look over there now
thats the boys shepherd dog max hes
grieving himself to death they tell me
mac if we dont do something soon-
   well be sitting tight and let the other
fellow show his hand the guy thats been
pulling all these murders and such
  they had passed down the block together
toward the parsons house and as he spoke
mccarty glanced across the street to the
court beside the goddards the slim
smooth coated shepherd dog was pacing
restlessly up and down with the slinking
mechanical movement of a beast in cap-
tivity his swaying head hung low and tail
drooped
  the inspector followed his companions
gaze
   trafford says he tried to coax max to
go for a walk but the dog wont go fur-
ther than that from the house theyre
one-man creatures that breed and the boy
was his god if you can get anything out
of the old gentleman that looks like straight
dope phone me at the medical examiners
office
  he went on and mccarty ascended the
steps of the parsons residence and rang the
bell his summons was replied to after
some little delay by a youth who carried
himself smartly if awkwardly in his pages
uniform the bright if somewhat weak
face seemed abnormally pale however and
his sharp eyes shifted in a scared fashion
   names mccarty the newcomer an-
nounced briefly  mr parsons expects
me
  yes sir the youths tone was al-
most servile  you can go right back to
his study sir ill show you
  he led the way to the room which mc-
carty had already visited surreptitiously
two nights before and knocked on the door
   come in the same dignified elderly
voice which had sounded over the telephone
answered the rapping and a man rose slow-
ly from behind the desk as they entered
  he was tall and powerfully built with
a keen intellectual face softened by warm
gray eyes and a well molded mouth sensi-
tive yet firm his finely shaped head was
covered with a shock of snow white hair as
long as a mane and his old-fashioned high
stock and severely cut black coat made

argosy-allstory weekly
him resemble a figure from the past he
looked to mccartys eyes os though he
might have stepped out of one of the frames
in his own portrait gallery but there was
no suggestion of a pose about him with-
out sound or gesture he appeared to domi-
nate the room and his caller felt almost
abashed in his presence
  what would the old gentleman think if
he knew the actual burglar stocd before
him mccarty could feel his honest face
grow hot but he held his chin a trifle higher
after all parsons had known about fluorine
gas and powdered calabar bean hed a
bunch of crooks in his house and knew it
and when his notes had been taken he
didnt feel ike coming clean about them
he might have a bit of explaining to do
himself
   lieutenant mccarty sir the eleva-
tion in rank was patent flattery and mc-
cartys eyes twinkled as benjamin parsons
bowed
   that will do danny mr mccarty
he added as the page boy withdrew  i
have asked you to come here because your
inspector is occupied with matters of graver
import to the little community in the mall
from your question over the telephone this
morning i gather you have been informed
of the occurrence here on wednesday
night
   yes mr parsons mccarty replied
 your house was entered by way of the
rear window wasnt it and some papers
taken as i heard it the wires were cut
outside and a pane of glass knocked out
   an interior alarm system of my own
was also very cleverly disconnected so that
it would not register in my bedroom but
wont you sit down
  a slender patrician blue veined hand
waved to a chair and mccarty obeyed as
though it had been a command  all this
is as unimportant as is the identity oi the
intruder or his identity would be if he had
come merely for gain like the usual house-
breaker but this he was not articles of
value were practically within reach of his
hand-gold and silver plate ivories and
bronzes and ceramics which would have
meant a fortune to the ordinary burglar
they remained undisturbed while the docu-
ments he searched for and found could be
of no possible pecuniary benefit to him
  mr parsonss language and choice of
phrase would have seemed stilted and pe-
dantic had it not been for the pcrfect ease
and lack of mannerism with which he spoke
and his seriously intent eyc-s were fastened
on mccarty in steady gaze which the lat-
ter found somehow disconcerting he
cleared his throat nervously
   the inspector told me twas notes for a
book that was missing and some other
papers that was personal he remarked
   personal to others than myself i regret
to say mr parsons shook his head
 that is why i did not go into particulars
at first discovery which taken in connec-
tion with the rest leaves me no choice
the personal documents removed from this
filing case over here related to the unfortu-
nate past history of several people whom
i count among my friends it would be un-
just to give publicity to them now much
less to permit these records to remain in un-
worthy hands
   the manuscript of my book is perhaps
small loss to the world but it is the result
of years of profound thought and research
i may add that it was intended as a mes-
sage an appeal for universal peace and i
had dwelt in detail upon the horrors of the
last war describing in full the methods em-
ployed by man to destroy his fellows i am
stating this because one of the weapons
so described was fluorine gas and the for-
mula was given fluorine gas has been
mentioned in the papers in connection with
the sad death of the young nurse across
the street but i did not even think of the
coincidence until i made a further discovery
last night
    what was it mccarty felt that the
question was expected of him although he
well knew what was coming was the old
gentleman the grand character he appeared
or as shrewd as they make them and play-
ing safe he could have blushed for his
own suspicious mind but parsons called
the crooks his  friends  and was trying to
protect them what the devil did it all
mean
   when your inspector first called upon
me to make certain inquiries last week at
annihilation

the time a man-servant-from the same
house as that in which the young girl passed
away-also died he told me of the poison
believed to have been used physostigmine
 calabar bean mccarty nodded
   quite so i had never heard of it as it
happened and i looked it up in some books
of reference i have books in common use
in every home of intelligent interest i
was called away before i had finished read-
ing the articles and marked the page that
page mr mccarty has been torn from
my encyclopedia and this could only have
been done on wednesday evening
  the gentle yet dominating voice had con-
tinued in its level perfectly controlled
monotone mccarty looked down at the
floor but felt impelled to raise his eyes
again if only the old gentleman would
look away for a minute
   it seems like a queer sort of burglar
that would tear a page out of a book he
could find anywhere and the fact that it
was an article about calabar bean and
the notes on fluorine gas gone too- the
words stuck in mccartys throat but he
forced himself to go on  why should he
have took them just from here when the
damage was done with the both of them
and how did he know where to get them
anyway
    have been asking myself those ques-
tions but i cannot answer them however
i am convinced that those two coincidences
are more than coincidences and it is my
duty to report them
   yes of course mccarty shuffled one
foot  mr parsons whats become of your
butler chris porter-roberts he called
himself here
  he had launched the question with delib-
erate abruptness but the gray eyes did not
waver
   you knew of his identity the record
of his misfortune was one of those taken
from my filing case
   i recognized him and he made a certain
confession to me the other day mccarty
returned the gaze with interest now and he
saw mr parsons start slightly a faint flush
rising in the smooth pallor of his cheeks
   a confession christopher was a brok-
en man subjected to a persecution which
would have been unfair even if he were
guilty of the charge for which he had suf-
fered imprisonment but i am convinced
of his absolute innocence he asserted vig-
orously  a grave miscarriage of justice
had been committed i could not restore
to him the years which our penal system
had taken from him but i was endeavoring
to help him get on his mental and moral
feet again to win back his self-respect
mr mccarty if christopher made any sup-
posed confession it must have been wrung
from him by coercion innocent or guilty
he has paid the penalty the state de-
manded
   sure for complicity in that poisoning
case if thats what you mean but twas not
that he confessed mr parsons id like to
ask you something- mccarty bent for-
ward  if a guy-i mean a man-was
sent up and escaped and you thought he
was innocent would you think it your duty
to hide him or turn him over to the law
again
   i should deliver him to the authorities
the answer came without an instants hesi-
tation  personal opinion cannot be al-
lowed to weigh against the mandates of
our laws otherwise our whole social fabric
would centuries ago have been undermined
the individual must be submerged in the
collective body if civilization is to endure
but why do you ask
   you knew that radley the fellow sen-
tenced with porter escaped a month ago
and that he was caught last night
   i knew that he had escaped but not
that he was recaptured mr parsons
spoke in oddly shocked accents  the
newspapers doubtless have an account of it
but i was too disturbed in mind this morn-
ing to glance at them where was the un-
fortunate man found
   not where he was last sunday mr
parsons mccarty retorted significantly
 hes supposed to be crazy now so hell go
to the asylum instead of back up the river
but he wasnt crazy last sunday nor the
week and more before that when he laid
hid in the empty house next door here fed
from your table and cared for by some one
in your house that was porters con-
fession and im asking you where is he

argosy-allstory weekly
   he has gone parsons rested his el-
bow on his desk and shielded his eyes with
his hand  i never suspected this chris-
topher laid the table for breakfast as usual
this morning and arranged the mail and
the newspapers it must have been then
that he saw the account of radieys capture
and run away panic-stricken that he might
fall into the hands of ihe law again i
have thought that he seemed more deeply
troubled this week if he had only come
to me and let me convince him of his higher
duty i have failed with him-failed
  deep distress throbbed with a note of
pain in his tone but mccarty persisted
dryly
   thats as may be sir he left about
the time the papers carne that  be
around eight oclock was it before or
after you phoned to me that you knew of
it
  mr parsonss hand fell
   just before i knew no reason for his
departure and he left no word but the
condition of his room showed hurried flight
it was then that i decided to place myself
unreservedly in your hands
   because of that missing dope about
fluorine gas and calabar bean and his own
past history mccarty demanded  be-
cause hed already been convicted of
poison-
  stop mr parsons rose  christo-
pher was innocent  that old charge and
he was equally innocent of the crimes which
have been committed this past week he
was mistaken in his sense of duty but not
a murderer
chapter xviii
checkmate
mccarty left the parsons house a
few minutes later his mind a chaos
of conflicting impressions with the
sonorous dignified tones still ringing upon
his ear and the deeply concerned gaze yet
seemingly bent upon him beniamin par-
sons appeared the epitome of rectitude and
righteousness but had he been as certain
of porters innocence as he claimed and was
he as ignorant of where he had gone
  he crossed the street to orbits house and
glanced again into the court between that
and goddards max was still there but
he had lain down as though exhausted and
ills ribs glistening with the rain showed
pitifully gaunt why didnt they take the
poor fellow in mccarty stopped and spoke
coaxingly to him the dog slowly rolled
his lack luster eyes upon him but made no
other response
 for a long minute mccarty stood
thoughtfully regarding him and then at last
continued on his way but there was a curi-
ously absent look upon his face
  ching lee admitted him and took him to
the library where he had first been received
a small fire of some strange peatlike fuel
was burning on the hearth sending out iri-
descent flames and a faint pervasive odor
as of sandalwood before it orbit was seat-
ed with a stout florid healthy looking
gray haired man in tweeds
   good morning mccarty i rather
thought that you or the inspector would
look in on me this morning orbit turned
to his guest sir philip this is mccarty
the official who is working with inspector
druet on the investigation into this hideous
mystery which seems to involve nearly all
of us here in the mall
  sir philip devereux nodded to the ex-
roundsman in cordial democracy
  shockin affair this shockin he
commented  here for a little private chat
with mr orbit ill leave you-
  no dont go sir philiporbit de-
murred smilingly  you know all the cir-
cumstances and mccarty and i havent
anything private to discuss i hope hes
brought me some news you heard about
what happened to me the other night
   i did that mccarty nodded  what
do you think twas done for if nothing was
taken
  - havent the remotest idea sit down
here by the fire man youre soaked
through orbit added hospitably ill
have ching lee bring you a touch of some-
thing from my private stock-
   xo thank you mr orbit ive a twinge
of the gout now and then though you
mightnt think it mccarty explained
speciously  i just dropped bv to see if
                             a
annihilation

youd thought of anything to add to what
you told the inspector about the chloro-
forming
   nothing the whole thing happened so
quickly and the impressions left on my mind
were so vague that  am afraid i can be of
little use to you one thing seems cer-
tain the fellow didnt intend me to die
from the effect of it since he stopped to
open the windows and throw away the
cloth he had used to anaesthetize me the
incident is absolutely inexplicable except on
the supposition that his only intention was
to terrorize me and that is really too ab-
surd to consider
   it was an outrage declared sir philip
suddenly  damme it passes belief the
chap must be a fiend-or mad what ob-
ject could he have in killing poor hughes
i say there was a valet for you then
the girl too that poison gas theory seems
to be bally rot to me too utterly impossible
with you there in the room okl son but she
is dead isnt she there you are
  he leaned back in his chair and puffed
thoughtfully at his cigar his host turned
to mccarty with a faint hint of amusement
in his eyes but it was quickly overshadowed
by sadness again
   the girl is dead poor creature and i
cannot help feeling that the blame in some
way rests at my door for i invited her in
however her death was brought about the
child escaped though we have that to be
thankful for we are none of us safe here
on the mall while the murderer is free to
come and go in our houses at will killing
with impunity whenever the horrible im-
pulse comes to him i was reluctant to
offer my hospitality to sir philip under
these harrowing circumstances but he was
willing to abide by the consequences
  ripping experience the baronet
nodded again  sorry im sailing to-mor-
row like nothing better than to stop and
see it through old chap over the way
was robbed the same night i hear any
clues left there mccarty
  there was no hint of sarcasm in his
tone but mccarty flushed darkly then
he darted a quick glance at the questioner
and a slow smile dawned the britisher
was trying to get his goat
   	a
   yes sir the same as here he replied
 mr orbit youve that chloroform bottle
the inspector says twas found on a stand
beside your bed
   ching lee has it i believe would
you like to see it he rang the bell with-
out waiting for a reply  the cloth used
was a towel from my own bathroom its
evident that the fellow was familiar with
the house but how he got in that side
door leading from the card room if ching
lee really bolted it as usual the night be-
fore- oh ching lee
  the butler had appeared silently in the
doorway and now orbit addressed him in a
rapid patter of chinese ching lee as im-
passive and wooden of countenance now
as before the tragedy bowed and departed
mccarty turned once more to orbit
   what time was it as near as you can
figure that you were doped
   i should say around two oclock in the
morning perhaps a trifle before sir philip
and i sat up till after midnight playing
chess and when i retired i tried for more
than an hour to sleep before i took a bro-
mide things grew hazy after that and i
dont know how long i dozed before i was
conscious of some one in the room
   you got no whiff of anything else be-
fore the chloroform hit you mccarty
asked  no smell of a pipe or cigar if
the guy was a smoker maybe
   i smoke so constantly myself that i
would scarcely have noticed it even if there
had been time and i were fully awake
orbit raised his brows  you smoke your-
self mccarty could you have detected it
 sure mccarty stated the fact mod-
estly  ive not the nose denny has but
tis easy to tell the smell of a cigar from
a pipe even if its only hanging about the
clothes of a person a rich full flavored
cigar with a body to it leaves a scent that
a man will travel with whether he gets
it himself or not
   denny orbit repeated  oh you
mean your associate riordan yes i re-
member he detected the odor of that small
blaze here a week ago when the monkey
upset the cigar lighter in my room odd
faculty that eh sir philip
   jolly i fancy i only wish i had it 

argosy-allstory weekly
sir philip chuckled  my man makes
away with my cigars at a shockin rate but
i never can catch him at it the cheeky
beggar i say no ones disturbed our
board have they
   indeed no orbit replied  i gave
strict orders and we can finish to-night sir
philip held the amateur chess champion-
ship for great britain for five years
  he added this to mccarty and then
turned as ching lee appeared again and
spoke to him once more in his native tongue
the butler advanced and placed in mc-
cartys hands the bottle he had seen in
orbits room two nights before
   has it been uncorked do you know
since twas found beside you mccarty
regarded the contents critically removed
the cork himself for a cautious whiff hur-
riedly replacing it he handed the bottle
back to ching lee and rose
   i dont think so orbit whipped out
his handkerchief and pressed it to his nose
 i am susceptible to that odor at any
rate since wednesday night sorry not to
be of any greater help to you i shall de-
pend on you and the inspector to keep me
informed of any developments that may
arise
  seeing him get up from his chair ching
lee had waited to show him out as mc-
carty trudged toward the east gate through
the driving rain once more he shook his
head come night it would be a week
since hughes had been done to death and
the end was not yet clear
  he made his way to the lunchroom on
third avenue which he and dennis had
previously visited and in deference to the
day ordered fried oysters they were long
in coming and he rested his elbows wearily
on the table was he getting too old for
the game after all in days gone by when
he was in harness hed have got to the
truth long since and though it had been a
dogs life in more ways than one he re-
gretted more than ever to have left it and
grown rusty
  all at once he straightened in his chair
and sat staring at the cynical warning to
 watch your hat and coat  on the wall
before him as if the legend was wholly un-
familiar to him the belated appearance
of the waitress with the oysters roused him
from his stupor and he rose hurriedly
   dont want em he muttered thickly
 gimme the check i got to beat it
  spilling a dime onto the table he took
the slip of pasteboard paid for his un-
touched food mechanically at the cashiers
desk and went out as one in a dream once
having turned the corner he seemed gal-
vanized into life and set off briskly enough
for the subway
  twenty minutes later he presented him-
self at headquarters after being closeted
with the chief of the detective bureau for
some little time he departed armed with
certain credentials for the main office of
the telephone company
  there he spent a long and seemingly un-
productive hour going over the calls from
the gotham exchange which included the
new queens mall for the previous tues-
day
  over goddards private wire had gone
numerous messages before the call to blais-
dells studio by trafford in the late after-
noon when horaces continued absence had
caused alarm there were fully a score of
numbers registered before goddard himself
bad summoned mccarty
  orbits telephone too had been busy
with the caterer decorator florist and a
musical agency in connection with the func-
tion of the afternoon and three messages to
the coal dealer innumerable others fol-
lowed presumably sent by guests until the
evening was far advanced
  only four calls had been sent from the
bellamy house and they appeared to have
been made by the lady herself for they
were to modiste hairdresser perfumer and
a prominent department store
  parsonss number besides local trades-
men had been connected with a foreign
consulate several charitable societies and
a banking house while the sloane household
had communicated with dr allonby a drug
store an agency for male nurses the office
number of a noted financier and several
residence numbers of well-known social
lights
  mccarty copied one or two from each
list and sallied forth to verify them but
although the afternoon was long twilight
annihilation

had not yet come when he returned to his
rooms and entered cautiously
  they had not been intruded upon on this
occasion however but he remained only
long enough to secure the page torn from
the encyclopedia then he slopped out
again through the teeming street to the fire
house which domiciled engine company
no 
  dennis was matching nickels with mike
in the dormitory and reaping a rich har-
vest he hastily promised the loser his re-
venge later and slid down the pole to join
mccarty
   ive looked for you all afternoon he
declared reproachfully adding  youve
news i can see it in the eye of you and
i might have known something would start
whilst i was out of it
   theres nothing new mccarty re-
sponded quietly  ive a queer notion in
my head but its too sickening to spring
even after all we know has happened till
i get hold of something to back it up
parsons phoned for me this morning-the
old gentleman himself-and told me the
truth about what was missing since wednes-
day night which was no news he said it
was clever the way youd disconnected the
inside alarm arrangement-
  me denniss leathery countenance
blanched  tis what i get for letting you
lead me into breaking the law now ill
get thrown out of the department and
pinched and molly will change the babys
name
   oh parsons did not know twas you
denny he just said it had been cleverly
done mccarty hastened to explain  i
sprung it on him about porter and radley
and asked him what would he do if a fellow
escaped that he thought was innocent and
came to him he spoke up quick that hed
turn him over to the authorities anyway
twould be his higher duty to our social
fabric whatever that is
   it would would it dennis ejacu-
lated in fine scorn  the social fabric
could go to blazes for all of me but id
stick to a pa innocent or no howsom-
ever ive not the grand cold blooded prin-
ciples of him you know the poor devils
been caught crazier than a loon
  mccarty nodded
   porter knows it too hes beaten it
for fear hell be sent up for hiding him
he finished his account of the mornings in-
terview and then drew the torn page from
his pocket  theres more to this thing
about the calabar bean that i didnt read
you denny so i brought it around and
maybe twill give us an idea listen
 calabar bean ordeal nut the seed of
physostigma ven-en-osum a twining half
shrubby plant native of africa- 
   what of it dennis was frankly
bored  how is that going to help
   wait a bit  the kernel is hard and
white and yields its virtue to alcohol and
less perfectly to water 
   ill bet it does or theyd never have
got it down hughes if what weve heard
of his habits is straight interrupted den-
nis his interest once more aroused
 there youve got it mac find the
last one he took a drink with and youll
have the guy that croaked him
   thats not all mccarty began again
  the beans are reddish gray or -um-
 kidney shaped and about the size -
never mind that  care should be taken to
avoid spontaneous- 
   did you trail around here in all the
rain to give me a botany lesson dennis
demanded indignantly  tis not from any
book youll be learning the truth i was
that upset last night what with the re-
volver shot and all that i never thought
to ask you but what did the old guy you
know uptown say about that busted blue
balloon could he make out from the way
it was rotting before our eyes the kind of
gas there was in it
  mccarty hesitated and then said slowly
 denny youll mind the other night after
we had examined it i put it in a cracker
box while we went for a bite to eat and
when we came home you saw me hunting
around for something
   you were trying to whistle too den-
nis nodded  that always means you
think youre putting something over what
was it
   i was hunting for that cracker box
i knew the minute we came back into the
room somebodyd been there for there

argosy-allstory weekly
was the stale smell of a heavy cigar on
the air not as if hed been smoking right
then but the scent of it was strong on
him as he passed through the place when
i found the missing box i knew what hed
come for
   think of that now do you know
what it means mac the murderer knows
you and not the medical examiners assist-
ant had taken it from the conservatory i
wonder if he followed us from then on
the sight of us parading through the streets
with all them balloons would have told him
we were on if he wasnt blind dennis
grinned  leave the medical examiner find
out what kind of gas was it we know how
twas give to her though not what busted
the balloon right in her face nor how the
gas got in it the notion come to me that
twas not meant to kill lucette anyway
not kill her exclaimed mccarty
 the first whiff of it must have knocked
her cold
   but what if it was intended for the
baby and not for her dennis lowered
his voice  what if the murderer has a
craze for killing children ive heard tell
of such things and so have you suppose
hughes was poisoned by mistake in the
first place for ching lee so that little fu
moy wouldnt be protected then horace
was taken away and maybe killed and the
bellamy baby was next on the list-
   denny youre running wild mccarty
interrupted in his turn  the murderers
brain has got a twist to it but hes not
as crazy as all that baby killers are just
stupid low brutes without the shrewdness
or knowledge to plan such crimes as were
up against now were fighting a mind not
a fist with a knife or a club in it
  so youve been saying dennis re-
torted disgustedly  that comes of those
books youve been reading whilst youve
been figuring out his ancestors and the
blood thats in him to decide is he in the
 born  or  habit  class like that diagnostic
book of yours has it hes been having an
old home week in the mall kidnaping and
killing right and left twill be a week
to-night-
  mccarty beat a hasty retreat and took
his solitary way to the restaurant where
he ate a hearty dinner to make up for the
deferred lunch then he returned to the
mall to prowl about like an unquiet if
somewhat too material ghost the rain had
stopped at last and although the sky was
still partially overcast the glimmer of a
few stars gave promise of a clear dawn
lights were brilliant in the sloane parsons
and orbit residences but low in goddards
and mrs bellamys where the lady had
been in a hysterical state since the murder
of her babys nurse
  yost had been relieved from his post at
the mortuary to take the place of the night
watchman and mccarty walked up and
down with him for more than an hour
discussing the strange chain of tragedies
all at once as they passed the court next
to the goddard house he heard a low coax-
ing masculine voice investigating they
came upon trafford bending over something
which lay in the shadows
  come on old fellow the tutor was
saying  come along in the house like a
good boy horace isnt here max-its
no good waiting-
   tis a strange acting dog and no mis-
take trafford mccarty remarked
  the tutor looked up
   hes grieving himself to death he
said  he hasnt touched a morsel of food
since tuesday though weve tempted him
with everything and he is so weak he
can scarcely stand he waits about out
here all the time for horace to come home
ive got to get him in now if i have to carry
him
  at this juncture however max rose lan-
guidly to his feet and began sniffing at mc-
cartys boots whining softly
  tis like he was trying to talk the
latter exclaimed
   i wish he could if he knows anything
trafford replied sadly  if horacesist
found soon his mother will lose her mind
mccarty cant you people do any thing
even to know the-the worst would be
better than this horrible uncertainty and
suspense
   the lads disappearance is not the half
of what were up against trafford mc-
carty reminded him  were doing every-
thing mortal to find him and soon maybe
annihilation

to-morrow were going to take a big
chance
  he watched while the tutor led the dog
into the house then shaking his head
he proceeded to orbits and rang the bell
it was little fu moy resplendent in his em-
broidered serving jacket who opened the
door and without announcing him beck-
oned and preceded him to the library where
the last interview had taken place
  the room was in deep shadow save for
the glow from the hearth and a single
broad beam from a bridge lamp which
played down upon a chessboard laid out on
a small table at opposite sides of it two
silent intent figures sat as immovably as
graven images if they were aware of mc-
cartys appearance they made no sign
  were they hypnotized or something
the two of them couldnt be asleep sitting
bolt upright like that mccarty waited a
good five minutes and then advanced slow-
ly into the room but still they appeared
oblivious
  orbit was sitting forward his eyes glued
on the board his hands clasped and elbows
resting on the arms of the chair but the
florid faced englishman appeared to be
gazing off into space with the intent yet
absent look of one absorbed in profound
concentration
  then slowly orbits right had disengaged
itself from the other and he moved a piece
upon the board his hand almost mechani-
cally seeking its former position
  a little smile twitched at the corners of
sir philips mouth and with a swift in-
take of his breath he moved sweeping from
the board the figure of shining white with
which orbit had just played the latter
instantly lifted his head and raised his eyes
to the high beamed ceiling and with the
slight gesture the first sound broke the still-
ness as a muffled barely audible exclama-
tion came from sir philips throat
  orbit made one more move and then
glanced in amused commiseration at his
friend
   checkmate sir philip i shall give you
your revenge in london next season
    say old son that was damned clever
led me right into ambush what i wish
some of the masters could have seen it
oh there you are mccarty are you a
chess player by any chance
   no sir mccarty advanced a step
farther  mr orbit fu moy showed me
straight in and i waited so as not to disturb
you
   thats all right orbit nodded pleas-
antly  our game is over you have news
for me
   of a sort ltou recall saying on
wednesday that you thanked heaven the
bellamy baby was old enough to talk
yes orbit responded eagerly i
have tried several times to see mrs bel-
lamy and little maude the mother is
still almost overcome by the narrow escape
of her child from the same terrible death
the poor nurse suffered and will not permit
it out of her sight for a moment while she
herself is too prostrated to see any one
   the little one talked to me the other
day mccarty vouchsafed
   she did why didnt you tell me
orbit pushed back his chair and rose  did
she see any one hear anything tell me
for gods sake this may be most im-
portant
  his fine eyes had lighted and the latent
excitement seemed to have communicated
itself to his guest for sir philip also rose
   no sir she knew no more than you
or i but she kept asking for her balloon
it seems lucette had bought it for her off
a wop by the gate just before you invited
them in twas a blue one the baby said
and she was persistent about it but i recall
seeing no toy balloon in that conservatory
did you
   no orbit shook his head  i really
dont know though i didnt notice partic-
ularly surely it couldnt have had any-
thing to do with the case though what is
it fu moy
  the little coffevboy spoke rapidly in
chinese and after a moment orbit turned
with a gesture which took in both sir philip
and mccarty
   i am wanted on the telephone will
you excuse me
  when he had left the room the english-
man glanced again at the chessboard with
the self-centered absorption of the enthu-
siast

argosy-allstory weekly
   too bad you didnt understand that
play dash it all very clever on the
twenty-first move his knight captured my
pawn check i moved the king to the
queens square by jove he moved the
queen to the bishops sixth check ah
i captured his queen with my knight and
then the bally orbit moved his bishop to
kings seventh checkmate devilish trick
i should say really mccarty he had
served me with what is known in chess par-
lance as  the immortal partie 
   checkmate repeated mccarty slow-
ly  that means calling the turn then
blocking every play and the secret of it is
-looking ahead

dleak the autumn night without
cold the hearth within
     loud the gale with roar and rout

melting merging still they fly

     though the tempests towering arm
     rock the flaming skies
there be places hidden calm

     on this hallowed shore

harold white
by winona godfrey
for the first time since that niftiest
custom-built sport mode car had hit
him amidships -mr nevin jenkins
lashbroofce did not have a distinct pain
nevertheless his young brow remained dis-
tinctly clouded kis mother always called
him  nevin dear and he had carefully
fostered his schooldays nickname  jenks
which made mother shudder iioth names
fit pretty well manlike he preferred the
world to think him all  jc-nks although he
knew well enough that ihere was a hideous-
ly large strain of nevin in his secret soul
  he lay on a couch in his room at mrs
macallisters a large shabby sunny room
in the back of the house whose windows
overlooked mrs macs hilarious tangle of
garden with the fig tree that was her special
pride in the middle of it his scowl deep-
ened as he heard his best friend tim
atkins saying on the stairs  no dont
bother ill go right up
  darn tim and his facetiousness
  tim in his own patter  blew in
   hello old kid how goes it right as
rain i hear met the eminent dr green-
ways just outside-said you all but threw
him out ancl he fully expected you to be
as good as new in another few days feel-
ing all right
   oh sure growled nevin
  mr atkins dropped into a chair and
lighted a cigarette then he leaned forward
and inquired in a mock-thrilled whisper
 any callers to-day
  nevin glared at him how in thunder
he had stayed on good terms all these years
with this insufferable ass
  tim grinned back  whats a broken
collar-bone when served with all the ingredi-
ents of romance just nothing a-tall of
all the luck now if it had been me some
farmer in a ford would have broken a leg
for me and sued me for damages but you
-ah you and them beaux yeux and miss
beresford lane you were hit by a ford
beres-ford never thought of that before
thats good hit in the collar-bone by a
couple of millions and every day theyve
come over and held your hand
  silence from the invalid about every
day tim had played this humorous theme

argosy-allstory weekly
with variations he inspected nevin now
with a little surprise not understanding why
he was not being more cheered-up by this
kidding must not be feeling so good after
all tims loud cheerful tones lowered
   say it was tough luck just when you
were on your way to collect the reward of
virtue she ought to be in jail-tearing
along at that rate you know i was think-
ing about her this morning when i stopped
at jims to have the battery tested over-
charged thats what she is nothing to
do but play nothing to think of but dress
and dance and flirt and how to spend mon-
ey not a responsibility or a need and
the very devil of a dynamo piling up en-
ergy all the time and urging her into seven
kinds of mischief yep overcharged thats
what she is tim paused much pleased
with his analogy and to find lashbrooke
interested
    i expect thats so the latter thought-
fully agreed
   come to think of it tim pursued
 didnt the papers say that grace wray-
burn was a pal of this lane girl you
know old wrayburns daughter that got in-
to that mess with a riding-master it was
one of those things i forget just what
 oh i never read that rot said nevin
irritably
   well theyre an overcharged bunch
tim repeated the adjective with relish
 the little wraybum was just playing
around but there was an awful explosion
he looked at his watch and rose  must
be getting back only had a few minutes
 ill be down monday said nevin with-
out enthusiasm
   all right fine ill tell the old man
and say june was asking after you again
he shook nevins hand  now shout if
i can do anything for you
  the convalescent seemed relieved by
tims exit if hed just get away before-
but no young mr atkinss most amiable
tones once more rose from below  oh
good-morning miss lane how are you
this morning fine-coming along in
great style-
   oh damn commented mr nevin
lashbrooke
  then a murmur of feminine voices mrs
macs robust soprano and that other so
cool so clear so assured so individual that
it could not possibly belong to anybody in
the world but to miss beresford lane in
another moment she had entered to him
  having two-or ten-million dollars in
her own right it goes without saying that
beresford was a beauty as a hundred-a-
month stenographer the designation would
probably have been just  some girl she
did not have the chiseled bisque-doll fea-
tures of a film queen but nevin was about
the only man shed ever met who did not
consciously or unconsciously try to hold
her hand just a teeny second longer no
figurine from tanagra could show a more
exquisite body-nor much more frankly in
bathing suit and evening gown-than this
daughter of today but in street-dress as
now slim boyish straightness matchless
ankles
  after a greeting as comradely as tims
she sat there cross-legged in his one rocking-
chair saying she bet he was glad he
wouldnt have to lie around much longer
and  i expect youd like to give me a
black eye just for good measure now
wouldnt you
  he laughed with her not very whole-
heartedly and she looked a little as if she
didnt quite make him out and was puz-
zled by such an unheard-of impasse did
he really value his collar-bone more than
an introduction to berry lane astonish-
ing at least not to say it was worth it
  springing to repair something he hardly
knew what after all his carefulness he
blundered horribly  it was my own fault
-not looking where i was going you see
the firm was sending me on rather an im-
portant trip to buenos aires and i was
rushing around and- idiot what was
he blabbing that for	
  she leaned forward  you were no-
body told me that he had promised to
kill tim if he hinted it to her  and youve
been delayed all this time oh im awfully
sorry mr lashbrooke are you going
then as soon as youre able
   well-ah-no oh he should certain-
ly kick himself for that slip  you see
somebody had to go right away so they-
of course they had to send another man
overcharged

his only hope now was to make her think
it didnt matter  there was no difficulty
about that he assured her lightly
  she was regarding him so thoughtfully
that he squirmed  i suppose not she
said  but you-i can see you wanted to
go
   why i was glad to get out of it he
lied wildly it was no use he knew that
with her infernal intuition she knew just as
well as if he had told her that it was his
big chance a chance that might have led to
wonderful things he had worked hard
and he was twenty-eight it was oppor-
tunity at last giving him a hope of getting
his nose off the grindstone nobody had
ever handed him anything on a silver platter
and just as he had pulled himself up to
take something well-earned this girl whod
had everything handed to her brushed by
and knocked the whole thing out of his
hand and now to his misery he perceived
that she guessed it
  he had kept the bitterness of his disap-
pointment even from tim and he had not
even to himself coupled it with any other
emotion now of a sudden he hated with
fury this lying here weakly he wanted
not in envy or revenge but oh he wanted
fiercely their positions to be reversed-he
saw himself magnificent in his young
strength striding from some wreck or other
her linp figure in his arms-
  with one of those quick characteristic
movements she was at his side  it was
bad enough to hurt you without doing you
a lot of other damage too isnt there
something i can do to fix it oh please
dont hesitate if there is she looked
down at him half-expectantly and he
actually felt rising to his ridiculous tongue
a hoarse imperious whisper- only kiss
me he bit it off to substitute  oh
come youre making a mountain out of
nothing please dont bother about it a bit
more its all over and no eternal damage
done
  it was as if he had pushed her away but
 im glad to hear that she returned in
the old cool assuredness  we can shake
hands then and part friends oh dont
get up
  he got to his slippered feet though
 youve been more than kind he told
her  please dont think me unapprecia-
tive he was so formal so very final
about it he took her hand immediately-
released it
   good-by she said  will you come
to see me some time and let me know youve
quite recovered
   thank you ill be delighted to come
  she smiled back from the door looking
directly into his eyes
  there was laughter in hers whimsical
challenge-and something else  good-by
ii
  on an evening three weeks or so later
he parked the little roadster he and tim
owned together in the lane driveway and
walked up to the elegant entrance it was
his first call and he had promised himself
all the way out that it would be his last
he had not meant to see her again but a
few days before she had driven up along-
side as he was walking home
   quite recovered i see she called
gayly
   quite thank you some common-
places and then  arent you coming to
see me at all
  so-here he was
  the lane house stood on a hill-top and
nevin looked out as over a tremendous
diamond stomacher of glittering city twink-
ling off into dark-blue distances the great
house towered over him the wide gardens
spread sweet and dim around it and it all
belonged to one girl-no old woman lives
in this shoe-she has so much money she
dont know what to do- a butler had
opened the door 
  nevin was not stfewn into the drawing
room but into a smaller living-room very
tasteful very comfortable very charming
he was annoyed to have it occur to him that
his yearly income would not pay for this
one rooms furnishings
  she came down at once and after all she
was beautiful wasnt she no chaperon
spoiled their tete-a-tete some old cousins
of her mothers lived with her he under-
stood but they did not presume to appear-
  enchanted night and what were the

argosy-allstory weekly
mad antics the intoxications the varied
delights of this enchantment oh they
just talked what about that was so en-
grossing oh-well-nothing special and
she sang a couple of songs from a new
musical comedy she had seen in new york
and read him some verses of edna millays
that she found delicious that was all
  he would leave early of course so he
looked at his watch after about three-
quarters of an hour and it was two minutes
to twelve
  she came out on the veranda with him
and stood there so slim and sweet in the
spangled midnight and it was so still and
cool and there was no world about them
really no work nor money nor anxiety nor
pride there was only berry lane with bare
arms on a hill-top he must take her hand
for good night he must look into her moon-
pale face he must see her fresh lips part-
must feel his own against them-
iii
  queerest thing how you can just shoot
through space-and queerer even how you
got through it without hitting any solid
objects until the squeal of brakes brought
you plump against mrs macs garage
nevin trod air around to the front door
and was floating on upstairs when on the
little stand in the hall he saw a letter ad-
dressed to him it had been there doubtless
when he came home to dress for his call but
his mail usually came to the office and he
expected none here mrs mac had propped
it up against a book so as to attract his
attention
  it was from his mother he had not told
her of his accident until he was well had
then passed over it as of no consequence
this was her answer
  mother and son usually kept house to-
gether this winter however mrs lash-
brooke called by the illness of her only
sister had gone to her in the little mid-
western city where nevin was born giving
up their little flat for economys sake
nevin had taken this room at mr mac-
allisters and it would not be true to say
that he had not enjoyed his freedom
in his room he glanced through the letter
knowing just what she would say-suddenly
he registered attention surprise
    nevin how wonderful for you to have met
  miss lane and in this way that must surely
  interest her in you i know she has never
  met a brighter handsomer boy than mine i
  have heard she has two millions in her own
  right or is it ten
 there was more of the same nevins
eyes cooled his mouth set in her excite-
ment mother had said not more than she
meant but more than she would have dis-
creetly admitted that she meant had she
been talking to him if it had been any
other girl he would have laughed at dear
silly mother wanting him to ensnare an
heiress this was different and sillier
  for the next week his assiduous attention
to his duties was almost painful his en-
tire business life had been spent in the em-
ploy of the presswell electric appliance
company he had entered it as the merest
lad given it his best after the war he
had marveled at his luck in getting the dear
old job back if since he was not advanc-
ing as rapidly as he wished he consoled
himself with the idea that it was a good
place to hang on to anyway aside from the
fact that on account of mother he could
afford to take no gambling chances old
mr presswell must retire before so very
long that meant reorganization and with
newer methods a general speeding-up the
old firm should become a power in its line
should carry up with it all the faithful
ones
  this morning coming in from lunch he
ran into june barker old mr presswell s
stenographer
  whats the matter trying to work
yourself to death her friendly eyes
scrutinized him while she removed her hat
and touched her hair here and there with
nicely manicured fingers she was a neat
fresh-looking girl not exactly pretty per-
haps a wholesome efficient sort of person
   well i have been busy he said and
suddenly realized how completely he had
forgotten june of late he had been in the
habit of seeing her quite frequently of
spending an occasional evening at her house
taking her to the movies or perhaps to call
upon young friends maybe for a ride cut to
overcharged

the beach on his nights to have the little
car
   feeling all right again
   oh yes surely they had had good
times together it was a shame to neglect
her as he had been doing  we havent
been to a movie for a coons age have we
want to go some night
  a faint flush warmed her face  of
course i do most any night
   to-night
  she nodded yes smilingly
   all right fine well have a little
dinner at maries shall we she was ob-
viously delighted
  he felt cheered up a bit come to think
of it he had felt pretty dumpy lately he
had been more dashed about that buenos
aires business than he cared to admit
  they made very merry at dinner june
was unusually animated most appreciative
of any little joke only once did she be-
come the business woman for a moment
 did you feel awfully bad about losing
out on that buenos aires trip she asked
   oh-not so bad he fenced  it was
a good chance but well it couldnt be
helped
   maybe i shouldnt mention this
nevin she looked at him gravely  you
know weve expected old mr presswell to
retire before another hundred years well
quite a few things have happened lately
that make me think its going to happen
sooner
  he was interested  is that so
   yes now of course i dont mean
anything definite but things have been said
that gave me a hunch you know i believe
if they found a buyer the presswells would
sell out
  he stared at her earnest little face that
the old firm would really change hands had
never been thought of that would make
a tremendous difference to everybody no
guessing all it might mean
   nothing to worry about anyway said
june  it might mean bigger things i
just thought id tell you nevin
   thanks he said slowly years of
service might mean nothing to new people-
oh well sure enough no use worrying
about something that hadnt happened yet
  they came out of the restaurant into
such a delicious twilight that june pro-
tested against going into the theater at
once  lets ride out a way and then
maybe well run across some neighborhood
bill that wed like to see
  he agreed and presently headed the
little car toward the sea but at western
and wilshire there was a bad traffic jam
somebody had rammed a bumper under
somebodys fender and the halted motors
according to their short-sighted custom
nosed into every space and so stopped all
progress nevins little car drew in along-
side a limousine whose uniformed chauffeur
eyed him with hauteur
  oh look june whispered isnt
that berry lane
  he had already seen her yes wrapped
in an elaborate evening-coat that opened
a little at the throat revealing a hint of
decollete sitting beside a young man in a
dinner-jacket whose head was turned in-
terestedly toward her-miss beresford
lane
  yes he had already seen her and she
had seen him and just as he saw without
looking at them the big car and the smart
young man and the pearls around her neck
she saw the little car and the nice girl and
the content of her face
  their eyes met she bowed and smiled
he bowed and smiled the big car darted
easily forward and left the little one behind
  nevin became very intent on his driving
and they had gone several blocks before
june spoke either  i know that chap too
its billy deming his fathers president
of the security trust where i used to work
 yes said nevin
   hes quite a nice fellow she went on
casually  i mean likable but a good deal
of a cake-eater i guess maybe hell marry
miss lane though and wont ever have to
work
   probably
   ive wondered about those marriages
its considered so romantic for a poor girl
to marry a rich man i dont know why it
seems some way sordid for a poor man to
marry a rich girl if its all right for a rich
man to buy the girl he wants it ought to
be all right for a rich girl to buy the man

argosy-allstory weekly
she wants thats equality isnt it she
laughed she was making conversation
not knowing exactly why it needed making
 ought to work both ways said nevin
 somebody ought to make a comedy
about it like these about the millionaire
that marries the shopgirl and his set snubs
her that ones been done to death
   ought to make a good comc-dy judged
nevin
  june for no reason sighed  well i
suppose a girl like berry lane can have
any man she wants rich or poor seems
to me though if i had everything and had
been everywhere and seen oodles of men
i wouldnt want billy deming
   think not said nevin then they
changed the subject but he had wanted to
ask why june thought berry lane could
have any man she wanted
  on the second morning he received this
note
  dear mr lashbrooke
    im having some friends in friday evening
  and id like to have you irop in if youve
  nothing better to do not a party do
  please come
                         sincerely
                        beresford lane
  why in thunder should he want to waste
a good evening with a lot cf dolls and wiliy-
boys he certainly did not want to hed
send his regrets spent all wednesday
evening composing and revising same
spent his spare time thursday and friday
buying a new dinner-jacket and new shirts
and collars decided friday night as he
was shaving that he would phone unex-
pected business-sorry hed lie unable to
make it at eight thirty sharp he drove
up the lane driveway in a taxi it being
tims night to use the  boat
  jui would have called it a party there
were six couples besides nevin and berry
not that there was any reason for such
arbitrary pairing since it seemed that two
or three of the girls had come together
they sang and danced and ate and flirted
one of the girls a miss wellworth called
for some inexplicable reason  bumps
made eyes at nevin they all seemed to
know that nevin was the smashee of
berrys  smash and there were a good
many jokes about it  why im having
a good time he was surprised to discover
  he danced with berry he did not have
much to say to her and she did not chatter
through the dance like the other girls for
one thing he just danced with these other
girls-and he was conscious of having berry
lane in his arms
  once she said mischievously  june is
a sweet girl isnt she
   what do you know about june
  his surprise seemed to amuse her  oh
billy told me the other night i think he
is a little sweet on her himself
  nevin made ready to go when the others
did remarking billy deming lingering in
the background  ive had an awfully
good time he said to berry
   im glad but i suppose youll never
call me up or come again unless youre
dragged she smiled maybe she did not
know that he was thinking of the last time
he was here certainly she gave no sign
that she remembered it miss wellworth
put a hand on his arm and began to chatter
about a party she was going to have
  in the confusion no one noticed that he
had no car and he had not called a taxi
so presently he was walking down sedately
to the nearest car line not floating as on
that former occasion no to-night his feet
were on the ground
   im falling in love with her he ad-
mitted now honestly  and ive got to
stop it before im hurt like the devil
theres nothing in playing with this set for
a fellow like me i havent time and i
havent the money its simply bad business
how could i marry a girl like that and
she would never think of marrying me any-
way its all play with her im new and
those were cozy little talks we had when i
was laid up there and she has nothing else
to do its just play for her but it will be
hell for me if i dont pull up
  he had not noticed the car line when he
came to it just kept on walking it was
three oclock when he stole upstairs at
mrs macs but that good lady cocked
an ear in spite of his caution  my land
this is the first time that boy hasnt been
in by twelve i hope he aint gettin into
mischief now his mas away
overcharged

  he could have told her he was doing his
best and he was pretty full of the struggle
next day when as he was leaving after a
little conference with mr presswell the
latter stopped him
   by the way lashbrooke i know you
were disappointed about the south american
trip youve been pretty loyal to us and
id like to see you get on now this is
strictly between ourselves this business
may i say may pass into other hands
   oh- nevins eyes widened
   in such an event continued the old
gentleman   want to say that you among
others will be recommended highly to the
new owners
   thank you very much said nevin
but his heart sank the presswells were
simply going to  pass the buck any
new owner would as likely as not consider
the old presswell men dead wood after
all what did it matter what did anything
matter
  as she had predicted he did not com-
municate with berry lane but he took
june to the theater picking the first west-
ern performance of a popular eastern play
everybody would be there they were
she sat two rows in front and to nevins
left and between acts she saw him and
spoke sweetly
   were always running into her arent
we june giggled  got another cavalier
to-night i see goodness the money those
girls spend on clothes she went on in
her chatty way  just look at her wrap-
five thousand dollars if it cost a cent and
just think of the families that havent got
that a year why i dont know a young
married couple that have more than twenty-
five hundred and most of them have
babies too
  nevin had three thousand he mumbled
something and moved uneasily all of a
sudden he was struck by junes look of
satisfaction he had not been really think-
ing of her at all but this attention had
pleased her she had said how extravagant
he was to buy these seats-she liked the
balcony perfectly well nevertheless she
regarded that extravagance as a subtle com-
pliment
  what was he doing he liked june
she was nice jolly little pal a girl like
june would marry a man and keep house
gayly and efficiently on whatever he had
thats what hed do if he had any sense-
marry some girl like june it would be so
suitable
  the house darkened and he watched to
see if the footlights might not cast a golden
reflection on the face of berry lane june
relaxed contentedly beside him
iv
  tiie deal had gone through the hold-
ings of the presswell company had passed
completely into the hands of the great
western electric company the excite-
ment the ill-concealed anxiety of the press-
well employees was heightened by the mys-
tery surrounding the whole transaction no-
body had ever heard of the great western
it was a brand new concern wild rumors
about it came from every direction it
was pretty generally conceded that the
great western had walked in at the last
moment and by an enormous cash payment
taken the thing right away from the origi-
nal negotiators
  nevin did not understand his own in-
difference in what was surely a crisis in his
life if the great western did not want
him he guessed he could get a job some-
where about the only feeling he had about
it was that of relief that his mother wasnt
there to worry
  then an amazing letter from which this
paragraph stood out as if written in red
    in connection with ihc taking over by the
  great western electric company of the press-
  well works the undersigned desire to consult
  with you upon a matter of groat importance
  to yourself
  and there was the signature of blessing-
ton  burbage the biggest lawyers in town
through whom the preswell transaction had
been handled nevin could hardly believe
his eyes why this is wild blessington
 burbage consulting with an insignifi-
cant underling like himself it must be a
mistake it must be
  mention of blessington  burbage ob-
tained instant permission to answer their
call

argosy-allstory weekly
  mr burbage received him cordially
some preliminary generalities about high
recommendations from the retiring com-
pany he would understand that mr bur-
bage was merely acting as agent for the
great western which was prepared to in-
stall mr lashbrooke as general manager oj
the new company
  this was one of those fantastic ones
nevin couldnt remember having eaten any-
thing special-funny what made you dream
these absurd situations this one was on
a par with riding around on a whale picking
daisies he smiled and waited to wake
up
  mr burbage smiled back  youre
pretty young of course he said  but i
understand youve practically grown up
with-thg presswells and know the business
from the ground up it should be a wonder-
ful opportunity to show what young blood
and ideas can do
  nevins eyes kindled his jaw set  oh
i can do it but-but- he fell back
into bewilderment rubbed his forehead
would have pinched himself but for mr
burbages steady gaze  but i dont un-
derstand mr burbage theres no sense
to it why should the great western-
why they dont know me i havent the
slightest notion as to a single person con-
nected with the great western i cant
imagine business-big business men-elect-
ing a young fellow like me in this offhand
way i dont say im not competent i
can swing it all right i know i can do
that but how do they know it-the men
who have put their good money into this
deal
  mr burbage smiled again and it seemed
to nevin that his smile had grown a bit
knowing  your curiosity is pardonable
mr lashbrooke said he  and entirely
understandable in a young man of your
evident good sense i can only say this
that the great western is owned by one
person that final decision lies with that one
person and that one person has elected to
name you manager of the business formerly
know as the presswell company
  nevin stared at him  and this person
is-
  mr burbage made a little gesture  un-
known i am not supposed to impart to
you even the small information i have
 it seems a very unnecessary mystery
nevin protested  i dont see any use in
it and frankly i dont like it if this
person can trust me with the management
of a big investment like this it seems to
me i could be trusted with his name to
whom am i responsible who is going to
keep tab on my management
   mr lashbrooke arent you subjecting
the goose who laid the golden egg to an
ungrateful scrutiny burbages small eyes
twinkled  reports will be made to us
acting as business agents for our client
nevin found it necessary to apply his
handkerchief to his forehead
   it did seem to me continued mr
burbage and there appeared to be no ob-
vious reason vhy he should enjoy it so
much  that this was a terrible tax on any
young mans curiosity however theres
no law against putting two and two to-
gether and- the telephone rang and
mr burbage replied  oh yes to some
inquiry  i have it here he opened a
drawer and took out a paper evidently
notes from which he read some items
    he acts as if he thought i did know
and was only pretending ignorance nevin
puzzled  he acts as if i were just keep-
ing up some sort of game looks as if he
might wink at me any minute  his glance
fell wholly by chance upon that open drawer
and upon a document that lay uppermost
among its contents there was a black
signature scrawled across it and there was
something familiar about that black signa-
ture then it fairly leaped at him-
beresfokd lane
  mr burbage hung up the receiver closed
the drawer and as he swung around again
in his chair the slightly knowing smile was
returning to his lips nevin with a face
like chalk was already upon his feet
    please inform your client mr bur-
bage that i am resigning to-day from the
presswell company and that i am not open
to any offer whatever from the great
western thank you
 but my dear boy gasped burbage
   good morning said lashbrooke
overcharged

  of course the fact that blessington and
burbage might be beresford lanes lawyers
meant nothing there was not the slightest
reason in the world to think that she-
but he knew it just as well as he knew
anything he knew that beresford lane had
done this
  even so what was he so furious about
in all the cinderella stories didnt the
prince tactfully see that cinderella had all
the accessories the proper gowns and hats
and jewels before he presented her in his
marble halls and wasnt she properly
grateful and think it was just sweet of
him then if situations being reversed
the princess tactfully bought a little two or
three million dollar business for her cinders
so that he would be suitably equipped for
her circles why should cinders be in such
a towering rage
  she just wanted him for a plaything -
god knows why-and to gratify any little
whim like that she was willing to spend a
million or so oh he saw clearly enough
that the only reason she did this was be-
cause he had piqued her vanity by not fol-
lowing up the opportunity for a flirtation
and if he had weakly told her what she
had aroused in him she would have laughed
and gone off to paris or china or- oh he
knew the breed overcharged she
wanted him to know her power
  what a fool he had made of himself
he should have accepted blandly and gone
out and married june if she would have
him he knew now why men got drunk
in the days when it was handy he tried
to pull himself together he knew he
wasnt thinking straight couldnt think
straight just yet what a thing to happen
  he had just been rushing on now he
turned and went back to the presswell
office he wasnt so mad now merely
dazed as if he had been hit a tremendous
wallop and hadnt got back much of a sense
of direction he sat down at his desk
fumbled with things pretended to be busy
when his phone rang presently he an-
swered mechanically
   mr lashbrooke it was a low quiet
voice so very low and quiet and charged
with something that suggested nothing less
potent than tnt
   yes he replied as quietly
   this is beresford lane
   yes miss lane
   i have something to say to you some-
thing rather important could you see me
soon im downtown now could you meet
me some place
   i suppose i could if its very impor-
tant his voice was perfectly level
   it is if you will be downstairs in ten
minutes ill drive by and pick you up
 very well thank you
   thank you she hung up
  he took his hat again and went down-
stairs past busy men at desks what was
their business to him at last he was his
own man yes he was out of a job this
business into which he had put brain and
heart and hands-all right this is the end
of that
  he thought he knew what had happened
burbage had immediately notified berry of
nevins action and burbage had been so
sure in his own mind that nevin could not
but know the identity of his client that he
had doubtless told berry that nevin knew
burbage too in looking back for some clew
to nevins emotional exit would surely re-
member the opened drawer and discover
what had been made visible by his own
withdrawal of the upper note-sheet he
would recall his  two and two-
  berry drew into the curb in the same
car with which she had violently made
young mr lashbrookes acquaintance she
was a little pale and she nodded with no
smile to his lifted hat
  he sat beside her stonily while she
threaded traffic finally she slipped into
a quieter street and she began-straight
from the shoulder  why did you refuse
to become manager of the new company
how do you know i refused he in-
quired ironically
  burbage phoned me-fatuous old
blockhead  burbage had undoubtedly re-
ceived his full quota
   it seems strange that mr burbage
should notify you of my refusal nevin
drawled
   lets be frank she urged curtly
   it hasnt seemed your specialty sug-
gested nevin

argosy-allstory weekly
  she bit her lip after a moment went
on  please tell me why you would not
accept such an opportunity
   it was my privilege to refuse it
   but wasnt it a big opportunity for any
young man this more gently
   wonderful of course
   and if it had come from a great west-
ern company-of men she persisted
 you would have been delighted to accept
it
   very likely
   thats why i tried to stay out of sight
she said  it wasnt possible not to
   i dont see what put such an idea in
your head he groaned
   i felt it was my fault that you lost the
south american trip i heard the press-
well company was selling out and i had
burbage investigate i learned that the
purchasing company would not advance
you although it would probably retain the
south american man and make that an
important unit i wanted to make it up
to you
   so you bought the whole works like a
rocking-horse for the baby
  they were getting out of town now the
speedometer whirled up to forty-five under
the urge of her foot dropped back slowly
to a lawful thirty  i dont see why it
should make such a difference to you who
happened to own the old thing her
voice was not so steady as it it had been
 well it does make a difference
   you mean you wouldnt work for me
if it was the last place in the world i sup-
pose she cried angrily
   put it any way you like
   i thought we could be friends
   well we cant he said drearily
oh youre hateful she flung at him
 and ive humbled myself this way
   humbled me you mean
  she turned on him like a little cat all
claws  i could have made you want me
-so much that you couldnt resist but i
wouldnt i wanted- she stopped as
short as she had stopped the car and turned
her face from him
 all right he answered in a low voice
you could you can buy and have every-
thing in the world cant you you always
have and you cant understand anything
else
   im sorry i said that she murmured
   i knew all along it was just that he
went on  you only wanted to put your
mark on me because you were sure it was
your divine prerogative to put it wherever
you fancied i dont see why you should
begrudge me a little self-respect
   oh damn it she groaned out with a
sob
  a terrible sadness ached in his throat be-
yond the red-headed pepper-trees the brown
hills were dressing in green a meadow-lark
called liquidly mocking-birds caroled their
satisfaction with earth
  if only this were all the world and there
was no money and no pride and no bitter-
ness-oh if this were all the world
   and you my sweet penelope out there
somewhere you wait for me  with buds of
roses in your hair and kisses on your
mouth 
  oh to be alone in such a world not with
you penelope but with berry lane our
little lives are almost as short as the butter-
flies what is the good of all the rest if we
let our only love go by
  something took his proud ful arms and
put them around her and turned her face
to his and his lips found hers they pressed
his fiercely and when he looked at her
tears showed on her lashes
  then she sat up  xow that youve
punished me properly i suppose youll go
and marry june-june june that youre
such pals with
  he laughed rapturously  do you think
i will he whispered  it is so sweet to be
silly
   well said beresford lane  ive run
over you and after you and cried over you
and moved heaven and earth to get you
and youre bought and paid for and i dont
think you will
   darling if youre not good when
were married ill remind you of that
   dont you dare and another thing
id like to have settled while were settling
things are you or are you not the manager
of the great western electric company
   yes dear said he with mock meek-
ness  i am

the house of harald
soon after the coming of the dawn
svend the bloody gave the sign for
departure
  out along the forest trail they rode
svend and magnus in the lead and edvard
haakonsson riding but a pace behind them
cheering thralls urged them on their way
tt was a splendid company the pick of
svends warriors with their best armor and
weapons a handful of his most beautiful
shield maidens led by brynhild and thralls
in fresh kirtles-the best and strongest and
most handsome thralls
  those left behind looked upon the de-
parture with varying emotions for all of
them would have gone some of them nota-
bly the men-at-arms expected to go shortly
since there had been whisperings and one
of magnuss most trusted men had been
left behind in command even rolf the
stolid shipmaster gave evidences of excite-
ment and breathed like an old war horse
which was unusual in itself
  the march was taken leisurely and in
comfort through the cool woods and when
the dusk came the company was within a
short distance of haralds house they
camped in the dark forest aisles building
huge fires and roasting meat no tent
was pitched save that of svend for the
others chose to sleep on the ground on
couches of pine needles
  again they were up at dawn svend
sent two men ahead to announce their ap-
proach to harajd and then gave commands
that everything be put in condition for a
proper showing wherefore weapons were

scoured again and secretly sharpened hel-
mets were burnished and armor newly
rubbed
  the bright sun was high in the heavens
when finally they came to the great clearing
before the house of harald the just the
gates and doors stood wide open thralls
in holiday attire ran among the buildings
gay banners had been flung from the walls
	svend the bloody led his gallant com-
pany to within a short distance of the gates
and there he stopped and waited harald
the just came forth to greet him his men
at his back svend dismounted and walked
slowly forward his face inscrutable mag-
nus stalking at his side
  hail svend cried harald the just
raising his hand  hail svend my neigh-
bor
   hail svend replied
   do you come in peace or war
  svend seemed to hesitate a moment at the
question but only for a moment he was
committed to this nefarious enterprise and
he could not retreat now
   we come in peace he said
   then is my house yours svend the
bloody enter and order as you will and
your company with you your maidens
will be greeted by those of my household
your warriors by mine there is food for
your thralls and places of rest this eve-
ning we feast
  now there was a tumult as svends com-
pany dismounted and thralls led the horses
away mcn-at-arms pretended a friendship
that they scarcely felt though their words
were fair when they mingled yet they
watched one another closely for the two
houses had long been enemies and such
things are not forgotten in the passing of a
few days
  edvard haakonsson entered the great
hall with svend and the others and harald
turned for a moment to greet him particu-
larly the ax thrower chaffed because he
was compelled by courtesy to stand there
with the others and exchange meaningless
phrases it was thyra his eyes sought and
none other
  he glanced around the great room at its
giant fireplace its long tables already placed
for the evening feast toward one end
there was a short flight of stone steps that
led up to a landing and a heavy door
edvard haakonsson sensed that this led to
the womens quarters and that thyras
room was there
  yet it was quite some time before he
saw her svend and his men were assigned
to quarters and mingled with haralds men
svend and magnus retired as though to
wash the dust of the journey from their
hands and faces but in reality to whisper
more of the plot
   the men were to have left a short
time behind us jarl and to have passed
the night in the woods magnus said
 they will be at the edge of the forest by
nightfall or a little before
   some straying thrall of haralds may
see them and give the alarm
   any straying thrall who sees them will
see nothing more on this earth magnus
growled  i have given orders covering
everything
   you have planned the signal
   i have jarl when you signal to me
then will i pass the signal on to the others
when we strike here in haralds house the
men in the woods will rush in before harald
and his men-at-arms realize what is hap-
pening
   make certain that you forget nothing
svend directed  and brynhild must be
warned at the proper moment so that the
maidens may rush out of harms way this
is an enterprise in which we must win or
die great thor give us strength 
   brynhild shall be warned
   and-my kinsman-
   i shall attend to the black jarl mag-
nus promised his face growing suddenly
dark  between edvard haakonsson and
myself there is a blood feud
   why svend demanded  for rea-
sons other than mine
  brynhild magnus said
   ha you want the maiden then
you shall have her magnus when this busi-
ness is at an end
  down in the great hall edvard the ax
thrower had been greeting men but mean-
time making his way slowly along the wall
and toward the landing he had seen and
after a time the door at the top of the
the black jarl

flight of steps was opened slowly and
thyra stepped out
  for a moment she stood looking down at
the scene of confusion then she caught sight
of the ax thrower and her face flushed
and her eyes glistened her hands clutched
at her breast which rose and fell with emo-
tion and then she slowly descended to-
ward him and he went forward to greet her
   thyra he breathed
 edvard my as thrower
   all is well with you
   all is well she replied
   have been counting the days
   and i also she whispered  i am
going to feed my hounds you may come
with me
  it was a clever subterfuge to get alone
with him and he realized it across the
great hall they went men bowing before
him and the jarfs daughter out into
the open they walked where thyra beck-
oned some thralls and bade them fetch
meat and so they went to one end of the
great building where a pack of hounds
waited
  she left him for a moment took chunks
of meat from the thralls and walked out
among the hounds they leaped around
her but only in play they sprang back
when she commanded them and waited
until she tossed the meat
  all but one of the thralls retired and
thyra walked back to edvards side
   it seems the lifetime of a man since i
have seen you he said
   it seems long to me too
   is this the time to speak to your
father
   we must wait she said  a little
longer must we keep our love a secret
wait until my father is sure that svend
the bloody means sincere friendship but
do you be with my father as much as it is
possible and teach him to trust you per-
haps before you go away again the word
may be said
  she looked up at him with love shining
in her eyes and he would have kissed her
had he been sure that no one would have
seen for a moment he did hold her hand
  but they were not alone in the world
not that the thrall mattered for he was not
to be taken into consideration but there
was another who watched with eyes flam-
ing in hate
  brynhild had seen edvard haakonsson
greet thyra and had been watching him
before the greeting her womans intuition
told her the truth and when they left the
house she followed at a little distance
though careful not to be seen by them and
she was standing at the corner of the great
house now watching the love light as it
danced in their eyes a moment she
watched then turned swiftly her face black
with rage and reentered the great hall
  magnus came from his visit with svend
and the shield maiden claimed his ear
   the black jarl is in love with haralds
daughter she whispered   have been
watching them he prefers that white face
to me
   they are of a kind-small and soft
magnus replied  as we are of a kind-
big and strong
   that he turns from me to her
   yet is your revenge near magnus
whispered  already i have spoken to
svend and he has promised me your hand
and before the sun rises again i shall have
claimed it
   you mean-
   that edvard haakonsson never will
wed the jarls daughter-or any other wom-
an magnus said  at a later time i shall
tell you more be near me and watch
me closely when the feast begins 
  she nodded assent and magnus walked
away and through the door came edvard
and thyra again and they stopped at the
bottom of the flight of stone steps and for
a moment whispered together then the
jarls daughter hurried up to her room
while edvard haakonsson his face radiant
turned aside to mingle with the men
chapter xi
witchs brew
throughout the remainder of the
day great preparations were made for
the big feast that was to cement a
friendship harald the just entertained
svend in his own quarters while his lieu-

argosy-allstory weekly
tenants made sure that everything was in
readiness
   the warriors mingled tried tests of skill
played at rough sports and bathed in the
stream at the back of haralds house the
shield maidens gossiped and rested svends
thralls aided their brothers of the household
of ilarald stealing scraps of food when they
could none knew better than the thralls
the glory of a great feast
  in her own room thyra consulted with
solveig her old nurse
  solveig was a wrinkled hag of uncertain
years a daughter of thralls but she had
been selected as nurse when thyras mother
had died and harald had refused to wed
again and between the jarfs daughter and
the wrinkled nurse was a love that was deep
and understanding
  and now as to a mother thyra went to
solveig and with flaming cheeks and bright
eyes confessed her secret the ancient
nurse grunted and sat in a corner of the
room rocking back and forth on her heels
after a time she went to the fireplace and
threw sticks on the fire and squatted there
and peered into the flames
   what do you see solveig thyra
asked kneeling beside her
    his love is good the nurse grunted
   i give you thanks for those sweet
words
   but there will be trouble
   trouble thyra gasped
   danger blood will flow
  thyra stopped her with a cry  sol-
veig you frighten me she said
    i read it in the flames jarls daughter
   and what else
    i cannot see well but his love is good
though danger will come
   danger to him
   i cannot tell it is growing dark the
old nurse said and got up and left the fire-
place
  thyra the jarls daughter paced around
the room the words of the nurse had
troubled her she was a christian yet had
not entirely shaken herself free of witch
lore and old solveig many times had
spoken of things that were to happen and
they did
  for a time she was quiet with her trou-
bles then she opened the door and looked
down into the great hall edvard haakons-
son was not far away and when she de-
scended the steps he hurried forward to
join her brynhild saw them and slipped
near crouching at the side of the steps
she could hear
  beloved edvard whispered
 i am troubled ax thrower thyra
said  my nurse can look into the future
she has looked this day she says that your
love is good-but that there is danger near
 danger he repeated
   grave danger from her manner she
told me that blood will flow i asked her
whether the danger was to you but she
could not tell
   do not let her words trouble you
   but they do edvard and i cannot help
it i fear for you so attend beloved
near the house lives a witch an old hag
who has the gift men say i-i cannot
believe in such things yet she has some
wonderful power if you could see her
perhaps she could tell you more
   you would have me visit a witch-you
a christian
   only that we may look into the future
for loves sake she whispered in reply
 that is not the same thing as having her
brew confusion to your enemies you fol-
low the forest trail ax thrower and after a
time you come to a stream her hut is
beside the stream it is not a long dis-
tance you could return in time for the
feast
  a moment he looked at her then he
smiled
   it is a command thyra he said  i
go at once and do you return to your
nurse and not worry about this business
she glided back up the steps and ed-
vard haakonsson hurried from the great
hall brynhild searched until she found
magnus and called him aside she spoke
rapidly and in whispers
   he has walked into my hands mag-
nus said  ill attend to him
  but magnus was troubled as he hurried
away to call one of his trusted men-at-
arms for the warriors even now should
be approaching through the woods and ed-
vard haakonsson might meet them then
the black jarl

would the fat be in the fire so magnus
gave his trusted man orders and the fellow
left the house and made his way slowly to
the edge of the forest and when he had
reached it he plunged from sight to seek
those coming from svends place
  edvard the ax thrower found the end of
the forest trail and made his way along it
rapidly it was no more than a leafy tun-
nel the bottom worn smooth by the feet of
thralls soon he was in the stillness of the
deep woods where there was naught to be
heard save the whispering of the wind
through the trees and sounds from forest
life
  on he went and presently he reached
the stream he found the witchs hut half
hidden by brush and approached it slowly
there was a fire before it and over the
fire a large pot but the door of the hut
was closed and there was no human to be
seen
  edvard hesitated a moment and then
went up to the door he took his dagger
out of his girdle and pounded upon the
door with the hilt of the weapon a croak-
ing voice sounded behind him
   what does the jarl wish it asked
edvard haakonsson whirled at the
sound the witch had slipped from the
woods and now stood beside the boiling
pot her thin hair stringing down from her
head her bent body supported by a crooked
stick she leaned forward and tilted her
wrinkled chin and her tiny eyes gleamed at
him
   what does the black jarl wish she
asked  never have i seen you before yet
 knew that you would come
  how did you know that edvard
asked
   old dagmar knows many things that
other folks do not if you have nothing to
ask of me go your way
  if you know so much edvard said
 perhaps you know what knowledge i seek
without me telling you
   you would look into the future she
said
   and can you show it me
   if the eyes of the jarl are good per-
chance he can see cor himself
  edvard started toward the boiling pot
but she threw up her crooked stick and
stopped him
 is there no reward she demanded
the ax thrower laughed and gave a
bracelet from his arm the old hag cackled
drew back the stick and motioned toward
the pot
  edvard drew nearer and looked down at
the steaming mess
  closer dagmar whispered look
closer jarl the future may be seen only
by those who wish to see it
   i see nothing but boiling stuff covered
with a scum
   look well at the scum jarl the old
witch was beside him now bending forward
 look jarl you love a maid but she soon
will be in peril you must fight to protect
her look again jarl there is blood in
the air there is strife abroad before the
night is over men will die your own life
is threatened and that of the maid you
love
  edvard haakonsson gave a cry and cov-
ered his eyes with his arm whether he
saw it or not he believed that he did
he bent forward again and looked at the
foaming stuff in the pot
   beware those you think are your
friends the old hag croaked  put not
your trust in any man during the night that
is coming even now the forces of evil are
gathering c-uard well yourself and the
maid you love
   tell me more he commanded
   i cannot tell you what is not shown
jarl sharpen your ax i can tell you that
much-sharpen your ax
  more he commanded again looking
at the scum in the pot
   then look jarl
   i see nothing
   that is because you cannot read let
dagmar read it for you jarl you are now
in your own right double jarl you may
be soon
   what is the meaning of that
   ruler over two jarldoms she said
 that is all mighty one
  he backed away from the pot looked at
her then whirled and darted back along the
forest trail he felt forced to believe
ruler over two jarldoms did that mean

argosy-allstory weekly
his own and the jarldom of harald the
just was thyras father to be slain and
he to rule by virtue of marriage with har-
alds daughter
  dagmar predicted strife did she mean
that svend would break the law of hos-
pitality and commence an attack but he
put aside that thought as unworthy per-
haps the danger to himself would come from
personal enemies he thought and she
might have meant that he would rule over
two jarldoms after svends death as was to
be expected if he outlived svend
  he hurried along the trail his head bent
on his chest it was almost dark now and
soon the feast would begin and he had to
be there for that and wanted a private
word with thyra first he sprang across a
brook darted over rocks and once more
followed the well worn trail
  and suddenly men sprang out at him
ovewhelmed him and made him prisoner
before he could reach his dagger then
he was pulled back into the brush still
struggling and trying to fight a skin was
thrown over his head half smothering him
blinding him
   fiends  he gasped  what treachery
is this
  but the skin over his head muffled his
voice
chapter xii
masks removed
his captors held him fast upon the
ground while they lashed his ankles
with thongs and fastened his wrists
behind his back and then they lifted him
and carried him for a distance through the
woods and finally put him down again he
could hear the whisperings of many men
and the crackling of burning twigs-could
feel the heat of a small fire
  he twisted and struggled and after a
time one of the men went forward and
whipped the skin from around his head
edvard haakonsson whirled to one side
and managed to sit up against the bole of a
tree
   what means this treachery he de-
manded
  in the semigloom he could see nothing at
first save the dusky and uncertain forms of
moving men that they were warriors he
saw at a glance for axes flashed in the
reflection from the fire and he saw shields
and spears and bows
  none of them gave him answer he rest-
ed for a moment and then managed to get
to his feet and there he leaned against the
tree and tugged at his bonds to find that
his captors had done their work well in-
deed
   what means this he demanded once
more
  a man stepped up beside him and ed-
vard saw in surprise that he was one of
svends warriors a lieutenant who had been
left behind at svends house
   we have but obeyed orders jarl he
said  do not hold it against us
   what orders and who are these men
what do you here
   one comes who will tell you all the
warrior replied
   you were told so to take me
   we were so told jarl commanded to
make a captive of you as you came back
through the woods
   loose me instantly edvard command-
ed  whose orders can be greater than
mine
    svend is our jarl
   then these orders came from svend
edvard asked in surprise
   not from svend perhaps but with his
sanction the warrior replied  one will
come soon to explain it all
  edvard thought on that for a moment
but he was not compelled to think for long
a guard called a low-voiced warning and
was answered and magnus strode into the
little clearing by the fire
  magnus there was venom in ed-
vards voice now  what means this
treachery
  magnus leered at him and stood close
his fists braced against his hips
    it is by svends permission he said
   why am i taken captive like an
enemy edvard demanded did you
issue the order
    i did jarl
   by what authority
the black jarl

   by the permission of svend the bloody
i have said
   what means it
   now we come to the question mag-
nus declared stepping a pace closer
  i demand an answer
   it is unusual for a prisoner to demand
but under the circumstances i am disposed
to reply magnus said his words and
manner were without respect yet he felt
sure of his ground now  you saw fit to
take a stroll through the woods it was
intended that you should remain in the big
house for strolling through the woods
you met with something of which you
should not have known-these good war-
riors of svends
   what means their presence here
   can you not guess magnus asked
 did you think that svend the bloody
meant to cement friendship with harald the
just this kind invitation of haralds for
a visit but opened the way
   you mean treachery edvard gasped
 i mean that when the feast begins jarl
a signal will be given and then our men
in the house and these of our forces out-
side will rush to combat and work their
will upon harald and his place
   you mean an attack
   more than that jarl-a victory for
odin and thor you were not told be-
cause svend feared to trust you and with
good reason it seems for you have looked
upon haralds daughter with eyes of love
one has observed you even now you have
been paying a visit to some witch at her
command you might take it amiss that
svend slay harald and wreck his house
love ofttimes makes a fool of a man and
causes him to forget his kin
   and would i want to forget my kinsman
if he did such a thing edvard haakons-
son declared hotly  does not svend
know the laws of hospitality
   he is big enough man to break them
when it serves his purpose to do so mag-
nus said
   no man is big enough to do that the
black jarl declared  loose me
   it is not time magnus said
   what mean you
  to thor shall be the victory and
every good soldier knows the value of sur-
prise you love the maid and your heart
is not in our plans were you to be freed
you might rush to the house of harald and
give the alarm
    it is true that i might
   so here you remain a prisoner until
the signal for attack is given then you
will be freed and may join in the battle
but our plans cannot be wrecked when
they have gone so far
   i shall hold you to account for this 
   when thor triumphs then i shall be
at your service jarl i return now to the
house rest easy in your bonds for the sig-
nal soon will be given
  without another word magnus turned his
back disrespectfully and disappeared in the
darkness
  once more edvard haakonsson tugged at
his bonds and knew that he could not win
free he slumped down to the ground
against the bole of the tree the others
gave him scant attention seemingly afraid
to approach but they watched him from
a little distance to see that he did not
escape
  and now the horror of the thing claimed
him and he knew what the witch had
meant svend had made his plans boldly
harald would be off guard expecting friend-
ship and would receive a blade the men
of svend the bloody would find things
easy for them harald and his warriors
would be struck down and his thralls
flames would complete the work and ed-
vard guessed that the tale would be told
afterward how the quarrel had been start-
ed by harald
  and thyra
  his heart sank when he thought of her
she might be hurt in the battle with none
there to protect her even though she es-
caped would she look once again at svends
nephew
  in that moment edvard haakonsson
knew that he had turned against his uncle
and renounced kinship he determined to
fight on the side of harald though it cost
him his life he would protect the woman
he loved even against svend the bloody
for svend was breaking sacred laws in the
name of odin and thor
g
argosy-allstory weekly
  again he tugged at his bonds and knew
that he could not free himself but he did
not entirely despair when the attack be-
gan then would he be freed he could rush
to the house with the others and wield
blade at least he could take his stand in
front of thyra and serve her to the end
  the warriors about him seemed like shad-
ows in the woods the tiny fire had died
down to a mass of glowing embers svends
men knew that he was secure and were giv-
ing him no attention they were looking to
their weapons eager for the fray talking of
the loot they would have and the enemies
they would slay curses for harald and his
house were upon their lips
  edvard haakonsson heard a slight noise
behind him but thought nothing of it
some animal of the forest attracted by the
fire he believed but presently he heard
a hiss and his body stiffened
   master  came a whisper  it is eric
i followed as you said
  edvard haakonsson thrilled at the words
 the dagger in my belt-take it he whis-
pered loose me
  a hand came out of the darkness behind
the trees and tugged at the belt edvard
felt the dagger slip loose
  have a care he warned his lips
scarcely moving  and work with speed 
he felt the thongs around his wrist give
as they were slashed his hands came free
he reached back and took the dagger from
eric and then waited a bit
   be ready to run eric he whispered
 as soon as i have freed my ankles
  he made sure that none of the warriors
was looking at him then his hands came
swiftly from behind his back and he slashed
with the dagger the thongs fell from his
ankles and he sprang to his feet
  a warrior turned and saw him gave cry
and several men plunged toward the black
jarl but they were too late edvard
haakonsson crashed through the brush and
so gained the trail eric the dumb at his
heels and rushed along it toward the house
of harald
  an arrow sped past him but he heeded
it not he bent lower ran swifter the
shouts of pursuit died down on he ran
stumbling over tangling vines and rocks
and finally he came to the edge of the clear-
ing before the house of harald-but too
late
  for even as he dashed from the woods
a man standing beside the great gates waved
a torch above his head from the big hall
came the din of combat and from the
forest poured the warriors of svend the
bloody to join in the fray
chapter xiii
roar of battle
arald the just had prepared a
feast of feasts torches were set
thick against the walls on the dais
was haralds seat and beside it one es-
pecially constructed for svend then came
one for edvard haakonsson and down the
side of the long table places for the men
according to their rank to haralds left
were the seats for the women commencing
with his fair daughter next thyra was a
place for brynhild chief of svends
maidens
  odors of roast meat filled the great room
as the guests gathered svend the bloody
walked across with harald and took his
seat magnus just returned from the
woods gave svend a look that spoke vol-
umes and then turned away but he whis-
pered to brynhild and in turn she spoke to
her maidens bidding them flee into the
woods if trouble began
   your kinsman is absent harald said
to svend
  thyra too had noticed his absence but
she thought only that he had been delayed
on his visit to the witch
   perhaps he will come soon svend re-
plied to harald  you need not await him
he is a man of moods and no doubt is out
by one of the fires watching the thralls at
play
  so harald gave the sign and the com-
pany was seated a procession of thralls
entered carrying huge platters of meat and
heaping the long tables with food and fill-
ing the goblets roast oxen swine sheep
and fowls were placed before the guests
but not horse meat since harald was a
christian
the black jarl

  standing in his place harald the just
made sure that everything was as he had
ordered and men and women waited for
him to speak before eating
   this is the feast i long have wished to
serve harald said  it means that friend-
ship and not war shall abide hereafter be-
tween us and our neighbors too long have
we met only for violence and now let us
meet in peace
  svends face remained inscrutable but it
seemed that magnus was like to choke
all eyes were upon harald the just
   jarl he said tinning toward svend
the bloody  our religions are not the same
so we must be tolerant toward each other
it is a custom of the christians when they
sit down to meat to give thanks to their
god for his bounty i and my people ob-
serve this custom
   you would observe it now svend
cried
   no insult is intended jarl
  yet i see one in it svend declared
hotly he thought that here was an ex-
cuse ready made for him  we are your
guests yet you would hurl your queer cere-
monies at us you would pray to your
strange god in our presence 
  peace harald said holding up his
hand
   how can there be peace in the face of
this svend cried  think you i am a
craven jarl to let such a thing pass un-
noticed think you i would let an an-
cient enemy flaunt me so
   peace neighbor
  but svend the bloody sprang to his feet
his eyes suddenly were blazing with the
frenzy of a fanatic
   i hold to the gods of my fathers  he
cried  i recognize none other nor allow
others to do so in my presence thor
  it was the signal magnus turned quick-
ly and waved his hand to a man standing
near the door that man sprang outside
grasped a torch and whirled it thrice above
his head
   thor cried magnus
  thor odin and thor shouted
svends men
  svend the bloody sprang backward and
darted from the dais and a waiting war-
rior handed him sword and shield back
to the walls darted the men to grasp their
shields and weapons
   thor strike for thor svend shout-
ed  thor is with us
  and so the battle began
  there was a deal of turmoil yet not so
much as might have been expected svend
and some of his men noticed at the mo-
ment that weapons had appeared as though
by a miracle in the hands of haralds men
and then svend guessed that harald had
feared this thing and had prepared for it
so as not to be caught off guard
  the women scattered like leaves before
a high wind brynhild and her maidens
ran for the door and won through to the
woods haralds women ran shrieking for
the stairs and the landing thyra among
them up the steps they rushed and into
the rooms and there they barred the heavy
doors
   strike strike for the cross harald
was shouting
  thralls ran screaming toward the doors
to be met by svends men and cut down
arrows flew swords crashed against
shields javelins flashed across the great
hall spears clattered against the walls
  into this melee rushed edvard haakons-
son his face aflame with rage a single
glance was enough to show him that the
thing had gone beyond remedy already
dead and wounded men were stretched on
the floor the great tables had been over-
turned haralds food was scattered and
not even a hound stopped to claim it
  edvards first thought was for thyra and
he saw with happiness that none of the
women remained in the great hall he
would grasp a shield he decided and fight
his way to the bottom of the steps there to
guard her
  he picked up the first shield that came
to his hand and drew his sword close be-
hind him eric armed himself from a dead
man together side by side they fought
their way across the wide room struggling
to reach the bottom of the stairs
  and now edvard haakonsson discov-
ered a queer thing-that svends men were
trying to cut him down there could be
no mistake about it men who knew him

argosy-allstory weekly
slashed at him as they passed once he
caught sight of the grim face of magnus
and saw the evil gloating in it
  and haralds men naturally turned
their blades against him also edvard
haakonsson stood alone surrounded by his
foes save for eric the dumb there was
none to stand back to back with him
  days before he had sensed that svend
loved him not he had not taken the trou-
ble to seek the reason for it nor did he
now he whirled his blade around his head
and started to carve his way to the bottom
of the flight of steps
  haralds men had shown themselves to
be no weaklings even to the frenzied
svend it appeared that haralds warriors
had been prepared and that they were to
be reckoned with in the battle with the
men from the woods in the place the forces
were about equal
  but haralds men were fighting on terri-
tory they knew well and their cause was
just they rallied to their chieftains call
and smote their enemies man after man
went down before them svend the bloody
called a rally in vain
  edvard haakonsson attempted to avoid
slaying since he did not wish to cut down
one of the house of harald nor a man of
his uncles but soon he found that he
could not they pressed him into a comer
and he won free with eric he saw mag-
nus fighting to get near him and realized
the mans intent
  thor thor svend was shouting
  thor give us strength
  escaping thralls had met with svends
thralls and outside the house they were
fighting outbuildings burst into flame
shrieks and cries of pain and howls for
mercy rent the air
  edvard haakonsson found himself in a
corner again and started to follow a wall
he wanted only to be near thyra should
there be danger for her either from svends
men or the flames from the corners of his
eyes he saw that the battle was slowly going
against svend the bloody haralds men
stood firm and their blades were red with
the blood of their foes
  thor thor svends men bellowed
  through the cutting slashing throng ed-
vard fought his way crying to eric to fol-
low he was more than halfway across the
big room now if he could reach the steps
he felt that he could hold them against all
comers unless an arrow shot him down
  and suddenly he found himself on the
edge of a group of svends men and svend
himself in command svend had been try-
ing to reach harald the just but had not
been able to do so harald was against the
opposite wall fighting as well as any of his
followers he turned and looked at them
his eyes flaming
   thor thor rang the shouts
   the cross 
  there was no pretense now it was thor
against the cross and all men knew it and
they knew also that svend the bloody had
planned this thing but svends plans were
not working out as he had expected he
was separated from magnus or he would
have given fresh orders he saw his men
falling on every side svend had been in
too many battles not to read the outcome
harald and his men were to be victors
  so this was the end to die was bad
enough but to die at the hand of an ancient
enemy was worse in that moment svend
the bloody became a maniac the hot
blood surged through his veins
  strike he shrieked strike for
thor
  and so edvard haakonsson met him face
to face
   kinsman call away your men the
black jarl cried  you are outdone it is
a penalty for the treachery you tried
   you- svend the bloody whirled to-
ward him  a curse on the day you came
out of the south he cried  man with
the heart of a woman
  he flung the others aside and his blade
was raised edvard haakonsson darted
backward to save his life and to keep from
slaying his uncle
  svend would have followed but he did
not for as the others turned to meet fresh
foes and let svend settle this family affair
svend found himself confronted by a new
enemy-a man with blazing eyes and pro-
truding tongue eric the dumb
  it was enough for eric that he had seen
svend raise blade against edvard haak-
the black jarl

onsson but there was more than that far
back in his memory eric had a flash of a
scene in svends own house when the
bloody one had slain a thrall with a single
blow of his fist
  eric raised the blade he held back-
ward he sprang and then launched himself
forward he had no method of fighting
but he had great strength more through
good fortune than skill did he avoid svends
biting blade and his own swept through
the arc-and svend the bloody died
  then eric whirled around to find that his
master was hard pressed by a circle of foes
he bellowed like a beast and charged
blades bit at him and brought the blood
-but they did not stop him he won to
edvards side and together they fought
their way on to the wall
 see edvard commanded that
door behind it eric is the maid i love
stand before the door and let no man
enter i will care for myself 
  there was no need of a second command
perhaps eric did not understand the full
import of it but he had heard the words
he was to stand on the landing at the top
of the flight of steps before the door and
allow no man to ascend
  he charged through the crowd of fren-
zied fighting men and won to the steps
he cleared them of foes and took up his
station below him the battle continued
svends men were in little groups now their
backs to the walls being slowly cut down
magnus was still in the fighting but his
cries failed to rally the men who remained
the battle was lost and they knew it well
and in the face of outraged hospitality they
could expect no quarter from haralds men
they could only fight on until they died
like other men before them they had fol-
lowed an unworthy leader and now were to
pay for it
  for an instant magnus found himself
alone he glanced quickly around the
room he saw the flight of steps and the
landing at the top of them and the door
beyond he saw eric too but thought
nothing of that
  if he could force his way up those steps
perhaps he could manage to break into the
room he thought there he could barricade
himself possibly escape possibly even find
the jarls daughter and hold her as hostage
for his own freedom after the fight
  he rushed to the steps and up them he
started eric the dumb growled a menace
and magnus snarled his laughter often he
had cuffed eric aside when eric had been
a thrall but it was a different eric he
faced now-eric the free man who was
remembering the wrongs he had suffered at
the hands of many including magnus
eric who had been commanded by edvard
haakonsson to let none up the steps and
through the door
  -magnus whirled his blade and advanced
and eric met him squarely and thus they
fought on the landing while edvard the
ax thrower watching from a little distance
struggled to get to the scene magnus he
believed meant danger to thyra
  never before in his life had svends big
lieutenant been so surprised as he was now
he faced a maniac who had no skill with
the blade but who had great strength and
determination he felt himself starting to
give way and called all his skill and courage
into being
  again he attacked and eric swung his
blade in a great arc and struck him down
a startled expression came into magnuss
face he braced himself against the wall
the wound was a bad one but not mortal
and so once more he rushed to the attack
  but edvard haakonsson was at the foot
of the flight of steps now he shouted to
eric but eric did not hear the dumb
one exposed himself to make another great
sweep of his blade and this time it bit
home and magnus toppled and fell head-
long down the steps
  the ax thrower was beside eric in an in-
stant now that the battle below was ebb-
ing now that he had won his way across
the hall he wanted to make certain of thy-
ras safety he rushed to the door and tried
it it was fastened upon the inside and he
knew that it was useless to call-that she
could not hear him above the din he would
have to break in
   guard the steps  he commanded eric
  an arrow sped past his head and thudded
into the door and a spear followed har-
alds men had seen him nor guessed his real

argosy-allstory weekly
intention they thought only that he in-
tended harm to the daughter of their jarl
  and brynhild saw him too she had
come back to the house from the woods like
a female warrior she had crept into the
great hall to find that svend the bloody
was dead and that svends men fast were
being conquered and so she had looked
around for magnus and for the black
jarl
  so it was that she saw magnus go down
and edvard haakonsson dash up the steps
and now black rage surged in her heart at
the man who had turned his back on her
beauty and had looked with eager eyes at
the white faced daughter of the christian
jarl she seized a spear and hurled it with
all her strength
  her aim was good but fortune was
against her and with the ax thrower for
as the spear sped he stepped back to hurl
himself against the door and the weapon
flashed before his eyes like a streak of
flame and thudded into the breast of eric
the dumb
   master master the man gasped
  he dropped to the landing and his blood
wet it a little pool collected in front of
the door and the black jarl stepped back
to hurl himself forward again
chapter xiv
the sign of the cross
thyra had moved mechanically and
as though numbed through the tragic
events of the hour
  one moment she had been sitting at table
listening to her father and wishing that
edvard the ax thrower would come to his
seat the next men were at one anothers
throats weapons were clashing death
shrieks rang out
  she scarcely knew how she managed to
get away from the table it seemed that
somebody helped her at first perhaps one
of her fathers men once she remembered
she had stumbled and for a lime had
been beneath the feet of the warriors but
she managed to get to the wall and follow
it to the steps and rush up them and
through the door into her own room
  once inside she put up the bar across
the door then turned and leaned against
it panting frightened her breath coming
in little gasps her bosom heaving the din
of the battle already was like a roar and
beat against her ears like crashing waves on
a rocky coast
  little one little one
  old solveig her nurse hobbled toward
her across the room solveig had not left
the room for she was old and walking a
task with her one of the thralls had
carried her food and she had been eating
when the jarls daughter had entered and
barred the door
  and now thyra turned to the old nurse
as to a protector and threw her arms
around the hag
   it is war again she sobbed  svend
the bloody began it it happened so quick-
ly that i scarce know how it started there
was to have been peace and happiness and
now-
   often have i seen war and heard the
clash of arms the old nurse said  it is
the part of a woman to stand aside and
wait
   there was to have been peace they
touched hands before the king said thyra
 and because my father would have asked
the blessing svend called upon thor and
shouted to his men-at-arms now they are
fighting and dying and i was so happy
but a short time ago
   the young jarl- solveig questioned
 he was not at the table i sent him
to the witch and he had not returned when
the trouble began
   he is of the house of svend
   but he did not know of this thyra
cried  i am sure he did not know of
this if it was prearranged he is the soul
of honor
   many men seem so are so to women
but forget their honor among men
  he did not know thyra declared in
faith  i could have told if he had meant
treachery this will bring a curse upon
svend he has violated the law of hospi-
tality and what will the end be
   a woman can but wait old solveig
said  you have barred the door
   yes i have barred it
the black jarl

   then pray little one-pray that
haralds men drive out the others else
if they do not it would be better for you
to plunge a knife into your bosom svend
will not be merciful to the daughter of the
jarl he hates he might betroth you to one
of his thralls
   solveig oh it could not end so she
cried  if my ax thrower would come to
help
   ha think you he would fight against
his own house
   he is but new come to the land
   but the blood in his veins will speak
 only half of it is the blood of svends
brother she declared faithfully  i have
read his eyes solveig he is good and
noble do not ask me to doubt him
they were silent for a time thyra cring-
ing near the door the old nurse hobbled
back to her corner and her lips moved in
prayer and thus she remained
  now the girl could hear the warriors
clashing at the foot of the flight of steps
 thor thor she heard them shriek
and because of that she deemed that
svends men were having the better of the
fighting she did not know that sometimes
losing men make the greater noise once
she sobbed thinking of her father and once
again because of edvard
  she could not bring herself to believe
that the ax thrower had a part in the
black treachery yet she looked into the
future and failed to see happiness though
her father lived though he and his men
conquered hewould not listen to her love
for edvard haakonsson now
  and so she sobbed because she felt that
she was losing the first and only love in her
life no matter what the outcome of the
battle and then she remembered that she
was the daughter of a jarl
  her little head was lifted quickly and
her eyes were dried anger flamed in them
and strength of purpose she turned quick-
ly and glanced around the room
  she found what she had sought in a
corner stood a great bow such as her
fathers archers used and arrows for it
it was a serviceable bow made by one of
the old men and presented to her on the
new feast day that celebrated the birth of
him they meant when they spoke of the
cross
  there was a dagger in the corner too as
could be found in every room of the great
house thyra hurried to the corner and
took up the dagger and slipped it into her
girdle then she picked up the big bow
  her purpose was clear now if svends
bloody men won the battle she would act
the part of a jarls daughter the bow
would be for the first foe who entered the
room and the dagger for herself never
would svend the bloody carry her in tri-
umph to his jarldom to make a mock of
her
  but the bow was a strong one meant for
a warrior and she could not handle it yet
she found a way she hurried to the great
fireplace where old solveigs little fire of
twigs long since had died and there she
braced the big bow in one end the bottom
of it in a cleft between two rocks of which
the fireplace was built the top she allowed
to remain outside pressed against the man-
tel and so holding it in the middle she
could draw it back
  she tried it and succeeded she placed
one of the arrows on the bowstring and
drew it back with all her strength and
then let it loose again
  one shot she could make she knew
when they battered at the doer she would
draw back the arrow and hold it so aimed
at the opening and when the first foe
entered she would let the arrow go then
there would remain the dagger for herself
  again she rushed across the room and
crouched close beside the door it seemed
to her that the tumult of the fight had
drawn nearer she heard curses and cheer-
ing but she could make out no words to
tell her how the fight was going old
solveig was still praying in the corner and
thyra made shift to say a little prayer also
  she glanced down at the floor and re-
coiled blood was trickling beneath the
door a tiny stream of it followed a crack
and then widened to a tiny pool she drew
away from it covering her eyes with her
hands shivering a bit and then she re-
membered again that she was the daughter
of a jarl
  and then there came a blow against the

argosy-allstory weekly
door as though some warrior had hurled
himself at it
  thyra gave a little cry and rushed back
to the big fireplace she picked up the bow
put the arrow against the string and waited
there came another thud against the door
and she heard a mans voice shouting the
door gave a little the bar across it seemed
to groan in agony
  still another thud and the door gave a
trifle more in a moment it would be tom
open she knew once more her lips moved
in prayer-and then she drew back the
arrow as far as her strength would permit
  another chorus of cries came from the
great hall beyond another clash of weapons
an instant of comparative silence and then
the door was struck with a crash open
it flew a man in armor stood stooped in
it through her half closed eyes thyra
saw him then she let the arrow go
  straight it went and true it struck the
man whirled halfway around and crashed
to the floor of the landing half inside the
room half out the dagger already was in
thyras hand ready for use on her own
tender breast but she did not use it
  one frightened glance she gave and then
screamed with pain for the man her ar-
row had struck was edvard haakonsson
  a moment she stood as though turned
to stone then uie dagger dropped to her
feet across the room she flew and down
upon her knees she went not caring that
her garment soaked up the blood on the
floor
   edvard she cried  edvard
  she brushed against the arrow and it
fell aside but she did not notice that
neither did she notice that the force of the
arrow had not been great enough to make
it pierce his armor he had slipped in the
blood of eric the dumb had crashed back-
ward and his head had struck but she
thought that she had killed him
  again she cried out as though in agony
she had eyes for nothing save the man upon
the floor whose head she was trying to lift
she took off his helmet and threw it aside
the din of the battle was growing less but
she did not notice she heard voices as
though from a distance and among them
that of her father
  and then there came a touch on her arm
and at first she recoiled in horror remem-
bering that she had dropped the dagger
but it was her father who had touched her
he stood before her his face stern and
marked with blood and behind him were
other men of the house of harald
   here is one of the vipers brood har-
ald said  if he is not dead slay him
what do you here my daughter
  one of the men would have pulled ed-
vard outside but she sprang to her feet
and stopped him
   dont you understand she cried  i
have killed him i braced the big bow in
the fireplace and shot the arrow it struck
his breast
   a worthy deed worthy of a jarls wom-
an harald said
  i killed him she wailed
   not yet is he dead said one of the
men
  then away with him harald cried
 work your will on him scum of a
pagan-
  once more she was down upon her knees
pillowing edvards head against her breast
 no-no  she cried
   what is this haralds voice was
stem
   dont you understand i have wound-
ed him and you must not touch him i-
i love him my father
   love him harald the just cried
 love one of the brood of svend
   since that day at the fair she said
weeping again  i love him and he loves
me we have spoken of it perhaps it
was wrong to keep it from you but he
wanted to ask you to-night ask you to let
him wed with me
   can this be my daughter are your
wits asleep harald cried  scum he is
one of svends brood
   nor is he  she screeched  he is
new come to the land
   a part of the black treachery of to-
night
   he did not know i am sure that he
did not know she cried he was not
at the table when it happened-
   he has turned your head this pretty
jarl but well have an end of him
the black jarl

   then it will be the end of me too my
father for if he is slain then will i slay
myself i swear it-on the cross 
  the men recoiled and for a moment har-
ald himself was dumb but he looked down
at the ax thrower again and again was
stern
   he merits death a follower of
thor-
   no no
  she stooped closer over him as though
to protect him from harm her face was
against his her hands were at his throat
fondling it and they touched something
there
  her father bent over to pull her away
but her sharp cry stopped him he looked
down at her and the others also she had
tugged at the thing about his neck beneath
the armor and it was a metal chain she
pulled it forth-and on the end of it was a
crucifix
 see  she cried  he wears the cross 
the cross harald cried nephew
of svend the bloody wear a cross then
it is stolen perhaps-he wears it as a
mockery-
  edvard haakonsson moaned and opened
his eyes he struggled to sit up and thyra
aided him he looked around and smiled
   i fell he said  i slipped in blood
and crashed my head
   no my ax thrower i shot you with
an arrow thyra told him
   then am i content to die-
  but harald stopped it  on your feet
black jarl he cried  men lift him
they jerked him to his feet and he
leaned weakly against the wall the smile
had fled from his face thyra pulled away
from her father and ran to his side and
clung to him
   i love him she said  can you not
understand
  but harald the just was looking straight
into edvards eyes and was deaf jo her
plea
   what have you to say to me black
jarl he demanded  such black treach-
ery-
   i knew nothing of it on my word  the
ax thrower said
   and what is your word worth to me
you knew nothing of it-you svends kins-
man how could he plan it except with
you
   yet he did edvard haakonsson re-
plied  i speak the truth i knew noth-
ing of it until svends men caught me in
the woods and made me prisoner i would
have vvarned you but escaped only just as
the signal was given
   and by whom can you prove this
   by only one man and there he lies-
dead he pointed to the body of eric
   it is poor evidence you a man of
thor-
   i am a christian edvard announced
 always have i been a christian that
was why my father did not return to the
land of his birth to claim his jarldom in
the southland where he met my mother he
turned christian and he was happier there
 how do i know this is not a lie har-
ald demanded  a pagan might lie to
save his lifes blood the cross at your
throat may have been stolen
   think so if you will
   enough of this  harald cried  one
of you pull my daughter away for she is
bewitched and hand me an ax mine own
is missing with my own hands will i slay
the last of the brood of svend in the name
of the cross
  edvard haakonsson stood straight and
tall and pale against the wall his eyes
narrowed as hey pulled the weeping thyra
away and he looked after her with love in
his glance
  harald the just grasped the ax a man
gave him and stood before the black jarl
   it is but justice he said
   would you strike down an unarmed
jarl
  this is an execution jarl you are
not worthy to be met in honorable combat
scum of the svend blood do you even
falter in the face of death
  not i edvard cried  but i crave
an instant before you strike 
  harald held his hand a moment then
slowly raised the ax over his shoulder but
edvard haakonsson was not praying to
odin for aid the smile touched his lips
again he raised his right hand and swiftly
he made the sign of the cross

argosy-allstory weekly
  strike harald surnamed the just
his voice rang out  strike through that
sign-if you dare
  the ax fell to the floor harald the just
stepped a pace backward
   you-you- he gasped  you are-
indeed-a christian
   i have spoken truth blind man can
you see now
  a sudden tumult in the great hall below
men were cheering and there came the
tramping of many feet harald the just
and his men whirled as though to face new
foes and thyra crept forward again and
into the shelter of edvards arms
  and in upon them walked-olaf trygves-
son
   hail harald said the king  had
some inkling of this and hurried hence with
warriors to give you aid but you needed
no aid it se-ems and what is this my
black jarl you would have slain him
had i not found him a christian
harald said
the
   give thanks that you did not i am
convinced that he knew nothing of this
treachery i do know that svend even
plotted against him to get his estates and
now he may have his own and svends also
the day you left the fair a ship out in
from the south and brought me news of
this black jarl a good christian he is
and always has been and he is our friend 
   i am glad i stayed my hand harald
said
  but olaf trygvesson had turned to the
ax thrower
   claim your estates weed out the un-
worthy and build your house anew ed-
vard my friend he said  ill lend you
warriors and when yob have done those
things come to me at trondhjem like a
good christian and help me build my
church
  he paused a moment and his eyes twin-
kled as he looked down at thyra
   and when you come to trondhjem
black jarl bring your bride with you he
added  it is our royal command

when the phonograph plays
     i like to fold my hands and close my eyes
and think of the days
when the babies had croup and each sunrise
brought so much work i used to cry
thinking it would never be done
and the farm hands there was such a crowd i would lie
awake nights thinking of to-morrows task
and praying the lord to lighten the load
if only by one
now ive got what i asked
we ought to be careful about what we pray
theres no crowd now we found coal on the land
there are no children to quarrel and play-
no croup though at night i dont sleep
thinking on to-morrow-not how much milk
i can get from the new cow
or how i can keep
the tomatoes to can another day

hearted judge in the state of arizona
m  because i wanted to talk to you man
to man here in my office i thought you
wouldnt profit greatly by a preachment be-
fore everybody in the court room rio
   im very much obliged to you for that
quickly replied the six feet of sunburned
but good looking sometimes stubborn
young manhood that the cow country in-
sisted upon calling  rio jack  instead of
plain john bverly
  the judge resumed in a fatherly man-
ner
   youre a striking specimen of fine red
blood gone wild rio and youd better go
somewhere else and flip a new leaf in the
pamphlet of life  hardly know where to
advise you to go for it seems that the news-
papers everywhere have saddled a devil of
a reputation on you-and you earned part
of it you really must cut out your buck-
wildness son you barely came clear to-
 a
day all that saved you was flaws in the
evidence and a mercifully inclined jury
rio
   man to man judge you said frowned
byerly his eyes narrow and bright  i
want you to know that i was guilty of only
two of the holdups and that i didnt profit
a red cent by eith-r of them whitson
was hounding an old woman to death for
a debt she didnt rightly owe him and i
took barely enough of his money to pay it
off the railroads lawyer compromised
with jim faidleys fool wife for three hun-
dred dollars after jim was killed i stuck
up the pay roll car and took twenty-seven
hundred more for her-insinuated that i
owed it to jim you see thats all maybe
it wont be so hard to begin over the
papers never had my picture you know
   then you will make another start
rio the older man rose and put out his
hand
  byerly took it gratefully

   i will if its humanly possible rio
jack promised in a soft drawl that was
southern rather than western  much
obliged to you sir and good-by and good
luck
  he put on his wide rimmed high peaked
stetson and walked out his silver spurs
jangling musically on the heels of his span-
ish boots it was growing dark and the
shapes of his and his pals horses were
indistinct at the hitching rack the dim
figure of old top wiggins detached itself
from near-by shadows and moved forward
like steel toward a magnet it is a simile
that fits beautifully byeriy always ad-
dressed his pal bv the englishy term  old
top
  this odd pair had read english fiction
everlastingly their shanty on no gold
creek in the scrub was full of it
   what did he want with yuh rio
asked wiggins
  byeriy told it briefly
  wiggins drew from inside his brown shirt
a crumpled newspaper which he had just
purloined from the lobby of a hotel a short
distance down the street he unfolded it
lighted a match and called byerlys atten-
tion to a paragraph among the personals
  joht l a byerly-communicate at
  once with envard  ervvard attorneys
  atlanta georgia much to your advantage
   there rio said old top wiggins
 is yuh new leaf mebbe whats the
	l a in yuh name for louisiana
  byeriy smiled  lord and annesley
lord is an old family name and annesley
was the name of the methodist bishop who
had the honor of christening me how
much money have we got in the treasury
old top
  wiggins was grinning in the dusk  lord
annesley cripes and here ive been as-
sociatin with royalty and didnt know it
what did yuh say-how much money
after hirin two lawyers yuhve got a nerve
to ask weve got whats in our hosses
saddles bridles and spurs yuh lordship
   theyre dandy horses saddles bridles
and spurs muttered byeriy ignoring wig-
ginss fun  they ought to assay a sizable
bank roll old top-eh
   yuh mean-
   well go to atlanta said rio jack
 i think i know whats happened uncle
john is dead and im his heir
  they walked leading their horses to
the telegraph office and byeriy wired er-
ward  erward the following day they
sold their possessions to the highest bidder
at fancy prices and boarded an eastbound
train though neither of them wras yet
twenty-six they had shared each others
wild fortunes and misfortunes for too long
even to think of separating now
ii
  erward  erward had more or less pre-
tentious offices and the erstwhile robin
hood and his shadow in cow country
clothes walked into them with the feeling
that they were distinctly out of place im-
mediately the two were ushered by an ob-
sequious clerk into the inner sanctum of the
elder erward a good and kindly man
   sit down gentlemen he said  now
mr byeriy we shall of course have to es-
tablish your identity youve been sort of
out of pocket since you were about fifteen
i believe
   yes byeriy nodded with a slow smile
 my parents were both dead and if i
remember correctly  had been fairly soak-
ing in a so-cailed book entitled  two gun
bill red ranger of the rockies or the
black terror tracked to doom fifteen
is an impressionable age mr erward
   i see then you realized- began the
old lawyer he stopped as though he feared
to go further with it
  byeriy suddenly looked blue he had
read erwards thoughts quite without ef-
fort
   so the newspapers have had accounts
of it here too eh-my little dash at out-
lawry
   full of it the attorney said  it was
highly romantic for this commercial age
your playing pranks at the expense of offi-
cers and all the rest of it as i was saying
we shall have to establish your identity
  the heir apparent gave without mistake
family names dates of births and demises
and some fifty other small facts he told of
alias his lordship

his bachelor uncles butterfly tattoo scars
moles cataract stiff knee and numerous
idiosyncrasies no further proof of his gen-
uineness being deemed necessary erward
drew from a desk a bundle of papers and
proceeded
   you will remember your boyhood home
in the clearwater river section which
your father sold to your uncle john before
his death it is yours now your uncle
spent his last days in atlanta having the
plantation looked after by an overseer no-
body except an old negro woman is in the
house which is fully furnished its much
as you left it i imagine there was con-
siderable money though i had to spend a
lot of it in advertising through the west for
you i- but whats wrong
  john lord annesley bverly had gone to
his feet had begun to pace the floor gloom-
ily old top wiggins watched him open
mouthed such luck as that and to be wor-
ried over it
  byerly turned to his lawyer
   the clearwater river section is a sec-
tion of the stiffest aristocrats and im an
outlaw-or was one very recently how
will i manage it mr erward ill be taboo
-dont you see i dont want to sell the
place i want to settle there at the old
plantation home and i couldnt have people
always turning up their noses at me how
will i ever manage it mr erward
  the elder erward shook his head he
knew none better that john byerly as
john byerly the rio jack of the news-
papers would indeed be taboo in the ex-
clusive clearwater country that byerly
would be a pariah an outcast in spite of
his goodly possessions and his fine old fam-
ily name
  suddenly old top wiggins shot to his
feet his eyes twinkling and his bronzed face
beaming
   ive got it rio he exclaimed  ive
sure got it go out there as lord annesley
and be that until yuhve proved yuhself a
respectable and law-abidin citizen
  byerly stared at his pal his pal of the
sagebrush and the purple distances er-
ward too stared at wiggins byerly had
enough of the old wild daring left in him
to be interested his new resolutions con-
cerning non-spectacular methods of living
notwithstanding he turned to erward
the latter named person for all of his
years had a thick streak of romance under
his skin
   why not said erward  those are
your middle names and you would hardly
be masquerading unlawfully nobody re-
members your middle names and nobody
will remember your face they know you
only as a boy i can make out a deed
conveying the plantation from john l a
byerly to lord annesley which will be in
your possession and might prove of help
to you after youve made real friends of
the people of course you could tell about
it and they should be sports enough to
take it as a rather good joke you would
have established yourself then byerly you
see so why not indeed i can think of no
better way for you
   ill be valet to your lordship rio
wiggins suggested eagerly his eyes spar-
kling  i can do it all right
   then make out the deed decided john
byerly  from me to myself im lord
annesley until further notice meantime
wiggins and i will go to a haberdashers
and buy rigging that is more in line with
our new stations in the little game of life
the thing i dread most by the way is the
monocle
  so it came to pass that john byerly erst-
while rio jack hereinafter known chiefly
both by outsiders and by us as annesley
or lord annesley together with his true
friend wiggins went to the clearwater
river country in toggery that was as nearly
english as atlantas clothiers could furnish
or procure or have made on short notice
iii
  lord annesley looking the part per-
fectly to those who didnt know the part
very well stepped from an afternoon train
at the town that was the county seat
screwed a monocle into one eye and looked
about him calmly the jaws of the station
loungers and a few other onlookers dropped
annesley turned to wiggins his valet
   ill be seeing after the luggage yuh
lordship anticipated old top

argosy-allstory weekly
   do wiggins have a liveryman cart it
out to byerly hall at once nodded lord
annesley  also hire a conveyance for
ourselves
  wiggins disappeared and a representa-
tive of barronsvilles little news sheet
rushed up pad and pencil in hand annes-
ley filled the reporters ears full and the
man began a series of running leaps toward
the center of town then the eyes of the
star actor in this rather extraordinary mas-
querade sought out a lean iron gray man
with a familiar star on his shirt front a
man who was walking in a desultory
fashion with a heavily built fellow that ap-
parently worshipped at the shrine of dress
  his lordship let the monocle fall to the
length of its ribbon and walked over to the
pair
   how far is it he asked for he himself
didnt quite remember  to the old byerly
plantation
   three miles and three-tenths said the
sheriff
   have you bought it the heavily built
man inquired apprehensively
   yes i am lord annesley gentle-
men
   im garford redding and this is sher-
iff severson the three shook hands  id
have bought that place redding went on
 if id had half a chance i wired erward
	erward to give me the refusal of it damn
em and they didnt that young buck
byerly cut a pretty wide swath in the
west didnt he mr annesley
   not mr annesley lord annesley i-
er-understand that he did through the
newspapers anyway
  garford redding laughed a laugh that
made him seem suddenly mean and old
though he couldnt have been over thirty-
six
    ah i see peerage eh well sever-
son you watch clearwater take some no-
tice theyre not precisely snobs but-oh
you know them severson i wish you good
luck with the plantation my lord but i
fancy you wont have it when you want
to sell let me know arent you pretty
badly sunburned for a lord your lordship
 been in the west a bit drawled
annesley
   see anything of that ring-tailed terror
jack byerly
   a number of times i knew him odd
character that remarkable shot too saw
him shoot the ash off a sheriffs cigar once
hum snorted redding you knew
him and thats how it came that youve got
the plantation
   exactly
   i see by the papers redding pursued
 that the courts acquitted him it was a
travesty upon justice no wonder the
countrys going bolshevik when such
scrapings as john byerly-
  hold cut in annesley he had a
temper and it had flashed red-hot  i
cant hear a man ive known and liked
talked about in any such fashion-
redding sneered  oh you cdwnt you
cawnt eh
  while lord annesley struggled with him-
self garford redding lighted a fat brown
cigar redding tilted the burning end of
his weed at a rakish angle straightened the
huge diamond he wore in his tie looked
annesley up and down winked at the sheriff
and walked off annesley clenched his sun-
burned hands his jaw muscles stood out
in ridges on his tanned cheeks wiggins
came up behind him and touched his arm
respectfully
   dont forget yuhself my lord cau-
tioned -wiggins
  annesley turned toward sheriff severson
who h noted was disposed to be friendly
toward him
   wtio is this garford redding
   to give it to your lordship straight
frowned the officer with a glance toward
reddings disappearing back  he is in a
fine way to become both political and
financial boss of this county he holds
mortgages - gosh knows how many hes
simply got money to feed to the cows made
it gambling in cotton futures not a very
sweet fellow to have for an enemy by the
way which maybe a hint to the wise red-
ding came of a family that used to fight the
byerlys away back years ago every time
they met
   the automobile is waiting yuh lord-
ship pompously announced wiggins
annesley gave the sheriff good day and
alias his
lordship

stepped into a big car that bore a dealers
license number wiggins ensconced him-
self properly beside the driver and they
were off their baggage following aboard a
small truck
  the name redding stuck in annesleys
mind like a splinter of hot iron he re-
called a few hazy facts concerning the old
feud it had been mostly before his time
but he had the impression that it had been
bitter enough and in this he was correct
  byerly hall-every plantation home in
the clearwater section had its more or less
high-sounding name-was a great old house
a little weatherworn now with huge columns
to its veranda and vines and shrubs and
trees everywhere around it lord annesley
stepped from the automobile with a mist
forming before his eyes a sudden rush of
tender boyhood memories threatened seri-
ously to unman him
  once more he saw himself running bare-
foot through the cotton bloom in the bright
sunshine playing lone indian saw his good
old father poring over his bible in the living-
room saw himself kneeling at his mothers
feet at bedtime imploring compassion and
forgiveness for the days shortcomings
when he came to himself old top wiggins
was shaking his arm as few valets have
dared to shake the arm of their masters and
whispering desperately
   rio look look for heavens sake
rio yuh old spavined booty pinto-are
yuh plum blind
  lord annesley saw and gasped coming
toward them from the house down between
two long rows of flowering cape jessamines
like a fairy out of a magicians box was a
young woman-a slender but roundish
punishinglv handsome young woman
   good afternoon she greeted though
her manner was that of one who owned the
ground beneath her feet--and incidentally
any other ground she might walk upon-
she was as sweet as a bay blossom
  the present owner of the old byerly
plantation took off his soft hat and wisely
refrained from touching his monocle
   good afternoon he said cordially in
a voice that wiggins thought very distin-
guished he continued  i am lord annes-
ley and i have bought this estate
  you-youve oought it the girl cried
amazedly  why i-i thought-father
wired erward  erward that he would
probably pay a little more than anybody
else offered for the place and i thought wed
surely get it ive been trespassing mr
-mr-lord annesley that is ive been
shaping up your roses i hope you dont
mind that and you wont of course im
lila devine and i-we are your nearest
neighbors to the south of here and you
are really a lord
  she had him there he smiled and didnt
answer because he couldnt bring himself
to lie outright to her old top wiggins
stepped boldly forward with relief for the
situation
   it is really lord annesley he said
and his master effectually concealed a wince
annesley found himself shaking hands with
lila devine talking with her as freely as
though they had known each other right
along now that he came to think of it he
remembered her he had gone to school
with her he had fought for her she had
been his boyhood sweetheart-a slim little
thing in pigtail plaits and prinkly crinkly
knee-length dresses
   we were surprised she told him pres-
ently while wiggins looked on in consider-
able apprehension  when jack byerly
turned out as he did you see we knew
him very well here he was such a nice
boy too though he had a pretty high
temper do you know lord annesley you
somehow remind me of the byerlys they
were much like you tall and strong looking
-much like you
  annesleys gaze wandered he wanted
to confess to her that he was john byerly
the deception was becoming singularly hate-
ful to him now he was human and nor-
mal and therefore not immune to feminine
attractions he had liked lila devine as a
boy and he liked her better now as a man
wiggins cut into his train of thought
   the luggage is here my lord ill see
it into the house
   please do said the master of byerly
hall  miss devine he w-ent on resolv-
ing to go through with the deception be-
cause he saw no decent way out of it  i
think id like to ask your fathers advice

argosy-allstory weekly
about cotton growing do you object to
my walking home with you
   not in the least she smiled  father
will be glad to give you any information he
can im sure hell be glad to have you
for a neighbor you see he was a little
afraid-
  annesley finished it for her  afraid
wild young byeriy would come back here
and terrorize the neighborhood
  lila devine blushed a trifle  thats
just what father said
  it was a mile to the big house of the
devine plantation and they did not permit
conversation to lapse for more than a few
yards of it old betterton devine was not
at home annesley told the girl good-by
at the gate and turned-to face a sneering
garford redding who had but that moment
ridden up astride a beautiful horse of ken-
tucky blood
  good ahftahnoon your ludship
redding mimicked insolently
  out of the corner of his eye annesley
noted that a tiny shadow of resentment bad
crossed the features of the bay blossom
girl he lifted his hat to her again ignor-
ing redding and set out homeward
  aha redding snickered sdeath
methinks-
   garford  lila reproved sharply
annesley could have wept for the black
shame of it how he longed to nick both
of reddings jackass ears with  hunks
of lead or thrash the road with his body
in a hand to hand man to man fight he
knew he could do it easily out on the
rio grande or the pecos or the nueces
they wouldnt have staked a single dollar
against a hundred thousand on redding in
any kind of battle with rio jack
but annesley didnt even look backward
  garford  he muttered as he turned
in at his own gate  she called him  gar-
ford but perhaps hes sort of friend of
the family
  mrs betterton devine would have agreed
very readily that redding was a friend to
the family and a warm and true one old
betterton devine himself a mans man
tolerated redding for the sake of keeping
argument and ill feeling out of his domestic
circle so did his daughter
  on the upper veranda step at byeriy
hall an old and corpulent negress sat wait-
ing for lord annesley she looked bereft
her black face a picture of poignant grief
annesley remembered her very well it was
mammy lucinda who had more than once
tied up stubbed bare toes for him
   whats the matter aunty he asked
  she rose with many groans that bespoke
rheumatic joints and glowered at him in
pitiable defiance
   heah you is she clipped i is
spectin young misto john and heah you
is mah po lil baby john wich i used
to nuss on mah lap-dey says he wild and
a outlawyer and evvything but i knows
he aint be dam to me ef i aint jes got
to cuss mah lawd mali lawd is i
gwine stay heah and say  mah lawd  to
you you lowdown po white trashness i
shoiy aint i gits out right now dis in-
stinct i aint got no place to lay mah po
ole haid but i aint gwine stay heah wid no
lowdown po white trashness suh 
  iron man that this last byeriy was her
affection-born vehemence drove a dimness
into his eyes he took her by an arm and
led her into the old living room which was
deserted save for them-he could hear wig-
gins pounding around somewhere else be-
fore the high old floor clock he stopped her
   ill have to let you into my fool secret
mammy lucinda he half whispered
 im john byeriy myself
   you aint she stormed it was fixed
in her mind that he wasnt
  he pointed to the silent old clock
   who he smiled  used to cry for
that
 mammy lucinda stared  who he
pursued  used to steal your pies and
climb into the mulberry tree to eat them
and who once blacked his face with shoe-
black and got a whipping for it and who
smoked his grandfathers pipe and got sick
over it and-whose middle names in the
old bible there are lord and annesley
  convinced mammy lucinda held a little
jubilee of her own then she crossed her
heart that she wouldnt tell until the proper
time came-and she didnt
  soon the stentorian voice of old top
wiggins rang out
alias his lordship

   my lord a gentleman to see yuh at the
gate
  annesley walked down to where gar-
iord redding sat his horse with a wicked
smile on his fattish face wiggins followed
like a shadow and as unobtrusively an-
nesley halted and surveyed the visitor
through his monocle as though that visitor
were an insect
   well my man-
   just wanted to say your ludship
growled redding  that its not best for you
to get it into your royal head that youre
going to be the entire cheese in this neigh-
borhood take warning before some over-
night organization of men finds it expedient
to doll you all up in tar and feathers get
me
  it was not  lord annesley but  rio
jack that took a hasty step toward the
horseman
   dont forget yuhself my lord called
old top wiggins  plainly the man is a
varlet
  annesley stopped turned and went with-
out a word toward the house garford
redding laughed and rode on toward bar-
ronsville at the veranda steps wiggins
caught up with his pal
   look here rio he whispered  yuhre
goin to let loose and spoil the whole hoot-
in match first thing yuh know i want
yuh to trash that goober eater but not now
do yuh tumble old hoss
  his pal laughed  i tumble old top
say im ungodly hungry see what can be
done wont you
  wiggins found mammy lucinda working
so fast in the kitchen in spite of her rheu-
matic joints that she reminded him of
sleight of hand performers that he had seen
iv
  fine summer days passed thirty of them
his bogus lordship chafing all the while
because of the deception-though he felt
sure that it had been built on the best of
excuses had visited and been visited he
had been dined feted lionized made the
reigning figure at countless social functions
if there was a person other than garford
redding and his circle of gay and sporty
intimates who didnt like lord annesley
immensely lord annesley didnt know it
  garford redding was or imagined him-
self to be hopelessly in love with lila
devine now ard his jealousy had developed
from the ordinary kind into an insane or
savage variety to be blocked where he
had been most confident of winning-such
was the colossal conceit of the man-was
as much as he could bear without literally
running amuck
  from the very beginning redding had
openly made sport of annesley and now
that betterton devines daughter showed a
decided preference for annesleys company
redding ran his sport making into sheer
persecution had it not been for his money
and his mortgages especially the latter the
clearwater river people wouldnt have
stood for it but annesley remained an-
nesly through it all though he was bitterly
tempted a score of times to revert to rio
jack he spent solid hours in dreaming of
shooting nicks out of reddings ears and
thrashing him as man has seldom or never
been thrashed before
  then it happened garford redding was
at the bottom of it in fact it was altogether
his idea and he captained its working out
he meant it to be the greatest of annesleys
persecutions
  mrs betterton devine was giving a re-
ception in honor of a niece from macon
and it was to be an eclipsing affair a total-
ly eclipsing affair on the lawn the devine
home had its own little electric plant and
the front grounds were bright with lights
some of them in showy japanese lanterns
hung in festoons from magnolias and oaks
at the last minute garford redding fol-
lowed his carefully built plans and prevailed
upon mrs devine-who as will be remem-
bered was strong for redding anyway-to
permit him to spring an innovation by pull-
ing off a fake hold-up the joke was to bo
on a few sissified and harmless young
swains he said and he himself would notify
the others in advance in order that there
would be no bothersome fainting
  he did notify the others in advance-a
few minutes-all that is except lila de-
vine he wouldnt run the risk of her telling
annesley who of course was one of the

argosy-allstory weekly
 harmless young swains reddings pea-
sized brain had figured that the clearwater
aristocrats would see lord annesley whining
like a whipped puppy down on his knees
and praying for his life before the evenings
amenities were over
  his lordship was formally presented to
the young woman from macon after which
tiny ceremony he found lila devine and
with her stole away to a lawn settee in the
shadows near the front gate at last he
had decided to tell her of the deception
ask her pardon and then-sell his planta-
tion and disappear probably not once did
it occur to him that she might possibly find
him in the right he did not consider that
the naked hearts of queens and charwomen
are alike exactly his former hope that
his masquerade would be laughed off after
he and it became known had tumbled into
gray ruins
  annesley was glad that she could not see
his features clearly his cheeks were on
fire with that which he thought of as his
guilt
   lila he began awkwardly  ive got
a confession to make to you theres small
chance that youll ever forgive me-
  a heavy figure came briskly through the
near-by front gateway it was garford
redding who had just finished giving in-
structions to his eight masked men he
saw lila and her companion and recog-
nized them
  mooning he exclaimed villainous
rage close under his pretended gayety
you two-mooning
  annesleys flush faded quickly he be-
came white he wanted to fly at redding
redding moved on
   that man is detestable quietly said
lila  what were you saying forgive
you but theres nothing to forgive
   there is and much i-you dont
know yet annesley stammered
   but i think i do know she insisted
   w-what
   youre jack byerly
  jack byerlys eyes widened came a
moment of silence between them
   how long have you known lila
   almost from the first lila told him
 you see i remembered your middle
names it was easy for me to find your
reason for that jack and id have done
just as you did and youve behaved your-
self so well in the face of all garford red-
dings r-rotten treatment of you that no-
bodys apt to want to turn you out-except
garford youve been very nice jack in-
deed it was a sort of crucible for you
wasnt it
  byerly rose he stared toward the others
who had gathered around an old negress
fortune teller without really seeing any of
them then he turned back to the girl
   and you remembered he muttered
 that we were sweethearts-a long time
ago
   yes lila devine admitted softly
 you were the only sweetheart ive had
jack-
  she blushed wildly because she hadnt
meant to say quite all that
  soon byerly spoke again
   im going to do this lila and to-night
im going to make a clean breast of it before
everybody and i hope ill be forgiven and
if i am im going to ask you to marry me
  he led her toward the old negress and
her ouija board
  they had barely joined the others when
the watchful garford redding ran his fin-
gers slowly three times through his dark
hair it was a signal immediately the
group was surrounded by men who carried
rifles and revolvers-empty-and wore
blue bandanna masks under broad rimmed
hats
   hands up they called in gruff voices
 hands up-quick
  the order was carried out promptly
garford redding himself led it jack byer-
ly was the last
   women out  the masked men growled
  the women stole hastily toward the ve-
randa
  if byerly had had a few minutes in which
to think the thing over he would have
seen through it as it was he took it all in
deadly earnest those watching from the
veranda saw byerly dart behind a conveni-
ent tree just as the supposed robbers began
to collect watches and purses they saw
byerly go into a rear trouser pocket and
come back with his right hand full of the
alias his lordship

blue steel of an automatic pistol-they
saw him spring from his shelter almost
within the second his voice keen with the
ring of iron and ice
   drop your guns you tin horn robbers
drop em for rio jack
 bang and bang and bang three
masked men dropped their weapons because
their wrists were broken
  he was in their midst now the three
wounded men took to their heels the other
five of the pseudo-highwaymen stood as
though they were frozen stiff redding his
face a pasty ashen hue began to gibber
 it was all a joke annesley-a joke-
dont you see youve crippled nearly half
of them it was a joke-dont you see
confirmation of this came from more re-
liable sources john byeriy threw down the
little pistol that wiggins had persuaded
him to carry as a measure of proteotion and
quietly folded his arms after a few sec-
onds he spoke
   yes redding i see i see very clearly
i was to be the goat you meant to humili-
ate me well redding you neednt shake
like that ill never be rio jack any more
and i wont hurt you without more provo-
cation than ive got now id like to
thrash you ill admit but ive learned con-
trol of myself and there are women near
by now redding im going to make a
sort of speech and id rather you wouldnt
be present you make the atmosphere de-
cidedly bad please take yourself and your
tiny tin holdup artists away wont you
they went shamefacedly redding was
hoist on his own petard
  this last byeriy made his speech and it
was not without eloquence and a fine human
appeal he confessed everything from be-
ginning to end made apologies asked for-
giveness if they felt that it wouldnt cost
them too much and requested to know im-
mediately just where he stood in the ther-
mometer of their regard
  old betterton devine stepped forward-
and stopped but the remembrance of
byerlys persecution and of byerlys stand-
ing up under it like a true man sent him
on he set the clearwater river aristocracy
a good example by wringing the former
pretenders hand most heartily
   speaking for myself john and he
smiled broadly  ill say that the mercury
in the thermometer of my regard for you
is running clean out at the top
  he faced about  ladies and gentlemen
what do i hear
  what he heard was a loud clapping of
hands and to the everlasting credit of mrs
betterton devine she herself touched it off
a little later john lord annesley byeriy
found the bay blossom girl on the lawn in
the shadows near the gate  if you hadnt
asked me she told him after he had spok-
en  i-i think id have asked you and
he reached for her
  it was late that night when he carried the
tidings to old top wiggins old top torn
between happiness and real grief sat up in
bed and both blessed and cursed his pal in
the same breath
   i knowed it he groaned  well rio
yuh old spavined pinto heres good luck
and a velvet trail to yuh both

 co he tied up his loves in an old tump-line

ce august sales were on and crowds
of shoppers surged around the french
blouse counter peering at price tags
fingering models searching for guaranteed
bargains doris kenton stood behind the
counter and shifted wearily from one aching
foot to the other outside the air was fresh
with the first hint of autumn coolness the
sunlight was ruddy with a foretaste of au-
tumn gold inside the electric lights
blazed electric fans whirred elevators
rushed up and down customers elbowed
each other clerks called to cash girls and
floor walkers
  doris spread out a beaded crepe de chine
and smiled mechanically at the woman op-
posite
   very lovely drawled doris she was
thinking of the purple haze that hung over
the hudson when she went to work that
morning it had reminded her of wyoming
and the smoke of forest fires it had
brought a wave of homesickness and yet
she was eager to see it again she decided
that she would take the bus home even if it
did cost a nickel more and take so much
longer than the subway if only to-morrow
were sunday and she could go out to river-
side park
   it is a good value the customer was
deliberating
   a remarkable value madam far be-
low what it cost us i assure you sighed
doris  very becoming too looks won-
derful with your hair
  doris held the blouse against her own
slim shoulders and lifted her round chin
above the rose-colored folds

a change in the management

   yes i do like it admitted the cus-
tomer
   almost the first of september doris
was thinking  wonder if the old crowd 
be camping up the canon unconsciously
she swept her hand over her smooth coif-
fure rumpling out the brown curls around
her temples the canon in september
rustling leaves yellowing cottonwoods
rusty goldenrod cool nights and a bed of
pine boughs and blankets before a slow log
fire stars blinking through the tree tops
smell of earth and cedar-
   ill take this charge it please and
ill take it with me the customer an-
nounced
   mis-ter mi-iles charge please mis-
ter mi-iles called doris she took the
name and address assured the woman again
that the blouse was a wonderful value and
went in search of the elderly floor walker
it was getting near closing time and it
seemed as if a dozen female voices were
shrilling  mis-ter mi-iles 
   yes miss kenton sorry to keep you
waiting said miles when doris finally
corraled him for the perfunctory o ic of
the womans charge
  she sank down on a divan for a minutes
rest and looked up at miles
   tired to-night he asked
   oh not specially said doris she
looked miles over critically his thin aris-
tocratic face his close-cut gray hair his
perfect clothes
  she was wondering how it would seem
to grow old in a department store to live
year in and year out with the crowds mill-
ing about you with the rushing elevators
the whirring fans the glaring lights al-
ways working with people and yet never
knowing them making casual acquaint-
ances among other clerks and cash girls and
floor walkers and then losing your drifting
friendships in the citys maw of multitudes
  there was gene howard over in the shoe
department he and doris had been fast
friends for a time going about together
meeting for lunch chatting for a stolen
minute or two when business slacked in the
long days now she hadnt seen gene to
talk to him for almost a week and when
she did see him he had a moody absent-
minded air he was slipping out of her
life again just as people were always slip-
ping out of your life in new york
  doris looked in a mirror and put back
the rumpled brown curls around her tem-
ples  guess he was afraid i was falling
in love with him she said to herself with
a hard smile
  back at the counter doris folded away
blouses with skillful fingers kept an eye on
the crowd of shoppers swirling past and
dreamed over old rodeo days old rides over
hills and mountains and wide tawny plains
old dances and moonlit trails back in wy-
oming-two years ago could it be only
two years since she swapped wyoming for
broadway came to new york to go on the
stage and then didnt go
  doris shrugged at the thought of what
had come between her and that care-free
western life first violent ambition the-
atrical employment agencies and near star-
vation then stubbornly waning hope
cheaper rooms worn shoe heels and finally
the french blouse counter receding ambi-
tion and more food off to work in the
morning before she was hardly awake
crowded subway express trains and cus-
tomers customers c-tomers all day
long dusting shelves and boxes folding
blouses showing blouses selling blouses
saying  yes madam a remarkable value
very smart tremendously becoming
looks wonderful with your hair
  now there had been a change in the store
management and a number of the old force
had left or had been discharged reports
of the new firms retrenchment policy had
spread with excited emphasis among the
employees everybody was a bit appre-
hensive a little on edge that was prob-
ably what ailed gene doris was thinking
he was afraid that he might lose his job
but anyway he neednt make that an ex-
cuse for cutting his old friends
  somebody passed her elbow  night
miss doris said miles
   night said doris smiling back at the
friendliness in the floor walkers voice it
was the first time he had called her by her
first name and she liked it it sounded
like home in wyoming nobody called her
miss kenton unless he were an absolute

argosy-allstory weekly
stranger and even then he might make it
miss doris or miss dorrie but wyoming
was different from new york
  a gong shrilled
  the final swirl of customers was eddying
out the doors saleswomen were putting
away stock and getting out night covers
for counters cash girls were scurrying to
cloak rooms floor men were pulling down
window shades checking up sales shutting
off electric fans another day was over
s far as the big department store was con-
cerned and the store force old and young
great and small was making the final spurt
for aching feet tired legs and buzzing
brains in a few minutes the carefully
graded efficiently organized body of work-
ers would be scattered to the four winds
swelling the crowds on buses and subways
and surface cars hurrying home to fur-
nished rooms boarding houses or cozy
apartments according to the diverse posi-
tions on the pay roll
  outside the mellow sunlight was soften-
ing the blue haze was growing deeper along
the river and a faint scent of drying leaves
was caught in the vagrant wind
  from the top of a careening bus doris
looked at the crowded streets without see-
ing them she purled her hat down over
her eyes fastened her neck piece close
under her chin and drank in the cool air
with gasps of enjoyment
  the purple mist the yellowing leaves
the flicking wind took her back to wy-
oming once she had ridden in the annual
 wild west  at cheyenne she didnt
win the championship but she came close
to it her eyes shone as she remembered
the plunging hoofs the dust the cheers
the whirling lariats the smell of leather and
sweating horses men in wide hats and
khaki-colored riding clothes women in
white silk blouses and bright colored ties
and over it all the clear high blue of a
wyoming sky
  yet in spite of her dreaming over the
old days doris did not want to leave new
york she couldnt leave a quitter she
said to herself but she dreaded the pos-
sibility of being turned adrift again a de-
tached atom in the swirling streets a lone-
ly jobless boarder in a cheap room that
she could ill afford to pay for out of scanty
savings again she thought of gene and
wondered what he would do if he left the
store again her heart sank at the memory
of their good times together
ii
  the next day was saturday with the
usual saturday rush women with chil-
dren school-teachers suburbanites-a more
mixed and hectic flood of shoppers than
filled the store during the week doris
found the saturday crowds wearing and
yet they interested her they revealed
more of themselves than the average so-
phisticated buyer of expensive blouses
often they lingered around the counter
 just looking that made some of the
saleswomen furious but doris didnt mind
she could remember the times when she
had liked to  just look when she hadnt
much money to spend and yet enjoyed
seeing what she might buy if she had more
she saw no reason for getting supercilious
over the fact that you sold expensive wares
   wre put the stuff out here for folks to
look at let em look doris would say
when may winn got snippy about custom-
ers who didnt buy anything
   wouldnt it be fun to have a little store
with lots of just ordinary things for ordi-
nary people doris had said to gene how-
ard she liked to sell to people who really
needed the things they bought she got a
vicarious pleasure out of their enjoyment
and she felt sorry for women who looked
longingly at her shimmering blouses and
shook their heads over the prices she
hated to have to tell them that they would
find something less expensive in the base-
ment
  but a little store with most everything
in it like one she remembered out at lara-
mie-a store that you could walk around
in without the sense of exploring a small
city it would be reasonably quiet except
at holiday times and on saturday after-
noons there would be people coming in
day after day that you would get to know
women chatting about school and young-
sters and asking you what the spring and
fall styles were going to be
a change in the management

   something in pale blue yes madam
a beautiful model awfully youthful
very popular with young girls doris
turned to wait on a mother and daughter
 some of the new rose shades are good for
blondes too she suggested glancing at
the daughters blue eyes and yellow hair
  the girls eyes shone at the rainbow
colors doris spread before her and the
mother finally ordered two blouses a blue
and a rose one because the girl couldnt
decide which she liked better
   getting her ready lor college the
woman confided  dont know how ill
get along without her though
  then came a fussy woman who ordered
everything out and bought nothing a
school-teacher who took a simple white
crepe a brisk flapper who demanded egyp-
tian designs so they came young and old
rich and poor and doris waited on them
wistfully anxious to please tn the back
of her mind was the nagging fear of dis-
missal the haggard anticipation of another
search for work
  at noon doris was dizzy with fatigue
miles stopped at the counter and asked
her to go to lunch with him and she ac-
cepted gratefully
   oh thanks mr miles she said
 how did vou know that i was homesick
to-day
  in the dressing room as she rubbed some
rouge into her pale cheeks doris felt a
sudden panic the floor walker was being
unusually kind because he was sorry for
her she decided he knew she was going
to lose her place and he was trying to ease
her disappointment that was it she sat
down shakily as the thought came to her
well anyway it was comforting to find
somebody who cared enough to be sympa-
thetic miles had been in the business all
his life maybe he could help her find an-
other place she would sound him out and
see whether he knew anything
  but at lunch miles refused to be sound-
ed and finally began talking about gene
a clean young chap he observed and a
mighty clever salesman he had known
the boy for years-ever since he came into
the store a green hand oh it must have
been five or six years ago and then miles
talked reminiscently of the old management
and the old days of the ups and downs of
merchandising he had been a silk sales-
man for many years and knew all about
silks from the worm to the sales counter
  doris listened fascinated she had
never thought about all the diverse rami-
fications of a big stores trade it made
her work seem a thousand times more in-
teresting when miles talked about it it
increased her admiration also for the men
who directed and managed a great mercan-
tile enterprise what if they did fire you
they had a mighty big job and they had
to make it pay - youre as good as a
story book she told miles
iii
  she got it that night-the slip in her
pay envelope stating that her services would
be no longer required that on account of
the necessity for cutting down expenses the
force was being reduced that if at any time
in the future there was need for additional
help the management would be glad to
have her back
  it was nicely worded and there was
further explanation that doris did not read
she stuck the crumpled slip in her hand
bag and hurried to collect her things an
extra umbrella that she kept in the locker
a book gene had asked about and that she
had brought to loan him and then didnt
  in the subway jam she nerved herself
against the sense of despondency and de-
feat that swept over her there was no
need to get panicky she knew that new
york was full of department stores and
shops and factories shed find something
else right away to-morrow she would
buy the sunday papers and look up the
ads next week she would strike right out
and search the town before she had a
chance to get blue and scared maybe
shed find something a whole lot better than
she had left maybe she could get into
one of the smaller stores where the work
was less exacting
  at one hundred and sixteenth street
doris left the subway and walked toward
the river she yearned for fresh air and
quiet the park was almost deserted and

argosy-allstory weekly
she walked on until she came to a favorite
bench under a great elm tree the river
was dazzling silver beneath the lowering
sun the trees on the opposite shore were
blue with haze like the smoke of forest
fires but she wasnt thinking of wyoming
to-night she was planning intently on
staying right in new york
   peanuts v cracker jack a small
urchin stood beside her repeating his plaint
and doris gave him a dime and picked two
small bags of peanuts out of his basket
  the boy went on and a saucy gray
squirrel came to share her feast yellowing
leaves drifted down from the giant elm tree
boats whistled on the river and buses
droned along the drive above the vine-cur-
tained wall
  yes she liked new york in spite of the
difficulties in spite of the tiresome neces-
sity of jobs and meal tickets she recalled
the plays she and gene had gone to the
trips to coney their dinners at greenwich
village tea rooms their hikes up the river
  she brushed the saucy squirrel from her
shoulder and opened the second bag of
peanuts then jumped violently at the sound
of a familiar whistle
  down the path came gene waving his
hat and swinging along his brown hair red
in the sunshine a sudden anger swept
doris at the sight of his nonchalance he
was coming to cheer her up and she didnt
want to be cheered up he thought he
could drop her when he pleased and then
come around with crumbs of sympathy
she stiffened her tired shoulders and picked
up her book and umbrella
   hello thought id find you here
he called  its the right old place to
shake the dust of keppel  company from
off your shoes
  he threw his hat on the grass and sank
down beside it  cant you giye a poor
hungry tramp a peanut he begged
   you can have them all im going
home said doris in a sweet cool voice
   come on dont be sore i got it too
   got what
   got canned fired discharged what-
ever term you prefer the shoe depart-
ment at keppel  companys is no longer
eager for my services
  gene produced a slip duplicating the
crumpled one in doriss hand bag and
smiled cheerfully up at the setting sun
 its all right i dont blame em its
their business
  doris sat down on the bench again and
dropped her book and umbrella her
anger vanished as suddenly as it came
 really gene she asked in spite of the
printed evidence before her eyes  why
miles was telling me just to-day what a
clever salesman you are
   was he now well hes a good old
scout
   he said hes known you for years and
never known a mean thing about you
doris continued with a little flush ashamed
of her momentary hostility
  well bless him hes more than a
good scout hes a bully old chief
   you wont have any trouble getting an-
other place doris remarked  with all
your experience
   oh i dont know never worked any-
where else i was tired of that job any-
how have a notion to go west or north
or some place guess i got the wanderlust
hearing you talk about wyoming
   but you know the shoe business said
doris quickly she didnt want gene drift-
ing around out west he wouldnt like it
and he was a born salesman
   well i dont know dont much care
for this business of bein hired and fired
kind of imagine id like to do something
on my own have a ranch or something
 but youve only been fired once in five
or six years said doris
   anyway lets go and eat we arent
down to peanuts yet for regular fare i
guess he picked up the book and um-
brella  just the volume i w-as wishing
for and you promised to loan it to me too
he observed  why havent you done it
kind lady
   you were too busy for reading i took
it explained doris a touch of ice creep-
ing into her voice
   well i have been busy all right busy
and scared if you want to know it you
see id never been fired before and i
thought it was goin to be something awful
i began to expect it and worry about it as
a change in the management

soon as the new management took us over
now that its actually happened i rather
like it as i say i was getting tired of that
job and i never would have had the nerve
to kick myself out  thank you kindly
sir she said he pressed the printed slip
to his lips and then cast it dramatically
away among the yellow elm leaves he
picked up his hat on the end of the um-
brella
   come on lets eat he coaxed in his
best salesman voice
iv
  they were very jolly over their trays at
the messy cafeteria so jolly that doris
almost forgot she had lost a job that day
and when dinner was over and gene in-
sisted that they take a bus ride she was
so happy that even remembering the lost
job couldnt make her miserable
  uptown along the river they jogged
cozily ensconced in a front seat with most
of the bus top to themselves
   im hoping maybe i can get into a
smaller store where it  be more-more
homy you know said doris
   thats right you did have the idea
that a small stored be nice didnt you
now you see it may be a good thing you
got fired too youll find out what a little
old machine you were getting to be youll
get a chance to develop your many talents
  he pinched her elbow teasingly and
doris agreed that it might be a good thing
she was day-dreaming blissfully sniffing
the scent of withering leaves drinking in
the cool wind from the river
   but you were so awfully different all
week i-i thought you were sore about
something she said at last
   me sore at you lord no i was
just disgusted with myself-and then busy
too and i hated to have you think that
i couldnt make good even as a dinky shoe
clerk lets get down here
   why here
   just for a little walk around rivers
awful pretty up this way dont you think
and i feel as if i wanted something to
drink better have a malted milk youll
be getting skinny the first thing you know
  they got down and walked along a street
lined with cottonwoods there were a few
houses with deep lawns and flowerbeds be-
tween the apartment blocks  wouldnt
it be great to live out here said doris
 in one of those old houses
   yes but mighty expensive theyll
be tearing them down before long and
building up apartments a nice apartment
out here wouldnt be bad though
  they crossed the street walked several
blocks east and went into a store it
wasnt a drug store though it was a
small dry goods store and doris looked
around wonderingly
   its about time you were showing up
somebody growled from behind the coun-
ter and there stood miles his gray hair
shining under the lights
   nice little store he asked doris
   why yes but what are you doing out
here is it-is it yours she gasped
   mine and mr howards there said
miles turning to where gene was fussing
over a shelf of boxes  he cant sell any-
thing but shoes though so well have to
put in a shoe department to keep him busy
we-were hoping youll help us out in the
blouse section well have to have some
just common everyday waists out here
too kind of a neighborhood store you
see but its a nice little business i used
to work in a store like this when i was a
youngster we can build up a good trade
im sure a lot of people rather come here
than trail downtown if we give em what
they want and we can do that rents are
a lot cheaper out here they want good
service though make it a nice refined
little concern like a specialty shop only
more stuff make it neat and attractive
sell the best and sell it right
  miles was elated with the new pride of
ownership
   oh mis-ter mi-iles i simply cant
believe it youre partners-and you want
me doris looked around at the neat
counters the big front windows the grass
rugs and wicker settees there was a huge
bowl of goldenrod on a stand in front of
a mirror
   delighted to have you and im sure
mr howard wont object eh howard

a word for the groom
everywhere we hear her praises
and the beauties that abide
                            in that marvel of perfection
                            the sweet june bride
                             but i rise to ask a question
                              is it folly to presume
                             if we just in passing mention
                              the sad old groom
                            hes the man in somber clothing
like a culprit at the bar
                           but he serves a useful purpose-
                              he hires the car
                           in the ceremony proper
                            his is but a minor pari
                              hes a sort of needful pillar
                              she a work of art
all the papers laud her beauty
                             columns telling of her gown
and her rare attainments noting
when she married brown
but i wish to say in passing
it is neither right nor fair
                           for there wouldnt be a wedding

if your rheumatism comes on again this near
how can a medicine that is applied on the outside of the skin
reach a pain deep down in the joints and muscles this
treatment acts by stimulating the brain to send new blood to
the affected area   
dont suffer unnecessary pain get reliei
at once it may be splendidly courageous
to just grin and bear it-but it is a frightful
waste of the very vital resources you need to
help you get rid of the cause of the pain
  your doctor will toil you that pain should
always be relieved-just as quickly and as com-
pletely as possible
  and this relief is easily at hand however
deep-seated however hard to reach the pain
may seem to you it can be stopped-quickly
and permanently
  nearly fifty years ago a remedy for muscular
pain was given to the world that has brought
relief to so many sufterers that today you will
find it in one home out of every three
  this remedy is sloans liniment-probably
the foremost household remedy in america
used all over lie world and recommended by
doctors everywhere
  no matter where the pain is no matter how
deep down in joints and muscles it can be
reached if the natural curative powers inside the
body are only aroused
  when you use sloans it stimulates the
nerves on the skin they arouse the brain
which in turn causes the blood vessels to ex-
pand throughout the painful area under the
place where the liniment has been applied rich
new blood rushes in
  this new blood coming freshly purified from
heart and lungs with all its marvelous germ-
destroying upbuilding powers brings to sick
pain-ridden tissues just what they need to
heal them
  this is t in scientifically correct way to re-
lieve pain it doesnt just deaden the nerves it
gives your own natural bodily defenses the aid
they need to drive out the cause of pain
  dont wait until you are in actual need get
a bottle of sloans this very day and have it on
hand-c at all druggists just apply it-no
rubbing is necessary it will not stain immedi-
ately you will feel a gentle warmth-then a
pleasant tingling of the skin-then almost
magically relief from pain there is no burn-
ing no blistering only quick lasting relief
sloans liniment - kills pain
