wonders of the machine age

by hugo gernsback

t is a curious failing of the
human race that it has never
been able to look to the future
and to apply the lessons of
 past history to its own benefit
yet we all know that the
future is made by the past and the trite
saying history repeats itself is a proved
fact

  at the present time when humanity finds
itself in the throes of a world-wide depres-
sion everybody is looking for light on the
subject and people ask
themselves what is the
cause of the depression
and particularly of un-
employment

  of late a certain
school of thought has
cried persistently that
all our present trou-
bles particularly un-
employment are direct-
ly traceable to our
machine civilization

this attitude has been
taken up by many econ-
omists and indeed
many so-called indus-
trialists and many
books have been writ-
ten on the subject by
reading this abundant
literature the reader
very often will come to
the conclusion that
there must be some-
thing in their beliefs
and that indeed the
machine monster is
beginning to swallow humanity and pretty
soon we will be all at the mercy of the
machine

  we need not get very excited about the
statements o these authorities because
in the past it has been found that many
authorities were usually wrong in their
outlook on the future only about  years
ago one of our greatest economists made
the statement that by this - time that is
around  there would not be enough
wheat grown to keep the worlds population
from starving everybody can see the fool-

ishness of that statement because we have
today more wheat than we have ever had

  twenty years ago an internationally-
known scientist predicted that by  the
available petroleum would be exhausted
yet in  we find the price of petroleum
falling because we have too much of it

  when the automobile first came along
experts all over the world told us that it
was the death-knell of the horse yet in
the united states in  more farm horses
were living and in service than there were
before the advent of
the automobile in 
- in
 - 
since then horses have
declined somewhat but
the automobile will
never make the horse
extinct

  then it was confi-
dently predicted also
that the automobile
was putting the rail-
ways out of business
and there are even to-
day many authorities
who still believe these
fairy tales when as a
matter of fact the rail-
ways are continually
gaining ground and
are now using the au-

convinced from his studies that everything
worthwhile had been invented and that
there was no future for him in the patent

carol dunfrey was the richest
bachelor in the world but no one
would have suspected it by looking at him
he accepted his wealth just as he did the
sunshine and his glorious health and thanked
all those who refrained from reminding him
of them neither his stocks and bonds nor
his real estate had been able to secure him
happiness or keep from
his life the sorrow that
come to all from the
death of loved ones

  his father frank
dunfrey had died sud-
denly three months be-
fore from angina pec-
toris his mother sur-
vived his father only a
few weeks and though
the physicians had
diagnosed her case as
myocarditis carol
knew that it was real-
ly caused by grief

  both parents gone
within a month no
relatives left not even
a sister or cousin

frank dunfrey had
left behind him the
dunfrey millions and
only one person to use
them naturally more
than one eligible young
lady anxiously await-
ed the end of the per-
iod of mourning when
mr carol dunfrey
would again return to
new york society

  carol ate dinner this
evening in a decided
depression the but-
ler told the cook that
unless something hap-
pened the master would starve to death
whereupon the cook told the butler that if
that happened they might as well order a
funeral for two because if they could not
make him eat they might as well all die
and be done with it peter pimpkins car-
ols valet eating with his usual hearty ap-

 petite overheard the conversation and de-
 termined to see what could be done about
 it

   he awaited carol in the latters room
 are you changing for the opera to-
 night sir he asked

   you know i have not been to the opera
 for four years

                   may i suggest a
                 brisk walk up the
                 drive

                   i am staying at
                 home tonight pimp-
                 kins

                      do not think that
                    i am bold sir but you
                    should get out more
                    patrick tells me that
                    you would not even let
                    him cut the steak this
                    evening and took only
                    one oyster

                    patrick was cor-
                  rect and it was a small
                  oyster but the food
                  was not wasted pimp-
                  kins the food i am
                  sure was not wasted
                  you are right sir
                  the oysters were de-
                  licious and the steak
                  could not be surpassed
                  but that does not keep
                  you alive sir

                      i think that i am
                    still alive

                      but we are afraid
                    of the future may i
                    suggest a little music
                    with your meals i
                    was reading an article
                    the other day of the
                    effect of music on milk
                    production and it
                    seems the cows do
                    much better on classical music than jazz-

   but i am not a cow

   you have a very fine suit sir which you
 have never worn a quiet blue with a lit-
 tle white stripe it is an excellent dress for
 the morning perhaps a brisk walk tomor-

y we grea pieasure

   in presenting to our
  readers this original and
  intensely interesting story
  from the pens of dr keller
  and our managing editor
  without praising it unduly
  we believe that it strikes
  out into a field of science
  fiction that has been left
  somewhat untouched-and
  that is the vivid portrayal
  of the effect of a monster
  invention on human life

    we all know the feeling
  of the terrific confusion of
  our lives that assails us
  every so often we feel as
  though we were caught in
  a whirlpool of events and
  instead of being the mast-
  ers of our fate we are the
  veriest pawns of unknownt
  uncontrollable destiny

     from this lack of control
   our great unhappiness
   springs but what if we
   could control our destinies
   and avoid the pitfalls of
   errors that plunge us into
   misery and bring us face
   to face every day with
   death and desolation that
   thought this absorbing
   story deals with in a grim
   realistic and convincing
   manner we commend it to
   our readers

twenty dollar bill

alone in the library comfortable in
his reading jacket carol dunfrey slow-
ly opened an envelope for a moment he hes-
itated in removing and inspecting the piece
of paper that it held

  but i guess it is time to be serious he
                              thought fingering the envelope he noted
                              his fathers writing to be open-
                              ed three
                              months af-
                              ter my
                              death

                           it must be
                           a special mes-
                           for me

                       not wish to
                       put in the
                       book of mem-
                       oranda he left
                       garding h i s

                       thing serious
                       odd no name
                       for it

  at times father made me feel that his
most important business in life was some-
thing that nobody knew anything about
yet why should he have been so secretive
and did mother know yes she must have
for at times i felt that both of them had
something terrible weighing on them that
no one else in the world could know

david h keller md

  carol sighing removed the paper from
the envelope and unfolding it carefully
smoothed the creases he looked at the
heading my dear son and then at the
signature yomr loving father frank dun-
frey

  then he settled himself in his chair put
the time

projector



the paper in a good light and began to read
the message it was brief

  my dear son

     as soon as you can after reading
  this letter visit henry booth it is the
  desire of your parents that you devote
  your time and resources to assisting
  this man in every way possible as
  soon as you are ready to see booth
  phone manhattan  and simply tell
   whoever answers that you are carol
  and that you want help the man
  you speak to will advise you after
  seeing booth return to new york and
  ask the president of the dunfrey na-
  tional bank for a letter from me your
  work in this matter will be of the
  greatest service to mankind i will
  not live to see its completion but i
  want you to carry on

           p your loving father

                       frank dunfrey
carol read the letter over three times be-
fore he replaced it in the envelope he in-
dulged in a habit which came from his years
of solitude and talked it over to himself

  now who would have thought that good
old sensible dad would have gone in for
mystery stuff like that he wants me to
see a man by the name of booth and says
that by helping him i can be of the great-
est service to humanity

   to humanity     

  the word had a curious sound to carol
ever a student immersed in art and liter-
ature from his boyhood days he found him-
self at twenty-four almost entirely ignor-
ant of the great bustling world about him

  humanity meant generally the mobs of
people who composed the great cities and
from them and their feverish activity carol
had always shrunk

  now together with the burdens of ad-
ministering his vast estates there had come
this curious enigmatic letter with the strange
words service to humanity

  carol got up and paced the room rest-
lessly he loved his father too much to
ignore the request entirely yet he shrank
from what it might mean to comply with
it he had planned to turn the care of his
interests over to bowden president of the

dunfrey national and then to travel for
two years into odd corners of the earth-
perhaps with joan-

  now this thing had intruded itself-but
his fathers wish impulsively he reached
for a telephone

  manhattan  please

  after a moment came a cool polite mas-
culine voice yes carol bit his lip
this is carol and i want help

a mysterious message

there was a trace of suppressed excite-
ment in the voice of the stranger when
ho said yes  mr carol    when
can i meet you

  why asked carol surprised i dont
uiderstand it at all

the mans voice was now cool and in-
exorable i believe you want help
yes of course carol protested he
saw that he must blindly follow this thing
out i will meet you any time you say
very good came the voice in a half
hour in front of the lion at the northern
part of the steps of the public library on
fifth avenue i will carry a malacca cane
and my name is green please come alone
before carol had an opportunity to pro-
test there came the warning click of a re-
ceiver dropped and the buzzing of the
phone

  carol rang for his chauffeur the racer
tom i will drive it

  five minutes later he was speeding down
the drive

  as he crossed seventy-second street to
enter central park he found himself sud-
denly caught in a maze of traffic blocked
by hundreds of people trooping into the
park by all entrances it was fully five
minutes before the line of cars moved on

  as carol passed the traffic officer the
latters reddish face lit up with pleasure
and good even to you mr dunfrey
theyre all crazy be gorry he nodded
enigmatically toward the thousands who
now seemed to be storming through the
park but carol had whizzed by and was
soon deep in the tunnel that connected the
west side of the city with fifth avenue


wonder stories

  it was precisely thirty-five minutes after
he had dropped the receiver in his room
when he stopped his car in front of the
library on fifth avenue in the shade of
the lion who guarded with his stone
bulk the eastern entrance to the building
he saw a young man leaning idly against
the wall swinging a cane

  carol approached the figure

  mr green

  the man who had appeared not to notice
the approach looked up suddenly yes
he answered in his insinuating cool way
dunfrey flushed im carol

  green nodded and then pointed his cane
toward the car can we take a spin
yes of course carol led the way to
the car and at the wheel looked question-
ingly at his companion

  any place in particular

  lets say up the avenue i wont take
long

  there was a moment of silence as the
car moved smoothly through the almost
deserted street it was with a shock that
carol realized how empty the street was he
remembered suddenly the crowds at the
park

  is there a celebration of some sort he
asked green to begin the conversation

  green tapped his feet with his cane
hardly he answered shortly but went
on mr dunfrey if you want to see
booth please follow these instructions
dunfrey interrupted but i dont un-
derstand all this-who is booth

  i dont know answered green frank-
ly all that i can do is to tell you how
to get to him

  pardon me carol stated i was
simply curious

  now then for the details green went
on briskly can you fly a plane

  i practically grew up in one carol
smiled

  then you leave new york when you are
ready and fly to washington from wash-
ington take the st louis air route two
hundred and ten miles west of washington
turn due south for seventy-three miles you
will find yourself then above the heart of
the blue ridge of west virginia at that

point you will connect your televisor for
broadcasting and you will receive further
instructions

  if you are followed by another plane
keep on going circling about until there
ia no longer a plane in sight it is under-
stood that you are to reveal nothing of this
to anyone

  very well carol sighed though it
scunds like a phillips oppenheim novel
green smiled perhaps but we must
put nothing of this on paper i suppose
you can remember it when you are ready
t leave telephone me at manhattan 
if i do not answer you will be told where
i can be found

so that is all you want to tell me
green nodded i will get off here
carol drew up to a curb took greens
proffered hand and watched the young man
walk jauntily across a side street

chapter ii
the pictures on the cloud

carol drew a deep breath the ad-
venture whatever it was whatever it
contained of dime-novel mystery and thrills
had begun out of his cloistered students
life he had suddenly been precipitated into
some intrigue whose nature he could not
possibly fathom

  as he continued slowly up the avenue he
turned over in his mind in amazement what
it could be that caused his father to be link-
ed up with what seemed like a cheap adven-
ture and his mother  suddenly he re-
membered one day when he had been walk-
ing in the garden with her it was a week
after his graduation from yale and he
seemed very close to her she had taken
his arm and said earnestly carol if you
ever have the chance i want you to be very
good to henry bqoth and help him

  before he could remonstrate she had
changed the subject as though she had al-
ready said too much and had never spoken
of it again what could it all mean

  carol had reached the park and turned
into the driveway moving along slowly
taken from his reverie he noticed suddenly
the time

projector



the throngs of people walking quickly to-
ward the center of the park talking eagerly
and looking skyward carol paid them lit-
tle attention until at a crossing his car was
halted by the never-ending throngs that
streamed across the road he followed their
skyward glance and saw at last that all eyes
were directed at a wrhite puff of cloud that
floated slowly over the park-a cloud mar-
ring an apparently cloudless sky

  has it begun he heard someone ask

  its all over another answered

  i hope not said a third i came all
the way from jersey to see it

  finding his passage through the crowds
blocked carol at last turned back and
parked his car at the roadside then ab-
sorbed by curiosity he allowed himself to
be pushed along afoot by the hurrying
throngs

  the main movement seemed directed in
a line with the motion of the curious cloud
carol though no student of science could
not help be stirred to wonder by this
flawless puff of white some three hundred
feet long that slowly floated through the
night sky barely above the tops of the
trees it seemed to move with an anima-
tion and purposefulness all its own

  carol looked about at the faces of the
people in the madly moving flood all
faces seemed eager excited breathless
fearful a though they were about to ex-
perience a thrilling yet terrifying sight

  carol could not help but capture this
queer emotion he touched the arm of
one man

  what is it all about

  the man eyed him curiously and then
pulled away in haste the pitchers he
shouted and then he had gone ahead and
was lost in the crowd

  carol was now thoroughly tired of it all
and tried to elbow his way out of the
throng but his movements excited anger
in thus disturbing the onrushing flood he
finally gave dt up and allowed himself to
be pushed along

  from other pathways streaming across
the green from the automobile roads other
streams moved on an irresistible move-
ment of thousands toward some unknown

goal from ahead the chatter of thousands
was now becoming louder and occasionally
there would come a loud strident voice and
then a cheer there seemed to be a huge
gathering further on and toward that gath-
ering his own stream was evidently direct-
ed

  radical agitation flashed through
carols mind and at once he visualized
bearded men loudly berating muttering
thousands to revolt against their masters he
saw the charge of the police and blood and
broken heads everywhere carol felt in-
wardly sick and once more attempted to el-
bow his wray from the crowds but now
his own stream had been joined by others
until they presented an unbroken front
across the park as far as he could see

  the voices ahead were becoming louder
and louder the cheering and calling more
insistent until finally on turning across
a path carol at last perceived an immense
open green into which were packed tens of
thousands of people all eyes were di-
rected upward where just beyond them
now floating motionless was the strange
cloud

  as carol watched now in fascination
a change seemed to be taking place in the
cloud a faint glow was suffusing it as
though a strong unseen light had been di-
rected upon and through it at once the
noises from the crowd ceased ten thou-
sand voices wrere instantly hushed and a
profound silence that stirred carol to the
depths reigned over the vast field

  the glow of the cloud seemed to become
more and more intense and parts of the
surface were blurred as though a dirty
smudge has been rubbed over it but the
blur was dissolving into separate parts un-
til finally to carols amazement a picture
took shape on the face of the cloud it
showed the calm bosom of the ocean and
upon its surface streaming toward them
was a great steamer its pace was evi-
dently furious it seemed literally to eat up
the watery spaces as it came closer its
six funnels puffing smoke one member of
the crowd shouted why its the new
pride of california biggest thing afloat
finally from the center of the ship there


bonder stories

came a soundless burst of white smoke a
great pillar of flame the ship rocked
slightly and then like a wounded dog
turned slowly on its side to settle deep into
the water the whole event had taken but
a few minutes until the great liner with
one end suddenly upturned disappeared
beneath the waves

  for a moment the crowd seemed stunned
then like the uneasy coming of the tornado
there was loud laughing and yelling swear-
ing and shouting from all parts of the
dense throng the uneasy passions of those
who had just witnessed a terrible catastro-
phe were raised against some unknown
malignant force that had overtaken the
steamer

the picture had disappeared from the
cloud and only the glow of the in-
tense light from some invisible source re-
mained

  for a time the uproar of the crowd con-
tinued and the tension of the past mo-
ments gave way to sudden desire for move-
ments of groups through the crowd carol
was pushed this way and that until finally
he found himself thrown against a woman
in front of him

  beg pardon he muttered as the wo-
man turned angrily but then his face lit
with pleasure

  joan you here

  why carol of all men the young
woman took his arm

  oh wasnt it horrible she nodded to-
ward the cloud her face was sad and ser-
ious yet intelligent and forceful

  but i dont understand carol said con-
fused what was it

  joan allowed her usually serious expres-
sion to relax into a playful smile

  oh i might have known you are ignor-
ant of what goes on in your world havent
you read about the prophetic pictures

  prophetic but come cant we get out
of this

  joan pulled at his arm no wait a few
minutes theres one more showing to-
night that is if they keep to the same
schedule

  but who are they carol asked is

the whole world mad but before joan
could answer his question the crowd had
suddenly grown silent for the cloud was
again blurred and a picture gradually form-
ing

  it was a city street in an exclusive resi-
dential neighborhood from a large im-
posing house a portly man emerged quickly
as he walked toward the curb he suddenly
clasped a hand to his heart swayed and
fell heavily to the street

  walter billings the shout went up on
every side

  is he dead one cried

  no but he will be another shouted
laughing

  there were again loud confused shouts
a virtual din so great that joan clapped her
hands to her ears the crowd were now
moving quickly to the park exits again an
irresistible but purposeless movement and
in its tide carol and joan were caught
as they were hurried along carol had bare-
ly a chance to see the cloud moving swiftly
through the sky receding in the distance
until it was lost to sight

  again on the street and able to move at
will carol led joan to his parked car
where they seated themselves breathlessly

  whew joan exclaimed the power
of the people is felt at last she slumped
back exhausted take me home please

  maneuvering through the streams of peo-
ple carol at last reached the upper part of
the avenue turned west to the drive and
sped along its upper reaches toward the
home of joan at hastings-on-the-hudson

        chapter iii
     - how it happened

soon the city was left behind as the
car sped through the little villages
dotted by great spacious estates that lined
the river joan was silent immersed in
thought and carol with questions bursting
for expression did not intrude

  it was good enough to have joan here
with him and to play the role of protector
to her against the unruly mobs they had
escaped from
the time projector



    one sentence escaped her as they climbed
  the long hill leading into hastings

    so walter billings

    if this were not the cool sane joan be-
  side him carol would have believed that
  the whole of the events of the evening from
  the enigmatic letter of his father to the
  mysterious green the cloud pictures and the
  devastating mobs were the outbursts of a
  world gone suddenly mad

    as he drove carefully through the road-
  way in the blake estate joan suddenly
  awakened youll come in for awhile
  carol nodded and when they had reach-
  ed the doorway he helped her out and fol-
  lowed her into the house

     noticing a light in the great living room
  joan entered carol following

    at the further end near the opened win-
  dow william blake joans father sat read-
  ing he looked up as they entered

    see whom ive found dad

    blake was a noted attorney a member
  carol knew of the dunfrey group of inter-
  ests it had been through his fathers bus-
  iness connections with blake that he had
  met joan he had not seen blake since
  his mothers funeral

    how are you carol blake asked
  sympathetically he was a big ruddy man
  with joans grave penetrating eyes

    very well carol shook the offered
  hand

    they all sat down and tea was brought
  well what did you see blake address-
  ed his daughter

    joans face clouded the new pride of
  california blew up daddy and walter bill-
  ings died suddenly on the street

    blake rose suddenly what it cant be
  true why these things are horrible
  but true joan reminded gently she
  turned to carol but i see you dont un-
  derstand

    carol shook his head hopelessly

    joan settled in her chair two weeks
  ago she began people were amused to
  find one morning all over the city notices
  of so-called cloud pictures to be shown
  t above the mall of central park that night
  the notices were in the form of posters on

walls pamphlets left on doorsteps little
sheets handed out by boys who didnt know
who hired them  notices in the news-
papers

  inserted by unknown scoundrels blake
put in bluntly

  joan gave her father a reproving look
you must have been out of the city then
she continued to carol but thecity took
it as a joke especially when the notices
stated that these cloud pictures were pre-
view showings as it were of events to take
place the next day there followed a few
words about the time and place and then
the cryptic last sentence you shall know
the truth and the truth shall make you
free

  humbug blake grunted

  naturally there was a large crowd at
the park that evening laughing gayly pre-
pared for an entertainment of some strange
novel kind behind it was evidently some
publicity hoax as newspapers believed or
some new stock swindle but the pictures
on the cloud by some means that no one
has yet discovered showed a heavy rainfall
in northern michigan and the washout of a
railroad track a flyer from chicago was
derailed and many passengers killed 

  naturally the scene of this tragedy
sobered the audience and puzzled them con-
siderably for this was not the entertainment
they expected there was a lot of mutter-
ing about why these scenes were permitted
to be shown but carol believe me i was
there that evening and it was all so uncan-
ny and frightening with that ghostly white
cloud moving so purposefully across the
park and then hanging above the mall with
the pictures flickering across it and the si-
lent frightened crowds i came almost to
believe in witchcraft     

  or some new scientific humbuggery
blake said angrily

  i think youre right carol interrupted

  joan shot an angry look at him just
wait and hear this she retorted the
picture had disappeared from the cloud and
then came another one of senator buffing
you know that great pompous gentleman
who orates so magnificently about nothing


wonder stories

every so often-that gentleman known for
his bigotry and intolerance the picture
showed the senator being driven along a
virginia road his car became stuck in the
mud and he got out indignantly apparent-
ly to see why mere mud should retard a
great statesmans progress but just as he
reached the rear wheel to remonstrate with
the lowly mud his chauffeur started the
car and the great statesman was covered
with the mud from head to foot

  everyone in the audience laughed at
this and when the picture finally disap-
peared and the cloud moved away the peo-
ple went home feeling that they had not
been cheated after all  

  but imagine everyones surprise when
both events were duly recorded in the news-
papers two days later the cloud pictures
had predicted what would happen the day
after they were shown

blake had lost his satire he shook
his head a terrible power if it
exists     

  but daddy joan protested we know
that it does exist  weve at least i
have seen pictures every other evening for
two weeks now  even the newspapers ad-
mit that someone has the uncanny power
to predict what is to happen the next day
blake wiped his face with his handker-
chief  a terrible power  its
    its unbelievable     

  but let me go on     joan said
every other night these pictures have been
shown to greater and greater crowds who
have been dropping their doubts and are be-
ing filled with the awe of this powerful
force as you saw carol tens of thou-
sands go there to see and believe

  carol shook his head  i cant be-
lieve it   there must be a trick   

  blake got up and paced about the floor
frankly i wish i could honestly feel that
way carol but i think joan is right
the power of the thing is only too evident
the events that have been shown are too
much a matter of natural forces and are too
widely separated to be the result of any
trickery  i shudder to think of it but
i must admit that in the hands of some man

or men there exists the most terrible power
that a human being ever wielded

  carol nodded terrible yes  isnt
anything known of what is behind it
blake shook his head nothing at pre-
sent the government as usual pretends
that it knows nothing about it   and
that no such power exists the newspapers
treat it as a two weeks sensation warning
their readers slyly that tomorrow surely the
hoax behind it will be exposed  but
the business leaders are becoming worried
theres been a noticeable change in the pub-
lic morale  people are becoming ex-
cited hysterical undependable    theres
a crack in our social organization that i
cant help but attribute to this thing    
he stopped a moment to stare from the
window down to the silent gleam of the
hudson a half mile away then he turned
suddenly

  i cant help but feel that this thing is
destined to be more terrible than any one
admits  i can feel the working of a
powerful intelligence behind it   not
precisely a malevolent intelligence but one
that knows its power and is using it with a
cunning shrewdness what its aim is i
cannot pretend to guess  but if i have
the chance      blakes powerful face
tightened and he clenched his fist    
ill smash this thing    

  with a promise to accompany joan to the
next showing of the pictures carol left hast-
ily and drove about the deserted roads aim-
lessly it was only when dawn was break-
ing that he finally reached his home and
dropped into his bed to an uneasy dream-
troubled sleep

	 

  it was three in the afternoon when carol
was awakened by an insistent knocking on
the door his butler entered to carols
sleepy come in

  mr blake has been trying to get you
on the telephone since twelve the man
explained he insists on speaking to you
now

  connect the extension here carol or-
dered

  in a moment he heard blakes voice
trembling with excitement
the time projector



  i didnt want to disturb you blakes
voice explained but i want you to at-
tend a board meeting of the american fin-
ance company day after tomorrow you
know its one of your directorates

  i cant do it mr blake carol remon-
strated you know i dont intend to take
an active part in the business

  yes yes blake said impatiently but
now you must his voice was earnest per-
suasive ive been a friend of the family
for a long time carol and i urge you to do
this

  but what has happened carol said an-
noyed

  the pride of california blew up you
know and now walter billings has been
found dead on the street   

  carol sat bolt upright in bed the memory
of the last evening suddenly returning

  you mean  the cloud pictures
precisely blake stated the news of
the occurrence of both has come out and
the stock market is in a panic the pride
of california belonged to one of our affi-
liated companies and billings was one of
our directors it looks as though someone is
hitting directly at us now carol i want
you to add your presence to our meeting
and help to stabilize public opinion 
your name carries great weight  and
there are thousands of small investors whose
funds are tied up in these enterprises 
we mustnt fail them    

  very well carol said wearily when
am i needed

  at ten day after tomorrow  the
finance company board room 

  ill be there carol stated and hung up

a serious step

it was a very serious young man who sat
at the directors table the appointed
morning and looked around at his fellow
directors it was his first meeting and
though he knew the directors socially he
had never witnessed their more serious acti-
vities

  his thoughts and feelings were a confus-
ion he had accompanied joan last night
to witness again the cloud pictures and had

seen the devastation by fire of the german
city of essen and the picture of a well
known society woman sitting wrapped in
blankets in her elegant boudoir sneezing
ungracefully into a damp handkerchief
while her guests including the prince of
wales danced below in her far-famed ball-
room

  both grim tragedy and bitter vulgar satire
were blended in this showing first frighten-
ing the vast multitudes who came there to
see and then releasing their tension by gales
of hoarse laughter before they were sent to
their homes

  carols indignation against the forces be-
hind the pictures had widened a gulf be-
tween joan and himself for joans awe of
the pictures was so great as to permit of no
other emotion

  now he sat next to her father as the
chairman of the board rose to open the
meeting carol felt helplessly alone in a
world that suddenly seemed gripped by a
strange form of hysteria

  in the last day even the cryptic message
of his father had been thrown into the back-
ground by these new and more disturbing
events

  gentlemen the chairman explained
certain things have happened which are of
vital interest to this company you all
know about the pictures which have been
appearing in central park whatever their
nature which we are not interested in their
effect has been marked not only on our en-
terprises but also on the general public

  we control through our stock owner-
ship of various companies throughout the
world over twenty billion dollars worth of
property and whatever affects the business
of the world affects us and our investments

  you all know of the pride of california
that ship was the finest of the fleet of one
of our companies so impressed was the
steamship company with the threat of dan-
ger shown in the pictures that an order was
sent to have the ship return to japan which
it had left for san francisco

  the order was obeyed but five hundred
miles from the coast the boilers exploded
and the ship went down with a loss of half


wonder stories

its passengers you know the effect of this
on our stock

  you know of the showing of the death
of walter billings one of our most capable
officers gentlemen we are confronted by a
serious situation caused by this unknown
force i believe that a vast organization of
radical agitators are deliberately causing
these tragedies in the hope of undermining
our whole social order i have called this
meeting to find ways and means of combat-
ting them

  a very old and bewhiskered gentleman
arose

  gentlemen he said our chairman is
right i want to go on record as proposing
a thing that we have discussed before name-
ly that our international lobby have bills in-
troduced into the various national congress-
es making radical agitation that aims at the
destruction of lives and property a capital
offense

  there were confused murmurs about the
table oh thats going too far said one

  but others vigorously applauded the old
man who sat down

  carol glanced at blake who was gazing
questioningly at his fellow directors

  the chairman rapped for order gentle-
men a motion to that effect will be enter-
tained by the chair it being understood
he added significantly that no mention is
to be made of this in the minutes

  when the motion had been made carol
leaned toward blake is this why i am
here

  blake gripped his arm wait he whis-
pered

  then he rose

  gentlemen he said slowly you are
making a great mistake and because you re-
fuse to recognize what is before your eyes
i cant believe that any man of intelligence
and honesty of mind can affirm that radical
agitation is behind these cloud pictures

  a current of protest swept about the
table but blake put up his hand

  i havent finished he stated evenly
this board is doing what is done all too
often you find yourselves helpless and
impotent against a new and terrible force
and you are seeking for something to vent

your fury against i have studied these
cloud pictures he said soberly and i have
been deeply impressed by them

  i agree that they constitute a menace
and i can state from opinions i have obtained
from the most eminent scientists of the day
whom i have consulted that the mere show-
ing of the pictures aside from the prophe-
cies if prophecies they be is the sign of a
scienitfic power unknown to the race

there were exclamations of surprise
yes gentlemen blake went on
suavely while you have fumed and
sought an expression for your rage i have
investigated think men think if rad-
ical agitators possessed such power as you
attribute to them need they stoop to such
petty guerrilla warfare to gain their ends
dont you see that by the very scientific
ability that they possess they could openly
challenge our whole order if they wished
does the immensity of this thing strike you
as being the revenge of a group of murder-
ous socialists or communists

  the bewhiskered gentleman rose angrily
mr blake we are getting nowhere you
havent proved that radicals are not back of
this the radicals who have been trying
desperately for the past five years to de-
stroy our order

  his words were greeted by applause and
shouts the question the
question    

  blake raised his hands helplessly i
see you are determined to ruin yourselves
i ask you not to do this thing i agree with
you that these pictures are a danger to not
only us but our whole civilization but i ask
you to approach it intelligently i ask you
to appropriate one million dollars to a fund
to discover who and what is behind these
pictures     

  the vote that followed was overwhelm-
ing for the original motion carol had vot-
ed with blake out of loyalty to joan
he remained through the rest of the busi-
ness which included a vote for a statement
of confidence to be issued by the company
and the pledging of funds to support the
companys stocks in wall street
the time projector



  carol and blake walked through the
streets after the meeting had adjourned

  im sorry for all this carol blake said
im afraid these old fossils are determined
to ruin us all

i youre sure carol said that you be-
lieve the pictures to be true prophecies
blake nodded and his face tightened
i can discover no other explanation car-
ol our civilization is going to face a crisis
because of them

  carol looked at blake questioningly
social disintegration if they continue
blake affirmed my boy he added i
believe that our civilization despite its
evils is headed in the right direction and
if given time everything will work out but
this force wants to cripple and destroy it
he raised his voice so that passersby looked
at him closely i believe in our world
carol and i dont want to see it destroyed
i have a mission now to find the source of
this powrer and to smash it i believe it
can be found because it is a natural power
they came to the street where they were
to part why dont you join me in this
blake said as they clasped hands

  carol shook his head its not in my
line mr blake and besides perhaps i
cant appreciate the danger

  blake smiled well never mind but
come to see us soon

  with that blake walked hastily away

        chapter iv
        to meet booth

a great distaste for the city had filled
carol and a longing to get away from
it returning home he gave orders to
pirapkins to pack his bag for a months
cruise on his yacht pimpkins face was
asmile as he nodded to these orders

  im glad sir he said simply

  when he was gone carol leaned back in
his chair suddenly he remembered his
fathers note was he to neglect this ur-
gent request perhaps after all he could
regain his zest for things by going to see
booth and at the same time erasing the
mystery that surrounded the man

  he reached for the telephone and wras
soon speaking to green

  i will leave tomorrow afternoon carol
said briefly	v

   k was the laconic answer

  recalling pimpkins carol notified him of
his intention not to take the yachting voy-
age instead he ordered his flying togs
laid out for the afternoon and an airplane
placed in readiness

  am i to go with you sir asked the
valet

  you are not i am going alone

  very good sir

  so on the afternoon of the first day of
june  carol dunfrey left new york
city in his duplier plane two thousand
feet in the air he entered the new york-
washington air-lane and setting his course
indicator for washington he relaxed back
into the pilots seat

  far beneath him the jersey fields slipped
by and in a short time he could see wind-
ing toward him miles on his right the glis-
tening ribbon of the delaware river though
keenly alive usually to the beauties of na-
ture carol today saw only houses and fields
and water the beauty was gone

  stretching out toward the southern hori-
zon was an unbroken line of planes on the
new york-washington course above him
on the higher speed levels there would come
a sudden ear-splitting hum rising to a high-
er pitch and then receding as a plane shot
by at eight miles a minute below were
the free lanes of slower speed where local
planes could do as their pilots desired

  he was decidedly depressed this morn-
ing he had thought that he know what
depression was when both of his parents
had left him so suddenly it was true that
he was alone except for joan and though
he was sure she could be depended upon
still his uneasiness of soul was too great for
love-making rising above the horizon of
his mental confusion there confronted him
the mystery of henry booth

  he felt instinctively that when he met this
man of mystery he would have to make a
decision of vital importance in his life
there was something that he could not und-


wonder stories

erstand but at the end of the trip he would
know

  what help was it that booth wanted
was it wealth was it power he would
refuse him if he called on the dunfrey for-j
tune to create more wealth there was too
great a centralization of wealth as it was
and still more he resented the wealth being
used as a means to gain greater power
power was also too highly centralized he
thought of the millions of workers the city
hordes ofmen and women hurried restless
driven aimless and unhappy

  he had thought once of giving most of
hio fortune away retaining only enough to
keep him in comfort the rest of his life
but what good would it do the people
who needed the money most would spend
it foolishly giving way to repressed cravings
and the next day would be back at work
or in the bread line they could not be
helped by mere gifts of money

  and they could not use power that is
not wisely he thought of the french revo-
lution and what happened when the peasants
took russia away from the aristocrats he
thought of the riots in london when the
labor party and the liberals had been dead-
locked over the nationalization of coal mines
bill for two weeks he thought of what
new york would be like if the workers
realized their power too suddenly

 no emphatically no he did not
know what kind of help henry booth want-
ed but he would not help him place either
power or wealth in the hands of the ignor-
ant the avaricious or the ambitious

yet he felt that he ought to trust to the
good judgment of his parents his
father had practically commanded him to
help the man and his mother in one of
her most precious moments of confidence
had also asked him to do what he could
would they have taken this position if the
man were worthless or not to be trusted if
his plans were impractical and visionary
absolutely no and that was the other way
of looking at it

  it was barely an hour after he had begun
his journey when he saw the wheel-like out-
lines of washington before him now to

follow instructions he changed over
to the washington-st louis route to go
exactly two hundred and ten miles this
course was new to him and while the mech-
anical pilot could be trusted to keep the
course once it was set he felt that it would
be worth while to do more of observation
and less day dreaming and worrying no
use worrying about imaginary things it
might be something real that he would have
to worry about soon

  he opened the window a little to let the
cool air flow into the cabin like water from
a rapidly flowing mountain stream the
lowlands were sweeping behind him and
far ahead he could perceive the foothills of
the blue ridge gently rolling back to the
horizon little streams crisscrossed the
meadowland below him and here and there
after a patch of wood he would come upon
a crystal lake amid green meadows

  the foothills of west virginia swegfe be-
neath him as he at last turned south upon
the last lap of his mysterious journey
twenty miles passed then fifty and carol
was atremble from a new unknown excite-
ment

  when the indicator registered precisely
seventy-three miles carol switched on the
televisor he saw beneath him stretching
out for miles only the bare rugged hills
of the blue ridge hardly a green thing
not a sign of habitation anywhere

  suddenly he heard a buzzing in his radio
he switched it on there came a low voice

  you will see just ahead of you a bald
mountain top  do you see it

  yes     carol stammered into the
speaker

  circle over it and be prepared to land

  on it carol asked

  no you will see a landing field

  very well carol switched off the radio
and circled what appeared to be a gently
rounded hill of bare rock set into a ravine
of jagged and precipitous cliffs

  a sudden fear swept over him the coun-
try looked forbidding he might land here
but could he ever get away still it had
to be done exactly over the rock he stop-
ped his propeller and started his helicopters
the plane dropped gentlywith beautiful ac-
the time

projector



curacy directly toward the rock then
to carols surprise the rock seemed to open
as though the top had been stripped away
and he found himself dropping into a
vast cave down to a sandy floor amid a
group of flat white houses

  simply one more mystery was carols
last thought as the plane touched the ground
he waited a moment to recover from his ex-
citement and then opened the planes door
as though waiting for him as he left the
plane he met two men one man was old
he walked with a limp and a livid scar dis-
figured his face from right eye to throat
the other was barely more than a boy a
slender tanned youth who stood in the back-
ground

  carol knew without asking that the older
of the two was booth but the man did
not wait for him to speak with a smile he
said

  i suppose you are carol dunfrey

  i am and i suppose you are henry
booth

  yes i have been awaiting your visit
with the keenest interest you must be
tired so suppose you rest a while george
take mr dunfrey to number two

the cavern

it was with justifiable curiosity that carol
looked about him as he followed the
young man the cave was a long cylindri-
cal shaped cup which seemed to be hollow-
ed out of the bare rock the sides rising
smoothly on every side he estimated that
the cavern was about seven hundred yards
long by three hundred yards wide about
half the space was filled with about a dozen
one-story buildings all monotonous in their
whiteness everything was white and the
entire absence of color especially green
gave the entire place a strange austere beauty
that at the same time was desolating in its
lifelessness

  looking upward he saw that the roof was
composed of steel which no doubt had been
so cunningly painted that it resembled rock
there was a movable door and through that
door he had gained entrance even as he
looked this door slowly rolled shut and the
blue sky and sunlight was shut out

  light came from somewhere diffused
evenly about the cavern there was a chill
in the air and carol felt intolerably lonely

  this might be the land of the dead he
thought and perhaps it is part of the
plan to keep me here still this boy called
george seems to be very much alive and
even happy

  are you happy george he asked

  the boy looked at him laughingly as he
replied

  certainly i am why not this is my
home and i have everything i want

  but have you ever been to new york

  why should i want to go to new york

  i do not know george but i do know
that many people are never happy till they
go to new york and when they get there
they are not happy either do you like mr
booth

  i think that he is just about the nicest
man i ever knew at times when i think of
him and god i feel that god must look like
mr booth

  even with that scar

  certainly that just makes him all the
nicer

  but if the outside of the camp repelled
carol the interior did not he followed
george into a room that was not only com-
fortable but tastefully furnished thgre
were pictures copies of the old masters a
radio a baby grand piano and just rows
and rows of books across the hall there
was a hint of a most comfortable bed room
a wide window opened from the living room
to a balcony which gave view of the whole
camp

  george put down the overnight bag

  we have dinner at seven he said but
if you want me before just press that button
mr booth said i was to do all i could to
make you comfortable during your stay
here

   george left the room turning at the door-
way to give carol a shy glance of admira-
tion

   sinking into a chair carol closed his eyes
and tried to think the myster associated
with the name of booth had not been dis-
pelled by meeting the man rather the
mystery was deepened not only by the ac-


wonder stories

tual appearance of the man himself but also
from this place-so strange so aloof from
the world that was just beyond the walls of
rock there rose in carols mind a flood
of new questions which demanded answers

  from the first moment he had seen booth
carol had been impressed by the aura of
isolation that surrounded him he seem-
ed to stand apart from everything around
him in an attitude of absolute self-depen-
dence

  now that he was actually here and had
really met booth the whole adventure
seemed more and more unreal so much
had happened in the last few days that it
appeared to be gradually assuming the di-
mensions and similitudes of a dream carol
wondered when he would awake perhaps
in a few minutes he would wake and find
it all a dream and he was back in hi own
house and was it true yes it was a
dream for there in the doorway stood pet-
er good old solid peter rather white-look-
ing but at the same time very fleshlike

  is that you peter carol asked in a
low voice

  yes sir came a voice real and dis-
tinct

carol stood up stretched walked over
to the window and looked out at the
other buildings then he turned suddenly
what in the devil are you doing here
i came with you in the plane sir you
see i promised your mother that i would
take care of you and i had an idea that it
might be dangerous this trip so i came
along

  you should have stayed at home

  but i promised your mother sir
that is different if you promised her
you had to come now that you are here
you might as well unpack my bag and get
ready to shave me

  what suit will you wear sir

  i have only the one i am wearing

  no sir i brought six suits along with
me i was sure you would want to dress
for dinner

  good peter and now suppose we go
across into the bedroom	

  the bedroom was furnished in green
tapestry on the wall a deep rug ort the floor
coverlet on the bed all in green but it was
not the peaceful color scheme that brought
carol up with a start	

  look at that peter do you see what
i see

  i do sir it  a bed with a curious
carving on the posts see the pretty little
girls trying to escape from the goat men
that mr carol is either the bed your
father once bought or it is the exact dupli-
cate

  the bed my father had was marked i
went loose with a penknife one day and
carved my initials on one side of the tail
board

  there are the initials said peter as he
lifted up the bed spread your father must
have sent it here

  well i guess father knew what he was
doing and he must have thought a great
deal of that man do you know the history
of that bed peter

  i ought to sir that was the bed you
were born in

  you are right now i am going to sleep
in that bed again and i think i will have
a new birth peter

  just what do you mean sir

  i dont know probably just a silly
idea that came to me suddenly

  may i advise an aspirin tablet and a
few moments of relaxation sir

  george returned once to inform carol
that booth begged to be excused from meet-
ing carol at dinner he would however
see him in the morning carols dinner
would be brought here

  carol nodded he needed time to read-
just himself to this strange place

  as he sat smoking after dinner carol
tried ineffectually to compose a letter to
joan but the realization that he must re-
main silent about these new experiences
made his words empty he tore up note af-
ter note and at last dropped wearily into
bed
the time projector



        chapter v
        god or devil

it would be too much to say that carol
slept well that night but at least he
slept dreams tormented this sleep how-
ever and filled him with vague forebodings
when he finally awoke and remembered
them

  this seems to be the same old fight he
mused to himself the hand of some ital-
ian now long dust carved his idea of life
 these bed posts it is the conflict be-
tween two antagonistic forces in the world
the struggle between light and darkness
good and bad the left side and the right
the sky and the mud and god and the
devil

  here are pretty little girls who were
just tending to their own affairs and happily
singing on the green grass and along
comes a spider and sits down beside her
and frightens miss muffet away no that
is not mythology the right way is to see
those goat men half men and half animal
slowly creeping through the grass and sud-
denly pouncing on the little dears giving
them the fright of their lives

  peter i was looking at those carved
men and women on the bed ever examine
them closely peter you notice the wo-
men are running away from the men what
would happen if the men ever caught them
that is what i want to know

  i believe the women would like it sir
  but they are running

  women always run sir i feel that it
is a part of their nature but they do not
intend to run all the time they realize
that it is predestined for man to catch them
sir that is what the housekeeper said to
me how can i escape from you when you
are so bold and when it is predestined
god or the devil thought carol as he
dressed which is this man henry booth
how perfectly silly for me to ask a ques-
tion like that when i know nothing about
him his face is perfectly horrible but his
eyes are kindly and once i thought that he
was able to smile yet it seems to me that
if his motives were innocent there would be

no need of all this secretive conduct and
this hidden cave yet he may be working
on some secret which he wishes to hide till
it perfection

  and then there is my mother i think
she must have been one of the best women
in the world if joan develops into a wo-
man like her i will be happy mother
would not have asked me to help booth if
his ideas were in the least wrong but per-
haps she did not know but father must
have known

  an hour later george appeared to lead
them to another building in which there was
a large room set for a meal there were
seats for about fifty around a long table
booth was waiting near the door his
greeting was friendly

  i hope that you slept well my dear sir
in new surroundings a man is sometimes
restless i arranged satisfactory quarters
for your man i was not expecting him
but you were not either and george tells
me he is much attached to you and there-
fore discreet come with me and let me
introduce you to my staff we are very
democratic here

  gentlemen i want you to meet mr carol
dunfrey and his friend mr peter pimp-
kins

  suppose we all begin breakfast our
community is small and therefore we are
all hard workers george you help enter-
tain peter i am sure he will like your line
of chatter

  carol began to eat but iound time to
glance around the table at the men booth
had introduced though he could not de-
fine it he found something about them that
unmistakably set them apart from the rest
of the world perhaps it was his vision of
them living here together shut away from
the world outside and its turmoils per-
haps they had grown alike from association
and similarity of work and habits

  then he noticed their faces were all tan-
ned to such a smooth brown that a marked
similarity was noticeable the tan had an
artificial look caused carol realized by
administering of ultra-violet rays if these
men were shut away from the sunlight con-


wonder stories

tinually some substitute for the sun would
be necessary

  they ate slowly as though time had no
value to them they ate carefully as though
they had cultivated the habit of weighing
every action they ate quietly like gentle-
men but there was little conversation and
no laughter

booth semed akin to these men though
with him there was a greater air of
mystery and detachment carol found that
beyond the usual polite questions and an-
swers nothing could be hoped for in the way
of information at that meal

  booth was certainly disfigured the livid
scar covering a third of the face gave a hor-
rible twist to his mouth whenever he talked
carol thought of the laughing man so
well described by hugo but in this case
there was no laughter rather a deep path-
etic look which seemed to denote pity but
for whom

  it was the mans eyes however that were
his greatest assets deep fathomless black
eyes that seemed to fascinate without mean-
ing too attract without effort govern un-
consciously all they gazed on they told
of the mans power

  one by one the men left the table george
took peter with him at last only carol
and booth were left

  there are a lot of things i want to say
to you my dear boy began the man of
mystery but first i want to tell you how
sorry i was to hear of the death of your
parents your father and mother meant
everything to me they were my dearest
and closest friends circumstances made
i unwise to see you up to this time but
it has been my daily hope that it will be
possible for us to become as close friends
ar your father and i were

  no doubt you are quite puzzled at this
retreat of mine and your presence here
but i will explain everything

  i am engaged in a project on which i
solicit your help fortunately i have al-
ready many loyal followers the men you
have seen here but we need more your
father for many years supplied me with
financial aid we were just about ready to

gather in the twisted strands of our work and
complete it when he died

  i cannot do more than ask you to be-
gin where he left off your father was in-
sistent that you be left a free agent but he
felt that when you knew the facts you
would be more than willing to become my
partner

  carol looked the man squarely in the
eye he was surprised that he even tried
tc- but he knew that there was something
to be said and no matter how disagreeable
he was going to say it

  i am only a young man he said and
there was a quiver in his voice which he
could not conceal only a young man
and yet there are certain hard fundamentals
in my life one is honesty and the other
is openness of purpose when i think a
thing i say it surrounding you is an air
of mystery all you touch seems to be filled
with that same secret atmosphere i know
nothing about you that is hardly any-
thing i am going to be perfectly honest
with you and tell you that you cannot have
a cent of the dunfrey millions till you lay
your cards on the table and convince me
that your project is clean and your pro-
gramme aij honorable one

  booth sailed he answered carol quiet-
ly and there was no quiver to his voice

  i would hardly expect the son of my
friend to say anything else your statement
is appreciated and i might say rather ex-
pected i want you to go into this with
your eyes open and with a full appreciation
of all the facts suppose you come with
me to my workshop there we can talk
freely

  they left the building and entered the
one next to it a passage way led into
another building and at last they were in
a large square room that resembled a li-
brary rather than a work shop there were
maps and charts on the tables and on the
walls there were hundreds of books on
shelves that lined two walls

  here in this room carol felt again an
aura of power that seemed to seep from
the walls and frighten him booth motion-
ed carol to a chair which faced a large
inclined panel about three feet from the
the time

projector



floor holding a large number of dials it
resembled some great complex radio in
the middle of the panel was a square occu-
pied by the end of what looked like a gi-
gantic bifocal eyepiece of a microscope
the chair carol occupied and another be-
side it gave comfortable access to the eye
pieces of this apparatus

booth speaks

i	 o it down in one of these chairs car-

  o	ol you do not object to my being
informal enough to call you by your first
name your father and i used to call you
carol and naturally it is hard for me to
think of you or call you by any other
name you sit in one chair and i will sit
in another you want openness and i will
give it to you frankly

  i ought to say a few words he con-
tinued stroking his scar with one hand
i first thought that it would be best to
have you stay here a few days and become
acquainted with us before i revealed my
secret but i can sense your uneasiness and
inner turmoil and that you are eager to
get away

  so i decided to talk to you this morning
about some of our plans and i can best
start the talk in this room perhaps you
wonder why your father asked you to come
here and see me before you made any plans
for your life work for a few minutes
booth was silent looking almost moodily
at the pipe in his clenched fist -then he
went on

  your father was my best friend it was
his own idea that if he should die sudden-
ly i should have you visit me and explain
to you our work you were to have an in-
vitation to participate we were sure that
if you did not approve of it you would at
least keep our secret

  i want to be sure of my fathers posi-
tion said carol doggedly

  it was simply this for years i have
planned a work and your father has financed
it there are not many in our organiza-
tion but he and i were the leaders

  he must have approved of it
  naturally it was his lifes ambition

to live and see it end in success only his
untimely death prevented this

  you are rather young to bear the re-
sponsibility of so great a secret and yet
you must have your fathers blood in you
and i am satisfied from what i know about
you personally that you are going to be a
true son of a great man

  you say you know a great deal about
me personally

  yes

  i despise this constant reference to the
use of a spy system if i thought that one
of my servants-

  now dont allow yourself to think ill of
them carol ill explain everything in
good time

  but i cannot wait

  that is because you are young youth
is always impetuous now before i go on
i wit to ask you one question if you
were given an opportunity to share in a
work which has for the only object the
promotion of the happiness of the human
race-would you join would you join no
matter what the cos was even the subserv-
ience of everything else to that purpose
you use the word happiness

  that and that alone

  not greater power or more wealth for
the few

  never happiness is my only aim
carol looked at the mysterious man
closely the hand opening and closing on
the pipe was a strong hand the eyes were
strong the whole man gave the impression
of immense reserves of power the thought
came to carol for a second only to be in-
stantly dismissed that he was talking to one
who was insane a dangerous monomaniac
booth talked of happiness for the human
race how could that be accomplished by
a handful of men shut up mysteriously in a
cave in the blue ridge

  yet he felt the impact of a powerful per-
sonality was the man trying to bring him
under some kind of psychic control could
he be trusted should he go with him or
should he refuse to come under his influ-
ence

  booth sat motionless had his eyes been
closed it would have seemed as though he


wonder stories

were asleep while abroad carol had seen
in a berlin park the statue of an ancient
germanic ruler-a man with thin intense
features who sat high and aloof yet with
burning eye seemed to dominate the peo-
ple of the city carol remembered that
the women used to cross themselves as they
passed through that square the little chil-
dren would run to escape his shadow the
rich young man suddenly saw that resemb-
lance of booth to this old teuton king
he knew that he had to give an answer
but it had to be an honest one

  i cannot tell you what my reply will
be mr booth i cannot tell you because
i have not the necessary facts on which to
base an opinion you speak in generalities
so far i have not learned a single fact
you are the true son of your father
no doubt but i am of the opinion that
he never went into anything blindfolded

an amazing sight

booth leaned back in his chair very
well you shall sfce i suppose it un-
necessary to ask that you will never betray
what you see and learn here carol nod-
ded then look into that eyepiece it is
not necessary but it will help if you try
to imagine that your entire body is being
sent through that opaque lense now par-
don me a minute

  booth rose to consult a voluminous book
then he walked over to what appeared to be
an automatically recording typewriter car-
ol looked on quietly

  now i want you to imagine you are at a
coal mine in cornwall now keep remem-
bering it is the mouth of the shaft in corn-
wall and you are there keep looking at that
glass

  booth turned a large dial from some-
where it seemed from under the floor
carols chair was resting on there came a
slow ponderous grinding as though some
metal god of the underworld was being
aroused from an age long rest gradually
the sound changed to a thick muffled groan
of increasing vibratory rate during this
period it seemed to carol that he was being
lifted from his seat and carried through

the ground glass eyepiece into unfathom-
able space he developed a slight nausea
with a sense of lateral vertigo a sense of
being tossed into space like a fragment of
cosmic dust he held on to the handles of
the chair pressed his body against the back
but still the feeling remained

  looking sidewise he saw booth turning
one dial after another touching the rubber
knobs with those strong fingers and yet with
a delicacy of contact that seemed almost
feminine in its lightness then to carols
overwrought nerves came a queer thrill as
though a strong current was sweeping him
not only through space but also through
time

  at last booth pressed a button his last
movement everything in the room seemed
to become quiet a hush of lifeless death
fell on the room and a blur appeared on
the eyepiece carol was looking through
the blurred picture gradually cleared and
then sharply outlined distinctly focussed
unspeakably clear came a picture

  it was a strange village there was a
large opening in the ground surrounded by
buildings piles of coal showed the nature of
the mine a machine was hauling some-
thing out of the pit something at the end of
a long rope excited groups of men gather-
ed around and with them were weeping
women and little children playing unable
to realize what was happening

  soon the end of the rope came into view
hauling up from the hole a rough cable
car on it were four men and they carried
a rough stretcher a little man his head was
crushed and bloody lay on the stretcher
there was no doubt that he was dead a
woman carrying a baby rushed up threw
off those who sought to hold her back with
kindly arms and threw herself on the body
of the dead man

  henry booth pressed another button the
scene faded carol rubbed his eyes and
locked at the man seated in the chair a few
fee away from him booth started to ex-
plain

  you have just seen a picture of the death
of john haynes a coal miner in cornwall
he said goodbye to his wife went to work
the time

projector



and was brought up dead of course it
has not happened yet

  not happened yet

  no it will not happen till tomorrow
when we receive the report of the accident
we will check that with our own chart
and see if there is any variation we
constantly do this to determine any flaws
in our machinery

  carol sat with his head in his hands
was he awake or dreaming-dreaming of
thousands of people in the darkness of cen-
tral park looking upward with strained
eager faces at a puff of cloud he jumped
from the chair what have you shown me
he cried huskily

  booth rose and placed a gentle hand on
carols shoulder just a projection of the
future carol-

  great turmoil surged through carol he
felt unable to speak-you-you- he
managed to blurt suddenly he became
cool

  then you are the man who has been
showing the cloud pictures in central
park

  booth nodded

  carol gazed unbelieving at him it
seemed incredible that he was finally face
to face with the man who was responsible
for those pictures

  carol felt that the man simply could not
do what he claimed there had been some
hypnotic power perhaps there was such
a thing as mass group hypnotism the
actual ability to see what was taking place
in the future was a prerogative of divinity
the whole thing was impossible unreal ab-
surd he was dreaming and would soon
awake it was all false untrue a phantasy
all of it the man the silent camp the ex-
hibitions and the odd machine that was
given the credit for causing them-all a
lie the work of a degenerate psychotic man
drunk with power and anxious to ruin the
whole world happiness bah

  but he had to see it through if it were
a dream he would awaken if a reality what
a chance was his to save the world but
once again he heard his mothers voice ask-
ing him to help henry booth

  booth was talking

   what do you think of it carol have
i shown you what i can do simply this
i am able to look into the future and see
the destiny of man i can see the future
of humanity and make that future known to
man and perhaps when he sees the pit-
fclls in his destiny he will take steps to pre-
vent it will you join me in this work

   all my life carol said i have heard
 the doctrine of predestination preached
 from the pulpit i heard it so often that
 in time i came to believe in it the idea
 was that the life of each man was predes-
 tined and that in no way could he change
 it by so much as a millionth of an inch
 or the split second i never felt easy over
 the idea but it explained some things and
 the fact that it was god who arranged the
 programme made matters a little easier to
 accept

   but no one could change the program-
me of the individual man once god had or-
dained it it seemed that even god once
he had written the page of a mans life
could not alter it now your statement is
in variance in two ways that will take a lot
of explanation you replace my god with
your machine and at the same time say that
if man is warned the danger can be averted
explain that and tell me of this peril to
the human race and i may go with you i
may-and  may not

chapter vi

a threat and a prophecy

  o uppose we go to my library

  o	booth said they walked out of
the laboratory into the street and along
the center of the cave now and then they
met one of the workers who stopped to ask
for advice or instruction to all booth
listened respectfully and gave unhurried
and complete answers at last they entered
a house detached from the others

   this is my home announced booth
simply and this is my library i do not
know what the word home means to you
but it means much to me this is the only
home i have ever had i have slept in a
barrel washed dishes in a filthy restau-


wonder stories

rant i have even slept in a chair with
my head on a rope for fifty cents a night i
spent long months in the trenches in 
and long years in a cheap college boarding
house now i am living in luxury thanks
to your father all the great things i have
i my life i owe to him all the comfort
and hope and inspiration i received from
him sit down

  you have their pictures my parents

  certainly why not they were my
best friends are you ready for a lec-
ture

  i hope so i am trying to be impartial
to retain my poise but it is only fair to
say that it is hard for me to do so

  i cannot blame you here is a little
science einstein showed us that everything
is simply the manifestation of the same
force energy time space movement
gravitation electricity life-all simply
various ways of looking at the same force

  space you are familiar with movement
you can understand my hand is on the arm
of this chair and now i move it and it is
five minutes of eleven i raise my hand
and unsupported it falls and that is grav-
itation now i raise my hand i say that
i have raised it and that is an event of the
past i say that i will raise it three seconds
in the future and that is a prophecy i
count one-two-three-and up goes my
hand and the prophecy is fulfilled that is
simple is it not

  now at this precise moment we stand
in the middle of a flood or tidal wave of
time there is time back of us and time
in front of us and we are moving on that
wave the bootblack on the street the
courtesan in her gilded cage and you and
i in this room are on the crest of that time
wave

  suppose that yesterday all day you had
been followed by a man with a moving
picture camera every moment of every
sccond would be recorded then you would
have those pictures thrown on a screen and
you would look at them and say that they
were true and lifelike and actually repre-
sented what happened that is clear so
far

  now tomorrow you are going to do cer-

tain things at certain seconds of the day
determined by the forces that are already
at work in you suppose we take a picture
of your conduct tomorrow and show you
those pictures today you should if you
were honest say that they were just as
truthful as the pictures taken of you yes-
terday that is what we have learned to
do we lay no claims to the influencing of
human conduct we simply state that we are
able to predict and visually show pictures
of future happenings i can tell you just
what you will be doing at this time three
hundred days from today at least i can
show you a picture of yourself at that
time

  reading a newspaper

  yes

  then you can tell who the next presi-
dent of the united states will be
certainly

  then why have the election

  because only i know the secret

  i see the point now how will this
knowledge of the future make the human
being happier

  it will show him the truth and the truth
will set him free from the chains of ignor-
ance greed and a slavery to intolerance
and falsehood

  but perhaps he does not want to be set
free

  he must want to or else humanity will
be destroyed

  you said that before

  i will say it again the time projec-
tor will for the first time show mankind
the consequences of his acts in time for him
t avoid those acts and their consequences
once he adjusts himself to the eternal ever-
lasting unchangeable laws of truth    
wait a minute you talk of science as
though it were god

  perhaps the words are synonomous let
me ask you a question you were too young
to remember the last war but perhaps you
hi-ve read about it seen moving pictures of
it let me tell you this the pictures
told the truth but only part of the truth
i lived through most of that war i have
limped ever since millions of the soldiers
the time projector



came out alive but mentally and physically
bankrupt 

ii	yie know now that war was the direct

  vv result of the selfish thought and ac-
tion of less than a hundred men suppose
the common people had known before the
war just what would happen all through it
what if the mother had seen her mutilated
son the father his blinded boy suppose
the german school boy had seen the trench-
es and his knife in the body of another
schoolboy who had committed no crime
greater than being born a frenchman
suppose the conduct the thoughts of those
hundred politicians had become the proper-
ty of the common people i tell you that
they would have taken those politicians and
sequestered them for life they would
have stoned them to death they would have
done anything to prevent fourteen million
of our best boys tearing each other to death
or mutilations worse than death am i
right

  i think so i heard father talk about
it he went through part of it

  his body was not hurt mine was
but my soul was hurt worse i made up
my mind that there should never be another
war not if i could help it but let me tell
you something carol forces are danger-
ously at work right now the seed is being
sown which will ripen into another war
twenty years from now it will be a war
that will kill a fifth of the worlds popula-
tion and the remainder will die of disease
and famine he was silent for a moment
immersed in thought carol felt stupefied-
unable to move or think he could only
listen

  i am sure that man does not consciously
direct or determine his future the world
is too large there are too many confused
battling forces for any man or any group
of men to control the leaders take advan-
tage of their position and ride on the crest
ot the wave to worship or detestation they
take advantage of the tides of life battling
ceaselessly against the shores of eternity
but if mankind could tell what the future
holds he could control that future change
it

  let me give you a concrete example i
see that a man will tomorrow fall under a
locomotive and be instantly killed i do
not want this man to be killed so i warn
him as a result of this warning he re-
mains at home and is saved

  then you can still save the life of that
coal miner in cornwall

  yes i could

  why not do it

 what would be the use he would
think that it was some kind of a trick and
would refuse to take advice am i right
carol nodded but he said if you
can change the future then it is not really
the predestined future that you see

  you are right said booth what i
see is the future as it is being arranged by
all the forces in existence if i interfere
with that future-warn the coal miner for
example-i must again look into my mach-
ine to see what the new future will be-not
only for the coal miner but for everything
else in the world that the coal miners life
affects if he is saved he may become
prime minister of great britain and so af-
fect the course of world history

  our great mission continued booth
is to educate the masses so they know that
there exists the power to see the future
they must be taught at first through fear
stop thinking that we arrange disasters
we have nothing to do with that we sim-
ply see what is going to occur at a certain
time in a certain place once the world
understands this its fear will change to
trust faith in whatever warnings we give
human conduct will no longer be governed
by temporary greeds passions and lusts
but by a deep sense of truth and the fitness
of things would you like to see some pic-
tures of that future war

  no at least not today i am shaky
enough as it is

  very well carol we will postpone it
but listen to a little more of the lecture
carol felt calmer he had not given his
decision but at least he knew the mystery
the worst of it was over and he was still
sane he had not even become hysterical
there was entering him like a warm stimu-
lating liquid the influence of booths fr-
wonder stories

sonality he felt it flow through him and
as it swept along it removed fear was he
beginning to have faith in the man henry
booth

  man has paid dearly in the past for his
follies said booth but they never
wrecked humanity entirely because man
lacked the ability to do himself enough dam-
age but he has never been in the same
dangerous state of unstable unbalanced
equilibrium that he is at present in times
past he was closer to the elements neces-
sary for the continuance of life the produc-
tion of food shelter and clothing his abil-
ity to destroy depended on his ability to
come into personal contact with his enemy
the result of the interaction of confused
forces battling for control in life was never
powerful enough for any to gain enduring
supremacy napoleon for all his genius
had to continually reconquer europe for
it was physically impossible in his day to
keep an entire continent under the iron heel
of one man but today the iron heel is re-
placed by a scientific hell and the old
confusion of aims that used to animate
nations becomes of greater and more vital
importance

carol decides

he world by the interaction of thou-

  jl sands of forces is being driven tow-
ard a final conflict in which science will des-
troy not men or armies but nations and at
last all humanity the airplane can spread
poisons that will destroy all life animal
and vegetable and turn a state like pennsyl-
vania into a charnel house over night

  cities like new york and london can
be shattered in a few hours by a bombard-
ment controlled by wireless panic will fol-
low attack and death and starvation-hope-
less endings to all that is worthwhile-will
take their place as destroyers of the race of
mankind those who live will have such
shattered nervous systems that they will
crawl into caves and pray to the gods they
know to crush them so they will not have
tn bear the endless suspense of the days the
hopeless terrors of the night

there is a little nation a very small

tiny people one of their number works
day after day in a little laboratory all
alone he will discover a new and deadly
germ the paranium bacillus he will be
driven to scatter this new germ through the
countries that are filled with hatred for his
beloved land when that germ starts to
work the black plague will be a game for
children in comparison it will leap across
from one house to the next and from one
country to another it will cross the ocean
on the wind and the deserts in the carpet
used by the arab who will die as he prays
to his true god the gangster will die in
the jail the minister in his pulpit the little
baby at her mothers breast there will be
no more war because universal death will
serve as the great pacifist

  i felt that something like this would
happen as the years have rolled by i
was sure that there would be another one
but i could not prove it now thanks to
my time projector i am able to i can
not only tell that that devastation is coming
but i can give all the details and this war
will be the price that man pays for his folly
unless he is able to escape i want to warn
him but he has to believe in me

  and you really think that you can es-
tablish that belief

  i must it can only be by continuing a
i have begun i mean to show man his fu-
ture by a thousand proofs by ten thou-
sand actual examples i am going to show
him that the future is known then when
he realizes my power to see it he will be
willing to listen and when he does he can be
saved and the world free from fear will
become a happy place to live in

  but unless you interfere by a warning
the action goes through as shown in the
picture

  absolutely

  and it cannot be avoided

  only if i give a warning-such as that
to the coal miner

  but there would have been no way of
saving him without telling him

  unfortunately no there is one part of
the invention that i have not told you of
we have what might be called a prognosti-
cating time and space board the time
the time projector



board is divided into split seconds it
work in harmony with an indicator on a
world map as the time indicator moves
on in split seconds the indicator moves
suddenly a signal flashes red the auto-
matic recorder makes a record of the time
and the corresponding place a number of
my men every day take those danger time-
place warnings and by the time projector
find out just what the event is i do not
know how it works it is just something
that happened to come to our attention and
we used it

  looks to me like an intelligence worthy
of divinity

  i suppose so to me it looks just like
one more scientific truth which so far we
are unable to explain but here is the way
we can use it suppose that we see that a
great man is to be assassinated at a certain
place at a certain time we can warn him
and his life can be saved

  and if enough people believe the warn-
ings

  then nations can be saved as well as
individuals and we can influence the entire
race of mankind

  i think i understand it now just what
is my part in all this

  you are to take the place of your fath-
er he was a powerful influence in the
world he believed in me and was willing
to work with me toward saving humanity
ii is sad but the world must be first fright-
ened and only then will it accept the
truth of my teaching you must be the
leader the one who will teach the race
and you

  where i have always been my dear
boy and that is in the background i have
never cared for power and i have no use
for wealth i was really in earnest carol
when i said that i was anxious to make the
world a happier one

  there was a long pause finally carol
spoke

  i am going to go through it with you
i think that it will be worth while

  then you really believe in mej
yes i think so but i guess the real mo-
tive back of my decision is a boundless
faith in my mother

the time projector

tvtow may i ask you to show me the
-l  time projector carol asked
certainly but suppose we wait until
after lunch now i must ask you to excuse
me i must go on my tour of inspection of
the camp it gives me my chance to meet
my workers and to clear up doubtful things
for them

  they are all fond of you it seems said
carol as they rose

  i dont know said booth wistfully
they were all workers with me years ago
i got to know them all so well that i knew
before i asked them that they would come
here with me george was the son of one
of my men who was killed years ago he
commended george to my care

  do they know your secret carol ask-
ed

  no at least no one knows all of it
each man even my chief engineer knows
only a part of it they are all loyal but
not curious now i must go we will
meet again after lunch

  they walked into the street carol re-
turning slowly to his own quarters the
impact of booths revelations like a sudden
wound had at first stunned him killing all
sensation now confused thoughts were re-
turning

  he smiled as he thought of his fellow
directors feverishly ferreting out half-
starved agitators while here in this hidden
retreat a calm little man 

  then came the thought of joan and her
awe of the exhibitions and blakes impas-
sioned words  i have only one mis-
gion  to find and crush this thing
reaching his room carol sank into a
chair had he really enlisted himself in
this gigantic plan of booths and alienated
himself from the world that he knew car-
ol tried to shake off his forebodings and to
free himself from booths spell but they
clung through the rest of tlje morning and
through the luncheon sitting next to booth

  when the meal was over booth asked
carol to come with him they went
through a narrow corridor down sleps
carved in the solid rock and finally emerged


wonder stories

upon a balcony it ran along the side of
the wall of a vast vault as large as the
upper cave from the balcony ran bridges
across the room

  the machine lay in the immense cave
beneath them quiet motionless potential
in its strength a sleeping leviathan carol
caught only a confused glimpse of acres of
metal a monstrous metal bulk below them
its size dizzied him it seemed endless in
its extent carol wondered if it was alive
the few men who stood around it watching
the dials looked like insects beside it

  booth pointed downward to a place
where a great panel had been moved back
from the top as thought to expose the heart
of the giant the interior was filled with
countless thousands of pieces of a brown-
ish substance resembling at the distance
great sponges they seemed to slowly vib-
rate expanding and contracting 
like thousands of beating hearts 

  that is the receiving time photograde
explained booth there th impressions
the units the elements of time-space forces
that compose the events of the world are
received it is the mouth which catches
food for the machine a rather crude ex-
pression but easy to understand

  they walked on at another point a vast
door in the machines side was opened here
the body of the monster was filled with an
enormous number of pieces of delicate mech-
anism which interacting on each other made
carol think of the works of a fine gargan-
tuan watch each little wheel each deli-
cate spring moving ceaselessly threw back
the light of the room from a million re-
flecting facets this portion of the mach-
ine was as large as a city block though it
composed only a fraction of the entire mon
ster

  booth explained it

  that is the analysis chamber where the
future time-place-person pictures are sorted
and classified there are other parts to
the machine but it would take days to even
give you a faint idea of the entire machine

  henry showed him these parts the great
chamber bewildering in the complexity of
its mechanism where further analysis and
classification of events went on and their

trends into the future were sorted he
pointed out the middle photograde where
the trends of various forces were re-com-
bined by superimposing them one on anoth-
er as film negatives may be combined to get
a composite picture

  and here henry said finally the pro-
jecting photograde leads into the room
where we saw the projection of the future
and from there i broadcast the pictures
that are received on the cloud

  what i have in my machine is a vast
chemical retort into which are poured all
the forces operating in the world-in nature
and in the hearts and minds of men and
nations to produce what we call the future

        chapter vii
        violent measures

at booths insistence carol stayed on at
the cave day after day passed and
still he could not tear himself away from
the home of the time projector and the in-
fluence of this strange man since he had
told his servants that he would be gone but
a day or two there would probably be con-
siderable uneasiness at the dunfrey home
although the household was geared to run
indefinitely without a master but joan
would surely be exceedingly worried

  carol asked tentatively if he could com-
municate with joan but booth shook his
head i wish i could see how be pat-
ient for a few days more and then go back
to the city carol agreed to this reluct-
antly

  the machine with its awful power now
fascinated carol day by day he remained
with booth for hours as the latter swung
dial after dial consulting his ponderous
books of calculations and formulae so as
to get the settings proper to catch the time
and place of important events

  now for the first time as booth showed
carol pictures of events to occur one five
ten years hence carol saw clearly the ter-
rible folly of man as a flashing burst of
inspiration the pictures laid clear how
man and his nations and his officials and
organizations planted each hour the seeds
for future unhappiness
the time projector



  he saw the blunderings of politicians that
that led years later to financial and social
catastrophes he saw the suppression by
imperialistic groups of backward peoples-
to lead gradually to the revolt of the vic-
tims and the destruction of their masters
he saw the building of homes and cities
and bridges for profit and the destruction
of some of these edifices with the loss of
thousands of lives he saw unwise laws
passed unwise liberties aild restrictions
crimes and punishments-the whole panor-
ama of futile human struggling against its
destiny swept like a divine vision before
him

  but not all was tragic there was com-
edy in some of the scenes-comedy bitter
and hilarious there were scenes of hope
too-the effects of the activities of men and
groups here and there struggling with force
and wisdom for enlightened living

  day after day the bond between the two
men became stronger carol fell complete-
ly under henrys spell and saw now how
the man had been able to hold his workers
in this isolated spot for so long working
on a project whose nature they did not
know

  his own part in henrys program became
clearer as he saw the gradual unfolding of
henrys vast conception of a worlds redemp-
tion while henry was to remain in the
cave projecting year after year the scenes
of the future that were to make men con-
fess that the power of prognostication ex-
isted carol was to go out into the world
and begin to convert men and nations to the
course of conduct dictated by the machine

  for henry said one day we cannot
rule men by fear alone the machine can-
not remain in existence perpetually to act
as his conscience it is after all only a
test of whether man can improve quickly
enough to save himself i give man this
chance now i will show him the truth
and allow him to learn over the course of
years what conduct will bring him happiness
and what will bring him misfortune when
i die i wish the machine to be destroyed
i will not trust it in another mans hands
for it can become too terrible a power if
used selfishly

  your place carol he continued is
to act as the living voice of the machine
the wealth power and prestige of your
name should give you the right to speak to
man in his own behalf

  i will give you the wisdom of the mach-
ine and you will in indirect ways convey
that wisdom to the people you will enter
politics and by your wisdom you will rise
rapidly until you become a great world
force people then will have the chance to
follow the guidance of a man with unlimit-
ed vision if they follow you i hope that
the catastrophe of  years hence will be
averted if not  i can do no more

  if carol had in him any further capacity
for surprise the vision of his own destiny
presented by booth shook him to the depths
to become a world force  for the
betterment of man was he worthy he
put this question to booth

  you are carol booth said apprecia-
tively you have great capacity for lead-
ership and power i will give you the in-
strument to make it effective

  left alone with himself carol wondered
he returned again and again to the great
vault that housed the machine to look upon
its great bulk feel the thrill of its power
thiough him in order to test its reality and
the reality of his existence

  he even went down into the ground to
the vast base on which the giant rested and
ran his hands over its endless smooth metal
sides yes it was all true 

  he tried to question during the last days
before he returned to the city what the fu-
ture of man and the worlds happiness
meant to him previously he had been un-
aware of it only the happiness of three
persons had mattered and two of them
were now gone did he really care whether
the world evolved to some glorious sum-
mit of achievement or contrarily if a gen-
eration in the future it was struck with an
overwhelming disaster

  at the moment he could not think clearly
on the question the personality of henry
and the power of the machine loomed too


wonder stories

vast in his mind he knew that he would
do as henry had planned

  accordingly on the fifteenth of june ac-
companied by peter he entered his plane
and shaking hands with henry watched the
vast roof of the cave move back on its roll-
ers until the dazzling sunlight of a sum-
mer morning flooded in setting the heli-
copters for a vertical lift carol felt the
machine rise swiftly and a thousand feet
in the air turned it toward new york

	 

when carol had telephoned her of his
intention to take an outing for a day
or two joan felt miserably alone her fath-
er had suddenly gone away on a mysterious
journey a day after carols departure and
with her two only intimates gone she felt
utterly deserted

  each night however she attended alone
the showing of the cloud pictures and
now with growing apprehension as the auth-
enticity of the pictures sank deeply into
peoples minds she saw the terrible uneasi-
ness in their faces it seemed as though the
future that thing which was tomorrow had
suddenly left its place of hiding and had
jumped out upon them the future with
its menace and uncertainty lurked around
the corner the presence of death and dis-
aster weighed heavily on everyone each ac-
tion each day became fraught with terrible
significance

  the crowds had become boisterous rough
offensive small riots had occurred one
night the third day of carols disappear-
ance-seemingly the outbreak of passions
otherwise repressed and the mood of the
crowd was so menacing that joan did not
dare return

  she spent two miserable days filling them
with restless hours at the piano until she
felt obliged to jump up and rush to the
windows for air then she read the news-
papers hungrily scanning every inch of the
accounts of the exhibitions noting now the
evasive comments of public officials and
scientists who had been asked for explana-
tions of the phenomena one paper called
lcudly editorially for the closing of the

park temporarily hoping thereby to end
the exhibitions

  on the day of that editorial blake sud-
denly returned home his face worn and tired
with days of endless thought he em-
braced joan tenderly

  daddy im so glad youre back id
have gone mad in a few more days

  blake stroked her hair hasnt carol
been consoling you

  joan began suddenly to sob carols
been away for five days now and not a
word from him im afraid somethings
happened   

  blake laughed nonsense he can take
care of himself have you called his
house

  joan nodded wiping her tears all they
knew was that he had gone in his plane on
the afternoon of the first they havent had
a word

  blake could not hide his concern though
he shrugged his shoulders

  and now you deserted me joan said
accusingly and you look all tired out
i am girlie blake said sinking into a
chair tell me he sat up suddenly
what has happened with the cloud pictures
in the last few days

  joan showed him the papers and the edi-
torial blake read it with growing anger
finally he threw it away the fools he
growled the utter fools

  why daddy

  dont you see joan he leaned towaid
her they hope to cure the disease by
stifling it people have become doped with
the exhibitions we cannot simply deprive
them of them im afraid of what will hap-
pen now     

  blakes prophecy turned out to be true
that night a cordon of police guarded all
entrances to the park and when the tens of
thousands who arrived found themselves
blocked by the ring of bluecoats riots took
place at a dozen sections the morning
showed a toll of ten persons killed and over
three hundred injured

  but it showed a more astounding fact
reading the paper blake and joan learned
that as the crowds had fought bitterly with
the police at the southern entrance to the
the time projector



park on fifty-seventh street the cloud was
seen suddenly floating south over the park
miraculously it had halted-above the park
plaza and after a few moments had come an
exhibition of the prophetic pictures

  the people no less than the police were
stunned but the showing of the pictures
and acute realization of the power of the
unknown exhibitor had set the crowds in a
new frenzy of passion when the police
tried to drive them from the plaza further
bloodshed had occurred a riot call re-
sulted in the spreading of tear gas among
the crowds and their final dispersion

  no one concluded the article no-
ticed in the excitement the disappearance
of the cloud

  blake and joan were silent when they
finished reading finally blake muttered
softly with the utmost of his feeling the
fools  the fools   

  but what is to be done joan asked
finally

  find whoever is responsible for this
blake said savagely and then crush
jiim

  joan shuddered somehow she felt ap-
prehensive for carol  why she could
not tell   

  blake told her no more and during the
days that passed she again lost contact with
her father  while her apprehension
for carol grew ten days had passed and
not a word the dunfrey butler had tele-
phoned joan admitting at last that he was
worried he stated that he had consulted
the dunfrey personal attorney and a pri-
vate search was being made to discover if
carol had not met with an accident they
admitted that this was unlikely for the ac-
cident rate in planes of carols type was
extremely low and carol was an expert
pilot

  to joan blake seemed to have plunged
into some new and absorbing activity men
came almost every hour to the blake home
grave official-looking men men carrying
brief cases bulging with the suggestion of
huge documents  with them blake
was closeted by the hour  to emerge
with them discussing gravely in low tones
mysterious plans

carol returns

during the meals blake was silent and
absorbed but he showed by his man-
ner the effect of a terrific mental strain

  one day he brought joan a newspaper
clipping joan looking at his grim face
read it   read of the introduction of a
bill in congress to make a capital offense
of radical activities designing the destruc-
tion of property or lives the bill was
skillfully disguised to make it appear that
actual destruction of property or lives must
be proved before a conviction but as blake
explained later in a bitter voice the judg-
ment of the motives of the suspect was really
left to juries

  our officials are determined to drive us
into a bloody revolution he said

  but isnt it always the way with people
heated by passion joan asked she und-
erstood shrewdly the connection between
the cloud pictures and the proposed bill
dont we always fight with our teeth when
we are backed against a wall

  its true blake grunted but were
playing into the hands of whoever is behind
these exhibitions

  on the fifteenth of june as joan was
prepared to begin of her own accord a
search for carol she suddenly heard his
voice over the telephone he sounded eag-
er yet restrained

  where have you been she breathed
carol we thought you were lost

  in hiding he said evasively may i
come up

  yes immediately and in fifteen min-
utes carol was embracing her

  her attempts to draw from him his where-
abouts failed however he admitted that
he had wanted to get away from the city
and had taken peter into the mountains

  please dont question me joan he
seemed aged in the fifteen days

  joan rose helplessly i cant understand
whats come over people she exclaimed
bitterly father is engaged in some secret
activity that he refuses to speak about and
he walks about as though he were pursued
by a ghost now you come to me as
though you were carrying the weight of the


wonder stories

world upon you and to read the news-
papers one would think that the whole world
had gone suddenly mad

  carol managed to quiet her by assuring
her that he would remain in new york now
for some time they passed the late after-
noon in a walk along the precipitous bluffs
of the hudson forgetting in the joy of be-
ing together all worldly cares they re-
turned to joans home in time to greet
blake returning from the city

  carol remained on for dinner a silent
dreary meal each of the three absorbed in
his own thoughts joan watching the men
surreptitiously when dinner was over
blake asked joan to leave him alone with
carol joan hesitated as she saw a sudden
flush come to carols face but yielded only
after saying angrily i suppose the only
thing for me now is to suddenly disappear
and return bearing some great secret   
the men sat opposite each other blake
smoked silently for a moment

  we were rather worried about you my
boy he said finally joan was quite dis-
tracted

  i know said carol i couldnt com-
municate easily

  blake smiled wearily i hadnt meant
to speak of that but to renew a request
i made of you some time ago

  you mean to help you hunt down the
secret of the cloud pictures carol asked
breathlessly 

  blake nodded its more urgent now
carol its damned imperative in fact i
suppose joan has told you whats happened
while you were away

  yes

  you can see for yourself what were
coming to carol blake said leaning for-
ward    ive been studying this thing
every waking hour for the past weeks ive
called into consultation every man of science
who could possibly help me ive become
convinced carol he said decisively that
some gigantic brain is behind it all  
perhaps a perverted brain i dont know
he sank back helplessly into his chair for
a moment as though he could not quite
encompass the thought that he wanted to
express

  but whoever is doing this knows pre-
cisely what he is about he knows the ef-
fect that he wants to create upon people
and with fiendish cunning he is going about
it

  what do you believe his purpose is
carol asked slowly trying not to betray
himself by his voice

  blake looked out of the window beside
them i dont know 	he admitted

thats the beastly part of it ill admit
that with the power the creature possesses
he could have done more damage than he
has he has a sense of humor at least
he has restraint    

  possibly his intentions are good carol
almost whispered 

  blake looked at him sharply

  what do you mean

  carol looked at his shoes just a
thought i meant that it was possible that
he had some good intentions  a chari-
table aim that he was trying to accomplish
blake was thoughtful  perhaps-
to tell the truth it hadnt occurred to me
seriously its hard to believe that a man
could accomplish- some charitable aim
through such means   

  carol afraid he had said too much al-
ready remained silent

  ive investigated this thing from every
angle carol blake went on my theory
has been that the man and there must be
one or a number of men can be found
the scientists i have called in confirm the
fact that the vast power contained in these
exhibitions must be the product of some
genius of science and as such he can be
traced i have been tracing therefore the
activities of every notable man of science
in the world i intend to trace back for
twenty years and to discover who had the
genius necessary to create this thing the
man certainly must have left a trace some-
where i have a corps of men trying to
trace the source of the cloud pictures them-
selves to discover how they are projected
and from where i intend to get to the bot-
tom of this if it takes me the rest of my life
and i want your help     

  why dont you go to the government
carol asked evasively
the time

projector



  no blake said never allow them
to blunder this thing as they have blundered
every other allow politics and self-seek-
ing to enter into it i can only carry this
thing out alone and i intend to until i suc-
ceed

  carol looking at the man believed him
he knew blake to be possessed of a power-
ful penetrating intellect and a sharpness
of understanding that was the scourge of
witnesses and opposing lawyers for a mo-
ment carol felt fearful as though a great
hand were about to crush down upon the
lonely cave and the man known as henry
booth	-v

  frankly carol blake said for this
private search i need money i am devot-
ing my personal fortune to it but i antici-
pate a need for a great deal more you
are the only man i feel inclined to call up-
on    

  carol sat still unable to move on the
face of it he could not refuse  blake
of course knew that his fortune was great
enough to permit the use of several millions
without a thought  yet could he
agree could he aid this powerful and
penetrating man to track down booth and
after all there was a limit to the power of
booth to escape detection 

  i dont know  mr blake    
he said at last allow me to think it over
blake looked at him closely for a few
minutes and then rose very well sir
he said coldly and stepped aside carol
walked to the door and after a quick good-
bye to joan left the house

        chapter viii
        a second letter

again carol sat in the library of his
home seated as he had been three
weeks ago with a letter from his father in
his hands in accordance with his fathers
request he had obtained from bowden
president of the dunfrey national bank the
sealed note that was to be read after he re-
turned from a visit to booth

  it seemed impossible to carol as he sat
fingering the thick sheaf of papers that so

much could have happened to him in twen-
ty-one days-that he had been lifted forcibly
from his quiet students life into the turmoil
of the remaking of a world from a pros-
pect of a life of quiet study and devotion
to the arts he must face now a life of
struggle against the confused forces of his
world in the worlds happiness he must
forget his own shaking off all morbid
thoughts carol turned to the letter in his
fathers handwriting

 my dear son

    i am writing this long letter to you to
 tell you some of the details of my past
 life which may be of assistance to you
 in your new task i am going to leave
 the letter with bowden your reading
 of it now signifies your willingness to
 carry on the work i started years ago

    the last time booth and i talked about
 you he asked me not to give you any
 information about our work till he had
 a chance to talk to you and personally
 make you a convert but i told him that
 i was sure you would fall into line and
 gladly carry on the work i had begun
 yet at the same time i did as he desired
 and informed bowden that this letter
 was to be destroyed if you did not call
 for it within six months

    you know by this time the great need
 of your keeping booths work a secret
 when the time comes he will be looked
 upon as the savior of humanity but be-
 fore that he might easily fall a victim
 to the passions of a frightened but ignor-
 ant world

   you have often wondered just what
 my relations to booth were and how our
 intimacy started it is a long story but
 first i should say that i believe in henry
 booth i know from what he has told
 me and shown me that no man could
 have a nobler and greater task when
 i compare his disinterested passion for
 the worlds betterment with the avarici-
 ous passion for wealth and power of the
 men and women who surround me i be-
 come ashamed of my race and proud of
 henry booth

   my first acquaintance with him came
 in college where we were classmates


wonder stories

 i made fair marks while he led our class
 year after year i often saw him limp-
 ing through the college halls his eyes
 on the ground his arms loaded with
 books with no time for anything but
 study he had been seriously wounded
 in the worlcf war where he had won
 some fame and acquired a shattered
 bodj

   his reputation came from his inde-
 fatigable energy and his amazing ability
 to assimilate and absorb every possible
 branch of science one could not meet
 him even in those student days and not
 feel that he was different from the other
 students

   he was so silent and solitary that not
 one of his class ever came to know him
 perhaps no one ever tried to know him
 and not even the professors were fond
 of him

   my first actual contact with him came
 on a saturday afternoon in spring dur-
 ing my last year at college i had re-
 cently met your mother and was showing
 her through the college buildings

   we passed into the chemical labor-
 atory and stood watching a young man
 the only one in the room performing
 what seemed to be a delicate experiment
 though i knew booth i did not speak to
 him i saw that he was interested in
 what he was doing and did not want to
 embarrass him for i had every reason
 to believe that he was woman shy he
 was holding a bunsen burner under a re-
 tort filled with a brown liquid adjust-
 ing the flame and watching closely the
 timepiece in front of him

we were behind him and suddenly

   v	v i saw him stare into a mirror in
 front of him where he had caught a
 glimpse of us but those few seconds of
 inattention to his work were fatal there
 came a spurt of flame the retort broke
 and the brown liquid was spattered over
 his face he stumbled backwards blind-
 ed i was helpless but your mother re-
 membering her chemistry reached for a
 bottle of neutralizing reagent and start-
 ed to wash the pitiful face urging him in

a low voice to keep quiet and let her
help him

  her quick action undoubtedly saved
his eyesight though it did not prevent his
being badly burned we helped him to
his room and i started at once to get
a doctor for him curiously enough the
whole thing happened without his seeing
anything more of your mother than that
glimpse in the mirror yet she was to
play an important part in his life

  your mother felt strongly that in
some way we were responsible for the
accident and she suggested that i do what
i could for booth up to the time of
our graduation i tried to cultivate him
but my efforts were not successful he
merely tolerated me so i gave it up hope-
lessly

  after my graduation i married your
mother and for some time i lost sight of
booth but your mother kept reminding
me of him and insisted that i at least
learn what he was doing

  eventually i learned that after his
graduation he had been given a fellow-
ship and his remarkable discoveries in
all branches of science had prolonged
this aid

  while he was doing good work fbr
the school he was also carrying on some
private experiments of his own in fact
he had opened a small laboratory and
refused anyone admission to it the
school authorities felt that he was not
treating them fairly and were extremely
dissatisfied

  for nearly five years he carried on
his private work hand to mouth and most
of the time in debt spending all his in-
come on mysterious experiments but
if he learned anything he kept it to him-
self he even refused to allow his name
to be associated with the discoveries he
made while working for the college
when i reported all this to your mother
she stated that she believed if he had a
chance he could do great things she
wanted me to give him that chance

  it was on her account that i made a
visit to him and suggested that he broad-
en the scope of his research i knew
fhe time projector



nothing about his great aim in life at
that time i simply felt that he was
thinking and working on something that
was worth while your mother said at
that time that her intuition told her that
the man was engaged at some noble task

  i found that the five years since grad-
uation had simply served to ripen the
man to make him more confident of him-
self of his ability to carry on his pro-
jects till success came he seemed more
than ever detached from the world com
pletely preoccupied with an all absorb-
ing idea which was constantly growing
more powerful although the scar
across his face had healed it remained
a thing alive as though the skin had been
torn from him to reveal the glow of the
inner man

  i proposed that he come to new york
and open a private laboratory there for
research offering to advance him his ex-
penses against the income from any dis-
coveries he might make i told him he
could thus be free from narrowing re-
strictions and envious companions
imagine my surprise when he accepted
my offer as though he had expected it
all along

  it was only after working under the
new conditions for one year that he trust-
ed me enough to confide in me then
for the first time i learned of his great
aim in life the total abolition of all
war surely a stupendous programme
one man against the world

  but gradually as i saw his scheme

i found myself fascinated by it it was
gigantic yet reasonable if carried to a
logical ending two things had to be 
considered his ability to perfect the
proposed machine and then that his abil-
ity to make the nations of the earth be-
lieve in him i did not doubt that he
could do both

  his research had now reached the
point where it was no longer possible
for him to work in the confines of a great
city the risk of discovery was too great
so we located the west virginia site and
after some years of most difficult con-
struction made more difficult by our need

  of isolation and the few men we could
  depend upon to do the work we arrived
  at a point where booth could proceed to
  make the dream a reality

    i was now in daily touch with him
  we had our plans perfected and through-
  out the world a few trustworthy men who
  would do my bidding in carrying out our
  contacts with the world-such men as
  green and carr whom you will undoubt-
  edly meet

    i was to be the leader to take the
  place in the world made possible for me
  by the knowledge gained by the ma-
  chine this place will now fall upon
  you

    i have seen the completed machine
  carol and the sight of it is unforgettable
  it is like a tremendous vision from a dis-
  tant future age with it man has an op-
  portunity for his betterment that may
  never come to him again place your
  faith in it carol in a few weeks we are
  to start the exhibitions of pictures in
  new york

    i am writing this letter to you be-
  cause anything may happen my heart
  is not in the best of condition and booth
  has asked me to prepare for any eventu-
  alities if you can feel it a duty i want
  you to carry on in this work i can say
  no more

                  your loving father

frank dunfrey

an important conference

carol replaced the letter in the envel-
ope and slowly walked to his fathers
bedroom carefully locking the door in
a clothes closet he opened up the secret
panel holding the private radiovision set
which booth had told him about to use
for instantaneous communication between
them in a few minutes he was face to face
with booth he could not keep his voice
from quivering as he asked mr booth
i have just read fathers letter left for me
did you know he wras going to die

  a shadow crossed booths face i did
but his death was unpreventable there
was nothing to do but to warn him


bonder stories

  then he knew too

  yes booth answered for at least a
month before he died

  and he still carried on carol asked
booth nodded and carol disconnected
the set and slowly folded back the panel to
the closet if his father had carried on
knowing death to be certain for him his
son could do no less

  the next day carol went to jersey city
to see james carr booth had said that he
was one of the most important men in the
organization in charge of the supplies and
their transportation to the cave carol ex-
pected to find a business office but instead
he found a book shop and such a shop

  it was a second-hand store books and
magazines and maps and pictures but lit-
tle system no care but lots of dust carr
was there seated on a soap box he was a
little wrinkled man with a kindly but shrewd
face

  the motto of this shop is welcome and
help yourself he said addressing carol
and if you find what you are looking for
you are a better man than i am gunga din
my arrangement is simple the printed
books on the right side and the books with
printing in them on the left side and other
kinds of books where there are room

  i started this shop over thirty years ago
being left some cash by a great-aunt i
had an idea that i wanted to own a shop to
buy and sell books you can see i have
bought more than i sold i had a system
at first but they came in too fast for me so
i just put my purchases down where ever
i might be at the time i made the bargain
and that is the best way

 suppose- i bought youngs night
thoughts in  i paid a dime for the
book while standing over by that door i
gave the man the money and laid the book
down on the table twenty-five years after
a man came in and asked for that very book
i recalled where i placed it of course by
now it was rather well covered over but at
last i dug it out and wiped the dust off the
man gives me a half dollar for it you can
figure out the profit

  it is a fine business mr carr

  the finest in the world if you want to
sell books if you dont care for books it
could be considered the poorest way ever for
a real man to spend a life time

  carol laughed as he commented on this
last statement

  if i said that you would become angry
not at all i am never angry want
a book i have not sold one for a week
ard i have a feeling that the time is ripe
i will buy a book i have one but if
i purchase another i will be able to better
balance the library table will you advise
one

  no the chances are that you have not
read one in a thousand of the books you
see here shut your eyes and pick any-
one will tell you something you do not
kiow and let me warn you when a man
comes in here dressed as you are i raise
the price i have charged as much as a
dollar for a quarter book

  suppose i take this hogarth send it
to h booth carol said casually

  carr smiled- in this back room i keep
my duplicates walk in it is dusty but
you will soon learn to like it

  he shut the communicating door and led
carol into a real office clean and immacu-
late as a new pin

  you know me asked carol

  of course said carr i worked with
your father for twenty years how is the
master he asked since the unfortunate
death of your father i have been very un-
easy the bankers and politicians are very
restless i have an idea that they will move
heaven and earth to stop the cloud pic-
tures you are replacing your father in
our organization

  not replacing him replied carol quiet-
ly but trying to do what i can to carry
on the work booth asked me to see you
and give you this list of his immediate
needs i will continue my fathers part of
the work and furnish you with funds need
any now

  i have bills for twenty-five thousand
  cash or check carol asked

  no checks mr dunfrey always brought
me the sum in thousand dollar bills could
you do the same

  i can and will tomorrow at the latest
how do you operate mr carr

  i am president carr said of the as-
sociated purchasers inc i buy whatever
booth wants and have it sent to the asso-
ciated warehouse in jersey city one plane
a day piloted by my own son carries to
booth whatever he needs simple
very carol smiled he shook hands
with carr please call on me for whatever
you need by the way how shall i know
if a man is in our organization

  ask him if he knows where you can buy
a copy of the happy life he should tell
you at carrs north by west it may
strike you as being mysterious but its neces-
sary to keep our organization secret for a
time

one hour later carol was closeted with
gerald bowden president of the dun-
frey national bank carol has been urged
by his father in a business memorandum
left for him to rely on the business judg-
ment of bowden he is as solid as the
structure of the country his father had
written half-humorously as bowden
feels so the country goes

  carol was surprised to see a much wor-
ried banker he enquired of the reason

  its these damnable cloud pictures mr
dunfrey bowden explained theyre
slowly but surely pulling the country and
the world into chaos you dont realize
how a thing of this kind can upset the del-
icate balance of our world

  people dont seem to want to work any
more they have become unruly lawless
accidents everywhere are on the increase
rioting radical activity is springing up
everywhere weve had a wave of strikes
a wave of lawlessness as in those days in
the s foreign relations all over the
world have never been in such a precarious
state its enough to make one give up in
despair

  but how do you attribute it all to the
cloud pictures carol asked gently

  its beyond me bowden said wiping
his brow i want to pinch myself at times
to see whether im dreaming or not but
i guess its all true he sighed he sat up-

right as though he must get control over
himself its just this the banker was
himself again these cloud pictures as-
suming that they really do show what is
to happen have convinced people that there
is a power in the world bigger than any of
of us mortals now these pictures have b
gun to show where the business and financial
leaders have blundered and people are
blaming us for everything that happens
well arent they right carol asked
sweetly

  bowden glared were only human
arent we he snapped we dont claim
to be infallible but people seem to have
no respect for authority any more they go
to these exhibitions as though they expected
to see god there  he seemed to absorb
his own words    yes god    now peo-
ple have no desire to do anything except
quarrel with their neighbors fight with
their employers    steal murder 
well whats to be done carol asked
quietly

  done bowden looked at him ques-
tionably what can we do this law to
do away with our radicals should help but
those damned exhibitions must go too why
theyre uncanny that cloud just seems to
float about the city as though it were a
ghost

  carol nodded booth had told him of his
intentions to shift the position of the cloud
each night so that no overt acts might be
taken against it

  but things are bad mr dunfrey the
stock market is in the dumps and business
was never worse luckily for us the bank
is pretty solid your father took care of
that

  he did carol asked surprised

  yes bowden looked at carol with awe
in his eyes it was almost as if your father
expected all this confusion so your inter-
ests are pretty safe

  carol smiled wise old dad he thought
then he decided to take a chance

  do you know mr bowden where i
could get a copy of the happy life
bowden looked at carol in surprise no
what is it

  oh just a book carol said indifferent-


wonder stories

ly but my real business i want to buy
a newspaper

  the surprise on bowdens face deepened
a newspaper

  yes carol smiled i want to become
a journalist can you suggest a good
paper

  bowden pondered a moment its rather
a bad time to make an investment now mr
dunfrey but on second thought the pur-
chase of a newspaper isnt an altogether a
bad thought i might suggest the daily
conservative yes thats it he smiled sly-
ly i suppose you want to take an aggres-
sive hand in this confusion

     carol nodded thats just it an ag-
gressive hand he rose you will arrange
it let me know the price

  bowden shook his hand ill do that i
think you can stir up the authorities to get
rid of these vermin the rest of the press
is demoralized just now

  oh but you mistake my motive mr
bowden carol said innocently i dont
intend to get rid of the vermin you mean

i want the cloud pictures to remain if they
will help us to discover the sore spots in
our social life that will be my policy
carol walked to the door and as he open-
ed it he looked back bowden was stand-
ing just where carol had left him a look
of bewilderment on his round dominating
countenance

         	  

  that evening as pimpkins was laying out
carols clothes carol suddenly walked into
the room he stood for a moment watching
hi valet

  peter he said slowly i want to buy
p copy of the happy life do you know
where i can get one

  peter grinned i was waiting for you to
ask me that sir at carrs north by west
you see sir your father found that to keep
me in his service in such a close-you might
say-intimate position it was necessary to
trust me

  then you knew about the cave carol
asked his eyes twinkling

  yes sir but i had never seen it now

i	have seen it and i am content

  good peter said carol

chapter ix

the coming of chaos

for the next two weeks carol laoored
unceasingly at his desk in the publish-
ers office of the daily conservative to
the astonished and affrighted staff of this
old and respected paper he delivered his
statement of policy

  we are to be the creators of a new
world he told them these cloud pic-
tures are teaching us things our world is
full of sore spots full of inequalities in-
justices stupidities we are going to clean
them up to those who want to work with
me for a new order i offer good jobs to
those who do not i offer my blessings do
you want to stay or go

  the answer was a cheer from his press-
men and reporters the editors remained
discreetly silent but at the end of a week
they were won over they were tired they
said of working on a ceaseless grind of
profit-making-now they could work for the
joy of it

  carol had no illusions about the serious-
ness of his task he saw everywhere about
him the signs of a breakup in the morale of
people in clubs restaurants theatres of-
fices there was an undeniable apprehen-
sion about people a frightened look that
turned occasionally to belligerence as
though they sought among those near them
some one on which to vent their own feel-
ings of futility

  the day after he had purchased the pa-
per carol speaking to booth over their pri-
vate communication set asked if booth would
not cease the exhibitions for a few weeks
it would give people a breathing spell per-
haps a temporary feeling of escape from the
deadly inexorableness of the exhibitions
but booth shook his head his face harden-
ing

no carol they must go on as usual

i	cannot have the world feel that our ene-
mies have conquered us

  but it would be just for a few weeks
carol protested then you could begin
again

no trust me carol booth admonished
the time

projector



carol reluctantly agreed but he did win
from booth the promise that the exhibitions
for two weeks would show nothing alarm-
ing they would be merely inconsequential
happenings a sign only that the power be-
hind the exhibitions still existed

  into the early hours of each morning
carol labored at the organization of his
newspaper establishing firmly his knowl-
edge of current affairs writing editorials
interviewing prominent men to get their
reactions not only on the exhibitions but on
general matters-to feel the pulse of the
world as it were there were problems to
settle with carr about the supplies for the
ccve and with green about the communica-
tions with the few men in foreign countries
who were in sympathy with their cause

  nightly too carol moved about the city
watching the cloud pictures at the place
booth had appointed by booths plans the
cloud moved slowly over the tops of build-
ings so that the crowds could follow it un-
til it settled somewhere about an open
square where the pictures would be shown

  though booth had explained in simple
terms the principles behind the cloud and
its mysterious movements carol could never
lose his feeling of the marvel of it all

  what appears to be a cloud booth had
said is a solidified foam of what i call
benzone it is constructed so that the ridges
in its surface have compensating effect and
do not destroy the continuity of the image
the core of the cloud upon which the cloud
is formed is a magnetic torpedo operated
by carr from the heights of the hudson
above yonkers when the exhibition is
over the cloud rises high into the air a
black fluid is released from the torpedo
which penetrating the cloud makes it prac-
tically invisible at night each evening
carr send it out and recalls it

  the people carol noticed were surly
morose and inclined to be quarrelsome in
great masses they looked at the pictures in
silence and often threw vile words against
the night sky to indicate their defiance of
the force behind the projections

  springing up everywhere were street cor-
ner speakers who harangued crowds of un-

employed warning them of the heel of
the ruling classes that would soon descend
on them some of these self appointed
prophets shouted that the exhibitions were
the work of the capitalists who were try-
ing to frighten the people into economic
slavery but the speakers themselves were
plainly puzzled by their own words they
uttered phrases whose meanings they could
not understand

  at one corner carol saw a lean wild-
eyed man shouting hoarsely to a crowd that
listened in stony silence the man pointed
tj the cloud that was floating slowly down
upon them listen you sinners he
screamed the day of judgment has come
on this white cloud is written your fate
just as sodom and gomorrah  but he
got no further there were hoarse shouts
from the crowd a surging forward fists
flew screams came from the frightened
man as carol saw him go down under
blows from a dozen men for a moment
carol stood there hypnotized then sud-
denly as a detachment of police charged
down upon the crowd it melted away up-
on the street his head a bloody pulp lay
the prophet his sightless opened eyes gaz-
ing upward to the sky from which the
avenger was to come carol turned away
sickened

  though he telephoned joan occasionally
and received cool answers from her carol
could find no time to leave his burden of
work to see her

  just a few days more joan he plead-
ed then ill be free for you

  oh theres no hurry she would say
frigidly and hang up the receiver

  finally in desperation he telephoned her
one day and asked to see her at once deep
in his subconscious was a need for a wo-
mans love and joan was the only woman
he knew who could fill that need he must
see her now for his weeks of grace from
booth were up and he knew-that in a few
days booth would again begin to project
the inexorable fates of men and with the
present temper of people carol knew he
must remain at all times in close touch with
the world


wonder stories

it was restful to be with her that after-
noon in her spacious high ceilinged room
he sat a lonely young man listening to her
play chopin grieg and schumann while
through the french windows he could look
down upon the velvet lawn and to the splash
of the hudson

  joan was lovely cool and restful but
today she was distant until finally she came
over to him

  carol whats come between us what is
this terrible thing in you that is estranging
us

  carol smiled wearily im trying to re-
form the world dear quite a task for a
young man

  its not that carol she shook her head
theres something else burdened on you

  its nothing he insisted and as if to
save him from further answer blake entered
the room his manner outwardly stiff
was underneath cordial to carol

  youre running a newspaper i hear he
said an attempt at friendliness

  trying to mr blake carol said off-
handedly

  he looked at blake sharply the man
seemed to have aged in weeks his formerly
plump face was thin and drawn his hair
had whitened perceptibly his back stoop-
ed he looked as though he were trying to
avoid some horrible inescapable fate

  are you ill sir he asked solicitously

  perhaps blake mumbled he pointed
to his brow but its here he sat down
carol i want your help again no not
what you mean  he waved carol back
to his seat

  carol he asked suddenly did you
ever hear your father speak of a henry
booth

  carol clutched at his chair as though he
were about to fall through a bottomless
pit

  booth he asked confused could
blake have learned already it seemed in-
credible

  why i dont think so

  blake shook his head i suppose not
he turned to joan will you ask him to
help us

  joan took carols hand yes carol

try to think didnt your father ever speak
of him she turned back to her father
but daddy this isnt fair we must tell
carol what its all about     

  thats true blake nodded to tell
the truth carol i think i have found my
man    the man of the cloud pictures 
carol gazed at blake stonily he would
not betray booth though they tried to torture
him but now he must hide any sign of
recognition of the name

  in the course of my search blake went
on i was determined to overlook no clue
nc matter how remote i felt as i told you
before that the man-and i am convinced
now that this thing has one big brain be-
hind it-must have left a trace of himself
somewhere my men searched the libraries
the laboratories the patent offices the
scientific clubs the universities all over the
world we looked into the records of hun-
dreds of men and followed thousands of
blind clues i have only one that shows any
promise and curiously enough it lead to
someone your father might have known
carol remained silent he could not
feign surprise yet he must avoid any indi-
cation of suspicion to those searching black
eyes that were watching him so intently

  the only clue i found blake said
was this book he took a little volume
from his pocket and handed it to carol

  carol read the title the mathematics
of causation by henry booth it was
dated at cambridge mass 

  he handed it back to blake

  this book blake went on is an at-
tempt to apply mathematics to the causation
of events the author taking the stand that
one could chart mathematically the course
of history or politics or economics and pro-
ject it into the future its a youthful vol-
ume but it has a remarkable penetration
into the subject

  blake smiled a wan smile it makes me
almost believe in it

  but you do daddy joan interrupted
carol looked from one to the other

  booth i found blake went on balanc-
ing the book in his hand graduated from
massachusetts tech in  and from
there his trail ceased until i found a pro-
the time

projector



fessor there who had been a student after
booth graduated he said he remembered
booth asa silent secretive man who had
made some rather remarkable discoveries

iii	chemistry and physics though they were
not generally credited to him but in 
booth disappeared and left no trace what-
ever and there the trail drops i feel that
booth is my man

  he sat back silently as though to ponder
his words

  carol felt joans eyes on his he looked
at her soberly

  tell carol how this concerns him dad-
dy joan asked

  it happens carol blake said that
your father graduated from massachusetts
tech in the same class as booth 

  and daddy thinks joan went on im-
pulsively that if you can only remember
just one little mention of him that it may
be the clue to finding the man    please
think hard carol 

  what is it joan carol asked do
you want to see this man destroyed

  joan nodded emphatically ntw i do
carol at first not because i was over
awed by the exhibitions and i felt that per-
haps if people could see the truth it might
really make them free but now when i
see how miserable everyone is how restless
how uneasy the whole world is with this
strange force in it i cant help but feel that
it must go    the world was never meant
t  have it dont you feel that way

  i dont know joan carol said truth-
fully doubts were really assailing him

  but about booth blake persisted
cant you remember anything

  you see father must have known him
before i was born carol said defensively
he didnt care to lie to these friends he
didnt want to be forced to it

  but wasnt there any mention of him
whatever in your fathers life

  theres none that i can say  carol
answered

  then wont you help daddy to find this
man carol joan pleaded

  carol rose im sorry joan but theres
really nothing that i can do

  the color left joans face not for

me

  im sorry

  joan stiffened i believe were detain-
ing mr dunfrey daddy

  carol nodded to both of them and walk-
ed from the room

  in the city he walked about more lone-
some than ever this meant now that he
had alienated joan forever for he could
never at least not until it was too late tell
her his secret she was definitely in the
enemys camp

  must he bear this secret alone then he
looked into peoples faces to see the won-
der and bewilderment there and felt as
though the desire to blurt out to them what
h knew would become an irresistable urge
the desire to tell kept hammering tortur-
ing at his brain tell   tell   tell

wth a lull in the force of the exhibi-
tions over a period of several weeks
public attention became focussed on the bill
before congress to impose the capital pen-
alty upon agitators aiming at the destruc-
tion of property and lives

  with powerful sentiment behind the bill
it seemed destined to pass despite the mut-
terings from the liberal and radical press
but what shocked the country was to find
one morning on the front page of the daily
conservative editor carol dunfrey an edi-
torial denouncing the proposed bill are
we blind was the title in great black let-
ters and there followed in short bold sen-
tences are we blind to the forces that
have created this bill are we blind to its
purpose to stifle all free thought are
we blind to the intention of one oligarchic
group to hold the nation by the throat
are we blind to the fact that it is the fear
of the cloud pictures that is causing this
cowardly reprisal against an unknown en-
emy are we blind to the fact that these
pictures may help us out of the pits of our
own follies

                     universal sorrow the
                     annual days of sacri-

an evil omen to await the next sacrifice

  the effect of this universal mourning on
hi was characteristic of him somehow he
could not mold himself to the general ac-
ceptance of the inevitable as with the
majority of the i f p men the sight of
the black tower filled him with bitter anta-
gonism his pugnacious though ordinar-
ily pleasant face reddened and his close-
cropped sandy hair under the small close-
fitting skullcap of the service seemed to
bristle he went with the crowd his nar-
rowed blue eyes dangerous the people
made way for him and so the soldierly fig-
ure in uniform easily distinguishable in
that sea of bright colors and flowing robes
soon reached the long
ramps that led down to
the half-mile circle at the
base of the black tower

several hundred yards
away under the frowning
black stone the sacrifi-
cial platform was filling

a city policeman hailed
him

  just in hi

  hi recognized an ac-
quaintance

  great time to come
home eh he grunted

  might as well come
with me i can get you
through the lines

  somewhat reluctantly
hi went with him a
strong cordon of police surrounded the plat-
form-a precaution against rescuing parties
which were sometimes organized by the
friends and families of the victims they
sat on the stone steps leading to the plat-
form

  toughest assignment for a man on the
city police to draw his friend stated
people seem to think its our fault some-
how look how they glare at usi they
hate us

  yeh hi agreed gloomily and yet
he added with vehemence if they left it to
us wed clean up that mess of devils or die
trying

  i know that the city policeman agreed

  readily you fellows did put up a beauti-
ful scrap and it was only because of orders
from home that you quit before theyd re-
duced all your ships to nothing

  he was referring of course to that short
decisive battle which more than fifty years
ago twenty-five years before hi was born
had ended with the complete subjugation of
the human race-until then the lawgivers
and law enforcers of the solar system the
terrestrials still policed the solar system
but only on sufferance of the plutonians
and the far-flung orbit of pluto itself was
taboo to the ubiquitous patrols of the
i f p

a sigh passed like a
wave over the mul-
titude and an old man
clad in a robe of dead
black with white border
stepped out of the tower
on to the empty stage
on his head was an ugly
box-like cap of mourn-
ing in his withered
hand he carried a wand
or staff of purple trans-
parent material his
white beard quivered in a
slight breeze as he took
his place before the am-
plifier microphones he
looked expectantly tow-
ard the seats intended for
the sacrifices who now
filed out of the dark tower dressed all in
white the girls most of them were led
oi the arms of tower servants the young
men walking alone came with enforced
calm

  it was a pitiable effort chalk-faced the
sacrifices had reached the stage of merciful
numbness they took their seats fumbling-
ly hi could not bear to look at them
under his breath he cursed the age-old hu-
man fetish for making a show of everything
how much kinder to let them spend their
last few hours on earth alone

the public apologist-hes starting
in a quavering voice that sounded grotes-
que when powerfully amplified the old

r f starzl
the planet ob despair



man began his discourse bowing low to
the sacrifices he spoke

  in the name of all humanity   

  it was the traditional formula

  in the name of all humanity i beg of
you forgiveness that we may live you
must go to your death so it has been year
after year for half a century we pray
that it may not be so forever

  it is not want of courage on the part of
humanity that sends you away on even
terms-on much less than even terms-
would the earthmen give battle to pluto
but you all know how helpless we are is
not that terrible year of  still fresh in
the minds of people still living the year
when the plutonians discovered their gra-
vity distorting beam the year that earth
left its orbit around the sun and flew off
on a tangent the year that we saw the sun
dwindle and pale while the deathly frost
diove us into the deepest mines when even
the winds died and the air condensed like
water on the surface of the earth   

  one of the girl sacrifices-a maid of
eighteen suddenly burst into a hysterical
shriek two nurses carried her quickly in-
to the tower

  oh we fought them continued the apo-
logist our ships flew to pluto as iron
flies to a magnet but as atomic cohesion
is only another function of gravity their
distorting beam sufficiently intensified ac-
tually caused the atoms of which ships men
and weapons were composed to disinte-
grate who can fight an enemy like that

  so we were forced to this treaty-to sac-
rifice fifteen young men and fifteen girls
every year-in order that all humanity
might live the plutonians thereupon re-
turned our planet to its orbit their emis-
saries are here are you ready

  if the poor victims had been able to say
anything their voices were drowned by the
noise of the mob confused shouts shrieks
hysterical laughter someone started a
patriotic song and it was instantly caught
up screamed in something of a frenzy by
nearly half a million people

  sickened hi turned to go but a fresh
outburst made him turn back a plutonian
had come out of the tower stooping to get

  his tremendous bulk through the door his
black lack-lustre eyes viewed the public
indifferently puzzled perhaps by that mael-
strom of emotion that encompassed the en-
tile range from bitter hate to adulation

  the plutonian was fernon the scientist
who was to officially accept the sacrifices
he was black with a hard glossy blackness
twelve feet tall he stalked in like a con-
quering colossus only superficially did
he resemble human form for his powerful
legs had webs not feet from his repul-
sive wrinkled head sprouted two brilliant
crimson knobs the ears were small close
to the head and sharply pointed

  fernon was entirely naked draped only
by the tattered and burned looking remains
of what had been great batlike wings in his
youth a thousand years ago from a belt
dingled an ordinary heat-ray weapon from
a ligament on one shoulder sprouted a
young plutonian about six inches tall and
fully formed for the plutonians have no
sex reproducing by fission like the sim-
ple earth cells the young plutonian was
squalling and cursing in a tiny mosquito-
like voice but fernon paid him no attention
whatever

  on fernons face the most nearly human
thing about him-was that same expression
common to all plutonians-an expression
of neither good nor evil showing no pas-
sion or emotion save that of vague curios-
ity as he glanced at the teeming and hos-
tile multitude he seemed to be looking
through them eternally seeking for the ans-
wer to some cosmic riddle

a daring exchange

following fernon came the renegade
technic bilks one of the few humans
in the service of the dark lords bilks was
huge for a human being though dwarfed
by his master he was hairy truculent
but now as he darted furtive looks from
side to side he was sweating with nervous-
ness he had no physical violence to fear
but it was as if his brain could not with-
stand the silent storm of contemptuous hate
that beat against him naro plutonian


wonder stories

master of the sacrifice ship stooped to look
out and nodded his head

  go in fernon waved his hand tersely
careless

  amid a deep silence the sacrifices started
to file in hi buckram watched them with
deep pity and a girl whom he had no-
ticed before turned so that he saw her tear
wet face she saw him at the same time
shook her head with a pathetic smile

  cinda

  hi was clambering up the stone side of
the platform his friend of the city police
pulled him back

  stop he muttered whats the use
i didnt know she was your girl

  let me go hi panted but several of
the city guards seized him a low growl
welled up terrifyingly all around until it
btcam a bestial roar and the guards be-
came the center of a battle royal these
riots were not uncommon and as the city
police battled for their lives hi managed to
escape but against the press of the mill-
ing mob he was unable to win his way back
to the platform before the door of the tow-
er was closed hi looked at it for a long
time unmindful of the tumult and when
at last he went away it was with the air
of a man who has determined to stake his
life on a desperate venture fully expecting
tc lose

	 

  the banquet of the sacrifices was in pro-
giess night had turned the heavens black
spreading over a dream city as far as
the eye could see were exquisite pillars
towers arches bathed in milky light and
flooded with rainbow colors but the win-
dowless tower of sacrifice was black and
dark within it the choicest specimens of
humanity sat at tables laden with selected
viands that they coukl not eat while a fam-
ous director was leading a symphony of
colors and sound that went unheeded

  servants came and went wearing the
special striped black and white sacrificial
robes that were used for this purpose only
guards scrutinized carefully the badges they
wore for it was a strictly enforced rule that
whoever permitted a sacrifice to escape must
himself be executed or if physically perfect

enough to take the escaped sacrifices place

  as one of these servants passed along the
base of the tower in the shadow a sturdy
young man wearing the conventional long
loose robe accosted him

  say fellow howd you like to make a
tenner and have the rest of the evening
off

  cant do it whoever you are and be-
sides i dont handle nothing but fruit
juices another guy has the sacrificial
merclite

  im not looking for merclite explained
the stranger i want to take the place of
one of those fellows in there

  i never heard of any exchanges this
late objected the servingman suspicious-
ly why dont you go see the conscript-
ing judges

  i did but theyre afraid of the political
effect but-well my girl is in there you
see im hi buckram of the i f p i
cant let her go out there alone listen
here fool dye know what that means

  it means the same to the rest of em
the man remarked unfeelingly stooping to
pick up his burden

  hi knocked him out and dragged him in-
to a niche in the wall where he changed
clothes with him then he boldly walked
in carrying a case of bottled goods with
him fortunately he was met by an excited
caterer whose impatient admonitions to
hurry amused the guards hi caught a
glimpse of the banquet hall with more than
half the places around the great table emp-
ty that meant that many of the sacrifices
would be wandering around the tower

  he found his lucky man dispiritedly com-
ing down the long spiral ramp which
wound around the central space ship well
of the black tower hastily explaining the
situation hi effected another change of
clothing curtly stopped the boys flood of
incredulous thanksgiving at any moment
the call for the examinations might come
and if the full quota of the sacrifices failed
to respond there would be an investigation
he reached the lower levels just in time

fernon was already at work one at
a time the sacrifices would be taken
the planet of despair



before him stark naked and subjected to a
searching physical examination to the
girls most of them delicately reared fer-
nons impersonal examination was far less
intolerable than the hungry officiousness of
the renegade bilks fernon saw this and
sent bilks out but the plutonian showed no
great interest until he regarded hi buck-
rams muscular body

  are you the one they call tycho lar-
us fernon inquired rumblingly

  i am hi replied without hesitation
tycho larus was the name of the youth
with whom he had exchanged

  they lied about your age tycho lar-
us fernon remarked making a perfunc-
tory adjustment in a mass of strange in-
struments

  it is perhaps your machine that lies
hi rejoined evenly

  you are actually twenty-four years old
fernon pursued which is contrary to the
covenant

  all right hi exclaimed harshly let
me go then

  oh i dont know fernon thought for
a moment it is perhaps because you
earthlings have kept too well to the cove-
nant that we have failed in our quest he
squeezed his arm in his ironhard grip un-
til the soldier winced

  yes he mused there is something
about you which these others lacked are
you happy

  hi looked at fernon steadily not speak-
ing

  yes i see fernon said after a mo-
ment you would be happy to fight me
usually they are soft and whining and beg
for mercy but i never have found out
what mercy is except not to do the thing
that you are going to do

  with a small pocket transparency ray
fernon carefully examined his inner or-
gans good stomach he mumbled good
lungs very good heart brain convolutions
excellent a firmness about you tycho
larus that indicates you will be a good
scibject by my knobs but you are a stout
one you seem to feel no more fear than i
here how did you get that burn on your
shoulder

  that oh that happened to stand
back of a rocket plane when it started hi
falsified

  these earthlings are in need of a les-
son the covenant stipulates that the sac-
rifices must be free from blemish still--
ill accept you you may be more useful
in our research than the others

	 

  on board the aegeida the sacrifices were
well treated the youths and the girls had
separate quarters comfortable though they
now had to do without servants bilks and
nara were the only crew as the ship was
a small one fernon appeared occasionally
to check up the health of his charges but
did not disturb them otherwise some of
the victims were still sunk in dull apathy
while others conscious that the end was
near sought the solace of love and com-
panionship to help them forget

  fernon continued to take unusual interest
in hi known to him as tycho he did not
fail to observe the attachment between him
and the fair-haired girl who called herself
cinda mara one day he asked

  earthling it strikes me that the ancient
wisdom of our race is faulty although we
are in every way superior to you in your
puny shortlived bodies is something that
we have not something finer something
that we can no more imagine than you can
imagine the color of ultra-violet which does
not affect your eyes what is happiness
seems to me im specially favored hi
remarked warily what do you want to
know about happiness

  what is it is it what you call emo-
tion you call them love hate happi-
ness sadness what are they for fifty
years the great scientists of our race have
tried to learn although we separated you
in tiny bits we could not find out what made
you as you are but we know there is
something we have seen that to the earth
animals their trifling span of life is more
than our great spans are to us but why
tc solve that riddle would be a great scien-
tific accomplishment

   hi looked into the gigantic black face that
loomed above him fernons disclosure
reminded him sharply that to the pluton-


wonder stories

ian he was no more than a mouse under the
knife of a laboratory investigator the
dead black eyes seemed not even to be look-
ii g at him but through him into the nebu-
losity of a cosmic secret

  for fifty of your years since the time
of the covenant i have been bringing home
the ship of sacrifice always they have been
the same the very young of your race
taken to a fate which they no doubt dislike
somehow seem to draw from some inner
source strength-tell me- and the pluton-
ians gaze was all at once direct and pene-
trating-tell me is it their souls

hi buckram former corporal of the
i f p alias tycho larus laughed in
fernons emotionless face he slapped his
thigh he doubled up and shouted until the
tears ran down his face at the grisly ab-
surdity of fernons casual disclosure how
interested they would be on earth to learn
what fernon had just said for the pluton-
ians had never deigned to explain the object
of their research before any more than the
terrestrial scientists considers it necessary
to explain to his guinea pigs why he js cut-
ting them up

  listen he gasped when the paroxy-
sm had passed why long ago-long be-
fore even you split from your parent-
many generations of yours ago your an-
cestors were looking for the very same
thing they came to the earth somebody
sold them on the idea that earth people are
different because they have souls they
spent a lot of time and did a lot of harm
chasing around for souls they certainly
earned themselves a bad reputation but
they never found any souls

  tradition is that they did fernon in-
sisted stubbornly but as the great work
was about to be consolidated they met un-
expected resistance the earthlings learn-
ed to fight earth was abandoned and it
was not until we invented the gravity dis-
tortion beam that we could renew our re-
search

  well of all the dumb- hi forgot bis
own position as he looked at fernon with
exasperated wonder searching for souls-

what were you going to do with them-
eat em how do you handle em

  well fernon started to explain we
go at it in various ways- and with meti-
culous attention to technical detail fernon
explained the contacting theories of var-
ious plutonian schools of vivisection until
hi no longer saw any humor in the situa-
tion but swayed white-faced thinking of
cinda

	 

  pluto was occulting more and more stars
the planet itself was dim a vague mon-
strous mass that seemed to hang menacingly
a little above and to the right of the ships
bow to the sacrifices it seemed to grow
with ominous swiftness now it blotted out
the entire heavens and then the ship lurched
as the bow rockets were started to deceler-
ate

  a pilot ship of the plutonian patrol fleet
flashed by them convoying them over hun-
dreds of miles of icy sterile terrain until at
last directly below them lay a yawning
black pit immeasurably deep the ship
dropped like a plummet nara the master
anxiously watching the dull red glow that
presently appeared below again came
that swift deceleration and the ship darted
into a gigantic lateral tunnel illuminated
by a lurid smoky light from a source some-
where in the depths which hi assumed to
be of volcanic origin here it was rumor-
ed were the giant thermocouples from which
the plutonians drew incredible amounts of
power

a bargain

i 

the rockets were now cut off and the
ship was carried and drawn along by
gigantic magnetic levitators attached to the
ceiling of the great tunnel there was ar-
tificial lighting from long blood-red tubes
it seemed very insufficient to his eyes but
he knew that the tubes no doubt emitted
large quantities of infra-red light by which
the plutonians see best

  while the plutonians used the gravity dis-
torting beam in navigating some of their space
ships those touching the earth were not so
equipped lest the terrestrials capture one and
learn the secret of the beam
the planet of despair



  so they came at last to a plutonian city
a fantastic conglomeration of angular mis-
shapen buildings that looked like a wilder-
ness of black basaltic rocks the bloody
red light seemed to lap them like waves of
fire it streamed in through the ports
painting the pale faces of the sacrifices

  the aegeida touched the ground within
high walls clean metal cages were carried
out by a number of plutonians the sacri-
fices herded into them and locked up at-
tendants carried the cages to a number of
tables in a great pentangular room which
was flooded with the throbbing red light
they saw to food and water and then de-
parted

  so thats that hi buckram remarked
he had clung to cinda mara and she was
in the same cage with him his heartening
presence had somehow raised her courage
he looked down at her now she was sit-
ting on the floor looking at him with adora-
tion with confidence hi had told her that
the i f p had perfected a new weapon
and would make a surprise attack to rescue
them adjuring her to keep that fact a sec-
ret of course she believed the blessed lie

for in times of extreme peril it is human

 i    
to be optimistic

  as for himself hi was too hard-headed
to indulge in such hopes but he had pro-
mised himself that his own body and that
cf cinda should be useless to the plutonian
investigators in case a certain farfetched
and doubtful plan of his should fail

  but first he would play that long chance
fernons casual disclosure of the plutonian
search for some kind of a usable soul-es-
sense had somewhat reduced their mental
stature in his estimation perhaps they
could be tricked the trick might yield
much at the least it might yield a chance
to reduce the population of the dismal plan-
et somewhat

  they slept on little shelves around the
sides of their cages after some hours a
plutonian came bringing food and water
but fernon did not return until the equi-
valent of a day later bringing with him a
young assistant of three or four hundred
years they looked over their captives
discussing in their guttural purring lan-

guage the work they intended to do hi
buckram had a smattering of that tongue
and mused that it wras well the other cap-
tives did not

  we will try this one first fernon de-
cided opening the door of his cage and
reaching inside the other captives ran
crouching into the farthest corner but hi
went forward to meet the great black arm
he seized the wrist and vaulted into a sit-
ting position in the crook of fernons arm

  it wont be long before i see you cinda
dear he called cheerily she did not see
the fine dew of perspiration that covered his
face and was reassured

  again fernon paid him tribute

  look ushtur he rumbled to his assist-
ant how tractable it is the others squeal
and kick a good subject it is the one
i told you about

  hi squirmed about until he faced the huge
scientist

  hey i want to talk to you

  fernon let him stand on a work bench
so that his eyes were on a level with the
dead black questing ones

  i have something of importance to tell
you take me where we can be alone
to tell me of what

  of what you want to know

  fernon picked hi up strode into another
wing of the great underground laboratory
this room seemed to be the one in which
the actual work was done for it was equip-
ped with a wilderness of chemical and re-
search apparatus including huge tanks and
test tubes as tall as a man in which perhaps
the plutonians sought to isolate the elusive
soul substance of humanity

  now tell

  fernon hi said with an air of extreme
frankness i do not wish to die

  perhaps not fernon remarked indif-
ferently

  there is a girl in one of your cages
whom i love i wish to live and with her
all our specimens wish to live fer-
non displayed slight impatience

  my proposition is simply this set us
free-let us live in your service-and i will
show you how to extract the soul essence
you are looking for


wonder stories

fernon did not hesitate to strike the
bargain the plutonians had found
other earth renegades useful

  you may try he remarked if you
fail you and your female can still serve as
specimens

  there are certain matters of equipment
i will need hi stipulated

  you shall have them

  during one process of the reduction i
shall need a tremendous amount of power
we have power enough 

  and the work must be performed some-
where where the cosmic rays from outside
can reach us they are essential with-
out them the experiment must fail

  we could lay power conduits to the sur-
face but that is five of your miles fer-
non was dubious

  then hi with elaborate casualness made
the suggestion that was at the very core of
his plans

  in that pit where you keep your gravity
distorting beam-the big one i mean-you
have both power leads and access to the
outside also plenty of room

  but fernon was cool toward the sugges-
tion

  we could use the pit we came in through
but not the pit of the beam he objected
we can not use that it is the very heart
of our defenses always under heavy
guard only by special permission of the
prince could we use it and i doubt that
he would give it

  you can ask him cant you hi arg-
ued well if you wont do it i wont
work for you here he pulled open his
robe baring his chest go ahead and
carve me see what you can find out

  but fernon did not attempt to wrest the
secret from his breast with a scalpel he
locked hi securely back in his cage and
went to see the overlord of the planet the
other specimens crowded to hi and excited
cries echoed from cage to cage this tough
and cocky young fellow had come back
alive as he had promised he had vaguely
promised something more they dared to
hope again

  hi managed to shake the others off drew
cinda to a corner and sat down with her

  things are looking up he murmured
i made a deal with him

  it was another twenty-four hours before
fernon returned the victor of a battle in
council on his hand tfle ring with the aug-
ust seal of the prince which made the wear-
er for the time being the equivalent of vice
regent in so far as this applied to his own
profession his leathery old wings were
even more tattered and useless than they
had been before but fernon did not even
bother to explain to hi that his victory had
included a duel to the death with orfas
former custodian of the pit of the beam
he merely told hi that the required per-
mission had been obtained

  the pit was perhaps thirty miles from the
hideous city where the prisoners were kept
it was a funnel like depression in the outer
skin of pluto about a hundred yards in dia-
meter at the bottom with walls inclined at
an angle of forty-five degrees it had been
formed quite simply after the beam had been
constructed in the underground cavern se-
lected for it by directing the beam against
the roof of the cavern all the enormous
mass of superincumbent rock five miles
thick deprived of its gravity was thrown
out into space by centrifugal force

  in the center of the hundred-yard circle
which hi entered with his giant companion
was the beam hi looked at it curiously
although he was by no means a scientist
he had a smattering of such things that was
as far advanced over our present scientific
knowledge as a present-day radio amateur
is advanced over a peasant of the dark ages
somehow hi had expected to see a gigantic
searchlight of some sort even the heat-
ray weapons he was accustomed to were
like that but the beam of gravity distor-
tion seemed to emanate from a triangular
arrangement of three polished metal bars
several feet thick and about fifty feet long
joined at the corners by polished metal
balls about six feet in diameter the tri-
angle was balanced horizontally on massive
gimbals capable of swinging the beam in
any direction

  hi had been toying with a vaguely de-
fined plan to break through the guard turn
or the beam and direct it against the plu-
the planet of despair



tonians themselves some time during the
construction of his soul-reduction mach-
ine now he saw that the movement of the
triangle was limited by a massive quadrant
that would not permit its being turned be-
yond the angle of the pits walls the
prince with foresight had seen to it that
the weapon would be used against the out-
side world alone revolutionists would
find little inducement here

the great strategy

fernon held up the princes ring and
the guards reluctantly raised their hands
in salute and token of submission there
were about twenty of them around the
beam as big as fernon but younger and
stronger strong guards were at each of
the numerous entrances of the pit and
walking guards armed like the rest with
heavy maces and heat rays paced their
beats the pulsating red light was over
all lapping at the rock walls streaming out
into space on earth hi knew it was
thought that this red light was the beam
itself

  begin fernon commanded

  where are the main power leads
you can connect up at one of those
small red doors

  very well but i will have to set up my
apparatus near the center of the floor to
get the cosmic rays from all sides

  fernon grumbled at that the guards
complain about your getting so close to the
beam

  let em complain fii rejoined show
em the ring this is important business
under his direction fernon and his as-
sistants set up a nightmarish conglomeration
of tubes coils polished bells condensers
it must have puzzled the plutonians for it
appeared to be nothing but a contraption
for the dissipation of electrical energy
which in fact is all it was but the end
finally came and hi declared the formi-
dable monstrosity complete

  now bring on your specimens and dont
forget your promise hi commanded as
fernon turned to go he added

on second thought better bring em in

the aegeida thats more like home to em
it will quiet them and make it easier to get
the clear soul essence the special solvent
ray which i use at first will penetrate the
metal of the hull easy enough later we
will have to remove them for further treat-
ment

  fernon regarded hi steadily he mused

  the further i go with this the more i am
convinced that your mind is twisted some-
where but if it is your intention to try
and escape through the pit with the ship
you are warped worse than i realize there
will be a heavy guard and if you fail
to do what you have promised you will be
the first subject of a new line of research
which may be-very-painful

  bring em in hi repeated

  the aegeida was brought through her
ports flushed pink by the throbbing lights
could be seen strained faces plutonians
negligently dangling their maces rode
atride the hull or walked along then as
the plutonians and the renegade bilks left
the ship occupied only by the sacrifices
heavy heat weapons were trained on the
hull should the hapless passengers at-
tempt to move away under their own power
they could be instantly reduced to cinders

  the girl hi turned to fernon bring
her out as you promised me

  the female remains fernon replied
without change of expression or intonation
we have need of her soul substance now
but if you succeed you shall have your
choice of all the females in the solar sys-
tem

   fernons refusal half expected filled hi
with elation for it simplified one phase of
his plan considerably but he was careful
not to show it instead he affected resent-
ment

  all right he barked you go back on
your agreement and i wont carry on with
mine

  the research i have in mind fernon
rumbled is like this we think that per-
haps your soul substance is in the bones
we will therefore remove all the bones in
your body being careful not to let you die
and note the changes if any we will know
then  


wonder stories

  all right all right hi shouted and
the sick look on his face was not acting
here goes

  he pulled a lever and the astonishing
collection of electrical misfits he had con-
structed collapsed upon itself the col-
lapse had the appearance of haphazardness
but two massive bars of copper connected
to the five-inch cable that writhed over the
floor like a monstrous serpent fell straight
toward the beam two of the guards saw
them toppling and dashed forward to seize
them they vanished in an arc of blinding
light and searing heat the bars continued
their fall carrying the arc with them it
enveloped the quadrant and in a few sec-
onds the metal began to drip on the floor

  hi dashed through a pair of plutonian
legs scratching his face on wiry hairs so
that it bled he was through the guard
line clambering through the understructure
of the great weapon a sentry saw him
through a billowing cloud of red tinted
smoke but hi dashed into a maze of rods
and levers where the black giant could not
reach him neither could the heat rays be
directed into that delicately constructed
heart of calamity

  the arc flared out someone had pulled
the switch at the wall panel the pluton-
ians as well as hi were blinded but as one
of the former lurched against the delicately
balanced triangle hi realized that the quad-
rant had been burned off he crawled to
one of the sides heaved mightily and slow-
ly very slowly the tremendous mass
weighing many tons turned on its bear-
ings

a guard noticed it leaped upon the
rising side to bear it down another
one also leaped immediately the triangle
tipped the other way gathering momentum
before the bewildered guards could collect
themselves the triangle had turned clear
around and the dangerous side of the bars
was turned directly to the center of the plan-
et someone attempted to start the con
trolling motor but the connecting links
were warped by the heat and the only effect
was to wedge the triangle in its dangerous
position

  hi burrowed deeper into the strange
mechanism in the base of the great weapon
he took frightful chances crawling through
massive coils that might be charged with
electricity squeezing between the teeth of
enormous cogs the plutonians were still
probing for him from above when hi crawl-
ed out below almost under their feet and
very cautiously looked around

  he saw the aegeida still under vigilant
guard the strained faces of the sacrifices
at the ports and on the floor was the body
of fernon his head split straight between
the knobs by a mace the young pluton-
ian had managed to break the ligament
however and make his escape

  hi had vainly been looking for a way to
actuate the great beam knowing that the dis-
tortion or reversal of plutos gravity would
make the entire planet fly to pieces of its
own centrifugal force now he noticed an
inconspicuous kiosk about thirty feet away
the patent jealousy with which it was guard-
ed by two of the plutonians indicated its
real importance especially when the pre-
carious position of the triangle was con-
sidered

  now all i have to do is get rid of those
two fellows hi thought grinning a little
his eyes narrowed speculatively for he had
noticed fernons ray weapon still hanging
at his belt in order to reach the body he
had to cross a well lighted space once
he might make it but back again-well-

  but he did not have to make it back one
of the dead scientists capes had flopped
awkwardly over one side of the body under
its sheltering obscurity hi crawled stifling
his disgust as he felt the sticky hot blood
he dragged fernons heat ray with him
found a rent in the leathery covering and
looked out

  the plutonians were still looking for
him under the frame of the beam per-
haps they thought him mangled and dead
beneath there and the two guards still
kept close watch over a wheel-it looked
like an ancient water ships wheel-in the
kiosk

  hi set the localizer on the ray which
would concentrate it in a narrow beam
sighted on the nearer of the two guards
the planet of despair



that one dropped silently and the other
died a second later like a flash hi bound-
ed across the floor he had difficulty reach-
ing the control wheel but reach it he did
before any of the other plutonians were
aware of what had happened-spun the
wheel frantically

  immediately he was conscious of a feel-
ing of weightlessness almost instantly
came the pangs of suffocation and the bite
of cold hi realized that pluto was indeed
flying to pieces by some chance possi-
bly because only the rock directly below
them was in the path of the spreading beam
the part of plutos crust that held the pit
ard adjacent territory had broken away in
one piece nevertheless it did not have
sufficient mass to hold an atmosphere and
their air was rushing out into space

  the crimson lights still pulsed with diabo-
lical life indicating that they were still con-
nected with the great thermocouples but
at any moment that connection might be
broken the beam would lose its power
and the fragments of pluto would crash
together again well it was certain that
none of its inimical life would survive that
crash

  hi lay gasping on the floor of the kiosk
he wondered numbly why none of the
guards came until he realized that they
too were distressed by the lack of air then
he saw something bending over him-some-
thing monstrous but he could not focus
his bloodshot eyes slim strong hands
grasped him he realized that the mon-
strous thing was someone in a space suit

the airlock of the aegeida

passed not seeming to notice them other

bilks seized the figure in the space suit by
the ankle and attempted to trip it but his
hand slipped and he lay there chest heav-

  hi was conscious of being pulled into the
airlock of the dull thud of a closing door
of a rush of glorious air after a few min-
utes he was able to sit up the bloody

saw that  his rescuer was cinda mara as

  that fellow bilks- she tried to hide

foreword

we had been friends
for a decade or more
and i knew giles angarth
as well as anyone could purport to know
him yet the thing was no less a mystery
to me than to others at the time and it is
still a mystery

  sometimes i think
that he and ebbonly
had designed it all be-
tween them as a huge
insoluble hoax that
they are still alive
somewhere and are
laughing at the world
that has been so sorely
baffled by their disap-
pearance and some-
times i make tentative
plans to re-visit crater
ridge and find if i can
the two boulders men-
tioned in angarths
narrative as having a
vague resemblance to
broken-down columns

  in the meantime no
one has uncovered any
trace of the missing
men or has heard even
t h e faintest rumor
concerning them and
the whole affair it
would seem is likely
to remain a most sing-
ular and exasperating
riddle

  angarth whose fame
as a writer of fantastic
fiction will probably
outlive that of most
other modern maga-
zine contributors had been spending the
summer among the sierras and had been
living alone till the artist felix ebbonly
vent to visit him ebbonly whom i had
never met was well known for his imagina-
tive paintings and drawings and he had
illustrated more than one of angarths nov-

            els when neighboring
campers became alarmed
over the prolonged absence
of the two men and the cab-
in was searched for some possible clue a
package addressed to me was found lying
on the table and i received it in due course
of time after reading many newspaper
speculations regarding
the double vanishment
the package contained
a small leather-bound
notebook angarth
had written on the fly-
leaf

                       dear hastane

                      you can publish
                    this journal some-
                    timey if you like
                    people will think it
                    the last and wildest
                    of all my fictions-
                    unless they take it
                    for one of your own
                    in either case it will
                    be just as well
                    good-bye

                            faithfully

                            giles angarth
                     i am now publish-
                     ing the journal which
                     will doubtless meet the
                     reception he predict-
                     ed but i am not so
                     certain myself as to
                     whether the tale is
                     truth or fabrication
                     the only way to make
                     sure will be to locate
                     the two boulders and
                     anyone who has ever
                     seen crater ridge and

wonder stories

my uneventful mode of existence in which
there has seldom been anything to chronicle
but the thing which happened this morn-
ing is so extravagantly strange so remote
from mundane laws and parallels that i feel
impelled to write it down to the best of
my understanding and ability also i shall
keep an account of the possible repetition
and continuation of my experience it will
be perfectly safe to do this for no one who
ever reads the record will be likely to be-
lieve it

  i had gone for a walk on crater ridge
which lies a mile or less to the north of my
cabin near summit though differing
markedly in its character from the usual
landscapes roundabout
it is one of my favorite
places it is exceptional-
ly bare and desolate with
little more in the way of
vegetation than mountain
sun-flowers wild currant-
bushes and a few sturdy
wind-warped pines and
supple tamaracks

  geologists deny it a
volcanic origin yet its
outcroppings of rough
nodular stone and enor-
mous rubble-heaps have
all the air of scoriac re-
mains-at least to my
non-scientific eye they
look like the slag and
refuse of cyclopean fur-
naces poured out in pre-human years to
cool and harden into shapes of limitless
grotesquery

  among them are stones that suggest the
fragments of primordial bas-reliefs or
small pre-historic idols and figurines and
others that seem to have been graven with
lost letters of an indecipherable script un-
expectedly there is a little tarn lying on one
end of the long dry ridge-a tarn that
has never been fathomed the hill is an
odd interlude among the granite sheets and
crags and the fir-clothed ravines and val-
leys of this region

  it was a clear windless morning and i
paused often to view the magnificent per-

spectives of varied scenery that were visible
on every hand-the titan battlements of
castle peak the rude masses of donner
peak with its dividing pass of hemlocks
the remote luminous blue of the nevada
mountains and the soft green of willows
in the valley at my feet it was an aloof
silent world and i heard no sound other
than the dry crackling noise of cicadas
among the currant-bushes

  i strolled on in a zig-zag manner for some
distance and coming to one of the rubble-
fields with which the ridge is interstrewn
i began to search the ground closely hop-
ing to find a stone that was sufficiently
quaint and grotesque in its form to be worth
keeping as a curiosity i
had found several such in
my previous wanderings

  suddenly i came to a
clear space amid the rub-
ble in which nothing
grew-a space that was
round as an artificial
ring in the center were
two isolated boulders
queerly alike in shape
and lying about five feet
apart i paused to ex-
amine them their sub-
stance a dull greenish-
grey stone seemed to be
different from anything
else in the neighborhood
and i conceived at once
the weird unwarrantable
fancy that they might be the pedestals of
vanished columns worn away by incalcul-
able years till there remained only these
sunken ends

  certainly the perfect roundness and uni-
formity of the boulders was peculiar and
though i possess a smattering of geology
i could not identify their smooth soapy
material

  my imagination was excited and i began
to indulge in some rather overheated fan-
tasies but the wildest of these was a home-
ly commonplace in comparison with the
thing that happened when i took a single
step forward in the vacant space immediate-
ly between the two boulders i shall try

                     a-

clark ashton smith
the city of singing flame



to describe it to the utmost of my verbal
ability though human language is natural-
ly wanting in words that are adequate for
the delineation of events and sensations be-
yond the normal scope of human experi-
ence

  nothing is more disconcerting than to
miscalculate the degree of descent in taking
a step imagine then what it was like to
step forward on level open ground and
fiiid utter nothingness underfoot i seemed
to be going down into an empty gulf and
at the same time the landscape before me
vanished in a swirl of broken images and
everything went blind there was a feeling
of intense hyperborean cold and an inde-
scribable sickness and vertigo possessed me
due no doubt to the profound disturbance
of equilibrium also-either from the
speed of my descent or for some other
reason-i was totally unable to draw
breath

  my thoughts and feelings were unutter-
ably confused and half the time it seemed
to me that i was falling upward rather than
downward or was sliding horizontally or
at some oblique angle at last i had the
sensation of turning a complete somersault
ard then i found myself standing erect on
solid ground once more without the least
shock or jar of impact the darkness clear-
ed away from my vision but i was still
dizzy and the optical images i received
were altogether meaningless for some mo-
ments

a plunge into nothingness

wfen finally i recovered the power of

cognizance and was able to view my
surroundings with a measure of perception
i experienced a mental confusion equivalent
to that of a man who might find himself
cast without warning on the shore of some
fcreign planet there was the same sense
of utter loss and alienation which would
assuredly be felt in such a case-the same
vertiginous overwhelming bewilderment
the same ghastly sense of separation from
all the familiar environmental details that
give color and form and definition to our

lives and even determine our very personal-
ities

  i was standing in the midst of a land-
scape which bore no degree or manner of
resemblance to crater ridge a long grad-
ual slope covered with violet grass and
studded at intervals with stones of mono-
lithic size and shape ran undulantly away
beneath me to a broad plain with sinuous
open meadows and high stately forests of
an unknown vegetation whose pre-dominant
hues were purple and yellow the plain
seemed to end in a wall of impenetrable
golden-brownish mist that rose with phan-
tom pinnacles to dissolve on a sky of lum-
inescent amber in which there was no sun

  in the foreground of this amazing scene
not more than two or three miles away
there loomed a city whose massive towers
and mountainous ramparts of red stone
were such as the anakim of undiscovered
worlds might build wall on beetling wall
and spire on giant spire it soared to con-
front the heavens maintaining everywhere
the severe and solemn lines of a rectilinear
architecture it seemed to overwhelm and
crush down the beholder with its stern and
crag-like imminence

  as i viewed this city i forgot my initial
sense of bewildering loss and alienage in
an awe with which something of actual ter-
ror was mingled and at the same time i
felt an obscure but profound allurement
the cryptic emanation of some enslaving
spell but after i had gazed awhile the
cosmic strangeness and bafflement of my
unthinkable position returned upon me and
i felt only a wild desire to escape from the
maddeningly oppressive bizarrerie of this
region and regain my own world in an
effort to fight down my agitation i tried
tv figure out if possible what had really
happened

  i had read a number of trans-dimensional
stories-in fact i had written one or two
myself and i had often pondered the pos-
sibility of other worlds or material planes
which may co-exist in the same space with
ours invisible and impalpable to human
senses of course i realized at once that
i had fallen into some such dimension
doubtless when i took that step forward


wonder stories

between the boulders i had been precipi-
tated into some sort of flaw or fissure in
space to emerge at the bottom in this alien
sphere-in a totally different kind of space
it sounded simple enough in a way-but
not simple enough to make the modus oper-
andi anything but a brain-racking mystery

  in a further effort to collect myself i
studied my immediate surroundings with a
close attention this time i wras impressed
by the arrangement of the monolithic stones
i have spoken of many of which were dis-
posed at fairly regular intervals in two
parallel lines running down the hill as if
to mark the course of some ancient road
obliterated by the purple grass

  turning to follow its ascent i saw right
behind me two columns standing at pre-
cisely the same distance apart as the two
odd boulders on crater ridge and formed
of the same soapy greenish-gray stone the
pillars were perhaps nine feet high and
had been taller at one time since the tops
were splintered and broken away not far
above them the mounting slope vanished
from view in a great bank of the same gol-
den-brown mist that enveloped the remoter
plain but there were no more monoliths
-and it seemed as if the road had ended
with those pillars

  inevitably i began to speculate as to the
relationship between the columns in this
new dimension and the boulders in my own
world surely the resemblance could not
be a matter of mere chance if i stepped
between the columns could i return to the
human sphere by a reversal of my precipi-
tation therefrom and if so by what in-
conceivable beings from foreign time and
space had the columns and boulders been
established as the portals of a gateway be-
tween two worlds who could have used
the gateway and for what purpose

  my brain reeled before the infinite vistas
of surmise that were opened by such ques-
tions

however what concerned me most
was the problem of getting back to
crater ridge the weirdness of it all the
monstrous walls of the nearby town the un-
natural hues and forms of the outlandish

scenery were too much for human nerves
and i felt that i should go mad if forced
to remain long in such a milieu also
there wa no telling what hostile powers or
entities i might encounter if i stayed

  the slope and plain were devoid of ani-
mate life as far as i could see but the
great city was presumptive proof of its ex-
istence unlike the heroes in my own tales
who were wont to visit the fifth dimension or
the worlds of algol with perfect sang-froid
i did not feel in the least adventurous and
i shrank back with mans instinctive recoil
before the unknown with one fearful
glance at the looming city and the wide
plain with its lofty gorgeous vegetation
i turned and stepped back between the col-
umns

  there was the same instantaneous plunge
into blind and freezing gulfs the same inde-
terminate falling and twisting that had
marked my descent into this new dimension
at the end i found myself standing very
dizzy and shaken on the same spot from
which i had taken my forward step between
the greenish-grey boulders crater ridge
was swirling and reeling about me as if in
the throes of earthquake and i had to sit
down for a minute or two before i could
recover my equilibrium

  i came back to the cabin like a man in a
dream the experience seemed and still
seems incredible and unreal and yet it
has overshadowed everything else and has
colored and dominated all my thoughts per-
haps by writing it down i can shake it off
a little it has unsettled me more than any
previous experience in my whole life and
the world about me seems hardly less im-
probable and nightmarish than the one that
i have penetrated in a fashion so fortuitous

  aug nd i have done a lot of think-
ing in the past few days-and the more i
ponder and puzzle the more mysterious it
all becomes granting the flaw in space
which must be an absolute vacuum imperv-
ious to air ether light and matter how was
it possible for me to fall into it and
having fallen in how could i fall out-par-
ticularly into a sphere that has no certi-
fiable relationship with ours

  but after all one process would be as
the city of singing flame



easy as the other in theory the main ob-
jection is how could one move in a vacuum
either up or down or backward or for-
ward the whole thing would baffle the
comprehension of an einstein and i do not
feel that i have even approached the true
sclution

  also i have been fighting the temptation
to go back if only to convince myself that
the thing really occurred but after all
why shouldnt i go back an opportunity
has been vouchsafed to me such as no man
may ever have been given before and the
wonders i shall see and the secrets i shall
learn are beyond imagining my nervous
trepidation is inexcusably childish under the
circumstances

  aug rd i went back this morning
armed with a revolver somehow with-
out thinking that it might make a difference
i did not step in the very middle of the
space between the boulders undoubtedly
as a result of this my descent was more pro-
longed and impetuous than before and
seemed to consist mainly of a series of
spiral somersaults it must have taken me
minutes to recover from the ensuing ver-
tigo and when i came to i was lying on
the violet grass

  this time i went boldly down the slope
and keeping as much as i could in the shel-
ter of that bizarre purple and yellow vege-
tation i stole toward the looming city all
was very still and there was no breath of
wind in those exotic trees which appeared
to imitate in their lofty upright boles and
horizontal foliage the severe architectural
lines of the cyclopean buildings

  i had not gone far when i came to a road
iv the forest-a road paved with stupendous
blocks of stone at least twenty feet square
it ran toward the city i thought for awhile
that it was wholly deserted-perhaps dis-
used and i even dared to walk upon it till
i heard a noise behind me and turning saw
the approach of several singular entities
terrified i sprang back and hid myself in
a thicket from which i watched the passing
of those creatures wondering fearfully if
they had seen me apparently my fears
vere groundless for they did not even
glance at my hiding-place

  it is hard for me to describe or even
visualize them now for they were totally
unlike anything that we are accustomed to
think of as human or animal they must
have been ten feet tall and they were mov-
ing along with colossal strides that took
them from sight in a few instants beyond a
turn of the road their bodies were bright
and shining as if encased in some sort of
armor and their heads were equipped with
high curving appendages of opalescent
hues which nodded above them like fan-
tastic plumes but may have been antennae
or other sense-organs of a novel type

  trembling with excitement and wonder
i continued my progress through the richly-
colored undergrowth as i went on i per-
ceived for the first time that there were no
shadows anywhere the light came from all
portions of the sunless amber heaven per-
vading everything with a soft uniform
luminosity

  all was motionless and silent as i have
said before and there was no evidence of
bird insect or animal life in all this pre-
ternatural landscape but when i had ad-
vanced to within a mile of the city as well
as i could judge the distance in a realm
where the very proportions of objects were
unfamiliar i became aware of something
which at first was recognizable as a vibra-
tion rather than a sound

  there was a queer thrilling in my nerves
the disquieting sense of some unknown
force or emanation flowing through my
body this was perceptible for some time
before i heard the music but having heard
it my auditory nerves identified it at once
with the vibration

  it was faint and far-off and seemed to
emanate from the very heart of the titan
city the melody was piercingly sweet
and resembled at times the singing of some
voluptuous feminine voice however no
human voice could have possessed the un-
earthly pitch the shrill perpetually sus-
tained notes that somehow suggested the
light of remote worlds and stars translated
into sound

  ordinarily i am not very sensitive to
music i have even been reproached for not
reacting more strongly to it but i had


wonder stories

not gone much further when i realized the
peculiar mental and emotional spell which
the far-off sound was beginning to exert
upon me there was a siren-like allurement
which drew me on forgetful of the strange-
ness and potential perils of my situation
and i felt a slow drug-like intoxication of
brain and senses in some insidious man-
ner i know not how nor why the music
conveyed the ideas of vast but attainable
space and altitude of superhuman freedom
and exultation and it seemed to promise
all the impossible splendors of which my
imagination has vaguely dreamt

an amazing world

the forest continued almost to the city
walls peering from behind the final
boscage i saw their overwhelming battle-
ments in the sky above me and noted the
flawless jointure of their prodigious blocks
i was near the great road which entered an
open gate that was large enough to admit
the passage of behemoths there were no
guards in sight and several more of the
tall gleaming entities came striding along
and went in as i watched from where i
stood i was unable to see inside the gate
for the wall was stupendously thick the
music poured from that mysterious entrance
in an ever-strengthening flood and sought
l draw me on with its weird seduction
eager for unimaginable things

  it was hard to resist hard to rally my
will-power and turn back i tried to con-
centrate on the thought of danger-but the
thought was tenuously unreal at least i
tore myself away and retraced my footsteps
very slowly and lingeringly till i was be-
yond reach of the music even then the
spell persisted like the effects of a drug
and all the way home i was tempted to re-
turn and follow those shining giants into
the city

  aug th i have visited the new dimen-
sion once more i thought i could resist
that summoning music and i even took
some cotton-wadding along with which to
stuff my ears if it should affect me too
strongly i began to hear the supernal mel-
ody at the same distance as before and was

drawn onward in the same manner but
this time i entered the open gate

  i wonder if i can describe that city i
felt like a crawling ant upon its mammoth
pavements amid the measureless babel of
its buildings of its streets and arcades
everywhere there were columns obelisks
and the perpendicular pylons of fane-like
structures that would have dwarfed those
of thebes and heliopolis

  and the people of the city how is one
to depict them or give them a name i
think that the gleaming entities i first saw
are not the true inhabitants but are only
visitors-perhaps from some other world
of dimension like myself the real peo-
ple are giants too but they move slowly
with solemn hieratic paces their bodies
are nude and swart and their limbs are those
of caryatides-massive enough it would
seem to uphold the roofs and lintels of their
own buildings i fear to describe them
minutely for human words would give the
idea of something monstrous and uncouth
and these beings are not monstrous but
have merely developed in obedience to the
laws of another evolution than ours the en-
vironmental forces and conditions of a dif-
ferent world

  somehow i was not afraid when i saw
them-perhaps the music had drugged me
till i was beyond fear there was a group
of them just inside the gate and they
seemed to pay me no attention whatever as
i passed them the opaque jet-like orbs
of their huge eyes were impassive as the
carven eyes of andro-sphinxes nd they
uttered no sound from their heavy straight
expressionless lips perhaps they lack the
sense of hearing for their strange semi-
rectangular heads were devoid of anything
in the nature of external ears

  i followed the music which was still re-
mote and seemed to increase little in loud-
ness i was soon overtaken by several of
those beings whom i had previously seen
on the road outside the walls and they
passed me quickly and disappeared in the
labyrinth of buildings after them there
came other beings of a less gigantic kind
and without the bright shards or armor
worn by the first-comers then overhead
the city of singing flame



two creatures with long translucent blood-
colored wings intricately veined and ribbed
came flying side by side and vanished be-
hind the others their faces featured with
organs of unsurmisable use were not those
of animals and i felt sure that they were
beings of a high orders of development

  i saw hundreds of those slow-moving
somber entities whom i have identified as
the true inhabitants none of them ap-
peared to notice me doubtless they were
accustomed to seeing far weirder and more
unusual kinds of life than humanity as
i went on i was overtaken by dozens of
improbable-looking creatures all going in
the same direction as myself as if drawn
by the same siren melody

deeper and deeper i went into the
wilderness of colossal architecture led
by that remote ethereal opiate music i
soon noticed a sort of gradual ebb and
flow in the sound occupying an interval
of ten minutes or more but by impercept-
ible degrees it grew sweeter and nearer i
wondered how it could penetrate that man-
ifold maze of builded stone and be heard
outside the walls

  i must have walked for miles in the
ceaseless gloom of those rectangular struc-
ture that hung above me tier on tier at an
awful height in the amber zenith then at
length i came to the core and secret of it
all preceded and followed by a number of
those chimerical entities i emerged on a
great square in whose center was a temple-
like building more immense than the others
the music poured imperiously shrill and
loud from its many-columned entrance

  i felt the thrill of one who approaches
the sanctum of some hierarchal mystery
when i entered the halls of that building
people who must have come from many
different worlds or dimensions went with
me and before me along the titanic colon-
nades whose pillars were graven with in-
decipherable runes and enigmatic bas-
reliefs

  also the dark colossal inhabitants of
the town were standing or roaming about
intent like all the others on their own af-
fairs none of these beings spoke either

to me or to one another and though sev-
eral eyed me casually my presence was evi-
dently taken for granted

  there are no words to convey the incom-
prehensible wonder of it ail and the
music i have utterly failed to describe
that also it was as if some marvellous
elixir had been turned into sound-waves-
an elixir conferring the gift of superhuman
life and the high magnificent dreams
which are dreamt by the immortals it
mounted in my brain like a supernal drun-
kenness as i approached the hidden source

  i do not know what obscure warning
prompted me now to stuff my ears with
cotton before i went any further though
j could still hear it still feel its peculiar
penetrant vibration the sound became mut-
ed when i had done this and its influence
was less powerful henceforward there is
little doubt that i owe my life to this sim-
ple and homely precaution

  the endless rows of columns grew dim
for awhile as the interior of a long basaltic
cavern and then at some distance ahead i
perceived the glimmering of a soft light on
the floor and pillars the light soon be-
came an overflooding radiance as if gi-
gantic lamps were being lit in the temples
heart and the vibrations of the hidden
music pulsed more strongly in my nerves

  the hall ended in a chamber of immense
indefinite scope whose walls and roof were
doubtful with unremoving shadows in the
center amid the pavement of mammoth
blocks there was a circular pit above which
there seemed to float a fountain of flame
that soared in one perpetual slowly length-
ening jet this flame was the sole illumin-
ation  and also it was the source of the wild
unearthly music even with my purposely
deafened ears i was wooed by the shrill
and starry sweetness of its singing and i
felt the voluptuous lure and the high verti-
ginous exaltation

  i knew immediately that the place was a
shrine and that the trans-dimensional beings
who accompanied me were visiting pilgrims
there were scores of them-perhaps hun-
dreds but all were dwarfed in the cosmic
immensity of that chamber they were
gathered before the flame in various attitudes


wonder stories

of worship they bowed their exotic heads
or made mysterious gestures of adoration
with unhuman hands and members and the
voices of several deep as booming drums
or sharp as the stridulation of giant insects
were audible amid the singing of the foun-
tain

  spell-bound i went forward and poined
them enthralled by the music and by the
vision of the soaring flame i paid as little
heed to my outlandish companions as they
to me

  the fountain rose and rose till its light
flickered on the limbs and features of thron-
ed colossal statues behind it-of heroes or
gods or demons from the earlier cycles of
alien time staring in stone from a dusk of
illimitable mystery the fire was green and
dazzling it was pure as the central flame
of a star it blinded me and when i turned
my eyes away the air was filled with webs
of intricate color with swiftly changing
arabesques whose numberless unwonted
hues and patterns were such as no mundane
eye had ever beheld i felt a stimulating
warmth that filled my very marrow with
intenser life

the lure of the flame

the music mounted with the flame
and i understood now its recurrent ebb
and flow as i looked and listened a mad
thought was born in my mind-the thought
of how marvellous and ecstatical it would
be to run forward and leap headlong into
the singing fire the music seemed to tell
me that i should find in that moment of
flaring dissolution all the delight and tri-
umph all the splendor and exaltation it
had promised from afar it besought me
it pleaded with tones of supernal melody
and despite the wadding in my ears the
seduction was well-nigh irresistible

  however it had not robbed me of all
sanity with a sudden start of terror like
one who has been tempted to fling himself
from a high precipice i drew back then
i saw that the same dreadful impulse was
shared by some of my companions the
two entities with scarlet wings whom i
have previously mentioned were standing

a little apart from the rest of us now with
a great fluttering they rose and flew to-
ward the flame like moths toward a can-
dle for a brief moment the light shone
redly through their half-transparent wings
ere they disappeared in the leaping incan-
descence which flared briefly and then
burned as before

  then in rapid succession a number of
other beings who represented the most di-
vergent trends of biology sprang forward
and immolated themselves in the flame
there were creatures with translucent bod-
ies and some that shone with all the hues
of the opal there were winged colossi and
titans who strode as with seven-league
boots and there was one being with use-
less abortive wings who crawled rather than
ran to seek the same glorious doom as the
rest but among them there were none of
the citys people these merely stood and
looked on impassive and statue-like as
ever

  i saw that the fountain had now reached
it greatest height and was beginning to
decline it sank steadily but slowly to half
it former elevation during this interval
there were no more acts of self-sacrifice
and several of the beings beside me turned
abruptly and went away as if they had
overcome the lethal spell

  one of the tall armored entities as he
left addressed me in words that were like
clarion-notes with unmistakable accents
of warning by a mighty effort of will
in a turmoil of conflicting emotions i fol-
lowed him at every step the madness and
delirium of the music warred with my in-
stincts of self-preservation more than once
i started to go back my homeward jour-
ney was blurred and doubtful as the wan-
derings of a man in an opium-trance and
the music sang behind me and told me of
the rapture i had missed of the flaming
dissolution whose brief instant was better
than aeons of mortal life

  aug th i have tried to go on with a
new story but have made no progress any-
thing that i can imagine or frame in lan-
guage seems flat and puerile beside the
world of unsearchable mystery to which i
have found admission the temptation to
the city of singing flame	

return is more cogent than ever the call
of that remembered music is sweeter than
the voice of a loved woman and aiways
i am tormented by the problem of it all
and tantalized by the little which i have
perceived and understood what forces are
these whose existence and working i have
merely apprehended who are the inhab-
itants of the city and who are the beings
that visit the enshrined flame what ru-
mor or legend has drawn them from out-
land realms and ulterior planets to that
place of blissful danger and destruction
and what is the fountain itself and what
the secret of its lure and its deadly singing
these problems admit of infinite surmise
but no conceivable solution

  i am planning to go back once more-
but not alone someone must go with me
this time as a witness to the wonder and
the peril it is all too strange for credence
-i must have human corroboration of what
i have seen and felt and conjectured also
another might understand where i have
failed to do more than apprehend

  who shall i take it will be necessary
to invite someone here from the outer
world-someone of high intellectual and
aesthetic capacity shall i ask philip
hastane my fellow fiction-writer hastane
would be too busy i fear but there is the
californian artist felix ebbonly who has
illustrated some of my fantastic novels

  ebbonly would be the man to see and
appreciate the new dimension if he can
come with his bent for the bizarre and
the unearthly the spectacle of that plain
and city the babelian buildings and ar-
cades and the temple of the flame will
simply enthrall him i shall write immed-
iately to his san francisco address

  aug th ebbonly is here-the myster-
ious hints in my letter regarding some novel
pictorial subjects along his own line were
too provocative ior him to resist now i
have explained full and have given him a
detailed account of my adventures i can
see that he is a little incredulous for which
i hardly blame him but he will not re-
main incredulous very long for tomorrow
we shall visit together the city of the sing-
ing flame

  aug th i must concentrate my disor-
dered faculties i must choose my words
and write with exceeding care this will
be the last entry in my journal and the
last writing i shall ever do when i have
finished i shall wrap the journal up and
address it to philip hastane who can make
such disposition of it as he sees fit

  i took ebbonly into the other dimension
today he was impressed even as i had
been by the two isolated boulders on crater
ridge

   they look like the guttered ends of col-
umns established by pre-human gods he
remarked i begin to believe you now

   i told him to go first and indicated the
 place where he should step he obeyed
without hesitation and i had the singular
experience of seeing a man melt into utter
instantaneous nothingness one moment he
was there-and the next there was only
bare ground and the far-off tamaracks whose
view his body had obstructed i followed
and found him standing in speechless awe
on the violet grass

   this he said at last is the sort of
thing whose existence i have hitherto mere-
ly suspected and have never even been able
to hint in my most imaginative drawings

we spoke little as we followed the
range of monolithic boulders toward
the plain far in the distance beyond those
high and stately trees with their sumptuous
foliage the golden-brown vapors had part-
ed showing vistas of an immense horizon
and past the horizon were range on range of
gleaming orbs and fiery flying motes in
the depth of that amber heaven it was as
if the veil of another universe than ours had
been drawn back

   we crossed the plain and came at length
within ear-shot of the siren music i warned
ebbonly to stuff his ears with cotton-wad-
ding but he refused

  i dont want to deaden any new sensa-
tions which i may experience he observ-
ed

  we entered the city my companion was
in a veritable rhapsody of artistic delight
when he beheld the enormous buildings and
the people i could see too that the music


wonder stories

had taken hold upon him his look soon
became fixed and dreamy as that of an
opium-eater at first he made many com-
ments on the architecture and the various
beings who passed us and called my atten-
tion to details which i had not perceived
heretofore

  however as we drew nearer to the tem-
ple of the flame his observational interest
seemed to flag and was replaced by more
and more of an ecstatic inward absorption
his remarks became fewer and briefer and
he did not even seem to hear my questions
it was evident that the sound had wholly
bemused and bewitched him

  even as on my former visit there were
many pilgrims going toward the shrine--
ard few that were coming away from it
most of them belonged to evolutionary types
that i had seen before among those that
were new to me i recall one gorgeous crea-
ture with golden and cerulean wings like
those of a giant lepidopter and scintillating
jcwel-like eyes that must have been de-
signed to mirror the glories of some edenic
world

  i too felt as before the captious tlirall-
dom and bewitchment the insidious grad-
ual perversion of thought and instinct as
if the music were working in my brain like
a subtle alkaloid since i had taken my
usual precaution my subjection to the in-
fluence was less complete than that of eb-
bonly but nevertheless it was enough to
make me forget a number of things -
among them the initial concern which i
had felt when my companion refused to
employ the same mode of protection as
myself i no longer thought of his danger
or my own except as something very dis-
tant and immaterial

  the streets were like the prolonged and
bewildering labyrinth of a nightmare but
the music led us forthrightly and always
there were other pilgrims like men in the
giip of some powerful current we were
drawn to our destination

  as we passed along the hall of gigantic
columns and neared the abode of the fiery
fountain a sense of our peril quickened
momentarily in my brain and i sought to
warn ebbonly once more but all my pro-

tests and remonstrances were futile he was
deaf as a machine and wholly impervious
to anything but the lethal music his ex-
pression and his movements were those of
a somnambulist even when i seized and
shook him with such violence as i could
muster he remained oblivious of my pre-
sence

  the throng of worshippers was larger
than upon my first visit the jet of pure
incandescent flame was mounting steadily
as we entered and it sang with the pure
aidor and ecstacy of a star alone in space
again with ineffable tones it told me the
rapture of a moth-like death in its lofty
soaring the exultation and triumph of a
momentary union with its elemental essence

  the flame rose to its apex and even for
me the mesmeric lure was well-night irre-
sistible many of our companions suc-
cumbed and the first to immolate himself
was the giant lepidopterous being four
others of diverse evolutional types follow-
ed in appallingly swift succession

  in my own partial subjection to the music
my own effort to resist that deadly enslave-
ment i had almost forgotten the very pre-
sence of ebbonly it was too late for me to
even think of stopping him when he ran
forward in a series of leaps that were both
solemn and frenzied like the beginning of
some sacerdotal dance and hurled himself
headlong into the flame the fire envel-
oped him it flared up for an instant with
a more dazzling greenness and that was
all

  slowly as if from benumbed brain-cen-
ters a horror crept upon my conscious mind
and helped to annul the perilous mesmer-
ism i turned while many others were fol-
lowing ebbonlys example and fled from
the shrine and from the city but somehow
the horror diminished as i went and more
and more i found myself envying my com-
panions fate and wondering as to the sen-
sations he had felt in that moment of fiery
dissolution 

  now as i write this i am wondering why
i came back again to the human world
words are futile to express what i have be-
held and experienced and the change that
has come upon me beneath the play of in-
wonder stories



calculable forces in a world of which no
other mortal is even cognizant

  literature is nothing more than the shad-
ow and life with its drawn-out length of
monotonous reiterative days is unreal and
without meaning now in comparison with
the splendid death which i might have had

-the glorious doom which is still in store
t have no longer any will to fight the ever-
insistent music which i hear in memory
and-there seems to be no reason at all why
i should fight it out tomorrow i shall re-
turn to the city

wonder stories

time-locked doors a single man of earth
sits brooding-remembering

  he is a man of brute force and quick pas-
sion-black-browed shaggy-maned adher-
ing to the matted beard that like him has
long been outlawed by the races of the inner
planets in the days of the first space-lines
he had been master of a grfeat new ship had
betrayed it and fled from port to port of
space leaving death and disorder in his
wake

  and now he sits and thinks-of venus
and a woman in the gardens of laxa be-
neath the very eyes of the royal guards he
thinks of earth and long weeks of stealthy
flight and cold terror in the lawless shad-
owland of the lower lev-
els and of those other
rabbit-warrens of dimly
luminous corridors deep
in the bowels of the
moon where little fear-
ful bands of hunted crea-
tures fought and fed
bred and died among
slimy things that dripped
light and of desert mars
with its great lanes of
green and its cities of low
red rock buried at the
hubs whence the great riv-
ers of vegetation rise and
trickle out into the red
wastes of wind-tossed
sand he thinks of mars
and capture

  in his mind it all lives again a crimson
shadow in a crimson land he slips like a
wraith through deserted streets clinging
close to the low walls starting in terror from
open windows the rich red blood of earth
on his hands and his face and its warm
sweet-salt taste in his mouth blood of him
who had thought him a weakling and whom
he had broken like a twig in his two hands
then from a shadowed doorway a cloaked
figure steps turns with a moments answered
twitter to someone hidden in the shadow
wheels with a flare of black and scarlet-
an officer of the martian police

  no time no thought for flight he leaps
stoops beneath the startled flurry of sword

and ray-pistol drives straight forward with
his mighty fist-like a thunderbolt strikes
the blank white space between those gog-
gling eyes

  pagh like the shell of an egg the thing
breaks with a little taut pop and plash of
brain as his fist bursts through slimy and
hot squirming brain-stuff fouling his open-
ed palm for a long instant he struggles
to free his hand from the paper-thin skull
that clutches at his wrist and drags withthe
full weight of a falling body at his wounded
arm then he is free the pale green blood
of the martian dripping thinly from hand
and arm-watery stuff not strong and hot
like the crimson blood of earth

it is an instant too long
a yammering shriek of
rage and frenzied hate
shatters the shielding
silence bright stabbing
light splits the shadow
blinding him dumbly he
clutches at his head
where an ear has been
seared to a twisted cinder
stands for an instant
then ducks and drives at
the twittering form that
hurtles from the shadow
of the doorway-that
damned martians wo-
man

  with his wounded right
arm he strikes up the ray-
gun that again turns night to day with
his left he strikes out straight from the
shoulder with a blow that his mighty earth-
born muscles give the power of a lightning-
stroke the twitter dies in a gurgling gasp
there is a brittle snap of ribs as a soft bulg-
ing chest caves under his great fist and now
his right drives again and again an egg-
shell skull shatters and pale-green brain-
stuff flows slowly down over blank gog-
gling eyes

  a moment he stays to seize the ray-guns
and the short-sword then melts into the
darkness as the street wakes into a fright-
ened clamor of timorous twittering and the
flare of ray-bursts a few hurried seconds

the red spot of jupiter



of a hurried life-but the hell-cat of a mar-
tian girl has marked him

  they caught him that very night as he
slunk in the shadows that fled before the
racing martian moon that darted through the
heavens two fell before his fists after they
had exploded his pistols in his hands and
fused his sword by his side but in the
flurry of soft bodies a keen needle jabbed
once and again and his strength flowed out
into the red shadows

  martians do not kill a criminal-oh no-
they cure him but the girl had been the
daughter of a high police official-damned
jade messing about in the dark with young
police officers-and he was a man not un-
known or unwanted in other cities and on
other planets bad luck always came from
killing a martian his pal red had said
that many a time in the labyrinthine moon-
caves no truer word had the old outlaw
ever said-he could prove it-his first mar-
tian and his first capture since the old days
when he was just a green scared kid knifing
a man for his scrip in the fifth level of old
new york

  hed always been lucky-and now they
were sending him to jupiter to the little in-
nermost moon to take his place with those
marooned bestial outcasts of three planets
whose luck had fallen down on them when
they needed it haw luck gullivers
luck they called it-his luck-in every rat-
hole and fox-den of the solar system wher-
ever his name was known and now it had
slipped out on him like it always did when
a guy killed a martian

  gullivers luck funny the guard had
slipped him a couple of books kids books
down the food-tube nothing but a kid
himself that guard old books they were
and hard to read copied off in short-hand
on this new vellum from rotting volumes in
some library where the fragile pages of
collodion-covered yellow paper turned slow-
ly beneath their glass cases there were
pictures too old pictures that someone had
photographed and sneaked out-funny-
looking people and animals and such
alice in wonderland was one of them-
just a crazy kids book but kind of hard to
understand the other one was different

more the sort of thing lie could get hold of

-gullivers travels

  funny he was gulliver too and he sure
had traveled some-more than that old gul-
liver in the book hed had luck too gul-
livers luck what with giants and little pig-
my people and talking horses and those
other crazy scientists and those others with
the flying cities but nothing like what he
had seen and heard and been through here
in this old solar system what were talk-
ing horses against grown-up bugs like those
in the swamps of venus-bugs that go into
a fight like a regular army what were
these big space-ships but flying cities-fly-
ing further and faster than any of those in
the book and as for giants or things
like those little people-pshaw think
they could do him in like they did that old
gulliver in the book let em try it still
and all he was a good man in a scrape book
or no book that old guy he was a gulli-
ver and he had gullivers luck

  so his thoughts ran as the huge liner
throbbed its course among the stars-
thoughts of his own rough life and of the
life of another gulliver of earth a man of
fantasy of fiction conceived by a master
satirist nearly thirteen centuries before his
birth

  sometimes he thought of that living tomb
ahead where he must fight for food and
shelter and life itself among the dregs of
three planets-hairy brutes like himself
from earth and the moon tall gods without
emotion from venus little fragile martians
that had run amuck under the strain of con-
ditions on other planets than their own
once only once police landed there to take
off a man who had been pardoned and it
was nip and tuck for a while hed been a
ship-master then in charge of a government
ship a real captain in the service of the
league

  sometimes he wondered why he ever gave
it all up and wrecked his ship for what he
could salvage he had been drunk and
sore too sore over some woman some wo-
man on venus-but that was long over and
hed had some good times and good hauls
since then plenty of them so here he was
cooped up in this leaden ray-proof room


wonder stories

waiting for them to take him off and drop
him on a space-island full of mad beasts
bet that never happened to the old gulliver
still he was a great old guy and you never
can tell what might have happened that he
didnt feel like putting in writing he
knew how it was and gullivers luck
wasnt new-not by a long shot

gullivers strategy

mars grew and blotted out the stars
an orange-red ball snow-capped and
penciled with wide lines and dots of grey-
green the mighty ship spawned in mid-
space and went its silent way a little plum-
met of polished metal dropping down past
the two wheeling moons of mars to the great
martian metropolis of kulal at the tip of the
syrtia major then all was tense and a
subdued thrill of excitement crept through
the silent throng that lined the observation
ports it never fails to thrill passengers
and even the crew and officers when a liner
passes through the belt of asteroids

  the ship had raised a little above the
plane of the ecliptic in order to pass well
above the main belt where the tiny pocket-
planets were thickest and most dangerous
many a man had died an awful death in
emptiness as his ship careened a shattered
hulk from a dark shape in the blackness
now below and on every side they were
showing as sunlight and light of the space-
ships great light-beams bathed them little
fainter dots of moving light against the
star-flecked heavens passengers and crew
alike clutched at the guard-straps for safety
a the ship lurched under the rattle of de-
flecting jets

  barely twenty miles away one of the
smaller asteroids swept by-in the binocu-
lars a dead waste of powdered pumice like
the moon men have been exiled here and
cast away by the misadventure of shipwreck
but none have told the tale clear from
mars to jupiter and beyond this belt of
scattered pigmy planets spread-stepping-
stones of the solar system

  many a man of the early explorers and
adventurers has laid his posts here in care-
fully charted orbits and then years or de-

cades later has worked his tedious way out
from rock to rock in space out toward jupi-
ter and the greater universe beyond but
now jets drum and rattle their message of
safety and the dancing specks of pale light
thin as a new form looms ahead in the
opening heavens-jupiter mightiest of the
planets

  now in the little lead room at the ships
heart a thin invisible vapor is hissing
through unseen openings and a sweet scent
of oblivion permeates the air the bearded
form sinks slowly in seeming sleep a
moment passes and then a second gas hisses
through pin-hole ducts and in the air a
faint white smoke forms and settles slowly
in fine dust over the quiet form

  the door recedes revealing walls of ten-
foot lead impervious to the ray-guns of res-
cuing or escaping criminals men come in
four of them bundled in unwieldly space-
suits that nearly treble their weight they
waddle to the sleeping prisoner push and
pull him into a suit like their own but lack-
ing the charge-belt and twin ray-pistols a
little flat-topped carriage on silent wheels
purrs into the room behind them the pri-
soner is lifted on it and they leave him and
vanish down the corridor

  after a long moment the still figure stirs
raises its head ever so slightly listening
it rolls from the carriage lands with a little
thud on its padded feet shuffles cunningly
into another room across the narrow cor-
ridor soon it returns thrusting a charge-
belt and pistols into the ampler pockets of
the suit climbs with difficulty upon the
little carriage and sinks again in feigned
sleep none too soon

  a bell rings harshly and like a phantom
the gleaming carriage speeds down the corri-
dor winds its way to the outer skin of the
ships hull where a sealed tube has opened
quickly its end rises tilting the still form
into the waiting air-lock which clicks shut
and seals automatically in the bow of the
ship a voice shouts echoing from corridor
to corridor over the loud-speakers from
the stern another answers there is a bare-
ly perceptible lurch a clang of scraping
metal and the great ship has spawned again
the red spot of jupiter



  in the single cabin of the tiny transport
four men gather round the controls and
peer into the darkness ahead regardless of
the still form on the berth behind them
they talk in the soft slurred words of the
thirty-first century-endings dropped rough
contractions used grammar of the classics
made subordinate to speed and universality
of expression their voices are muffled by
the padded insulation of the walls helmets
removed and hanging on their backs in the
safety of their ship

  titan first cap

  no well run him right through and
then go back to the post we dont have to
check this one through for inspection-hes
travelin cold-storage that is-unless we
have to refuel got enough of the stuff
just a minute till i look at the gauge
sure plenty six extra shells of astron an
a spare detonator ok with you cap
sure say fred what was that you
took from the guy there books give
em here a minute

  yeah i slipped em to him through the
food-tube-loose vellum no metal i
found em on a library smuggler last trip-
a trusty goin out to titan for a year or so
for sellin old books without a license
theyre kids books-real old ones that you
cant get near outside a library less you
have someone to bootleg you one i
thought he might like em bein there all to
himself no harm done fars i can see
oh no naturally not suppose there
was a poison-sheet in one of em-whered
we be now i ask you that

  not a chance cap i gave each page
the once-over an dipped it in his food
hes alive aint he besides how could
he get us after we doped him

         sure hes plenty alive but wait
vj till he hits that hell down there-
maybe thatll be another story still hes
plenty husky an i suppose most of em
either know him or have his rep there
cant be very many who dont know all
about black lem gulliver who cracked up
the titan for salvage on her first trip
say cap thats another funny thing
look here this is one of the books i let

him have-see gullivers travels fun-
ny aint it lemuel gulliver same as him
maybe theyre related huh

  maybe but you wont catch him brag-
gin about it any not if i know black lem
what time you got

  twenty-forty be there in an hour
goin to give him a knife or somethin fore
you drop him hell need it

  sure drop one in the cubby before you
put him in frank you go down in under
and get the gas-tanks attached we dont
want to drop him into that place asleep
and bill you crawl aft and put a couple of
those spare shells in the ways well need
them to get back then i can tip em in
when the time comes

  say cap

  whats the matter bill

  better watch your step this place is
pretty close to the limit an if you have to
use full power to get clear of jupiter we
may not make titan

  ill watch it up we cant risk that for
any crook alive hank you act dopey
poker last sleep-period

  yeah cap say thats some game for
an old-timer beats these new three-way
chess-sets for speed by a light-year an
it isnt a high-brow game like chess eith-
er

  oh sure i aint kickin-play it my-
self when i get a chance but it wont look
so good when we hit titan go on an
crawl into the bunk-that one up over him
ill wake you up when we get ready to dump
him if you want to see him sprawl and
swim

  ok cap thanks a lot

  all right with me hank

  for ten minutes twenty all is quiet be-
low in the cubby fred shuffles around at-
taching nozzles to the tanks of antidote for
the sleep-gas aft bill is wedged between
the jets muscling two heavy shells of astron
up into the rack that will tip them into the
firing-chambers when the time comes hank
is sprawled like a frog on his stomach in
the canvas bunk snoring the lights off to
cut down the reflection from the cabin cap
jockeys his firing lever meteors are pret-
ty thick for comfort near jupiter


wonder stories

  and now a tiny white disk swims out from
behind the shielding bulk of the great plan-
et and cap fairly glues himself to the con-
trols behind him a still form wakes into
quick stealthy life-the prisoner gulliver
on his back he bends a knee and thrustc
straight up for the sleeping man above with
all his great strength straight for his stom-
ach-a vulnerable spot in any race a sick
grunt and weak groan and it is all over

  cap wheels grabbing at his ray-gun a
flash of white flame and his hand becomes
a blackened stub-fingers seared by the
criminals ray again the ray blazes even
as he leaps-to crumple to the cabin-floor
with a horrible blackened burn in his thigh

  in the aft passage bill is hurrying for-
ward gun in hand below fred is creep-
ing toward the cabin hatch ready to drop
at the wink of an eye the grim bearded
figure in the cabin runs the controls to neu-
tral drives the unconscious captain halfway
to the cubby-hatch with a brutal kick then
crouches guns ready covering the door and
hatch a slender rod with polished tung-
sten electrode protrudes from the crack of
the door-bills ray-gun a flare of fire
and it droops fused and the hidden guard
is cursing with a seared finger a second
flash as fred drops again to the safety of
the cubby the heat of the ray turning the
metal hatch cherry-red

  gulliver speaks sneering arrogance and
brutal triumph in his voice

  listen you behind that door get out
of there before i melt the hinges an burn
you out

  bill stumbles out of his hiding gripping
the wrist of his wounded hand in white-
knuckled agony

  right now listen an you below me
i aint goin to be dropped not here any-
way i can run this ship by myself so i
dont need help nor hindrance from you big-
noses see im droppin you now you
have that knife you were goin to give me
an the feller in the cubby has his guns-
all right you can keep em i never give
a guy a dirty deal unless he gives me one-
not even a big-nose

  you there with the burned hand hust-
le your capn down that hatch he aint

dead just washed out by a little burn an
take that stiff in the bunk i aint afraid
of dead men but they aint nice company
for a lone man like me come on hustle
no stallin or ill drop you right out in
space there aint too much time an ive
got to find me a moon to hide on for a
while

  from the floor comes the voice of the
crippled captain you call yourself a
capn you damned fool look out of that
port behind you

  yah thats an old trick-an you with
a ray-gun left think im green any-
where

  stow it i had the controls set to curve
in to the moon didnt i an you threw
em neutral-a real capn like you go
ahead look out if you aint yellow wheres
the moon hey yeah an wheres jupiter
you poor fool youve killed us all an
youre in the same boat with the rest of us

the plunge to jupiter

fear seizing him gulliver wheels
stares for an instant turns back snarl-
ing there is no innermost moon to be
seen-in its stead huge jupiter blots out the
stars as the little ship rushes headlong into
its sea of frozen clouds whence no man has
returned and told the tale

  so thats the way it is huh we all die
together do we well mister big-nose if
any one of us four lives im elected see
get down that hatch before i ray you
quick i aint gabbin an if your damn
ship is any good af all im out of here see
if you have to stay ive seen a thing or
two in my day that most men have never
even heard of ive been here before see
an i aint dead yet nor aint goin to be

  alone in the cabin of the falling ship
fingering nervously the unfamiliar controls
the ex-captain stares from the broad port
trying their effect he hasnt run this kind
of ship doesnt know the ropes as he used
to still it would be easy-just try em all
gently an sort em out there-see
these are the jets here thats the cubby-
port thats the main port that must be the
lever to load the firing chambers cinch
the red spot of jupiter



if you know how all set now-its up to
luck to gullivers luck

  the great bulk of jupiter has blotted out
all the starry heavens with its huge ball of
swirling clouds banded by the equatorial
gales that circle the planet now easy with
the laterals easy and theyre in the atmos-
phere clouds of needle-crystals swirling all
about them mighty winds ripping and tear-
ing at every projection of the stream-lined
hull the ship flattening out in a long level
glide that will bring them spiraling out of
the blind greyness of the clouds down to
where he can see to navigate he has been
here before he knows his way about

  now the clouds drift up and the mightiest
of the planets lies far below the scudding
ship-desolation rampant crags deserts
great ranges and wind-carved time-worn
plateaus-all of the blue-green ice of the
outer planets ice that has lain hidden for
ages under the cloud-drift that men see
but it is not barren ice that he seeks but
another thing by far and as the rocket sinks
slowly he sees his goal rising above the
curve of the planet-the great red spot of
jupiter

  the ice has nearly all vanished and harsh
black rock juts in its stead in a chaotic
wilderness where no ship can land unwreck-
ed he is uneasy the controls are unfami-
liar do not respond as he would like he
is close to the crags now too close closer
than he has ever been he can see great
rivers torrents of ice and water flowing
in the heat of the spot the great mass
of the planet too is making itself felt and
he reacts to stimuli sluggishly but the
red spot is close now and the great updraft
of hot air that will hurl them above the
clouds to safety

  like a crimson mountain it looms ahead
and already great winds are sweeping them
into the maelstrom but it is hot and his
feet and hands feel heavy-it is hard to think
and act no he has never been so low--
he can see the region about the base of the
spot cloaked in rising vapor thatis torn to
shreds by the gales it is like a deep bowl
all around the great oval of the spot deep
and green with rank vegetation there are
swamps where the waters of the great rivers

fester and rise to mist in the frozen clouds
there are great forests and long low
plains-all gleaming strangely in the lurid
glare of the spot and the ship is low too
low and it is hot and hard to think

  suddenly a towering range of narrow
peaks shows below ringing the lowland
and in the fearful up-draft of their slope the
little rocket-ship is gripped and hurled end
over end aloft madly gulliver jerks at
the firing-lever the jets cough-and die
burnt out as he grabs at the reloader
the fury of the upper winds cuts into the
buoying up-draft and like a bit of down the
ship is tossed by the tempest hurled clear
across the cabin he creeps toward the lever
inch by inch year by year beyond the
port the red hell of the spot glares evilly
at his staring eyes and working lips inch
by inch-but the mountains are gone and
the falling air drops them mile on mil
toward the ghastly green swamplands a
lurch throws him headlong against the con-
trols-too late

  he gropes madly blindly for the lever
that is safety-yanks wildly at whatever his
hands meet with clang wings of metal
spring from the ships sides buoying it to
the planets surface there that one-no
-the other the entry-port crashes open
with a rush of pressing air and as he stares
dazedly at the rushing ground beneath he
sees dully four figures hurtling end over
end toward the swamp below for a brief
instant the ship levels then plunges toward
the forest and in that instant he leaps the
narrow plain that rings the swamp is rush-
ing up to meet him faster faster it is
hard to breathe then something strikes
his back with awful force and the world
goes black

	 

slowly he woke gasping for breath
the air was thick stifling and unbear-
ably hot and humid trying to burst into
his body and strangle him his ears throb-
bed with a dull thunderous roar from the
greater air-pressure and an awful weight
was bearing him down slowly painfully
he rolled over on his face pressed down
into the thick springy moss by the enormous
pull of jupiters gravitation inch by inch


wonder stories

lie gathered his limbs beneath him strug-
gling against the weight of his space-suit-
five hundred pounds of matter crushing him
into the ground his head rose above the
moss he looked about him

  above the forest the great red spot loom-
ed through the rising mists-a huge moun-
tain of molten rock oval raised from the
planets face by the whirling centrifuge and
tidal drag that will some day rip it free and
give it birth-another moon for the sover-
eign of the planets then the forest-a
matted tangle of unearthly olive-green tree-
forms glossy and uncannily still-at its
edge the rocket by fates whim unharmed
in its fall

  with superhuman strength he surged to
his feet then dropped with a grunt of re-
leased breath and wormed about to face the
swamp-edge whence a flaming ray has hiss-
ed past him in a torrent of whirling heated
air four forms grovel in the mud of the
swamp-one motionless a ray-gun blazes
again searing the moss beside him sending
up a stifling stench the moss seeming to
writhe away in alarm as air-currents whip
it

  his own ray flames-one form crumples
with a yell of agony an arm neatly gone
and as neatly cauterized by the heat of the
ray he cannot see but it sounded like
fred the young feller who gaye him the
books funny about those books bet
that other old gulliver never had a fight like
this

  hours pass hours of darting rays and
shriveling moss and flesh gulliver has
been hit twice-one arm is dead from the
elbow down-but in the swamp one man
alone returns his fire-bill for a long
time he has been quiet maybe he has run
out of charges for his gun probably its
just a trick to draw his fire and make a
target what the hell the damned fool
is gettin up-tryin to move toward him-
yellin at him tryin to pull a charge
hey not on this baby spat spat
got him-got him by god theyre done
for-all four of em the damned big-noses
tryin to get him

  what was that he was yellin when he
jvas burned down somethin about back

-back of you that old kids trick again
huh tryin that on him on lem gulli-
ver  damned fool

  what the hell seems like hes sinkin
deeper in the moss or else its growin high-
er theres a kind of wormy squirmin
movement goin on underneath him like he
was lyin on somethin that was tryin to
wriggle out funny feelin nasty an
creepy-like he rolls over on his back lab-
oriously funny theres a great big flower
bendin over him an theres another-three
more all around him he can see more be-
yond they werent there before-hed
stake his life on that what kind of a
place was this anyway too damned fun-
ny for him it was of the places hed
seen this beat all of em by a long sight

  where hed been lying the moss seemed
to be writhing under his hand squirming
out from under it and creeping over it on
all sides where he was he could feel it
wriggle under his back and see it sort of
bending over him where he pressed against
it it felt a lot like little fine feelers on his
hand little fine roots of the moss running
all over the back of his hand what the
hell that hurt damned if those roots
werent tryin to cram into his pores an
under his fingernails-no way at all for
moss to act take those flowers too great
big purple cups all splattered with gold
with little red tubes like feelers on the in-
side lets see there ought to be four of
em

  four-there are ten twelve-hey what is
this the damned things are growin up all
around him creepin right up on him while
he lies there it aint right

  somethin is drippin on his face-wet an
warm an sweet-smellin like perfume
makes him want to sleep-funny feelin
ow that was in his eye-it burned like
fire what the hell some on his hand
-lets look at it hey its purple stuff an
it wont rub off its set right into his skin
its juice from those damned flowers drip-
pin on him-puttin him to sleep damn it
it aint right

  good god the damned things tryin to
strangle him smother him-little thin red
tentacles winding about his throat a great
the red spot of jupiter



fleshy hood of livid purple closing down
over his face flooding his panting lungs
with the sickly sweet odor of death an-
other is on his wrist striving with the
moss-threads to worm down into his veins
and drain him of life god theyre attack-
in him

  with a mad wrench he tears free stares
wildly at the uprooted plants that still
writhe greedily with evil life at the wiry
moss scuttling over the surface of the ground
where he has lain damned plants tryin
to get him too well let em try gul-
livers luck holds

  but now comes a hushed sound a muffled
whisper a scraping rustle from behind him
behind-look behind thats what the
guard yelled with a surge of giant mus-
cles he tears his laden body from the cling-
ing mossstruggles to his knees and stares
in mounting horror moss-flowers-ahd
now the forest is marching to the attack

  once he screams-the only scream of fear
li his life of danger then surging mus-
cles bear him up and he hurls his body for-
ward-toward the trees that are sweeping
down upon him with a rustle of eager
branches and a scrape of writhing roots
hungry for the kill

  to an observer he must have seemed a
giant toad-a misshapen monster toppling
forward across the hungry moss in great
struggling hops two-three feet in every
lurch and still the forest-front creeps on
undaunted to meet the creature that leaps
and crawls to do it combat-a man of earth
unafraid

  thick leaves whisper greedily among
themselves drooping tentacular twigs
stir eagerly and uneasily looping and twin-
ing in hunger great smooth-barked roots
worm forward hump upward inch their
way through the thick moss that is itself
moving in shadowy ripples that converge

on the lone man who creeps and lurches
ever onward to the fray

  he has halted a limbless human stump
squatting half buried in the moss-waiting
his laboring brain whirls his ears roar with
the pressure of the atmosphere his breath
comes slowly heavily for the air is thick
and heavy to his aching lungs

  the many hungry blossoms hurry forward
on hunching roots their purple sucking-
cups nodding racing the great trees for the
prey the moss ripples faster the murmur
of fleshy leaves has become a minor roar
as of distant winds and still he sits and
waits as the deadly circle forms and closes
in on every side

  his ray-guns blaze again many times
fanning in a broad angle through the
surging jungle a great swath of death has
been carved straight to the rocket-hip in
great five-foot dives he bounds forward
driving his failing body to new struggles
new feats of strength and daring over
charred still-twisting tree-forms over seared
and matted moss over cinders that have
been flower-cups with little living red ten-
tacles he beats his way-to the ship and
safety behind the lane narrows closes in
after him but the lever is thrown the jets
fueled and with a thunder that sets the
leaves and tendrils into a frenzy of agony
the ship sweeps forward and up

  below at the swamps edge four long
narrow mounds show faintly in the eagerly
stirring green slime now the fierce up-
pouring chimney of the great red spot has
caught him and like a bit of fine down he
is hurled aloft in the grip of the winds-up
through torn cloud-levels up and out into
starry emptiness and as the belted bulk of
mighty jupiter shrinks astern and a uni-
verse opens ahead the lone eye of the great
red spot winks applause to lemuel gulli-

physics c at the time i registered for
professor clewes course meant only
three hours of necessary credit toward my
bachelor of science degree when i ans-
wered the roll call on the first meeting day
of the class i had lit-
tle intimation of the
part that the instructor
was to play in remap-
ping my future in a
way that even the
wildest of my boyhood
dreams never pictured

 the course dealt
with advanced elect-
ricity and professor
clewe was a world-
famed authority on
the subject i was
majoring in physics
with the idea of teach-
ing the subject even-
tually a vague and
almost forgotten uncle
had left me sufficient
funds to remove all
necessity of earning a
living and i had chos-
en pedagogy as a
pleasant avocation

  the cloistered life of
the university with its
comparative remote-
ness from the confus-
ion of the outside
world appealed to me
greatly i had but
little desire to plunge
into the bustle of mod-
ern commerce and the
dignified and more
leisurely field of re-
search beckoned invit-
ingly

 although barely
twenty-five my life

had not been an easy one until the passing
of my uncle brought affluence and made a
college education possible left an orphan
at an early age i had peddled papers done
odd jobs worked in lumber camps on
dredge boats and in factories i had even

 as we look back in his-
  tory to the actions the
  beliefs and the mentality of
  people of let us say the
  middle ages it is hard to
  conceive that a world of
  such ignorance supersti-
  tion hate and persecution
  could have existed

     similarly the people of
   other ages looking back to
   the th century will find
   it incomprehensible to get
   our mental attitude and
   understand why we live as
   we do

    a man who travels back
  from the future into the
  present as mr clark ash-
  ton smith showed so clear-
  ly in an adventure into
  futurity would find him-
  self almost in- an alien
  world this would be just
  as true perhaps more so to
  a man of the present who
  happened to find himself in
  a future age no time
  travelling story then can
  be truthful or fulfil its
  purpose that does not show
  clearly the difference in
  habit thoughts and feeling
  of people of widely separ-
  ated centuries

     the present story is one
   of the best stories of futur-
   ity that we have had the
   pleasure to print it ful-
   fils almost perfectly all
   that one could wish for in
   a picture of a far-distant
   age

 played two seasons of professional baseball
 in one of the tiny leagues that are mention-
 ed only in the back pages of spauldings
 guide

   as a result i did not fit in very well with
                        the conventional un-
                        conventionalities o f
                        college life i had
                        never been inclined to
                        make close friends
                        among my associates
                        my contacts with the
                        other students were
                        confined mainly t o
                        nodding acquaintance-
                        ships in the class-
                        rooms and on the cam-
                        pus my professional
                        record barred me from
                        the athletic teams and
                        -as i had never cared
                        for feminine society
                        being somewhat shy of
                        girls-i paid little at-
                        tention to the social
                        side of college life i
                        had a small apartment
                        where i lived with my
                        bouks and except for
                        occasional tennis
                        games with anyone i
                        could find i spent
                        most of my time read-
                        ing and studying

                  professor clewe
proved to be an inter-
esting lecturer and we
soon became warm
personal friends in
spite of the difference
in our ages i found
him a delightful com-
panion because of my
interest in his subject
he was accustomed to
discuss questions of
physics wtith me as if i were an authority
of his own standing instead of merely a
student

   after several months of comparative in-
timacy-for professor clewe had but few
friends-he confided that he was working


wonder stories

on an invention of his own that might revo-
lutionize communication his explanation
of his invention was long and exceedingly
complicated and much of it passed over my
head i am afraid simplified to everyday
terms he was attempting to discover some
means of sending radio messages in a
straight line like a beam of light rather than
on the customary hertzian waves which rad-
iated in all directions from the sending sta-
tion like ripples on the surface of a pond

  many others were experimenting along
this line i knew with varying success pro-
fessor clewe however was seeking an en-
tirely new wave or ray to carry the elect-
rical impulses which carry radio messages
after years of indiffer-
ent results he had discov-
ered an unknown wave of
a totally different sort
which he believed would
ultimately prove the solu-
tion to the problem

  the discovery had come
by accident as so many
scientific discoveries do
and as yet he had had
little time to do more
than experiment in the
most rudimentary way

he had been using small
models and had no way
of gauging the exact pow-
er or accuracy of his
machine at his request
one night i accompanied
him to his home-a bachelor cottage of five
rooms at least three of these had been
turned into laboratories and it was in one
that he had been conducting his experi-
ments

  professor clewe showed me the small
models of his sending set and i listened
eagerly as he explained them to me but
it was the completed machine occupying
one entire end of the largest room that
fascinated me at first glance it seemed a
confused mass of electrical apparatus con-
densers coolidge tubes generators tesla-
coils and other pieces of apparatus unknown
to me were linked together with an appar-
ently hopeless tangle of wiring

  i turned to the professor

  it looks like a high frequency experi-
ment of some kind i remarked trying to
follow the general hook-up with my inquis-
itive eye

  not exactly he laughed you might
call it a super-high frequency machine its
a transmitter-generator of the same type as
the smaller models but much more power-
ful some of the extra equipment is neces-
sary for stepping up the voltage to the re-
quired power i would hate to mention the
actual voltage which i believe the machine
will develop i completed it only today
and we will try it out tonight

e examined the
machine in silence
for some moments fin-
ally the professor turned
to me

  i have checked this
apparatus a hundred
times since this morning
and i am certain that my
calculations are correct
the small models worked
perfectly and i believe
that this one will also
operate successfully we
will make the first test a
real one

  five miles from here
he continued i have
fitted up a receiving set
in a garage on one of the
big estates i am going there now and i
will leave you here to send the first message
to me

   protested volubly at this arrangement as
i thought the honor of sending the first
words over the new wave should be his

  no he said in reply this is only a
private trial and the sending is the easiest
part i must be at the receiving end in
order to study my apparatus there and to
tune the receiver to the proper pitch it
may require a bit of delicate adjustment-
work that you could not do the transmit-
ter is completely in readiness all that you
have to do is turn the switch on the panel
and tap out a message with the key you

know the international morse code

  no but im familiar with the american
system

  just as good he replied

  he returned to the sending machine and
for some moments was busily engaged in
testing connections and making sure that
everything was in perfect order then
pulling on his coat and hat he spoke

  im going now its eight oclock on the
dot by my watch is yours the same

  we synchronized our watches and he
continued

  we had better allow at least a half hour
that will give me plenty of time to get
there in spite of possible traffic delays
then i will need a few minutes to get the
receiving set adjusted suppose you throw
the switch at exactly 

  i nodded agreement and he left hurried-
ly it was the last time i ever saw him

  alone in the laboratory i again turned
my attention to the professors transmitter
i was frankly puzzled with its intricacy i
was beginning to realize how little i knew
of the strange force men call electricity
but even to my inexperienced eye the mach-
ine suggested power such as few men have
gathered this was the type of transmitter
one would expect to find in use in inter-
planetary communication hurling its mes-
sages across the vast reaches of cosmic
space by sheer power its vastness and un-
known potentialities sent a queer shivery
thrill through me as i stood regarding it
silently

  i was conscious of a deepening interest
and a growing excitement in the experi-
ment i took out my watch and shook it
to make sure that it was going the time
was passing all too slowly for me i could
scarcely contain my eagerness while the sec-
ond hand crawled around its tiny circle

  after a seemingly interminable time dur-
ing which i explored the professors lib-
rary tuned in the radio in the living room
and wandered idly about the laboratory my
watch pointed to the awaited minute as if
to confirm my wrist watch the radio pro-
gram ceased and the gong sounded for the
regular quarter-hour station announcement
i cross the laboratory toward the panel

which contained the control switch the
key with which i was to send my message
was fastened to the horizontal base of the
penel and i hesitated for a moment as i
seated myself in the low chair wondering
what message i would send some theat-
rical impulse gripped me if the invention
proved successful just as epochal a moment
as the first flight of the wright brothers
i made my decision a new day dawns
would be the message i would tap out in
the morse code

  with my heart beating wildly i threw
the great switch the tubes began to glow
a great flashing spark leaped madly across
the uprights of the huge tesla coil and
continued to flow across the gap in a crack-
ling flash of fire the voltage i thought
absently must be tremendous the smell
of ozone was strong in the air of the little
room and i was conscious of a queer ting-
ling sensation all over my body i turned
to the key and pressed it down in the first
stroke of the morse a

  a blinding flash filled the room for
one instant i was conscious of a rainbow
aura around the machine the panel the
key and the meager furniture of the room
all appeared as if seen through a prism
distorted colorful then i swam in a great
blackness and lost consciousness

chapter ii
a strange awakening

i struggled back to consciousness with
the sound of many voices chanting a
paean of triumph in my ears my head
throbbed painfully and my limbs felt as
though they had been broken on the rack
every muscle ached as i attempted to raise
myself to a sitting position and starry pin-
wheels danced before my eyes i desisted
in my efforts and lay back with a moan
closing my eyes again

  i tried to recall what had happened and
after a bit i remembered the laboratory
the great machine and the professors experi-
ment i moved my hand and realized that
i was lying on soft grass with a slight
breeze blowing on my face someone


wonder stories

raised my head gently and i felt cold water
trickle down my throat presently cool soft
hands bathed my forehead and rougher ones
chafed my wrists gently

  my strength returned rapidly the ache in
my body subsided and i opened my eyes
once more the pinwheels had ceased danc-
ing and as i blinked in the soft light i
looked into a pair of golden brown eyes in
whose depth i could read compassion wel-
come and a hint of reverential awe as my
eyes grew accustomed to the light i discov-
ered the eyes to be set in a face whose loveli-
ness left me breathless framed as it was in
a cloud of wavy dark brown hair two
soft yet sinewy white arms supported my
head

  another face came into my line of vision
the face of an old man whose long white
beard and wrinkled features made him seem
incredibly ancient

  he spoke to the girl who held my head
and his words were close-clipped and swift-
ly spoken giving a staccato tone to his
speech she answered in a musical voice
using the same quick articulation

  he awakes she said

  the old man turned to those that sur-
rounded us at a slight distance and ad-
dressed them in a loud voice my mind
was still too cloudy to catch the swift words
of his message but it was greeted by a roar
of acclaim with the aid of the girl and
the old man i struggled to my feet after
a moment of unsteadiness i was able to take
stock of my surroundings

  my two companions and myself were en-
circled by a ring of what must have num-
bered several hundred people we stood in
what was evidently a park and huge street
lamps of an unfamiliar pattern lighted the
scene with a soft glowing radiance and
made the space where we stood as light as
day

  i turned to my companions and surveyed
them with interest my first impression of
the girl was confirmed she was beautiful
of face and her figure was as well-propor-
tioned as that of a dryad she was tall and
slender and her hair was clasped round
her forehead with a wide band of silver
bearing strange inscriptions she was

dressed in a loose-fitting tunic of white
girdled about the waist with a silver cord
the lower edge of the garment fell slightly
below her knees and her feet were encased
in silver slippers

  the old man seemed even more ancient
than i had supposed from my first glimpse
of him he too was clothed in a white
tunic that reached his ankles and which-
with his white beard hanging low on his
breast and his long white hair falling over
his shoulders-made him seem like a pat-
riarch of biblical days the tunic was
belted with a silver sash from the wide end
of which dangled a silver ornament in the
design of a four-spoked wheel like the
girls his hair was held away from his fore-
head by a silver band that carried queer
symbols

  the crowd which had become silent as i
arose stood watching expectantly i could
feel the intensity of their concentration and
subconsciously i knew that the undercurrent
of exciteipent which gripped them was in
some subtle way connected with myself

  i noticed that these spectators seemed
about evenly divided half were men and the
rest women the latter wore tunics simi-
lar to the girls but shorter coming several
inches above the knee and bound with sash-
es of various striped materials the men
wore blouses open at the neck and loose full
shorts harnesses similar to double sam
brown belts crossed in front and behind
passed over the shoulders and were at-
tached to broad leather belts the short
sleeves of their blouses bore various designs
similar to the insignia worn by army divi-
sions

i turned to the old man

what are they waiting for i asked

  they await your message he replied

  what message i do not understand

  you will know in time he answered
gently in the meantime you must speak
to them tffey expect it

  but what shall i say i was bewilder-
ed and none too clear in the head even
yet

  say anything something    only
rebellion -  ad



a few words will do the girl broke in in
an entreating voice

  i cleared my throat and took a few steps
forward the crowd was silent waiting

  my friends  i hesitated and the
words of my message to professor clewe
flashed into my hazy mind i continued
a new day dawns   

  the silence was broken by a tempest of
sound the people in the front rows pass-
ing my words back to those in the rear the
sound grew as all repeated the trite phras-
ing of my message then some one began
the chant that i had heard on awakening
another caught it up another and another
it spread like a ripple of wind over a wheat
field until all were shouting its cadences
ia unison it had a triumphant ring a con-
quering ring like the song of an army to
whom new hope has been given i was
alle now to catch the words that snapped
forth in sharp explosions of sound

         men arise

strike off your chains

         the night is gone

new hope appears

         lift up your eyes

a new king reigns

        a new day dawns

on bitter years   

  i caught my breath the very fierceness
of the song gripped me the way they
sang it a song of new faith  of
salvation   

  the old man raised his arm and the song
was stilled he spoke

  the day of deliverance is at hand my
children he said but the time for action
is not yet here pass the word among you
that he whom we have expected for so long
has come but guard your news carefully
lest it be known of those who rule go
now to your homes and be of stout heart
slowly the crowd dispersed and we were
left alone the old man turned to me
come let us go   

 but why where i do not under-
stand

  you are still dazed at the manner of
your coming

  but where am i what country is
this

  this is america the lights on the hori-
zon there are those of the city of chicago

  i looked in the direction he had indicated
and there far to the northwest i could see
starry lights twinkling and in the sky the
reflected glow of a great city the ground
where we stood was gently rolling but slop-
ing upward toward higher hills close at
hand the breezes freshened and brought
with it the breath of lake michigan

  we are in the dunes of indiana i
asked

  they were once known as that he re-
plied

  once known  i could not grasp
his meaning the accident and the queer
happenings of the past few minutes had
convinced me that i was in some sort of
delirium a wild idea struck me isnt
this the year 

  the girl looked at me wonderingly and
the old man shook his head

  this is the year  he said

the coming of the messiah

my mind was too dazed to absorb this
information quickly and i followed
my two companions unprotestingly as they
moved toward a grove of trees near at hand
it did not occur to me to doubt the old mans
assertion there was too much evidence
which tended to prove him right the
clipped staccato speech and the queer cos-
tumes of the people the very contours of
the dunes where we stood-the trees in
orderly rows and the cultivated park-like
appearance of what i remembered as un-
spoiled country where nature ran riot-all
urged the passage of considerable time
but how

  naturally in the course of my college
career i had heard much of the fourth
dimension of moving in time and of other
topics off the beaten track of science i
could only explain my present predicament
by granting that the professors machine
had hurled me-somehow-some way-
through three thousand odd years of time
it was unbelievable incredible yet the
fact remained that here was i-a normal
young man of the twentieth century-torn


wonder stories

loose from his own environment and drop-
ped in the center of a new age in a world
unknown to me in actuality and in theory

  of course i had read many books of the
semi-scientific kind forecasting the world
in the years to come and pointing out the
changes that would take place i tried to
recall some of the glittering pictures the
prophets of the future had painted all
sorts of descriptions had been given of the
superman of two thousand years or so hence
pointing out how evolution habits and en
vironment would change his appearance
and physical structure he would be a
large craniumed creature because of much
thinking and brain work he would have
weak legs and spindly arms from too much
dependence on machinery he would wear
glasses perpetually as a result of too much
reading and study under artificial light he
would have no teeth or hair of his own
and few if any toes

  i looked at my companions critically and
marvelled how little humanity had changed
physically in the thirty centuries and more
which had passed the man was old very
old yet he differed but little in appearance
from bearded grandfathers i had known
true his movements were almost as swift
and sure as my own and his wrinkled face
carried the bloom of perfect health but cer-
tainly these were changes for the better i
could think of many women i had known
and admired who were little different from
the girl of the brown eyes and none of them
equalled her in beauty or grace of movement
no whatever else had happened the human
race had not deteriorated physically if any-
thing judging from the uniformly healthy
appearance of the people i had seen the
race had improved considerably

  my companions led the way to an open
space among the trees where their airplane
rested i had no trouble in recognizing it
as such its exterior resembled in many
ways the ships of my own era the stream-
lined cabin curved upward from the bow
and receded toward the tail where it ended
in a point the propeller seemed very small
for so large a plane being no larger than
those of the one-man planes to which i was
accustomed the wings were similarly two

narrow fins extending along the sides of
the cabin for half its length these slanted
backward and with the rudder and tail-
pieces which were shaped like the end of a
conventional arrow gave the ship the ap-
pearance of a great dart there was no
landing gear i noted in amazement the ship
seeming to rest on its own flat under-sur-
face we entered the cabin and i saw that
the interior was very comfortably arranged
to carry six passengers deeply cushioned
roomy seats upholstered in a very fine
grained synthetic leather awaited us i
turned to my companions

  i do not know your names my friends

i said extending my hand mine is ken-
neth martin i am known informally as
ken

  i am jon ley the old man replied
this indicating the girl is leda ley
the daughter of my grandson who is dead

  i acknowledged the introductions not
overly surprised that he was the great-grand-
father of a girl who seemed but little young-
er than myself jon leys outward appear-
ance told of many more than the customary
tbree-score-and-ten years and his eyes
were the eyes of one who had lived for cen-
turies

  why are we here i asked as we took
our seats and who were the people who
chanted whom you sent away what was
the meaning of their song

on ley shook his head we have noi
the time to explain everything now he
said already there is great danger if
we linger here it will mean destruction to
all of us when we arrive at safer quar-
ters i will explain many things that you do
not now understand

  at the moment he continued i will
tell you that you were found outside the
city near the ruins of ancient buildings aj
young doctor who is one of us was giving
first aid to a man injured in an accident
when he saw a sudden electrical disturbance
nearby-a great flash of light-and when
he investigated you were lying there with
the aid of others he placed you in his flyer
and brought you here

  he saw in you the answer to a prophecy
rebellion -  ad



made one thousand years ago in a very
short time many people had assembled to
do you honor you are to those who be-
lieve in the prophecy a messiah a deliver-
er come to remove the yoke of the tyrant
from necks that long have borne unwilling
burdens small wonder that many of our
people will see you as a god one who comes
to us out of the past to lead us toward a
new future

  but i am only a man i protested a
man such as they are-like you yourself-
i have been plucked from my own era by
seme freak of fate and dropped into one
many centuries removed i am no god
nor can i pose as one

  no you are no god the gods are
dead the old man mused they died
many years ago-beyond the memory of
any now alive they who rule us have a
god of sorts to whom they render a toler-
ant patronizing sort of reverence as it
pleases them but the people have no gods
long ago they gave up all hope of divine
interference in their destinies the religion
that you knew died soon after the close of
your own century too much was known
even then of natures laws and man learned
to control them in ways that gods would
never have permitted and the clergy
trading their spiritual leadership for tem-
poral power lost the respect of the people
and became corrupt and futile

  no you are not a god he concluded
yet many will so regard you and will do
you reverence a god come not to save
mens souls but to save mens bodies and
mens intellect

chapter iii
the city

leda had turned to the controls of the
plane and i was watching interestedly
 wondered how she would get the necessary
run for the take-off since the plane was
without landing gear i was not long in
doubt the girl pressed a button threw a
switch pulled a lever the motor hummed
busily but quietly and i felt the ship groan

and rise quickly headed for the city we
had risen vertically from the ground

  i uttered an exclamation of pleasure
leda locked the controls and swung her
chair around to face us

  you are surprised she asked

  yes i am i admitted in my own
day it was necessary to run the plane along
the ground for some distance in order to
get the necessary momentum for taking off
and our motors were very noisy compared
t- yours

  we have progressed far since then she
replied i have read of your early strug-
gles to fly of the wright brothers and
curtiss and the rest the ships of your
day must have been very dangerous and
cumbersome compared to ours many years
ago our scientists discovered that gravity
is only an electrical phenomenon and
soon found a way to counteract it without
the earths pull against the ship-for the
nullifying current passing through the metal
hull makes the plane slightly lighter than
the air it displaces-there is no inertia to
overcome in taking off and there is little
danger of accident while the current is on
here is our power source

  while answering she moved aside a panel
in the wall of the cabin and i saw many
batteries connected in relays i was amazed
at their smallness they were all about the
size of an ordinary book and of the same
general shape i was becoming accustomed
to the amazing efficiency of this new world
however and i realized at once that these
small batteries were many times as efficient
as the cumbersome and wasteful affairs to
which i was accustomed

  they contain a great deal of power i
asked

  yes she replied more than we are
ever likely to use the gravity destroyer
uses remarkably little current and our mot-
ors use very little more every bit is
translated into action

  the old man roused himself from his
reverie and spoke half to himself

  there is nothing wasted today we are
efficient above all else there was a bit-
terness in his tone that spoke volumes and
strengthened my half-formed guess that the


wonder stories

 new world was not so much of a utopia
 after all

   as i pondered we were winging our way
 toward the city my mind was a seething
 mass of unspoken questions all clamoring
 for utterance the dismay the sense of
 utter helplessness that had gripped me when
 i first realized my translation to this new
 era had given way to an intense curiosity
 about the new life that faced me

   i was conscious of no regrets over the
 sudden termination of my former existence

 i realized that there were no ties binding
 me to the past i looked at my beautiful
 companion and felt a warm glow suffuse
 me for all its strangeness my new des-
 tiny offered many pleasant possibilities i
 permitted myself to lapse into roseate
 dreams

  look leda was pointing downward
 through the glass panel in the floor

   then i saw the city and i caught my
 breath as i tried to comprehend its vastness
 lit with a glow that seemed to illuminate
 every corner turning the night into day
 the city reared its head seemingly to the
 very stars we were flying at an altitude
 of several thousand feet yet it appeared to
 me that we must inevitably strike the tops 
 of some of the enormous buildings 

   the structures were breath-taking in their
 magnitude i had seen pictures of the pyra-
 mids and these huge piles of masonry
 brought them vividly to my mind yet i
 realized that the greatest of the egyptian
 monuments would seem as an anthillin com-
 parison

 as we neared the city i was able to see
 the architecture more clearly each
 building seemed as if built in the manner
  of a childs house of blocks each block
 being placed upon the other and each one
 smaller than the one it rested upon start-
 ing with a base several thousand feet square
 the building rose straight in the air to the
 height of thirty or more stories then a
 set-back and the building rose another
 thirty or so stories another set-back and
 more floors and thus after other series of
 set-backs and stories the building ended in
 a great flat roof where many air vessels

were constantly landing or taking off while
others were parked in regular rows around
the roofs edge

  although the buildings varied in height
the lowest levels or setbacks of all were
even and these levels were connected by
wide highways joining each building with
its neighbors as we drew closer i saw
that there were not so very many of the
great structures an even hundred of them
as i learned later but they were arranged
in regular rows three hundred or more feet
apart

  besides the highway levels they were
connected by threads of metal which my
companions identified as the tracks of the
monorail cars that carried the people about
the city i could see the traffic passing
between the buildings on the many levels
there were little blurs that i knew were
pedestrians and thousands of vehicles some 
small others large which i knew were mot-
or cars although they had changed until
almost unrecognizable these too were run
entirely by tiny but powerful electric mot-
ors

  i looked in vain for the trees and grass
the parks and boulevards that had been chi-
agos proudest boast in the early days of
the twentieth century as we hovered over
the city it seemed a wilderness of concrete-
or its modern equivalent yet the vast
buildings their orderly arrangement and
the stern vertical lines of their windowless
sides held something of beauty that was
unknown to the sprawling growing city i
remembered gone were the slums the
sordid ugly patches the smoky grime of fac-
tories and railroads the city for all the
mammoth proportions of its buildings oc-
cupied but a fraction of its former size

  as i watched the unending flow of traf-
fic fascinated by its orderly pattern as
well as the swiftness of its pace a deep bell
note sounded through the roar of the city
it was a clear though low-pitched sound
and it reverberated through the canyons of
the city reaching us high as we were above
it

  what was that i asked

  the bell the girl replied when it
sounds all activity ceases in the city and
rebellion -  a d



the sleep period begins in half an hour
all lights will be turned off and there will
be absolute darkness for eight hours 

   i watched the streets rapidly clearing of
 traffic airplanes like homing pigeons
 were fluttering to rest on the tops of the
 buildings in a very few minutes the city
 grew quieter and fewer sounds floated up
 to us the hum of busy humanity that had
 sounded to us like the buzzing of innum-
 erable bees died down to a gentle murmur

   in a few moments all will be silent
jon ley remarked

   but even as he spoke the noise increased
 and out of the buildings poured the people
 a hum of conversation reached us high as
 we were the tide of human beings in-
 creased until the streets were black with
 massed citizenry the girl turned to ley
  what has happened they have never
 defied the law thus all should be in their
 sleeping rooms for the lights will be turned
 off very soon do you suppose    
 even as she spoke we heard the triumph-
 ant notes of the chant sounded by the mul-
 titude it had sounded loud and joyous as
  we had heard it in the dunes but now hurl-
 ed to the heavens by a host of voices it de-
 fied description a tremendous exultant
 volume of sound that rose like the crest of
 a wave sweeping everything before it

   i felt a queer catch in my throat

   is that for me i asked

   the old man caught my arm in a bruis-
ing grip

   for you but too soon too soon he
said and his voice was strained to a hoarse
whisper they are undoing all of our
work all our plans are ruined

leda gave a sharp cry of alarm and
turned to the controls sending the
plane soaring upward into the blackness of
the night out of the north huge ships
were winging their way swiftly toward the
city each bore a great searchlight on the
bow which sent dazzling beams of light far
ahead	

   the guards she gasped the guards
have come

   the big planes hovered over the chanting
 multitudes the song was hushed as the

 searchlights their blinding glare cutting
 through the soft glow of the citys illumina-
 tion played over the crowds mens voices
 coarse and rough spoke through great am-
 plifiers warning the crowds back to their
 homes the words were harsh and grating
 and the messages were liberally sprinkled
 with vile and obscene epithets i squirmed
 at some of the coarser thrusts and glanced
 at leda her faceset in hard lines and
 anger shone in the glances she flashed at the
 planes of the guards

  the crowd hesitated silently for a mo-
ment then the chant broke out again and
spread until it hurled defiance to authority
in the fierceness of the singing

  they are defying the guards leda
breathed almost inaudibly and there was a
look of pride in her eye

  the dazzling white lights died out and
orange beams shot from other lamps on the
guard planes

  the ray the old man muttered they
are using the ray

  even as he spoke the beams of orange
light played over the crowds on the higher
street levels wherever the light struck
people cringed and fell the rays cut great
swaths in the packed highways and the song
wavered and died out

  they are beaten the old man cried
the revolt is broken and the rulers are
warned they know by now that the mas-
ter is with us and will be seeking him we
must go away at once before they discover
us to the camp

  the people were crowding into their
homes the crowds on the lower levels
seeing the rays used on the higher streets
had stampeded in wild disorder the up-
per terraces were deserted except for the
sprawling figures of those whom the orange
rays had struck the white searchlights
were again in use and even as jon ley
spoke their searching fingers began to
comb the heavens

  leda snapped on the motor and we rose
higher swerving and dodging to avoid the
groping pencils of light in spite of her
skilful maneuvering a beam struck us for
a moment and flickered over the plane be-
fore she could evade it at once two flyers

turned and mounted in our direction

  i had thought our little ship had flown
swiftly on its trip to the city but i was
amazed at the way it now leaped forward
the metropolis was left behind swiftly and
the guard planes redoubled their efforts to
overtake us her face grim leda gave one
look at our pursuers and moved the speed
control still higher the plane strained on-
ward quivering and vibrating at the unac-
customed speed the larger guard planes
fell rapidly astern and were hopelessly dis-
tanced but still we hurtled through the
night

chapter iv

the retreat

i must have slept for i awoke to full
consciousness as a slight jar announced
the landing of the plane dawn was break-
ing in the sky as we alighted from the cabin
i breathed deeply of the fresh clean air of
the morning and felt very glad to be alive
leda too felt the beauty of the moment
and we stood side by side watching the
changing glory of the eastern heavens i
diew a deep breath and turned to her

  its the same old glorious earth any
way even if times have changed i laugh-
ed its a beautiful morning isnt it
yes she said unconsciously slowing her
quick clipped speech to something nearer
my own lazy drawl a new day dawns
she was silent and a far-away look came
into her eyes

  why i asked curiously has that
phrase i uttered on the spur of the moment
made such an impression on you and on the
others

   that phrase as you call it has been
our watchword for centuries it was no
accident that put those words into your
mouth but destiny but you will know
about it later

  i shrugged my shoulders carelessly so
much would be learned in time mean-
while there were other questions

  i looked over our surroundings we
were it seemed on the sloping floor of a
great valley whose soil was of hard black

mud and rank grass from where we stood
it sloped downward to a small stream which
flowed into a little lake barely discerni-
ble through the trees to the south swamp
grass and reeds grew everywhere gnarled
willow trees drooped their heads in the
valley and on the shores of the stream on
the higher land beyond the point where
we stood were other trees some giants that
were decades old

  under one of the latter not far from us
stood a small frame building perfectly
square and rudely constructed into this
hut the old man had gone

  where are we i asked

  in the great valley

  and that river

  the mississippi

  i looked again at the quiet stream that
had once been the turbulent father of wat-
ers then as never before i realized how
new the whole world was to me many a
time i had ridden in the steamboats that
one plowed upstream against its swift cur-
rent often i had fished in it and had twice
attempted to swim its more than a mile of
width i had seen it in flood time-a great
sea of muddy brown water stretching miles
wide roaring down the valley and sweeping
everything before it leaving death and des-
truction in its wake

  you find it greatly changed leda ask-
ed fathoming my thoughts

  i told her of the river i had known-a
vast artery that carried the commerce of a
wide and fertile region a link in the great
lakes-to-guif waterway she explained its
change

  the world catastrophe made many
changes in this country and the springs
which feed it to the north are slowly drying
up i have seen ancient pictures of it when
it was a mighty river and it must have been
a truly marvelous sight we have few
boats today those that we have are but
gilded pleasure boats for the rulers and
freight ships that carry heavy cargoes on
the great lakes

  jon ley came to the door of the cabin and
called we entered the rude structure and
found breakfast waiting us-the first meal
in my new life i felt quite hungry and
rebellion -  ad



laughingly remarked that going three thou-
sand years without a meal gave one a hearty
appetite

  we had fruit-oranges of great size and
of a pleasant taste with very thin skins and
no seeds then eggs toast and a beverage
that was clearly a coffee substitute it was
not unpleasant to the taste but to one hav-
ing my preference for strong black coffee
it seemed weak and insipid

  you do not have coffee i asked

  no we honor the tradition of the
breakfast cup but coffee has not been used
for centuries this is made of grain

  i am afraid i will require some time to
grow accustomed to it i smiled but the
eggs are very good the hens have not
changed in all this time

after breakfast much to my surprise
i was presented with a small box of
cigarettes i lit one with some curiosity
wondering what changes had been wrought
in the fragrant weed they seemed very
mild and quite aromatic and i exhaled the
smoke through my nostrils with keen en-
joyment

  it is the one vice that seems to have per-
sisted jon ley remarked noting my sat-
isfaction they are perfectly harmless
however by scientific effort nicotine and
other more or less harmful elements have
been removed and tobacco is now enjoyed
by all ages of both sexes

  settled comfortably in the deep cushioned
chair i turned my thoughts again toward
my own position the many questions that
had been surging through my mind during
the past few hours crowded to my lips
surely there would not be a more favorable
opportunity than this to secure some infor-
mation about this strange new world and
the part i was to play in it i turned to
ley

  now will you tell me i demanded
why i was expected in an era that is so far
from my own in time that the very thought
of my being here is ridiculous and impos-
sible where have i been for three thou-
sand years that they seem but a few hours
removed from the moment i lost conscious-
ness in my own era and why did the peo-

ple chant their weird song what was the
significance of the battle in the city streets
who is it that you fear-whoare we now
hiding from

  the old man smiled at my impetuous
questions

  patience my son he said it is a
long story and i must go back many thou-
sands of years to the beginning as to how
you came here that i know not call it
fate destiny what you will even in your
time i believe there were those who claim-
ed all time to be relative and debated the
possibilities of travel in that medium quite
evidently you have proved such a thing
possible although even the most advanced
of our scientists who died centuries ago
failed to discover the secret

  i lit another cigarette and with a smile
toward leda settled myself to listen

  the story i must tell is the history of the
civilized world which is a tale of progress
and recession cataclysm and rebuilding
peace and war it is a tale of the futile
struggle of man against every obstacle that
nature destiny and man himself could raise
against the march of progress i will skip
the eons of mans climb from the lower ani-
mals since you are doubtless familiar with
its phases and our time is limited it cul-
minated thousands of years ago eighteen
thousand in fact in a highly developed
civilization on the old continent of atlantis
the progressive industrious and adventurous
atlantians spread over the known world
bearing their civilization and culture to the
farthest reaches of the earth

  then at the height of their power came
the cataclysm that plunged their country
beneath the ocean the great colonies in
europe africa and the americas complete-
ly exiled by the catastrophe allowed their
civilization to languish or were conquered
by barbarian tribes and exterminated so
mans onward march was stayed for centur-
ies

  there were many in my own time i
said who believed the legends of lost at-
lantis they claimed that the destruction
of the island was the true source of the
story of the biblical flood

  they were right he replied in the


wonder stories

year  a great cataclysm changed the
map of the world and raised a huge portion
of the ancient land above the sea excava-
tions by the scientists brought to light evi-
dences of a civilization exceeding all pre-
vious conceptions

  but to continue my story after the
downfall of atlantis the world stagnated
and culture languished the climb out of
the gulf of barbarism was achieved only af-
ter some thousands of years of painful ef-
fort not until the nineteenth and twen-
tieth centuries did the earth regain its for-
mer peaks of advancement then inven-
tions flourished and actual progress was
made at a rapid rate you annihilated dis-
tance and time music and letters and art
flourished science probed natures deepest
hidden secrets

the story of the cataclysm

lru know much of our times do
x all folks of this present era know
as much of us i asked

  only a few i have long been a student
of the olden days there are only a few
books still in existence that deal with your
era most of them have been destroyed
long ago those of us who own such books
keep them well hidden

  and the people of today what do the
great masses know of our times

  nothing their conception of history
is vague and indefinite the government
schools teach them only a little-most of it
propaganda supporting the existing order
they have their folk tales is it true of the
days when men had liberty and leisure tales
of fabulous heroes who fought personal
combats for the rights of men in the leg-
ends you can see vestiges of men you rev-
ered napoleon washington bolivar lin-
coln wilson and other men of ideals who
strove to make those ideals realities-seek-
ers of utopia

  the masses have been told for over a
thousand years that utopia has come and
all of the time their chains are being forged
tighter his voice was bitter and the lines
of his jaw hardened i said nothing and
he picked up the thread of his story

  in the years following your century men
forged ahead with new strides television
the monorail and its child the monorail
rocket car annihilated distances and brought
al nations closer together there was har-
mony in the world prosperity and work for
all with a scale of living that the world
had never known education the arts and
amusements grew and developed as mach-
ines replaced manual labor and mans leis-
ure increased

  man conquered disease and the span of
life was lengthened the population in-
creased until even the commodious earth
was crowded the last frontier was con-
quered and the far corners of the globe
were made habitable by science the five
hundred years following your time saw a
veritable paradise made of the world cities
grew to unbelievable proportions the
earths wealth staggered belief

  then from too much easy living the
people became decadent the power of
those who controlled the colossal wealth of
the world foisted weak fools in the high
places of government incompetent men who
would not interfere in the piling up of
power by their masters privileges and
pillage in the sacred name of commerce
grew greater and the selfish short-sighted
acts of the money barons brought discord
among the nations

  the year  saw the leading civilized
nations at war and when they were em-
broiled the hordes of asia struck the
leading countries attempted to unite in de-
fense but their real power had been wasted
in their struggles against each other the
millions of china russia and india swarm-
ed over the earth japan progressive and
industrious kingdom of one hundred mil-
lions was wiped out europe was overrun
and america attacked

  it was seventy long and bloody years
before the west conquered in the struggle
and in spite of all the science and learning
famine and pestilence swept over the world
decimating the population in the year
 there were left less than a billion peo-
ple on the earth and civilization was totter-
ing

  slowly the nations began to rebuild
rebellion -  ad



then mother earth who had slumbered for
centuries took a hand the year  saw
the beginning of a series of cataclysms al-
most unbelievable earthquakes of wide
and terrible destructiveness wiped out whole
cities tidal waves of mammoth propor-
tions swept in from the sea and great gey-
sers came out of the land as it settled and
forced the underground waters to the sur-
face

  then the continents were affected and
the year  saw the greatest tragedy since
the sinking of atlantis overnight the
greater portion of europe sank beneath the
sea the millions of its peoples drowning
like rats only a few escaped in flyers to
tell the story then parts of it rose again
to unbelievable heights and out of the at-
lantics depths rose the old atlantian con-
tinent the northern portion of africa
disappeared much of asia vanished and
the fabulous land of lemuria appeared
above the pacific

  the eastern portion of the american
continent was submerged and the western
coast was broken by earthquakes and de-
populated by tidal waves the caribbean
sea overflowed the south and the lowlands
of mexico the northern portion of the
mississippi valley rose the south ameri-
can continent was broken away from north
america and became part of atlantis al-
though much of it rests under water

  in your time the greatest of earths cities
were located on or near the seacoasts it
was still so before the great catastrophe-
and all were destroyed in the thirty-first
century the total population of the world-
centered in the middle west of your day
the highlands of asia the islands that rep-
resent what is left of europe and the dark
hinterlands of africa and south america-
numbered no more than a hundred mil-
lions

chapter v
a transformed world

sat silent as he paused in his narrative
appalled by this tale of holocaust and
world destruction it was unbelievable in-
credible

  one hundred millions i repeated stup-
idly why that is less than the population
of america as i knew it and india alone
had more than three times that number but
there are more than that in the world today
are there not

  we havent come to the modern world
yet he smiled but imagine the situation
of this remnant of the earths peoples hav-
ing seen their civilization their neighbors
everything they owned or valued swept to
oblivion awed horror-stricken they lived
in terror for generations never knowing
when they too would suffer a like fate
communication among the remnants of the
nations was lost the will to progress was
gone excesses of all kinds flourished

  the handful of people remaining were
stripped of nearly all semblance of culture
and became again superstition ridden those
who lived refused to bring children into a
dying world and the birth rate fell out-
lying countries weaker in moral stature
from the beginning returned to their prim-
itive gods and reverted to semi-savagery
only the remnant of america that had es-
caped the worst of the tragedy and central
canada clung to the outward semblances of
civilization

  but the year  or thereabouts saw
sanity returning the inner forces of the
earth had sunk again to slumber and our
people began to rebuild slowly they re-
vived the old arts and sciences and began
to develop new ones they discovered the
secret of gravity control and a new era of
efficiency dawned motors were developed
and perfected that would do a maximum of
work at a minimum of power machinery
rose to its former place of importance by
the year  we had reached and passed
the previous ages in physical attainments

  the population had increased but slow-
ly however and was entirely centered in
five great cities as it is at the present time
the science of chemistry had reached its
highest peak aftd nearly all human wants
were supplied synthetically many new
foods were evolved from grains and the
only animals in the land were domestic
stock kept for food purposes or as pets

  fast air transportation eliminated the


wonder stories

need for farms and small towns all the
grain fruit and vegetables needed by the
people were grown on the land within a
hundred miles of each city those who
labored in the soil went out each morning
and returned each night those who work-
ed in the factories and the laboratories
never left the city

  a few spots such as the spot where you
awoke-the old dunes-were set aside as
recreation centers and parks the rest of
the continent was left to nature and today
is only a wilderness as virgin as when the
ancient red men owned it trees and vines
have overgrown the ruins of the once great
cities herds of wild cattle horses pigs
sheep and dogs the progeny of those who
escaped the cataclysm roamed the prairies
that once were farms a few semi-savage
tribes descendants of negroes mexican in-
dians and a few of whites who survived
destruction in the ozark and kentucky-
tennessee mountains are still reported to
exist the rest of the world is much the
same a few cities are supposed to remain
in europe but i doubt if more than a hand-
ful of people today know of their existence

  then i said making an effort to grasp
the import of what i had heard the entire
known world the sum total of civilization
is in the five cities of this continent

  he nodded agreement

  of course the geography of the world
is known-or something of it in the forty-
first century scientists and students made
efforts to discover something about our new
earth in great air cruisers they flew over
the whole world making maps visiting the
far corners cataloging the flora and fauna
but remember over a thousand years had
passed since the great catastrophe and the
inhabitants of the new lands had grown
away from even the traditions of their old
life the expeditions were unfavorably re-
ceived several were wiped out in africa
and lemuria and others to asia and south
america were never heard from the at-
lantian expeditions found a fertile land and
many archeological treasures but no inhabi-
tants

  and you must remember that each of the
five cities had become an independent en-

tity each produced everything it needed
and there was no reason to exploit or even
explore the new lands

  but if that was done nine hundred years
ago surely you have progressed since then
i remarked i was slowly growing accus-
tomed to thinking in terms of hundreds and
thousands of years you must have a
great deal of time for study and research

leda who had listened silently to the
old mans story laughed it was a sad
little laugh

  but we have not progressed she said
we have gone far since then jon ley
agreed but in the wrong direction the
people of the present era are very down-
trodden and there is no incentive
what are the five cities of today i
asked curiously

  chicago is the largest with about thirty-
two millions sanpall is next with twenty-
eight millions then winnipeg with fifteen
lansing with twelve and demoyne with eight
millions respectively leda answered me
i did a little mental arithmetic

  then there are only ninety-five million
people in civilized america i asked

  yes she replied and all of them are
located in an area of a few hundred thou-
sand square miles

  but doesnt the population show any in-
crease

  no the birth rate is watched very
carefully only enough children are born
to replace those who die

  john ley took up the narrative

  as our cities had grown and our civili-
zation progressed our liberties were re-
stricted when the great cities were first
planned and built there were some who
preached communal ownership of all pro-
perty and of all industries but human
nature greed and ambition dominated the
great majority wished the thrill of owning
private property and the continuation of the
monetary system little thinking that they
were selling their descendants into slavery

  the inevitable happened as the centuries
passed given a restricted amount of wealth
among a certain number of people soon all
will be in the hands of a few thus it was
rebellion -  ad



with us there arose a class who lived by
capital alone who were the owners and who
reaped the rewards of the labor of others
this class grew more and more powerful
as generation succeeded generation and for-
tunes grew greater and greater those with
small fortunes grew fewer while the fac-
tories the property the laboratories and the
fields became the property of the rich the
masses of the population entirely dependant
on the products of the factories and the
plantations were completely at the mercy
of those who owned them

  inevitably those with unlimited capital
became the absolute rulers of the country
the lawmakers though for a time elected
by popular vote became only puppets who
worked in the interests of their masters and
now even those have given way to a here-
ditary council of twelve men who control
or own the entire wealth of the five cities

  this council makes our laws dictates
our comings and goings hires the guards
who govern us today we have no more
liberty than the black slaves of your ancient
cotton fields

  yet you seem an enlightened people
physically sound mentally alert and cer-
tainly able to visualize and carry out an
energetic defense of your liberties and
rights i exclaimed i cannot conceive
of passive acceptance of such a condition

  you do not grasp the picture the old
man reminded me remember this did
not come to pass in a year or two or in a
hundred years but is the result of over a
thousand think how much happened be-
tween your own day and the times of the
crusades and you will have a better idea of
the time it took and the psychological
changes that occurred remember too
that each generation was born to fewer pri-
vileges and pleasures the change was
very gradual

  the industries started as stock compan-
ies in which many people owned shares
some in vast apartment buildings some in
power plants some in the newspapers the
laboratories and factories while some own-
ed land on which they raised meat and grain
but as always happens many people could
not hold their stock and were forced to sell

it and in this way the few gained control
to pass it on to their descendants

  then the long arm of capital reached
into the schoolroom and into the nursery
rewriting the textbooks praising the existing
order of things through their self-owned
newspapers periodicals and television sta-
tions they strengthened their hold in ev-
ery conceivable manner invention ex-
ploration political economy everything
that threatened their grip on the people was
discouraged and later forbidden by law

  today the council of twelve with their
families relatives and dependant supporters
number less than two thousand yet they
hold in peonage ninety-five million people
every man of the masses has his work to do
and each receives a salary proportionate to
his services out of this he must pay for
light heat clothing amusement and taxes
standardized scales of living are prescribed
by law and at the end of each year a man
finds himself with  nothing regard-
less of the size of his income

  but what of doctors bills and other mis-
cellaneous expenses

  these services are furnished him and his
family at government dispensaries free of
charge when necessary in case of death
his body is disposed of at the city crema-
tory his two children that the law allows
him are born in government hospitals and
are educated at government schools each
being educated according to the station and
occupation of his parents

  in other words a caste system prevails
practically that although it is possible
for those who show great inherent talent for
different lines from those of their parents
to be placed in the positions they are best
fitted for

  and the aged    

  are cared for at the expense of the gov-
ernment after they are released from em-
ployment at the age of eighty

  at eighty but a man is feeble at that
age

  no more they have increased the av- 
erage span of life to  years and some
live a great deal longer few of the work-
ers however care to do so they are burn-
ed out when they leave their labors and

soon fail work today is not as you knew
it day after day for sixty years the fac-
tory worker sits before the machine he op-

drab monotony that eats out their souls while
yet in the prime of life they become auto-

die

regrets

the old mans voice relapsed into si-
lence and i sat musing over the per-
plexities of this strange new world sitting
at the breakfast table and smiling into the
laughing eyes of leda i had felt at home
among friends on familiar ground in the
light of what i had just heard i knew that
i was among strangers as far out of touch
with their life and civilization as if my jour-
ney had been through space to another
planet

  i considered the story from all angles
part of it i accepted without question the
great wars we had had one in my own
time that had embroiled the civilized nations
of earth with horrible loss of life and enor-
mous destruction of property and out of
it had come the epidemic of influenza that
in spite of all medical science could do had
killed more americans than the war

  i could not doubt his tale of geographi-
cal changes and natural catastrophes that
had wiped out whole continents we too
had had destructive earthquakes tidal
waves and volcanic eruptions islands had
been created in the empty sea or had sunk
below the water even in the nineteenth and
twentieth centuries who could say what
might not happen in over three thousand
years

  but i could not grasp the changes in hu-
man nature that seemed to have taken place
in that i found my mind unable to encom-
pass the changes in viewpoint that had taken
place through the centuries my own view-
point was still that of  when men were
liberty loving and-although civilization
and the pressure of growing population had
brought necessary restrictions-personal
freedom was still jealously guarded but

there would be time to study mans psycho-
logical evolution later

  i turned to the old man

  what is your position in this new scheme
of things and ledas

  we are not of the workers nor are we of
the rulers ours is a unique position we
are independents who have inherited small
fortunes that have escaped assimilation by
the great ones our ancestors profited by
the mistakes of others and lived well within
their incomes as a result we are able to
live without labor yet our scale of living is
but little better than that of the workers
we are not molested by the council as long
as we do not violate the laws-at least open-
ly he chuckled

  you mean   

  well there are some very peculiar laws
he replied no one is permitted to study
except under the supervision of the super-
intendent of education and then only from
textbooks authorized and approved by the
education committee of the council of
course these textbooks are pure propagan-
da everything pertaining to ancient history
that might reflect against the existing order
or create rebellion has been censored

  no one can study the sciences astrono-
my chemistry physics geography geology
or their branches except those in the official
laboratories sociology psychology and
philosophy are legally banned and almost
fcrgotten research work of any kind is
discouraged and today the alleged scientists
in the laboratories are little more than drug
clerks who compound old formulas there
has been no new invention for over five hun-
dred years

  but i am a lawbreaker none the less
he admitted continuing yui have inherited
a library of the old books and texts which
i keep safely hidden and study as i please
these i have supplemented with others sal-
vaged from old ruins in the days of my
ycuth there are only a handful of inde-
pendents and our goings and comings are
never scrutinized closely we may leave the
cities if we choose since we own our own
planes

  cant the workers ever leave the cities

  they are supposed to stay in them ex-
rebellion -  ad



cept on the holidays when they may go to
the parks and recreation centers where the
games are played indeed they have no
way of leaving the cities since they are not
allowed to own planes and the monorail
lines only traverse the city and extend to
the parks motor cars are small and are
used only in the cities as there are no roads
t- ride on outside the city limits

  i turned back to some of my original
questions

  but where do i came in why was i
expected surely you cannot trace to any
records of my disappearance in the past

  he smiled at my flood of questions and
answered the last one first

  i am sure that it was not that from
what you have told me you were simply
translated through time leaving no trace
behind your friends would simply mourn
your disappearance as an inexplicable mys-
tery your relatives might have made some
search for you but from what i have read
of your times disappearances were common
occurrences

  nodded in agreement

  but i had no relatives and only a few
friends of the most casual type they may
have wondered at my disappearance but i
am afraid they made little effort to find
me

  i grinned to myself as i thought that ac-
cording to my own conception of the time
that had passed-a matter of hours only-
my friends at the college were even then
searching for me while to jon ley and
leda in the same room with me the people
i called contemporaries had been dead and
fcrgotten three thousand years

  and was there no maid to mourn you
leda asked slyly 

  none at all i assured her i had lit-
tle time for them

  you must have been very busy and
i detected a hint of laughter in her tone
what did you do that was so all-import-
ant

  i was a student i confessed and in
those days the ones who really studied had
little time for other things you see our
lives were shorter we had fewer years of

  active life and there was so much that could
be learned now i find myself in a new
age where all i learned is useless i know
less of the world you know than one of your
school children

  no you cannot say that she cried
you knew a world that was highly com-
petitive where a man could carve out his
own destiny you know things of life such
as we never dreamed of i have studied
my great grandfathers books and i think
your days were part of the true golden era
jon ley also encouraged me

  you know many things that mankind has
forgotten through the years as to why
you came here i do not know perhaps fate
or destiny directed you perhaps chance or
accident you are here however and there
is none who knows how to send you back
even if we would let you go

  i looked at leda and smiled as she color-
ed slightly

  i have no wish to go back i said but
what will be my position here

  the people as a whole are satisfied with
their lot the old man replied they
ki-ow no better and their fathers before them
knew no better nor have they been taught
to conceive of better things but there are
some who are discontented and dissatisfied
they have kept alive the old tradition of
universal equality in spite of the efforts of
the council to eradicate all doctrines of the
old eras

  and among their folk tales handed down
by word of mouth from father to son is one
that tells of the coming of a man from the
distant past who will deliver them from their
slavery i think myself that it is a rem-
nant of the old belief in the second coming
of christ but since the death of religion
among the masses it has been distorted into
a legend of one who will deliver them from
the physical oppression of the council
and you believe that i am the man pick-
ed by destiny to act this part i asked

  i do not know he replied because
of my years i am venerated by the workers
i have fostered the belief among them think-
ing that it did no harm and that the geirm of
hope served to lighten their burdens this
sign i bear touching the silver ornament


wonder stories

  that dangled from his girdle is the symbol
of those who believe i have become the
priest of this-their only religion

  the council-thinking our cult a harm-
less reversion to faith-have tolerated us as
a group of visionaries but with your
dramatic coming filling as it does the con-
ditions of the ancient prophecy and my ac-
ceptance of you as the expected leader
makes us a menace to their supremacy
should the agents of the council lay their
hnds on you your life would not be worth
a moments purchase

  i received the news that i was virtually
a fugitive with a price on my head in si-
lence jon ley continued

  that is why we hurried you from the
city area at once when the ill-timed revolt
broke out now that they are warned that
one has really come out of the past they
will be doubly on their guard

  oh i said rather stupidly and puffed
hard on my cigarette my role in this new
drama was decidedly not to be one of mere
spectator then a new idea struck me

  but what if i dont choose to be a fifty-
first century moses if i tell the truth-
that i am only an accidental visitor who
asks nothing but peace-will the people and
the council not believe me and the cred-
ulous ones go on waiting for their real
messiah

  a look of disappointment flashed over
his wrinkled face and he shook his head

  im afraid it would do no good the
story has gone about now and the rulers
would think it a trick to gain time and
even if it were believed the disillusionment
oj the people who have hailed you as the
master would be a cruel blow

  well   i made a sudden decision
i will do my part to help them letthem
know i am no god however but only a hu-
man being who will help them to the utmost
of his ability in their fight for liberty
the old mans face glowed and ledas
eyes sparkled with excitement i extended
my hands across the little table and each
took one in silence but the way they returned
the pressure of my fingers brought a lump
to my throat

  and now that i have accepted my fate

i said decisively there are many things to
be done i do not intend to take a passive
part in the affair if i am to be a leader
i will be one in fact not in theory

chapter vi
the conspirators

four nights later we climbed into the
plane and took off into the darkness
toward chicago under the gleaming stars
the constellations though familiar were
slightly altered from how i had remember-
ed them all had shifted position a few
had disappeared but i wasted little time
on astronomy for my thoughts were entire-
ly on the stirring events that were already
shaping around us

  although jon ley had admitted his own
skepticism concerning the coming of a de-
liverer out of the past-his followers be-
lieved passionately and whole-heartedly in
the fulfilment of the prophecy the year
 had been the ordained date of the de-
liverance and my sudden arrival seemed
the answer to many centuries of expectation
and my aged mentor i knew was deter-
mined to take full advantage of the situa-
tion

  i learned that plans had been formulated
for the successful staging of a revolt but
they had been kept secret through many
decades waiting the coming of the mas-
ter they had been clever schemes too
and given the element of surprise they had
a fair chance of success

  the old man and his board of strategy
had counted to a great extent on the con-
tempt of the guards for the masses over-
powering their enemies by sheer force of
numbers the revolutionaries had planned to
gain control of the guards planes and the
deadly paralyzing orange ray now that
the time for action bad arrived the police
were on the alert the premature demon-
stration on the night of my arrival had fore-
warned them of the temper of the workers
the officials would take no chance of losing
control of their weapons by any surprise
move on our part

  i had learned from leda and jon that
rebellion -  ad

-

other weapons were unknown firearms
had died out soon after my own era while
their use and even their existence had long
been forgotten in the great wars gas fire
and electric wave projectors had played an
important part in destroying humanity but
even the secret of these weapons had died
out the only war instruments centered in
the hands of law and order were the orange
ray projectors on the guard planes in-
deed there had been no need for lethal
weapons crime through strict application
of the death penalty had died out except
for infrequent minor infractions of the num-
erous laws there were no enemies left to
challenge the supremacy of the cities the
half-starved wandering hordes that inhabi-
ted the wilderness kept their distance

  i had inquired concerning the weapons of
these nomadic tribes but my companions
knew little about them clubs rude spears
and even ruder bows and arrows apparently
served their needs any help from them
was quite out of the question

  none the less as we sped through the
night i was occupied with the problem of
arming my supporters in making my de-
cision although i did not regard myself as
their promised deliverer i had resolved to
lead them until their rebellion had been suc-
cessful or had failed utterly if the for-
mer i could turn over the power to a suc-
cessor elected by the people if we failed
-well i could visualize the outcome my
reward would be the age-old penalty for
leaders of unsuccessful revolts-death

  a word from leda warned me that we
were approaching the city i made up my
mind hastily we must have guns of some
type or other i cursed my own lack of
curiosity back in the old days whii i could
so easily have studied the intricacies of fire-
arms like so many others i had accepted
rifles revolvers and cartridges as matters
of course like the majority of boys i had
made gunpowder sub tosa in the high
school laboratory when i was supposed to
be making up back experiments in chemis-
try i remembered its constituents and be-
lieved with a little experimenting i could
find the right proportions of the ingredients

  a sudden thought struck me even if i

succeeded in making arms of some type i
would have no time to teach marksmanship
to my army but there was one type of
weapon that needed no experienced eye-
the riot guns sawed off shotguns used by
both gangsters and police of my own day
with telling effect i was confident that i
could design a shotgun of sorts and cer-
tainly there must be artisans in metal among
the rebels with their help i decided it
would be possible

  the humming of the motor suddenly
ceased and we hung over the darkened city
the great bell had sounded over an hour
ago and all lights had been turned off the
immense buildings with their sleeping mil-
lions loomed gigantic in the darkness my
first glimpse of them had been amazing
enough but because of the disturbance in
the streets i had not studied them carefully
as i peered out into the blackness i tried to
trace their solid lines with the network of
streets connecting the different levels far
below us a beam of light was visible feel-
ing its way among the great structures i
turned questionably to my companions

  the guards plane leda answered my
unspoken query

we continued to hang motionless at our
great height while the guards made
their leisurely inspection another beam of
light to the west showed that more than one
ship was patrolling the city streets while
we watched the plane turned slowly toward
the north silently as a withered leaf it
began to descend directly below us was
the flat roof of a building with infinite
caution leda maneuvered our craft until it
settled softly to the roof i rose to leave
the cabin

  wait jon ley cautioned

  for some moments we listened intently
to make sure that our arrival had passed
unnoticed hearing nothing to indicate the
approach of the guards i followed my com-
panions down a flight of steps into the in-
terior of the building here we found an
elevator that whirled us swiftly and silently
past tfce hundred or more floors to the
basement

  we left the car traversed a short corri-


wonder stories

dor and entered a small room after ley had
unlocked the door with a key from the
pocket of his tunic

  who a voice challenged us in a rasp-
ing whisper	

  jon ley

  the master is with you a different
vcice inquired

  he is here

  at once the room was flooded with light
from a small lamp on the table and i look-
ed about me besides my two companions
eight other people were grouped about the
small room six men and two women they
greeted me gravely

  hail master said one in the rasping
voice that had first greeted us i extended
my hand and as he came forward to grasp
ir i took stock of him i am no child
standing almost two inches over six feet
and weighing more than two hundred
pounds but he towered a good three inches
over me and must have outweighed me thir-
ty pounds his yellow hair waved rebel-
liously backward from a fine forehead and
his grey-blue eyes looked into my own
green ones with steely directness the great
muscles bulged in his bare forearms and his
square jaw was set in a determined mould
he would have been handsome but for a
red scar that zigzagged across his left cheek
from eye to mouth he clasped my hand
reverently in both of his and a look of
something akin to awe appeared - on his
features

  another man approached a- smaller
stockier man whose hair gleamed red in
the light he too was well-developed and
his fine features broke into a smile as i ex-
tended my other hand to him

  dik steel ley explained to me wras the
name of the giant and the smaller man was
lon mede others came up and were pre-
sented to me lee sale the young doc-
toi who had found me and brought me to
dunes park and the care of ley don
wolf slender as a lathe and giving the
impression of rapierlike strength wil
gore a studious appearing young man
whose stained hands told of work in the
laboratories and ben duse big and silent

whose copper-tinted skin black hair and
eyes and high cheek bones told of indian
blood that had persisted through many gen-
erations the two women were the wives
of mede and stele

  introductions over i repeated my pledge
that i would lead them and their cause
would be my cause until success was won
or all hope gone dik stele who seemed
the acknowledged leader of the group an-
swered me

  god or man it is enough for us that you
are here as the old saga foretold we be-
lieve you were sent to help us and will
follow you to death

  he resumed his seat on the great bench
and the others murmured their assent we
talked of the cause and i found my forces
comprised some twenty-five thousand work-
ers of various grades and their wives and
families bringing the total in the neighbor-
hood of  people all pledged to the
dream of liberty the six were the leaders
and jon ley had ruled as a regent until
the coming of the leader

  what of the great mass of the people
i asked

  they will swing into line stele an-
swered we have limited ourselves to
those we were sure of people who are bet-
ter educated than the average and who have
kept alive the old traditions with this as
our standard

  from inside his tunic he brought forth
a faded time-worn bundle and shook it
forth-a small american flag the red of
its stripes still gleaming bravely i fingered
the banner tenderly and seeing fully sixty-
four stars in the small blue field realized
that it must have been made many years
after my own era the extra stars canad-
ian provinces perhaps and mexican states
that might have joined the union in -the dim
past or new states carved out of territories
and old state boundaries

  in hoc signo vinces  i murmured

  you said   stele asked

  in this sign conquer i translated let
this be our banner it was once a pledge of
liberty to the oppressed of the world let
it wave again over our cause
rebellion

then came the question of weapons
and i outlined my plans for con-
structing them here i found mede and
stele of invaluable aid as the former was
a metal artisan and a designer while the
latter was superintendent in one of the
great foundries we pored over the rude
sketches i had made and i explained the
nature and purpose of shotguns mede
quickly grasped the technicalities of con-
struction and agreed to work out the de-
sign stele felt certain as he was compar-
atively free from supervision that the guns
could be made in his foundry using help
that was loyal there were machines al-
ready in operation that would perform much
of the labor

  jon ley listening to our talk chuckled
ir his long white beard

  you are truly the master he said
you would use the councils own factor-
ies to make the weapons that will overthrow
them it is a good plan

  what would you i replied there
isi not time to establish our own plants al-
ready the council knows of my coming and
will look with suspicion on any movements
by a body of workers this way we will
have good metal efficient workers and ex-
cellent machinery at our command

  next came the question of ammunition
i knew in a mechanical age we would be
able to secure quantities of steel ball-bear-
ings that would serve even better than the
lead shot but the cases with their com-
plicated construction presented a problem
stele watched asking occasional questions
as i sketched a diagram of a shell

  we can easily make cases of metal al-
so perfectly machined to fit the inside of
the guns he said but what are you
going to use to hurl them from the gun

  i explained how gunpowder worked he
ncdded comprehension

  wil gore can help you there he said
he is chief chemist in one of the largest
laboratories and has the power to engage
in research within certain limits

  from gore i learned that salpetre sul-
phur and charcoal were in common use and
ho could also produce the fulminate of mer-
cury to ignite the shells if any of the sub-

-  ad	

stances were not available he would see
that they were made

  you can not make sulphur surely i
suggested that is a basic element

  but we can he smiled long ago we
found out how to readjust the component
electrons and protons so that we can make
any substance at will it is a very neces-
sary part of our work since many elements
are no longer obtainable in their natural
states

  we decided on a hundred guns to be dis-
tributed among carefully selected sub-lieu-
tenants who would be instructed in their
use each of us were to be supplied with
them together with a quantity of ammuni-
tion i found that the guards depended
ordinarily on short wicked whips whose
keen lash as well as the heavily weighted
handles made them formidable weapons
hence we decided to arm the mass of our
followers with long-handled spears i felt
that they would prove wickedly efficient in
this weaponless world

  the people were usually passive and sub-
servient and the ray projectors served to
bieak up the infrequent demonstrations
these orange rays i found were similar to
intensified infra-red rays-although visible
-and it was possible to use them as car-
rier waves for electric charges of high in-
tensity they had a paralyzing effect on
the nerve cells and lengthy exposure to them
proved fatal by increasing the charge
too they could be made instantly lethal
in their intensity although the range was
short

  the only projectors were in the hands of
the council and had been for centuries i
considered the possibilities of constructing
similar machines but none of the group
was able to supply any definite information
about their design i gathered that the
secret was kept closely guarded by the
council and decided to confine my efforts
to weapons i understood

  at last stele glanced the tiny chronometer
on his wrist and announced that the time to
break up had arrived it was settled that
i should go disguised as a worker to the
laboratory with gore where we would work
on our powder mede would complete the

designing of the weapons and stele would
prepare a place in the foundry where they
could be manufactured away from prying
eyes sale the doctor was to be liaison
officer since he could move freely about
the city between our group and the lesser
leaders wolfe was in charge of the mono-
rail system and would organize his most
loyal subordinates so that when the day of
revolt arrived the transportation system
would be in our hands duse chief of air
pilots was to organize a squadron of flyers
of the fastest planes

  we chose for the meeting place of our
forces the great central plaza-a parklike
tract of land in the midst of the buildings
it could easily hold the entire population
of the city if necessary and no street levels
oj monorail tracks passed over it our men
could reach it by rail in a few moments
from any portion of the city while planes
ii any number could land or take off there
we set the time at dawn one week to the
day

  and may our efforts be successful i
said as we departed and the others answered
a new day dawns     

chapter vii
the revolt

one week passed-seven days of fever-
ish activity for the new and secret re-
volutionary party under the skillful di-
rection of stele and mede thousands of
pike heads were prepared and fitted to
stout handles these spears wielded in the
hands of determined men fired to fanaticism
by the intensity of their struggle against
oppression would do deadly execution
against any who opposed them

  the guns turned out in the dead of night
by the light of improvised lamps by some
of the finest craftsmen in the city exceeded
even my wildest expectations from my
rude sketches and explanations the two had
evolved weapons that would compare fav-
orably with the finest shotguns of my own
day they were double-barrel affairs and
were surprisingly light being made of a
beryllium-steel compound lighter than

aluminum yet stronger than any other metal
alloy the barrels were long to give added
range and the well-balanced stocks while
crudely finished were made of a synthetic
rubber compound hard yet flexible enough
to offset the recoil

  in the laboratories gore and i had exper-
imented until we had powder which while
not having the efficiency of the smokeless
powder-was equal in power and ef-
fectiveness to the once-favored black var-
iety with the amazing efficiency of the
day cases were turned out in a plentiful
quantity and filled under my direction

  as laborers going out to the fields my
rifle corps had left the city the morning be-
fore and flown many miles into the wilder-
ness here safe from the prying eyes of the
guards i gave my men instructions in load-
ing unloading sighting and firing their
strange new weapons we had no practice
at marksmanship since i felt that little would
be gained and a great deal of good ammu-
nition wasted in spite of the half-choked
barrels i knew that the steel shot would
spread sufficiently to be effective over a
wide area all the men need do would
be to point the weapons and pull the trig-
gers at the proper moment

  i shot off several rounds of shells to il-
lustrate my points and found the weapons
marvelously efficient in spite of their hasty
construction as we were making prepar-
ations to depart an inquisitive pig the
scion of domesticated porkers who had run
wild in the jungle nosed his way into the
clearing where we stood and regarded us
inquisitively from a safe distance i rais-
ed my weapon hastily and fired although
fully fifty yards away the pig vanished
leaving only torn shreds of flesh my army
seeing a practical demonstration of the new
weapon gripped their guns tighter and
their lips set in grim lines that boded no
good for the ruling council and the guards

  at dawn of the great day our men wait-
ed each in his own home for the great bell
to sound the end of the sleep period the
gong that sounded the call each morning
for the workers to arise and prepare for
work would today be the signal for their
revolt
rebellion -  ad



  in a small swift flyer i waited with ben
duse and leda on the top of one of the
highest buildings i had not wanted leda
there for i knew that ours was a dangerous
mission but she had insisted on coming
and at last had her way

  i will go where you go she had said
should you die i will die too i will not
live away from you and in the thrill of
my discovery of her feelings toward me i
had given in reluctantly

  i knew our blow would not be entirely
unexpected the council whose guards
and spies were everywhere had long since
discovered something was afoot as proven
by several efforts to capture me that had
failed only by chance and the devotion of
some of our followers i did not doubt
that many squadrons of the guards waited
the signal even as we waited it our own
bpies had reported that the council had
increased the number of guards during the
last few days and though their weapons
would be but the whip and the orange ray
our victory-if victory was our portion-
would not be entirely bloodless

  the first pink streaks of the dawn show-
ed on the eastern horizon we sat in si-
lence smoking cigarettes guardedly grad-
ually the stars faded and the day was at
hand the mammoth buildings stood out
nakedly in the cold morning air their win-
dowless sides grim and forbidding the
street levels bare and deserted yet i knew
that within those buildings were hiany
others waiting only the bell to strike even
as we waited

  then came the gong its liquid golden
note reverberating and quivering on the
still air its tone lingered and died echo-
ingly among the farther building as i look-
ed again at the city from every building
people were streaming into the streets the
ijiajority of them massed aimlessly on the
different levels sensing something unusual
around them but not knowing just what was
happening but here and there in the
crowd were men carrying spears who moved
purposefully toward the platforms of the
monorails then came the cars great
cabins swinging along suspended on their
slender rails at each platform new re-

cruits surged into them and the cars swung
on toward the meeting place

i watched car after car pass along those
lines that were visible from where i
stood as each filled with their human car-
goes gave way to empty ones truly sale
was doing his part effectively 

  the indian touched my arm and i tore
myself from watching the milling thousands
in the streets duse pointed to the north
faint in the distance from that further por-
tion of the city where the rulers dwelt i
could see the guard planes winging their
way toward us

  come ben said starting the plane and
i followed him inside a whir of the tiny
motor and we were off toward the gathering
place as we rose in the air a flag of red
and white stripes with white stars on a blue
field broke out from our rudder and flut-
tered madly in the wind

  from every roof around us planes took
off and followed ours falling into the v-
fcrmation used by war planes of my own
day we rushed through the air toward
the plaza far away i could hear the wail-
ing of the sirens on the guard planes as
they approached and far below us i could
hear the thunderous voice of the crowd
they were singing these slaves of the rich
singing the chant of deliverance and their
voices were jubilant inspired i turned to
ben duse at the controls of the plane

  a singing army is never defeated i
said

   may it be so today he replied

  then we were over the square and i could
see the men with the sun glinting on their
pikes massed in orderly rows and at their
head the giant figure of stele with his little
company of riflemen approaching from
the other side of the plaza were the ranks
of the police their whips swung over their
shoulders steel glinted in their hands and
i saw that each carried a long sword then
i knew that with these trained and drilled
men meeting our steel with steel the odds
would not be so overwhelmingly in our
favor we outnumbered them three to one
but our forces were untrained and undis-
ciplined


wonder stories

  we sped over the square and i saw the
planes of the council rushing to meet us
the projectors in the bows of each plane
glowed with orange light and i knew that
their beams were being directed toward us

  how far is the beam effective i asked

  less than two hundred feet in the day
time duse answered but under that
range they will penetrate even the glass of
these cabins

  then we wont let them get that close
i said reaching for my gun

  we were very near to the first plane now
i threw open a small window in the front
of our plane and took careful aim i saw
the man at the controls of the guard plane
jump to the ray projector and move a lever
frantically i felt my shoulder go numb
as i pulled the trigger the gun blared-
both barrels-and i was hurled away from
the narrow slot by the recoil but my shot
was true for when i looked again the ray
projector and a large portion of the front
end of the plane had disappeared the
ship drifted idly with its gaping front and
then slowly at first but gathering speed it
sank toward the ground far below as it
crashed i turned to leda handing her my
empty gun and receiving a fully loaded one
in exchange

  you injured their anti-gravity current
she remarked

  duse was guiding the ship swiftly toward
the next enemy plane the guards were
flying in single file-some distance apart
and there were fully twenty of them oppos-
ing our fifteen we met the second and i
profited by my first encounter firing be-
fore the ray reached the effective range
my shoulder was still numbed from the dose
it had received weak though it was this
time i shot from the left shoulder resting
my gun on the ledge and taking a snap shot
with one barrel as before the projector
and the front glass of the plane received
the full charge and shattered as duse
swept over the crippled ship i poured the
charge of the second barrel into the gaping
hole i caught a glimpse of the horror
stricken face of the pilot as his ship began
its sickening dive

  then we were past him and sweeping
toward the next plane i reached for the
reloaded gun and another ship went down
to join the first two

  noting the fate of its predecessors the
fourth plane held back waiting its com-
rades to come up they bunched and came
toward us slowly in a solid phalanx but
we too were prepared duse slowed our
plane as did the pilots nearest us while
those of the wings of our formation rushed
forward from an inverted v we became
a great u the points encircling the enemy
before they could solve the purpose of this
maneuver the ends of the u closed into an

	and we began the ancient form of fight-
ing used by the indians in raiding emigrant
trains in a wide circle beyond the range
of the stabbing orange rays wre swung
around them leisurely all the time pouring
a rain of death and destruction upon them
massed as they were the first disabled ships
impeded the progress of the others even
my inexperienced gunners could not miss 
and under our withering fire over half of
them were out of commission in the first
few minutes the remaining ships rose in
an effort to escape we shot them down to
destruction on the buildings and the streets
below us

only four were left when they made
their last desperate attempt to avoid ex-
termination full at the circle of slowly
moving planes they hurled themselves one
went down and the orange rays of the other
three cut through our line two of our
planes dipped and hurtled to the ground
the circle broke and they were loose it
was a desperately courageous maneuver and

	applauded it but the three planes must
not escape

  swiftly we straightened out in pursuit
and i blessed duse for his selection of our
ships we flew at a speed that i had not
believed possible and rapidly overhauled
the larger heavier guard ships from a
distance of but a few yards i sent the rak-
ing blast from my gun through the side
windows of the nearest plane the charge
struck the control board demolishing it
we turned to the second plane and found it
rebellion -  ad



already besieged by several of our squadron
passed it and hurried toward the last one

  above it i cried as we came near
knowing the projectors could not be turned
upward as we hovered above it i fired
through the trap in the floor taking careful
air at the ray lamp projecting from the
bow it disappeared as if sliced by a giant
knife i turned to ben

  circle them

  he did so threatening and crowding the
plane until it came to a stop

  signal them to turn back to the city
plaza i called to leda tell diem we will
spare their lives if they will do as we di-
rect

  she spoke the message into the radio of
the plane and received an affirmative answer
from the guards

  we turned back toward the city our squad
swinging in behind us as we approached
the plaza the crowds on the tops of the
buildings and on the upper street levels
saw us some cheered wildly others were
silent and i wondered at this greatly

  we reached the plaza and our planes set-
tled slowly to the ground among our land
forces and the hordes of murmuring cheer-
ing people behind them we stepped from
our ships and looked around us there
was no need to ask who had won the
ground was dotted with crumpled contorted
figures many wore the brief white gar-
ments of the workers the sign of the wheel
crudely fashioned on the breast of their
tunics silent proof of the fighting qualities
of the councils forces but the majority
of the inert bodies wore the nile green of
the guards

  a tall figure swung over towards us with
great lumbering strides dik stele a red
welt crossing the old scar on his cheek and
blood streaking his white garments be-
side him trotted the stocky figure of mede
likewise blood-spattered and with his left
arm crudely bandaged dangling uselessly
at his side

  master stele gasped you are hurt

  my arm was struck by the ray but it is
nothing you have won

  yes the councils forces are beaten

  where are your prisoners

  prisoners the big mans face was
puzzled we took no prisoners all who
have not escaped us by flight are-there
he waved his hand expressively in the di-
rection of the battle field

  i could not blame my lieutenants after
centuries of abuse and ill-treatment at the
hands of the guards i knew that the people
felt that nothing short of complete annihila-
tion was sufficient punishment for the green-
clad enemies

  then leda and duse approached the lat-
ter herding the ten prisoners from the cap-
turned plane in front of him my gun slung
over the crook of his arm with all of the
nonchalance of a tennessee squirrel hunt-
er i turned to the captives as he halted
them before us

  who is your leader

  one of them stepped forward a few paces
go back to the palaces of the council
i said and give them this message we
are in complete control in chicago tell
them the master rules and the old order is
ended i will treat with the council in this
place today one hour before sundown they
must meet me here

  he stared at me incredulously

  but sire he cried the council-they
will never come

  the council is not composed of fools
i said they will come tell them how
their forces were wiped out in the city tell
them what happened to the ships of your
fleet and tell them that if they are not
here on the appointed hour i shall seek them
out in their homes and not a man woman
or child will i spare if they come they
have the word of the master that no harm
will befall them

  then as the sun reached high meridian
the plane sped off to the north with its tale
of defeat the day was won and the city
was in our hands

chapter viii
the terms

we met the council in the plaza that
evening they came in great ships
of blue whose appointments spoke of luxury


wonder stories

hitherto unknown on the planet their
planes settled gently to the ground in a
group near the center of the square where
i awaited them with jon ley and my six
lieutenants behind us stood our forces
drawn up in a semblance of review forma-
tion the crowds of the citizenry grouped
themselves in the plaza and on the nearer
buildings

  out of the planes came the councilors
and their retainers they moved slowly
toward us hesitated and finally came to a
halt at a distance of a hundred feet stele
went forth to meet them and returned with
twelve men whose tunics of darker richer
blue identified them as members of the
council these were the men whose riches
had held ninety-five million people in vir-
tual slavery

  i regarded them closely all were
men of middle age and more than one
showed the wrinkled skin and white hair of
advanced years almost without exception
they were short stocky men and the volum-
inous folds of their blue toga-like garments
failed to hide the gross contours of over-
indulged bodies cruel hawk-like eyes
peered out from fat faces in striking con-
trast to sensuous mouths and weak chins
and on all of their faces appeared mingled
expressions of fear hatred and disdain
they feared us but they looked down upon
us with scorn born of generations of con-
temptuous toleration of the servile working
classes and in the society that had spawn-
ed them there existed but two classes-
themselves and their slaves

  they listened in silence as i told them of
the breaking down of their power of the
defeat of their guards the annihilation of
their fleet i can only imagine the bitter- 
ness that filled their hearts as they heard
the story of the end of their former regime
yet not by the slightest change of expression
did they betray any feelings but those of the
utmost disdain for us and our achievements

i paused when i had finished the story of
our victory and one the leader of the coun-
cil spoke

  we grant the truth of your assertions
what are the terms you propose what is
it you want of us

  i considered carefully before replying

  we who fought in the struggle ask noth-
ing for ourselves our efforts were made
in the name of the people and in the final
analysis it is to them that you must go for
terms i said as temporary representa-
tives we have outlined the major terms
which i now give you

  first you will relinquish all claims to
the government the courts and the keeping
of the peace which shall be turned over to
duly elected representatives of the people

  second you must give up all claims to
ownership of factories property fields and
laboratories retaining only your personal
property and unemployed capital all in-
dustries on which the people depend for the
necessities of life will henceforth become the
property of the government

  third all class distinctions will be abol-
ished and in all further dealings with the
people you must meet them on a common
footing

  fourth you will turn over to the new
government the secret of the orange ray and
any projectors that still remain these will
be reserved for the common defense

  the council considered our terms among
themselves for some moments finally the
leader spoke

  the fourth provision is impossible you
have destroyed the entire supply of the pro-
jectors and the secret was destroyed with
them there are none now alive who know
how to make them as for the other provi-
sions what is the alternative if we refuse
to surrender our rights in this way

  defeated despots have no rights i
warned them you would not be alive
thirty seconds from now if i but gave the
word dont you understand that you are
entirely at the mercy of the people there
are no laws of justice and mercy for those
who have lost the power of enforcing their
dictums our terms are more than gener-
ous

  yet you have said that it is the people
with whom we treat have we not the right
to present our side to the people your
party with the strange new weapons that
destroyed our guards have won it is true
but you are only a small portion of the
rebellion -  ad



people and number but a few thousand more
than our class there are many thousands
yes millions who were happy and contented
with our rule they were well treated they
were provided for they were happy and
satisfied with the treatment they received
i grant that we have been thoughtless and
often intolerant of the rights of the people
yet in the main we have acted for their good

jf you are sincere in your statements of
jl your purpose it is this great body of
the population who must decide the ques-
tion since it is they who gain or suffer most
from what we do here let them choose
their rulers

  no jon ley whispered in my ear
how will this be accomplished the
people must know the facts if they are to
come to an intelligent decision

  through the television the press and
the periodicals through speakers who
can present both sides to the people at
the end of three days we can receive their
verdict

  dont accede the old man begged
wait i said to him shaking of his
hand from my shoulder they are right
after all it is the people as a whole who are
most concerned and it is up to them to de-
cide remember we know little of the real
feelings of the people there are many
millions who have not joined us in our up-
rising we have had no way of knowing
how they regard us and even the poor-
est of the citizens must have his say in the
decision

  that is true master stele broke in
the people must decide but i have little
doubt of their decision and mede and
my other lieutenants voiced their agreement
with the scarred giant

  i turned back to the council

  we agree we will await the verdict of
the people and abide by their decision we
meet here at sunset on the third day

  the council departed in their blue flyers
and for a moment we stood watching the
great planes fade to specks in the sky old
jon ley shook his head sadly

  i am afraid my lad that all our efforts

have gone for nothing the council wins
the victory after all

  nonsense i cried the people are
ready for revolt you have told me they
have long awaited the master and we have
removed from them the menace of the
guards they will support us never fear
but right or wrong i will be no tyrant rul-
ing by force of arms alone our blow was
stiuck for the masses and the masses shall
decide

  well spoken jon leys face brighten-
ed but his brow still remained furrowed
yet i have many doubts the council
for all the decadence of their laws and the
softness of their living are very wise and
shrewd i am afraid their propaganda will
prove more powerful than even those guns
of yours they have in their favor the deep
inertia of the public and its apathy to sud-
den changes they may not look with fav-
or on your terms yet and his voice was
strengthened by a cheerful note there are
many thousands who will support us and
the men who fought for us today will be
icyal to the end we will hope that you
have decided for the best

  i thought the old man a prey to senile
fears for with the blind idealism of youth
i had boundless faith in the judgment of
the common people a faith that was shared
by stele and mede and the others but the
next seventy-two hours proved how right he
was-and how far from the truth our hopes
had been

  during the early hours our cause gained
momentum as the news of our victory spread
over the city riots of small dimensions
broke out in the other cities and the few
guards who were left of the councils forces
were busy keeping the peace all work in
chicago was at a standstill and there were
no guards in evidence our supporters
went about among the people stating our
plans and making converts to our cause
over the radio stations that had turned over
their programs to our speakers we out-
lined the terms as we had given them to the
council and presented our expectations of
the future

  then the councils efforts began to be
felt in the newspapers and periodicals


wonder stories

  and over the television they pleaded their
  cause they openly admitted their past
  mistakes and promised a rosy future in
  atonement they would lessen the restric-
  tions and the laws while unpopular ones
  would be repealed higher wages shorter
  hours and more freedom would be enjoyed
  by all the council would be enlarged to
  include elected representatives from the
  people

   and many were the doubts cast upon my
 leadership by their secret agents who ming-
 led with the people in the homes and the
 smaller gatherings how did anyone know
 that i was truly a man from the past might
 i not be a clever impostor who sought to
 gain control of the world would they be
 better off under the absolute control of one
 man than under the benevolent and pater-
 nal rule of a council that included their
 own representatives surely the old or-
 der with its promised new freedom was
 better than an unknown and untried plan
 that would disorganize society and bring
 ciieos

 slowly the tide of public opinion
 swung toward the council long be-
 fore the allotted time was up i knew that
 the old man had been right in his estimate
 of the power of the councils propaganda
 yet i was not sorry forcing my rule on
 an unwilling or skeptical public would have
 been neither practical nor consistent with
 the ideals of liberty

    at sunset on the third day we met the
 council in the plaza as we lighted from
 a plane duse ley leda and myself we
 heard the sound of singing in the distance
 down one of the broad avenues between the
 towering pyramided buildings came my
  army chanting the song of the new day
 at their head marched stele and mede and
 beside them a man carrying a tattered flag
 nailed to a shaft of a spear then the rif-
 lemen led by sale and after them the men
 with their spears led by gore and wolf
 and bringing up the rear marched other
 men women and children a lump rose
 in my throat as they grouped themselves in
 one corner of the square these people
 would be loyal whatever happened

  the council arrived and a steady stream
of people filled the plaza except for the
open space in the center where we stood i
looked abount the milling sea of faces
tightly massed and strangely silent the
leader of the council advanced towards me
and his face was triumphant

  the hour of the judgment has come
he said

  i nodded saying nothing in reply

  he turned to the crowd and raised a hand
for silence

  representatives of the people of chicago
you have come here this day to render your
decision shall you be ruled by the master
and his forces he broke off for a mo-
ment and from the corner where my forces
stood came a shout the master and
voices began the chant which was quickly
hushed as he again raised his hand or
is it your wish he continued to cling
loyally to the council

  the council-it came in a great shout
from the throats of the elected representa-
tives of the blue clad followers it was
taken up by the masses and hurled back in
a torrent of sound by millions of voices
the council we choose the council

  he turned to me and spoke above the din
of the shouting

  you are satisfied

  the people have decided i said and
so be it but do not forget that we are still
the actual masters of the city we shall
not imperil your reign so long as you keep
the promises that you have made them but
there is yet the question of my people

  the great crowd was dwindling going
back to take up their accustomed routine
but those who had brought about the revo-
lution who had kept alive the traditions of
freedom and equality through the centuries
of oppression remained in a compact body
waiting my word a mad thought surged
through my brain it was not yet too late
to grasp the reins of power with our
weapons we could destroy the councilors
overawe the people and-but i stilled the
thought and turned again to the leader who
had been joined by other members of the
council

  you realize i said that we could yet
rebellion -  a d



enforce our will upon you in spite of the
judgment of the people we have no wish
to do that but there was to be an alterna-
tive

  what is that

  we will go leaving you in peace to rule
the five cities as you see fit do not for-
get however that we have taught the people
the lesson of revolt against oppression and
see that you do not give them cause to re-
peat it with more disastrous results had
we wished red riot would have shaken the
city to its foundations

  but what are your demands he per-
sisted

  we and all those of the five cities who
are loyal to us will depart to establish a
new nation far from here we are to go
unmolested and you will supply us with
planes to carry us and with materials food
clothing tools-all of the essentials for
founding a new city the secret of the
guns will go with us

  they conferred together for a little time
at last the leader came over to where i

stood with my friends

  it is agreed we will supply you with
whatever you wish when will you go

  in one week

  and seven days later with leda by my
side our plane led the great fleet of ships
from the city fifteen thousand loyal men
their wives and families and all of their
possessions followed us in great air liners
and behind them came huge transport
planes carrying chemicals machinery tools
and everything needed to establish a high-
ly civilized community

  so we took off into the unknown unex-
plored world leaving the five cities and
their teeming millions to stagnate as they
would in every heart and brain was the
determination to establish a new progres-
sive nation where all men were equal and
all mens efforts were bent on making their
best contribution to the welfare of society

  the land of our goal was the re-born
continent of atlantis where in the ancient
cradle of civilization we hoped to found
our new republic

foreword

the following narrative offers as enter-
tainment an introduction to the highly
interesting problems of the space flight
it is especially aimed at the reader who is
not technically trained the mathemati-
cal parts however are based on careful
calculation of course considerable time
must still pass before
we shall possess rock-
et ships so well con-
structed that we shall
be able to venture a
flight to a neighboring
planet the rocket
ship will first have to
stand its test on the
earth yet it is well
to keep the distant
goal in sight even if
we are still just mak-
ing a beginning tow-

  tom sacket chief
correspondent of the
sunday globe had
pulled out his pad of
paper like lightning

but in his hand his
pen trembled a little

  accustomed as he
was to recording the
most hair-raising sen-
sational reports in al-
most impossible posi-
tions without the
twitching of an eye-
lash his calmness had
deserted him this time

it was only with diffi-
culty that he overcame
his excitement never-
theless his words were filled with a warm
emotion such as one feels toward dear peo-
ple who are still standing before one in the
abounding freshness of life but who are to
depart the next moment perhaps for ever

  have you actually considered every-
thing he asked the engineer

  this question is idle my dear fellow
even a person who intends to pay a visit to

our old moon does not omit to think and
plan but the trip to the moon compared
to ours is like a morning walk compared
with crossing africa barefoot

  then you intend to go further than-
tom sacket with staring eyes stopped in the
middle of the sentence

   certainly

                    then you are not
                  going to the moon at
                  all

                     oh yes for we un-
                     fortunately have to use
                     it as a filling station
                     why do you think
                     that-

                   we do not think
                 anything wre know
                 that on the moon there
                 is to be found what we
                 need in order to pro-
                 duce our fuel by means
                 of solar power there
                 is ice which we shall
                 decompose electrolyti-
                 cally into its compon-
                 ents hydrogen and
                 oxygen

                    i wonder whether
                  everything will work
                  out as you think

                        it must for other-
                     wise we cannot get
                     back again

                     tom sacket let the
                   pad sink a moment
                   and looked at the floor
                   then he pulled him-
                   self together and
                   looked into the clear
                   blue eyes of the engin-
                   eer who stood before
                   him like a giant

  i was going to ask you much more-
but i cannot not now in this hour in the
space ship which will in a few minutes
carry you so far away from our native plan-
et whatever your destination may be
whether the red glowing star of the war god
or shining venus i wish you from my heart
the best of success good luck for starting
and for landing

         valier was nois
  v only one of the most
  distinguished of the ger-
  man rocket experimenters
  and enthusiasts but also
  the first man to give his
  life to rocketry his death
  in the summer of  oc-
  curring by an explosion of
  an oxygen tank during a
  test was a great blow to
  the rocket pioneers but it
  is to be hoped that the ex-
  ample of valiers enthusi-
  asm and energy animates
  those who are carrying on
  where he left off

    the present story was
  written shortly before his
  death and contains many
  of his ideas about the in-
  terplanetary journey which
  have never appeared in
  print in english valiers
  command of the interplan-
  etary problem is evident
  throughout this realistic
  tale and his ingenuity in
  mastering the difficulties
  of space flight is remark-
  able we take great pleas-
  ure in presenting this story
  to our readers as a pro-
  phetic glimpse into the fu-
  ture by a courageous and
  inspired man


wonde-l stories

  you have guessed our plan that is a
good omen if your good wishes come true
we shall meet again in two years when the
earth has returned for the second time to
that point in its orbit from which we are
now starting but now i must really ask
you to leave the ship we must get ready
for the trip-we must undress ourselves and
get into the spring hammocks

  oh yes we have to travel nearly naked
for during the start even the lightest cloth-
ing is as heavy as sheet platinum to be
sure all of us the doctor my wife and i
have been tested in the centrifugal machine
for ten times the terrestrial gravity but as
far as possible we want to make the activity
of heart and lungs easy

  what your wife is go-
ing with you

  somebody must do the
housekeeping even in the
rocket that is not work
for men and then who
knows whether other
planets are not perhaps
inhabited she would
surely not want me to
succumb to the entice-
ments of the beautiful
dwellers in other worlds

in space

  re you ready

  l we start in  sec-
onds

  two voices answered in the affirmative
you already know the plans by heart
first sixteen seconds with only  meters
acceleration until we have gradually pene-
trated the dense air then the gas lever
over to the middle point until at 
meters above sea level we have reached the
velocity of  meters a second  sec-
onds after starting when we are in airless
space then full gas for all the ex-
hausts as much as the machine and our
hearts will stand so that we can get
through the zone of the earths gravitation

  yes children we must cover the distance
to the moon at an extreme speed in order

to make up for the day lost by yesterdays
delay otherwise we shall miss the con-
nection with mars and all our painfully
worked calculations would be in vain in-
stead of taking  hours we shall reach the
moon in  hours

  hello still  seconds have you the
hypodermic needles then use them with-
out delay so that the lobelia solution will
have still  seconds to circulate thoroughly
through the blood and now breathe deep-
ly and just think of one thing not to stop
breathing-still  seconds count with
me now

  a blast shook the air a mighty train
of fire shot like a comet up toward the
vault of the night sky
and before the few favor-
ed ones who knew about
the ascent and were al-
lowed to witness the start
were aware of it the
shining ship had vanished
among the stars

  silently the people
went away most of them
slowly as though the
force of the ascent were
weighing upon them on-
ly one had regained his
mobility this was tom
sacket who like a true
acrobat of the pen was
hastily writing his ideas
on paper regardless of
the jouncing of the car
in order that he might wire them to his
paper at midnight from the nearest tele-
graph station he could not help thinking
oi the brave charming little woman who
in order not to have her husband go alone
was risking all the dangers of space

	  

  at the same second that sackets car had
to stop at a railroad crossing the space
ship at a height of  kilometers above
the surface of the earth had attained the
unheard-of-velocity of  meters a sec-
ond now the screw of the automatic reg-
ulator pushed back the lever which con-
trolled the flow of fuel to the rocket this

acceleration of  feet per second per second

arrangement regulating the calculated start
automatically at the same time permitting
the hand of man to intervene in case of
need had stood the test thus every un-
necessary motion every lifting of the hand
or moving f the arm was avoided and
the apparatus did its duty from second to
second the acceleration decreased  of a
meter being now equivalent to six times
the pull of the earths gravitation and thus
the hearts as well as the entire bodies of
the occupants adopted themselves gradual-
ly to the state of complete weightlessness
which followed

  the actual start had been successful
without any pressing in of the nose of the
ship by air resistance or bulging of the
walls due to friction or excessive heating
oi the ship as a matter of fact only such
an excellent material as beryllium which
had very recently come into industrial use
could have satisfied these demands for
lightness hardness and smoothness every
gram of this rare metal however had cost
a full mark

  all the data of importance regarding the
start the flight acceleration the perform-
ance of the rocket the consumption of fuel
the external and internal temperatures and
pressures were indicated by self-register-
ing instruments the desolation and empti-
ness of the long flight through space which
was before the voyagers would afford op-
portunity enough to study and evaluate
these curves

  one of us may now sleep six hours
said the engineer turning to his compan-
ions without as yet rising from his ham-
mock two of us will always be on duty
twelve hours at a time we cannot man-
age otherwise for it is dangerous to leave
one all alone not alone for physical but
also for psychical reasons

  who knows what effect the cosmic
short-wave radiations may have upon the
mind whoever finds it his turn to sleep
will just stay in bed the other two will
dress and try to get around as well as
possible with the aid of the iron-shod shoes
metal insertions in the clothing and the
electromagnetic carpet on the floor because

here gravity has for the time being ceased
to exist

  we have noticed that was the reply as
if from one mouth

the lot for sleeping fell to the doctor
the trusted  assistant of the engineer
so inge made herself ready and floated like
an angel up to her husband who had taken
the pilots place in the upper part of the
ship as yet she was not wearing the
sandals with iron soles on her pretty feet
and she would have bumped her head
against the ceiling of the room if her hus-
band had not caught her in time with two
fingers just as one catches a bit of down
which is hovering in the air

  i will connect the magnets so that we
can sit side by side the way we are accus-
tomed to do on earth

  yes do it edmund for with the best
will in the world i cannot get used to being
an angel living outside the limits of time
and space but it is fine after all it is
as blissful as though we were falling in
dreams from one world into worlds more
and more beautiful

  we are indeed falling in fact at the
enormous speed of about  meters a
second at present though to be sure falling
upward but this velocity will soon lessen
for the gigantic arm of terrestrial gravita-
tion is still reaching out for us and draw-
ing us back to the earth but all the power
of the earth cannot entirely destroy our tre-
mendous speed

  for a while the two were silent as yet
not a quarter of an hour had passed since
the moment of starting but the time seem-
ed to them like an eternity this is a
phenomenon which the passenger of the
lufthansa becomes acquainted with when
he soars over land and sea in a great tri-
motor plane an hour in a plane seems
longer than three hours in an express train

  already the first shade of boredom was
beginning to settle upon the couple when
inge started up with a cry of surprise like
a red glowing torch a gigantic arc of
light appeared at the edge of the black
disc which was the earth which stood out


lwonder stories

among the constellations the arc increased
every second in luminosity

  finally the fiery red light changed into
a rosy veil which struggled with shadows
edged in blue and reached out like the
jaws of pincers until a full half-circle was
filled but at this moment there appeared
so dazzling a light that inge had to close
her eyes in order not to be blinded

  she did not venture to look out again
until her husband had pushed the dark
glasses over her eyes meanwhile the pic-
ture had changed quickly as a clear
brightly illuminated crescent the earth
stood in the window of the space ship sur-
rounded by an aureole of changing color-
ed lights the atmosphere gleaming in the
brilliance of the sun

  in the other window there appeared at
the same time the image of the bright silver
moon which was illuminated a little beyond
its first quarter with a flight of  hours
piojected it had unfortunately been im-
possible to make the start from the earth
by day

  after all it was necessary to direct the
flight by the moon which is most favor-
able for the start to mars when it is on
the increase as seen from earth and 
degrees before its full illumination because
from that position an extremely favorable
elliptical path leads to the red star of the
war god in relatively short travelling time

  thus it was unfortunately necessary to
give up the real view of the sunny side of
their native planet and content themselves
with seeing the earth in the form of a huge
crescent with an edge shading into twilight
slowly moving in the constellations of the
zodiac from the decrease of the angular
diameter of the earth measured from the
horns or ends of the crescent the distance
of the space ship from the center of the
earth could at any time be secured and by
comparison of the measuyments taken from
time to time with the sextant the velocity of
flight could also be determined the same
measurements on the diameter of the moon
served to check data on the approach of
the ship to the earths satellite

  at last twelve hours had passed since
the start at the first change of watches

 after six hours inge had endeavored to
 erve as hostess though not without some
 trouble in accustoming herself to the con-
 dition of weightlessness to be sure there
 was no need to worry about breaking dishes
 or glasses if they were dropped they re-
 mained floating freely in the air of the
 room and could only be held fast by the
 electromagnetic table top because of their
 iron inlays

   unfortunately the magnetism could not
 be extended to the food and drink the
 morsels had actually to be juggled in or-
 der to get them to the mouth on the other
 hand drinking out of bottles with the aid
 of straws offered no special difficulties
 now the second time everything went much
 better after that inge withdrew for the
 third watch fell to the two men while the
 engineer had slept during the second one
 for the landing maneuver on the moon
 at the nineteenth hour they were all to be
 at their posts in full complement

chapter ii
nearing the moon

 t eally we have all been frivolous

   jtl concluded the engineer when he had
 received the report of the previous watch
 we have not bothered at all about shoot-
 ing stars and meteors but have allowed the
 lord to watch out that none of these cos-
 mic blocks of metal burn a hole in the cov-
 ering of our ship to be sure we have rub-
 ber patches and fasteners at hand to be
 able to close the leak as quick as light-

	ning

   but to speak frankly i do not think
 we should be able to get around to doing
 that unless we were to sit here all the time
 in our space diving suits for if the hole
 in the wall is of any size then the air would
 escape from the room too quickly even
 the automatic ventilators will not be able
 to keep up the air pressure until the leak
 is mended and anybody in the room where
 the catastrophe occurs will die for his
 veins will burst if the pressure sinks below
 one third of an atmosphere besides that
 there is the cooling of the gases to far be-
a daring trip to mars



 low zero on account of the rapid expan-
 sion

  fine prospects those replied the doc-
tor is what people would say on the earth
if this was explained there for the first
time but we have considered all these
things a hundred times already and have
just accepted them

  i do not see why we should not be able
to get out of the way since the ship obeys
the steering gyroscope so well and the ex-
hausts ignite in a fraction of a second
said inge with energetic decision she was
already in her hammock

  but my dear child what is the use of all
that if we could see the approaching
meteor in time we could do something
why cant we see it

  if we all three lay day and night at the
telescopes like setters out hunting per-
haps we could but that cannot be done
and even if it could all the meteors would
escape us which were not in the limited
field of vision of the telescopes with the
naked eye recognition of them is impossible
further remember that our highest veloc-
ity is  meters a second while meteors
in crossing the orbit of the earth are known
to possess velocities of  to 
meters a second

  one second before collision meteor and
ship are therefore still  to  kilometers
apart how is one then even with a keen
telescope to perceive the body which per-
haps is only a few decimeters or centimeters
in diameter which neither glows nor shines
in the cold airless space apart from the tiny
bit of sunlight it reflects

  in fact we can do nothing madam ex-
cept trust in god if chance or destiny
wills it we shall be struck or we shall
emerge uninjured from this cosmic drum
fire which doubtless even now is invisibly
going on every hour and minute about us
in my opinion it is just the large meteors
which we have to fear least because they
are the rarest

  but it would be bad if we got into a
thick swarm of very tiny meteoric bodies as
if into a sandstorm then certainly we
would be lost for these little particles
would act on our ship like a sand blast

and would grind off the outer skin as though
on a grindstone until the covering burst
and the inner ship also was finally ruined

  my greatest concern is whether the in-
sulating stratum of ozone which is between
the double walls of our cabin in order to
check the deadly short-wave gamma rays of
space would prove effective that too is
quite aside from the powerful ultra-violet
rays which alone would completely burn
up the body

  the window panes cast in jena out of a
specially designed glass have certainly stood
the test excellently as well as the complete
system for artificial renewal of air from

looked around the narrow but comfortable
room in which every single thing however
tiny had its purpose and was absolutely
necessary

  before i go to sleep now dont you
want to take a little walk outside the ship
in the brand new space suits the doctor
nodded affirmatively then a bell sounded

  that is the signal that we have passed
the limit of gravity between the earth and
the moon now we have been en route 
hours and  minutes the time agrees
tolerably well with the calculation the
velocity amounts to about  meters a
second too much for the start of our fall
to the moon it will have to be braked
considerably i could start that right now
but to shorten the flight let us keep on to
 kilometers above the surface of the
moon our four exhaust brakes will stop
us all right even then

in fact without that signal which was
given by an ingenious selenium photo-
electric televisor as soon as the disk of
the moon enlarged beyond a certain size on
the projection surface which corresponded
to the previously calculated distance of the
point free from gravitation they would not
have noticed at all that the ship had now
passed from the sphere of influence of the
earth into that of its satellite

  it is just in this point that previous novel-
ists have made so many errors the pres-
sure of gravity does not gradually decrease
between the start from the earth to the point


wonder stories

free from gravity so that the occupants
feel lighter and lighter from hour to hour
until they float about entirely weightless
at the moment when the ship passes the
limit of gravitation

 on the contrary all pressure ceases for
them at that moment a slight distance above
the earth when the rocket is shut off it
begins again only when the pilot sets the
engines in operation in some direction of
flight

  it is equally wrong to maintain that the
ship on passing the limit of gravitation
turns around of its own accord and now
turns its bottom toward the moon so that
in consequence the ideas of above and be-
low are changed for the occupants

  even the ideas of up and down have lost
their significance for the occupants at only
 kilometers above the sea level coin-
cident with the disappearance of the pres-
sure of gravity neither the earth nor the
moon is then above or below they float
the same as the ship in space simply ahead
 behind to the right or the left

  the doctor had already opened the cup-
board in which the space suits were stored
but the engineer shook his head and went
on turning to his wife just sleep calmly
my child we will remain here and turn
around the ship so that the exhaust end will
be directed toward the moon then we will
get out the large distance measurer for
we can no longer measure with the sextant
when so close to the moon i think you
will have only about five hours sleep for
we are arriving rather earlier than the cal-
culation indicated but in this case it does
no harm

  inge switched off the light in her berth
and drew over her head a light downy cover-
let to hasten the coming of sleep she
pressed a button which caused to flow tow-
ard her a slightly narcotizing gas whicr
the travellers through space called sleeping
gas of course the gas flowed only for an
automatically regulated time- in order not
to have a bad effect upon the respiration

  meanwhile the two men set to work
since there was nothing else to be feared
the doctor took the pilots seat and started
the gyroscope whose rotation by the re-

sulting momentum of revolution forced the
entire hull of the ship to turn slowly in the
opposite direction until the bow pointed al-
most exactly toward the earth while the
exhaust end pointed to the moon mean-
while the engineer climbed down into the
lower room in order to convince himself
about the condition of the tanks and their
contents the ship carried fuel in immense
quantities while the oxygen necessary for
combustion was kept separate the com-
position was still the secret of the inventor

  the total load of fuel was of such an
amount that on being burned all in succes-
sion in airless and weightless space working
only against the mass inertia of the ship it-
self it could have imparted to the latter a
final velocity of  meters a second
in technical language that is called the
ideal propulsion

  this measurement number is the most im-
portant of all for it determines the radius
of action of the space ship since every speci-
fied trip in space after careful calculation
expresses by this single number the ideal
propulsion necessary for its accomplishment

for landing

for the ascent from the earth the ship
had already used up about  met-
ers a second of its propulsion possibility
only  meters a second were lerft for
braking the fall toward the moon this had
to suffice to overcome the field of gravity
of the moon equivalent to  meters a
second plus the power to brake the tre-
mendous velocity with which the ship had
just shot past the limit of gravity

  regarding the amount of fuel still on
hsnd the engineer was naturally informed
beforehand for an indicator which could
bo read from the pilots seat showed at
every moment the condition of the tanks
likewise manometers and thermometers
showed the pressures and internal tempera-
tures in the different containers

  the engineers one anxiety was concerned
with the parts of the ships motor which
were necessarily exposed to the airless and
cold interplanetary space that is to say
the exhausts the rocket explosion chambers
a daring trip to mars



and the vaporizers and spark plugs pro-
jecting into them without interference all
these parts would have cooled off when
the rockets were shut off nearly down to
the temperature of space that is to below
 degrees below zero centigrade

  there was danger that they would split
if the combustion chambers cracked at all
due to the sudden change in temperature
failure here would mean certain death
through the smashing of the ship when it
struck the surface of the moon with twice
the speed of the shell of a cannon

  the walls of the exhausts like all the met-
al parts of the ship involving high tempera-
tures requiring at the same time great
smoothness and hardness were made of
beryllium this metal had in addition to
the favorable properties of duralumin also
the advantages mentioned and besides that
of a specific gravity one-third smaller the
actual walls of the chambers were made of
quartz glass blown in one piece

  to protect all these delicate parts against
extreme cooling the engineer had made a
very ingenious arrangement the same
system of coils which served for circulating
the cooling material during the operation
of the rockets now had passing through it
some warming material preheated in a spec-
ial boiler so that the temperature of the
endangered parts could not fall below a
certain point for this jeason the rockets
could not be shut off suddenly nor could
full gas be given instantaneously

  carefully the engineer tested every part
of the machinery the pumps the valves
everything down to the smallest screw
that this was no trifling task is known to
anyone who has ever had to go over a twelve-
cylinder airplane motor what are called
cylinders in that case were here twelve
rocket chambers arranged in star form about
the main axis of the ship each of them open-
ing out into an exhaust composed of seven
hexagons again arranged in a star shape

  thus the hours in the engine room passed
quickly for the man who in the pilots seat
took observations on the approaching moon
he did this partly to fulfill his duty and
partly also for his own pleasure to pass
the time he used the great telescope which

was built into the main axis of the ship al-
ways pointing directly along the line of
flight and which gave an enlargement of
 times since the ship in the course
of these hours had descended from about

	kilometers to about  kilomet-
ers above the surface of the moon he saw
the landscapes below him in the telescope
as clearly as though they appeared to the
naked eye at heights ranging  to  kilo-
meters

  by using the micrometer built into the tube
tv take angular measurements of the little
crater of triesnecker whose diameter was
well known from the measurements made
by terrestrial observatories and by using as
a check the distance apart of two tiny crat-
ers between triesnecker and hyginus he
got by readings every five minutes the exact
distance of the ship from the moon by
calculation he also got the velocity at each
time this was now increasing every min-
ute

  quickly there passed the last hour the
eighteenth since the start from the earth
in the next thirty minutes everything was
to be settled life or death it all de-
pended on whether the landing was success-
ful or not there was no third possibility
if there was the slightest failure then there
was not the remotest and dimmest hope of
survival

in climbing up from the engine room the
engineer had wakened his wife with a
kiss and had then taken the pilots seat
while the doctor took a place at the left
inge floated up to the men and seated her-
self at the right of her husband at first
she was much astonished that she no longer
saw the moon through the forward win-
dows for the doctor had imperceptibly
turned the ship while she was asleep now
the crescent of the earth appeared in the
uppermost window of the dome a splendid
sight about four times as large as the cres-
cent of the new moon appears on earth

  the great telescope was no longer used
for examining the moon the smaller tel-
escopes enlarging twelve times were suf-
ficient for the purpose nearer and nearer
came the satellite but it no longer looked


wonder stories

as though the ship were falling upon it
it seemed as though the moon were floating
forward like a golden iceberg on the in-
visible tide of the ether a demon lying in
wait for them the approach of the globe
shining in the sunlight had something piti-
less and devastating about it

  it is like a sea of glass blended with
fire said inge softly to herself without
expecting a reply like a monster with a
hundred eyes on all sides which is rising
before the throne and about the throne of
the infinite as is written in the apocalypse
of st john the seer of patmos

  with magic power the moon drew the
glances of the men they had to teai
themselves away from the view of the hor-
rible wilderness of its crater fields every
few moments to look at the indicators of
ttie measuring instruments on the dashboard
finally the engineer broke the silence

  children it is getting time to prepare
for landing so be quick my dear and get
into your hammock take off all the blank-
ets and any superfluous clothing we shall
have to brake sharply and this time the
pressure will strike us like a bullet even if
in the absolute sense it will not be quite as
strong as at the start on the other hand
for eighteen hours we have been unaccus-
tomed to the normal terrestrial gravity and
even that would now seem an unusual bur-
den

  as obediently as a child inge withdrew
tc her berth and obeyed instructions like-
wise the men took off their clothing so far
as was necessary the engineer examined
his muscles tentatively their development
was due to diligent practice in gymnastics
and carefully planned training in boxing

  now we must give the old moon the
knock-out this will not be so easy be-
cause for landing on it there is no possibil-
ity of using the automatic regulator of the
lever it will be necessary to throw the
gas lever by our own muscular force and
that after a lightning-like decision as the
emergency demands

  this with the quadrupled pressure will
demand at least as much expenditure of
force as if one tried to hold up a hundred
pounds in one hand if only our nerve

responses do not fail edmund to be
frank at the start i was somewhat stupe-
fied and i was glad that the automatic de-
vice took care of the gas regulation so per-
fectly

  yes it is no joke to speed toward such
a wall of armor as the crater-pierced moon
at a speed of  meters a second re-
member that the speed with which the nerves
conduct the visual stimulus to the brain and
the command to the arm muscles amounts
to hardly more than  meters a second
but now there is no more time to be lost
do not forget the injection called the
doctor to inge while he inserted the hypo-
dermic and the engineer did the same

  the latter allowed thirty seconds to
elapse in order to give the drug time to be
imparted to the body then he asked
briefly all ready

         chapter iii
         on the moon

the distance from the moon had mean-
while lessened to about  kilometers
while the velocity of fall was almost 
meters a second then the engineer reach-
ed out for the gas lever and pressed his foot
on the starter

  at once there was a buzzing sound in the
ship the pumps began to operate and
forced the liquid fuel into the vaporizers
now a pressure on the lever switched on the
ignition at this moment an invisible veil
seemed to be cast over the occupants for
an instant their brains seemed to cease func-
tioning it was the coming of the pressure
small though perceptible the engineer was
the first to recover himself

  the transition from no gravity to a
slight amount is always the worst and the
body will endure better the increasing of
a sensation already present turning to
inge he went do not worry my child we
are ourselves again and i feel strong
enough to strangle a lion

  meanwhile the indicators of the measuring
apparatus had begun to operate they
were attentively observed by the doctor
who had to see that the heating gas was
removed at the right time and cooling mater-
a daring trip to mars



ial provided instead in proportion as the
internal temperature of the quartz wall of
th combustion chambers rose to a white
heat

  the chambers are warm he reported
now you can give gas as you please ed-
mund the latter called back in a loud
voice so that inge heard it above the hum
of the motors

  pay attention i am now braking in the
first stage with a maximum of  meters a
second retardation in order to reduce the
fall toward the moon from  meters a
second to  meters a second in exactly
one minute now

  if anybody could have seen the ship from
the outside at this moment he would have
noticed that in a sudden flame it shot a
brilliant train of fire toward the moon this
lasted exactly  seconds then the blaze
disappeared but it was replaced by the
emerging from the ship at a right angle to
the axis of a symmetrical tube looking
like the eyes of a snail with spherical knobs
on the ends shining with lenses

  the engineer had put out the great dis-
tance-measurer for the telescopes were no
longer sufficient in this case when it was
a question of checking the plunge to the
moon to a fine point with both eyes at
the instrument he could see the surface of
the moon run like a speeding locomotive
through the distance marks of the stereo-
scopically acting tube which were in the field
of vision and could calculate from the time
between one mark and another the velocity
at the moment the doctor announced by
way of checking the observations  kilo-
meters above the moon velocity of 
meters a second as the result of the first
stage of braking

  that agrees approximately replied the
engineer the small difference from my
reading is insignificant the chief speed of
fall is checked now i shall allow us to
fall to  kilometers above the moon dur-
ing which our velocity will again increase
a few meters a second and then ill brake
in the second stage to  meters a second

  and so it happened the exhausts did

  deceleration of  feet per second per sec-
ond	

their duty the distance measurer showed
only  kilometers of height above the
moon when the maneuver was finished
then the engineer turned to the doctor

  now we can take in the great distance
measurer so that it will not be injured on
landing

  the latter quickly executed this

  then the engineer for the third time threw
in the lever and checked the ship  meters
above the moon so that it neither rose nor
fell from there he gently allowed it to
float down and deposited it finally on the
surface of the moon with a gentle impact

  that was a master work no less than
that of the valiant man at krupps who made
the head of the huge steam hammer come
down so accurately on the emperors gold
watch without injuring it that it could not
be pulled out was the praise of the doc-
tor while inge rewarded her husband with
a kiss

hardly had the latter convinced him-
self that the ship was resting on solid
ground then he was already slipping into
the space suit

  this was provided on a small scale with
all the equipment of the cabin ie with ap-
paratus for artificial breathing electric heat-
ing insulation against radiation by means
of a coating soaked in various preparations
and telephone wires for speaking across the
airless space bowie knife axe hatchet
and spade as well as the inevitable repeat-
ing pistol were of course provided even
though there was no expectation of hostile
inhabitants in a special carrier there were
stowed scientific registering apparatus in
such a way that they could at any moment
come into action

  the doctor helped inge into her diving
helmet

  then the two climbed in turn into the
air-lock chamber and left the ship in the
same manner as is done in submarines under
water even though the diving equipment
weighed a hundred pounds according to ter-
restrial weight it was easy to endure with
the gravity of the moon only a sixth as
great

  the engineer had judged correctly for


wonder stories

the ground on which the space ship had
landed consisted of ice whether the entire
surface of the moon was formed of the same
substance could not be determined from
here 

  but that does not matter to us he called
into the telephone by which he was con-
nected with his wife and the doctor who
was remaining on board as a guard here
we have what we want now be quick get
out the solar power apparatus and send it
down to us from the air-lock by the crane
we must utilize every hour

  the tanks of the space ship which was
built for an ideal propulsion power of -

	meters a second had been almost entire-
ly emptied by this excessively fast trip at a
prodigious speed the power of 
meters a second had been consumed by the
ascent from the earth to the weightless
point and the power of almost  meters
a second had gone to the braking maneuvers
in landing on the moon

  since a one-way direct flight from the
earth to mars on the chosen ellipse would
have required about  meters a second
without taking account of any steering man-
euvers a trip to this planet with the given
engine power would have been impossible
it was another matter if the moon could
be used as an intermediate station then
the ship starting from the moon for mars
had only to overcome the moons field of
gravity produce the excess of parabolic
velocity at the moons height in the earths
field and finally the acceleration for getting
into the kepler path to mars  all of this
amounted to an ideal propulsion of 
meters a second leaving of the  met-
ers a second available the amount of 
for maneuvering on the trip to mars

  a few hours later the little power sta-
tion was in operation a huge parabolic
mirror buiit of light sheet silver collected
the intense heat of the sun and first melted
a small amount of ice in a closed container
the water thus formed-which cannot exist
free on the airless moon-was heated to
boiling and provided the steam for a little
turbine this was connected with a gen-
erator of electric energy whose current was

 used for the electrolytic dissociation of melt-
 ed ice in special containers

   the entire system was of such dimensions
 that in four terrestrial days it would exact-
 ly fill the tanks of the ship with liquid hy-
 drogen and oxygen in the right proportions

the second lap

 therefore they had to remain this
 length of time on the moon while the
 power plant operated automatically na-
 turally the travellers used this time for
 making cosmic studies and for investigating
 the surface of the moon it was sufficient
 for only one person to remain on guard in
 the ship at all times

   substances directly serviceable or valua-
 ble were indeed not found on the moon but
 the doctor who had taken his degree in
 both medicine and chemistry came on the
 trail of an important discovery when the
 short-wave gamma radiations of space were
 concentrated in the shadow of the crater
 wall where the sun did not reach by direct-
 ing a parabolic mirror toward the milky
 way he found that the rate of decomposi-
 tion of radioactive substances of which a
 few samples had been taken along w-as
 considerably accelerated and in fact regu-
 lated according to desire

   this experiment would never have suc-
 ceeded on the earth to whose surface there

	penetrates only the radiation filtered by the
 air it indicated the initial step in the
 technically controlled demolition of atoms
 and the obtaining of the enormous energy
 latent in the breaking up of matter

   here we have the key to the real shlji
 of the future he explained impressively
 to inge who had followed his experiments
 with astonished eyes our present rock-
 ets which simply operate by the energy of
 detonating explosives i e through the de-
 composition and rebuilding of molecules
 are poor weak little machines which can
 hardly accelerate us to the velocity of 
 kilometers a second which is necessary in
 order to leave the solar system that feat
 will only be possible with ether ships which
 hurl the split-off electrons of crushed atoms
a daring trip to mars



out of cathode tubes with almost the speed
of light

  those tubes will take the place of our
exhausts of course such ships can only
set out from the airless moon never froni
the air-wrapped earth therefore the ex-
plosion rockets will be used to get us to
the moon the ether ships themselves with
an easily endurable acceleration of only 
meters a second a second will be able in
the course of a half year to reach the velo-
city of light at full speed such a ship
would then cover the distance from the earth
to the moon which took us  hours in less
than y hours and to neptune in 
hours it would even offer the possibility
of reaching the neighboring fixed stars
such as alpha centauri sirius and pro-
cyon which according to current figures
of astronomers are   and  light
years away from us

  inge listened intently to these high-flown
plans for the future they were full of
credulous confidence in the power of the
human mind which before her very eyes
had just completed its mightiest feat by
reaching the moon

  thus the four days passed quickly and
the time came to dismount the power plant
and to stow the parts again in the space
ship

  now i will quickly try to fulfill your
request inge said the engineer turning
to his little wife just as she was starting
to hand the men their last breakfast on the
moon you wanted so much to send a few
farewell greeting to our old earth it can-
not be done by radio for it is not even
certain on the one hand whether the waves
used by our terrestrial stations today are
those necessary for wireless communication
via space and on the other hand the ap-
paratus necessary would have been far too
heavy to bring along but the trick can be
done by the solar mirror previously i
could not put it at your disposal until i
was sure that the power plant would really
fill our tanks in the calculated time

  frau inge filled the mens cups by pour-
ing-a thing possible to travellers through
space only during a stop at a heavenly body

of sufficient force of attraction the doc-
tor took up the conversation

  the mirror has done its work splendid-
ly our tanks and all the reserve con-
tainers are filled to bursting but now we
have still six hours before the calculated
moment of starting we need three hours
for taking apart and stowing away the mach-
ine and so we have three for fulfilling
inges wishes

  i am childishly glad of that but i by
no means understand how you are actually
going to do it for after all the parabolic
mirror collects the rays arriving parallel
in its focal line but here it is the same
idea as with an automobile light of sending
a parallel pencil of rays into space in the
opposite direction from a source of light

ggttow cleverly you speak as a mat-

  j-jl ter of fact we shall have to change
the mirror which was built for this before-
hand and stretch it out flat as a plane mir-
ror this can be done quickly by adjusting
its framework then we will simply catch
the sunlight with it and flash it like a win-
dow on a mountainside on earth to our nat-
ive planet

  on earth my friend the peissenberg as-
tronomer is already on the watch for it
before starting i gave him an exact des-
cription of our plans in a sealed letter and
informed him that if it were at all possible
we would signal five hours before our indi-
cated starting time from the moon to mars
the time is also favorable because the mir-
ror thanks to its elevated position is in the
sunlight while the district for a great dis-
tance around is still buried in the pitch-
black shadow of the crater walls

  on the bright background of the moon
our mirror-light could presumably not be
seen from the earth or its discovery would
at least be very difficult but in the pitch-
black shadow the bright flash will very pro-
bably be recognizable by swinging the
mirror on its own axis we can give at will
long and short light signals and communi-
cate in the morse code

  an hour later all three were at work in-
forming their friend on the earth of the re-
sults of the trip thus far and their future


wonder stories

prospects and intentions they gave the
signals in rapid succession repeating each
sentence for security all this went smooth-
ly only it was uncertain whether the obser-
ver on the earth had clear weather for recep-
tion on the other hand it might well be
assumed that he would have notified other
observatories in case he had bad weather

  finally the report was sent that at an
exact time after leaving the moon when the
ship as viewed from the earth would be a
certain number of degrees in a certain di-
rection from the disk of the now nearly full
moon and among the stars of a certain con-
stellation they would send morse signals
by switching on and off the cabin lights
this was more in the nature of an interesting
experiment for it was questionable whether
this incomparably small gleam of light could
be perceived even by the largest telescopes
on the earth

  then the men set to work and soon the
mirror was taken apart into its silver strips
and rolled up while the lattice work of its
support was stowed away with the crane
the last heavy machine parts were hoisted
on board and the openings were carefully
closed the fuel feeds had already been
changed and adapted for operation with
liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen while
on starting from the earth they had used the
more convenient though somewhat weaker
nitro-benzene which unfortunately could
not be replaced en route

  meanwhile the moon as viewed from the
earth had reached a position  degrees
before full accordingly the tangent to
its orbit cut the orbit of the earth at this
angle also and if travelled on at the right
speed would lead to an ellipse which would
exactly meet the orbit of mars with a trav-
elling time of only  days as compared
with  days if the start had been made
in an ellipse tangential to the earths orbit

  the saving of  days could not be scorn-
ed if one considered that the vital require-
ment in solid and liquid food and in air
to breathe including the requisite chemi-
cals for its production amounted to some
eight kilograms per person per day for
just a one-way trip the saving in load for
four persons would be  tons

chapter iv
coming madness

the start had taken place smoothly and
the attempt to signal by means of the
cabin light had been made whether this
had been successful it was not possible to
determine but now the ship was rushing
through the fearful abyss of space at a
velocity of about  kilometers a second rela-
tive to the earth at  kilometers a sec-
ond relative to the sun

  the moon shrank into a rapidly diminish-
ing crescent while the earth completely
disappeared because the ship was now ex-
actly on its night side this was indeed
disturbing but the doctor remarked that it
was always more important to have the
heavenly body to which they were going in
full sunlight before them than the one
which they were leaving behind

	 

  fifteen weeks of the twenty-four which
the trip was to last had already vanished
into the insatiable maw of the past with-
out the occurrence of anything remarkable
the travellers had long since become accus-
tomed to the condition of the weightless-
ness it was much harder to put up with
the unescapable boredom in the long run
nothing would help the three already they
were getting into an excitable mood

  they quarrelled merely in order to quar-
rel and to prove to themselves that they
were actually still alive and not lying in an
eternal sleep these mutual torments
slowly took on a more threatening form
when the science fiction novelists have
written about space flights and depicted a
mutiny of the crew or something of that
sort they have shown something psycholo-
gically well founded but among the en-
gineer the doctor and inge it went no
farther than rudenesses but rudeness which
they would never have pardoned under ter-
restrial conditions in the case of crews
of baser stock there would actually have
been mutinies and stabbings

  at length they longed intensely for a
change they felt themselves in prison
even more than if they had been in the
a daring trip tomars



notorious venetian lead chambers and fin-
ally all their desire was directed at burst-
ing the narrow walls of the ship in an
attack of such space madness the engineer
had once come near beating with his fists
on the switchboard of the levers and smash-
ing the glass coverings of the delicate indi-
cating apparatus

  it was only with difficulty that the doc-
tor and inge together were able to calm
him since his strength was not held in
check by the limitations of terrestrial grav-
ity

  on another occasion-contrary to the
previously agreed on duty schedule-when
both men were sleeping at the same time
with only inge on guard at the controls
she was seized by an irresistible desire to
move the gas lever to ignite the rockets
and to commence a mad flight through
space without regard to the calculated
course she had already set the starter
to work when her husband awakened by
the humming of the pumps sprang up and
pulled her back just as she was going to
throw the great gas lever forward

	 

  the twentieth week was drawing to a
close

  if only something would happen
screamed the engineer striking the table
with his fist i cannot stand this any
longer

  the devil has bewitched our ship just
as he did to the three-master of the flying
dutchman replied the doctor

  arent you two ashamed to talk that
way perhaps good spirits are accom-
panying our rocket and keeping away the
meteors which otherwise would have long
since smashed it

  well do you believe my dear lady
first in spirits and then in the kind that
catch meteors in cosmic butterfly nets in
order to keep us safe from these mosquitos
of space i dont

  the engineer stepped indifferently to the
forward window his attitude was not that
of the responsible captain for they had all
long since forgotten all ships discipline and
no longer stuck to hours on duty with free
intervals between

out there mars wras shining still look-
ing like a star though just as bright
or even brighter than venus appears to the
eye of the dweller on earth when it shines
with its greatest brilliance as the evening
star it wras still about seven million kilo-
meters away but the ship was catching up
from behind at an excess speed of some four
kilometers a second

  on more exact observation it could be
recognized even with the naked eye as a tiny
half illuminated disk and with only an
enlargement of  times in the telescope
the image was clearer than with a 
time enlargement by observatories on the
earth at the most favorable opposition of
mars

  just for pleasure the engineer was about
to adjust the keen glass to mars when he
noticed a tiny luminous point moving slight-
ly in the field of vision of the telescope a
thing which was striking because it was just
passing between two fixed stars located
very close together

  at last something interesting children
he called over to the other two come and
look at the little star i do not know wheth-
er i am seeing badly or whether the lenses
are getting coated

  inge looked through the glass then the
doctor both admitted that the body look-
ed misty to them also

  then it is a cometdecided the engin-
eer for to differentiate between comets
and the little planets or asteroids today the
orbit does not serve as an indication but the
tail or misty covering does

  the doctor plunged into some books and
suddenly developed a quite unsuspected zeal
in working the slide rule then he report-
ed this is not one of the known comets
which are now en route and crossing our
path for none of them seen from our pres-
ent position can be in this direction
meanwhile inge and her husband were
attentively watching the course of the new
heavenly body which was gradually in-
creasing in size and luminosity and after a
few hours attained the size of the full moon
though actually only as a washed out path
of mist with a bright nucleus at length
after fehe second hour following the dis-


wonder stories

covery a sort of explosion seemed to occur
on the comet suddenly a sheaf of lumin-
ous matter rose from the nucleus at once
curving into a fountain-like jet which es-
caped into space in the direction away from
the sun now the brilliance of the pheno-
menon increased unceasingly and soon the
comet surpassed mars in total luminosity

  unfortunately the determination of the
distance by the method of orbit calculation
is not yet possible explained the doctor
we must wait a while but i estimate that
this thing is still a good  million kilo-
meters behind the orbit of mars which it
will cross at the parabolic speed of about
 kilometers a second sb it is approach-
ing us daily by about  million kilometers
and will presumably cross the pathof our
space ship in four days if it does not ac-
tually collide with us

  at this conclusion inge shuddered what
they had all desired the great cosmic event
had arrived but now it was already filling
them more with anxiety than with joy
the comet had however one good effect the
quarrels ceased and the performance of
duty was again rigidly adhered to

  on the third day when inge was sitting
alone at the lookout post and had adjusted
the telescope in order to get a better look
she was horrified when she turned the tel-
escope to the comet now it stood among
seven fixed stars with its head up from
which gases streamed and curved around
with the effect of parted hair while the
streams joined together farther below and
the comets tail hung down like a flowing
beard the nucleus had divided into two
luminous centers which glowed like fiery
eyes the whole thing looked like a
threatening spirit blocking the way with
angry glances

  then inge thought of the words of st
john in the mystic revelation which is
wiitten in the first chapter verses  to 
and in the midst of the seven candlesticks
one like unto the son of man  his
head and his hairs were white like wool
    and his eyes were as a flame of fire
    and he had in his right hand seven
stars  and out of his mouth went a sharp

two-edged sword  and his countenance was
as the sun shineth in his strength

into the mists

and as a matter of fact the two-edged
sword was not lacking a spear-like
jet of gas short and dazzlingly bright was
just shooting out toward the sun a thing
the terrestrial astronomers call the forma-
tion of an abnormal comets tail as if
tbat was not enough the picture became
still more frightful

  the normal emissions of gas from both
nuclei were now being so evolved that they
formed something like two horns above the
head of the comet while the two eyes
moved farther part and took a lower posi-
tion in the image of the head leaving be-
tween them a relatively dark space open
which opened before the ship like the black
jaws of a monster with wide apart deeply
basilisk eyes

  with a shriek inge tottered back and
would have fallen from the steersmans seat
if this had been at all possible in the con-
dition of weightlessness then the two
men sprang up and rushed to the levers and
apparatus

  it was high time the comet whose dis-
tance from the ship could in no way be
exactly determined since the faint contours
of the wanderer afforded no measurements
was nevertheless much nearer to the ship
than the doctor had estimated and now it
was rushing straight at them it now look-
ed like a mad bull with the countenance of
a dragon now everything was at stake

  all clear to maneuver ordered the en-
gineer have the spare suits at hand i
think it will be better for us to put the
suits right on for on colliding with the com-
et-if it comes to that-a splinter of the
monster can easily pierce the ship and al-
low the air in the cabin to escape if we
have our suits on absence of air cannot
harm us only if one is actually struck is
he lost

  in order to reduce the probability of all
being struck together the engineer ar-
ranged that inge should remain amidships
in the cabin the doctor should climb down
a daring trip to mars



into the engine room while he himself took
the pilots position in -the conning tower
then all the bulkheads in the ship were
closed the great distance measurer was
again pushed out and took in the comet with
its stereoscopic jaws

  from minute to minute the engineer read
off the positions and called them through
the wire to the doctor who was down in the
engine room trying as best he could to
calculate the relative path of the comet to
the ship soon it was evident that diverg-
ing to one side would have required such
great acceleration that the machinery could
not have produced it this would also
have demanded so much fuel that even in
case of success the return to the earth would
have been questionable

  there was nothing to be done but to ac-
cept the struggle and to try to pass between
the two nuclei of the comet right through
the black jaws when it was to be hoped
that the slight mass of the cometary nuclei
would not cause too much disturbance of
their path and attract the ship into a disas-
trous course the only things to be feared
were direct hits by splinters the friction of
the comet gases on the walls of the ship and
sand blast effects on the skin of the ship
but there was no choice

  with his eyes fixed on the distant meas-
urer his hands on the levers the engineer
was like the record driver who knows that
the dangerous s-curve is now coming which
determines life or death a pressure of his
foot set the starter in operation and when
the combustion chambers were warm the
hand on the lever gave a little gas it was
not necessary to turn the ship around for
here the adversary was to be attacked from
in front

  the minutes seemed hours the head of
the comet probably ten times as great in
diameter as our earth became more and
more invisible more and more transparent
the nearer it sped for its gassy veil was
being spread over an ever greater space in
the sky

  we will not notice at all when we are
in it edmund cried inge through the tel-
ephone when she noticed this if only the
comets nuclei were behind us

  at this moment the needles of the exter-
nal thermometers began to quiver and rise
soon they mounted to  then to  deg-
rees centigrade

  we are in the mists said the doctor
from the machine room for he too could
look ahead through a periscopic telescope

  the pointers rose to  degrees anx-
iously the engineer called into the telephone
if that keeps on the outer wall will soon
be red hot but we will stand it a while
the beryllium has a high melting point and
it will take at least ten minutes for the heat
to be conducted through the insulating lay-
er then there will really be danger that
the tanks may explode

  there there look screamed inge the
nuclei are rushing at us the left one is
nearer

u i- ook out i must give full gas

  j-i shouted back the engineer to be
heard above the humming then we will
make a sharp turn to the right we must
get through the middle as closely as possi-
ble and then we will have the fields of
gravity of the nuclei balancing each other
already the steering gyroscope was buzzing
and was swinging the nose of the ship to
the right five seconds later all the cham-
bers were expelling their fearful sheaves
of flame into space but the people in the
ship were panting and writhing in their
heavy space suits

  still the temperature at the outer wall
kept rising and had passed  degrees
when the ship flew between the two nuclei
at the speed of nearly  kilometers a sec-
ond for it had  itself and the comet was
shooting in the other direction at about 
the nuclei some  kilometers apart
looked like swarms of arc lights circling in
a fog like flies

  then there was a blow against the wall
the engineer at once called through the wire
to inge and his friend inge immediately
replied but the doctors voice sounded hol-
low and weak

a break one tank is running out
two chambers are spitting i i am   

i	am  then the connection broke


bonder stories

off inge inquired shall i try to help
him

  impossible now wait five minutes
more

  when two combustion chambers on one
side gave out the rocket threatened to turn
over as sometimes occurs in the case of
artillery shells this the engineer could
only avert by shutting off two chambers on
the other side before this was properly
managed three minutes had passed the
outside tenyperatures were still rising and
there was the danger that the tanks would
soon explode there was only one way out
to be tried attempting to get out of the fog
in the shortest way by cutting across the
direction of the tail of the comet

  quickly the engineer seized the wheel
his decision was reached all would be
settled in the next few seconds fuel-
the more used up now the better for then
the tanks would not explode so readily
through heating

   once more the man at the controls pushed
the lever to its full extent and turned the
steering wheel for the sharpest lateral turn
almost unwillingly the ship obeyed the
task performed with superhuman muscular
effort against the fearful pressure was suc-
cessful the patches of mist became thin-
ner and soon the stars shone clearly from
the depths of the heavens the ship was
saved the utmost peril averted

  in the upper room everything was in
order the suits could be taken off which
inge at once did for she was already at the
end of her strength but the engineer
still in his helmet crawled into the air-
lock of the descending shaft and closed the
upper cover before opening the lower one

   and that was well for the air in the low-
er room of the ship had escaped to be
sure that alone could not have hurt the
doctor and in fact the engineer found him
in a corner wedged in between two dural-
umin braces which had bent somewhat oth-
erwise he was all right and in good spirits
first the leak had to be made airtight which
was quickly done by means of the previously
prepared plates and rubber inlays then
the engineer filled the lower room of the
ship again with fresh air from the reserve

tanks then he once more climbed up to
the upper room where inge was removed
his helmet got some tools out of the chest
and climbed down again in order to free
the doctor from his confinement which he
managed to do after some effort a few
minutes later the doctor was sitting freed
from his space suit in the comfortable cab-
in in the usual light clothing which they
wore in the ship

  that was a narrow escape remarked
the engineer

  but it was after all a marvelous exper-
ience which i should not have wanted to
miss now that i am safely past it

  what are all the sensations on earth
which the millionaires chase after com-
pared with this struggle with a comet
commented inge and clung close to her hus-
band whom she looked at proudly

  i did not worry about myself added
the doctor when i saw that i was merely
wedged in i even felt comfortable down
there it was simply unpleasant that com-
munication with you was interrupted and
that i did not know whether you were still
alive and would come to liberate me

        chapter v
        the return

but the adventure with the comet un-
fortunately had an unpleasant conse-
quence part of the fuel had been ex-
hausted equivalent in propulsion power to
at least  meters a second then two
combustion chambers were damaged and
could not be repaired without the utmost
difficulty while two others on the opposite
side could not be run to maintain symme-
trical propulsion but all this did not mat-
ter too much-merely the maximum accel-
eration was reduced from  meters a sec-
ond to about 

  one could still attain any final velocity
only it would take somewhat longer and
therefore consume more fuel this was the
disastrous feature of the otherwise success-
ful escape from the collision with the com-
et in passing between the nuclei of the
comet and turning out of the tail  met-
a daring trip to mars



ers a second of propulsion power had beeri
consumed the remainder would just have
sufficed to bring the -velocity of the space
ship which theoretically was to amount to
 kilometers a second on cutting the orbit
of mars to the  kilometers a second
possessed by mars itself

  now there was also the disturbance of
their course because of their detour which
would have to be corrected again thus
hard as it was they had to give up the idea

oi	visiting mars this time and landing on it
and simply to pass by it at a distance of

	kilometers

  at the same time we have fortune in our
misfortune and not a little of jt explained
the engineer when he looked up again from
his calculations for the first time in two
hours the comet has cast us exactly into
a course that when crossing the earths orbit
we shall meet the earth itself and in fact
we shall reach it from behind at an angle
of only about two degrees a favorable state
of affairs because then we shall approach
with a difference in velocity of only about
four kilometers a second

  to be sure its gravitation will impart
to us a free fall velocity of  meters a
second by the time we enter the atmos-
phere but if we succeed at the last mo-
ment in gliding tangentially to the earth
so that the top of the hyperbola in which
we arrive is some  to  kilometers
above sea level in thin strata of air which
will allow braking then we can undertake
the actual landing as though we had sim-
ply returned from a flight to the moon with
a perfectly intact ship

  the doctor rose and shook his friends
hand fellow if you do that whole thing
just as well as you did the landing on the
moon then you deserve to be given the
order of comets of the first class

  inge laughingly agreed

	 

  of course there was no longer a possibil-
ity of a visit to the planet venus which
had originally been planned on the return
trip from mars it had been calculated

oi	iginally however that such a visit would
require neither the time for a considerable
detour nor much expenditure of fuel

  they had passed mars only in a wide are
and at this distance had not been able to
solve its mystery there seemed to be
only one result of the observations namely
that the colors which mars shows in the
telescopes of terrestrial observatories do not
belong to the ground itself as much as they
are the result of absorptions in the martian
atmosphere

  probably the white places are the high-
est cloudlike formations the greenish grey
the ones in the middle and the brick-red
ones the lowest these last are perhaps
really white or grey but since only the
reddish yellow sunlight penetrates so far
down because the martian air does not ad-
mit the other rays only these can be re-
flected again

  this was the doctors opinion but he
in no way insisted on this novel theory
and was frank in admitting its uncertain-
ty

  two hundred and sixty days after the
second cutting of the orbit of mars oiwthe
inward side the space ship was again near-
ing the earth it was high time indeed
for now the supplies of air and food were
gradually running low

  since there was no longer need of the
machinery of the little power plant which
had rendered such good service on the moon
they just threw them overboard as they
formerly had thrown all used up things
and refuse out into space thanks to the
force of ejection they had soon gone out
of sight of the ship

they also resolved to abandon the great
silver mirror though not without first
trying to send morse signals to the earth
with it to tell of their impending arrival
this was done from a distance of 
kilometers the mirror being stretched out
in space beside the ship

  we must free the ship of every possible
kilogram of needless weight insisted the
engineer in the decisive conference in which
they took counsel regarding the landing
maneuvers our supply of fuel is so
scanty that it is just enough for the neces-
sary braking of our tremendous speed for
otherwise we should run into the earth from


wonder stories

behind like a racing auto into a load of
hay

  it really would not hurt the earth see
there a splendid meteor the people would
perhaps shout when our ship in its steep
course shot into the atmosphere and then of
course burned up because of the enor-
mous friction if the pressure had not al-
ready crushed us to death

  toward the end of the next watch when
the engineer was sleeping to get some rest
for the last time before the landing man-
euvers inge who was the lookout noticed
that at the place on the night side of the
earth where berlin was located a dim dot
of light kept flashing and disappearing she
called the doctor who was at the controls
he did not look through the telescope long
before he said those are morse signals
they are flashing something to us note
the long and short signals carefully

  and that is actually what it was berlin
was signalling we have observed and un-
derstood your light signals with the great
plane mirror we have united  search-
lights on the tempelhof field pointed them
toward you and are now giving signals by
simultaneously switching on and off all
these million-candlepower searchlights as
soon as we go out of sight another metro-
polis which is favorably located will be-
gin we are flashing this message every half
hour until you give us a signal that you
have understood then we will communi-
cate directly back and forth

  this was too important to pass over inge
awakened her husband whose time for sleep
was nearly finished with quick decision
he directed the three little searchlights
which the ship still had after the loss of the
great mirror toward the earth and switched
on the current  even though they had to
be sparing of light there was enough for
a few minutes

  and then he sent the reply to the earth
in less than five minutes there came from
paris which in the meanwhile had also en-
tered the night side of the earth the first
signal that they had been understood since
clouds were forming over berlin which
made the sending of other signals impossi-

ble berlin had its greeting to the space
ship transmitted by london

  the engineer flashed back in less than
three hours we shall land in the atlantic
ocean at about the latitude of  to 
degrees notify all ships by radio since it
is possible that at the last moment some-
thing will prevent a good landing especial-
ly as the machinery is damaged and the
fuel very low we still have air to breathe
our diving suits in order parachutes ready
and everybody on board all right with
that he ended his message

  for the last time the bold travellers of
space made ready for landing each had
put on his space suit and his own para-
chute then the engineer stepped on the
starter

  the rockets began to work as before
only four of them were still shut off the
steering gyroscope hummed and turned the
exhaust end of the ship toward the earth
now the engineer gave it the gas again
streams of fire spat from the exhausts the
course was reduced from a hyperbolic to
a parabolic and finally to an elliptic this
was nothing new so long as one was still
outside the atmosphere but when the ship
had already reached the height of  kilo-
meters above sea level and shot toward the
earth in a very much flattened tangential
ellipse the first signs of air resistance made
themselves evident  kilometers up for
the nose of the ship grew perceptibly
warmer

  we must put out the braking disks doc-
tor called the engineer

  as viewed from the outside there now
came from the nose of the ship which was
pointed backward a cable on which there
were arranged at certain distances thin
metal disks which were bent somewhat
backward like cones the result looking like
the familiar tufts on the tail of a childs
toy kite one after another these disks
glowed brightly and were worn away and
burned by air resistance and the resulting
heat along with their cable which burned
like a candle wick

  but new disks kept coming out on more
cable in this way it was possible to con-
vert the tremendous force latent in the mo-
a daring trip to mars



tion of the ship into air whirls and heat
in a gradual fashion and by sacrificing the
metal disks the ship itself was saved from
burning besides this the ship was work-
ing the exhausts in the reverse direction as
long as the fuel held out

  finally the so-called orbital velocity of
 meters a second was passed in their
retarding and thus the danger was eliminat-
ed that they would again be lost in space
the effect was that of a bicycle wheel which
gradually loses its impetus against the pave-
ment of the street when the cyclist has
ceased to pedal thus the horizontal veloc-
ity decreased more and more at last very
quickly too quickly

  if the ship had possessed extensible wings
like those of an airplane a glide landing
would have been possible if there had
been sufficient fuel the engineer could have
let it shoot down toward the sea in a vertical
plunge finally checking it much more eas-
ily and surely than on the airless moon
but neither of the two possibilities existed
here the ship was in any event lost per-
haps the occupants could be saved

  the engineer called a last command
through the wire then inge and the doctor
came to him into the actual control room
each still provided with a special parachute
then by pressing a spring he closed the en-
trance and by another lever made the nose

the

 of the ship open up at the same moment
 the strong counter-current of air pulled out
 the great parachute and with it the control
 chamber which now proved to be a life-
 buoy the ship itself dived down

   the great parachute indeed moderated
 the descent from several thousand to a few
 hundred meters a second but in the long
 run it was unequal to the evolution of heat
 and caught fire now there was only one
 recourse for rescue to burst the chamber
 and jump out to seek safety each on his
 own little parachute this too was all
 ready and a second later the three people
 were floating down to the earth on white
 parachutes which stood out against the sky
 like shrapnel clouds this time the ropes
 held and the parachutes proved adequate
 until the sea received the bold travellers of
 space and rocked them on its waves until
 a swift seaplane arrived to take them aboard

   the slender sinewy man who was the
 first to leap into the water who swam to
 inge and aided her to unscrew the diving
 helmet was none other than tom sacket
 chief correspondent of the globe five sec-
 onds later there in his bathing suit he had
 already got out his pad of paper and begun
 the interview and in ten more minutes the
 radio of the hydroplane now soaring up
 with roaring motors was sending the first
 news to his paper

thunderbolt
if the national congress as a sign that the
world was going-o the dogs a delegation
of business men visited carol and threaten-
ed to withdraw all advertising support from
his paper he received hundreds of letters
of praise and threats-some letters barely
legible others indicating that the sender was
a person of wealth and culture a plot to
bomb his building was discovered on the
day that booth again began the aggressive
broadcast of the cloud pictures

  through two days of stormy debate in the
national congress the bill was the subject
of all attention and even the cloud pictures

and on the
day that the bill passed and the president
signed it twenty-five congressmen picked
up their hats and walked from the halls
they said never to return leaving their
frmer colleagues with an uneasy forebod-
ing silence

  that night there was rioting in a dozen
american cities in south america and in
european nations where bills similar to the
american act were before the national con-
gresses the morning papers reported in
america alone three hundred men and wo-
men arrested and imprisoned under the new
defense of property act mobs storm-

ed the streets to be dispersed by the massed
onslaughts of the police who were acting
under orders to break up all crowds

  it became evident however that there was
a reluctance of authorities to make general
arrests the leaders of the radicals only be-
ing the first victims

  as he read the reports flashing over the
elher and the wires from various parts of
the world and he flashed his televisor from
city to city carol became sick at heart he
saw only bloodshed rioting distress every-
where all the primeval forces in man
seemed to be breaking out at some signal
against the carefully built up restraints of
civilization even the leaders business and
political seemed to be losing their heads
and giving wild statements to frantic and
greedy newspapers

  in desperation carol left his office and
returned to his home in the closet of his
fathers room he signalled for booth and
soon had a connection with the man

  booth noticed carols drawn face are
you working too hard carol

  its not that carol blurted out but
we must do something the world is go-
ing to smash

  booth nodded sadly i saw it all but
what can we do

  must you go on carol asked desper-
ately

  have you forgotten booth asked gent-
ly have you forgotten the picture i gave
you of what faces man twenty years hence
do you want to expose your world to that
terrible war and its aftermath

  carol groaned yes youre right but
we must do something

  booth nodded well try but get
away from your office for a few days you
are worn out i want you to come here
there are some things i must show you
carol looked intently at the screened
image of the man before him he could
look at booth dispassionately now was the
man really sincere in this game did he
have the welfare of the world really at
heart no he could not question booth
the drawn lines of booths face showed
that the man was suffering too

  ill come tomorrow carol said good-
bye the image faded from the screen

  for the rest of the day carol remained
at home trying at frequent intervals to
get joan on the telephone but despite the
invariable replies that she was not at
heme carol persisted at ten oclock that
evening he gave it up and retired to an un-
easy sleep

  it was early the next morning accom-
panied by pimpkins that carol rose into
the air from the field in back of his home
to begin the journey to booths cave the
same journey that he had taken as an inno-
cent youth a month before

carol looked forward with an eager-
ness mixed with dread to this meeting
with booth he began to doubt seriously his
ability to carry on this gigantic program
with his own world alienated against him
jean estranged and this terrible secret of
the time projector weighing on him

  he saw himself trapped between two de-
sires equally strong they could not be
reconciled yet he could not choose between
them

  the scenery is beautiful along here
pimpkins ventured as they swung above the
new jersey flatlands

  carol did not answer

  the housekeeper tells me thrt the help
is beginning to be alarmed at the house
sir he went on

  alarmed carol asked

  yes sir theres been so many strange
people seen around you know she asked
you to have guards about the place sir

  carol did remember he had laughed off
the old womans fears but perhaps she
was not wrong besides he had no right to
expose his help to possible injury

  ill have it done when we return peter
carol said and relapsed into silence

  it was not until they had almost reach-
ed the bald mountain top that carol began
to feel the load of anxiety wearing from
him now that he was approaching booths
physical presence a new wave of optimism
filled him

  with the televisor broadcaster on he cir
cled over the mountain and watched as the
the time projector



bald top parted into halves and rolled
back to expose again the little encampment
setting the helicopters carol slid the ma-
chine gradually earthward below him he
could see as not more than dots two fig-
ures moving from a building

  swiftly the machine descended and final-
ly came to a landing within the stone walls
booth reached the machine as carol leaped
out they shook hands warmly

  welcome carol booth said im glad
to have you here again carol noticed a
slight twinkle in his serious eyes

  carol turned to peter and pointed to the
two large rear compartments of the fusel-
age will you take my things peter

  as peter moved toward the rear of the
plane booth stopped him

  wait he said he walked toward the
tail of the plane opened the end compart-
ment and looked in

  you may come out now he said grave-
ly addressing the opened space

  as the others watched in amazement
there was a slight movement in a pile of
waterproof sail that covered the top of the
compartment and an arm reached out and
moved about helplessly as though to grasp
some unseen support it was a white arm
round and soft looking booth climbed to
the compartment level and pulled back the
sailing a head lifted from within and the
face of joan blake dirty and dispirited
faced the three men

  carol sprang to her side joan
dont touch me she screamed then
she looked about in amazement at the stone
walls the white low buildings and at the
sky being shut out by the slowly closing
cavern roof

  where am i she asked dazed as she
looked from one to the other of the men

  only at the retreat of an old man
booth said gently may i help you down
she looked at him for a moment and
carol saw a silent fire of conversation
between them questioning cross question-
ing each other joans face softened and
she gave booth her hand soon she was
standing on the cavern floor with carol be-
side her

to be

     joan this is a pleasure he said laugh-
  ing im honored

    joan shrank away she semed ready to
  burst into tears this is no pleasure trip

  i	am spying on you

    spying carols face hardened

    booth interrupted miss blake is prob-
  ably not serious carol come we mustnt
  talk about it then to joan will you
  allow me to escort you to some quarters
  joan nodded coldly and with booth at
  her side and a dazed carol following ac-
  companied by peter and george they moved
  off to the buildings

    when carol had been installed in his
  room he lost no time in searching out
  booth in the latters quarters

    you knew that joan was hiding in the
  plane he asked somewhat belligerently
  he felt that booth may have introduced
  joan into the secret without his knowledge

    yes booth answered i felt it neces-
  sary now that you were becoming the ob-
  ject of so much controversy to watch over
  you by the televisor i saw miss blake
  steal into your plane early this morning
  then you had nothing to do with it
  carol asked incredulously

    nothing booth answered but per-
  haps the young lady will explain her
  father is william blake

    carol nodded he had already explained
  to booth over their private communication
  the threat of discovery from blake booth
  had merely stated that he was ready for
  blake

    you understand booth said gently
  that miss blake must remain here

    carol started yes he admitted i
  suppose you are right but couldnt she
  promise 

    would you subject her to that booth
  asked it would be quite a strain for her
  to face her father daily knowing what she
  did about us  

    do as you see fit carol sighed but
  treat her well   

    need you ask me booth answered at
once and with that carol left him to seek
out the explanation from joan that was tor-
turing him with doubt

facts as space is limited we cannot undertake to answer more uiun three questions for eacn letter
the flood of correspondence received makes it impractical also to print answers as soon as we receivo
questions however questions of general interest will receive careful attention

positions of the planets

editor question and answers	

  where are the planets seen i mean in what part
of the sky and in what months are they visible 
would appreciate it if you would make some sort of a
table stating these facts

                          stephen roberts

                            laurel street

                         manchester n h

  the planets as their name indicates from the
greek planetes wanderer move about continually
against the background of fixed stars but they are
always in a belt called the zodiac which is euht
degrees each way north and south from the ecliptic
or apparent path of the sun among the stars the
sun and moon were in ancient days because of their
motions in the sky reckoned as two of the seven
planets the others being mercury venus mars
jupiter and saturn in modern astronomy the sun
and moon arc no longer considered planets but the
number has been increased by adding not only the
earth but uranus neptune pluto and the asteroids
whih exceed a thousand in number

  in order to locate the planets it is desirable to have
a star map showing the constellations of the zodiac
which serve as frames of reference jupiter and ven-
us may often however be recognized by their bril-
liancy which at its greatest far exceeds that of any
fixed star mars and saturn are less distinctive
mercury though brilliant is seldom seen in northern
latitudes because of his nearness to the sun a keen
eye might detect uranus or the asteroid ceres if the
exact position were indicated but the others arc al-
ways invisible without the aid of telescopes

at the beginning of may  the plafiets are

placed as follows mercury is almost directly bctwben
the sun and the earth and therefore invisible he
will reappear as a morning star reaching great bril-
liancy three weeks after the conjunction but as said
above will be very hard to find the astronomer
copernicus is said to have died lamenting that during
his long ufe he had never seen mercury he had not
however a telescope

  venus is in the midst of the constellation pisces
and will rise in the morning about two hoars before
the sun on may  it is impossible to mistake venus
which is the brightest object in the night sky and
which con even be seen in daylight if the observer
looks in the right place

  jupiter on the other hand is brighter than any
stars mars will be easier to identify he will set about
ning he is in the constellation gemini which may
be identified by its two bright stars the twins which
are fairly close together northeast of orion jupiter
moves at the rate of only one sign of the zodiac a
year

  mars also an evening star is much less brilliant
he is at present in the constellation cancer moving
east as this constellation has no first-magnitude
stars mars will be easier to identify he will set about
midnight much later than jupiter

  saturn is at present a morning star in the southern
constellation sagittarius rising not long after mid-
night he is of about the same brightness as mars
but less red since saturn takes thirty years to cir-
cle the sun his change of place is comparatively small
from year to year

  uranus which passed behind the sun on april 
is in pisces not far from venus neptune is dn the
constellation leo in the eastern sky in the oarly
evening but these two will not be observable


wonder stories



  the outer or superior planets saturn and jupiter
are comparatively regular in their progress though
they apparently swing back and forth each year this
effect due to the more rapid motion of the earth in
its orbit is what might be called an exaggerated par-
allax effect the movement of mars is much more
irregular because he is extremely close to the earth in
comparison

  the inner or inferior planets circle the ran more
rapidly than the earth mercury making more than
four revolutions during one of our years they move
so fast that a lengthy table is necessary to indicate
their exact positions from time to time however in-
formation will be found usually in any almanac
which will serve as a guide to identify the outer
planets it is necessary to know the brighter btars of
the zodiac with which they might otherwise be con-
fused-editor

a correction

 in one of your issues of wonder storied in
the science questions and answers department
one of your readers asked the difference in construc-
tion of the infra-red and ultra-violet type of lamps
the mercury tungsten arc lamp was described in full
detail without giving credit or mentioning the name
of- the manufacturer of this type of ultra-violet
source

  this type of si sunlamp incidently was discover-
ed and perfected at the labs of the general electric
vapor lamp co find is being manufactured by the
general electric co and the westinghouso elcctrio
co

  these units as bought by the publio consist of an
envelope of corex-d glass which permits the radiation
of wavelengths as low as  angstrom units which
is well in the erythema producing region yet above the
conjunctivitis region thus eliminating the necessity
of goggles in using the lamp

  this little correction in one ofl your future maga-
zines will be duly appreciated

ships speed mast be continually increased by 
feet per second it is questionable whether this ac-
celeration could be borne by men for  minutes
not to say sixty days if the acceleration is only 
feet per second per second it would take  days
to reach the required speed

 the second problem is that of power a space
ship traveling away from the earth would normally
use its power only eight minutes and then it would
be exhausted and under the most favorable condi-
tions the resulting speed would be  miles per sec-
ond but the ship our correspondent has in mind
must use its power continually for either  or 
days as the case may be for power is needed even
in space away from all gravitation to accelerate the
ships speed the amount of power required there-
fore would be simply stupendous

  the third question is that raised by the einstein
theory according to einstein the inertial mass of
a body increases with its speed and the inertial
mass is exactly that which requires power to bpeed
up the body now as the speed arrives let us say at

	miles per second the inertial mass becomes lar-
ger perceptibly and the power required to accelerate
the ship becomes greater and greater each second
finally as the speed approaches that of light the in-
ertial mass approaches infinity and the power re-
quired to speed it up approaches infinity

  in a daring trip to mars by the late max val-
ier in this issue the author discusses how this feat
might be attained by the use of atomic energy-edi-

speedy rocket ships

editor science questions and answers

  once outside of the atmosphere would it be possible
for a rocket ship to attain a speed of  miles
per second the speed of light

                      n w monroe st
                     chicago 

  theoretically and taken most generally there is
sio reason why a speed of that of light could not be
attained practically however the problem presents
different aspects

  in the first place the acceleration of a ship start-
ing from rest is limited by what the occupants can
stand let us assume that this limiting acceleration
is five times that of gravity or  feet per second
each second to reach a speed of  miles per
second at that rate of acceleration would take ap-
proximately sixty days now this does not mean
simply that the ship must be moving for sixty days
it means that every second of that sixty days the

  referring to page  of the june issue we men-
tioned that james mackaye in his book the dyna-
mic universe scribners built up a case for what
he called his dynamic theory of gravitation his
theme was that all space is filled with radiations
called the ether perhaps which penetrate all bodies
when the radiations however pass through material
bodies such as planets stars etc some of the radia-
tions change their nature and lose part of their pres-
sure-producing power when they emerge from a
material body then they are pressnreless in between
two bodies therefore there is an area composed part-
ly of pressureless radiations a sort of partial pres-
sure vacuum thus by the superior force of the pres-
sure see the illustration herewith on the far side
of the bodies they are drawn toward each other
while this theory can stand serious questioning it is
supported by numberless proofs offered by the auth-
or it is helpful even though it may be eventually
disproved as opening a new line of questioning of
one of the most important and least understood
phenomena of the cosmos-editor

       utopia and the world fair

editor wonder stories

  although i have been a constantly pleased and fully
satisfied reader of wonder stories ever since it
was first published i havent yet taken the opportunity
to express my opinion of our magazine until now
the whole simple cause of my finally writing this let-
ter is that super-excellent most delightful and entirely
different masterpiece utopia island

  this truly utopian tale will naturally receive many
words of praise and thanks from other readers but it
can never be over-praised for the author otfrid von
iianstein has so splendidly carefully and realistically
written the tale that the reader actually feels himself
an elated member and participant in the entire story
truly an extraordinary and utopian masterpiece i
and then theres the announcement of another marve-
lous tale a daridg trip to mars by max valier
this will be another masterpiece im sure

  while reading of the sport festival in utopia
island i had a rather strange idea wouldnt it be
wonderful if some of the astounding inventions used
in the festival on santa seientia could be developed
for the coming worlds fair in chicago wouldnt
the rest of the world be astounded by the ultra-futuris-
tic exhibition that chicago would develop if it possessed
the marvelous and ingenious utopian inventions
rather a startling dream isnt it a dream a soap-
bubble which is supported only by that tiny insigni-
ficant word if nevertheless even though it is
entirely impossible for chicago to possess a santa scien-
tia in time for  it is certan that some time in the
future there will exist a true utopia and then the world
will actually begin to live to develop that ultimate
in all arts and sciences i

  for that reason i wish that i possessed a time-maeli- 
ine so that i might catch a few glimpses of the utopia
of the future but wishes are futile my mind tells
me go think work and construct a time-machine
and then  i

  back to farth all in all the june issue of won-
der stories was perfect every story in this issue
avas excellent with the utopian story at the peak
and that marvelous tale in the spacesphere a very
close second more issues like this one and we shall

        a contracting universe

editor wonder stories 

  t am not egotistical enough to imagine myself a
scientist but i would like to offer my solution to
mr p schuyler millers perplexing problem

  einstein and others have propounded new ideas
which might have revolutionized classical physics one
is almost forced to believe that these new concepts have
destroyed the physical universe so far as an ability to
picture it physically is concerned

  probably a fairly accurate conception of the world

old-fashioned brick bat all are equally welcome
all of your letters ab much as space will allow will
be published here for the benefit of all due to the
large influx of mail no communications to this de-
partment are answered individually unless c in
stamps to cover time and postage is jemitted

would be more readily achieved if we admitted at the
outset that we have a psychological rather than a
physical world to picture

  it was long ago recognized that an infinite universe
cannot be reconciled with newtons law of gravitation
if this were true then there would be infinite mass in
all directions with the result that an indeterminate force
would attract every celestial body from all directions

  a stable system like a solar system oould not exist
y we imagine an infinite space with an infinite num-
ber of stars we could well wonder why these celestial
bodies did not scatter throughout eternity

  einstein assumed the universe to have a finite vol-
ume although it was unbounded however the circum-
ference of a circle has no end but it has a definite
length this is so because it is curved tin earths
surface is endless but definite in area since no
human can conceive of sphericaj space it can only be
represented mathematically

  einstein propounded the idea of a curvature to the
universe-thus a boundless universe which is limited

  for anyone who may be interested my source of in-
formation is foundations of the universe by m
luckiesh published by d van nostrand company
new york

                      richard a d evans

                       converse ave

                           springfield 

  while we agree in the main with mr evans views
he omits one point the universe might well be drawn
together by an infinite force or it might conversely
be scattered in all directions but the accomplishment
of this might take millions of years we must remem-
ber that man has been observing the heavens with
exactness for only a few hundred years and his exact
data on the far off stars dates perhaps for only 
years we therefore have only an infinitesimal base
on which to determine what might have been going on
for millions upon millions of years and what we have
been able to determine is practically of no cosmic conse-
quence

  the fastest moving nebula travels so we learn at
approximately  miles a second or in a year  
of a light year now this and other stars may be up-
ward of  light years away it would then
take  years for that nebula to reach us
assuming that the solar system is the centftr upon which
the whole universe may be contracting how there-
fore can we determine with our hundred years or so
of observation that this is or is not occurring or
that the universe is not exploding-as present day
astronomers believe-that all heavenly bodies are not
rushing away from a center we must be patient for
another  years in order to gather real data
upon which to judge these cosmic events-editor

science fiction movies

editor wonder stories

  i suppose i am not the only reader of science fiction
who has often wondered why so few motion pictures
are based on this popular type of literature while
the films have gone in heavily for western love and
crime stories they have ignored almost entirely the rich
and fertile field of science fiction of course there
have been a few notable exceptions such as the lost
world metropolis and by rocket to the moon
but these worthwhile efforts were buried in the deluge
of hooey from hollywood

  the indifference of movie producers to science fiction
is probably due to a mistaken idea on their part that
the public does not care for science fiction

state that two bodies cannot occupy the same space

body cannot occupy more than one space at the same

       things like this that cause me to think that if
the time-travelling exponents are rights then am
hats clever and original writers should be privi-
leged to use time-travelling machines in their stories
however because of the interesting adventures which
their heroes may have in some future time

the sargasso monster turned out to be about
what i expected of edsel newton-very poor indeed

  hamilton is at his best in the man who evolved 
a very thought-provoking story

  it has been said lhait there are only about five or
six real original plots for stories and that all stories
are only rehashed versions of these half-dozen types
if ever a machine is invented to automatically rehash
theso plots into new stories and there probably will
be then i would expect the machine-made story to
rad something like the usual hamilton product-with
itssjeadly monotony of style	

  while i sympathize with leslie f stone in her
fight to uphold the importance of women yet i feel
that she has overdone the thing in the conquest of
gola here men are the ascendant sex while men
may love respect hate or detest women they do not
usually regard women as ineffectual creatures to sym-
pathize for or despise as the case may be as a bunch
of weaklings yet this is the abnormaj viewpoint
which the golan women took toward their men be-
cause they happened to be the weaker sex

  i wih you would cease to waste valuable space
with bug stories i detest them granted that
big bugs or insects ar possible there is no science
in them i refer of course to great green things
but it has been your policy lately to print a similar
story in each issue

  lastly i add my voice to those of many others
and request that you have more illustrations by paul-
two to every story if you wish we simply cant get
too many

  mr pancoast evidently overlooked the vital part
of the schacliner and zagat theme their idea was
that in the new universe all phenomena were differ-
ent in their nature in our own universe space is
black because the absence of light conveys an im-
pression to our optic nerves that we have interpreted
as blackness there is no reason why in the topsy-
turvy universe pictured space might not have intrin-
sic properties of its own that convey impressions of
other colors

  naturally the theme our authors took was a very
difficult one to carry out to its bitterly logical end
but from reader comments they did a marvelous job

villain is a victim

editor wonder stories

  when you used to publish your science fiction in
science and invention i always would read the fic-
tion before turning to the more serious part of -the
maeazine later i became a charter subscriber to
amazing stories and then science wonder
stories hitherto i have remained silent because
i have felt that your policy was balanced as could be
expected but the frequency in which you publish time
stories induces me to let off a lot of steam

  some of these stories in which the heroes travel into
the past without actually being able to affect the
past in any way are quite convincing but when as in
worlds to barter in the may issue they present
one time affecting another they do so in a sloppy
manner for if we could influence the past or the
future would it continue to remain past or future
in worlds to barter all the people of the twenty-
first century would have had to have done was to pay
no attention to the men of the future as they could
not harm them because to do so would prevent their
birth	

  it has been pointed out in the reader speaks that
if a man could influence the past he oould by killing
his ancestor prevent his birth similarly if we could
perceive events of the future we could prevent calami-
ties by eliminating the causes in the present

  tims if we knew by traveling into the future that
a certain person would cause a tremendous world cala-
mity we could prevent one of that persons ancestors
from reproducing thus preventing the calamity then
what wo perceived as future would not be the future

ion impossible bat i do feel that insulating people

  there are many things in your magazine that i dis-
like but i think the readers letters are about the worst
mine included one author will go into a streak of
genius and wear out his imagination developing the
story have real situations work in the science logi-
cally yet naturally put in natural drama and comedv
relief and bring the whole to a fitting climax and
in a couple of months you will find in the reader
speaks letters claiming he is too bizarre etc or else
no mention at all

  another will take his people to some planet in some
fashion he fails to explain and have them meet people
or beasts which he fails to account for and suddenly
bring out a marvelously beautiful girl with whom the
hero falls in love a love whifch she of course recipro-
cates and then take them through a series of impos-
sible adventures why are heroines all beautiful
most beautiful girls are so insipid when you know
them i have known many cases of love at first sight
all of which developed into indifference at continued
absence that sort of story is disgusting yet your
letters all say what fine stories they are

  if the world follows the trend proposed by most
of your authors i pity it they all show a decided
lack of balance most them go into great detail on
the mechanical side of it but forget about the social
side those that go into finance all imagine a sys-
tem similar to our own when we consider that
money as we know it today was non-existent five
centuries ago i personally doubt if the world will
endure a fluctuating standard the rest of this cen-
tury rut the social side is almost abandoned lov-
ina johnsons letter seemed to express a sentiment
which we hear too often today

  the supposed disintegration of the home is i feel
due to circumstances of environment rather than
lack of ideals change the environment and your
problem will vanish i feel that this is true of crime
also certainly we all violate laws or morals because
we feel it is to our advantage to do so if we all
felt that we would lose by so doing i doubt if there
would be any social problems except mentally diseased
and that is only a problem of courage

  both the freudian and behaviorist schools claim
that environment is a most important factor her-
editary traits are like clay and environment the sculp-
tor we can raise almost perfect humans if we
bent our effort along this line with the same energy
we give to physics and its associated exact sciences

  then also what about the aesthetic nature of the
future f how will all this promised uniformity effect
us will we cease to have theaters concerts motion
pictures i hope so on that hist will television
supplant them what about art dr keller has
taken up the physical side but recreation is merely
touched on

  its true as mr childs points out that wo all
seek in a story for what we personally are hungry
for one man wants to be a hero and to read an
heroic story and conquer great difficulties another
wants just pure adventure and to travel in a story
to distant worlds another wants to find some ideas
and thoughts to stimulate his mind to each of these
aspirations science fiction offers food

  with regard to contests we refer our readers to
the interplanetary plot contest in the spring 
wonder stories quarterly which is now on the news-
stands we believe it will offer more real interest
and enjoyment as well as constructive opportunities
to our readers than anything else we have offered-

  i reading your stories i become almost hypnotized
with interest hating to go to bed while reading these
most unusual and gripping stories

  i will not take up mucn more of your time than
to tell you that all my short life  years i have
had a wild desire to go to mars or the moon or any
other foreign planets reading your most exciting
and magazine has created a desire that is of long
standing and if you ever know of any stray trips
of this nature that might need about  lbs of bal-
last for no good reason why please let me know and
i will pack up and join you no matter where the
journey is to be headed for

wonders of the machine age

continued from page 

  i have given these few examples only to show why
people should keep a jevcl head in these days of
stress and not become unduly excited about the fu-
ture the machinc age and applied science far from
destroying humanity is now and will forever be
humanitys servant

  i will go on record and btato that with very few
exceptions practically all useful inventions and useful
machines so far invented have not only helped the
human race socially but have been the direct
cause of keeping millions of people em-
ployed it is the common talk of the misinformed
as well of the so-called informed classes that the pre-
sent unemployment situation is due to the machine
the argument runs something as follows

  a factory gives employment to a thousand men a
new invention is made and new machinery is installed
in this plant which then does twice as much work
with half the men half of the men are thrown out
of employment consequently the new machine has
been destructive in that it put  men out of
work

  this argument is pure foolishness for u its pro-
ponent stopped to think about it he could reason that
the argument of necessity was wrong there is not
a single useful machine or invention which has not
given actual employment in the course of time and
actually created employment where none existed be-
fore

  in colliers the national weekly lately was a most
interesting article which i heartily recommend to all
it is entitled the job making machine by john t
flynn the author takes a single machine the auto-
mobile and cites the following facts which are not
fancy or hearsay but can be easily proved from re-
ports of the department of commerce and other in-
dustrial bodies for all who care to look into the
facts

  there are over a million men employed in the pro-
duction of automobiles and their components 
automobile factory workers  automobile parts
workers  tire workers  in blast fur-
naces and steel mills  in the production of
coppet and other metals  lumbermen and wood
workers  in the production of textiles glass
and other materials  producing coal and power
there are  making and marketing automobile
accessories

  then too there are  dealers and sales-
men  garage and service men 
chauffeurs and cabmen  truck and bus driv-
ers

  the total of those who derive their employment
from the automotive industry and automotive opera-
tion reaches four and a half millions an increase of

	in the past five years i the automobiles
use more steel than any other industry-more than
tho united states produced thirty years ago their
tires use more cotton than was used for all purposes
thirty years ago there are  men employed
in the production of gasoline  in road build-
ing and maintenance on tho railroads  are
employed through the transportation of motor cars
vast amounts of building construction have been
brought about by the extended radius of travel which
the automobile has given to the public

  i have chosen the automobile industry says mr
flynn to illustrato what is going on in industry as
a result of the machine because its effects are visi-
ble on a large scale but what is true of the automo-
wonder stqrjies



wonders of the machine age

bile is true in a smaller way of many other indus-
tries

  now then the automobile is only one machine
but the same case could be built up for any other
useful machine be it the steam engine the printing
press the radio or thousands of others

  it is perfectly true that a new and revolutionary
invention or a labor-saving machine may throw out
of employment temporarily some people no one
denies this you cannot have revolutions without a
temporary loss of some kind but the point is that
the  men thrown out of employment whom i men-
tioned above are not going to be out of employment
forever they will find other jobs -probably created
directly or indirectly by the very machine that threw
them out of work originally our present civiliza-
tion is so interdependent as a little thought on the
subject must convince the most skeptical that m the
final analysis the machine and applied science will
make emjdoyment for them

  what most people are apt to forget is that there
were unemployment crises long before there was a
machine age and that there have been unemploy-
ment cycles from the earliest recorded civilization
down to the present day more than  years ago
there was certainly no machine age yet there were
world-wide depressions and unemployment cycles then
just as we have them today

  famines pestilence and other scourges were the
usual thing long before the machine age when there
was no machine to put the blame on today thanks
to the machine age we no longer have country-wide
famines of the severity of the past and thanks to
science we no longer have the scourges and pesti-
lences that our ancestors had to contend with quick
communication by rail water and air tends to do
away with both acute famine and widespread dis-
eases

  it is admitted as i said before that new mach-
ines new inventions may temporarily throw people
out of employment but within a few years this
situation rectifies itself to the benefit of all con-
cerned it is even conceivable that the machine age
in the end will do away with business cycles how-
ever since business fluctuations are caused princi-
pally by human nature it may take centuries and
indeed thousands of years before the millenium is
reached-if ever

  all nature runs in cycles just as the sun has
its sunspots in a regular cycle just as the earth
lias its cyclcs of earthquakes and cycles of drought
just so economics will have its cycles-its ups and
downs there are many causes to which the present
unemployment situation is attributable for they re
world-wide and are just as acute in the non-mech-
anized countries as they are in the more industrial
ones we need not go into these causes because i
really believe that no one knows all of them

  certainly the machine age is not an important
cause and if we did not have our machine civiliza-
tion it is quite certain that the depression would be
far more severe than it is today it is certain that
the cycle would as it has done in past ages run for
a longer period than it does today

  the reason is that the causes of all of our trou-
bles lie not in the machine but are really found in
human nature when people start to hoard their
money when they are afraid of their own shadow
and when they tremble at the future for no reason
at all the machine certainly cannot be blamed

  for my part i have always felt that the present
depression is purely psychological rather than physi-
cal and in the last analysis it probably will be found

ss

  what has all of this got to do with science
fiction i just this

  science fiction is based upon the progress of science
that is its very foundation without it
there could be no science fiction

  on the other hand science fiction is supposed to
portray and mirror the future as reasonably as it is
possible to do from our present perspective

  if you admit that machines and science are all
wrong and that they are destroying humanity then
there should be no such thing as science fiction and
it would be useless to preach the gospel of science

i feel most strongly on the subject because during
recent months we have received a number of science

wonders of the machine age

    f	continued from page 

fiction stories probably fostered by the unemployment
atmosphere which i have rejected because they dis-
torted the facts and in many cases were pure out-
and-out propaganda against the machine age

  some of the authors who should know better main-
tained in their stories that little by little the mach-
ines and science are becoming a frankenstein mon-
ster and finally humanity will rise in revolt and
destroy all the machines and go back to the middle
ages the usual underlying plot is that because of
capitalistic concentration of wealth the machines will
be ultimately controlled by a few powerful men who
will enslave the entire world to the detriment of hu-
manity

  i have gone to great length in my opening para-
graphs to show that this situation has never arisen
as yet and from past experience we know that it
cannot arise and it is for this reason that won-
der stories win not in the future publish pro-
paganda of this sort which tends to inflame an un-
reasoning public against scientific progress against
useful machines and against inventions in general

  it is conceivable and indeed is proved by history
that nations are born grow to maturity and die
this has happened through our entire recorded his-
tory it probably will repeat itself indefinitely in
the future which nations will survive e have no
means of foretelling of course when it happens
the machine age will be blamed again and the auth-
ors of the assertions will be blissfully ignorant of
the fact that other nations living alongside of them
prosper and grow while living in the self-same mach-
ine age

   it is indeed quite within the bounds of possibility
that humanity will at some future time find itself
back in the middle ages-or worse this also has
happened in the past and may conceivably happen
again if it does happen the causes will probably be
due to great cataclysms such as floods and earth-
quakes or wars but the machine age will have very
little or nothing to do with it

 humanity will have its ups and downs in the future
as it had in the past

  i am however of the firm opinion that as the
past  years have shown because of science and
the machine age the ups and downs of humanity
will be less severe than they wero before the machine
age and that is the reason why i have no patience
with those who tend to preach the evils of the mach-
ine age which in the long run are non-existent

 willi gail  pages illustrated stiff
 cloth covers size  x  publish-
 ed by sears publishing company new
 york price 

  the interplanetary stories of otto willi gail are
well known to wonder stories readers-the shot
into infinity appearing in the fall  and the
stone from the moon in the spring  issues of
the quarterly

  the present volume is written in the same stylo as
those mentioned the story is simple it concerns
the introduction of a detroit newspaper reporter into
his crew of space flyers to the moon oy one hans
hardt tommy bighead our reporter being de-
prived of the privilege of a passenger naturally stows
away the scenes on the journey the experiences of
the crew the discovery of a lunar satellite all are
written in the realistic style for which gail is well
known facts are never distorted by him no im-
possible lunar creatures no heavenly paradise awaits
our explorers but a grim struggle with pitless nature

  the style is easy and rapid and the story moves
alony with facility the works of gail are reminis-
cent of those of verne and are bound to become
popular for they serve not only to clarify the es-
sentials of the space flight problem but also to give
some of its possibilities for adventure romancc and
glory unequalled by any other human activity

creation by evolution-a sympo-
 sium edited by frances mason  pages
 stiff cloth covers illustrated size x
 published by macmillan company new
 york price 

  the existence of a symposium such as this on the
vital topic of evolution should put an end to nil loose
discussion of so pertinent a subject-loose that is in
the sense of being uninformed and based on conclu-
sions hastily drawn from information imperfectly as-
similated there has been a great need of a vol-
ume of this kind for the average layman knows noth-
ing of the wealth of scientific research and justifica-
tion for the theory of creation by evolution an
amazing number of reasonably well educated persons
sum up the vast idea of progressive selection with
the pat definition that man is descended from the
monkey a phrase as misleading as it is stereotyped

  that evolution is still a controversial subject the
authors have taken into account they have attempt-
ed to reconcile it with existing beliefs a rather futile
task more important however every side of the
question is presented fully clearly and in interesting
and logical sequence

  the factors in the theory of evolution which has
growth from the egg to maturity reviews the history
it arc roughly four the circumstances of heredity
variation selection and segregation this generous
volume contains articles on all four phases on evolu-
tion as we may see it occurring about us on vesti-
gial organs in man and the lower animals the factor
of segregation is taken up in an article on the geo
graphical distribution of animals which contains some
surprising facts one of which for instance is that
camels once roamed over the continent of north amer-
ica also the intriguing theory of recapitulation
which embodies the idea that every aninyil in its
growth from the egg to maturity reviews the history
of the race is covered in some detail

  enich article is complete in itself and the book mav
be opened at any point to be read with satisfaction
such authorities as henry fairfield osborn david
starr jordan and julian huxley have contributed to
this collection of essays on the idea of the survival
of the fittest treated in all its ramifications

under the north pole by sir hub-
 ert wilkins  pages illustrated stiff
 cloth covers size  vi x  published
 by brewer warren and putnam new
 york price 

  with captain wilkins ready to start out on what

may be the most exciting exploration of the decade
a book such as the present which presents the back-
ground of the expedition the personnel of the sub-
marine and the aims of the cruise is very timely

  the life history of wilkins which composes one
part of this volume is in itself a wonder story the
struggles of the young australian to obtain an edu-
cation against great difficulties his turning toward
aviation during its early years his successive con-
quests of the poles although recounted by him with
characteristic modesty presents a picture exciting
as it is epochal

  his story is filled with the life-long attempt to
find a means of predicting weather conditions for
man so that he need not be continually at the mercy
of the elements wilkins own tory of his youth-
of the bufferings of his family and fellowmen in aus-
tralia during a prolonged drought served to vividly
impress upon his mind what must be done

  the present expedition of the submarine nautilus
therefore is a fitting culmination of his work in
polar exploration which has lasted for over fifteen
years

  with calm lucidity that only intensifies the drama
of it wilkins recounts the stories of his earlier
expeditions in the arctic and antarctic yet from
the lessons of them he believes that his present voyage
stands a good chance of success as he states he is
prepared for most every eventuality although the un-
foreseen may suddenly emerge from the tides of
chance to bring disaster

  the book which contains also short sketches of the

  has become first rank among the

   the literary perfection of his work is
   undeniable 

   his tales   are so starkingly true

   he remains and will remain a master

the gambler

 he gambles that a lucky break will
 come to him in the course of time

ost men live in the hope that their lucky break will
come tomorrow or next week or next yeae

they gamble that fate some day some way will make
them rich they risk their whole lives on what may come to
them in the course of time

    this is a worse form of gambling than gambling for
money with a card sharp or a three shell game expert

    gambling on what time and fate have in store for you
is more costly than any other form of gambling known

    you lose more than money you lose your self-
respect you lose the self-respect of those about you

    and as each year passes your chance to amount to any-
thing becomes slimmer and slimmer

     you get discouraged you begin to feel that fate is against
you you complain secretly about your ill luck perhaps you hide
your shortcomings behind a whole flock of easy excuses

     but the hard cold world doesnt care about you

    youve got to look out for yourself

     time alone cannot help you if it could every man over
 would be rich

     you cannot count on luck or fate or circumstances if you
could everybody would get rich at some time or other

     your life is too precious to waste away waiting for some-
thing to turn up

    theres one sure way-yes only one sure way-to
get what you want out of life

     nothing can help you but your own brain make your brain
just a little bit more effective and you will multiply your
earning power

     there is no limit to what the human brain can accomplish
scientists and psychologists tell us we use only about ten per
cent of our brain power ninety per cent is unused it lies
dormant the longer it is unused the harder it becomes for us
to use it for the mind is like a muscle it grows in power
through exercise and use it weakens and deteriorates with
idleness

    what can you do about it that is the question you are
asking yourself here is a suggestion

junior plano course

  have yon ever heard of the u s
school of music i asked

 a few of my friends nodded
thats a correspondence school
isnt it they exclaimed

  hxiiuly i replied they have
a surprisingly easy method through
which you can learn to play any
instrument by mail in just a few
months without a teacher

  it doesnt seem possible some-
one said

  thats what  thought too but
the free demonstration lesson which
they mailed me on request so opened
my eyes that i sent for the complete
course

  it was simply wonderful - no
laborious scales-no heartless exer-
cises my fear of note disappeared
at the very beginning as the lessons
came they got easier and easier
before i knew it i was playing all
the pieces i liked best

  thun i told them how i had al-
ways longed to sit down at the piano
and play some old sweet song-or
perhaps a beautiful classic a bit
from an opera or the latest syncopa-
tion - how when i
heard others playing i
envied them so that it
almost spoiled the
pleasure of the music
for me-how i was
jealous because they
could entertain their
friends and family

  music was always
one of those never-to-
come-true dreams until
the u s- school came
to my rescue believe
me no more heavy
