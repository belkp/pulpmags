novelette-complete
somewhere in france
chapter i	stream of retreating french from jet
      black eyes that gave to his gaunt
deeply-tanned face the look of a brood-
 r y god said sergeant spurr ing eagle a high crooked nose
r  them frawgs is shore a slightly twisted by the storms of a too
frazzled lookin bunch of hom- turbulent youth further strengthened
bres he stood above the road gazing the impression he also had that
with absorbed interest at the steady aquiline faculty of seeing everything
m
brothers in red

without appearing to in age he
might have been anywhere between
forty-five and sixty for his thin hair
was of an iron gray
  every detail of the retreating troops
told him a tale of defeat more vividly
than could printed columns and his
brow clouded as he watched the bat-
tered pitiful procession climbing from
the valley amid a drifting pall of
powdery white dust
  spurr pushed his rabbit back from
his broad forehead and turned to his
companion
   look thar lance he said point-
ing to a staggering bearded figure in a
tattered blue uniform which was towed
along on its feet by a bit of rope from
an overloaded fourgon wagon  that
bucks beat out i allow them troops
hev been in action two weeks an more
-jedgin by their whiskers aint seen
a clean shaved walk-a-lot in the herd
barrin that fat colonel awhile ago
  corporal lance turned his copper-
huecl visage away from the horizon
toward the road while his eyes rippled
over the dejected mass on the highway
like heat lightning  a july night
deliberately he crossed his hands on the
muzzle of his springfield and stood
looking with splendid head outstretched
and silhouetted against the deepening
sky
   yeh been in battle two suns gone
grunted the indian at length  look
at un wounds all white by edge-no
fresh blood
  steadily the stream of men in blue
trudged on silently doggedly hollow
eyes on the ground with heavy feet
moving in a dragging shuffle
   yep and thats war as she is fit to-
day remarked sergeant spurr to his
silent companion  not much like the
hide-n-go-seek we o the fifth cavalry
used to play with yore daddy red
lance now thar was a war what was
a war-i allow im plumb feeble-
minded to desert my stnilin acres to go
gallivantin back to a kind o war i
dont know nuthin about-
   corporal lance turned an inscrutable
face
    when the war drum beat he said
 then do the young braves most need
the council of the old men-johnny
spurr is a warrior wise with years-
   thanks lance murmured the
sergeant  but i allow im too much
of an old-timer for this kind o war
aint no trackin nor scoutin nor
fancy shootin spect they let me keep
my stripes account o my service rec-
ord concluded the veteran bitterly
    let johnny spurr be patient ad-
vised the indian  before we dance
about the smoking villages of the hi-
nees there will come a need for the
skill of sergeant spurr
   mebbe so mebbe so agreed the
ex-rancher with a wry smile which be-
lied conviction
    for some moments they stood on the
high bank which afforded an excellent
view of the road as it stretched down
from the wooded heights on which the
solitary american battalion found it-
self to a wide rolling plain that ter-
minated on the distant horizon at the
foot of some low blue-tinted hills it
seemed as if all the armies of france
were retiring along that firm white
thread of road so crowded it was
   at length tired of watching the dis-
heartening spectacle the two retired to
the shade of a beech tree and propping
themselves up against its silvery trunk
eased their packs to the ground about
them the men of spurrs platoon
sprawled in weird and ungainly posi-
tions as they smoked napped or gam-
bled as suited their fancy but the
great majority slept
   eatin or smokin  inquired
spurr and tendered a frayed plug
which he dislodged from his back
pocket
   smokin grunted lance and
turning over on his stomach proceeded
to roll a cigarette his back luxuriously
turned to the warm june sunlight
    the old sun shore does feel good
dont she observed the sergeant j

argosy-allstory weekly
aint been warm sence we put foot to
this gawd-forgot country nohow
lance passed a wiry hand over his
thick blue-black hair and filled his
broad chest until the buttons on the
front of his o d blouse groaned and
tugged at the restraining buttonholes
   too many clothes he remarked
as he settled back  injun no fight
good with clothes on-keep muscles
tight no can breathe
  between the tree trunks the waning
sun glanced warmly tinting the early
summer leaves a bright emerald color
and somewhere near by a courageous
thrush trilled softly through half-
shut eyes spurr watched a gorgeous
red and black butterfly drift slowly past
as though there were no war nearer
than a thousand miles
   aint he purty though he mur-
mured half to himself  just like the
little fellers thome-by the bank of the
gray hoss-i war a fool to leave it at
my age
 suddenly lance sat up his dark
glistening eyes wide as he watched the
insects flight he pointed a muscular
bronze hand at it
   bad medicine johnny spurr he
said  red and black-color of the
war path-to-morrow will be raised the
war cry i think many among us will
take the great trail his eyes glanc-
ing up rested on a great white billow-
ing cloud that lay torpid in the vivid
blueness of the evening sky  our
braves too anxious-no wise on the
warpath
  with a studied carelessness spurr
aimed at a discarded shoe some ten
feet distant and spat with deadly ac-
curacy before answering
   a word o advice lance he
warned  dont air them sentiments
promiscuous like-most o these hom-
bres with us are like the pup in his
basket-all their troubles are ahaid of
em twont do a mite o good and
itd make a sartin redskin o my ac-
quaintance as popular as a rattler at a
church sociable
  suddenly among the dull clank and
claftter of accouterment from the high-
way came a new sound like the putter-
ing of a motor boat on a distant lake
steadily the sound came nearer until a
dispatch rider heavily coated with dust
pushed his motor cycle through the
swearing sweating troops and came to
a halt at the bottom of the bank with
a squealing of brakes and the scuffling
of heavy-soled shoes
   hey there you sleepin beauties
he shouted wheres the th
now you guess shouted a voice
from the underbrush in a lisping fal-
setto  we just love games in this
outfit
  whereupon the dusty rider uttered
several pungent remarks upon the
speakers family looks and private
amusements then addressed himself to
spurr who sat with long dust-covered
legs stretched out before him thought-
fully gnawing a stem of grass
   wal he said at length  thars
some o the th down yonder he
jerked a thumb at the other side of the
road thars some in veetree le
chattoo and thars a lot more in jail in
paris and thars some of us hyar
which part was you lookin for
pertickler
  the man on the motor cycle blinked
wrathfully and waved a gauntleted fist
in spurrs direction dont be a
damned fool he snarled  youre
holdin up important orders i gotta
find general kent pronto snap out
of it-wheres he at
   wal why didnt you say so
afore  chided the sergeant  hes
yonder spurr pointed to a group of
officers some distance from the road-
sidewho clustered over a field map and
strained their eyes by the fading light
   chuck the shut-eye lance said
spurr as he studied the generals face
while the latter read the messengers
information  the war chiefs a-
pullin of his whiskers-i smell trouble
in the air
  suddenly he became conscious that
brothers in red

 the officers were regarding him and his
 companion with more than ordinary
 interest the suddenly suspicious vet-
 eran hastily reviewed his activities of-
 ficial and otherwise for the past two
 weeks with apprehension he recalled
 a game of three-card monte at which a
 battery from pennsylvania left most
 of their spare change
   presently a spick and span orderly
 detached himself from the conclave and
 ran up to the beech tree
    report to general kent at once
 he said a malicious grin on his face
   i reckon that little monte game you
 cleaned up has come home to roost
   silently spurr arose stowed his
 quid in a leathery cheek and buttoned
 his blouse while lance smiled broadly
 and composed himself to further rest
   no you dont said the orderly
  the general wants you too
    who me  lances eyes were
 mere slits above his high cheek bones as
 he looked up with an air of grave
 surprise
   yep they aint but one corporal
 lance in this outfit that i knows of
 youre it so get a wiggle on i tell you
 the generals pulling his mustache
   setting their caps straight the two
 westerners marched up to where the
 white-haired general stood writing
 busily in a little notebook lie ignored
 their neatly executed salutes while he
 finished the dispatch then looked up
 his gray eyes hard and serious
    ive a serious matter concerning
 you two men he announced and
 ill want no interruptions while i so
 into it
thirty years ago had spurr learned
that one may expect anything to hap-
pen in the armed forces of the united
states so he wasted no nervous energy
in unhappy conjectures he glanced
across at lance the corporal stood
lithe body taut in the coarse olive drab
uniform with his finely chiseled fea-
tures utterly impassive he might have
been made of the bronze his skin re-
sembled
    	by golly thought spurr for the
hundredth time that bucks a
throwback to days afore the paleface
diseases and firewater rooined the in-
juns health and morals hes skeert
but he dont show his feelins none
for a moment the general spoke with
a member of his staff then stood look-
ing from one to the other his mouth
grim and forbidding
   youre indian of course said
kent addressing lance
    proudly the corporal lifted his head
 looked the officer in the eyes and spoke
 with grave dignity
     yes sir red lance chief of the
osage nation-
    a slow smile crossed the veteran of-
 ficers lips and he pulled thoughtfully at
 his sweeping gray mustache
     pure bred 
    almost haughtily the indian made
reply
    sir since long before we penned in
 reservation my people chiefs
 suddenly the officer whirled on spurr
 whose active mind was already search-
 ing for a reason for the sudden sum-
 mons
 and you 
    wal sir folks allow mv great-
granddaddy was creek replied spurr
on a sudden impulse  i allow thars
where i get my injun looks
a  thin nervous-looking captain
wearing an h o brassard stepped for-
ward and raised a neatly gloved hand
he looked with disgustat the strange
pair
    as i said before general i think
 it s a great mistake sending these men
 he said in high almost querulous tones
every one knows you cant trust an
indian theyre no damn good any
more-all rotters living off the govern-
ment besides-
 quite abruptly the captains voice
died away as general kents hand fell
like a hammer on his wrist anxiously
spurr noted that red lances hand had
strayed to the collar of his blouse he
braced himself for a spring

argosy-aixstory weekly
   you may have learned a lot as a
military attache captain king kent
was saying coldly  but you havent yet
learned to keep your mouth shut on
matters you dont know the first thing
about now you two men come along
with me and ill settle this little matter
with you
  red lances hand dropped to his
side general kent turned his back on
the white-faced captain and led off
down the ravine to a clump of birches
at the far end a few yards behind
him came spurr and lance walking
side by side in subdued but earnest con-
versation
   an the next time lance spurr
was saying savagely  you reach for
yore collar ill take that knife away
from you what if youd speared that
thar tenderfoot officer now
   one fool less said lance darkly
then contritely he put out a hand
to his friend  but johnny spurr is
right-lance too a fool i came show
white man injun still good fighter
osage brave still take un war path and
kill un enemy
  satisfaction twinkled in spurrs eye
at the corporals change of tone
    yore right lance you caint lift
haar when yer six foot underground
he lowered his voice  remember
the ridge pole of yore lodge by the
gray hoss dont sport no scalp locks
none the same being against the rooles
of the great father but hyar the game
laws off an as ive told you afore
you can score all the coups you want
not that its joodicious to go spreading
the tidins about keerless like
chapter ii
a desperate expedient
at length the general halted and
 waited for the two straight si-
lently-moving figures to catch up
his arms folded above the triple row of
decorations and campaign medals that
covered his left pocket top then he
reached into a stained leather map case
and unfolded a map which was crossed
and recrossed with lines in various
colors
    come over to this stone he di-
rected  and ill give you an idea of
what youve got ahead he looked
up suddenly his blue eyes narrowing
 that is-if youll volunteer i dont
order men to go on forlorn hopes
   shrewdly spurr studied his officer
    i caint live forever sir he said
  ill go
   the general sat down spreading the
map on his lap while spurr peered over
his shoulder and lance squatted along-
side his jet black eyes fixed on spurr
  kent turned to red lance  and
you 
  the indian laid a hand on spurrs
shoulder
   where goes johnny spurr there
goes red lance
    smoke if you want to said kent
 im not a stickler on etiquette i
guess the west does away with it 
   he lit a pipe and commenced his in-
structions while red patches of the sun-
set climbed slowly up the snowy bark
of the birches and the smoke from the
rolling kitchens settled lower and lower
at the far end of the ravine very
shortly darkness would descend but on
the road the struggling column ebbed
steadily southward
    its a hundred to one shot said
kent  and youll be doing miracles if
you get the job half done now you
know theres still time to change
your minds how about it
   but the ex-rancher and his compan-
ion remained silent their eyes on the
map
    men commenced the veteran  as
we all can see the french have been
badly beaten theyre not to blame
theyve been fighting a heavy rear
guard action for two weeks and the
poor devils have suffered casualties that
would stagger the unbelief of satan
in a word theyre all in no reserves
no ammunition no spirit no nothing
brothers in red

theyre at the end of their tether news
has just come to brigade headquarters
that the french are being driven back
so fast that the rest of our division
wont have time to move into position
before the enemy attack
  spurr stood up and slipped his hands
in his back trousers pocket while his
eyes picked out with the skill of long
years of experience the outstanding
landmarks on the map
   in fact theyre so badly disor-
ganized went on the general in a voice
which did not attempt to disguise his
anxiety  that their retreat will become
a disastrous rout should the enemy at-
tack in force and his tone became
even more grave  we have positive in-
formation that the german high com-
mand has given orders for an attack at
four thirty to-morrow morning-
  calmly the sergeants voice inter-
rupted   and if they do attack its
hash for breakfast 
   precisely said general kent
 hash most unpleasant hash for
breakfast their high command knows
our main body isnt in position yet
consequently theyre doin everything
they can to put over that smashing blow
before the rest of us come up
  red lance squatted on his heels ap-
parently incapable of understanding the
importof kents rapid flow of speech
his eyes were shut like those of a cat
while the last parting ravs of sunlight
put living colors into his bronzed
savage face with high lights flash-
ing on the ridge of his high cheek-
bones
  spurrs brow wrinkled as he stooped
and plucked a fresh blade of grass
then he addressed his superior
   wal now ef the general dont
mind i got a idear he drawled
 theys nigh onto a thousand o us
yanks here ahaid o the rest why
caint our bucks throw a little bluff-a
raid and mebbe score some coups that
will throw the fear o god into the
heinies we-all jest might stall them
hostiles off long enough-
  but general kent shook his tired
gray head impatiently and dug his boot
heel into the tender new grass at his
feet
    its a good idea sergeant he said
 but it wont work trust the german
intelligence to foresee a stunt like
that
   why whatve they done 
  a very clever piece of work
theyve built up an impression a real
belief among the men in the ranks that
there are practically no americans in
this part of france theyve gone even
further- kent suddenly looked up
at the brown old veteran who stood
gazing earnestly at the map  do you
know how the plain german soldier
pictures an american
  spurr shook his head slowly
 shore i caint sir but i presoom its
considerable oncomplimentary
   they think were all like him
general kent thrust a brown finger at
red lance who only rocked on his
heels and blinked uniformed in
paint and feathers like the old-style
redskins you fought in your young
days i expect
  reproachfully spurr stared at his
general
    wal sir he said quietly  im an
old-timer and im kinder slow on some
matters i know but i aint too oldor
slow not to know when im being made
a fool of
  his deep-set eyes cold and chilling
general kent glanced up but as hfi
caught the hurt expression on spurrs
leathery face his expression softened
    stop it sergeant stop that kind of
talk he snapped  im not making
a fool of ou i admit it sounds ri-
diculous but the power of propaganda
is great and only when this damned
war is over will we ever realize how
great it is
  propaganda sir whats that
asked spurr vaguely
   never mind now listen carefully
to what im going to say kent looked
away down the ravine to where the

argosy-allstory weekly
battalion was making ready for night-
fall  mind you the fate of this par-
ticular division and another rests on
your shoulders-forty thousand lives
and-and-god knows its a terrible
responsibility for you to assume but
its got to be risked
  slowly spurrs tired old shoulders
straightened themselves under his ill-
fitting o d blouse and he raised his
hand in the old-fashioned army salute
the salute that was in vogue when
geronimo and the prophet figured in
the headlines
  quickly with the same salute kent
returned it a ghost of a smile
twitched his gray mustache as he said
 i was just a green shave-tail fresh
from the point when that salute went
out guess were both old timers i
prefer those days when war was some-
thing beside scientific wholesale mur-
der
  he pulled himself up
    well heres the plan its essen-
tial that the germans the plain soldiers
be convinced that the americans have
really arrived on this front it would
badly damage their morale
  he leveled his eves at those of the
old plainsman  to do as you sug-
gest and send the battalion over would
do no good why because the of-
ficers would tell their men that these
were english canadians and aus-
tralians dressed in american uniforms
and the men would believe them
theyve been trained to but if two or
three men men who can do real stalk-
ing and scouting could get through
into the german lines and let them-
selves be seen as american indians in
war paint and feathers it would be
the most effective kind of counter-
propaganda no power on earth could
stop the german masses from realizing
that the americans were in the lines
theyd see with their own eyes and
no amount of lying on the part of their
officers could shake their belief it d
raise hell with their morale do you
see
   as the general revealed the import
of his plan and its possibilities pre-
sented themselves in spurrs crafty
brain he suddenly leaped in the air
cracked his heels together and let out
a blood-freezing yell that brought the
somnolent red lance springing to his
feet knife in hand
    comanche yell wasnt it grinned
kent as spurr suddenly abashed
flushed painfully  had the real old
ring but dont do it again youll start
a young panic among the french i
see he added dryly  that youve got
my idea
    yes sir said red lance prompt-
ly and sank once more to his heels
    i think three men will be enough
continued kent with a glance at his
map  one to stay behind and act as
relay-you two to do the real work
ive sent lieutenant jones to find an-
other man who looks like an indian
meanwhile study this map a single
error will mean disaster so get the
terrain in your mind and for gods
sake get it right
   obediently spurr gazed at the map
which was already growing familiar
kent pulled a lead pencil from his
pocket
    see that line  its the road be-
low us and this is where we are-
thats courcelles just south of us now
whats this
    the battle line sir replied spurr
promptly
    right youll try to get into the
german lines near this old farmhouse
their first line should be behind the
railroad shown here your job should
be easier now that were out of the
trench systems youll have some
cover wheat young trees and shrub-
bery most of the way to rubescourt
how fur is it queried the ser-
geant	if
    about three miles i should say
estimated the general after a hurried
reference to the scale  avoid show-
ing yourselves until youre well inside
the german lines it  be hard as
brothers in red

the enemy is heavily concentrated all
the way along your route
   by the way they believe an in-
dian can do almost miraculous things
in the way of getting by unseen they
also think of them as utterly merciless
terribly strong and enduring but one
thing his voice became hoarsely
grave  dont get caught i dont
know what theyd do to you-and
afterward youd get shot without
further arguments so when it comes to
shooting shoot first and last about
your shooting im not worrying i see
three bad cuts on your revolver butt
  kent felt a sudden sense of confi-
dence in the alert young-old man who
stood there so quietly listening to
words which would have made ninety-
nine men in a hundred gasp in fear
if he failed as there was every rea-
son to believe he would in such a hope-
less undertaking it would not be the
fault of sergeant spurr but of odds
too great for human powers to over-
come
   now comes the almost impossible
part of the whole damn thing gen-
eral kents face loomed white in the
gathering darkness  its imperative
that you capture a high ranking officer
a major or colonel at least-you can
tell them by the heavy braid shoulder
straps and their nasty manners
   i allow sir i couldnt mistake their
manners none- spurr broke off short
as kents eyes met his
   how youll get him back i wont
pretend to tell you for the life of me
i dont see how you can even get into
the enemy lines i know i couldnt
and im no tenderfoot theyve got
their whole area swarming with pickets
and patrols
   its a tough assignment and ive
picked you and corporal lance here
as the men best fitted one of yous
an honest-to-god redskin and you say
youre part indian you can both go
silently where the ordinary man would
make noises like a skeleton on a tin
roof further you know how to take
cover and you know how an indian
should act stop at nothing to be con-
vincing
chapter iii
the third indian
some three hours later a french
artillery captain straying from the
road put his head into a tumbled-
down cow-shed not far from the ridge
on which was bivouacked the american
battalion as his eyes pierced the
gloom he stared an instant then with
a wail of frantic terror turned and
bolted headlong away from that abode
of demons inside the shed a co-
manche brave lifted his ochre and
black-striped face and laughed until the
long braids of his blue-black hair
swung to and fro
   shore now lance chuckled
spurr  that frawgs like to hit paris
afore dawn ef he keeps at the rate he
was burnin the sod hold still now
ye varmint i aim to paint this thun-
der-bird on yore left breast plumb
ferocious-lookin
  corporal red lance worked his
naked shoulders happily causing a
triple row of bears claws-made of
white pine-to clatter pleasantly about
his black and red painted ncck from
the tip of his moccasins hastily im-
provised from an old leather duffel bag
to the crest of his gorgeous war bonnet
his muscles rippled free and unham-
pered it was a happy moment for
red lance
  johnny spurr looks as did my
father when he took the war trail
against the utes he smiled admiring-
ly as the horribly-painted sergeant bent
over him to apply the finishing touches
under his skillful fingers the osages
features became a mask of savage
ferocity dimly seen in the feeble rays
of a smoking lantern the plainsman
himself was clad only in an improvised
breech clout wound about his thin
muscular waist which had been stained

to a deep reddish brown by the liberal
application of leather dye
  squatting on an up-ended grenade
case general kent and another officer
watched the preparations curiously
glancing occasionally at their watches
   now where in hell is jones with
that other man general kent fumed
 i ought to have known better than
to send that misbegot chump- he
threw a glance over to the two men
now almost finished with their prepara-
tions and conceded that their get-up
was as near perfect as the conditions
would allow for a moment the vet-
eran felt himself carried back to those
days in arizona when geronimos
savages were harrying the countryside
it seemed hard to believe that all this
was taking place in civilized france
   what an eye for art youve got
sergeant said the other officer  id
have the willies if you jumped at me
  modestly spurr readjusted three tall
eagle feathers-wrenched from a pro-
testing farmers gander-among the
black coils of the wig-borrowed from
a y m c a troupe in the back area-
and stepped into the dull light of the
lantern beside him towered corporal
lance his black and red striped fea-
tures ghastly and weird as heart-chill-
ing and ominous a buck as ever caused
a frontiersman to pray that his prim-
ing was dry on the osages broad
chest rose and fell a breastplate im-
promised of willow twigs and beads
filched from the library lamp of a near-
by chateau like two hawk-faced
blood-thirsty braves from a reming-
ton painting the pair stood with bowie
knives glinting in their hands but with
very modern automatics and hand
grenades in the fringed and painted
medicine bags that dangled from their
belts
  on the threshold was heard a step
and kent rose to his feet with a mur-
mured  thank god jones at last
  the door opened to admit an anx-
ious-eyed lieutenant who stepped in and
saluted
   sir he began  ive combed the
whole battalion for something that
looks like an indian-
  general kents eyes flashed fire as
he stepped forward and thundered
 dont you dare tell me youve wasted
three hours for nothing
  with a backward step the lieuten-
ant held up a warding hand
   no sir i-i-i found one hes
outside
  crisply the man was ordered in
   so hilf me gott whined a voice
outside  i aindt done noddings
   get in there a stern voice and
the sound of a boot being lustily ap-
plied preceded the appearance of a
short round-shouldered little man
whose ears heavy lips and curling
black locks proclaimed him a child of
shem there was nothing aboriginal
about him but his nose it was the
nose of an indian like the beak of
a proud and fearless eagle it swept
down in a majestic curve
   oi oi shrilled the newcomer as
he caught sight of spurr and lance
 is this a cigar store yet
  struggling to hide his mirth the
general outlined his plans to the new-
comer this done he whirled on the un-
happy private who snapped to rigid
attention
  whats our name asked kent
while the israelite brooded darkly on
the disaster which had befallen him
   moe slafsky sir slafskys splen-
did suitinks he said with a deter-
mined effort to keep his hands at his
sides  please mister-sir i mean
dunt esk i should go it aindt right
no i aindt going-i-i owe some
moneys would you make of me a
cheater with out-thrust palms slaf-
sky pleaded his small eyes rolling un-
happily about the shed  say no and
ill make the general the finest uni-
form in the a e f vouldnt you
please say no 
    its too late to get some one else
growled kent to the lieutenant  so
liell just have to go
brothers in red

   while the private stunned by his
 fate submitted limply the guards as
 one man fell upon the unhappy moe
 and in a trice they bereft him of his
 clothing
  oi he wailed mein pents i
vont go widdoud mein pents please
mister general couldnt i just keep
mine pents id catch cold-
   the general smilingly shook his head
 as a layer of shoe stain was applied
 to slafskys milk-white skin
    you can leave him to wait just in-
 side the german lines suggested kent
  if you and lance dont return by
 four oclock hes to come back and re-
 port to me  well know youve been
 captured and act accordingly god help
 us with a sigh of deep anxiety kent
 dropped to the grenade case again
   a kindly soul produced a flask of
 cognac powerful and stimulating even
 by the teaspoonful and prevailed upon
 the still reluctant  indian  to take a
 long pull  itll keep you warm he
 said
   lieutenant jones swore  whatll
 we do theres no wig for him he
 cant go over with a brakemans hair-
 cut like that
    then i aindt goink hope welled
 in moe slafskys citv-loving breast he
 snatched up his trousers tenderly
  you kin roach his haid like a
greeks they dont sport har none
whatsoever suggested spurr heart-
lessly with the aid of horse-clippers
from an abandoned artillery caisson
the fell deed was done only a ridge
running from front to back was left
   moe reached out a shaking hand for
 the flask of cognac and took another
 long pull
    hey you lay offn that cried
 the owner  youll be tightern a new
 pair o boots
  a strange assurance appeared in
si a f sky as the last of the war paint
was being applied he looked loftily
about the shed and toyed with the neck-
lace which dangled from his neck
   yell ill go he said  vy not
  ve jews vas always scrappers look
at joshua david and-lots of others
in his round little eyes a belligerent
gleam appeared and for an instant
his face seemed almost warlike he

flourish of his trench knife  im as

chapter iv
into hostile territory
the broad undulating valley of
the matz river lay strangely
still and silent after the rumble
and crash of artillery and the whining
screams of shells which had shattered
the daylight hours overhead a timid
icy moon shone forth unexpectedly
now and again from behind clouds
at such time rifle shots would stab the
stillness as some lurking patrol spied
another in the sudden light
  a warm wind smelling of dusty
grain blew gently down the valley and
cooled the surburned faces of the
troops which now lay exhausted wait-
ing for another dawn which would
launch them again at each others
throats
  it was exactly twelve oclock when
spurr led his companions out into the
waving wheat which hid the opposing
armies like drifting shadows he and
red lance made their way but moe
his teeth chattering like a drummers
 bones made sorry going of it if
there was a shell case to trip over he
found it if there was a loose stone
to dislodge moes foot found it un-
erringly he made more noise than
a moose in a windfall
   the fat cow makes the noise of a
regiment hissed red lance  let us
leave him
  but spurr shook his head  we
dont take him much further were al-
ready inside their lines

argosy-allstory weekly
  then to spurrs horror moe sat
down and in perfectly audible tones
announced that he was going back
  i should go on he asked of the
twinkling stars  no i coodnt i
dont vant lo be a hero and besides
mine life insurance is run out my
poor reba oi oi like a turning
rattlesnake the indian writhed back
and firmly red lances thumb and
forefinger met in moes windpipe
while a long thirsty blade glittered be-
fore his bulging eyes
  like a jet of steam escaping from
a valve the indians voice whispered in
his ear
   to-night i take five scalps-i have
sworn it you come quiet or yours is
first you come lie grasped the
trembling little mans scalp lock and
the keen point of his bowie pricked
the skin under moes left ear with
alacrity moe changed his mind
   soch a sclilimiel-he should be on
a reservation vet breathed moe to
himself as the little column proceeded
crawling on hands and knees among
the tall yellow ears whose tops swayed
gentlv in the night wind
  finally spufr halted and signed to
lance to join him
  hearem
   um agreed lance  five meb-
bc six hostile to right and ahead many
hostile further away to left-
   we-alls right among em so go
careful like breathed the sergeant and
smoothed the rustling feathers of the
tufted war bonnet which swayed on
red lances head after we pass
that fust line we can leave shakin
bull behind-even he can find his way
back
   ah-h-h cho-o-o ah-h-h cho-o-o
twice moe sneezed thunderously
while spurrs keen ears caught a di-
versity of sudden small sounds the
scrape of a boot on the ground the
 snick  of a rifle bolt drawn cautious-
ly back and the faint clicking of ac-
couterment
   sorry gents said moe in clear
apologetic tones  a straw tickled
mine nose i alvays sneeze ven-
  in the midst of his explanations a
black shape lobbed through the air and
fell with a thud into the wheat a yard
or so distant from it came a sound
which reminded spurr of the hiss of
an angry black snake with the speed
of released springs he and lance
scuttled forward and fell flat among
the wheat ears as a tremendous ex-
plosion lit up the scene with a flash of
an orange-colored light which revealed
every detail of the battered terrain a
wandering puff of wind brought a rank
acrid smell which made spurrs nostrils
crinkle
  hard upon the roar of the bursting
potato-masher grenade a sudden burst
of machine gun and rifle fire rippled
like the clatter of a giant riveting ma-
chine bullets sighed and whined about
the two scouts as they lay flat to the
earth cut stalks even fell athwart
their naked backs but as the fire slack-
ened they were already worming their
way forward with a speed almost un-
canny
   i allow the loud-mouths took the
big jump murmured spurr when the
noise died away  i caint hear him
movin none
  several times as they crawled for-
ward on all fours they passed corpses
german and french the dead were
indescribably noisome so hideously
bloated by their long exposure to the
hot summer sun that a sickening stench
wrenched at spurrs stomach
   ugh sniffed red lance when
they left a particularly malodorous pile
behind  it a bad fight when souls
of the dead wait so long for rest-
  wal so fur so good murmured
the sergeant as they lay in the shadow
of the wheat before them like a long
bare wall lay a railroad right of way
raised to a considerable height above
the earth level on its crest a twisted
mass of ties and rails made a gigantic
hurrahs nest and a dangerous place to
pass
brothers in red

  johnny spurr-
   yes
  red lances lithe figure loomed
close the feathers of his war bonnet
swaying forward like leaves in a wind
the moonlight glinted on his naked
back picking out the vertebrae with
subdued high lights as he dropped be-
side the plainsman
    when cross trail of iron horse sky
be behind if hostiles not blind as
gray owls in daytime they see us when
we pass over
   uh huh
   well then johnny spurr if red
lance get hit go on the war chief
has said we hold spirits of twenty thou-
sand braves on our knife points-their
ghosts torment us if fail
  silently spurr grasped the indians
hand
    yep thats our duty he replied
and ef i gits plugged jest you trot
along and leave old john to sing his
death song alone
  like two drifting shadows the
raiders darted up the side of the em-
bankment just as the moon reappeared
from a momentary blotting out to
the sergeant whose thumping heart
seemed to beat like a drum it appeared
impossible that they passed unnoticed
but they gained the shelter of the up-
rooted rails and spurr was breathing
a trifle more easily as they crouched
among the splintered ties he glanced
over the other side and his heart
stopped dead
   look at that he breathed and
red lance stiffened at his side
  just below them not fifteen feet
away was a mass of enemy infantry
sprawled on the ground like corpses
they seemed as they lay scattered in
groups and clumps waiting for the
dawn of a day which they believed
would end in a final triumph the
night wind drifting from the sleeping
troops brought the acid smell of sweaty
bodies long unwashed and the bitter
tang of musty leather so it was not
the mirage it appeared to be
  spurr and lance froze in their
tracks like hiding rabbits slowly
spurrs eye ranged up and down the
embankment and noted that some
twenty or thirty yards away a tongue
of shrubbery reached almost to the
right of way but at intervals sentries
marched back and forth their heavy
helmets hiding their faces in darkness
  to reach that tongue seemed utterly
impossible when the sergeant realized
that he and his companion would have
to crawl all the way along the skyline
twisting in and out like weasels among
the ties and rails he groaned mentally
as he touched his companion and
pointed to the shrubbery
   infinitely patient they inched their
way along the top craning at the sky
watching for a friendly cloudlet to veil
their progress then flattening with
every nerve taut when the mercilessly
white moonlight flooded ridge and
plain again only men born to the
forest could have begun such a stalk
and even their almost inhuman skill
could not avail the inevitable betrayal
to which their uncertain surroundings
committed them when they were
within twenty feet of their goal a tie
delicately balanced on another scraped
against spurrs naked shoulder and
fell with a resounding crash with the
sound the americans flattened to the
cinder-strewn ground and lay half
visible in the moonlight
    w er ist dort
    wer ist dort challenged a hoarse
voice as the men nearest the raiders
awoke snatched up rifles and peered
wildly about like a disturbed ant
heap the sleeping germans roused into
activity while the skin of spurrs side
crept in anticipation of the first singing
bullet which would put an end to their
desperate adventure
    wer ist dort repeated the voice
higher pitched and with more insist-
ence and the sergeants heart leaped
as he caught the familiar sound of a
rifle bolt snicking as it was drawn back
a wild thought seized him perhaps

argosy-allstory weekly
lie and red lance could spring up and
with a headlong dash gain the shelter
of the wheat on the side towards the
allied lines but the thought of
general kents cold gray eyes boring
into his held the plainsman in place
   three soldiers their rifles held ready
before them advanced cautiously to the
edge of the embankment and peered up
at the top spurr could see their white
faces ghastly in the half light with pot-
shaped helmets looming black
 a long moment they craned their
necks seeming to stare directly at him
  after a colloquy carried on in hoarse
whispers the three retraced their steps
with the sound of their feet crunching
away the blood commenced once more
to circulate in spurrs veins he
glanced out of the corner of his eye at
the osage and made out the outline of
his figure lying motionless among the
rails not even the skin over his ribs
moved
  an officer of some sort with drawn
automatic came marching up to the
sentry who had given the alarm spurr
could see it plainly as the moonlight
glinted on the short wicked-looking
barrel
  he spoke hurriedly with the sentry
and also advanced to the bank looked
up and turned back with a bitter curse
   der dummkopf he snarled sleep-
ily  was sic horten war der wind
spielend mit deni ianb
  while hope welled in the sergeants
painted breast the germans lay down
again and dropped off to sleep one by
one as the sentry resumed his post
tramping methodically up and down
but he scanned the top of the em-
bankment suspiciously for a long while
  at last the moon disappeared behind
a large cloud enabling the raiders to
gain a position immediately above the
point of shrubbery but as red
lance pointed out there was some
fifteen feet of bare ground to be
covered before they could gain the
shelter of the underbrush
  for a moment they halted then red
lance laid a warning hand on his com-
panions back and held up a large stone
expressively his eyes wandered to a
spot back of the sentry spurr divin-
ing his purpose nodded
  with a sudden heave the indian sent
the stone hurtling far off so that it fell
among the sleeping men and struck
one who awoke with a shrill cry of
alarm at once the sentinel whirled
about peering in the direction whence
the stone had landed while spurr and
lance glided down the bank and
plunged into the grateful shadows of
the rustling alders
  from then on their progress was
more rapid and they made good time
darting from shadow to shadow and
from tree to tree threading their way
among the sleeping hordes of gray-
coated enemies
  once they lay motionless while a
file of machine gunners grunting and
sweating under their heavy maxims
trudged sullenly by not three feet
away and once a mongrel cur spared
from slaughter yapped shrilly
chapter v
the raid
they had gone on for perhaps an
hour when the indian halted and
sniffed
   there is a hostile village ahead
murmured red lance at length  i
smell smoke
  then the moon came out and showed
a pile of ruins not far to their right
a white road led into it

colonel gent the big chief was askin
fer
  skirting the deserted road they
gained the edge of the town finding it
to be utterly shattered and apparently
tenantless but the smell of wood
smoke pervaded the crumbled black-
ened piles of masonry and belied its
seeming desertion
  red lance glided up to spurr and
pointed to a shell-racked house stand-
ing on the outskirts of the village and
together they commenced a cautious
advance in its direction as they came
closer their ears caught the sound of
voices singing in discord and exuber-
antly mingled with the scrape of a
violin the tune had the unrestrained
rudely sensual rhythm of a peasant
bacchanal
  darting from doorway to doorway
red lance led the way until they
crouched outside the house from which
came the sounds after a moments
search red lance found a small crack
in the wall as he peered in he
sharply caught his breath and drew his
knife but spurr clutched his hand
placing his eye to the crack in the
crumbling masonry the sergeant saw
that the rear end of the cellar had been
badly hit quite a large shell-hole
yawned blackly through it men
were continually passing in and out
their arms filled with dusty long-
necked bottles
   a small fire blazed on the centre of
the floor and about it capered a trio of
germans very drunk and uncertain
their heavy hob-nailed boots clattering
on the stone paving as they executed
some kind of fantastic farandole with
a dozen or more grinning blond-
haired giants clapping their hands in
accompaniment the firelight glinted
redly on their features as with hoarse
cries of pleasure they upended count-
less long bottles of pillaged wine and
flung the empty ones against the op-
posite wall with a crash
  along another wall were stacked
their rifles and ammunition belts laid
aside for the more complete enjoyment
of the carouse
  spurr studied the conditions with
grim pleasure but his angular green-
tinted chin shut like a locking safe as
he caught sight of three or four ter-
rified peasant women crouching in a far
dark corner they were sobbing fear-
fully as the fire flared higher and the
dance grew more wild
  signaling his companion to follow
spurr led the way around to the back
of the ruined house and crouched in the
bushes he could hear red lances
excited breathing as he peered at the
surrounding ruins there seemed to
be no life or movement save in the
cellar
   now fer it lance he breathed
and drew his revolver meanwhile
sheathing the bowie  i want you to

bonnet squarely on his head
   a wandering ray of firelight struck
the indians horribly painted face and
turned it into a demons mask as red
lance drew back his lips from the
whiteness of his teeth his muscles
bunched and with widespread arms he
launched himself down into the cellar
he landed at the edge of the fire caus-
ing a thick cloud of sparks to roar up-
ward
    e-e-e-yah-yah-h-h e-e-e-yah-yali-
ya-h-h-h his war whoop was ear-
piercing in quality and volume then
in the darkness outside spurr threw
back his head and cupping his hands
uttered a heart-stilling cry

argosy-allstory weekly
   yah-yah-e-e-e- spurr strained
his throat in giving the call which m
his younger years had caused the flesh
to creep on his back
   with flashing bowie poised aloft red
lance stood a moment in the full glare
of the fire revealed in full savage
splendor like autumn leaves in a
wind the long feathers of his red-tipped
war bonnet rose and fell amid the
swirling smoke before the astonished
eyes of that terrified assemblage
 the revelers stood paralyzed their
mouths gaping stupidly while wine
slobbered from their lips and trickled
down over their unbuttoned uniforms
the bronze giant seemed in their stim-
ulated imaginations to be the very in-
carnation of horror
  pandemonium broke loose and the
air was rent by wails of utter and
bestial fright like a haltered horse
shrieking when stalked bv a cougar
red lances gleaming blade fell
flashed up red-hued crashed down and
rose again while his shrill war whoop
railed like the triumphant paan of a

aimed fired aimed fired with a dead-
ly accuracy that toppled figure alter

scattered ashes
  a terrible cry arose die ameri-

   a stream of fugitives bolted for the
door spurr grappled with a fleeing
o-iant whose breath was rank with wine
with a quick twist the sergeant sent
him reeling sidewise with a jerky
stream of blood pouring from his side
  footsteps were racing about m the
dark while hoarse shouts sounded
from all quarters a shot rang out
from the darkness as a bullet whacked
against the stonework an inch above

to himself  that possell be mount-
in up prontoputting his fingers
in his mouth he blew a shrill
whistle which carried into the mael-
strom of sounds within listening
anxiously spurr could hear the pant-
ing cries of fighting men the pitiful
whimpering of the women as they
crouched along the wall all mingled
with curses and screams of the wound-
ed as red lances knife flickered to and
fro
  again spurr whistled and ducked
as a spurt of orange flame came from
behind the shadowy ruins
    keerist he swore  that skelp-
hungry injun  be the death o us
both
   just as he was deciding to carry on
the mission alone a dark shape glided
out of the cellar and clutched the ser-
geants arm
   three whispered the indian ex-
ultantly as he crouched beside spurr
   putting his mouth close to his com-
panions ear spurr gave instructions
and started off again with that peculiar
gliding step which is so soundless and
a moment later a clump of pine trees
hid them from the sight of the excited
and frightened enemies who pounded
noisily about firing at every fancied
moving shadow
   like the peal of triumphant bells the
word arnerikaner arnerikaner
resounded in spurrs ear truly they
had raised a storm a storm which must
surely engulf them ere they carried out
their mission in full spurr was too
old a soldier not to know that two men
cannot attack and aroiise an enemy
army corps with impunity no matter
how skillful the two may be in the art
of escape ten thousand against two
are long odds and bitterly the sergeant
thought of the perilous miles that sep-
arated them from their lines
  taking cover from tree to tree and
ruin to ruin they followed swiftly
along the course indicated by the ra-
dium-lighted arrow of spurrs com-
pass
    shore now lance i nigh left you
back there cautioned spurr  you
better jump plenty pronto when i
whistle
brothers in red

  corporal lances voice was strange-
ly thick as he replied  me get first
chance to take un warpath so easy
kill these hostiles no can stop
  threateningly the sergeant turned
on his companion  now listen son
im chief on this war party and ill
razee you fervent if you dont do as i
say our lives is too durned important
to-night to be frittered away for a friv-
olous lot o skelps his tone became
serious  onderstand now lance
weve got a dummed small chance o
coming through with our har as it is
dont make it worse
  red lance only grunted and a new
anxiety arose in spurrs mind as he
saw that blood lust inherent in the in-
dians nature was pushing sense and
obedience out of the red mans mind
  their progress toward touzai was
unimpeded save for a halt at the edge
of a road while long clattering col-
umns of artillery and munitions mov-
ing up for the next days advance
caused them to lie doggo in the weeds
of the roadside
  finally the last bumping caisson
with its nodding driver rumbled by
allowing the impatient americans to
dart over the rutted highway lying-
white and dusty in the fading moon-
light
  they had gone perhaps half a mile
when they commenced to encounter
numbers of infantry sleeping among
the tall trees of a little wooded area
there were hundreds and hundreds
of them spurr estimated with their
limbs sprawled in all directions snores
resounded from every side through
the edge of the forest he caught a
glimpse of touzai standing white
walled and apparently unharmed about
a quarter of a mile distant
  carefully recalling the map he had
seen unfolded on general kents knees
spurr meditated a moment
   look hyar lance he said
 well give these hostiles another lit-
tle scare then well bulge to the left
o touzee-them houses is still health-
    	a
ful and i allow theyre full o ger-
mans
  the osage drew his knife again
while a passing moonbeam revealed a
look of savage anticipation on his fea-
tures
   shall we use bombs this time 
queried the savage
  spurr nodded so that the three feath-
ers in his back hair seemed to stab the
stars
   yep we-all better wait till the
moon comes out agin-then heave them
bombs and screech he laid a horny
hand on the corporals shoulder  now
mind what i said dont get skelp loco
or well be took-an that means a per-
tickler introduction to a flock o mauser
rifles we cant get too gay this time
theys a sight too many o the enemy
about
   ugh replied red lance and
fished a couple of hand grenades from
his medicine bag meanwhile holding
his bowie in his mouth
  with a heart which had not beat so
wildly since the time he had been a
green recruit watching red clouds
warriors galloping forward sergeant
spurr wrenched the pin from his gre-
nade and held the lever tight with his
fingers
   you take that there covey over
yonder whispered he and leveled a
long forefinger at a clump of trees
where the ground was black with sleep-
ing forms
  just then the moon peered out of a
cloud and glinted on the helmets rifles
bayonets and faces of the sleeping
horde with a long heave spurr and
his companion sent their grenades
whistling among the men when the
missiles burst with a thunderous roar
spurting clouds of whistling fragments
high in the air the americans lifted
the war cry again and dashed among
the sleepers firing right and left
  everywhere resounded cries howls
and confusion under the drifting wall
of smoke
  men seemed to rise from between

argosy-allstory weekly
spurrs feet as he rushed on yelling
at the top of his lungs faces loomed
up from the ground and shots rattled
from all sides in the distance sentries
fired into the air giving the alarm and
rousing company after company
  die amerikaner indimer amer-
ikaner rose the cry for the second
time that night
  spurr had a glimpse of red lance
stooping and tugging at- a scalp then a
swirl of men shut him from view
frantically he whistled and bore off to
the left among the shadowy tree trunks
   lance he shouted as he dodged
behind a trunk  fer gods sake
hurry theyll git you in a minit
   e-e-yah yah came the distant
war whoop of the osage as he lingered
to strike down yet another foe
  in agony spurr whistled again con-
scious that he was being hemmed in
by angry bareheaded men with bayo-
neted rifles
   gosh darn it now thats torn it
fer fair swore the sergeant as he
slipped snakelike into the underbrush
a few yards he went then flattened
to the ground motionless while heavy-
footed infantry raged about one
mans heel missed the plainsmans hand
by inches yet he did not stir
  in the direction from which he had
come he could hear shouts of triumph
the banging of rifles mingled with the
shouts of red lance as he fought for
life slowly the tumult died though
he strained his ears spurr could catch
no sound of red lances voice a
few moments later while he lav mo-
tionless the sergeant caught sight of
what appeared to be a german n c o
holding the indians war bonnet
grouped around him was a mass of
infantrymen talking and gesticulating
wildly
   poor lance murmured spurr to
himself  he shore died game but he
worked his kyards too hard
  it was with a heavy heart that spurr
watched the enemy abandon their
search for him he was more than
ordinarily fond of red lance in whose
dauntless and uncurled spirit he found
a companion to his own something
glittered in the moonlight and fell to
a leaf beneath his face where it lay
glistening he passed a trembling
hand over his eyes
  arousing himself from his grief
spurr determined to go on to rubes-
court there he would make his last
bid for success in the capture of a high
ranking officer kent must know what
would happen in the morning
chapter vi
at german headquarters
it was nearly three oclock spurr
judged when at last the thoroughly
alarmed and infuriated enemy gave
up their clumsily persistent search for
him he realized he had gravely un-
derestimated their doggedness an-
other hour and a half would bring the
first streaks of gray in the eastern sky
-the daylight which would make es-
cape impossible
  finally the woods fell silent save
for the sleepy twittering of birds in
the boughs of the black-outlined trees
   now lets see john spurr he
said to himself as he rose to his feet
and peered about  i allow them
hostiles will bitscar plenty fer this hyar
hombre between touzee an our lines
accordinly ef i passes behind that
village and fiasears toward the home
corral considerable farther south i
stands a better bet o gettin thar
  he set off among the trees at a cau-
tious trot taking cover whenever an
untoward sound reached his ear ere
long he skirted the rear of touzai and
smiled as he caught sounds of move-
ment and noises in the apparently de-
serted village
  two or three times he had unwil-
lingly to swing out of his course in
order to avoid troops bivouacked by
the roadside but at length he reached
a territory which seemed practically
brothers in red

deserted troops had passed the day
before he quickly realized from the
cast-off dunnage which littered the
ground at intervals here was a pair
of worn-out boots there a blood-
soaked bandage sprawled on the
ground like a crippled white snake and
yonder a helmet with a ragged black
hole in its crown
  spurr broke into a gentle run as he
reached the unoccupied territory and
swung in a wide circle back toward his
own lines the warm night wind
rushed by his face and murmured in
the rustling trees overhead
  finally lie halted as he heard a sput-
tering motor cycle not very far away
   there must be a road over thar
he told himself
  shortly afterward the sounds of an
auto traveling at top speed confirmed
his conjectures
   i allow the roads behind that wood
yonder he remarked  now i won-
der where them sports is a goin in
such a all-fired jump
  a few minutes later found him
crouched beneath the sheltering foliage
of a beech tree on the edge of the
woods in the midst of a little clear-
ing stood a solitary stone farmhouse
he saw immediately that it was a place
of some importance an almost un-
broken stream of messengers on foot
horseback and motorcycle came up to
the gate of a low wall completely sur-
rounding the farmhouse whose sharp-
ly gabled roof faintly reflected the last
rays of the moon
   shore now murmured the ser-
geant  thats a headquarters of some
kind they shorely ought to be some
high rankin bucks in that wickieup
immediately he began to cast about
for a means of approach but as his
eyes roved in search of an entrance his
hopes fell at all four corners of the
wall stood sentries pacing to and fro
with fixed bayonets and judging from
their continual peering about evidentlv
verv much on the alert besides these
in the courtyard was a silently hurry-
ing stream of orderlies telegraphers
mechanicians and officers of all kinds
undoubtedly it housed at least a di-
visional commander and his staff a
mouse could not hope to enter that for-
bidding close-shuttered farmhouse un-
detected
  while he watched a car drove up
discharged a cloaked passenger at the
gate then wheeled out and backed in
with its rear to the wall which en-
circled the ancient farmhouse the
germ of an idea was born in spurrs
mind and as it gradually took shape
he set off for the roadside through the
woods
  he skirted the thoroughfare in the
underbrush until he found a place
which suited his purpose a series of
shell holes roughly filled with loose
stones broke the surface of the other-
wise smooth road with a triple row of
 thank-you-marms
  with a grunt of satisfaction spurr
settled down to wait it was hard
waiting too each minute that passed
in inaction brought him nearer to day-
light and discovery discovery had
but one meaning for sergeant john
spurr he shivered with more than
the cold
  at last a faint purring sound reached
the restless americans ears his mus-
cles tensed as the new leaves above his
head glinted in the first feeble rays cast
by a motor cars blue-lensed headlights
  suddenly it swung into sight a great
high-sided open touring car traveling
at a fast clip for a moment spurr
feared that the driver would not see
the shell holes and might speed by but
presently like music to his ears came
the squeal of brakes suddenly applied
  the car lurched heavily as it lost
momentum so that spurr who darted
out as the hood flashed by barely
caught hold of the folded top he
managed however to retain his grip
and deftly swung onto the rear crouch-
ing above the two spare tires
  reaching up he cautiously pulled
down the folds of a much-worn top

argosy-allstory weekly
so that it flapped over his head and
shoulders but no matter how much
he cramped and squeezed his feet and
ankles were exposed so he sighed and
resigned himself to his fate as the car
gathered speed again
  spurr knew very well that it was
only a short drive to the farm but it
seemed ceons that he perched on top of
the spares with the cold iron studs of
their surfaces digging into his bare
skin his heavily-weighted medicine
bag tugged at his fringed belt and
threatened to pull loose until he tucked
it between the spare tires
  at last he felt the body of the car
lean as it turned sharply to swing up
the roadway toward the farm and a
moment later he detected the sound of
voices challenging harshly while the
auto slowed down he strained to hear
the password above the roar of the en-
gine and thought he heard the word
 wilhelmstadt  but he could not be
sure
  again the brakes squealed as the auto
halted at the gate to the sound of rifles
being snapped to  present arms his
heart beat wildly what if the car
should go on and not halt at the farm 
the possibility had never occurred to
him he cursed the oversight then
again an inquisitive guard might
choose to peer under the top sagging
so sloppily behind
  several voices could be heard in mut-
tered conference till with a crunching
of gravel one of the cars occupants
got out slammed the door behind him
and went through the gates to the farm-
house spurrs heart missed a beat as
he waited for the car to be put into re-
verse and a sickening sense of defeat
overwhelmed him as he felt the car
glide forward instead it gathered
speed and went on perhaps twenty or
thirty feet then a voice shouted loudly
from behind
    nein nein it called in a penetrat-
ing bellow  gehen sic auruck zur
wand the auto halted
  vastly relieved spurr was just con-
gratulating himself on his luck when
another car in the act of leaving turned
on its lights so that they shone squarely
against the back of his machine never
before had his feet felt so large de-
ciding that the men at the gate could
not help seeing him spurr fumbled in
his medicine bag until his fingers closed
over the friendly grip of his revolver
   wal ef i takes the big jump ill
take five o them heinie sports along fer
company he breathed  so yell you
stud buzzards yell and see if you like
it
  nearer came the other car its lights
exposing spurrs moccasined feet with
a strong blue ray and at the same time
there came a sudden outcry sweat
broke out on the sergeants face and
chest while he waited for the first move
on the part of the men at the gate but
the chauffeur of his car only laughed
aloud and commenced to back in a mo-
ment he was out of the fatal radius of
light and backing up to the wall he
had looked at so longingly from the
edge of the woods
  like a black haven of refuge the an-
cient vine-grown bricks loomed near
until the outermost tire almost touched
the masonry then the driver choked
off his engine and got out to join other
waiting chauffeurs
  mingling as well as he could with the
long leaves and tendrils of the vine
nspurr slipped to the ground keeping
the row of automobiles between him
and the drivers after a cautious re-
connaissance he peered over the wall
which was slightly higher than his
shoulders
   hum he remarked to himself
 thars shorely a heap big pow-wow
goin- on in thar i seems to hear that
arnerikaner word passin around
mucho
  a quick glance to the right and left
showed him that the space between the
wall and the house was empty save for
farm carts and machinery all he would
have to do was to drop over and seek
a place of entry
brothers in red

  with a quick twist of his body ac-
complished while the arrival of a motor
cycle drew the attention of the helmeted
guards spurr vaulted over the wall
and landed noiselessly on the turf inside
the wall at once he ran round the cor-
ner away from the gate for men wrere
continually passing between it and the
house
  once inside he was not long in find-
ing a side door which appeared to lead
into avhat had once been a dairy shed
it seemed silent inside so with his
heart thumping wildly he lifted the
crude latch on the point of his bowie
knife and stepped in out of doors he
had felt wholly sure of himself but
here in the confined space of four walls
he felt a sudden sense of helplessness
and he glanced apprehensively over his
shoulder when a mouse hidden in a
heap of straw squeaked shrilly
  he halted irresolutely in the dark-
ness of the shed and sought by listen-
ing to the tramp of boots echoing and
reechoing through the house to visu-
alize a plan of the farm evidently
the various rooms served as offices lead-
ing from the main corridor upstairs
heavy footsteps made the boards above
his head creak eerily
   wal john spurr he breathed
 jore best bet is to drop on some of-
ficer in a hallway gag him and tie
his hands-mebbe you kin chuck a
bomb out front sos you kin sneak the
captive outn the back way but fust
me lad youve got to collect that high
rankin hombre
  he tiptoed forward and peered
through a keyhole he saw by the light
of a guttering candle that the next room
was tenanted by a great hulking private
who was enjoying a sound sleep his fat
cheeks rising and falling with his
breath resting beside him was his
bayoneted rifle spurr set his jaw and
returned his knife in favor of the re-
volver
  inch by inch he noiselessly swung
open the door until at last he was able
to slip inside his eyes riveted on the
sleepers face he watched the giant nar-
rowly then clubbing the revolver he
stepped across the red-tiled floor
  deliberately he measured the dis-
tance from the sleeper softly with
featherlike touch spurr plucked off the
germans little round cap then with
the full force of his sinewy arm he
brought the walnut stock down on the
sleepers bare head so that he grunted
softly and fell forward without a
sound moving like a menacing shad-
ow spurr lifted the german back onto
the rush bottom chair again setting the
cap back on his head then spurr tilt-
ed the body into the position in which
he had first seen it
   sweet dreams pcrrito murmured
the sergeant with a gaunt smile on his
painted lips
chapter vii
the captive
a doorway back of the uncon-
scious man was half open spurr
tiptoed cautiously through it and
along a dark flagged hallway toward
what must have been the dining room
  beyond a door at the farther end a
number of guttural voices were talking
loudly the speakers were evidently in a
heated dispute the nature of which the
sergeant could not of course under-
stand his eyes were glued on a wide
beam of yellow light where the door
was slightly ajar he went toward it
holding his breath with utmost cau-
tion he squinted through the narrow
aperture by getting very close to the
door he found to his satisfaction he
could see rather more than half of the
room
  a doubt as to the wisdom of linger-
ing in the hallway entered his mind
his position was perilous in the ex-
treme at any moment this door into
the council room might be opened wide
and there was no other doorway in the
hall into which he might dodge again
any one of the soldiers who swarmed

argosy-allstory weekly
about the farm might discover the un-
conscious man in the kitchen each
second was fraught with a real and
acute danger
  perhaps it was curiosity that held
spurr in the hallway but in any event
he drew a long breath cocked his colt
and returned to peer through the light-
ed crack
  at a table standing at one side sat
three men who if one were to judge
by their decorations and heavy gold
shoulder straps must be high ranking
bucks indeed at the far end of the
long paper-strewn table was set a lan-
tern its rays casting a yellow light on
the faces of the three
  spurr decided that the officer in the
center seat must be at least a general
like a forbidding fierce bird of prey
he sat with his pale eyes darting from
one to the other of his companions he
held himself bolt upright his thin body
rigid in its beribboned tight-fitting uni-
form his lean bloodless face flashed
in the lamplight as he bent forward to
consult the pile of documents before
him
  at a remark from the monocled of-
ficer on his right he pounded on the
table to emphasize a retort and sent the
papers which littered its surface drift-
ing to the floor to the listening amer-
ican each word seemed to be spat out
from beneath a close-trimmed blond
mustache
  farthest away on the generals right
was a gross thick-bodied man with a
full red mouth and a great double chin
a shiny roll of hairy fat neck bulged
above his high military collar and in
his right eye a monocle was almost bur-
ied in the folds holding it in place as
the fat man rolled his heavy head the
bit of glass twinkled in the lamplight
he sat comfortably sprawled in a gilt
louis xv armchair pillaged from
some chateau its slender legs seemed
ready to give way under the gluttons
great weight
  the third man was a frosty-eyed old
giant whose narrow mouth seemed to
be set in a permanent sneer like a
disdainful viking he listened silently
to the commanders tirade meantime
massaging the silvery beard which bris-
tled on his wolfish jaw
  spurr had selected the center man as
his prospective victim when there came
a sharp rapping at the door
  the three officers halted their quar-
rels and faced the entrance
   kommen sie herein bellowed the
fat man and thrust a frayed cigar stub
into his mouth
  the door creaked open to admit two
helmeted n c os with drawn pis-
tols they clumped in and halted before
the table where they saluted with me-
chanical correctness
  the straight-backed officer looked
up nodded then uttered a command
which caused the men in the doorway to
step back there was a slight commo-
tion in the hall beyond then the eaves-
dropping sergeant almost betrayed him-
self in a shout of surprise for through
the door was pushed a grotesque figure
he marched with a haughty air that
accorded strangely with his bound
hands and wild array it was red
lance
  his wig by some strange accident
was still in place but the rest of his
savage finery was sadly torn and
stained the yellow rays of the lamp
glistened on a trickle of blood flowing
unstanched from a long shallow wound
on his forehead the indian came to
a halt before the german officers and
stood looking silently it was a curi-
ous tableau the officers of an army
half as old as europe staring curiously
up at a bronzed paint-smeared savage
such as had haunted their childish mid-
night hours
  outside in the little hallway spurr
was jubilant that the indian was still
alive he rocked on his heels in the
darkness a wide grin on his face the
sound of a voice speaking in english
recalled his attention to the scene in
the adjoining room
   do you speak english  queried
brothers in red

the commander leaning far over the
table
   pray god lances got sense enough
to answer in injun thought spurr
  but the osage lifted his dark head
proudly and with the light reflected
in his glowing eyes he made reply
   yes
  say sir you swine thundered
the fat officer  you are speaking to
general von klagen
  deliberately red lance spat in the
fat mans face and reeled back as a
guard dealt him a savage blow on the
cheek with his revolver butt the
osage swayed dizzily but a contemptu-
ous smile twisted his lips as the fat
man heaved himself up his face a livid
mask of fury
   let him alone now hasling
snapped the general  time is very
short to find out what we must know
you can have him later he turned
again on red lance his white face set
in rigid lines
   now then you he measured
the prisoner half admiringly with his
eyes  this is a clever piece of coun-
ter-propaganda-you and your damned
friend have done great harm his lips
writhed back in a snarl  i intend to
make you pay for it
  a deep silence fell in the room so
that the squeak of haslings fragile
chair sounded loud when he resumed
his seat red lance only stared va-
cantly and fixedly before him as
though he saw a vision on the wall be-
hind his examiner
   we officers continued the gen-
eral  know what american troops
really look like real americans not
play-acting savages the general
broke off apparently meditating then
suddenly he rose to his feet and plac-
ing his hands on the table brought his
face within a foot of the indians
   how many americans are in the
mery sector
  scornfully red lance laughed
while the guards behind him stared in
amazement
   go and find out red lance no
tell
  speaking with a chill tone that made
spurrs fingers clench in apprehension
von klagen straightened up
    it would be well for you to answer
savage he suggested  we have
ways of making you answer
   bah grunted lance contemptu-
ously  osage squaw torture better
than any not even they make red
lance speak if red lance not choose
to
  it seemed to spurr that haslings
eves abruptly narrowed with an idea
he bent over to whisper in the gen-
erals ear while the gilt chair groaned
dismally
  for a moment they spoke in a hur-
ried whisper then the general turned
again to the prisoner
   now then you went on von kla-
gen  perhaps its money you want
or is it revenge- we can give you
all you want of either he paused
then resumed  why should you love
the americans they stole your land
ruined your people broke their prom-
ises again and again why should you
be loyal they have done you nothing
but ill but we we are different i
can make you rich beyond any in your
tribe i promise on my word what
do you say
  deeply anxious spurr studied the
indians face curious to see the effect
of this new line of attack he noted
with alarm that red lances expres-
sion had changed the red mans eyes
shifted
   you are right indians no love
american he grunted  maybe red
lance talk with you
  for a moment spurr refused to cred-
it his senses then a sense of nausea
seized his tired overwrought body
sick at heart he shut his eyes to the
scene of the osages treachery should
he open the door and hurl his bomb
before the faithless corporal had op-
portunity to give his damaging infor-
mation 

argosy-allstory weekly
  suddenly red lances whole con-
duct became clear to him as he remem-
bered how the indian lingered behind
at the ruined house almost inviting
capture frontier proverbs rising from
the past shook him as he recalled them
 trust a rattler afore a injun
 only good injun is dead injun
 truth and a injun is strangers
  resolved at last he reached into his
dangling medicine bag and drew out
a hand grenade deliberately his fore-
finger bent around the wire pin and
his arm muscles set themselves to
wrench it out when the sound of red
lances voice halted him
   what give
  with a restrained eagerness von
klagens precise tones came through
the worn pine boards before spurrs
eyes there was satisfaction in the
germans voice as he made an offer
   say ten thousand dollars 
   no replied the indian  red
lance not talk with hands tied
  with quick suspicion the old officer
broke in
   have a care excellency he
warned  i have read that these sav-
ages are very crafty it may be a
trick
  firmly red lance shook his head
 red lance no talk
  a moment von klagen wavered
then he signed to the guards to loosen
the indians hands
   he could not possibly escape
stated the general  there is no dan-
ger
  spurr the grenade ready in his hand
peered through the keyhole in time to
see one of the guards thrust his luger
into his broad leather belt and fumble
over the cords that bound red lances
wrist
   gol durn it all swore spurr bit-
terly  an i alius allowed that buck
wuz different since he were a naked
papoose i knowed him-allowed he
was like his ancestors whod ruther die
than break his word to a friend a
heavy sigh shook the sergeants frame
and he suddenly felt quite old and
tired
   now then went on the german
commander well give you fifty
thousand marks-about ten thousand
dollars in your money
  obstinately the osage blinked and
shook his head no enough was
all he said
  von klagen settled back in his chair
and crossed his meager legs before he
went on hasling and the other officers
peered up at the bronzed lithe figure
with more than interest
   well said the german  shall it
be fifty thousand dollars
  a slow smile parted the captives
swollen lips so that his long white teeth
glinted wolfishly
   it is enough
  again spurr almost wrenched out
the pin but an overpowering curiosity
to hear what the traitor would say-
stayed him wrhether the obliterating
bomb were hurled at once or a moment
later would make not a whit of differ-
ence not a man in the room beyond
would survive
  general von klagen passed a slender
well-kept hand over the scanty blond
bristles that covered his egg-shaped
head and reached for a pen and a sheet
of yellow paper
   good we understand each other
now we can go ahead with a quick
movement the prussian leaned for-
ward his face a mask of lowering sus-
picion  god help you if you lie to
its ill have you skinned alive my
word of honor on it
  the painted features of the indians
face betrayed no sign that he had heard
the threat he only stood looking
steadily at his gray-uniformed inquisi-
tors from his dark narrow eves
   how many americans are before
mery
  the prisoner seemed to ponder
while he slowly massaged his wrists
   about forty thousand he said at
length
  spurr suddenly replaced his grenade
brothers in red

in fie medicine bag he knew that
there were not a thousand let alone
forty thousand americans in the area
around mery plainly the osage was
lying whether to save his own skin or
to mislead the enemy utterly he could
not yet discover
  what von klagens voice rang
out in the low-ceilinged room like a
hand clap  forty thousand men 
two divisions von klagen did not
know that the american divisions were
averaging  men
  in silence red lance nodded so that
the long braids of his raven hair
swayed forward  his blood-sprinkled
breast hasling and the white-haired
officer stared open-mouthed their shad-
ows mimicking them on the plaster be-
hind
   yes forty thousand
  quite perturbed the german con-
sulted a field notebook on the table
spurr noted that his hand trembled as
he turned the leaves
   he lies bellowed hasling his
double chin crimsoning with wrath
 there are not forty thousand ver-
dammt amerikaner north of senlis
there are not that many available
  thoughtfully von klagen laid down
the field notebook
   you are wrong colonel he said
at length  there are indeed that
many in reserve but we-we thought
it impossible for them to be moved into
the lines in time with a weary ges-
ture he passed his thin white hand over
a face that had suddenly become
creased with a myriad wrinkles
 these americans accomplish the im-
possible-and they are many so
manv
  but the silver haired veteran on the
left laid his hand on the table and
coolly waited for the general to fin-
ish
   your pardon excellency said he
in firm measured tones  but i know
the savage lies
   yes half convinced von klagen
faced him
   yes we know there are only two
roads along which troops coming to
mery could advance he stated impres-
sively  those two roads are overrun
with retreating french we had posi-
tive information that the american
divisions he speaks of were no further
than compiegne at six last night it
is physically impossible for them to ar-
rive before this barbarian must have
left his lines four or five hours ago
nicht wahr no it is only a piece of
counter-propaganda the offensive
should be carried out as planned
  general von klagen wearily shook
his hairless head  ach you do not
yet understand the genius of these
americans he hesitated yet i
have never known you to be wrong
hassling so i will order the attack
as planned but mark my words -he
swung around in his chair to face the
veteran and spoke slowly- if we feel
an american counter attack early in
the day i will wait for the reenforce-
ments to come up our men are too
tired and now -he spoke in ger-
man to the sergeant guarding red
lance- we have learned what we
want take this savage out and shoot
him
  with these words which of course
spurr could not understand the prus-
sian deliberately turned his back on the
silent indian and picked up a field tel-
ephone the guards stepped forward
in a businesslike manner with the ropes
in their hands an action which left no
doubt in the sergeants mind
  acting with frontier speed he
snatched out his familiar old colt and
filled his lungs with his left hand he
flung open the door and with a wild
piercing  ee-e-yah-yah loomed in
the doorway a menacing figure
  frozen with surprise the germans
could only stare their eyes bulging and
their mouths open then with un-
canny swiftness spurr shot out the
lantern
   lance he shrieked  lance this
way fer gods sake

argosy-alistory weekly
  shots deafening in that confined
space roared like field pieces while the
blackness was streaked with spurts of
orange-red flame above the din the
air resounded with curses groans and
bellowed orders in an agony of sus-
pense spurr lingered on the threshold
until a naked body brushed past his
with that contact he fired another shot-
through the door wheeled and fled
wildly down the corridor toward the
dairy shed
  red lance was already peering out
a long-snouted luger automatic in his
hand
  it was a moment perilous in the ex-
treme as shrill cries rang out and run-
ning feet sounded in every direction
the walled farmhouse had become a
bedlam
   over the back wall gasped
spurr  theres a guard there plug
him first
  as spurr flung one leg over the top
a wild shadowy stream of gray-coated
figures came running along the space
between the house and the wall some
one fired at him and he felt a burning
pain in his right side as he dropped
over
  then things happened so quickly
that spurr had only disjointed impres-
sions of the sequence of events he
remembered having a glimpse of lance
exchanging shots with a sentry and saw
the soldiers dark bulk drop vaguely
he recollected firing back at a row of
heads which appeared at the top of the
wall
  with the speed of those whose life
rests with their flying feet he and red
lance raced for the shadowy haven of
encircling woods looming up against
the star-studded sky all about them
hissed whining bullets which missed by
scant fractions of inches twenty ten
five yards more then with bursting
lungs they plunged among the dew-
moistened leaves
   keep a-goin panted spurr as
they dashed on dodging among the tree
trunks  with what we knows we-
alls just gotta get back and theyll cor-
ral us ef we hides
chapter viii
thj comanche trick
onward they sped while the
woods behind echoed with the
crashing progress of their clumsy
pursuers who tripped and fell as they
plunged blindly on in the fancied direc-
tion of the fugitives
  once to their right came the sound
of pounding hoofs which raced ahead
and finally died in the distance spurr
decided it was a patrol quickly dis-
patched to cut them off evidently the
wood was a small one giving the ger-
mans hope of surrounding it ere the
americans could escape
  as the blur of foliage thinned before
their eyes spurr reached out and
pulled the osage to a halt
   hold on the roads jest ahead he
whispered  we caint outrun bosses
leastways i caint i aint so young as
i uster be we-alls in a hell of a fix
  eagerly red lance put his face near
spurrs  if can reach camp in time
johnny spurr we warn the general
make a raid even a little raid johnny
spurr hear what red lance told hostile
chief 
  a sudden sense of shame at having
doubted the indian made spurr flush
in the dark
   i shore did he said  but its
nigh onter seven mile to camp as i
jedge distance theys not half a
hour to four oclock an we-alls in hos-
tile territory an we got to get thar
how are we goin to make it
   ride suggested lance laconically
his savage profile clearly seen as he
glanced at the stars
  ecstatically the sergeant smote his
bare thigh now i allow you got
oncommon brains fer an injun well
work the old comanche trick but
hurrys the high sign-the aint a
minute but counts
brothers in red

  red lance nodded he retied the
bandage on his wrist and pulled the
knot tight with his teeth spurr
probed the wound in his side tentative-
ly it seemed to be bleeding steadily
but not strongly evidently the bullet
in passing through the outer edge of his
ribs had encountered a minor vein
   is johnny spurr hurt bad
   not enough to lose time about i
aims to get myself a hoss come along
now
  without snapping a twig they made
their way to the roadside and peered
along its course as far as they could see
then they turned off down a plainly
marked footpath for perhaps twenty
yards to a place where the branches of
a great oeech tree swung low over the
trail in a moment they were crouch-
ing above the path with the thick sweet-
smelling leaves hiding their outline
   in a wide circle about the wood the
ringing cries of their pursuers were
gradually closing in
   ef theres more than two in the
posse ill let the first ones go by
directed spurr  you take the next
to the last buck lance and ill razee
the tail-ender
   um grunted the osage
   pointing his revolver up in the air
spurr fired two shots in rapid succes-
sion then while the echoes were still
glancing from trunk to trunk he calmly
reloaded
  almost instantly from far down the
road came the steady drum of horses
feet advancing at top speed like the
tapping of a skillful drummers sticks
the flying hoofs sounded closer and
closer then on the road itself the
riders reined in with a flurry of sparks
and halted apparently undecided as to
what direction to follow
  breathing a prayer that the patrol
was not numerous spurr heaved a
stone which he had picked up for the
purpose into the underbrush along the
footpath silence followed during
which the jangle of accouterment rang
out loud then on all sides could be
heard the shouts of various patrols
moving in toward the spot where the
shots had sounded
  the cavalrymen broke into a gut-
tural shout and reined forward among
the trees with the starlight glinting on
their long sabers as they loomed into
sight the muscles of spurrs legs
braced themselves for a spring
   by straining his eyes he made out
the outlines of three horsemen who
were advancing at a slow trot peering
deliberately at the underbrush to either
side that an attack might materialize
from above was furthest from their
minds
     ist niemand hier grumbled the
leader hoarsely
   as the first rider bent his helmeted
head to pass beneath the bough spurr
drew his bowie and waited for red
lances spring a sudden dizziness
seized him which almost loosened his
hold he exerted his will power des-
perately with the realization that he
must have lost more blood than he
thought and with beads of cold per-
spiration breaking out on his forehead
he felt red lance brace himself when
the second rider was almost past the
limb the indian launched himself into
the air like a hungry cougar pouncing
on a doe and sprang to the horsemans
shoulders bearing him forward in the
saddle spurr had not time to watch
the struggle for the last cavalryman
had now halted beneath the tree inutter
astonishment like a swooping king-
fisher the sergeant dropped to the
broad back beneath him the bowie
gleaming brightly in his hand there
was a muffled scream as the horse
reared in surprise almost throwing
spurr from his back twice the ser-
geants right arm flashed down
 spurr caught the reins from the
germans nerveless fingers and steadied
the plunging animal until it stood stock-
still and trembling not until then did
he let the weight of the dead cavalry-
man slip to the ground with a faint
jangle of his equipment he glanced
	argosy-allstory weekly	v
ahead and saw that the leading ger-
man had evidently fled there was no
sign of him and lance was bending
over the second rider tugging at his
waist belt
  five minutes later two helmeted
uhlans complete with sabers and pis-
tols and wearing closely buttoned over-
coats turned out onto the road as a file
of panting infantry came crashing
down the trail from the direction of the
forest the riders settled themselves
low in the saddles and dug the spurs
into the ribs of their mounts which
snorted wildly and set off down the
road at a dead run
  with the wind rushing against his
face spurr felt some of the faintness
leaving and prayed that the warm
trickle which still meandered down his
side might cease how good it felt to
be in the saddle again after they
had ridden perhaps fifteen minutes red
lance drew in his horse until they
rode abreast
  happily spurr watched the white-
ness of the road unwind before them
and reveled in the strong stride of the
powerful brute between his thighs
every squeak of the leather every
rattle of flying pebble played a sym-
phony for him each foot they gained
meant a greater chance of success
they would win by god they would
win
   mebbe make it in time inquired
red lance  how far to go johnny
spurr 
   i allow we can ride about two-
three mile further he said  then
wed better dismount and walk heap
fast to get back on time
  red lance turned a face whose war
paint wias queerly incongruous with the
scuttle-shaped helmet bouncing un-
comfortably on his head at each stride
of his mount
  we have no time capture chief
  gone was spurrs premature glow
of triumph in the excitement of the
last half hour he had completely for-
gotten that phase of their assignment
  darn it all wal its too late
now come on
  he touched his powerful gray troop
horse with the spurs and again rode a
headlong gallop which sent the dimly-
seen landscape rushing past he felt
dewy leaves brush against his face
  onward they went over bare hills
and mist-covered valleys more than
once passing straggling groups of in-
fantry marching silently along the
roadside once they overtook a bat-
tery of seventy-sevens clanking along
from the head of the column an officer
hailed them sharply but spurr only
uttered an unintelligible shout as they
passed him with a clatter of hoofs
in a moment the clattering caissons
were left far behind
  five minutes later the riders caught
sight of a low ridge which spurr rec-
ognized as being immediately behind
the railway embankment at the same
moment they heard a car coming from
the opposite direction and caught the
glimmer of its subdued blue lights
  it rolled up to the two americans
riding by the roadside and ground to
a halt while an officer occupying the
back seat shouted an inquiry at them
in german that he and the chauffeur
were the only men in the car spurr saw
at once and with that realization he
determined to risk capturing the occu-
pant of the back seat surely it must
be an important officer who would be
riding about in such a high-powered
comfortably fitted touring car
  from the side of his mouth he whis-
pered the words cover driver to
lance who walked his horse forward
until he avas within a few feet of the
auto meanwhile spurr dismounted
and feigning to misunderstand shuf-
fled forward
   ivarum anhvorten sie mir niclit
growled the passenger leaning forward
to get a better look at the trooper who
did not salute his officer
  with a sudden movement the ser-
geant jerked his revolver forward
from the holster and thrust it under
brothers in red

the germans nose he started back
with a low cry of alarm just as lance
presented his pistol at the drivers
head wisely the occupants of the
car thrust their hands up towards the
sky which was commencing to lose
the true somberness of night
   out you grated spurr obedi-
ently the passenger got out he was
so short he reached only to spurrs
shoulder in spite of the uncertain
light the germans outline showed him
to be a fat ruddy little man with dark
sweeping mustaches and an imposing
waist line
  pressing his revolver point into the
germans stomach spurr wrenched
open the captives coat glanced at his
shoulder straps and heaved a sigh of
relief they were a welcome sight
enormous and twinkling richly with
silver and gold mingled with white and
crimson furthermore a double row
of ribbons stretched across the indig-
nant prisoners wildly heaving breast
   youll fill the bill said spurr
aloud  with them gobs of color you
shore must be a heap big medicine
man
  swiftly he ran his hand over the
captives body and located his pistol
this he confiscated and thrust it into
his own coat pocket  all right
lance he called  let the shuffer go
i aim for him to spread the nooze that
the generals been took itll throw an-
other scare into them thar hostiles
  leering savagely over the thorough-
ly frightened chauffeur red lance
signed to him to proceed spurring his
horse alongside with the luger lev-
eled the driver obeyed with comical
eagerness setting the car in gear with
a wrench that made the dirt fly from
beneath the tires
  a few hundred feet lance galloped
alongside until the machine gained
speed then as a gentle admonition sent
a bullet smacking through the wind-
shield the gray-coated chauffeur
ducked and almost drove off the road
in his terror
  wheeling his horse about on its
haunches the osage galloped back to
where spurr stood a soldierly figure
in his camouflaged helmet and long-
tailed cavalry overcoat unwaveringly
his colt menaced the prisoner who
stood with hands up-thrust and round
blue eyes popping withanxiety
    down thars the wheat field said
the sergeant and pointed off to the
right lance caught sight of an area
which seemed lighter than the rest of
the undulating terrain on which they
stood
    yes and there railroad added the
indian  how we get across this
time 
   a wide grin on his face spurr laid
a hand on the prisoners shoulder while
the german snarled under his breath
  hvars our annie oakley dye see
whats goin on down thar
   for an instant red lance stood his
head out-thrust as he studied the right
of way  um hostile bucks getting
up-
   crect corporal lance go the
haid o the class reckon wed better
dismount silently they swung to the
ground and freed their mounts giving
them a sharp slap which sent them
clattering back to the rear
   spurr dug the barrel of his revolver
into the prisoners back and signed him
to drop his hands  now be a good
mex heinie he advised sibilantly
 an youll keep company with your
hair be a bad greaser and that top-
knot of yournll wave in the breezes
frum the lodge pole o chief red
lances wickieup
  unable to understand a word of the
sergeants speech the prisoner never-
theless appeared to read the threat in
spurrs expression and trudged meek-
ly along through the morning mist
with his head dejectedly tilted on his
breast the skirts of his feldgrau over-
coat swishing against his bootlegs
  the dawn chill was in the air and
both americans welcomed the heavy
thickness of their captured uniforms

argosy-allstory weekly
which warded off the icy dewdrops
glistening on grass and leaves truly
the gods were good
  ten minutes walk brought them to
the foot of the long wooded slope they
had been descending and about fifty
yards away from a company of infan-
try who were sleepily slinging their
packs and answering a low-voiced roll
call distinctly the voice of the ger-
man sergeant carried to where the
americans and their prisoner watched
among the trees
   now when they all goes forward
directed spurr  well jest tag along
a few paces behind like we belongs to
em and mebbe we kin get into that
thar wheat agin
  once as a squad marched by their
hiding place the prisoner suddenly
filled his lungs but instantly spurr
pushed the muzzle into the germans
back instead of shouting the fat lit-
tle officer only emitted a gasping sigh
and turned sullenly away
  from the embankment rang a sud-
den shouted command which sent the
infantry scrambling up over the rails
with rifles tossed skyward as they
strove to keep their balance in the maze
of tangled wreckage
  gripping the germans wrist in his
left hand and with his right carrying
the revolver in plain sight spurr rose
to his feet and signaled to red lance
to follow after him
chapter ix
no maxs land
with regular steps the trio
emerged from the woods just
as the last of the infantry were
crawling over the embankment they
advanced boldly and were within a few
feet ofthe railway when red lance
hissed sharply to spurr to glance back
   his heart skipped a beat as he caught
sight of grav-uniformed figures ad-
vancing from their rear they came
on through the drifting white strata of
meadow mists like wraiths there
were hundreds and hundreds of them
their serried ranks stretched back to
the foggy limits of vision
  it seemed so unreal that spurr
thought it a mirage caused by his
weakened condition but every now
and then came the clank of a bayonet
scabbard against a metal gas-mask case
or the subdued curse of an infantryman
as he tripped in the uncertain light
  about them were machine gunners
staggering under their heavy maxims
and boxes of ammunition telephonists
lugging reels of wire bombers with
rows and rows of potato-masher gren-
ades slung to their belts and all the
different kinds of troops needed for a
sudden forward movement like a
gray-green tide the enemy forces
flowed forward carrying the trio with
them
  a spasmodic sense of panic almost
urged spurr into a disastrous head-
long flight as he realized the- were
hemmed in on all sides and that any
moment some sharp-eyed officer might
halt to inquire what two dismounted
cavalrymen were doing there bat he
conquered the impulse and dug his toes
into the side of the embankment as
he commenced to climb towing the
prisoner along on unwilling feet the
fat little mans eyes stared whitely out
from below the visor of his peaked
cap when spurr turned with a snarling
 come on
  far ahead a machine gun began to
chatter shattering the early morning
stillness with its spiteful drumming
rattle
  another took up the challenge then
across the plain to the right a field
gun roared dully obviously the days
slaughter was about to commence with
general von klagen moving forward
his division preparatory to the first
phase of a new offensive
  as spurr tumbled down the far side
of the right of way he was frantically
calculating the time left to them could
they arrive in time and give their all-
brothers in red

important information before the gray-
green hordes surged forward and
crumpled up the decimated french
spurr knew the american divisions
could not possibly be in position so
quickly only a bold demonstration
by the american handful on the ridge
could save a fatal and precipitate re-
treat which would leave the whole al-
lied flank exposed
  if they could only find general kent
in time spurr quickly saw that the
german staff realizing that their men
were convinced of the presence of
americans cinema creations though
they had painted them had given out
the information that these yelling sav-
ages were only scouts sent far ahead
of a main body which was still linger-
ing near paris
  let the brave sons of the father-
land charge boldly they urged and
rout the perfidious french before the
americans could come to their assist-
ance such was the nature of the in-
formation spurr felt now being given
out to the disheartened rank and file
  as he moved forward among the
tramping infantry which advanced
boldly over the waving wheat fields
spurr kept a sharp lookout for gaps
and strove to oblique into them when
any such appeared
  the eastern sky was now paling
rapidly so that the bearded features of
the men about them appeared in more
detail the troops in their vicinity were
a striking mixture of youth and old
age sad-eyed men of fifty and fifty-
five tramped stiffly along with droop-
ing shoulders beside pale-faced youths
whose cheeks scarce needed the atten-
tions of a razor these latter strove
to appear jaunty the effort was
pitiful
   they-alls powerful hard up for
men thought spurr to himself as he
led off toward a wood-covered knoll
which seemed to stand like an island
above the mass of moving men
  with a swishing of grain about his
feet red lance came up alongside
talking across the prisoner who
marched hopelessly between the tall
forms on either side lance spoke in
a low voice
   hostiles ahead begin take the
ground must be near front line he
murmured  in a minute johnny
spurr we safe but first watch un
chiefs to left
  looking ahead spurr saw they
would have to pass close by a group of
men evidently officers who stood
apart consulting maps
  there was nothing for it save to
march brazenly by and trust to luck
that they would pay no attention this
was scarcely possible as the eastern
horizon had already begun to take on
the faintest tinge of reel which glinted
faintly from the deep scuttle-shaped
helmets of the group who looked up
curiously at the approach of the three
they muttered among themselves as
spurr passed within a few yards of
where they stood
   smartly spurr whipped up his hand
in salute and was relieved to see that
the prisoner at his side had the sense
to follow his example red lance
who had dropped a pace or two behind
did likewise
   the sergeant was just congratulat-
ing himself that their temerity had
been rewarded when one of the officers
hailed them roughly his voice sound-
ed like a death knell to the anxious
americans
    kommen sic hier shouted the of-
ficer the prisoner turned half about
and opened his mouth but spurr
leveled the colt at his stomach and
broke into a run
  war ten bellowed the officer
meanwhile jerking an automatic from
the leather holster at his side others
of the group dropping their field glasses
and maps prepared to give chase
   spurr seeing a thick growth of yel-
low grain ahead rushed forward at
top speed while red lance seizing
the captives other wrist bounded on
 there was a sharp report from the

argosy-allstory weekly
rear and something whistled by spurrs
head the little mans short legs made
him a bad runner as the shots
hummed about he panted incoherent
prayers and cries of fear then just
as it seemed that one of the bullets
must inevitably strike him to earth
spurr caught the boom of a field gun
far up on the heights and realized that
the french batteries were firing their
early morning bursts with the wail
of a fire siren a shell screamed over
the trios heads and burst somewhere
in the wheat behind the firing from
the group of officers stopped abruptly
    jest the luck o seven devils
gasped spurr as they crawled forward
through the rustling wheat ears  in
another minute them bucks woulda
drilled us heap plenty
   in the half light a deep depression
loomed up ahead make for that
waller thar lance he directed  im
kinder tuckered out
   a moment later they paused on the
lip of a  shell crater and stared in
wide-eyed amazement a man was sit-
ting at the bottom clad in very little
but a grav overcoat he was pointing
a wabbling revolver in their direction
    stop vere you are stammered a
voice i dont vant i should have
to shoot you youre a nize fellers and
im a nize guy myself for vy should
ve fight
    the jew by god muttered spurr
 now i allow that beats the kyards
hey thar shakin bull put away tbat
pepper box or youll hurt yereself
oi velped the man in the gray
coat mein budclehs by jahveh
vere haff you been he spread his
palms wide and cocked his bullet head
to one side  should i fight dis  ar
all alone
   suspiciously red lance sank back
from the edge of the crater
    shakin bull got hostile m with
him whispered he  shoot um
both		
  spurr became more cautious and
looked again sure enough a long
figure sprawled limply behind the
hebrew
   whos that sport in thar with ye
oh that slafskys voice rolled
out importantly  thats my prisoner
you shoulda been here this schlimiel
comes up to me and says i should sur-
render

 because i want you should
    make me an offer i says and
this guy tries to give me the bums
rush but in a terrific hend-by-hend
bettle i geeve him the o k
  the prisoner stirred groaned and
stared dazedly at the ground
   wal yore the candy kid even jf
you did capture only a corporal said
spurr as he sank to the ground and
tried to keep the earth from spinning
about so violently  yore sport aint
got no epoolets nohow only that there
funnv braid on his collar too bad
you couldnt hev took a general like
us lance show shakin bull hyar our

  grinning widely red lance stepped
over to the fat prisoner and wrenched
back his coat so that his gorgeous
epaulettes twinkled dazzingly before
moe slafskys eyes he shrugged
carelessly  oh veil he sighed
 mine looks savager ennyvays
  and there was no denying the fact
that slafskys prisoner had an infinitely
more warlike cast about him as he
glared around the shell hole his fea-
tures were a picture of mingled hate
and disgust even spurr and lances
dejected little officer seemed to shrink
at the others baleful stare
chapter x
the end of the raid
twenty minutes later an amer-
ican outpost was astonished at the
sight of what appeared to be four
german soldiers accompanied by a
fiercely daubed indian brave advancing
brothers in red

up the gully they were watching the
indian in the group strode along his
hands weaving to and fro like a shuttle
   gee frank said the private who
first caught sight of the strange
group  dat von blink sure is potent
i-i-guess i got em again or else
i see an escaped member o buffalo
bills show wid four jerries
  his companion turned sleepily to
look then sat up with snort of sur-
prise
   wal may i be a long tall son-
he ejaculated and snatched up his rifle
its a trick of some kind rush it
to em steve he shut the breech of
his springfield with a snap and cud-
dled the stock to his sunburned cheek
  just then however one of the ger-
mans catching sight of the american
outpost stripped off his overcoat and
stood almost naked so that the weird
painting which decorated his powerful
limbs could be plainly seen
   hey no shoot he hailed and
urged forward one of his german com-
panions at the point of an automatic
  steves jaw dropped and he lowered
his rifle
  judas to jenny and seven hands
round now what in hell is this
   i aint takiir no chances grunted
the man called frank and fired
  like a falling log the shortest ger-
man threw up his hands and collapsed
while the tnaked men shouted implor-
ingly to the outpost to hold their fire
  throwing discretion to the winds
red lance chanced a bullet and came
sprinting forward until the riflemen
could glimpse his face
   hes a real injun- said steve in
amazement
  in another moment red lance was
in their midst raving with anger
 you gettum court martial he
growled  why you not hold fire
when red lance yell
  together the three hastily made their
way down the little ravine up which
spurr and his group had been advanc-
ing
    	a
  spurr was bending over the officer
he had captured and was endeavoring
to stanch the flow of blood from the
germans chest while slafsky shak-
ing with excitement covered his
savage-faced prisoner
  the wounded man obviously had not
long to live and spurr swore bitterly
as he saw his cherished captive dying
he lifted a face livid with disappoint-
ed fury and vented the accumulation of
thirty years frontier profanity on the
soldier who had fired the shot
   you darned buzzard-born skunk
he raved  pick that man up and get
him to general kent ef you want to
live after all weve been through
to have it all torn at the last minute
by a- he was about to explode
again into further flights of profanity
but he reeled and would have fallen
had not the soldier called steve caught
him
   get us to general kent pleaded
the sergeant when at last he was able
to speak  an for gods sake hurry
  on a little knoll stood general kent
surrounded by perhaps half a dozen of
ficers and runners his face as he
studied the rolling plain was strained
and haggard
  he turned to the officer who stood at
his side  its too late hardy he
murmured  there go the first ger-
man batteries laying down a barrage
theyll roll us up to-day
  a thunderous rumble from the dis-
tant range of hills set the birds over-
head twittering in alarm puffs of
gray smoke burst like corn popping
over a fire
  silently a gray-haired major nodded
 if only the rest of the division had
been able to come up the pity of it
is they could be here by this after-
noon-
  he broke off as a messenger panted
up the slope and saluted
  well
   sir sergeant spurr has returned
  disbelief lingered a moment then
kent caught his breath with a gasp

argosy-allstory weekly
   bring him here as quick as you can
move he snapped
  he rushed down the knoll with long
hasty strides in the direction from
which the messenger had come
  presently a familiar figure appeared
around a clump of trees it was lean-
ing heavily on a khaki-clad doughboy
quite forgetting all else the general
ran forward while spurr straightened
and saluted his face bore a ghastly
attempt at a smile
   for gods sake sir attack at
once he gasped and interrupted
by spells of weakness swiftly outlined
what he had learned in the corridor of
the walled farmhouse
  silently the general listened inter-
rupting with a laconic question now
and then when spurrs feeble voice
died away at last the general gave a
number of rapid orders to his staff
runners snatched hastily written or-
ders and went tearing off in all direc-
tions while telephonists squatting in a
clump of larches cranked their little
handles with desperate energy plead-
ing in urgent tones to speak with
 harry  john  and  mortimer
   well thats that hardy said the
general  wrell make a demonstra-
tion and pray god gentlemen it
works glancing up his weary
bleared eyes caught sight of a limp
gray figure borne on a stretcher by two
medical corps men he beckoned
them
   thars yore prisoner sir said
spurr  hes shore a high rankin
hombre all right but sir youd better
talk with him pronto hes like to peg
out any minute
  kents face changed and his eyes
sought spurrs  what you got a
prisoner too spurr nodded but a
red mist was almost erasing the scene
before his eyes doggedly he forced it
to dissipate but the effort left him
weak
   sergeant thats wonderful said
the general and strode over to the
stretcher red lance watched his face
expressionless  come on good-
man said kent  and work fast the
germans going fast and we need his
information badly
  the chubby face of the man on the
stretcher had assumed a greenish hue
and though he still breathed it was
evident that he would live but a few
minutes more
  while spurr sick with fatigue and
disappointment watched the inter-
preter bend over the stretcher an offi-
cer ran from a group in the background
and pointed to the dying mans epau-
lettes glittering splendidly in the first
rays of the sun
  whats that rapped the general
sharply what did you say
   thats no colonel repeated the of-
ficer who had interrupted  the poor
devils only a bandmaster
  at those fateful words the whole
scene wavered before the wounded ser-
geants eyes it seemed impossible to
have risked all that for nothing he
was about to sink willingly into the red
abyss which yawned so near when as
from a distance he heard another
voice
   mister general it said in ingra-
tiating tones  vouldnt a corporal do
vot a real nasty all-vool fierceness
hes got oi such a tough feller
   i havent much time to waste on a
corporal snapped kent  but search
him and bring him up
  spurr opened his eyes again as the
other prisoner was led forward the
german stood very straight with head
held high he saluted briskly his hard
mouth set in a straight grim line
  one of the guards thrust his auto-
matic into his belt and emptied the
prisoners pockets among other odds
and ends he drew forth a pair of lus-
trous glittering epaulettes he turned
and held them forth on the palm of his
hand while the officer who had recog-
nized the bandmasters rank stared open
mouthed and then turned to general
kent a perplexed look on his face
   theres some mistake sir those
brothers in red

are coloners epaulettes said he
 this man is the colonel-not the
other
  in cold incisive tones the german
spoke  i am colonel von pomer-
antz said he with a baleful glare at
slafsky who stood gazing his eyes al-
most popping out i protest this
is outrageous sir savages should not
be used in civilized warfare
  while the interpreter undertook the
prisoners examination at the direction
of the intelligence officer general
kent strode over to where the osage
tenderly bent above spurrs white face
   only loss of blood sir said the
medical officer who had examined
spurrs wound  hell be all right
soon
  seizing the opportunity slafsky
sidled up before the general and sa-
luted
   well
   mister general please he begged
 couldnt i put on my pents yet
  a half smile showed on that officers
lips as he nodded and hurried off
trailed by the members of his staff
then there came a ragged burst of
artillery fire behind them while over-
the
head screeched the first shell of the
pitiful barrage the exhausted french
batteries were attempting presently
the firing stopped and from the bottom
of the heights came a deejhthroated
american cheer
  hours later general kent hollow-
eyedand tired out but with a smile of
satisfaction on his face repassed the
grove in which he had left the trio
they found red lance squatted beside
spurrs comfortably contrived couch of
blankets and hay a few feet away
sat slafsky chastely clad in a cast-off
pair of blue breeches which rose almost
to his naked armpits
  general kent halted while lance and
slafsky rose to salute
   needless to say men youll be re-
warded he said your work has
been of tremendous value not three
men in a hundred thousand could have
carried out the difficult almost impos-
sible assignment you undertook i
congratulate you
   oh thats all right mister gen-
eral said moe slafsky with superb
modesty  dont mention it-that
aindt noddinks any time you vants
anythink done just call on us injuns

dance hall mining
pkawson city in  was one of the richest towns of its size in the
world wages were very high and every one carried a poke of gold dust
money in any form was scarce and dust was the current medium of exchange
out for a good time hilarious miners with full pokes carelessly meas-
ured the precious metal and spent it in the gambling saloons and dance halls
    dawson city in  is a quiet conservative town the dance halls are
gone wages are normal and hilarious miners no longer do the double shuffle
in the flora dora
     gold is still plentiful but it is now found in the banks placed there by the
corporations that own the enormous dredges working on the creeks it is
also found under the floors of the abandoned saloons and dance halls
    several of the old-timers have bought in the pleasure resorts of 
and are making an excellent living rocking out the gold from the dirt under

the crime circus
 with every pressure being exerted lo drive him from the bar gillian hazel-
 line faced the crisis of his brilliant career-and a most exciting case
by george f worts
chapter i
an ultimatum
gillian hazeltine consid-
ered the girl with immeasurable
	approval she stood with one el-
bow on the mantel above the fireplace
in which logs smartly crackled and dis-
solved in flame and smoke her cheek
pillowed on a forearm her eyes closed
or dreaming into the fire pier tousled
curly brown hair came to a downy
point on her nape it was a lovely
neck surmounting beautiful slim shoul-
ders
 it is better dorothy said the
great criminal lawyer  that ninety-
nine guilty men should escape than that
one innocent man should be punished
dorothy murphy junior member of
the firm of madeline sceurs said noth-
ing gillian hazeltine continued in si-
lence to approve of her
  the cheek visible to vhim was bright
with health she wore a boys heavy-
blue sweater khaki shirt laced mocca-
sins she was slender but her slender-
ness was that of a gracious maturity
dorothy murphy was however on the
sunny side of thirty perhaps ten years
yawned between them
  as she turned from the fireplace gil-
lian hazeltine knew that her answer
was going to be no not a wavering
tone-qualified no giving him grounds
on which to base an appeal but a no
of distinctness and finality
  his years of practice in the criminal
courts had taught him that trick of
knowing a mans mind before the man

instantly the darkness behind its glaring light was knifed by a stuttering
stripe of red fire
the crime circus

knew it himself women were more
difficult they were smooth liars
cleverer at the game of meaning one
thing and saying another of thinking
one thing and saying just the opposite
  the girls clear brown eyes consid-
ered him
   xo she said distinctly-with fi-
nality and he knew that she wasnt
thinking the opposite or teasing him
or merely being coquettish
  he blurted  its because im al-
most forty if i were ten years young-
er-
   dont be silly she stopped him
   a mans age he overrode her op-
position  has nothing to do with his
years
   dont tell me gillian that a man
is only as old as he feels
   i wont he said sharply  a man
is as old as his energy i have more
energy than any man of twenty-four
you can name i do more work re-
quire less sleep actually by any kind
of yardstick you want to use im fif-
teen years younger than the average
man of thirty-eight
  the girls eyes again began to twin-
kle humorously
   when im fifty i wont be older
than the average man of thirty-five he
asserted
   if you had a shred of conscience
gillian youd be seventy what made
you decide youd rather marry me than
marguerite
   i love you said the famous law-
yer
  dorothy murphy laughed softly
   i dont believe you know the mean-
ing of the word youre a cold calcu-
lating machine gillian-thats all you
are were both attractive girls its
taken you a year to decide which one
of us will be more of an ornament did
you flip a coin gillian
   i thought you liked me gillian
said with the petulance of a boy of
twenty
   darling i do like you the girl
laughed  im really tremendously
fond of you youre clever youre
amusing i admire this marvelous en-
ergy that youre so proud of but
youre not my type as the modern girl
says the old-fashioned girl would
draw herself up haughtily and tell you
she wouldnt have you if you were the
last man on earth
   why he persisted  am i not
your type
   because the girl answered
 youre a rascal you were probably
quite as much a rascal at twenty-four
as you are at thirty-eight the trouble
is i suppose-if we must analyze these
things- am hopelessly romantic i
must be able to idealize the man i love
well there arent any ideals in you
iyou are grasping greedy calculating
a trickster in short you havent any
principles you coldly figure out what
you want then you turn on this energy
of yours-and get it
   a year or so ago or sometime after
your second wife died you began get-
ting lonely you began looking around
for some nice pretty girl to share your
nice house and your nice cars and your
-yes your nice millions with your
choice seemed to narrow down to mar-
guerite and me somehow you have
eliminated marguerite you must have
been awfully sure of me
   i wasnt at all the lawyer denied
 i only wanted you more than i ever
wanted anything in my life there
wasnt any calculation about it i do
love you damn it i do i need you
i lealize that im not by any means per-
fect a girl with fine ideals with lofty
purposes-a girl like yourself doro-
thy-would be a guiding star for me
the defense rests dorothy
laughed
   youre cruel said the man
   i know you so well the girl told
him  everything you say is so clev-
erly calculated gillian youre so used
to twisting facts to suit your ends
youre so used to swaying people by
your logic-but i see clear through you
gillian youre too persuasive you of-

argosy-allstory weekly
fer to share your worldly all with
me and when i dont give in to that
temptation you attack every womans
weakness-by saying that you need me
that i am your shining ideal
   its true -lie proclaimed  you
are
   rot said the girl  you havent
a soul you havent in the sentimental
sense a heart youre cold scheming
ruthless youre where you are my
dear because of what you are arent
most of us youre the greatest crim-
inal lawyer in the state-perhaps the
greatest in america-because you have
absolutely no soul
   time after time youve defended
murderers with the blood of the kill
fairly reeking on their hands youve
got them off youve made fools of
stupid district attorneys youve made
fools of whole juries youve bought
juries youve bought judges and
when you havent bought them youve
taken the greatest pride in your ability
to sway them with your words-in
making them believe black was white
youve made yourself the shining hope
of the underworld why do people
call you the silver fox because you
have a christian soul and noble ideals
   people who arent clever condemn
cleverness the silver fox grimly an-
swered  i do nothing worse than
other lawyers i only do it quicker
  gillian hazeltine was fighting as he
had perhaps never fought in any court-
room if he had deliberately gone
about winning dorothy murphy it was
only because he wanted her so much
he loved her for her courage her fine
ideals indeed he loved her for the very
qualities which made her despise him
what he lacked she had she was he
had known for a long time a comple-
ment to his own brilliant personality
she wasnt brilliant she was sound
square fine
   you might have become a corpora-
tion lawyer she pointed out
   corporation law is no cleaner than
criminal law he retorted
   it seems cleaner
   but it isnt perhaps criminals ap-
peal to me because they are under
dogs
   murderers- she murmured
   look here said gillian  a man
who commits a murder is usually justi-
fied i mean there is some good rea-
son behind it i dont try to make juries
believe a murderer is innocent of the
crime i try to make them place them-
selves in the murderers position goad-
ed as he was
  you do breathed dorothy mur-
phy with large round eyes of surprise
  i do
   you do you mean when the evi-
dence is against them ive seen you
get murderers off scot-free on tricky
testimony
  gillian hazeltine sighed
   you make me feel guilty as the
devil
   angel you are guilty as the devil
she laughed
-  you know there is no justice in
american criminal courts he urgently
went on  a beautiful woman kills
her husband with a hammer because
she hates him-and the jury frees her
a homely man kills his wife because he
hates her-and hangs is that jus-
tice 
  the girl made a little face at him
   are you really furious gillian or
is it merely your court room manner i
mean have you an honest emotion in
your system
   court rooms the lawyer declared
 are arenas lawyers are gladiators
the cleverest gladiator wins the
merits of the case have very little to
do with the verdict that situation
existed when i was admitted to the
bar
   did you try to reform it
   it took me a year or two to lose
my illusions a court room is no place
for an idealist so i became a realist
i adapted myself to the conditions i
found i made up my mind to win
cases by every means at my disposal
the crime circus

   buying judges bribing juries
using words as a smoke screen to hide
the real issues the beautiful girl
stabbed at him  youve summed up
precisely the reasons why  cant love
you gillian youve chosen to walk
with red-handed murderers  he that
toucheth pitch shall be defiled there-
with or however it goes you shouldnt
have tossed your ideals overboard you
should have fought for them
   i should have starved
   you are where you are because of
what you are the girl repeated  the
spokesman of the underworld the de-
fender of the crooks the gunmen the
gamblers the bootleggers-the little
friend of the great moral unwashed
why dont you tell me you will go your
way and sin no more
  gillian hazeltine lounging on the
arm of a chair with a cigar clamped in
his teeth looked at her dazedly this
slip of a girl had turned aside the
shafts of his energetic intellect as
masonry would turn aside darts of
straw a dozen women he knew
would have jumped to possess him at
a snap of his blunt fingers this girl
not only did not desire him or his
position or his wealth she defied and
ridiculed him
  he seldom lost his temper when
a show of temper was called for he
could give an excellent imitation of that
emotion without losing a shade of his
superb mental calm she had surprised
him baffled him so completely that he
was now honestly mad clear through
  her eyes after her challenge re-
mained innocently round and pro-
vocative
   i want you to go straight gil-
lian she added in a mockingly grim
voice
   please stop being flippant he
snapped
  dorothy murphy gravely attended
him eyes narrowed lips apart but no
longer smiling
   im close enough to being in love
with you she said quickly  that if
you stopped your criminal practice and
went in for something i could admire
or respect id be tempted to reconsider
you
   give up my criminal practice en-
tirely
   and instantly decide between me
and murderers now and promise
never to jilt me for a fascinating
murderess
   youre asking me to throw over-
board the biggest practice in five
states
   i am i sell it im confident i can
make you so happy you wont miss the
murderers
  you are
   i am gillian
  gillian hazeltine looked at her
wildly as he came up from the arm of
the chair he had desired many other
women but he had never desired a
woman to the point of such madness
throw away his practice-the fruits of
fifteen years of energetic toil
  it momentarily occurred to gillian
that he must be getting old men
made fools of themselves over pretty
women when they were no longer on
the young side old fools was he
at that age or did the fighter in him
merely demand her surrender on any
terms 
  he tried in a space of seconds to
reason himself out of the dangerous
mood give up his lifes work in ex-
change for her slim soft perfection
admit he had been a knave to banish
that derision from her eyes he dis-
covered that he wanted her at any
sacrifice
  ill do it dorothv he suddenly
exclaimed
  with all the clumsy ardor of love at
twenty he caught her in his arms
pressed kiss after kiss upon her soft
moist responsive mouth thrilled to the
clinging delight of her heard himself
saying foolish romantic things
   well pack up and go abroad
darling well cruise the mediter-
ranean  well go to the south seas

and eat breadfruit under palm trees
you adorable
  she was starry-eyed radiant with
exultation in this proof of her power
over him
  marguerite murphy tall stately
statuesque blond girl in a negligee of
black trimmed with white lace came
down the stairs eying them with won-
der and amusement
   gillian she observed in a liquid
golden voice  i adore this camp of
yours roughing it de luxe is loads of
fun the swimming has been wonder-
ful your jap cook is perfect i am
grateful for the hours of leisure you
two have given me-i really did want
to catch up on my reading i have
enjoyed the pines and the hemlocks
but thank heaven - thank heaven
gillian we can now pack up and go
back to town
  one lovely white hand trailed along
the banister as she descended talk-
ing
   i was beginning to think you two
never would stop snarling gillian i
dont know whether to congratulate
you or condone with you i dont
think dorothy appreciates you she
will probably make you the worst wife
the world has ever known she is
extravagant lazy and fickle
  gillian laughed boisterously as mar-
guerite senior member of the firm of
madeline sceurs moved swiftly across
the room-her grace that of a tigress
-and enfolded her sister in her arms
it had been in truth a most difficult
choice to make even now he won-
dered marguerite in a black evening
gown with her white shoulders her
glorious golden hair her pink delicate
lips was superb-elegant
  darling dorothy was excitedly
saying  hes promised to give up
his criminal practice hes tried his
last case no more-ever
  aihazed blue eyes questioned gillian
he nodded affirmation
   she wouldnt consider me on any
other terms
   anywoman announced the beau-
tiful golden-haired girl  is biting off
a large chunk when she bullies a man
into giving up his lifework
   he wont regret it dorothy con-
fidently stated
   but-so suddenly
   he promised dorothy added
   but gillian how can you get
away with it
  i will
   you cant let people down
   it isnt necessary i havent a case
on hand of any importance
   can you really pull all your chest-
nuts out of the fire
   let them burn he cried reck-
lessly
  marguerite murphy gravely shook
her sleek golden head
   i dont think you know what youre
saying i think youre drunk with
love
  if he cant i wont have him
dorothy declared  thats the bar-
gain-murderers or me-now or
never
   all i can hear said her sister
soberly  is a monkey wrench falling
into a lot of delicate machinery of
course i havent your high ideals
dorothy i am a ruthless woman
poor gillian i hope she finds a halo
that fits you
  dorothy with her arm around gil-
lians broad muscular back looked into
his face and said sweetly  you wont
be sorry
  a heavy-fisted clamor at the door
forestalled gillians answer the room
suddenly still seemed to throb with the
pommeling a mans muffled excited
voice cried
   mr hazeltine mr hazeltine
lemme in its click
  frowning gillian strode to the door
and unbolted it
  a man came plunging into the room
with head down a white-faced man
with a flattened nose and wild black
eyes
  he burst out
the crime circus

   dey bumped off big ben lewis
dey pinched the dearing girl
chapter ii
gang vengeance
as gillian hazeltine quickly closed
t the door the two girls looking
with startled eyes from the in-
truder to him saw that his face had
suddenly gone white that small pearls
of sweat had promptly gathered on his
judicial brow
  the famous criminal lawyer mopped
his forehead with a large blue-bordered
handkerchief and said
   pull yourself together click just

gillian gave the two sisters a weary
gray smile
   ladies may i present mr click
gorner-one of our most picturesque
underworld characters he is known
as click because of an old habit of his
of saying  do you click wit me if
you dont click with click he generally
wears a gun under his left armpit to
help you make up your mind what
time was lewis killed click

  the gunman shot a hostile glance at
the beautiful sisters put his mouth
close to gillians ear and whispered 
   theres a lot of people who want
the dearing dame railroaded fer this
but she didnt shoot him i know
who did the shootin i saw it so

said
  dorothy murphy broke in   gillian
youre not going with this man
   i must find out what he knows
honey this is much more serious
than it appears on the surface big
ben lewis was in a way the king of
the underworld-a tremendous power
politically im not exaggerating when
i say that his death will be felt in every
corner of this state run along
click while i get a hat and coat
  he opened the door for the gunman
and click gorner scuttled out into the
night gillian hastened to a small
closet under the stairs secured a felt
hat and a fall coat and started for the
door
  dorothy impulsively ran to him as
if to detain him by force but he
brushed past her to the doorway where
he paused
  he saw the lights of an approaching
car swing around the last curve from
the village of dexter at the end of the
lake the lights now flooded the road
and the narrow lawn which ran down

argosy-allstory weekly
from the porch to the lake sharply
etching the lean figure of click gorner
against the blackness of a pine thicket
  a more powerful beam flashed on
it played full and brilliantly upon the
gunman following him as a spotlight
follows an actor on a darkened stage
he was running now as if the light
had frightened him
  the car came plunging on and gil-
lian held his breath tingling with a
sense of fatality with a retching of
brakes the car came to an abrupt halt
  instantly the darkness behind its
glaring lights was knifed by a stutter-
ing stripe of red fire this stabbing-
intermittent blade of red flame was ac-
companied by a ripping crash of sound
  click gorner was tossed and spun
about in the white drench of radiance
as if by violent destructive hands
   it was the first time gillian had been
a witness to the swift and horrible ef-
fectiveness of a modern hand machine
gun and the shock of it suddenly sick-
ened him in his own way he was a
fearless fighter but the sight of death
always filled him with a childlike terror
  the savage snarl of the machine gun
ceased as abruptly as it had begun-
and click gorner lay limp and torn
and broken on the roadside
  a hand in the room behind gillian
flashed off the lights as a woman
screamed once the lawyer was ener-
getically pulled back from that perilous
threshold he was turned about and
firmly clasped in a womans slender
strong arms
  which woman
  dazed and shaken by the brutal as-
sassination of click gorner he could
only for the moment clasp the woman
to save himself from toppling over
  the quickness with which it had
happened   
  dorothy or marguerite
  as his eyes accustomed themselves
to the dimness of the room-the red
dimness of dying embers-he vaguely
saw the form of a woman lying athwart
the hearth
  one of them he reasoned had
screamed and fainted the other had
leaped to the wall switch and pulled
him from the doorway this one was
now in his arms
   dorothy or her sister
   a glaring white beam flickered along
the rafters as the death car backed
turned and sped off with a roaring
gust from its exhaust
   out there in the darkness tinder the
trees crumpled bullet-ridden lifeless
lay click gorner
   the woman in his arms released her-
self the lights in the room flashed
on
  he croaked  dorothy even in
his shocked state he could be aston-
ished that in this acid test of charac-
ter the younger sister had proved
braver and more resourceful
  she was white with excitement and
fear but her eyes were dark tender
with concern for him
   i thought they might be planning
to get you too gillian
   he said  marguerite has fainted
   she always does dorothy mur-
mured ill get her a drinkyoud
better have one too youre as pale as
a ghost
    it was a terrific shock ill phone
the sheriff at dexter he said
   the phone bell began ringing before
he had crossed the room hazeltine
picked up the receiver and shakilv said
hello

known mans voice rasped
    it is said the lawyer
   did you know that ben lewis has
been killed and that violet dearing has
been collared

voice returned  im just calling to

tine keep your hands off this ease

   never you mind who it is im
telling you to keep your hands off this
case-or youre going to get yours
the crime circus

  gillian snarled  whos going to
give it to me
  the unknown man answered  try
and find out
  he hung up gillian angrily jiggled
the hook and presently secured the at-
tention of central he instructed her
to trace the call
 ill hold the phone he added
the report came in a few seconds
that the call had originated in burkes

boro

a deep bass voice presently an-
swered its owner confessed himself
to be tim burke the pool rooms pro-
prietor gillian knew him well be-
lieved him to be trustworthy

been mr hazeltine he said in an-
swer to the lawyers questions  weve

  tim burke requested him to hold the
line he returned to the phone pres-
ently and said
   rafferty was in here all evening
but no one seems tove geen him in the
past half hour mr hazeltine is
anything wrong 
   if you see rafferty tell him to get
in touch with me any time after mid-
night ill be at my house thats all
tim good-by
  gillian hung up and turned from the
phone to find dorothy murphy seated
beside him she asked bluntly
   who is going to give you what 
 some one he gravely answered
 doesnt want me to mix into this
case
   neither does some one else said
the girl you dont intend to do
you 
   not if it can be avoided gillian
assured her
    it must be avoided gillian i sup-
posed that sooner or later this issue
would have to be met-a murder in-
volving a combination of circumstances
that you would find simply irresistible
but i didnt expect to see it happen so
soon
   honey it hasnt happened
   then you arent going to monkey
with this case
  he hesitated before answering her
 it isnt an ordinary murder case its
the result of a political upheaval that
will set the state by the ears there
isnt a politician in the state who wont
turn white when he hears that ben
lewis was killed-by the dearinsr
girl
   who is this dearing girl 
gillians gravity increased  no one
quite knows she was a nice girl who
recently decided by all accounts that
the primrose path is the easiest
   was she ben lewiss mistress
   no clear-nor anybody elses she
is greentons leading lady bootlegger
she turned to that because she didnt
seem to be able to hold any respectable
job shes been making a great deal of
money and blowing it in on ben lew-
iss roulette wheel she is a beautiful
thing and i dont believe she killed ben
lewis i mean putting together the
things that i know-that i cant dis-
cuss with you just now
   youre saying in so many words
gillian that youre interested in her
case-youre tempted to defend her
and i am telling you-in so many
words gillian-that if you defend this
girl- dorothy stopped as the tele-
phone bell sharply began to ring
  a number of voices crowded in on
the circuit when he said  hello
quiet was succeeded by a crisp mas-
culine voice saying
   mr hazeltine  this is governor
brundages secretary the governor
wants to talk with you
  very well gillian acquiesced
  the deep rough voice of governor
brundage came booming down the
wire

argosy-allstory weekly
   gillian
   yes governor
   have vou heard that ben lewis is
dead
   i heard about it a short time ago
 have you heard anv of the de-
tails
   only that violet bearing has been
arrested
   i understand that two eyewitnesses
saw the shooting they have evidently
a strong case against the girl
  gillian said nothing the governor
after a wait inquired impatiently
are you still there gillian
   yes governor im here
   it woudld be advisable i think if
you came up here and had a conference
with me as soon as you can make it
gillian if you are asked to handle
this case i would consider it a favor
if you deferred decision until you had
seen me
 i will drive to the capital to-mor-
row or next day was gillians answer
 thank you gillian good-by
gillian was frowning as he replaced
the receiver dorothy exclaimed
   that was governor brundage
  gillian nodded
   he doesnt want you to touch the
case
  gillian looked at her curiously
  why not she demanded
   i dont know he answered  im
going to find out thats two people
so far who dont want me to touch
the case its getting more and more
interesting
   if you let yourself be drawn into
it- dorothy began warningly
  he reached forward and patted her
hand it was a slender white beauti-
ful hand he had fallen in love with
dorothys hands long before he had
fallen in love with dorothy
   darling i wont be drawn into it
stop worrying i love you i dont
intend to lose you
   she cried   all this to-night proves
just what i was saying a dreadful
murder occurs in the underworld-and
you are the first person every one
turns to
  he smiled  the friend of the un-
der dog dorothy
  she did not return the smile  the
friend of gunmen and murderers
   the murderer hasnt so far called
me up he reminded her
   how can she shes in jail
gillian had nothing to say to that
he lifted the receiver again and re-
quested the dexter operator to connect
him with sheriff bolton when the
gruff familiar voice of his old friend
came on the wire gillian said
   pete theres been a killing out at
my camp here a gang of greenton
gunmen drove out in a car and polished
off click gorner
  how long agod this happen
sheriff bolton demanded
   id say twenty minutes
   whered the car go
   they seemed to be heading back
toward greenton
   that means theyve gone through
dexter the sheriff exploded  why
didnt you phone me in time to head
em off
   because i didnt want you and
our posse massacred gillian an-
swered  the gang in that car is
armed with at least one machine gun
they are probably full of hop and
and would mow their way through hell
and high water big ben lewis was
shot-killed-in his office at nine
thirty click gorner is no doubt the
first of a number of victims
  there was a long silence at the sher-
iff end of the wire he presently
said phew as if he were suddenly
uncomfortably warm
    ill be right out with the coroner
he added weakty  well hold the in-
quest immediately the coroner will
bring along enough men for the jury
we can count on you cant we gil
 not on a coroners jury gillian
said hastily i hate dead men i
wont look at a dead man youll con-
duct your inquest on the lawn where
the crime circus

the body is lying youre not going
to bring it into this house
   all right gil all right who
killed ben lewis
   theyve arrested a girl named
violet dearing
   never heard of her well well
be right out gil
  they arrived-a carload of men in-
cluding sheriff bolton and the coroner
-in about half an hour the inquest
was held at the roadside with gillian
standing on his front porch refusing
to participate
  the coroners jury after counting
thirty-two bullet holes in click gor-
ners body graa-ely decided that the
gunman had met his death in a violent
manner
  cause of death penetration of
sundry vital organs including heart
lungs liver kidneys stomach and in-
testines by bullets fired with delibera-
tion and premeditation assailant or
assailants unknown
  the mortal remains of click gorner
were lifted into the tonneau of the
sheriffs car and driven away
  the telephone rang once more as
gillian his japanese servant and the
murphy sisters were making hasty
preparations for departure
  at the end of the line was an old
friend-or an old enemy-of gillians
his opponent in countless court room
battles-adelbert yistle the prosecut-
ing attorney of greenboro he ex-
citedly wanted to know if gillian had
heard of the death of big ben lewis
 i have said gillian
   then you know that violet dear-
ing has been arrested charged with
killing him
	i do
   are you going to handle her case
 i havent decided she hasnt
asked me
   well she will she is referring
all questions to you already im
simply warning you gillian not to
take that girls case its a prima facie
case of first degree murder and you
can simplify matters for everybody by
keeping out of it if you have any
sense of justice you will youve cost
the state hundreds of thousands of
dollars in the past couple of years for
trials because of your damned tricky
methods be a sport keep out of this
case and-well give me a chance to
win one
   the only promise i can give was
gillians answer  is that i havent de-
cided to take this case
   you wont have a leg to stand on
if you do take it mr yistle argued
 two witnesses saw her fire the shot
the gun with two cartridges dis-
charged was found concealed on her
 i could find two hundred who
didnt see her fire the shot said the
jocular gillian
   the newspapers mr yistle per-
sisted  will be unanimously against
you everybody is sore at the way
youve been wasting the taxpayers
money on these court room farces
give me your word that you wont
take this case will you
   who told you to call me up and
ask me not to take this case gillian
demanded
   why-why- the prosecuting at-
torney stammered  nobody i-im
asking you of my own volition
   good-by said gillian rudely
  the silver fox replacing the re-
ceiver on its hook was grave he had
as a matter of fact not the slightest
intention of defending the dearing
girl or of having any hand in the trial
yet the temptation to leap into the fray
was strong the request and threat
he had received had fanned his interest
to a blazing curiosity being a fighter
born he loved opposition
  when the girls came downstairs an-
nouncing that they were packed and
and ready to start for the cify he
sternly surveyed them
   did either of you by any chance
hear what click gorner whispered to
me just before he went out the door
and was killed

argosy-allstory weekly
  the sisters shook their heads hadnt
heard a word of that whispering
   what did he say  dorothy want-
ed to know
   that the dearing girl did not kill
ben lewis
   who did
   click didnt tell me some gang
as i see it had orders to kill him so
that he could not tell
  dorothy asked anxiously  you
havent decided to take that case
  he shook his head he did not
know what to do a personal respon-
sibility had been against his will
thrust upon him to clear an innocent
girl accused of murder if he defend-
ed violet dearing he would automati-
cally lose dorothy murphy if he did
notdefend violet dearing she would
in all probability go to the electric chair
railroaded by a sinister power
whose influence lie had felt twice to-
night
  he decided before making up his
mind on the course to be pursued to
interview nicky anderson who could
tell him what click gorner had vainly
tried to tell him
chapter hi
the frame-up
gillian said good night to the
murphy sisters at their apart-
ment doorway and drove on to
his house in the fashionable riverdale
section lie had built it during his
brief romance with the second mrs
hazeltine a mansion of fifteen rooms
one of the showplaces of greenboro
  its lonesomeness as he let himself
in oppressed him the rooms struck
him suddenly as huge over formal un-
friendly he pictured dorothy murphy
being here to greet him it was a de-
lightful picture her presence would
fill this echoing solitude with bright-
ness and warmth
  the lonely lawyer  wandered up-
stairs to his office which had been an
invention of the second mrs hazel-
tine-now a permanent expatriate on
the riviera he seated himself at the
telephone and with a strong effort of
will pulled his thoughts together
  presently he lifted the receiver and
called a number a woman with a
high whining voice answered gillian
said very softly
   this is mr hazeltine gillian
hazeltine i wonder if the mechanic
who works on my cars is there
there avas a silence he hoped that
she would understand and that any one
who chanced to be listening in would
be deceived she whined  ill see
gillian waited a full five minutes
then the womans voice again
   he dont want to come to the
phone he aint feeling good
   did you tell him mr hazeltine
was calling
   i told him
   tell him again tell him its very
important
  f all right but he aint feeling
good
  after another five minutes wait
his patience was rewarded a mans
voice with a nasal twang came into
his ear it was so similar in intonation
to the voice of click gorner that the
two could hardly have been told apart
nicky anderson said
   what do you want
   im having ignition trouble on my
lincoln roadster gillian said almost
in a pur  i wonder i f you could come
right out
   not a chance im sick
   the way you came last time would
be shorter-and better gillian softly
urged him he was referring to a
path through the woods back of his
estate nicky could come through
those woods and enter the door unseen
by any one watching the front or sides
of the house
   this night air is bad for me said
the man who according to the dead
click gorner was theonly remaining
witness to the murder
the crime circus

    indoor air is just as bad gillian
pointed out as significantly
    ive got a bad headache protested
nicky anderson
    but youll come up said gillian
    ill think it over said nicky
  the lawyer hung up the receiver and
crossed the room to the large window
facing south it commanded a view of
the immaculate lawn sloping off toward
maple avenue even at night the
hazeltine grounds were fairly well il-
luminated because of the profusion of
street lights in the riverdale section
  he saw a man lounging under a
young elm tree the man seemed to be
looking up at the window perhaps it
was his imagination but gillian was
certain he saw something glitter in the
mans hand
  gillian pulled down the shade and
rang for his butler when toro ap-
peared the lawyer said
   i am expecting a man who will
come to the back door and walk in
without ringing or knocking you are
to wait in the kitchen and bring him
directly to my office go through the
house now and see that all windows are
fastened all doors locked all shades
pulled down
  toro acknowledged these instruc-
tions and departed the telephone bell
began to ring it would be gillian
foresaw a busy night for him
  the agitated voice of a man came
into his ear
    is this gillian hazeltine 
    it is
   this is wally brundage mr
hazeltine the man said and added
 thank god ive found you can i
see you at once
   you can said gillian wondering
why the son of the governor should
want to see him
   you know dont you that big ben
lewis is dead
   yes i know
   and that violet dearing has been
arrested charged with murdering
him
    i heard that too yes
    ill be right out mr hazeltine
good-by
   gillian heard a-door close as he hung
up the receiver then soft footsteps
on the back stairs toro said in his
precise english
    the gentleman walked in the back
door sir
  behind the japanese towered the
lanky figure of nicky anderson he
was unshaved his blue-gray eyes
had that brilliant gloss which comes
from cocaine his long horselike face
was pale and oily from much perspir-
ing his fingers at his side were
twitching
    well he said  i got here
    sit down nicky gillian curtly
instructed him
  nicky glanced shrewdly about the
room
   no chance of this house bein
broken into is there he anxiousfy
wanted to know
    all windows and doors are locked
gillian assured him
  nicky sat down on the edge of a
chair nervously lighted a cigarette and
asked huskily
  wheres click
   gillian looked at him thoughtfully
   click is dead he drove out to
my summer place immediately after
ben lewis was bumped off a gang-
followed him in a car
   nicky turned a shade paler
    what did click tell yuh
 he told me you and he had seen the
murder he insisted that the dearing
girl didnt shoot lewis who did
nicky anderson shook his head
   mr hazeltine he said with
husky-voiced gravity  i dont know
the dearing dame didnt do it click
and me was standin outside the door o
that room lewis uses as his office we
was waitin to go in an brace him fer
a loan see we was waitin in that
dark sort of alcove in the hall when we
seen the dearing dame come up the
stairs to go into his office
c
argosy-allstory weekly
   the minute she put her hand on
the doorknob we heard two shots in-
side i mean she had her hand on the
knob when the first shot was fired and
she had the door maybe a foot open
when the second shot was fired
   we rushed into the room after her
and there was big ben sprawlin over
his desk top with blood cornin out o
two holes in his forehead
   wait a minute the lawyer stopped
him  theres another door into that
office isnt there
   yes mr hazeltine theres a back
door that leads into a hall goin to a
flight of stairs to the street that nobody
but ben lewis himself ever used
   was the door closed when you
went in
   yes sir it was closed but not
locked click and me took one look
and breezed
   you were afraid of being
pinched 
  sure we was why not aint
both of us got records as long as your
arm you ouglita know mr hazel-
tine
   go on with your story
   there aint much more to tell mr
hazeltine we beat it down them
stairs to the street and a black sedan
was just pullin away from the curb
   a sedan 
   yes sir i think it was an old
twin-six packard we didnt get the
license number and we couldnt make
out who was inside there wasnt
anybody else in sight-i mean on the
street  click says you ought to know
about it right away i mean we hung
around while the wagon drove up and
they took the dearing dame down to
thestir and click says he was gonna
drive right out to your summer camp
and tell yuh what we seen
   in other words gillian took him
up  there were no other witnesses to
the fact that the dearing girl did not
kill lewis but you and click
   shes a nice kid nicky added
 i think its a frame cold as hell
   who would frame her
   i aint in on that who bumped off
click the rafferty gang hes in
with the mayor aint he i havent
even got a good guess who do you
think would frame the kid 
   i dont know said gillian
   and what a hell of a witness id
make to testify for the dearing kid
nicky muttered  theyd laugh me
out of court with my record
   your record spoils jou as a wit-
ness gillian agreed  no jry -in
the world would believe you after a
prosecuting attorney finished asking
you about your past but you are
nevertheless valuable nicky i know
youre telling me the truth and who-
ever defends the dearing girl will know
that she is innocent
   what do you want me to do mr
hazeltine i oughta be hittin the grit
if the rafferty gang got click theyre
gonna get me next they knew we was
like brothers
   ive been thinking of that said
gillian he glanced at his watch  its
one fifteen nicky the chicago lim-
ited stops at greenboro junction to
change engines in about forty minutes
get aboard at the junction and go to
chicago go to the weymouth hotel
and take a room under the name of-
let me see-jerry conway stay in
that room lav off booze and dope
   ill read the gideon bible nicky
humorously suggested
   it wouldnt do you a bit of harm
lay low wait for instructions from
me something may develop if i
wire ill use code if i send ou a wire
saying  buy cotton youll know that
i	have no further use for you and you
can fade the other wire will be  sell
cotton that will mean several things
it will mean that you are to round up
a gang come back to greenboro con-
ceal yourselves and get in touch with
me
  who you after-rafferty the
gunman grimly asked
  the silver fox said nothing
                  ba
the crime circus

     itll cost you a pile of jack nicky
hastened to add  theres nothin in
the woild i wouldnt do fer yuh mr
hazeltine after what you done fer me
-but a chicago gang will cost jack
yuh want about seven good men be-
sides me dont yuh thatll set yuh
back about five grand countin railroad
expenses and hop those guys dont
work without hop do you wanna let
me have the five grand now in case the
deal goes through
   gillian smiled
    ill wire money if its necessary it
may not be necessary i hope it wont
be necessary at present a hundred
will keep vou going heres a hun-
dred
  he gave nicky anderson five twen-
ty-dollar bills
   have you got the code straight in
your head
  nicky grimfy nodded  buy cot-
ton means yuh dont need me sell
cotton means round up a gang bring
em here and report to you
    good luck said gillian
   he didnt trust nick- anderson he
trusted no crook although time after
time he had saved some rogue from
prison by impressing upon a sentiment-
al jury the need of  giving this poor
misunderstood kid a chance to go
straight the reformation and the
gratitude of crooks he had found were
popular fairy tales but he was sure
nicky would follow his instructions
not from gratitude but because of cer-
tain specific things that gillian knew
about him because he knew that gil-
lian was ruthless with double crossers
  the silver fox tiptoed to the south
window and peeked out through a crack
between shade and sash the man un-
der thj elm tree had gone elsewhere
  gillian waited listening he would
have been pained but not surprised to
hear at any moment a snarling staccato
of shots meaning that nicky ander-
son had been violently sent to join his
pal click but there were no shots
the night continued peaceful
   	a
  under the gentle light of a rising
moon riverdale slept greenboro slept
happily unaware of ugly sinister forces
at work at its very civic core
  a lean gray roadster whispered into
the hazeltine crushed bluestone drive-
way like a monster lizard with incan-
descent eyes under the porte-cochere
it stopped the glaring eyes winked
out and in the bowels of the house a
bell rang loudly and musically
  toro was presently ushering up into
gillians study a pale agitated young
man
  wally brundage slung a crumpled
hat and a light overcoat into a chair and
effusively shook gillians hand he
was of the athletic type tall broad-
shouldered and graceful with thick
curling golden-blond hair live spar-
kling blue eyes strong excellent teeth
he might bethe captain of a football
team or one of the new generation of
gentlemanly pugilists
  gillian knew him casually he knew
him only slightly better by reputation
an unruly young man given to larks
headstrong and a little wild but decent
   its a damned outrage to come
barging in on you like this mr hazel-
tine he gushed as he squeezed and
pumped gillians hand
   people come to me at all hours
when theyre in trouble gillian said
cordially
   god knows im in trouble mr
hazeltine
   sit down and collect yourself wal-
-y weve got the whole night
   but theyre giving vi the third de-
gree 
   they wont harm her shes a
smart girl
   youll take her case wont you
the boy cried
   wally i dont think i can
  governor brundages son leaped up
and clutched his head he was obvi-
ously in a state of tremendous tension
   youve simply got to mr hazel-
tine  theres not another lawyer in
this town-in this state-in the world

argosy-allstory weekly
-who knows the political situation as
you do it isnt a straight murder case
i tell you its politics
  he stopped he glared panting at
gillian he brought his big brown fist
down with a smash on gillians desk
   my father has told you not to he
fairly shouted
   there isnt a man in this state who
can keep me away from a case if i
want to take it gillian corrected him
 you may think my reason is foolish
but look here wally youre in love
arent you
   i am i certainly am
   well so am i and the girl i want
wont have me unless i drop criminal
practice-beginning now if i take
miss dearings case i lose the woman
i want
   if you dont take her case theyll
railroad her through to the chair
   youre asking me to make too big
a sacrifice ill get good counsel for
you ill stay behind the scenes ill
give them all the information all the
dope-
   it wont work the young man
stopped him  theres only one way
to clear vi thats for you to go into
court and do it mr hazeltine he
went on in a lower tone  you dont
know whats been going on let me tell
you just a little i met vi a little over
a year ago when i wras first out of
college it may sound like kid stuff to
you-but it was a case of love at first
sight we simply fell for each other
like a ton of bricks
   my father was mad enough about
it to kill me you know where he start-
ed in life-at the end of a pick on a
railroad gang hes always been sensi-
tive about his lowly beginning and hes
wanted to make a dog-goned lounge-
lizard out of me he wanted me to
marry way up in society in fact he
picked the girl you know her beulah
hemmingway rich homely and
dumb
  gillian nodded he had heard this
part of the story
   when i told him i was crazy about
vi he threw a fit and tried to knock me
down when he saw that that stuff
wouldnt work he got busy on vi her-
self at first he tried five different
times to frame her compromise her
some way but she outsmarted him
each time then he brought pressure
to bear on her job if youll remem-
ber she was assistant librarian at the
main public library at the time she
lost that job and got one as a stenogra-
pher in the whitley construction com-
pany dad got her fired out of there
   in his time he has used mighty
rough methods in smashing men who
stood in his way but i dont think he
ever used meaner methods than hes
used on that poor kid he didnt realize
how much spunk she has
   too much spunk said gillian
  wally brundage stared at him
   too much spunk gillian repeated
  he that fights and runs away may
live to fight another day as some old
poet said she should have run away
shes only made a bad name for her-
self by staying
   vi is red-headed and half irish
the young man said sadly  she
wouldnt run away from a charging-
grizzly
   can you explain her conduct since
the last job our father forced her out
of gillian asked
   her conduct
   shes a bootlegger isnt she wal-
ly it seems to me your father has
proved his point at least hes made
a bootlegger out of her
   im not so sure he forced her into
bootlegging wally brundage de-
murred  ill swear theres some mys-
tery connected with that i know her
principal reason for going into boot-
legging wasnt the money although she
did need money but she only grins
at me when i ask what she is up to
shes ten thousand times smarter than
i am i know shes square and de-
cent-
   even if she has gone down the scale
the crime circus

from assistant librarian to bootleg-
ger
   ill fight any man who insinuates
she isnt square ancl decent
    youll have plenty of fights on your
hands in the next few days gillian as-
sured him  what was she doing in
big bens to-night
we were playing roulette
   you too eh
  the athlete nodded
  why i mean has she honestly
fallen for roulette 
   she seems to enjoy it the young
man grunted  shes been playing
there night after night always for small
stakes and neither winning nor losing
he added belligerently after all
nice people play roulette at deauville
and monte carlo and biarritz dont
they 
   nice people dont play roulette in
big bens gillian answered  unless
they do it under the guise of slum-
ming well what happened wally
the young man stiffened  we were
playing when that pale fellow malone
i think his name is-bens man friday
-came and whispered in vis ear she
told me shed be back in a minute and
hustled out of the room id never seen
her so excited
   scared
   no excited pale and eyes snap-
ping you know well she almost ran
out of the room and next thing i knew
everybody was yelling that ben had
been shot-twice you ought to ve
seen the rats beat it out of that dive
 you stuck
    certainly i stuck
   then the police came hazeltine
prompted
   yes
   how long did it take the police to
get there
   i dont know i was too excited
it may have been five minutes-or for-
ty about all i remember is seeing the
place suddenly swarming with cops and
a big red-faced man i never saw before
in my life kept hollering  the girl shot
ben she killed ben i knocked him
down i hit him as hard as i could
in the mouth
   he saw her shoot ben 
    he said he did
   did you find out his name
   its ezra wallace hes a dirty
liar he never saw her shoot ben she
didnt shoot ben
  who did
   i dont know nobody knows vi
doesnt know-and she was first in
bens office after the shooting she
says the smoke was still in the air-i
mean the smell of it but there wasnt
a soul in the office
   who arrested her 
   police captain sorrenson his
men herded us down into two patrol
wagons to the police station when
they let me go i tried to get you by
phone i kept trying till i got you
   did you talk to miss dearing
  i did in the wagon sorrenson
tried to push me in the other wagon
but i elbowed him out of the way and
climbed in beside vi
   was she scared 
    at first she wasnt so much scared
as dazed then as she really realized
what was happening she became furi-
ous about all she would say was that
they had put banana peels under her at
last and she told me to get in touch
with you immediately
   gillian looked distressed
    wallv you will have to believe that
i am being absolutely honest with you
i hate to let this girl of yours down
i would like to take her case every-
thing i have heard about miss dearing
makes me interested in her but in
justice to myself i cannot take her

to her ill give her all the advice i
can all the help i can-but i will not

  wally brundage had seized his coat
and hat from the chair where he had
slung them now he poked a stiff brown
forefinger at gillian as if it were a

   he said in a thick choked voice
   im pretty dumb i never did
amount to much im not very good
at reading between the lines but
theres one thing i know as surely as
god made little apples this whole
thing is a frame-up putting this mur-
der on vi caps the climax its a cold-

back of it and youre in it too
    well go down to the jail and talk
 to your fiancee gillian responded
 angrily  what you said in the be-

red hair
however faulty wally brun-
dages mental processes may
have been no criticism could be
made of his taste in women specifi-
cally  violet dearing was not only
beautiful but she had brains
   gillian hazeltine made this discov-
 ery before he had talked to her through
 the bars of her door for three minutes
 he was pleasantly shocked and stimu-
 lated she was petite under her
 gleaming cap of bright red hair were
 large eyes of purest dark blue she had
 flawless white skin and beautiful hands
   the silver fox gazing into her cell
 had greeted her
    redheads are born trouble mak-
ers
  she had cried you are gillian
hazeltine i cant tell you how glad
i am to see you did wally get in
touch with you
   he did you may be less glad
when ive finished telling you in per-
fect confidence why i cant possibly
handle your case
   her expression did not darken with
 despair as had so many faces when
 gillian refused to lend his assistance
 she said directly
    its not because you think im
guilty
    i know gillian answered  that
 you arent guilty
    how do you know  she asked
    a witness told me you didnt do
 the killing
     did he see the actual killing
    he did not all he saw was that
 you did not do it
   the blue eyes glowed
    that means the case against me is
 spiked she exclaimed
    unfortunately miss dearing it
 does not
    but if a witness-
    the witness it happens is not
 credible he has a criminal record as
 long as your arm
   even now he saw no despair in her
 face he wondered if she was the
 type of innocent who foolishly places
 unlimited trust in justice if she were
 he had overestimated her intelligence
 she expelled his doubts with her next
 words
     they wont electrocute me violet
 dearing confidently declared  i know
 too much
   about whom gillian promptly
 asked
   she gave him a wise little smile
  ill tell that to the lawyer who de-
 fends me im as innocent as a new-
 born lamb moreover i was terribly
 fond of big ben lewis he was a
 great rascal a really great rascal with
 a heart of gold from what i have
 heard of you you and big ben must
 have been very similar
    gillians face was a poker face
     we were old friends he admitted
     i know it she told him  thats
 one of the reasons why i wanted you
 to take my case then there would
 be in addition to my innocence a re-
 venge motive i am surprised that you
 would not go into the court room to
 avenge the death of an old friend i
 am even more surprised that my case
 doesnt appeal to you
  it appeals to me gillian cor-
 rected her  but-
  listen interrupted the beautiful
the crime circus

 redhead  i told wally to tell you in
 case you hemmed and hawed that this
 whole proposition is political the mur-
 der of big ben is only an incident a
 big incident but nothing to compare
 with the things that a smart lawyer like
 you can bring out in a properly con-
 ducted trial why do you suppose it
 took iivo patrol wagons less than five
 minutes to reach big bens from the
 seventh precinct station after he was
 found dead
    i smelled a rat there too gillian
 agreed
    i could show you loads and loads
 of smellier rats now will you tell
 me what moral objection you have to
 handling my case has governor
 brundage scared you off i thought
 you were too big to be afraid of that
 rat
    i am gillian smiled
  too big or too afraid
    big he laughed
   then why wont you take my
case
   gillian told her simply and briefly
 he dwelled upon his love for dorothy
 murphy and of the condition that dor-
 othy had imposed upon her acceptance
 of him upon his conclusion violet
 dearing sighed
    ill say she said without bias or
 meanness that that girl is nothing but
 a darned fool she is toying with dyna-
 mite you love her so i wont say any-
 thing more im sorry you wont take
 my case because in the past couple of
 hours ive been looking forward to it
 with the greatest enthusiasm ive
 been hearing about you for years ive
 wanted to meet you  thought this
 would be a wonderful chance to see
 your brilliant brain in action i wanted
 to see it in action with mine the two
 of us i thought could put on a show
 that would make this state stand up on
 the seats
   she considered him half smiling
   i mean a show mr hazeltine
since ive been sitting here with all
sorts of ideas using my brain as a
 race track ive worked out a beautiful
 scheme for a-a crime circus
   a crime circus
    you see she eagerly went on
murder trials in this country have be-
come  more and more spectacular
havent they t a good snappy murder
trial is harder to get into nowadays
than a kings coronation great squads
of reporters come and report the do-
ings the whole country is on its tip-
toes for silly willy to take the stand
or for spineless judd to tell his story
why not do it properly 
   gillian was smiling indulgently
 what would you suggest he
 asked
    i would suggest that the state hire
 say the lincoln stadium it seats sixty
 thousand people have microphones
 over the judge the witness stand and
 the lawyers connected to loud speakers
 sprinkled all over the stadium so every
 one of the sixty thousand could hear
 clearly and let the lawyer for the
 defense and the states attorney collab-
 orate on publicity
    disgraceful gillian murmured
but she knew that he wasnt serious
    for a popular murder trial you
need certain elements first of all the
accused should be young and beautiful
well am i or am i not qualified
    y ou are touchingly young and dis-
 tractingly beautiful  gillian assured
 her
    second went on the eager red-
head  the crime should have occurred
in a sinister setting well didnt it
    a gambling den is sufficiently sin-
 ister gillian agreed
    third it must have an element of
 real mystery who killed ben lewis
 did i if not who did a man who
 shot and ran  a woman who fired
 and fled r the smell of burned smoke-
 less powder was in the air when i
 rushed in and saw ben lying face
 down isnt that sufficiently mysteri-
 ous
    it seems to me was gillians com-
 ment  that you are strangely light-

argosy-allstory weekly
hearted for a girl accused of murder
and about to suffer the degradation of
a murder trial the notoriety of the
scandal sheets the battering-ram of a
powerful political machine and the ac-
tual possibility of electrocution
  violet dearing looked up soberly in-
to his face
   im not a coward mr hazeltine
the past few months have taught me to
mask my emotions at least-thanks to
the honored governor of this state
for the first hour in this cell i was
frantic with terror i dont deny it i
thought those bullying detectives would
give me the third degree ive heard
theyll tear a womans clothes off and
insult her horribly if she doesnt con-
fess to everything they want her to
confess to
   i think they intended to give me
the third degree but changed their
minds when i told them you were my
legal counsel of course i was scared
then i took counsel with myself i
didnt tell myself that heaven will pro-
tect the poor working girl-im not
suffr a sap as that i merely told my-
self that gillian hazeltine would soon
come to my rescue-a saint george
armed to slay the fire-spouting dragon
my persecutors
  she paused  ill admit now that
your refusal to play saint george is go-
ing to give me a sleepless night oh
why she wailed  did you have to
fall in love with a girl who disapproves
of criminal court practice
  gillian did not answer violet dear-
ing gazed up at him then shook her
head as if baffled
   you love a good fight i love a
good fight what a fight we could
have put up together
   what a fight gillian murmured
   and what a show
  he chuckled
   you might advise me what to do
miss dearing suggested
   ill have to think over the problem
of legal counsel gillian said  i cant
help them or wrork with them-but ill
gladly answer all questions
   youre a peach said the red-
headed prisoner  and if i go to the

the valley of ivory
phe legend of the  valley of ivory  has persisted in africa for years it
is to the effect that somewhere in the heart of the dark continent lies a
valley to which since the beginning of time the elephants have gone to die
it is very strange that the carcasses of elephants dead from natural causes
are never found in the jungle study of this phenomenon leads men to believe
that the giant beasts sensing old age or disease retire to some remote secret
valley there to die amid the whitened bones of their forbears
    it is believed that a very few of the native chieftains knew of the where-
abouts of this mine of wealth but they have never related it to any white
man recently however a noted african outlaw who has tired of his life
of crime has offered to reveal the spot if he is granted amnesty and a reward
and it may soon be that the wealth of the  valley of ivory  will be scattered
about the entire world in the form of bits of carving oscar aldrich

upon entering the wedded state and the
lamp shade she just could not start
housekeeping without she was sur-
prised she had got out as well as she
had and her lustrous juicy brown
eyes sparkled with pleasure when she
saw pistachios admiration dripping
from his lambent orbs 
   since nine oclock hyacinth had been
dressing for her avedding aided by
mis shanks-an obliging person when
one paid up in full and more so when
one was not asking any rebate for two
days overpay but every time the
doorbell had rung hyacinth had had
heart failure particularly when the
two installment collectors had called
   grandly mis shanks had told them
they might call at bunglo l in clifton
court any time after two weeks and
get their money by that time she
and her bridegroom-hyacinth that is
not mis shanks-would have returned
from their honeymoon and pistachio
could pay the bills
   bunglo l was the residence she and
pistachio had signed their lives away
to furnish and yesterday they had sent
to it all the product of their joint pur-
chase-to be theirs in two years or so
if lucky
   oooooo - hyacinthus - honey-
you sho does look omnivorous said
pistachio drowning any qualms which
might have been in the bosom of his
milk chocolate amoureuse
   yo aint lookin so mercenary
yosef she chuckled  lawd con-
trol us man yo is shuh abstemious to
observe coyly she laid her head on
his silk striped bosom
    i reckon we bettah take er taxi
said pistachio and mis shanks stand-
ing with her ear glued tightly to the
crack of the parlor door subconscious-
ly telephoned the  private owned
limousine special rates to wedding
parties owned by spider whinnery
    after er justice gets er hitch made
were off on ouah sugahmoon sighed
pistachio mentally recounting the
wealth of his pockets hotel bill boat
fare to catalina for two-no reduction
for married couples-by economy the
two weeks might be stretched to thre
pistachio had asked for two weeks
vacation only but it might be extended
   grandly he spread his wealth upon
the table which held a copy of booker
t washingtons speeches in the exact
center of the burned leather table
cover with its border of flaming poin-
settias intermingled with blazing yellow
california poppies
    there he said grandly  i got
riches gal don that look lak a honeh-
moon an some lef over
    ise got about fo bones masef
announced hyacinth proudly
    fo bones pistachio gasped
 an you been gittin sixteen bucks a
week-all you gots fo bones
    ma goodness boy seems lak you-
alls marryin me foh ma money
giggled hyacinth nervously fler
qualms were returning she reasoned
that this was not an auspicious time to
mention that her trousseau had been so
expensive-that she had been forced to
forego the regular weekly installments
on the portion of their future house-
hold goods which had been in her pos-
session for these past few weeks await-
ing the matrimonial venture and upon
which she had been valiantly payin
in after they were irrevocably tied
would be a better time to speak of that
    how you talk honey pistachio
retorted  marry you foh you money
baby chile if i caint get nough
money to take care o ma lammie i hope
i gits mashed tween them revolutin
doors at the hotel he was in point
of service the oldest and also by far
the most resplendent doorman at a
fashionable hostelry in the heart of the
city hyacinth sighed with bliss
that was the kind of talk she wanted
to hear
   shuah you can-stachy yous
big and strong and got a fine job-an
the stallmints is all up that is most
of them she mentally reserved wish-
ing she hadnt bought that other hat
the lie that binds

why hadnt she made those aluminium
and lampshade payments anyway be-
fore she bought that other hat but
a lady just couldnt go to get married
in a hat like one which nasturtium
pickins had bloomed out in no later
than yesterday
a terrific shock assailed pis-
tachio at her words yesterday
when he had asked for leave of
absence to get married and had gone
blithely to get his personal adornment
he had been flustered true when he
brought out his money to pay for his
outfit he had wondered where that
extra twenty dollars had come from
but in his exalted state he had for-
gotten that hyacinth had handed him
that money with the tender request to
drop by and make the four payments
on the furniture company the radio
store the phonograph and the insur-
ance policy respectively
  it was right and proper that hy-
acinth had been paying for these things
didnt every lady of quality come to
her husband dowered unused to the
process he had forgotten but now
he remembered quite easily should
he confess now 
  he started guiltily-and the moment
passed
  and then mis shanks announced
the taxi shooed them towardthe front
door showered them with rice and old
shoes from beneath a capacious apron
her full set of ivories gleaming mirth-
fully and they were off in the splended
red and gold sedan designated as
 private owned limousine
  no honeymoon should be inter-
rupted and most particularly not by
money matters but the heartbreaking
truth was that the end of the first week
saw hyacinth and pistachio out of
ready money true pistachio had a
swell position but he was temporarily
out of control of it when the evening
of the seventh day found them possess-
ed of but hyacinths fo bones they
decided on a quick sally toward their
new home they had stocked their
larder when they sent their furniture
there and there they might hide from
the world for another week quite
economically
  true homecoming was slightly
tinged with danger as each well knew
hyacinth couldnt help thinking that
the payments were now two weeks be-
hind on the aluminium lampshade and
piano and pistachio knew well that he
owed a plenty on the rest of their lares
and penates however with a flourish
he inserted the key in the lock of
bunglo l and welcomed his bride the
rent was paid at least
   missis crumb- he said grandilo-
quently favoring her with his entire
set of teeth and-a good set it was
 make yosef acquaintom with yo
future home barrin battles and funr-
als i wishes you luck-
   aint it grand sighed hyacinth
who had intrusted the placing of her
treasures to stash  taint evbodys
got such internal decorations
  pistachio started the phonograph to
hide his temerity at her mention of
their possessions he was glad that
a blush didnt show on him and hya-
cinth bridelike drew the blinds clos-
ing out the neighbors in the court
  it was early the next morning and
the blinds were still lowered that two
callers came to bunglo l in rapid suc-
cession
  you heah at stashy whispered
hyacinth
  heah it could i stop from
heahin it sound lak a clap o doom
said stashy who was nearly right
   shell i go an see whom it maht
be  she asked timorously  it must
be one of the installment men now
trouble would engulf her
   you shell sit wheah you am at-
hissed stashy which was at the break-
fast table and he shifted his knees un-
der their burden
  who you reckin at is she
quavered
   somebody thout no brains he re-

argosy-allstory weekly
plied  let him bang wes still off
on ouah honeymoon it must be the
piano or the furniture man after
awhile stashy would go down to the
hotel and make a touch and slip around
and pay those bills on second thought
-not to the hotel there was a little
matter of five bones to the head bell-
man-slightly overdue well-hed
go somewhere
departing footsteps now came
to their straining ears abruptly
hyacinth slipped from her lords
embrace and knelt by the front win-
dow
    white patv stoppin at the front
bunglo she reported
  the front bunglo was occupied by
a person of some importance deep dig-
nity and a too-carrying voice distin-
guished mr grimes the overseer for
the court who bore the title agent
with no little pride
   agent talkin wid im said hya-
cinth-and then  agents coinin wid
im pistachio now knelt in the pur-
ple and orange bathrobe beside the
sister anne on watch the agent
pushed the bell heartily and its peal
echoed down the court
   thej- tooken this place some time
ago but ey aint live heah-i suspect
someping ain just convenient yet--
maybe they rent ain up whah else they
at he said
   they is too move in came a
voice from bunglo j  i sawn em
lass night come sneakin in late
   at so  queried mr grimes
   an they aint nevah come out
shrilled the human newspaper
   pistachio trembled and his bride was
seized with a violent fit of shivering
 git them eyes awaj from at crack
they bug out white as moons see
em sliuah she hissed
  just then another caller made his
way down the concrete walk
   mr crumb live here he inquired
of the agent  that your name
    ise mistah grimes suh said that
dignitary haughtily agent foh de
court mr crumb i blieves and de-
cleahs js a tenement which is con-
verged into this healf residence as a
fack with which i is onfamiliah since
i was pussonly engaged othehwhares
yestiddy and last evenin
   well im looking for a crumb
said the newcomer
    so am i said the first caller
    who you reckon they is and which
they wants hyacinth whispered
  pistachio was breathing heavily
now he had recognized the collector
for the furniture company for he had
come to the hotel to wrest late pay-
ments from another doorman
    oh he replied shakily  i reckon
 thevs a book agent or some advertisin
man wants to sell us somethin know-
in us is new maried
    well i havent any time to hang
around said the second man  but
you tell him that the moller furniture
company collector was here and for
him to hustle down to the store and
make his payments theres three due
 moller- gasped hyacinth who
had firmly believed it was her own
delinquency which was about to be
shown up  moller-three pay-
ments- of course there would have
been one payment due-one weeks-
for they had been on their honeymoon
but she had given pistachio the money
to make two weeks payments at that
store the day before the wedding
   pistachio crumb ain you made
them payments she accused
   thes some kin mistake honey-
nobuddv been to ast me for no-
   is you yes or aint you no
   don you make so much noise
member what a perpendicular position
yous in is you threatenin me
jes you answer me get it over
and say so and then splain how come
pistachio was saved by another inter-
ference it seemed that all the trouble
in the world was coming at once the
honey hive was threatened of its sweet-
 ness
the lie that binds

   miss hyacinth waters stoppin
here- inquired a stranger
   ain know such a pusson replied
the agent
   well she done gib me this ad-
dress this third collector was a per-
son of color  she buy a set of
alumum from me when she live-
through stashs muddled brain
pierced the word  alumum- he
glanced at his bride who had paled
but didnt show it
   whas at  ain you paid them
alumum moneys yo ownsef-an now
i spose you goin say i wuz spose to
tend to that-
   it bade fair to be a battle but the
sudden withdrawal of the callers
cleared the air and restored peace and
confessions with the honeymoon at-
mosphere winning out midafternoon
they quietly ventured forth and had a
restaurant dinner and saw a movie
after the agent had gone out
  the next morning pistachio agreed
with hyacinth that it was a prudent
move not to raise the blinds which
was right for by noon seven of the
hated genus collectorum had visited
the  bunglo  and then the agent and
not appreciating the game he was
generous with information
    you get me a key said one  and
ill back up the van and get our stuff
 at the hotel where he works they
said he was on a vacation if he can
take vacations he can pay his phono-
graph payments-
   we gotta get some money said
pistachio  they-all gettin had
about it how much we got in money
babe it appeared that little more
than one lone dollar remained
   gimme it ill step down town and
raise a little cash somewhere
   he recalled a nice quiet little game
in the back of hip fillets pool hall
on central avenue down in the heart
of the colored district jefferson ave-
nue where they were domiciled was
almost a suburb it was the acme of
colored aristocracy so forth he fared
to run that dollar up to a dozen or
more if a bridegroom be not lucky
who is btjt he did not share his idea
with hyacinth who hopefully watched
him depart watched also the slick mr
grimes depart in his wake and saw
the agent come panting back so he
hadnt caught him
but there was no game back of
hip fillets there was little of
anything a strange quiet per-
vaded central avenue well there
was joe toombs he owed him ten dol-
lars this long while he went to joes
joe from a window laughed gleefully
as he saw stash approaching glad of
his immunity for there was a small-
pox scare abroad and joes house was
one with a quarantine sign upon its
door stash stopped outside the fence
and hailed the grinning joe
   yup i know what you wants too
bad stash don reckom well get out-
ta hcah soon
   you got it yelled stash
   nope but old lady was ovah to
revrun haknesss house othah day

argosy-allstory weekly
   shet yo mouth ejaculated joe
with pleasure  you certny highfly-
in stash i considah it a honah to
owe money to you slid o to some nig-
gah who owes dime and quarter and
fo-bits like
   nemmine that honah i wants ten
bucks
   come on in and hep me hunt fo
it stash one thing that sign on the
do keeps all the collectahs away from
me- he grinned brazenly
  the phrase rankled stash stood
thinking for a minute then as if he
were going to take joes advice to
come in and help hunt for it he
dashed tip to the door sheltered from
joes eyes by the porch roof a mo-
ment later he dashed out again and
joe breathed easier stash had looked
 kinda desprit -he was glad he went
away
  stash next tried the hotel but the
manager was away on a little trip of his
own and the other doorman was uni-
versally bankrupt he got a dollar
from the head bellman and went dis-
consolately back home
 well heah i is and lucky you is to
get me he said spreading a little
propaganda  smallpox nigh got me
 you got no money his bride de-
manded
   how could i get money walk
in and snatch it from a corpse which
oe toombss goin to be befo he gets
well
  he got it
   no but he say he goin to get it
an he say it keep stallmint men away
so i done the same for us
  got it too she gasped in hor-
ror backing away
  not smallpox-the sign which says
it and he dragged from beneath his
coat the offending sign which had been
on toes door now the stallmint men
could pester joe in peace we put
is sign on our do an they leave us
be see honey lamb
  hyacinth agreed that it was a grand
idea and after he had come back
from investing the dollar in staple gro-
ceries they affixed the sign with wire
and great glee that would keep folks
from bothering while stash could get
out to rustle some cash or maybe go
back to work but that would be a
last resort
  they could hardly wait for the
morning to see the faces of the visitors
who should come and did it work
their ringside seats were worth the
money one after another those men
white or colored came looked once
and went rapidly from that place by
noon the last one had come and gone
then the agent who had just got up
evidently came out and saw the sign
he also departed thence speedily
talking it over at breakfast the
crumbs had decided that stash
had better go back and tell the
hotel he didnt want the rest of his
leave of absence that he was ready to
work now and they could leave the
sign up until their first pay day
  resplendent in her violet kimono
and with a pink silk rose in her hair
hyacinth stood in the doorway and saw
her husband go swinging down the
court but he stopped swinging as the
door of the first bunglo opened
stopped and threw his arms aloft
and then mr grimes came into the
area way in his hand something that
looked suspiciously like a double-bar-
reled shotgun it was a double-bar-
reled shotgun
   i guess you at mistah crumb
which evbody wants- he said nastily
 wheah you-all goin
   just down to wok- said stash
hands still aloft  what for at gun
mistah
   reckom you-all bettah crawl back
in yo hole at sign on yo do say
you-all got smallpox an gotta stay
home an you goin do it
   sign dont mean nothin- said
pistachio jauntily
   maybe you dont believe in em but

the lie that binds

 specially at kind track back cul-
lud man or i jes nacherally got to
perpetrate you lak a sieve
  faces brown yellow and ebon ap-
peared at windows along the line
voices sounded from within doors
and pistachio backtracked reluctantly
when he had got inside and closed the
door mr grimes disappeared
   dont show yo face- he cau-

sadly

idea an now at the first little mistake
which incurs you staht bellerin- for
hyacinth had begun to whisper
   whut we goin do stave 
   ats right-i spose you wish
youd married some rich man-
  suddenlv hyacinth began to giggle
   stash
   whut is it lamb penitently
   hot dog she grinned  you put
at sign up
   you seen me -wonderingly
   well-you take it down
   funny with me genrally the smat
one you should think o that-
stashy grinned and opening the door
he ripped the sign from the screen
which started another ball rolling
third bunglo down the court had been
watching and a telephone call was on
the wire before stash could adjust the
yellow fedora inside bunglo l how-
ever there was only a confident fare-
well both felt happier now stashy
was going down to get his job back
it was a lingering farewell so finally
as he tore himself from his wifes em-
brace three white men came rushing
up the court leaving a motor running
at the curb
   whats this about a broken quar-
antine demanded one of the men of
stash who was the only person in
sight  which house 
   i aint know no quarantine said
stash modestly
  the curtain at the near-by window
shook and a shrill voice poured
through a windows crack  ats him
right there he lives at the bunglo at
the back just tore at quaramtine sign
down hisself i seen him
   was there a sign up on your
house demanded the caller
  stash began to get cold in the pit of
his stomach what was he going to do
now would he have to admit that
he stole the sign from joe toombss
house thereby turning loose upon a
helpless world the danger of the dread
disease by contact with joes family-
if joe should happen to learn that the
sign was gone-or must he meekly ad-
mit that there had been a sign on his
own door and allow them to draw their
own conclusions
   well- pistachio temporized
 sign was-er-was a sign-
   who took it down  ouarantine
officer
   i ain just know about-
   he did too take it down his own-
sef- came the relentless voice from
behind the curtain in bunglo h
   did you  demanded the officer
   oh-at funny joke sign-oh
that- stash tried to be nonchalant
   thats against the law you know
that dont you
   i ain heard bout no law yes-
sah-
   you get inside there fellow and
make it fast- said another  well
just seal the doors this time and set a
guard at the court entrance business-
like sound that had
   i caint go on in-
   just get back in there now and
nothing more about it heavily and
stashy got back in  how we goin
eat he asked plaintively
   telephone your orders out and
have the goods delivered to the guard
we leave said the other

argosy-allstory weekly

    we aint got no telephone sighed
stash
mr grimes was called to the
conference about this time and
his shotgun was much in evi-
dence with stash inside the officers
closed and wired the screen doors tight-
ly produced another quarantine sign
as if by magic and departed leaving
starvation vexation desperation and
separation in their wake for now hya-
cinth declared that if she ever got out
of this house without having smallpox
or being starved to death she was  go-
in get a divoce fum any fool man

tears flowed freely drowning pis-
tachios anger making him more mis-
erable

  then they quit speaking by mid
afternoon pistachio had discovered that
if he pulled down the bedroom window
from the top-the bedroom being at
the back of the bunglo-that he could
crawl over the top of the high board
fence which obstructed their view from
that room landing in the alley he
immediately put his discovery into
practice as regards marital conditions
by this time suffice it to say hyacinth
kissed him as he started out
across the alley a couple of num-
i bers down in the upper window
of a two-story house a lady of
color who had been reading a hair-rais-
ing tale in a magazine reached for her
telephone a dark form had just vault-
ed a high fence aftd was coming down
the alley yes sir she thought of her
red glass beads and her wrist watch
people had been killed for less and
blood would spoil her bedroom rug
miraculously the colored patrolman on
the beat was leaning against the pole
which held his callbox so that when
pistachio reached the extremity of the
alley and was about to come out into
civilization once more he was met by
this minion of the law
   goin down town  asked the dark-
hued officer this certainly was a
strange nigger in this neighborhood he
had this beat two years and never
had seen this bird before  ill just
walk along with you mmmhhm

hood for

ing did the officer know about the

regis to get some money explained
pistachio naively

ley

argosy-allstory weekly
hell furnish you a nice little place to
spend your honeymoon all right-
and willy-nilly pistachio went down
   night fell and back in bunglo l an
anguished bride lay upon her green
plush couch weeping until eyelids were
a rosy chocolate no money no food
and now no husband her wails rent
the night air
    say you stop hollerin an come to

treasure from the stars
ut in arizona in the canon diablo section a new attempt is being started
to unearth the treasures locked in a lost baby world whichthousands of
years ago crashed into the earth a huge flaming meteor burying itself deep
in the ground and leaving above it on the surface as its monument a crater
like an embryonic volcano
     confident that they have located the mass of the meteor at last eastern
interests have announced plans for sinking a shaft to about one thousand feet
at which depth a cross-cut will be driven to the mysterious lost body and its
riches will be mined and recovered
     for more than a generation geologists and mining men have studied
and prospected the queer crater which marks the grave of the meteor thou-
sands of particles of meteoric matter scattered about the vicinity told them
that here a tiny lost world had crashed down to its grave but the meteor had
struck at an angle and was not directly below the crater so for a long time
prospecting by drilling test holes was fruitless
     the lost meteor weighs thousands of tons geologists confidently predict
and is expected to be composed mainly of iron nickel and similar meteoric
metals expected to be worth at least sixty-five dollars a ton and probably a
great deal more
     but here is where the fascination and lure of the venture comes in
nobody has ever before cut into such a huge treasure trove of the infinite
as this  nobody knows just exactly what will be found when the drills and
blasting penetrate into the lost baby world in the tinv pieces cast off on
the surface as the meteor plunged down to its fiery grave have been found
traces of the precious metals gold silver platinum and even tiny diamonds
there is more than a possibility that inside the great meteor may be found
gigantic diamonds and a treasure trove of precious metals that will stagger the
imagination	foster-harris

the golden traitor
a fortune in transit-while thieves and traitors hovered close and strove to
enrich themselves at the governments expense in those stirring days
when uncle sam moved from philadelphia to washington
by r des horn
leading up to this installment
a young kentuckian named an-	this is about the year  when
drew king has just reached	the government of the united states
 the city of philadelphia where	is engaged in moving its capital its of-
his uncle has sent him to his friend	fice records its treasury and the house-
thomas calthorpe to finish his educa-	hold effects of its members down to the

  andrew has on backwoods clothes	columbia on the shores of the

wont laugh at his suit of buckskin	ernmental moving plans but he has
he intends to buy city clothes the next	traveled enough in the wild territories
day	beyond the appalachian mountains to
this story began in the argosy-allstory weekly for september 
 
eagerly beiton plunged his hands inside
the golden traitor

know that the innkeeper he has put up
with for the night did not want him for
a guest and that all the other guests of
the inn are extremely evil-looking cut-
throats
   one thin-lipped young man is an ex-
ception to this he introduces him-
self to andrew as  stephen matte-
son seems agitated when he finds out
andrew is going to see mr calthorpe
and suspects andrew of knowing some-
thing about a shipload of household
goods that  matteson  says he knows
is on the way being moved for govern-
ment attaches
   mr calthorpe is one of these gov-
ernment attaches by the way stephen
adds without telling andrew in what
capacity
  however before andrew has much
time to think about whether mr cal-
thorpe is still in philadelphia or not all
the rascals in the inn set upon two
heavily cloaked travelers who come in
to wait while their coachman fixes their
broken-down coach
   the one traveler a stocky quick
man stands off all the cutthroats with
a sword for a long time until his com-
panion apparently a slender youth
escapes by a window during the melee
and still heavily cloaked rides oft
on andrewss fine kentucky stallion
satan
   andrew mixes in the fray later just
after matteson is called mat-
thews  by the short stout quick
stranger-and just before the stout
man is knocked out by an enormous
sea captain named benton 
  after disabling a couple of men
andrew manages to get away on a
saddled horse which he later manages
to exchange with an escaping girl for
his own horse satan which she cannot
handle
   together they ride on and just as
they reach a group of men among
whom the girl calls for lieutenant wil-
berforce they find they have really
ridden into an ambush men pull the
girl from her horse and when andrew
struggles against the same medicine
some of the men knock him down and
out
chapter iv
bound and gagged
the first things i knew after that
were a terrific headache and a dis-
cordant sound-creak crunch-
creak crack crunch then as i felt
a sudden violent lurch i realized it was
the noise of heavy cart wheels over an
uneven road and that i was riding in
one of the carts
   i tried to sit up and found i could
not my hands and feet were tied
and also across my mouth a cloth was
bound the bonds were not painful in
their tightness yet when i tried to slip
my wrists in them i found they held me
securely
  whose prisoner was i  where were
they taking me i wondered what
had become of my comrade the girl in
the boys clothing
  thinking perchance i might hear
something to enlighten me from the
men whom i could hear talking in low
voices about me i lay quiet listening
as keenly as i could but all i could
hear was talk of ships and soldiers
   but presently i heard the galloping
of a distant horse coming ever nearer
i felt the wagon i was in halt heard
the sounds of men running forward or
scattering in the bushes roundabout
and then the faint click of firearms
being reprimed
   as the clatter of hoofs beat loud and
near from ahead came a sharp chal-
lenge  halt whos there 
   its me hayes-you fool bap-
tiste you where is barbary 
  from almost alongside me then
called a deep bass voice so nearly
exactly that of the sea captain benton
that i almost jumped  here i am
hayes what is it and how is
everything at the blue anchor
the rider was by now so close that
	argosy-allstory weekly
i could even see the loom of his head
and shoulders above the cart wherein i
lay bound his voice shrilled ex-
citedly you got them barbary
you got them then
  the deep voice beside me laughed
as right as a trivet walked right
in among us the lieutenant and all his
hayfoots and now theyre tied tip as
tight as quill-pigs in farmer patter-
sons stable the first whisper theyll
be able to give will be when the stable
boy finds them and cuts them loose to-
morrow morning
  but the chests youve got the
chests the horsemans voice was
quivering with eagerness  youve
got them-in the wagons here
  he rode closer and his shoulders
loomed as though he were leaning over
to make certain for himself but sud-
denly i saw a great hand clap down on
his shoulder so roughly as almost to
unseat him
  avast there roared barbarys
bass voice  time enough aboard the
saucy mary but what word brought
you speak your message man is
the schooner ready and benton
and the rest
  yes everythings right replied
the other though in very surly tones
 the schooners ready at black cove
and alls waiting these four hours why
didnt you send word
  send word cried the man bar-
bary  i did a full hour ago the
minute we had the stuff safe i sent one
of bentons rascals on horseback to
bring you word
  was your messenger a fair-sized
hook-nosed man with an old scar from
his ear to his gullet demanded hayes
   aye thats the rascal responded
barbary did he not tell you
no and for reasons enough an-
swered hayes shortly  the first
we saw of him was when we found him
a-sprawl in the stable opening and
shutting his mouth and gasping like a
trout out of water and knowing no
more of what had fetched him the
great crack on the sconce than that
same trout
   you mean some one bagged him
and got away to tell cried barbary
fiercely
  not one but hvo retorted the
other seemingly pleased at bringing
some provocation to barbary in return
for the rough clap on the shoulder
 spite o all the money we had given
the coachman to keep him away who
should come snooping but old pokey-
nose himself not only comes snoop-
ing-
  the deep-voiced man interrupted
with a roar of surprise and anger
 that rascal of a coachman let himi
come a-spying
   he claimed he could not stop him
responded hayes  twice he fixes
the wheel-pin to come out and the
second time pokey-nose threatens to
crack his head if it happen again so
our prudent coachman brings him next
to the blue anchor so we might fall on
him and stop his spying for good
  we went for pokey-nose all right
and he fights like a wildcat and slices
half a dozen before bully benton gets
him at last with a wood billet but the
boy that was with pokey-nose slips
away out of the window and neither
hide nor hair have we been able to find
of him since
   slipped away-got away from the
whole dozen of you demanded bar-
bary furiously
   aye and thats not the worst o
it answered hayes  in the midst
of the fight who should come butting in
but a forest runner who has the bad
luck to be there a-stopping at the
inn despite all old grobel could do to
prevent
   comes butting in knifes benton
through the arm slashes joriss face
and gets away on your messengers
horse-at least thats how we figured
finding your man kicking and his horse
nowhere in sight
  hayes gave a soulful curse  now
by my belief theyre turning out the
the golden traitor

  whole country and well have trouble
a-plenty before we sight blue water
again 
but all of a sudden the man bar-
bary began to chuckle-great
 pleased chuckles that sounded in
the dark like water tumbling over
rocks your forest fellow you all
but laid hands on a moment since when
you pried into this wagon and the
boy that escaped you through the win-
dow youll find in the next wagon
ahead likewise bound hand and foot
 in the wagons-here cried
hayes amazed then with compre-
hension  they rode right toward you
thinking you were the soldiers
   right into our hands laughed
barbary yelling to us to turn back to
the city straightaway so if theyre all
thats to raise the country we can take
years to get back aboard the saucy
mary
   however with dawn coming and
no chests in sight the men on the gov-
ernment ship will be getting curious so
wed best be marching along hi
there stir yourselves you lubbers
dye want to take all night to travel a
few short miles
   then having sent another messenger
off to direct the party at the blue
anchor to join him at the schooner it-
self barbary again took up the con-
versation with hayes  so the forest
fellow actually stuck a knife into bully
benton did he
   pinned his arm against the wall
with a thrown knife at a dozen paces
grunted hayes  myself i dont fear
any ordinary man in fair fight but
spare me from any of these wild half-
indians out of the woods cut your
throat at a dozen paces distance and
then scalp you to boot-the bloody
danl boones
  barbary seemed to find in the tale
something of great humor he chuckled
again more gleefully than ever  and
benton is raging mad  suppose
    hes fit to pull the fellow apart
 with his bare hands if he could but lay
 them on him responded hayes  he
 wont live long that forest loper after
 he gets aboard the saucy mary thats
 certain
   then their figures vanished out of
 my sight and their voices died away
 under the club of their horses hoofs
 by which i judged they were riding
 forward toward the van of the party
   as the realization came that i would
 not be the only prisoner at bully ben-
 tons mercy that she would be there
 too-that mysterious soft-voiced com-
 panion of my moonlight ride-i
 strained at my bonds until they cut deep
 into my arms and legs but the deftness
 of the knots finally made me give over
 in despair
  at last with a lurch the wheels
stopped i was lifted from the wagon
and carried along by two men as un-
ceremoniously as if i had been a log
there were lanterns around and by
their flickering light i could see rough-
ly clad men mostly sailors coming and
going in the gloom
   ahead i heard barbarys great voice
 raised and saw the sailors leap to obey
 hence i set him down as one of the
 ships officers probably second to cap-
 tain benton himself
   a chest borne carefully by two men
 swung up a slanted plank ahead of me
 and then i too was borne up this same
 narrow plank and onto the vessel that
 was moored to great trees close at the
 waterside
   then i was carried through a nar-
 row door and into a cabin dimly light-
 ed by candles in metal holders where i
 was unceremoniously dumped down on
 the floor beside the chest that had come
 aboard ahead of me
   the cabin wherein i lay was strik-
 ingly different in size from the cabins
 of the trading vessels which i had seen
 at new orleans they had been built
 to carry as much goods as possible and
 their cabins had been all tiny affairs
 not high enough for a medium-sized
 man even to stand erect in

argosy-allstory weekly
  but this was no cabin of a trader
jealous for cargo space in height the
ceiling overhead was a good dozen feet
above the deck beneath and there were
doors leading out into what i took to be
smaller sleeping cabins on either side
with perhaps a storeroom or two
  there was a stout table in the center
and a pair of benches and a chair a
couple of cutlasses crossed on pins in
the wall and an arms rack with half a
dozen muskets
  this much i saw before the men
came again bringing another chest like
the one in the corner where i lay this
too they brought in and set down close
alongside and went out again
  and then one of the side cabin doors
opened and through it came the man
whom at his first word i knew to be
barbary he carefully fastened the
side-cabin door with a bar that fell in-
to cleats both on the door and the
frames on either side humming as he
did so in an easy jaunty manner
  still humming he lighted two great
candles which with their candlesticks
he took from a cupboard on the wall
and placed them on the table quickly
he examined each of the chests and
then leaving them he came and stood
over me his face smiling as with satis-
faction
   ah-h-h my horseback-riding dan-
iel boone said he cheerfully and
how do you like your new life now
that youve quit your forest running
and come to start a-sailoring
  the extra candles not being m lan-
terns shone brightly on his face he
was almost as big in body as benton
but there the resemblance ended
  barbarys chin was square his lips
firm his eyes keen and his full fore-
head rose to a great unruly mass of
dark brown hair the face was that of
a strong man one who recognized no
master
  i rolled my eyes and worked my iace
to call his attention in hopes that he
might remove the gag from my mouth
but he only smiled and shook his head
   nay youll have to put up with it
a while longer there are government
ships in the river and no telling how
many other manner of boats about to
hear a shout if one were raised when
were once clear of the river maybe
well free you of it meantime lets
see that your knots are not too tight for
reasonable comfort
  he knelt and examined my knots
patting them he rose to his feet just as
another chest was brought in  right
enough they are if youll but lie quiet
he was just turning away when an-
other subdued clamor arose outside
the voices of men and the tramping of
feet and above all the voices a great
roaring one whose very first oath set
me quivering
   ah-h he comes exclaimed this
strange man barbary beside me  the
captain comes-bully benton the cap-
tain  and then to my infinite sur-
prise he turned to me and gravely
winked one eye at me  but you cant
always tell how bold a man is by the
sound of his roaring daniel boone
 chapter v
 down the river
with a grating of hinges the
door that led out onto the open
deck burst open and a swirl of 
cooler air came in and the creak of
tackle and the rustle of canvas sails
from which i knew the ship was un-
moored and getting under way then
the door closed again and there in the
candlelight stood gross captain benton
  he was somewhat sobered but the
redness of liquor had given way to the
ruddiness of anger and pain around
his arm where i had cut it was wound
a dirty bandage and his face was
twisted with brutal malevolence
   damn the plot that sent me to a
madhouse inn to get my arm sliced
while you ambush a few mollycoddles
of soldiers he burst out furiously
glaring at barbary the while he felt
the golden traitor

tenderly of his bandage  and damme
if i havent half a notion that you and
matteson knew it would be so
  barbary only laughed  fiddle-
sticks  he said  it was yourself that-
proposed the stopping at the blue an-
chor in case of chance guards coming
from the government ship if you get
sliced it was your own fault i wager
however theres that in the corner
here that will cure all your injuries i
doubt not eh
  he waved a careless hand toward the
chests packed around me
  the sight of those square box-like
things in the shadows truly seemed to
make benton forget all about the pain
of his wounds he dropped his band-
aged hand on the table without even
wincing the chests he cried
eagerly  smash then open fetch an
ax and lets have a look at this fortune
inside em-eh matteson
  as he stumbled forward i saw that
behind him was the mysterious man
matteson or matthews as i had heard
him called also he came forward and
dropped heavily onto the bench beside
the table
  not a glance did he give toward the
chests instead he leaned forward
with elbows on table and his head
bowed in his hands so that his voice
sounded as muffled and lifeless as a
voice from the tomb itself  open
them an you choose said he
  barbary stared first at him and then
at benton in manifest surprise  what
is it thats troubling him he demand-
ed of benton  he looks as if hed
seen a ghost
  benton snorted in high impatience
leave him to his ghosts and come
give me a hand with these chests
  still barbary stood staring at matte-
son though as if feeling the keen
gaze matteson lifted his bowed head
and let his hands fall heavily on the
table  aye i have seen a ghost this
night said he nodding  the ghost of
mv honor
  his voice and looks were even more
ghastly than they had been back in the
blue anchor just before i ran from
the tavern it fairly sent shivers up
and down my back
  yet the hulking benton nly laughed
coarsely and stumped forward to lay
hands to the chests for the first time
he spied me lying bound there in the
shadows he stepped back in surprise
then  body o me he cried  if
its not the same buckskin rascal with
the throwing knife
  then with another great bellow
benton snatched at the pistol in his
waist  by the shin-bones of satan
but i have him now bound hand and
foot all ready for the reckoning
  even as i closed my eyes against
the inevitable flash and roar i heard
barbarys cool voice break in vast
there avast hes not your priscner
but mine youve had your chance at
him already at the tavern and made
naught of it leave him alone i tell
you
  opening my eyes then i saw bar-
bary grasping so tightly the lock of
bentons pistol that the flint could not
fall onto the steel and though ben-
ton cursed and jerked to pull it loose
he quickly perceived that the thing was
as like to go off while pointed toward
himself as anywhere else and so wisely
gave over though not without much
swearing  body o davy jones he
cried  but one would think it was
you that was captain here and not me
   no said barbary humoringly yet
standing sturdily between myself and
the furious captain  i know my place
as mate very well aboard but its
yourself that forgets sometimes who is
oivner is it not
   anyway you know the agreement
-each to his own booty apart from
the general scheme the wagons and
all they contained were fair spoil for
general division yes but the lad here
is separate booty unforeseen and in-
divisible if you are so anxious for
your share of the prizes you had best
stick to the chests here-

argosy-allstory weekly
  with a kick and a snarl that told
plainly enough that if he did give over
his intentions against me it was only
for the time being benton laid hold
with barbary of one of the chests and
hoisted it onto the table there with
knife and pistol they broke the lock
open and lifted the lid eagerly ben-
ton plunged his hands inside-and then
seemed suddenly to become a raving
maniac
  tricked he roared jerking his
hands out and holding them high
 tricked some one has beaten us to
it theres naught here but worthless
scraps of paper
  while he danced and howled with
madman fury the fluttering pieces of
paper he had grabbed out of the chest
came whirling onto the table the floor
and even onto my face
  yet barbary never altered his smile
as for matteson he did not even
bother to glance up from his somber
staring at the planks of the table top
   you have but broached the first of
the chests said barbary smoothly
 there are still two others left per-
haps one of them will contain things
more to your liking
  but the second chest proved to con-
tain only similar blank papers
with the third and last chest
though i could see bentons
face come afire with excitement
again from amid a plenteous packing
of cotton lint which overflowed onto
the floor as he unpacked it he drew
forth a small but heavy box that gave
forth a thrilling clink as he dropped
it heavily on the table
  the top sticking even after he had
pried at it with his knife he upended
the small box in an excess of im-
patience and hammered it on the bot-
tom so that the whole contents came
out suddenly with a clank and clang
of metal and then once again benton
seemed to become a crazy man in his
rage and fury
  all that i could see were several thick-
ish metal plates glinting dully in the
candlelight
  in truth no man outside of bedlam
could have acted as benton did then
he frothed wordless blasphemy beat-
ing on the table with both fists glaring
alternately at both barbary and matte-
son
  barbary only continued to smile as
for matteson he had not once glanced
sidewise or once changed expression
during the whole of the unboxing it
was this utter indifference that seemed
to center the captains rage on him
benton all at once whirled on him
   i knew you were lying-you with
your smooth ways and fancy graces
he cried  youve tricked us youve
fetched us on a wild-goose chase and
by the eternal bully benton is not the
man to be tricked by any one
  he had jerked out his pistol as he
spoke the weapon quivering in his
rage-palsied hands swift death leered
out from that black muzzle yet matte-
son never so much as flickered an
eyelid
   why dont you shoot  he de-
manded carelessly  the bullet would
be merciful only it had been luckier
for me had you done this the first
time i met you
  for a full half minute these two
faced each other across the table
matteson smiling his unconcerned
smile while bentons finger quivered on
the trigger nor did barbary inter-
fere either he too sat half disdain-
ful half smiling and then suddenly
benton dropped his pistol on the table
covering his discomfiture under a great
volley of oaths and barbary laughed
outright
   i knew he would outstare you if
you let him live the first ten seconds
benton he cried  but it is better
so-you would have been as foolish as
the farmer oaf that killed his hen that
laid the golden eggs put up your
pistols and let us three take counsel
as to what wre shall do toward getting
away safe with our spoils
the golden traitor

   spoils  roared benton  black-
smiths metal and blank paper and
this fancy gentleman here -indicat-
ing matteson -  promised us the
wealth of the treasury
  for another full minute barbary
stared at benton a cold glance of sheer
disgust  fool said he at last  do
you think then that wealth can only
be in gold and silver look
  swiftly he brought forth a horn of
ink from the wall cupboard and with
it he thoroughly daubed the surface of
one of the plates on the table this
inked plate he then pressed down firmly
atop one of the blank sheets of paper on
the table at the same time with his
free hand he brought forth from his
pocket a green-tinted bank note then
as he flipped the plate aside and held
up the two bits of paper for compari-
son my heart almost skipped a beat
in its excitement
  save that the new printed sheet was
black where the other was green they
might have been twin bank notes from
the same press
  even benton was held spellbound at
the sight  you-you mean these are
the printing plates from which the gov-
ernment prints these same bank notes 
he demanded at last
   that and naught else said bar-
bary nodding amiably  yet not the
plates from which the notes themselves
are printed but the master plates from
which those other printing plates are
made for a printing plate becomes
worn-out in time from much printing
and must be replaced with others ex-
actly alike it these master plates are
the common model for them all and
they are more real even than the real
printing plates
  the realization that the possessing
of those innocent-looking plates was as
good as possessing the national treas-
ury itself almost set my eyes bulging
from my head but to my surprise
benton fingering the real bank note
and comparing it with the inky plate
seemed manifestly disappointed  i
thought it was the actual money we
wrere going to get he grumbled his
mouth turning down sullenly
  barbary sniffed money said
he  and why should they be sending
good money from the governments
safe vaults here to the feeble protection
of the half finished buildings in the
new village of washington do you
think
   why any drunken rabble on the
road might hear of it-or as for that
matter a soldier or two of the escort
with so much ready money in sight
might think the prospect of a fortune
well worth the risk of hanging for
treason and so see tp it themselves
that it did not reach the vaults in
washington no the officials of the
government especially old pokey-
nose were too wise to risk gny such
results
   but they sent these plates argued
benton dully
   aye but disguised as mere house-
hold goods of pokey-nose and not as
money or anything else worth the steal-
ing and ill wager the escort save
the lieutenant in charge were equally
in ignorance that it was other than
household goods they attended aye
and that they are even now kicking
their heels in pattersons barn with
w-onder as to why a lot of highway-
men should have so great a hankering
for candlesticks and wool-cards and
such
but bentons mentality was evi-
dently not of a proportion to his
gross bulk his eyes blinked as
he poked at the inky plate again and
then he carelessly picked up one of the
blank sheets of paper that had come
out of the other box
   that may be all right for the
plates said he  but why should they
want to send two boxes of paper sheets
along too the escort might better
have been guarding twro boxes of those
same household folderols than these
worthless scraps of paper

argosy-allstory weekly
   worthless eh repeated barbary
 regarding benton queerly he picked
 up the paper sheet benton had been
 poking at looked at it for a moment
 then tore it squarely across and handed
 one torn portion over to the ship cap-
 tain  does that seem no different to
 you from the bits of paper you buy in
 shops to scribble letters on
    its narrower responded benton
 examining it carelessly and casting it
 aside but otherwise for all ican
 see its no different from that same
 paper for scribbling
    well if you made a print with
these plates on that scribbling paper of
yours and then took it into a shop and
tried to pass it as a good bank note
youd soon learn the difference said
barbary dryly  these paper sheets
for printing money are of a peculiar
texture and the lowest shopkeeper of
the lot would see the difference
    but with the plates and this paper
 which i doubt not they were taking to
  washington as standards we will not
 be making counterfeits at all we will
 be making bank notes as real as the
 government itself can make them
 now bentons sluggish brain began
 to work his eyes lighted with satis-
 faction only to grow dull again the
 next moment  if theres special pa-
 per he said grumblingly theres spe
 cial ink too most like theyll have
 their own special ink made no doubt
 and as different from ordinary ink as
 this black stuff in the horn is from the
 green stuff thats on that bank note
 there
   ah now youre beginning to
think cried barbary approvingly
 but ink especially when its dry isnt
so hard to counterfeit as paper of a
particular texture i warrant you there
are a half dozen chemists and apothe-
caries in england or france given that
bank note as a sample could make up
an ink so exactly identical that even
old pokey-nose himself would not rec-
ognize the difference
   the glow of satisfaction crept back
to bentons eyes a tinge of greediness
came into his voice  then thats the
plan is it we go somewhere to
france or spain or england get the
ink made and then set up our own
printing press with these plates and
blank papers and print as much money
as we want is that it
  youve grasped the idea admir-
ably grinned barbary  and i al-
ready have in mind a chemist in re-
gents lane that will fix us to a dukes
taste but before we get to the thames
we will have to get clear of the dela-
ware here and thats as full of twists
and turns as a scalded snake
   and as it was my part of the bar-
gain to provide the ship and attend to
the ambuscade ashore so it is yours to
pilot the saucy mary safe to sea so
up to your post man before the bosun
runs her high and dry on a mud-bar
  at that the man matteson who had
never once looked at the plates since
they had first been dumped on the table
nor for that matter looked at anything
other than the table top under his very
eyes got up heavily and went out the
cabin croor onto the deck
  benton started to follow got as far
as the cabin door and then suddenly
halted and turned around he came
back and standing by the table looked
long and insolently at barbary  those
plates he said  for things so valu-
able theyre very small and easy to be
gotten away with and theres dark
narrow places in the river here where
a fellow could drop the gig overside
and be gone with plates and papers be-
fore the rest of us could even suspect
  barbarys eyes flashed  do you
mean to say he said sharply that
you question the honesty of myself or
major matteson for none others ex-
cept yourself are allowed in the cabin
here
  but benton stood his ground sul-
lenly  when it comes to money im
not trusting anybody said he sulkily
 ive been tricked before i bought
this ship for you and hired this crew
the golden traitor

and attended to things ashore and by
heaven im going to make certain i
get my share of the booty
   scoundrel cried barbary drop-
ping a hand to his pistol butt  have
a care what you say im not the man
to be bearded by a fellow on my own
ship be he captain or not ive cap-
tained too many ships o my own for
that
   aye but you didnt sail em in as
crooked and narrow a stream as this
same delaware grinned benton leer-
ingly you may have plundered
spanish ships in the gulf as ive
heard but i have no fear of you im
the only man aboard can get this
schooner out of the river before the
government ships catch us and you
know it
   yes and if they catch us youll
hang just as high for piracy as i will
myself for all my work in the cubas
retorted barbary  i dont fancy they
will look too kindly on the stealing of
those plates we might just as well have
sacked the treasury itself but if
naught else will satisfy you i will pad-
lock the precious plates in the chest in
my sleeping cabin and you may carry
the key in your own pocket
  he placed the plates back in their
box and was reaching for the bar-latch
of the side-cabin door whence i had
seen him emerge earlier when sudden-
ly he became aware that benton was
following close at his elbow  how
now  he demanded  what is it you
want this time 
  benton put one finger beside his nose
in a knowing manner  there are
chests and chests and keys and keys
said he  but if- i was right there to
see now there wouldnt be no doubts
that id be carrying the key to the
chest that had the plates inside it
would there
  so fast barbary whirled on him
then and so black was the look in bar-
barys eyes that i in my corner ex-
pected blood spilled and without an-
other moments delay even benton
surly as he was stepped back a
pace
   no one enters that cabin but my-
self cried barbary  and by the
gods if you dont take yourself out of
this cabin and out of my sight this mo-
ment you swashbuckling fish-captain
you ill pistol you where you stand and
run the risk of grounding the ship in
strange channels myself
  his free hand was twitching so ner-
vously at his pistol butt that the gross
sea captain lingered not in his going
he went out through the little passage
precipitately yet he was careful to
let his parting sentence come mumbling
audibly back to the ears of barbary in
the main cabin and so perforce to mine
also
   body o me if i dont believe
theres some particular reason why you
dont want me inside that cabin o
yours he snarled and by your shin-
bones o satan if youve got more
booty hidden there from a fair division
youll find bully benton is no easy man
to cheat o shares
chapter vi
a promise
for a second after benton had gone
barbary stood looking after him
his mouth grim with anger then
suddenly he laughed tossed the plates
back carelessly on the table and seat-
ing himself lighted his tobacco pipe
  for a little while the place was silent
save for the creak of canvas and cord-
age outside the tramp of sailors feet
forward and overhead and the sztnsh
swish of water around and below
  in my corner i writhed with weari-
ness and striving to roll into an easier
position i accidentally gave one of the
chests a knock with my knee so that
it sounded in the silence as loud as a
drum
  instantly barbary was on his feet
and whirled about a cocked pistol
ready in his hand for a second he

argosy-allstory weekly
peered about then as if satisfying him-
self whence the noise had come he put
away his pistol and came over to where
 lay in the corner
  he stood staring down at me as si-
lent as a ghost while his brow fur-
rowed with thought then he bent
down and my eyes bulged and my
heart for a moment ceased beating at
sight of a long knife in his hand
   to my utter surprise this peculiar
man knelt beside me and slipped the
gag out of my mouth and stared nar-
rowly into  eyes and  daniel
boone said he softly  are you a man
of honor
   slowly then i managed to answer as
well as my stiff lips would let me i
have never-been doubted as such-
yet i mumbled
   then give me your word quickly
said barbary  that if i loose you now
you will say naught to any one of this
ship or anything on it for-for thirty
days
   do you mean said i  that you
will turn me loose that you will help
me escape from this ship
  yes said he this benton is a
-more treacherous and dangerous vil-
lain even than i had reckoned him he
will not touch you while i am here but
once out of my sight he would slay
you and lay it to accident and i have
no reason to wish you murdered but
in fairness to myself if i let you go i
must have your promise not to give in-
formation do you promise
    i promise said i without hesita-
tion
  the next moment i felt the cords on
my wrists loosen as they parted before
the keen blade then as i rubbed my
hands and fingers to get out the stiffness
that was necessarily there even despite
the kindly binding this strange man
sat beside me and i noted with surprise
that he wfas fraying the cut ends of the
cord with his knife as he talked  the
shore is no more than a half mile
away said he you can swim that
distance can you not
    five miles an it were necessary
said i
   good he nodded  now do you
yourself untie the other cords with
your fingers they will think then that
you frayed this in twain against the
sharp edge of this chests forced lock
and so untied the others and escaped
unaided
   beyond that door there and he
indicated the small door in the end of
the cabin  is a storeroom in the very
stern of the vessel by opening the
shuttered casement there you will be
able to lower yourself into the river
and so swim ashore
   and now i must be getting back
on deck to establish my innocence in
the affair and also to see that benton
does not skulk aft here inopportunely
remember your promise
  he had gone before i even found
words to thank him so believing my
best thanks would be shown by getting
away as quickly as possible before any
one should come to interfere with his
well-planned scheme i fell to work
so zealously on the remaining knots
that soon i had freed myself altogether
  then leaving the cords lying i
opened the small end door which was
well up in the side of the cabin and
scarcely wider than my shoulders and
squeezed myself into the compartment
beyond
  it was as black as pitch there save
for the small square of the door and
as stuffy as a closed oven smell and
touch told me that this was the food
storeroom as wrell as the container for
sail cloth and other articles of ships
usage that required careful storage
then i managed to find the tight-
barred casement in the stern and after
some little difficulty to get it open
  immediately below me almost
creaked and swung the great rudder
with the water gurgling and swishing
past overhead the feeble morning
stars still shone and off toward a light-
ening patch of sky that betokened the
coming dawn i thought i could see
the golden traitor

the low irregular outlines of trees and
hills
  it was not morning vet and less than
a dozen hours since i first provoked
benton in the tavern and shortly after-
ward engaged in that fight that had re-
sulted in my ride through the night
with that strangely interesting girl-
  i drew back within the storeroom
that half of my body that was already
dangling out of the casement she was
there-in that side cabin she was that
other  booty  bully benton had ac-
cused barbary of hiding away from
them
  and i who had writhed in my bonds
as i wondered and planned how i
might aid her if i could find her had
just given my sacred promise that
would stop me from the first move to-
ward bringing assistance in pursuit 
  as quickly as i had crept toward the
casement i now crept back from it to-
ward the small door into the cabin if
she could swim even moderately well
the two of us could gain shore as easily
as one if she could not swim-well
there surely must be a loose plank or
board somewhere at hand or even the
chests might do at a pinch
  but before i had thrust a leg out
through the small square door the noise
of footsteps and the opening of the for-
ward-cabin door made me hastily draw
back into the full shadows of the store-
rooms interior some one was enter-
ing the cabin from the deck forward
swiftly and silently i closed and latched
the storeroom door behind which i
lurked
  i could not see into the cabin yet i
dared not open the door the slightest
crack lest its ajar condition be noticed
then off to one side of the storeroom
in the darkness i noticed a small beam
of light as though the candlelight in the
main cabin stole through a hole in the
partition there
  even so i found it behind a great
heap of sail canvas i found a knothole
the size of my thumb just even with
the top of the canvas crouching amid
the canvas i placed my eye to the open-
ing
  i had thought the newcomer might
be the murderous benton skulking back
to wreak his vengeance on me or else to
pry within that closed side-cabin and
i felt about for something to use for
a weapon if he noticed my escape and
suspected my hiding place but it was
not benton after all it was the silent
sad man matteson
now he was as silent as ever and
even more mysterious inside the
cabin door he stood for several
minutes motionless merely looking
about him and listening then care-
fully he stole to each side-cabin door
and listened again particularly long
he listened at the door i knew to be
bentons and after that he turned ear
toward the outer door again
  then as if satisfied he swept up a
candle from the table into his hands and
came striding swiftly toward the shad-
owy corner where i had lain tied
  king he called softly king
andrew king
  with my heart beating in my throat i
crouched not two feet away from him
holding my breath lest he hear it as he
stood just on the other side of the thin
partition
   andrew king  he called softly
again andrew king
  then suddenly i saw him stoop saw
what it was he picked up off the floor
it was one of the frayed cords that had
bound my wrists for a long minute
he stared at it his face expressionless
then replacing it carefully where he
had found it he rose upright and a mo-
ment later i could hear his footsteps
softly retreating
  i was tense with waiting to hear him
throw open the outer door and give the
alarm of my escape yet a moment
later i heard a bench scrape on the cab-
in floor and then he came into my range
of vision seated at the table
  and in his face was nothing that i
could read as either surprise or fear or

argosy-allstory weekly
anger that i had escaped there was
nothing there at all to be read save the
old hopeless look that i knew so well
  for a half hour an hour i waited
for him to rise and be gone but he did
not move so i sat i felt the strain be-
ginning to tell on me i drooped for-
ward trying to find an easier posture
among the canvas folds wherein i
crouched and before i was even
aware of the temptation i must have
fallen asleep
chapter vii
benton rants
when i awoke again it was with
loud cries and the stamp of hur-
rying feet ringing in my ears
then from beyond the partition wall
against which i leaned came a renewal
of the clamor and pressing my eye
again to the knothole i peered into the
cabin
  the candles no longer flickered in
wall lantern or candlestick but suf-
ficient light to make things clear in the
cabin came streaming through small
grated openings in the cabin ceiling evi-
dentlj cut for that particular purpose
  and in the daylit cabin beneath ben-
ton slovenly unwashed was stamping
violently up and down snarling blas-
phemies at every step barbary was
standing just inside the passageway to
the deck having evidently just entered
and he was yawning with fatigue and
sleepiness evidence of a long night
spent on deck matteson was nowhere
in sight
   gone gone i tell you hes gone
roared benton repeating the words that
were yet ringing in my sleep-drugged
mind  hes got away and gone
   whos gone  inquired barbary
yawning as he finished  whos got
away and gone matteson
  no the forest fellow howled
benton  the fellow you wouldnt let
me put an end to last night and now
hes slipped away and ashore and hell
have ships and soldiers after us by the
hundreds
  fiddlesticks retorted barbary
 where could he have escaped to
along here except into the woods
with the start we have well be far and
away to sea before he can reach settle-
ments and fetch ships and soldiers to
lay us by the heels
  nevertheless benton in his violent
passion was not ready to listen to rea-
son  if you hadnt interfered id ha
finished him last night and have had
done with the danger altogether he
cried turning on barbary furiously
 i would not put it beyond you to have
had a hand in his going ignoring
him barbary came across the cabin to
my corner and picking up the bits of
cord there examined them lazily then
he pitched them onto the table before
the raging benton  there look for
yourself said he  is that a clean-cut
cord or a frayed one
   dont be a fool benton any one
with half an eye could-see what hap-
pened the fellow sawed his wrist
cords loose against the broken padlock
of this chest here untied his feet and
then slipped out on deck and overboard
before daylight and no one to see him
but what difference does it make since
he cant bring ships to stop us before
we are safe and away
   difference howled the raging sea
captain  why he dared me to my
face the jackanapes and then slashed
me in the arm is a chit of a woods-
loper to do that to bully benton and
get clear away unscotched 
  barbary however merely shrugged
his shoulders  catch him then if you
can said he if you can lay hands
on him i promise you this time i wont
interfere with whatever reckoning you
can bring him to-though if it were
myself that had been knifed once i
would be very wary of the same knife
a second time
  with his pistol in hand however the
hulking sea captain was searching
about looking for any signs that might
the golden traitor

indicate where a prisoner might have
passed my heart thumped as i heard
his fingers clawing at the latch on the
square door into my storeroom and
again i felt frantically around for any
weapon whatsoever to defend myself
with
  then to my amazement i saw what
i had not before noticed the store-
room casement behind me no longer
yawned open as when i had last seen
it it was closed and tightly for not
even a trickle of daylight came glinting
around the shutter edge while i slept
barbary must have crept in to close the
casement after me and so destroy the
evidence of my escape i was trapped
weaponless inside the narrow store-
room
  all i could do was try to conceal my-
self jerking the canvas over me i lay
breathless as benton puffed and panted
at the storeroom door however the
door had been built for ordinary men
and not for one of his huge shoulders
and girth moreover his heavy eating
and drinking had not left him in condi-
tion to wriggle and twist as was nec-
essary for easy entrance
  and while he still panted and cursed
i heard barbarys easy voice saying
 tush you but sweat yourself man
no one would be fool enough to hide
aboard here when he had the whole
river and woods to escape to more-
over how would he have known of the
casement inside there and it is not
left open anyway is it
   no but it would have been as
easy to close it behind him as it would
have been to help him through it in the
first place snarled benton suspicious-
ly yet to my infinite relief drawing
back into the cabin again  i dont
trust either you or that pasty-faced
matteson theres queer goings-on
here that im being kept in the dark o
but i tell you plain if i but lay hands
to that forest-loper anywhere again ill
stop his loping for good and all
   hunt for him then if nothing else
will satisfy you replied barbary
 here comes matteson you might
ask him if he has seen aught of your
forest fellow anywhere
by twisting my eye at the hole then
i saw matteson just entering the
cabin from the passage door he
was fresh-shaved and immaculate with
that unconscious air of elegance about
him that i had noted in the tavern yet
his manner was still that of one who
finds life little worth the living
  for a second matteson stood som-
ber uninterested then the fury of the
captains anger must have penetrated
even his dull consciousness he looked
about with a faint wonder  what is
the matter he questioned has
aught happened
  benton answered  has aught hap-
pened he bellowed this forest-
loping prisoner of barbarys has gained
free and by now is rousing the whole
government forces land and sea to
waylay us before we can work clear
of the river mouth
  matteson glanced quickly at barbary
but barbary only smiled  tush
said he  where else could he find
ships and soldiers nearer than phila-
delphia and by that time well be
safe out at sea and the whole wide
world to lose ourselves in friend ben-
ton here takes the matter hardly be-
cause of some little reckoning he would
have with the fellow over a knife slash
i believe
  the lightness of barbarys mood
seemed to infuriate benton still fur-
ther  shin-bones o satan he cried
 but ill be hey-diddlecl no longer
before we go a fathom farther well
see to a full settlement o shares in the
booty and not only whats in the
chests but whatever else is hidden away
in barbarys cabin there
  barbary only laughed but for the
first time matteson seemed to take a
real interest in things  whats that 
he demanded  whats this about
something hidden in barbarys
cabin

argosy-allstory weekly
   aye well may you ask snarled
benton he turned leering on bar-
bary  oh youre the smart one
arent ou sneaking aboard ship ahead
o us but you forgot that though the
ship may be yours the men are mine
when you acted so queer last night i
went forward to find out why and
what i want to know now is what else
have you got hid away in your cabin
besides a woman prisoner
  in truth the man matteson seemed
awake now at last he turned sharp
questioning eyes on babary  wrhats
this he said  you brought a wom-
an prisoner aboard you broke the
agreement that naught ashore was to be
meddled with save the chests in the
wagons of the escort
   i meddled with naught that did not
meddle with me retorted barbary
sturdily  but i did catch and fetch
along a pest of a woman that did come
rushing along the road straight toward
philadelphia crying like mad for the
soldiers and that there was treason
afoot aye and if i had not fetched
her along she would have had half the
city after us before now
   a fancy excuse sneered benton
 but i wager ye would not ha troubled
greatly to fetch her along had she not
been young and pretty blast me if i
ever knew an expedition yet that
couldnt split itself to pieces over a
woman
   what i say is that we ought to
get rid of her right away before she
gets away too like that forest fellow
or maybe screams her head off when
just were sneaking past a frigate some-
time
   get rid of her queried barbary
 and what is your idea of the best way
to get rid of her 
  benton laughed brutally theres
plenty o deep and wide places in the
river here he said let her swim
ashore if she can
  barbarys hand dropped to his pistol
butt but matteson paid no heed to
benton his gaze was all for barbary
 you have a woman prisoner aboard
here-seized and held against her
will he asked
   aye responded barbary firmly
 and by the gods i shall keep her
so a prettier maid i never saw
beauty youth spirit-she has them
all i have already a determined mind
to wed her and heaven help the man
aboard this ship that gives her not the
same respect i give her myself
mattesons hand that had been on
his own pistol butt dropped to his side
for a moment he seemed to ponder
then  captain barbary said he  i
have been a man of my word i
promised you a fortune for the trying
and i leave it to you whether i did not
fulfill my promise
   now in return i ask you one favor
will you exchange this prisoner for
my whole share in the gains of this ex-
pedition for a second even bar-
bary self-controlled as he usually was
gaped in amazement as for benton
he seemed fairly dazed
    what inquired barbary  youd
give me your full share in the money
in exchange for a woman youve never
even seen 
   it matters not whether ive seen
her or no replied matteson quietly
all that matters is that she is a wom-
an and held aboard here against her
will you heard my offer will you
accept 
  for a moment barbary continued to
stare then suddenly he brought down
one fist resoundingly against the palm
of his other hand  by the gods he
cried but i salute you as a gentle-
man  to exchange a fortune for a lady
face unseen aye it takes a gentleman
and a man of spirit to do that
   i fear me i can no longer lay claim
to being a gentleman responded mat-
teson somberly  but i will be glad
to strike the bargain with vou if you
will
  barbary seemed still befuddled at
the proposal  a fortune a sure
fortune for a chit with a pretty face
                         	a
the golden traitor

 he repeated then all at once his eyes
 ceased staring and his face tensedas
 with a sudden resolution  no by the
 saints ill show you that blackbar-
 bary can be as sporting a gentleman as
 any man you offer a fortune for a
 pretty girl i refuse a fortune for a
 pretty girl
   you will not exchange with me
asked matteson as if in bewilderment
    no returned barbary putting his
 chest out  i will keep her to remind
 me what a fool even an old pirate may
 be by the gods whatever else old
 pokey-nose may say he can never
 complain that his daughter lacked for
 proper valuation by her suitors
   he laughed and then suddenlv in
the midst of his laughter the guffaw
stopped as short as though it had been
chopped off with a knife with my
straining eyes i could see barbary star-
ing-staring at matteson as if he were
seeing a ghost and benton was star-
ing likewise
   mattesons face was white no sheet
 could have been whiter than it from
 his stock clear to his pallid temples
 but his eyes were blazing until no flash
 of lightning in the heavens could have
 been more fiery
    not his daughter not his daugh-
 ter he cried in a choked voice  ob-
 it was not her you brought aboard
 here 
    for a certainty it was her said
 the staring barbary  i forget the
 name-henrietta or some such i be-
 lieve-but it was pokey-noses girl
 for a certainty though what she was
 doing masquerading in boys clothes is
 more than i can say
   but if he had cause to gape before
 he had cause more than ever now mat-
 tesons eyes had become gleaming slits
 his lips were so tightly drawn that the
 teeth showed through and the big vein
 of his forehead bulged in a purplish
 cord
    captain barbary i have made you
 a fair proposition and you have refused
 it he said metallicly now i make
     	a
 it to you again you will either accept
 my offer of exchange for her-or you
 will fight me for her here and now
 and i warn you that i will kill you as
 surely as i stand here
chapter viii
a duel for a lady
t was benton who made the first
sound to break the stillness after
that surprising challenge of matte-
sons he laughed a loud sarcastic
guffaw barbary was silent as if
amazement had stolen his tongue
  ha-ha roared benton  strike
 me dead if your little genteel friend
 isnt calling you to account barbary
 barbary could only stutter his reply
  fight you-for her he gasped
    aye fight or exchange snapped
 matteson
    by the lord but youre a spitfire -
 matteson pity it is that i didnt have
 a few like you among my brethren of
 the caribees more than one cubano
 that got away safe would have gulped
 water instead
   the uproarious benton was all the
 while deriding barbarys seeming hesi-
 tation
  why dont you accept his chal-
lenge  barbary he guffawed
  youve always claimed to have been a
 gentleman yourself before you took the
 sea a-pirating heres your chance now
 to prove it
   by then barbary seemed to have re-
 covered his poise lie turned on the
 hulking captain with words not lack-
 ing in fire  have done with you
 lie cried  it was never said of black
 barbary that he was afraid to meet
 any man in fair fight i shall mourn
 you as a true-spirited gentleman mat-
 teson 
   you had best wait till the things
 finished before you do any mourning
 returned matteson with the most as-
 perity he had shown yet  which shall
 it be sir-swords or pistols

argosy-allstory weekly
   make it pistols and across the
table suggested benton before bar-
bary could answer and he threw the
two pistols he carried in his waistband
onto the table  here you are gentle-
men already loaded
  did i not bid you keep out o
this snapped barbary and then to
matteson  no ill leave the choice to
vou-and egad youre going to need
it
  matteson glanced at the weapons on
the table  you are the challenged
party the choice is yours he insisted
 and i warn you that in the city i am
rated well as a fencer to make it
more even you had best choose the
pistols
   nay swords it is then cried bar-
bary gayly  only not small swords
but good stout blades such as-good sea-
men love and though you may be
well rated with the small sword of the
fencing schools youll find the blade
they use at sea quite a different sort of
tool i warrant you
   benton hand us down those cut-
lasses from over the arms rack there
  so it was that i from my hiding
place in the storeroom squinted
through a knothole at such sight as few
men of the western settlements ever
gazed on when the table and benches
were pushed back barbary and matte-
son took their stands facing each other
in the cleared space cutlass in hand
while from the side the gross benton
looked on pistol in hand and made a
great burlesque of conducting the duel
in the fashion of the day
   it was at his suggestion that the pis-
tols of the two duelists had been laid
together on the table at the side and
the fighters had stripped themselves of
coat and waistcoat
  as they stood facing each other thus
i had to shiver at the disparity between
the two men barbary was a full half
foot taller than matteson and his great
shoulders bulged with shirt while his
fingers swung the heavy cutlass at
arms-length like a mere wheat straw
  yet in mattesons easy almost in-
dolent posture and in the smoothness
of his movements there was something
too that caught and held the eye and
though his arms and body looked
amazingly slender the weight of the
heavy cutlass seemed no handicap
   the gross sea captain waved his pis-
tol muzzle commandingly  are you
ready gentlemen he grinned  then
stand to your guard one-two-
three heavy blows gentlemen
  the cabin rang with the clash and
clang of steel meeting steel
   for the first few minutes of the fight
it seemed that sheer strength and
weight must overwhelm speed and
agility barbarys blows fell like great
hammers till it seemed impossible that
anything could stand before them
   sparks flew from the clashing blades
and ever it seemed that the smaller man
escaped destruction only by the slen-
derest margin lucky it was that the
high poop deck above had been raised
much more than the poops of any of
the little cargo vessels i had seen at
new orleans else barbary had never
found room to swing as he did
  then i saw that matteson was not
trying to check the terrific blows direct-
ly but with agile blade was canting
them off to one side or the other so that
the very force of the strokes helped to
swerve them aside yet not all the
blows could be so deftly turned and
twice i saw barbarys blade tug at mat-
tcsons shirt and after it the red
smudge of flowing blood
  in his dodging too matteson was
being pressed steadily back ever back
toward the cabin corner behind him
and benton squealed in bloodthirsty
eagerness youve got him barbary
coop him in the corner where he cant
run
  but matteson seemed to take warn-
ing from the cry and just in time he
stopped short and for the first time in
the fight made a sudden thrust at
barbary
   the thrust did not land but the puff-
the golden traitor

ing barbary had all he could do to
avoid that licking blade then i be-
came aware for the first time how
violently barbary had been exerting
himself his face was beaded with
perspiration his breath came short and
fast through his open lips and again
matteson thrust and this time it was
barbary who gave back as he parried
  differently from the giant barbary
matteson never once made a slashing
stroke always it was the thrust the
darting point now here now there
drawing barbarys parrying weapon to
one place merely to stab out at another
part of his huge body
  not once did matteson give barbary
time to set himself to gather himself
for another of those terrific strokes of
the earlier moments time after time
barbary had to leap back to save him-
self from a darting thrust and his
earlier exertions had made him no
faster on his feet
  almost before any of us realized
barbarys back was against the side of
the cabin almost alongside benton who
had to leap to get clear of the flying
steel and for the first time a faint
smile seemed to curl at the corners of
mattesons lips
   you have had your fun barbary
said he now i shall have mine i
have a fancy for that uppermost button
on your shirt watch it carefully if
you would not lose it
  and then clang-before barbary
could guard himself even had he been
able mattesons blade shot out deftly
swept barbarys blade aside and
tugged at the shirt beyond the button
did not come away but both benton
and i saw the tiny rip just beneath
where the licking point had torn the
cloth
   not high enough that said mat-
teson coolly  perhaps there will be
better luck this time
  again that clash of blades and
twitching of cloth and the rent this
time wasabove the button
to be conclud
  benton knew i knew-barbary
knew-that matteson was but playing
with him skill such as he had was
not to be opposed by all the strength in
the world
   and then matteson for a second
held his busy blade yet kept it pointing
like a finger of death at barbarys pant-
ing breast  the next time said he
slowly  i shall not stop with the but-
ton it will be the heart beneath-or
will you trade the girl to me now 
   barbary had not breath to make im-
 mediate answer his lips moved word-
 lessly his eyes glared and then all at
 once he found his breath ill
 trade he cried
    then drop your point said mat-
 teson drop your point or else
 ill-
   he got no further in the very
midst of his sentence his eyes seemed
suddenly to start from his head his
sword arm flew up driving the blade
an inch into the wood before it rang
clattering from his loosened fingers
   his knees crumpled under him even
 as i heard the thud of the treacherous
 blow and then beyond over his
 sprawling body i saw the grinning
 benton the pistol with whose heavy
 butt he had struck still uplifted in his
 hand
   his face was fiendish with treachery
 and cunning  i saved ye barbary
 he cried  another second and hed
 ha pinked you through the wizend for
 a certainty
   his beady eyes were fixed like a fer-
 rets on barbarys cutlass whose point
 was still thrust out defensively at breast
 height already that point in its
 wielders surprise was drooping away
 from guard position
   before i could even shout the warn-
 ing at what i saw in bentons feverish
 eyes bcrbarys cutlass point had sunk
 to knee height and then as coolly as
 if he were butchering hogs full into
 the breast of barbary benton fired his
 pistol

the duchess and the fight
racket
by thomas b thomson 
et me introduce myself folks

nel to my left ear and dives for the

dressing miss allison comes back a
dignified throaty voice ten degrees

i calls after her sort o nasty i dont
like the way her face lights up when
she talks about him honest as i
watch her coastin along in the wake
o the duchess her slim body sort o
swingin athletic like her curly boy-
bob held up pert and independent i
   gets sentimental all over theres one
   dame i could place among my souve-
   nirs
     i collects ronnies luggage and wes
   ready to depart this ronnie dont
   look just the way id him pictured
   lie ain t big not that but he carries
   hisself sort o competent and easylike
   but when i thinks how he heldonto
   the secretarys hand when he met her
   i decides he needs disciplinin-bad
   i ve no claims there but im hopin
  we puts from there me in front
        drivin and the three o them
        settinin behind a little flurry
   	rain blows up after awhile and the
   wind whips it in all over me and when
   	thinks o that sister settin back in
   there all comfortable talkin to miss
   katherine i gets mad
     then i reflects about my tough luck
   et cetera and i gets still madder and
   i turns a corner and a guy what should
   be herdin sheep sideswipes me with
   his cheap tin-can it dont damage
   him none to speak of cause whats a
   fender worth on a wreck like that
    i gets out and tells him what i
 thinks and he comes back with a lot
 o hooey about me turnin the corners
 too fast i tells him how many kinds
 of a cock-eyed prevaricator he is and
 he arms hisself with a tire-iron i for-
 gets theys frails present and gets ready
 to bust him one when theys a inter-
 ruption from the prodigal son
   cut that out he yipps  you
 should know better than to turn cor-
 ners at such speed on wet streets
   i almost faints when he motions for
 me to get back in the bus he goes
 over to the guy whos still wavin the
 tire-iron and actin savage
     rhis is the delancey car ronnie
 says  im sorry we damaged your
 machine if youll have the fender
 replaced and bring me the bill your
 money will be refunded
    dont you do nothin o the kind 
 i yells its all his fault hes the
 one run into us
the duchess and the fight racket

   hes entitled to his half of the
road ronnie comes back
   not when he takes it out o the
center i snibs
   when i wish your advice ill in-
form you ronnie says sharp and i
shuts up
  i drives home sore ive kissed my
job good-by me bein in that accident
and all i dont like that guy
  when i puts up the car i waits my
chance and pretty soon ronnie boy
comes out and i calls him to come
see where the paints scraped off the
fender honest i almost laughs at
him walkin in there to get hisself a
good shellackin i closes the door soft
and comes over to where hes standin
   it will need touching up a bit
he says
  so will you you big palooka i
comes back  soons i get through

it
  yea funnyface i chirps i
dont like your shape nor your mug
nor nothin and since im to get the
gate and all because o you ill just
leave you a little remembrance o bill
hawkins one o the best little prelim
boys that ever drawed on a glove
  he looks at me with new interest
   oh he says again  so youve
had ring experience in that case-i
think ill give you the chance to work
me over-if you can
   he strips off his coat and silk shirt
and when i lamps the set o his shoul-
ders and the muscles playin around un-
der his skin i wonders what ive let
myself in for then i laughs at myself
and thinks this pink-tea sisters gettin
my goat
    all right he says final  im as
ready for my lickin as ill ever be
  that strikes me as funny and im
chucklin over it as i measures him for
the first little jolt i dont intend to

plans to tap him a few dozen times
around the face red him all up and get

torney no less than eight times and

  eight bells and still no word from
the dowager miss allison is ready
to faint on a minutes notice and i
aint much better
   listen bill she says final
 somebody must be there or peep will
worry hell be watching those seats
and you must be there to explain if
she comes in ill use your hospital idea
-the one i laughed at afterward if
she tries to leave ill sit on her
  she means it too i hands her two
o the pasteboards and sprints for a
south-bound car
  honest i never see cars run so slow
stops and delays o every description
-im ready to bite the ear off a traffic
cop by the time we reaches the stadium
almost nine i elbows my way in
and breathes a sigh o relief two
tough prelim boys is whangin each
other with everything they got
  i reaches my seat and begins to think
what will i tell peep im composin
my little say and dead to all else when
i hears some one over to my right and
it gradually sinks in that ive heard
that voice before
   my good man says the voice
 im sure youre mistaken the tickets
i procured from one of your ah
speculators was much further back than
this
  take what you get lady and be
happy pipes the bozo whats doin the
usherin  these is what yer tickets
calls for
  i wonders am i dreamin its the
duchess some flustered about the
seats but the cutie is shooin her right
along
   its all right she says  the
doorman and usher wouldnt both
make the same mistake
  she chevies the old girl in and when
the duchess sees me she just says shes
surprised and i agrees that its mutual
shes nobodys fool she knows shes
been jobbed but how and thats
exactly what i wants to know miss
katherines over on the other side and
when i looks at her with a thousand
the duchess and the fight racket	
questions in my eyes she just laughs
and when the duchess aint lookin
throws me a kiss honest that damed
drive mr volstead to home brew
  the duchess dont ask no questions
a-tall and pretty soon the preliminary
ends in a draw and the rings cleared
for the main attraction
   the next bout will be between
gunner sullivan and peep oday
sings out a leather-lunged bozo from
the ring  for the right to meet the
middle-weight title-holder
   this peep oday pipes the
duchess  do you know him 
   do i i chirps  do i wait
till you lamps him maam
   peep-peep oday the duchess
muses  that sounds so unusual-is
it his real name
    i cant rightfully say maam i
stutters  some fighters uses their
own names and some dont
   she says for me to point him out as
soon as he comes in i agrees but i
dont think itll be necessary im
wonderin wholl enter the ring first
peep probably the gunnerd wait
till the crack o doom but hed make
the other guy cool his heels out front
while the crowd looked him over and
give him the razz all of a sudden
from up back o us all the yellin and
whistlin and feet-stompin you ever
heard breaks loose and i know peeps
on his way
    thats peep cornin now i sajs
she jumps up to get a slant at him
everybody else is doin the same in-
cludin miss katherine which is not
surprisin but the duchess think o
her troublin to glimpse a prize fighter
who for all she knows shes never
even saw before its got me stopped
  on account o everybody bein up
we cant see the hero none whatsoever
the duchess stretches her neck in
every direction but it aint no use and
finally she climbs on to a chair
   can you see him miss katherine
asks 
  the duchess nods and climbs down
and her face somehow looks dis-
appointed
    hes a perfect stranger she re-
marks  im sure i never saw him
before
  me and cutie exchange glances is
the old girl goin to make out hes a
stranger-and keep it up  she might
shes that way
  then he climbs through the ropes-
and it aint peep a-tall its the gunner
he bows in all directions and shakes
his own hands and everybody yells
theirselves black in the face thevre
strong for him well hes a good
willin fighter and thats what takes
with a fight crowd
then the yellin starts on the far
side o the stadium and this
time its got to be peep but the
crowds so thick i cant see him till he
climbs through the ropes and looks
right at where were parked he
knows what hes lookin for all right
and how his face lights up
   but mrs delanceys map is a study
she gets halfway up and stands there
for a minute just starin at him then
she settles back slow like the seat
might dissolve and let her down and
all the time shes lookin holes right
through him but she never makes a
single yipp soon she looks around at
her secretary then at me then back
at miss katherine again
   miss allison she says and her
voice sure sounds funny   will you
please explain how you managed these
ringside seats
   peep got them for us cutie an-
swers never battin a eye
   why didnt you tell me you had
them then it wouldnt have been
necessary for me to spend the day chas-
ing a speculator all over the city for
the privilege of paying an exorbitant
price for those other seats
  so that was why we couldnt locate
her mrs poindexter delancey put-
tin a whole day huntin tickets to a
prize fight but why theres some

argosy-allstory weekly
things about it i dont understand so
well
  the battles about ready to start and
i turns to sizin up the fighters the
gunners all there make no mistake
about that hes bigger and strongern
ever and he handles hisself sort o
free and easy like all his grease cups
is filled fresh and everythings workin
smooth-you know
  but when i looks at peep i cheers
up hes not so heavy but hes taller
his hair is cut short and hes clean-
shaved which is too bad whiskers
makes good sandpaper in the clinches
peep looks so clean and fit he almost
throws oft sparks his reach aint so
jong as the gunners but im bettin
he can snap em across lots quicker
hell not land so hard but oftener
and that might spell victory
  its time to go and peep shoots us
a look that would melt reenforced con-
crete miss katherine and me we give
him the big salute but the duchess just
watches him with lips set
   b-o-n-g its the bell and theyre off
we gets a slant on their diffenent styles
right away the gunner tries to tear
peeps head off with the first punch
but peep aint asleep his head rolls
back and the punch lands as hes goin
away it slaps loud but dont do no
damage peep lands on the gunners
nose and dances out o reach grinnin
with the gunner ploddin after him
  and thats the way they go-peep
tappin and dancin away and the gun-
ner flat-footin after him trvin to land
a real one the round ends with peep
ahead easy
  the one-minute rests over and the
second round aint much different from
the first-the gunner borin in and
peep back-pedalin and ever so often
slammin the gunner where itll do the
most good but the gunner sheds wal-
lops like a duck does rain and trudges
in for more im worried hes sure
to get peep in a corner before long
and then itll be loo bad i know how
that baby can sock
  a big fat bozo right behind us one
o them lollops with a yard o chins and
a bullfrog bellow must have the whole
bank roll on the gunner hes pannin
peep for not stoppin long enough to
get hit and beggin the gunner to kill
the  yellow-livered kyoodle he
breathes most o these tender wishes
down the duchesss neck in a fog-horn
blat that can be heard outside the san
pedro breakwater and i measures him
up for a wallop if she orders it
  five rounds is gone forever and i
breathes easier peep is fresh and way
out in front on points only once has
it looked bad the gunner corners
him in the fourth and starts slammin
and his dukes is sinkin out o sight in
peeps body i jumps up wonderin
if peeps goin to get away everybody
else is up too yellin for a knockout
but peep rips in a bird of a uppercut
follows it with two hooks to the body
and slips out o danger
  i slumps back and glances at the
duchess her face has lost its wooden
look like her mask has fell off and i
grins  f peep makes a fight of it shell
be his manager from now on but if
he keeps on runnin away and finally
gets knocked kickin shell likely finish
him with a meat ax shes that way
  after seven rounds the fans has give
up theyre tired beggin peep to fight
and the things they call him-oh boy
and all this time the duchesss face has
got whiter and whiter and her moyth
has closed up tighter and tighter im
a little disgusted with peep myself it
aint that he cant fight ive mixed
with him i know
i see the gunners handlers is grow-
in desperate theyre tellin him to
bust peep or hes sunk but hes
tired hes slowed up almost to a crawl
and his arms is so heavy he cant hard-
ly lift em im figurin this fights as
good as settled barrin a lucky punch
when the bell rings and-blooey out
comes the gunner and proceeds to climb
all over peep
the duchess and the fight racket

  he slides under peeps chin and
pumps em in with both hands good
night how that baby can sock peeps
in distress he cant break away he
tries to clinch but cant-all he can do
is stop em
  the gang is up again yellin for the
finish suddenly the gunner slips
back and starts one from his shoe laces
wow it sounds like somebody has
smashed the roof in and peep goes
down with his feet trailin i gives a
groan its all over but the funeral
i thinks the gunners standin back
and actin proud over a good work-
manlike job
  the referee counts to five and peep
never stirs at seven he rolls over and
raises his - head like hes wonderin
what its all about at eight he seems
to hear for the first time hes awake
all right but can he get up at nine
he pulls a leg under him and makes it
to a upright he tries to wabble away
but the gunner is all over him
  peep goes down again but this time
he struggles to a knee at the count o
five and stays there restin and wipin
the fog away hes on his feet at nine
and staggers into a lucky clinch when
the referee breaks em hes on a bi-
cycle and stays there for the rest o
the round
  whew thats over with i swal-
lows my heart back and looks around
at the rest o the family miss kather-
ine has both hands clenched and two
tears is plowin down her cheeks if
ever a girl suffered shes doin it now
  the duchess is takin it different
her jaw is clamped hard and i can
imagine how a she-grizzlyd look if she
caught some one maulin one o her
cubs but the dowagers not lookin at
peep shes gazin at the gunner most-
ly just then the fat mess behind her
breaks out again
  youre gettin him gunner he
screeches  hes out on his feet right
now youll kill him the next round
  the duchess whirls around and
hands the fat stiff a dirty look
   you dont know what youre talk-
ing about she snaps at him any
one can see that your gunner is the
one who is about to collapse and ill
thank you to stop breathing down my
neck
   no harm lady no harm done the
fatty stutters hes took clean off his
base shes that way
 looks at the gunner and hanged
if she aint right hes clean dis-
couraged peep comes out for the
ninth still a little groggy but confident
dan heenan his handler has shot
something into him that they dont get
out o no needle-gun old dans man-
aged fighters for years and knows his
business
  they meet in the middle o the ring
and peep dont run from the gunner
none a-tall he sends a straight left to
the jaw that turns the gunner halfway
around and clips him a right-handed
beauty before the gunner knows hes
within reach then he pokes another
left through the gunners guard and
leans it against his nose-hard
  the gunners so surprised he almost
backs up then he comes right back
swingin his weary arms and tryin
hard to finish his little chore as in-
structed honest he cant hardly lift
his gloves no more
   i looks to see peep step in and finish
him but does he do it no sir he
climbs back on his bicycle and the old
game o tag me im a butterfly is on
again gosh its enough to make you
sick then i gets a jolt
   get in there and fight somebody
screeches in my ear and i turns won-
derin whos gone crazy its the
duchess shes standin up swingin
her fists and leanin forward  ron-
nie do you hear me  get in and fight
she shrieks
  ronnie hears her so does every-
body else within five blocks he stops
like hes been shot and turns gazin at
the mater-the mater thats a
laugh-with his mouth open and

  p d q makes some friends-and enemies who
  specialize in shots from the dark
 by george m johnson
   author of squatters rights tickets to paradise etc
   leading up to this installment
peter dg quincy is a rambling
cowboy who rides into the town
of cactus springs and finds it
being run by a sort of unofficial boss
named spofford whose occupation is
that of banker
  in the red front saloon pete is
happy to discover an old friend aleck
carmichael tending bar while they
are still rejoicing over seeing each
other after a long time peter de
ouincy has his first altercation with one
of the spofford family
  spofford jr the bankers son hap-
pens to be annoying a brand-new young
dance hall girl while pete is looking
pete knocks him down and then mex-
ican charlie and carl davis two of
banker spoffords strong-arm men rush
in right then de quincy gives an
exhibition of the quickness which has
gained him the nickname of p d o
  pete throws a chair at mexican
charlie and knocks him out leaps at
carl davis hitting and knocking him
out with one solar plexus punch  then
he gets the girl out of the dance hall
and sees her safely on to the early
morning train which will take her to
her home
this story began in the argosy-allstory weekly for september 
s

argosy-allstory weekly
   as a result of that altercation spof-
ford jr offers charlie and davis one
thousand dollars each to kill pete in
view of p d os speed the two
bruisers take their time in considering
the offer
  meanwhile banker spofford is up to
some deviltry of his own  on an inside
tip that a syndicate is planning an ir-
rigation dam and lake on the three star
dot ranch spofford sr determines to
swindle beautiful young peggy win-
some and her boy brother newt out of
the property so that he can make a big
profit by selling the ranch to the irriga-
tion syndicate after he has wrongfully
obtained it
  banker spoffords method of steal-
ing the ranch is to be the following
lie holds a mortgage with a cutthroat
foreclosure clause on the three star
dot  he sends carl davis out to hold
up peggy and her brother when they
will come to make the interest pay-
ment so that it will be defaulted
  peggy sprains her ankle on interest
day and young newt rides toward
town alone with the money when
davis holds him up he gets only a bag-
ful of iron washers with which the boy
has been wise enough to fill the leather
bag the family usually uses as a gold
pouch and peter de quincy happens
to meet newt on the road and protects
him the rest of the distance into town
  newt insists that he does not want
peter to accompany him when he goes
to pay banker spofford so- he goes
alone into spofford srs office lhe
shady banker writes out a receipt for
the money but manages to take it away
again from newt by a sleight-of-hand
trick
  a few days later spofford s
rides out to the three star dot and in-
sists that he never received the interest
payment on the mortgage and that he
will foreclose and take the ranch away
from peggy and newt unless they pay
back the six thousand dollars of the
mortgage within one month after the
due date of the interest
  he then goes so far as to hint to
peggy that he will let her keep the
ranch if she will marry and try to re-
form his worthless son spofford jr
at this young newt manfully opposes
him and insists that he leave the house
  however when banker spofford has
gone newt says  gee i wish pete
would come

 goid in them tiiar hiles
eb sanderson was a typical
desert rat as gaunt and gray and
weather-beaten as some ancient
granite ledge that has resisted the cease-
less attack of the elements through un-
told ages
  wind-driven sand had pecked and
scarred his leathern cheeks his eyes
faded to a watery colorless hue by the
constant glare of a blazing sun on al-
kali had acquired a peculiar sort of
squint so deeply sunken in their sockets
that you almost doubted whether or not
the old fellow really had eyes after all
  his hair was a grizzled matted mass
not over clean his fingers were skin-
ny to an astonishing degree and a man-
icurist would have emitted a piercing
shriek and fainted at one glimpse of
their nails
  the brain of the old prospector was
perhaps a little warped as is not al-
together unusual with men of his type
a life of solitude exposure and hard-
ship the endless battle with the stark
savagery of nature at her worst the
heat of a pitiless sun the awe-inspiring
grandeur of the forbidding scenes
which surround him-all these conspire
to influence the mental slant of one
who seeks fortune in arid wastes it
is always taken for granted that the
genuine desert rat is addle-pated to a
greater or less extent
  at the present eb sanderson had
abandoned the desert in favor of
apache canon where he had been in-
dustriously prospecting during the past
                           	a
trouble ranch

several years no gold to speak of
had ever been discovered in the im-
mediate district but this fact did not
deter sanderson nor dampen his faith
   gold is thar was his motto  all
a fellers got to do is find it
  the assurance of this was based on
a remarkable series of dreams which
eb had experienced now and then
at irregular intervals-once on no less
than three successive nights-a vision
had appeared before him a woman
dressed in flowing robes of white who
disclosed to his eager eyes a handful
of golden quartz and beckoned mys-
teriously eb sanderson followed her
-in his dreams-but exasperatingly
enough could not quite keep pace with
the guide
  on up apache canon she floated
looking back and beckoning encourage-
ment while poor eb fell ever farther
to the rear despite his frantic efforts
  each time the wraithlike figure dis-
appeared from view leaving sander-
son disconsolate over his failure but
firmly convinced that somewhere in
apache canon lay hidden a golden
treasure as time went on this idea
became a fixed obsession
   its a pocket like as not he mused
when pondering over these startlingly
realistic dreams  or mebbe a quartz
ledge fair rotten with the valler stuff
anyway i know the gold is thar ill
find it too you bet
  eb sanderson beneath his unattrac-
tive exterior was a very likable old
codger due allowance being made for
the little foibles and idiosyncrasies
which dominated him a stranger
might have judged him gruff taciturn
uncommunicative but once you gained
his confidence he proved to be an in-
teresting conversationalist with much
to say that was well worth hearing
  few if any friends did sanderson
possess-with the notable exception of
peggy and newt winsome he had
come to apache canon only a few
months after frank winsomes death
establishing himself in a ramshackle
  abandoned cabin some miles up from
apache gap here be lived the life
of a hermit neither desiring nor seek-
ing any contact with the outside world
peggy in the course of a morn-
ings ride happened upon the old
prospector busily panning for gold
in apache creek sanderson at first
met the girls friendly advances with
ill-concealed apprehension and even dis-
trust but his diffident suspicion was no
match for her disarming smile and the
sympathetic understanding which
lurked in her serene blue eyes
  soon there was established between
them an entente cor diale which later
broadened to include newt and the
hermit of apache canon came to be a
regular and always welcome visitor at
the three star dot ranch
  this was a fortunate circumstance
for old eb sanderson since his gold-
seeking provided pitifully little in the
way of substantial returns less in fact
than he needed for the bare necessities
of life he had secured a limited credit
in cactus springs at the start but this
was presently exhausted and things
would have indeed gone hard with eb
save for the help he received from the
winsome ranch
  peggy was not blind to the old fel-
lows destitute condition and loading
him up with supplies whenever he ap-
peared even though her own financial
prospects were black enough to be a
cause of constant worry
  a high order of diplomacy was re-
quired to carry this through for san-
derson was prouder than lucifer and
would have shrunk from the thought
of accepting charity-especially from
a woman so peggys contributions
were camouflaged under the conven-
tional grub-stake agreement whatever
mineral wealth he found was to be
shared with her fifty-fifty
peggy readily assented to this ar-
rangement though solely as a conces-
sion to uncle ebs strict sense of the
proprieties and with no idea of ever

argosy-allstory weekly
profiting thereby on a similar basis
she induced the prospector to replace
his ragged worn-out garments with
some old world clothes of her fathers
hanging unused on nails in the tool-
shed rafters
  peggy winsome was the only person
to whom eb confided the secret of his
mysterious visitor and the hopes which
centered about it
    her coming thataway proves theys
gold thar he asserted confidently one
day when they were talking about his
quest trouble is i cant travel fast
enough to foller gettin too old and
stiff in the laigs i reckon wouldnt
you think now miss peggy thet shed
slow up a mite count of a poor old
cuss thet aint what he uster be one way
an another
   indeed i would peggy declared
warmly  i dont think shes the least
bit considerate
    now thets a tolerble strong state-
ment maam shes well dispositioned
or she wouldnt be tryin to tell me
about the gold praps she cant go
slower
   have you seen her lately uncle
eb peggy asked
   no lie said  not fer nigh a
month shes due to show up again
most any time i aim to stay with her
if i can only git my laigs to workin
brisk but she sorter sails along easy
like above the stones and bresh while
i find the goin powerful tough
    maybe next time youll have better
luck peggy predicted  cant you
throw a rope around her or something
uncle eb and hold the lady back she
might take the hint
   why now thets an idee miss
peggy he chuckled  might be ill
try it
old eb sanderson was taking in-
ventory of the provisions in his
humble shack he investigated
the coffee can and found it empty bot-
tom showed in the flour container and
there was barely an inch left of what
had once been a noble slab of sow-belly
the ancient prospector shook his head
lugubriously at this damaging evidence
of famine
   corn in egypt he mused  but
daavgone little here theys plenty o
salt left an we aint no wrays short o
pepper but hells bells a body cant be
expected to struggle along on them two
condiments i might mebby kill me a
rabbit or a spruce grouse esomething
only i aint got no shells fer my gun-
 got to git some grub thets sar-
tin and theys only one place where
im sure o gettin it aint a chance
fer a grubstake in cactus springs daw-
gone the luck lord knows i hate like
sin to go moochin around miss peg-
gys place takin advantage o her kind-
ness but shucks ill be payin her
back when i make my strike
    it dont look noways proper fer me
to go clown to the three star dot with-
out any excuse them wild plums in
the canon are a-gettin ripe ill pick
a snag and take em to miss peggy
shes allowed three four times as how
wild plums air a weakness o hern
  it never occurred to simple old eb
that plums grew in abundance along
the base of the hog-back ridge within
pistol shot of the winsome ranch
where peggy and newt could obtain all
they wanted for the slight labor in-
volved in gathering them what he
wanted was an excuse for visiting his
neighbors and the plums provided it
later that same morning he
emerged from apache gap short-
	ly afterward to appear at the door
of the kitchen over which peggy pre-
sided
   mornin miss peggy he called
cheerily  i brought you a batch o
ripe plums theyre a-gettin right
sweet and tasty now
    come in uncle eb peggy called
 im awfully glad to see you then
reproachfully  its been an age since
you paid us a visit id begun to think
youd forgotten your old friends
trouble ranch

     shucks miss peggy he protest-
  ed  you oughter know bettern thet
  wherell i put these yer plums
    ill take them oh arent they
 fine lots bigger than the ones grow-
 ing around the ranch im a thousand
 times obliged to you uncle eb
    some folk claim wild plums should
 oughter be made into jam sanderson
 ventured surrendering the basket to
 peggy and some says preserve em
 whole me-i allow they hit the spot
 chawed down raw especially when the
 suns made em soft an sweet an
 juicy what do you think miss
 peggy
   why i like them all wavs she
 smiled
    well thets a safe answer eb
 grunted lowering himself into a kitch-
 en chair peggy passed him a platter
 of cookies fresh from the oven
   hows your lady friend uncle
eb she inquired had anv visits
lately
   he blinked at her mournfully be-
 tween copious mouthfuls
    thet thar scheme o yourn never
 worked at all miss peggy
   what scheme peggy demanded
mystified she had quite forgotten
their last conversation on the subject
    why throwin a rope around her
 like she was a hoss on the range-er a
 steer i dont guess she was keen about
 bein treated thetaway anyhow she
 went off actin kind o mad i aint
 seen her sence mebbe shell come
 back sanderson conceded dolefully
 an mebbe she wont women air
 peculiar you gathered that he con-
 sidered himself an authority on the
 other sex
   im sorry to have given you such
 miserable advice peggy said her voice
 registering deep contrition though she
 dearly wanted to laugh  but dont
 worry uncle eb shell come back
   you think so miss peggy
   of course wromen pretend to re-
 sent that caveman stuff but secretly
 they all like a little of it now and then
what does she look like ltncle eb
you never told me
    her face is sorter sad an dreamy
sanderson responded  but its awful
hard to describe guess thets because
she aint earthly
    i think its the most romantic thing
lever heard of peggy declared
 perhaps shes your boyhood sweet-
heart come to bring you good luck
    might be he answered with a dry
chuckle  except i never had no sweet-
heart an she aint brought me any
luck to speak of-not yit how be
things going by you miss peggy
he glanced shrewdly at peggys face
as he asked
   all right i was thinking about
you yesterday uncle eb that last
grubstake must be more than gone
the ranch larders pretty well stocked
up now and i want you to have some
of my supplies
    why now you hadnt oughter do
thet sanderson protested though fee-
bly  it aint right fer me to be grub-
bin offen you all the time howsom-
ever it aint like you was givin me
truck he added   it  all be paid
back when you git the split on thet
strike i aim to make
    why of course peggy assented
 thats all understood this is noth-
ing but a business arrangement between
us
    i wouldnt take your help no other
way sanderson maintained  as you
likely know miss peggy i aint a guy
thet would sponge offen his friends
peggy bustled around thekitchen
contributing a generous portion of
sugar flour coffee and other
staples she gave ungrudgingly and
even gladly her heart filled to over-
flowing with pity for the pathetic old
wreck cast up at her feet by the stormy
sea of life
peggy even found time to wonder
what would become of eb sanderson
after the unprincipled banker of cac-
tus springs had wound up his sorry

argosy-allstory weekly
business of taking the three star dot
ranch from newt and herself
    sure you kin spare all this plun-
der miss peggy eb asked  theys
a powerful lot o room in tliet thar
basket youre a-fillin
  not so much uncle eb peggy
insisted  im sure youll find use for
it
  eb glanced at her doubtfully in a
vague sort of way he sensed that some-
thing was wrong with peggy on the
surface she appeared her usual light-
hearted spontaneous sunny self but
uncle eb was after his fashion a can-
ny old soul and peggys attitude struck
him as being forced as if she were
laboring under a burden that she vali-
antly tried to conceal
  everything all right is it he
asked for the second time
   why of course it is uncle eb
she told him but peggys blue eyes
failed to meet his as she answered
 i baked a cake this morning and i
want you to have half of it
  sanderson made suitable acknowl-
edgment of this splendid gift adding
to himself  if she dont want to tell
me she dont have to but   find out
whats wrong just the same aloud
he innocently inquired newt to
hum	 
    hes somewhere around the place
peggy replied unsuspiciously  i know
hed be glad to see you
so uncle eb scouted about until he
located newt without delay he
came directly to the point
    whats gone wrong newt  i just
ast yer sister only she put me oft she
acts worried like
  newt was perfectly willing to pour
the tale of their difficulties into a sym-
pathetic ear
  that dad-burned crook down at
cactus springs is sure choking us
plenty were up against it peg and i
are  looks like wed lose the three
star dot   
    tell me all about it son old eb
sanderson ordered sternly  dont
leave out nothing
  so newt told him beginning with
the mortgage and continuing right on
down through the whole shabby busi-
ness
    that old shorthorns got us where
the hair is short see the boy con-
cluded  i paid him the interest money
when it was due but he switched the
papers on me when i wasnt looking
so we aint got proof that it was paid
    spofford claims i never come near
him that day and beins nobody saw
me go in his office were just out of
luck now unless peg and i dig up
six thousand three hundred before the
first of the month he puts us oft then
were through
    why the cross-eyed son of a knock-
kneed jassack uncle eb ejaculated
piously-or words to that general ef-
fect for some minutes uncle eb
dwelt luridly on banker spofford
    gee uncle eb was newts awe-
struck comment when the flow of ora-
tory at length subsided to a feeble mut-
ter you sure can sling a mean
tongue
   the desert rat looked sheepish and
somewhat ashamed of himself
    im a dodderin old fool to talk
thetaway-with you around newt
your pretty sister d scold me plenty
fer settin you this yer sort o example
some gent ought to bend a good heavy
boot on me an thets no lie
    h-m newt grunted  guess ive
heard cow-punchers swear enough
times to which he naively added
 but gee uncle eb i bet not many
riders could touch you when you get
to going youre an artist
   sanderson accepted this tribute with
befitting modesty at once coming back
to the interrupted talk
    i aint well posted on law and sech
like truck newt he confessed  but
from what ive heard tell o spofford
lies a bad actor an i bet the laws
on his side same as he states
    thats about what i think newt
trouble ranch

agreed  and peggy too we aint
got a chinamans chance bucking spof-
ford in a lawsuit hed have every-
thing fixed up beforehand because hes
got slathers of dough only way out
i can see is for us to get hold of the
cash in time to beat out spofford
   but gee uncle eb we need a lot
of luck to do that the three hundred
spofford stole off me cleaned peg out
we got to pay that over again and six
thousand to boot
  we aint got much time to work
in have we sanderson ruminated
instinctively he allied himself with his
friends in this time of need  if it
was a year from now newt things
would be different a heap i aim to
have my strike by then but that
wouldnt do you and miss peggy no
good a-tall
  you realty think youre going to
make a strike uncle eb newt asked
   think sanderson echoed  i
know it boy theys gold in them
thar hills
is very earnestness impressed
newt
 it would be a wonderful thing
for peg if you could only show speed
in this business uncle eb he sug-
gested  if youre going to make a
strike -ou better do it while peggy can
get the benefit fore its too late six
thousand dollars means a lot to her
right now
   youve sartinly got the correct
idee newt sanderson applauded
clapping newt on the back  i been
sorter putterin along lazy like takin
things easr prom now on i aim to
hipper ill have that strike fore spof-
ford gets peggys ranch its a prom-
ise newt
  bully for you uncle eb newt
cried enthusiastically  im betting on
you
   dont copper the play son was
old ebs sober advice  shes a plumb
safe bet
  thereupon he picked up the basket
of provisions striking for the rough
trail which led through apache gap
and on up the canon
chapter x
two visitors
the next day or two produced
small material change in the
troubled waters that threatened to
submerge the three star dot ranch
on newts account peggy tried to act
as if nothing serious was the matter
but at times it was hard to keep the look
of weary discouragement from show-
ing in her face
  for the time being she contemplated
no active steps aimed at foiling spof-
fords plot feeling that there was real-
ly nothing definite to be done the
only lawyer in cactus springs who pos-
sessed any ability-an unscrupulous in-
dividual named martin laurie-was
closely associated with spofford and
peggy could see scant hope in that
direction
   uncle eb says hes dead sure to
make a big strike newt informed
peggy one morning when she found
things looking especially black  right
away too he promised to have the
cash you need before spofford can do
a thing to kick us off
   did you tell uncle eb peggy
cried reproachfully you shouldnt
have done that newt
   why not i dont see an reason
to keep it dark id tell anybody i fig-
ured might be able to help us out what
we need is help-and a lot too
   but poor old uncle eb he has
troubles enough of his own without
having to wrorry over ours i dont be-
lieve theres gold in apache canon any-
how and if he did find a little i
wouldnt feel right about taking part
of it
  huh newt grunted youd
have to or uncle eb would throw a
flock of fits youve grub-staked him
enough so you ought to get something

argosy-allstory weekly
back newt regarded his sister anx-
iously  dont you believe hell make
a strike peggy gee he promised
me he would
   i know uncle eb would love to
save the ranch for us newt she re-
plied  but it takes more than wishes
to find the magic pot of gold under the
end of the rainbow
    anyway newt maintained  fel-
lows do make strikes all a chap needs
is some luck and uncle eb is due so
are we if anybody asked you and i
aint asking im telling you
  newts thoughts here wandered on
into other channels
   id like to know whats happened
to peter de quincy he ought to be
showing up seems as if i counted on
his blowing in quite a spell back
    i dare say youll see that puncher
one of these days peggy remarked
 it hasnt been very long since you met
him-only a trifle over a week but if
mr de quincy should visit us i cer-
tainly hope youll have enough family
pride to keep still about spofforcls
threat we ought to show a little dis-
cretionin such matters
    aw they wouldnt be any need of
telling him newt declared wisely
 peters the kind of a guy to find
things out for himself see wait
till you get a chance to know peter like
i do in rather a lofty fashion newt
succeeded in conveying the impression
that he and peter de quincy were
bosom friends
peter de quincys visit to the
three star dot was unavoidably
delayed by a hurried trip he took
out of the country on some mysterious
business
   peter had continued his sleuthing ac-
tivities in cactus springs and with
gratifying success he picked up a
good many stray and significant facts
regarding banker spofford and the lat-
ters associates from time to time
through judicious use of eyes and ears
in fact he found affairs in town so in-
triguing that he sincerely regretted the
necessity of a departure even though
his absence was to be only temporary
  had newt been aware of all this it
would have spared him a large amount
of wholly useless worry unfortunate-
ly he did not know
early one fine morning peggy re-
ceived a call from john marlbor-
ough spofford jr
  young spofford rode up quite jaunt-
ily with the air of one assured that his
arrival will be greeted by loud and lusty
cheers he was looking considerably
better than usual the marks of punish-
ment left by peter de quincys fists
having wholly disappeared
   hello peg was his greeting
 come on and take a ride he be-
stowed on peggy what he conceived to
be an ingratiating smile but achieved
only a sort of second-grade smirk
  thanks the young lady rejoined
shortly  but i dont feel like riding
this morning
  spoffords show of good nature re-
fused to be dashed by this lack of cor-
diality on the part of his fair hostess
he was in a jovial expansive mood
and withal not disposed to cavil at
small matters
   oh well all the same to me why
dont you say youre glad to see a
fellow
   because peggy informed him
 im handicapped by a certain amount
of respect for the truth
  spofford laughed dismounting from
his horse
   going to ask me in 
    i dont imagine thats necessary is
it she replied  youd come in any-
way-whether i asked you or not
  he laughed again
  of course i would-that is un-
less you stayed out wherever you
are little girl theres where i want to
be after you my dear gallantly
spofford held the door open with a
sweeping bow
trouble ranch

   peggy flushed a tart response on the
 tip of her tongue but decided to let
 the remark go unsaid spofford
 hooked his arm through hers in  a
 familiar proprietary way that any girl
 would have resented pointedly steer-
 ing toward the living room sofa
   with a sudden lithe twist she slipped
 from him selecting for herself a chair
 which had no close neighbors spof-
 ford accepted the rebuff without pro-
 test sitting down at a respectable dis-
 tance conversation threatened to die
 a slow death
   peggys caller eyed her appraisingly
 while rolling a smoke he scratched
 a match on his boot-sole and applied
 its flame to the tip of the cigarette
 inhaling deeply
   a couple of pennies for your
thoughts peggy said he at length
when the silence became oppressive
    youd regret paying so much for
 them she responded  theyre
 rather unflattering
    oh come on peg spofford pro-
 tested  unbend a little cant you
 give a fellow a chance
   peggys shapely hand ostentatiously
 went to her lips covering a little yawn
 she ventured no verbal response
    a pleasant time was had by all
 the visitor murmured ruefully  ive
 been to funerals that were more cheer-
 ful than this
this was the first effort of spof-
fords that won any approval
from his hostess in spite of her-
self she smiled-only a little but
enough for that ravishing dimple to
flash momentarily into view
    thats better spofford declared
 gratefully now i feel more at
 home for a moment he remained
 silent glancing at peggy with no at-
 tempt to conceal the admiration he felt
 then  i told my dad the glad news
 the other day he was tickled pink
  news peggy asked unguardedly
 what news she should have
 known better
 why that i expect to marry you
how extremely interesting
peggy said dryly  that is news isnt
it strange i hadnt heard and
gossip usually travels fast
   spoffords glance reflected a shade
less of confident self-assurance he
had expected a more or less violent
denial had been prepared for indigna-
tion stormy reproaches or even anger
but the cool note of cynically mocking
amusement in peggys voice had an
unpleasant sound he didnt quite
know what to make of it but none the
less plunged onward with reckless dis-
regard of consequences
    the old gent thinks a lot of you
peg guess theres no one hed rather
have for a daughter i want you two
to be good friends
  peggy failed to comment on this
hopeful assertion but the expression
on her pretty face held a world of
doubts as to the possibility of her ever
accepting banker spofford on terms
even approaching friendship
    you cant be blind to my feelings
spofford continued rashly refusing to
heed the danger signals which were
plain enough had he cared to see them
 ive been loving you for so long its
got to be second nature with me
  his voice took on a more tender
strain what do you say peg im
not such a bad sort he added in fatu-
ous complacency  id make a mighty
fine husband for you im crazy about
you peg i think youre the sweetest
finest girl that ever lived wont you
say yes and make me happy 
    there are just two reasons why i
would never marry you peggy re-
joined coldly though either alone
would be sufficient your father is
one-and you yourself are the other
spofford tried to speak but she gave
him no chance
    this worthy father of yours by a
contemptible trick stole three hundred
dollars from me and is now in a posi-
tion to steal our ranch-our home that
is-as -well newt and i have only the

argosy-allstory weekly
rest of the month to stay here i sup-
pose this was done in the vain hope of
forcing me to marry you in fact mr
spofford practically admitted as much
when he was-
   has my dad been out here to see
you  spofford exclaimed at last man-
aging to get in a word  i swear i
didnt know it peggy and i dont
get what youre talking about you
believe me when i say that dont you
peggy you must believe me
   i find it difficult to believe any-
thing a spofford tells me she rejoined
frigidly  experience is a dear teach-
er but the lessons learned are valu-
able
  spoffords face went livid but
whether from surprise or anger it was
not easy to say impetuously he jumped
from his chair peggy also rose fac-
ing him pale but cool and determined
   see here he snapped  im go-
ing to get to the bottom of this if
dad butted in it wasnt my fault and
you cant hold me responsible for what
he did or said the governor meant
well mebby but it strikes me he made
a botch of the whole business ill fix
things up so you dont lose the ranch
peggy thats a promise you wont
turn me down cold will you
  yes said peggy firmly thats
just what im doing i didnt ask you
to come here and i wish youd go
away its the only favor i want from
you
   hell spofford muttered under
his breath his features took on an
ugly sullen look  guess you want
to lose your ranch after all dont
you 
   i know too much to expect a spof-
ford to save it for me she declared
   you owe something to your kid
brother peg be tough for him to
fight his way without the help this
ranch will give him forgetting newt
aint you
   win newt over to your side and
id marry you in a minute what
youve just said is an insult to him if
he was as old as you youd never dare
hint even at such a vile bargain
spofford approached her angry
and threatening but the girl re-
fused to yield an inch and slowly
his anger was replaced by a sinister
covetous gleam yet more threatening
   gad he breathed  youre the
most beautiful creature on earth peg
mad at me or not i want you i cant
help it
   i dont want your love peggy
flared  leave my house at once
   whats the hurry spofford
grunted while peggy beginning at last
to be frightened watched the play of
expression in his evil eyes the mans
very soul was unbared before her
  in spite of her bold front peggy
shuddered at what she could see-lurk-
ing there beneath his eyes she re-
treated a step not daring to look away
as one who unarmed faces a wild
beast about to spring
   so you wont marry me eh pretty
peggy spofford muttered wetting
coarse thick lips with his tongue
im to go am i well ill have a
kiss-and a good one-beforei leave
  with a movement indescribably
swift he seized her just as newt tore
into the room
   hey you the boy screamed
 let my sister alone and newt in
a blind fury launched himself head-
long at the intruder
for a girl of perhaps less than
average height peggy winsome
certainly deserved to rank as far
from a weakling she was slight in
build to be sure but her slimness
masked a deceptive amount of sheer
physical prowess
  yet the bewildering speed spofford
displayed in his sudden attack had
taken her completely by surprise be-
fore peggy realized what to expect he
had seized her in a grasp which girlish
muscles could not break
  desperately she twisted and strug-
trouble ranch

gled arms pinned to her sides absolute-
ly no match for the man whose arms
circled her like steel bands his hot
breath fanned her face and peggy
shuddered nauseated at his nearness
filled with loathing and disgust at the
physical contact she had to endure
  newts hasty arrival on the scene of
conflict created a momentary diversion
in her favor from the corner of one
eye spofford glimpsed this counter at-
tack
   keep away damn  you keep
away he growled and aimed a vicious
kick at newt as the boy fearlessly
closed in eager to help his hard-pressed
sister
  spoffords boot caught newt full in
the pit of his stomach completely
knocking all his breath out of him
newt struck the floor half a dozen
feet from the combat gasping and all
but unconscious
   now spofford cried bending
over to reach peggys face  im go-
ing to help myself to that kiss all
hell cant stop me
  peggy said nothing saving her ef-
forts for a more effective form of re-
sponse spoffords flushed face came
yet the closer to hers bestial in its tri-
umphant leer
  a heavy substantial tread sounded
at the door spurs jingled musically
newt sobbing from sheer helplessness
glanced up as his ears caught the wel-
come sound spofford also heard it 
he too looked toward the door as it
opened and remained petrified into im-
mobility at the sight which met his ter-
rified gaze it was his nemesis peter
de quincy
  sock him peter newt cried
frantically  sock him-quick 
  the final word in newts injunction
was to tell the strict truth quite super-
fluous peter socked with right good
will and all the speed the occasion de-
manded
   i dont know just what all this is
about peter remarked voicing the
serene satisfaction that comes from the
consciousness of a good job well done
 but im sure glad i happened along
for a moment the room was in
more or less confusion peggy
inclined to be hysterical struggled
between tears and laughter  newt
grunting and holding fast to his stom-
ach but grinning from ear to ear
emerged from under the table where
spoffords brutal kick had flung him
   john marlborough jr lay prone on
the floor and gazed blankly up peter
eyed the recumbent form with every
evidence of distaste
    first thing this place needs he
opined  is house cleaning
  stooping he seized john marl-
borough spofford jr by the collar
snapping the no longer jaunty lothario
to an upright position with a brisk
jerk
   when youve apologized to the
young lady said he  you can straddle
your cayuse and ride out of the
picture
   spofford goggled at his captor sadly
dazed peter shook him vigorously
until the teeth rattled in an attempt at
resuscitation then repeated his com-
mand with an emphasis that carried
the unmistakable threat of additional
punishment
  spofford mumbled an indistinct
something to peggy which peter was
generous enough to accept as an
apology still gripping the demoralized
youth by the coat collar he escorted
him to the door completing the bounc-
ing act with a none too gentle shove
   on your way hombre said he
 and stay awav
   then peter turned back into the liv-
ing room
    hurt newt he asked solicitously
   naw newt disclaimed grinning
in huge delight that his hero had finally
appeared  i aint hurt any he kicked
me one in the belly and it sort of
knocked the wind out for a minute im
all right now peter
    im glad to hear it old timer that

argosy-allstory weekly
being the case suppose you do the
honors how bout making me ac-
quainted with your sister
  newts grin broadened if possible
   this is peter peg he said proud-
ly with a gesture toward his friend
peter id like you to shake hands with
my sister peggy
the brief colloquy between newt
and the cowboy gave peggy op-
portunity to take a firm grip on
things she was a very self-possessed
young person anyway and her attack
of nerves and near-hysterics passed as
quickly as it came she now smiled
at the rescuer-a demure little smile
with the dimple working
  she extended a slim brown hand
 ive heard such wonderful reports of
pete im very pleased to meet you
mr de quincy
   the pleasure maam is mine
peter responded bowing
   i kinda hoped youd be along be-
fore now peter newt ventured
  why now thats too bad newt
said he  i wanted to come sooner
but part of the time ive been away
from cactus springs
   you sure picked a good time to
blow in at that newt conceded
   indeed you did peggy echoed
warmly  i cant thank you enough
mr de quincy that unspeakable
cad- she flushed overcome by
anger at thought of what had so re-
cently passed  if you hadnt come-
when you did-
   thats all right miss winsome
peter said soothingly  riff-raff like
spofford aint worth getting upset over
socking him is something i sure do
enjoy
  newt pricked up his ears in sudden
interest
   have you ever socked him before
peter he demanded
  peters eyes twinkled mischievously
as he glanced at the boy
   once he confessed  no-twice
this makes three times altogether
   my goodness peggy gasped in
mock consternation  is-er-socking
folks a habit with you mr de
quincy 
   not generally he grinned  only
folks like spofford then its not only
a duty maam but a pleasure as well
but lets dont talk about him any
more
   ive one other thing to thank you
for peggy said  helping my
brother that day he rode to cactus
springs you won my gratitude and
newts undying affection
   i didnt do a thing maam peter
cried  only ride along with the boy
he made mighty good company for
me too
   did you find that guy that stuck
me up newt demanded eagerly
 or the cayuse with the moon-shaped
scar on his back
  i managed to find em both peter
told him  first the bronc and then
the rider also his false whiskers
he want quite so old as you figured
him newt
   hurray the boy yelped whatd
you do about it peter
   nothing said peter  he dont
even know i found him
   nothing newt repeated blankly
yet peter amended his statement
 im letting the play ride awhile he
turned-to peggy obviously anxious to
include her in the conversation  i
think its a bad policy to pick green
fruit said peter  whats your
ideas on that subject miss winsome
maam 
peggy laughed already feeling
at home in petes presence she
could quite understand how he had
captured newts heart in so short a
time besides he was so terribly
good-looking with that quizzically
humorous way he had of twinkling his
eyes
   green fruit she told him  is
something i never had the least use
for
trouble ranch

   me either peter agreed  it
ought to stay on the tree till it gets
good and ripe
   by all means peggys blue eyes
smiled into his gray ones in complete
understanding newt glanced from
one to the other mystified and feeling
a little out of it all
   aw gee he grumbled talk
sense cant you i wasnt mentioning
anything about fruit-ripe or green
   its like this old timer peter said
taking pity on him  the lad that
tried to hold you up might be regarded
as a green persimmon we aim to let
him struggle along for a spell and see
if he dont get ripe enough to fall off
the tree then hell be tastier
   oh newt remarked mollified as
he gained an insight into the complica-
tions of this affair  you want to get
something more on the hombre do you
peter
   its a good deal like that peter
admitted
   think you will
   i hope so young mr de onincy
answered venturing to wink at peggy
 shot off all those s you bought in
town last week old timer 
   i didnt buy any newt said
 changed my mind when i got to the
store
   why dont you tell mr de quincy
the whole story peggy put in 
will newt she informed peter
 bought me a beautiful box of candy
with the money instead of pistol car-
tridges for himself what do you
think of a boy who would do that mr
de quincy
   id say he was a regular guy
peter declared positively  yes miss
peggy maam id be bold to remark
that it was a plumb noble and un-
selfish deed especially for a lad that
hankered to feel the kick of a  in
his fist
  aw gee newt muttered con-
siderably flustered but none the less
delighted at peters outspoken praise
it was indeed pleasant thus to win the
approval of one he admired so cor-
dially
  i thought mebby you might have
shot em all away peter went on
 so i brought along three four extra
boxes with me theyre in the saddle-
bags on my bronc like for us to see
if theyre any good old timer
  gosh thats dandy newt en-
thused  im sure obliged to you
peter
   dont mention it son was the
reply newt lost no time in starting
for the door peter cast a significant
glance at peggy  wouldnt you like
to be a spectator at the obsequies of a
few tomato cans maam he sug-
gested hopefully
   i was going to beg an invitation if
you hadnt asked me peggy laughed
 though of course-i dont wish to
intrude
   intrude p d o echoed re-
proachfully  why miss peggy
maam your presence would make
the affair a howling success your ab-
sence would shroud it with gobs of dark
gloom
  peggy pretended to be altogether
overcome at this flowery outburst but
secretly rather liked it mr de quincy
had the subtle knack of making a girl
believe what he said however extrav-
agant so the three of them went
outdoors
from his capacious saddlebags
peter like a benevolent magician
produced the boxes of shells for
newt also a package which he ten-
dered to peggy
   do i get something too she ex-
claimed  now arent you the nice
young man
   i was well brought up peter
modestly admitted
  peggys gift proved to be candy
another one of those nifty boxes tied
with silk ribbon such as newt had
bought her and she generously shared
it with the two marksmen during their
target practice newt was in the

argosy-allstory weekly
seventh heaven with peter de quincy
there to supervise his pistol shooting
and give a few much needed point-
ers on the finer technique of gun-sling-
ing 
   dinner time came eventually and
naturally the guest was urged to stay
naturally he accepted after the meal
was over dishes washed and put
neatly away peter said something
about the possibilities of a ride out on
the range
   now it was not so many hours since
john marlborough spofford jr had
made that same suggestion with most
discouraging results but peggys ideas
concerning a ride on the range had
somehow changed
  here was where newt showed him-
self to be a youth of rare discernment
newt saw how the prospects loomed
up grinned wisely and drifted off
leaving peter to entertain his sister-a
little matter that peter noted with full
appreciation
   horses were presently saddled
   where do we ride  the cow-
puncher asked  im a stranger sort
of to most parts of this country here-
abouts miss peggy so youre better
able to pick out the high spots
    i like it up apache canon peggy
told him  and often ride there its
quite worth seeing really
    then thats where we go peter
responded
laughing and chatting together
u just like old friends the two rode
in through the gap and on up
apache canon peggy found it easy
to laugh spontaneously and naturally
in peters society he was so different
in every way from young spofford
   for the time she managed to forget
the trouble that lurked like a sable
cloud close to the near horizon to ig-
nore the sinister banker spofford and
his shady schemes they got on as-
tonishingly well did peter de ouincy
and peggy and it must be confessed
that the scenic beauties of apache
canon were rather neglected though
once or twice peggy did make perfunc-
tory efforts to call her companions at-
tention to the landscape
   without peggys realizing it the ride
at length took them up to the region
where eb sanderson had his headquar-
ters peter glanced questioningly at
the shack
   mv nearest neighbor lives here
she told him  hes a very nice man
demurely with a mischievous side
glance to see how peter took it  i
like him a lot
   bettern you like spofford eh
peter grinned and peggy blushed
   very much better was her re-
sponse
   like him bettern you do me i
wonder peter inquired pointedly
  peggy appeared to give this mature
consideration secretly questioning if
peter might so soon be beginning to
show evidence of jealousy the symp-
toms were quite encouraging
   do you think thats a fair ques-
tion  she countered
   sure peter declared boldly
 everythings fair in love and war-
and this aint war they sat on their
horses not far from the humble cabin
sanderson had preempted as a hermit
crab seizes the cast-off shell of some
neighbor
    oh im glad it isnt war peggy
said mockingly you have such an
efficient way of carrying on hostilities
mr de quincy i think youd be a
dangerous enemy
   id rather make love to a pretty
girl than make war on a man any time
peter stated
    and i bet youve had lots and lots
of practice at both she told him her
eyes dancing with merriment
   why miss peggy maam what-
ever makes you think that
    oh its easy enough to see she
replied airily  youre so very adept
which ever line you follow up i
know and peggy gave her pretty
head a wise little toss
trouble ranch

   but about this friend of yours
peter remarked  likely he squatted
down here so hed be near you i
wouldnt blame him if he did
   its nice of you to say that but i
think the lure was something quite dif-
ferent you see my friend is an old
desert prospector named eb sanderson
and he has a hunch that theres gold
in apache canon
   and he wastes his time hunting for
gold-when youre within reach
peter exclaimed  he must be old
miss peggy mighty old-or else stone
blind
  peggy blushed engagingly at this ex-
pression of opinion
   thats just some more proof of
what i said mr de quincy a man
couldnt do as well as you unless hed
had endless practice why it would
be simply impossible but im sorry
uncle eb doesnt seem to be at home
youd enjoy meeting him hes quite
a character really
   these old desert rats most always
are peter asserted  i bet he figures
pretty positive that hes due to make a
strike some of these days
   so he says peggy smiled though
a little worried at the way this conver-
sation seemed to be shaping itself she
hoped peter would not be too curious
as to uncle eb and his possible strikes
a savage sort of pride-a foolish pride
perhaps-made peggy desire to keep
this new friend in ignorance of the
trouble she was facing
  they lingered there for a few min-
utes talking then continued their ride
how are things going with the
three star dot these days miss
peggy peter presently asked
his tone sounded innocent enough but
she flashed him a swift inquiring
glance
   why do you ask that  she mur-
mured
   newt told me that day i met him
how youd been up against it sort of
since mr winsome was killed i was
mighty sorry-about it all he let
drop one or two other facts to-day-
when you werent around
  peggy looked startled wondering
how much peter knew after all
   it has been a struggle she admit-
ted trying to keep her tone light-heart-
ed  but i always believe in making
the best of things newt im afraid
told you more than he should
  de quincy ignored this
   im sure hoping youll forgive me
for butting in miss peggy but youre
in a pretty tight jam with the ranch
aint you
   please peggy begged  its been
too beautiful a day to talk of such
things ive had a delightful time and
i hate to spoil it
   i hope you wontjoe mad at-what
im going to say miss peggy and
peters voice was tense in his earnest-
ness weve been joshing along
talking this and that but some of my
remarks that mebbe you took for fool-
ing were anything else but
   i think youre the finest loveliest
girl i ever met and the pluckiest i
want to be your friend id be proud
to help you a little-if i could and
youd allow me
  peggy hesitated hardly knowing
how to reply she was in such desper-
ate need of help and friendly counsel-
just the sort of help it seemed to her
that a man like peter de ouincy might
bring
   its very kind of you- to say that
she faltered blaming the weakness that
made her want to yield and yet dearly
wishing to yield at the same time
   kind he echoed  shucks miss
peggy it aint kindness that makes
me eager to help you out you have
picked up a fresh batch of trouble late-
ly aint that the truth
  peggy nodded unable to hold out
longer
   newts been calling our place
trouble ranch she whispered  it
seems a very appropriate name
   i guess thats no lie peter added

argosy-allstory weekly
grimly  dont you want to tell me
about it miss peggy some of the
most important part leastwise a
little ive already guessed at
peggy could not resist his friendly
insistence so she told peter the
story of what happened after
newt left him in cactus springs and
banker spoffords visit to the ranch
of course she did not mention the al-
ternative spofford had offered her but
peter was no fool and easily enough
put two and two together
   a man that would put over a trick
like that on a boy said he  is so low
he could crawl under a side winders
belly and never scrape the top of his
head i might have crimped the play
if id trailed along with newt when
he paid the money its my fault part-
ly miss peggy
   indeed it is not she maintained
heatedly  its foolish to blame your-
self for that pe-mr de ouincy
   shucks miss peggy he drawled
whimsically grinning at her  what-
ever did you have to go and spoil it
for i dont like to be mistered-by
my best friends it sounds too daw-
goned formal
   it was a slip though peggy con-
fessed  not what i meant to say
at all
   yes you did and youre going to
say it again-lots of times he as-
sured her  but im not disposed to
argue with you now the trouble
youre in is one of the reasons why
sanderson hopes to strike it rich isnt
it
  peggy smiled though rather tremu-
lously
  you seem to know everything
without my telling you mr de ouincy
newt as youve already seen will tell
all there is to tell if given the least
bit of encouragement he told uncle
eb about how i needed six thousand
dollars to save the ranch
   poor old uncle eb is really quite
destitute and ive helped him a little
from time to time though he would
only accept my aid on a grubstake basis
ive given him food and some old
clothes-coats and so on-of dads
which he needed badly
   now the poor old man thinks hes
going to make a wonderful strike and
return the favor im awfully sorry
for him
   thats a right noble ambition hes
cherishing miss peggy but i wouldnt
bank very heavy on it
  of course im not so foolish
peggy insisted  newt took uncle
ebs promise seriously however he
was quite downcast when i tried to
show him how utterly hopeless it all
was
    things arent so hopeless at that
peter remarked quietly
  what do you mean
  peter de ouincy seemed so calmly
sure of himself that a new hope be-
gan to dawn in peggys breast
   whj i mean peter said  that
theys a chance banker spoffords
bitten off more than he can swallow-
and be comfortable in the process ive
been following that hombres trail like
a hound dog ever since the time newt
and i bumped into each other and im
finding out things
    i havent found out everything yet
not by a long shot but if spofford
knew what i have learned hed be
plenty worried he paused to chuckle
reminiscently  i was just wonder-
ing miss peggy how much youd
be inclined to trust me in this busi-
ness
   how much id trust you  she re-
peated puzzled
   prezactiy that would you be
willing to let me go ahead handling
your affairs pretty much like they was
my own that degree of confidence
is a lot to expect especialty when
mebby i wouldnt tell you all of what
i was aiming to do and how i counted
on working it
   i know of only one person i could
trust that far peggy smiled  his
trouble ranch

name is peter de quincy i-i dont
quite know what to say i ought not
to let you do this but-i cant refuse
even though i told newt that we
mustnt let you know of our difficulties
youve done so much already-for
newt and me that it seems like an im-
position on your good nature
   i consider that youre granting me
a favor miss peggy peter stated
 now about this mortgage your dad
signed it seems funny hed agree to
anything so unfair and foolish the
deal was all in spoffords favor
   ive thought of that but poor dad
was careless in some ways also too
ready to trust the word of others his
name was on the paper and everything
seemed to be regular
   hed likely had a copy some-
where peter suggested 
   of course he must have had one
originally but we never succeeded in
finding it among his other private pa-
pers
   that detail cant be helped then
said peter  but im making you a
promise here and now spofford
wont get your ranch
  are you sure of that peter
peggy cried not realizing that uncon-
sciously she had used his first name
  yes maam peter rejoined
 im plumb sure of it even if all the
parts aint quite worked out so they
fit
   ill leave it all to you peggy said
softly her blue eyes glowing with hap-
piness all of a sudden everything
seemed rosy once more the threaten-
ing storm clouds already disappear-
ing
   even if i dont keep you posted on
everything he insisted  and spose
i come to you and ask for something
that sounds like a lot-something that
might give me a chance to do what
spoffords trying to put over against
you do you figure you could keep
on trusting me
  yes peggy whispered  ill
trust you-peter and that time she
used his first name intentionally and
with full knowledge of what she did
peter grinned contentedly at her
 good said he  now were
through talking business im
certainly pleased to see how well you
remember my first name speaking of
names it just occurred to me theys
something queer with yours its
wrong end to
    just what do you mean by saying
that my names queer mister de
quincy she demanded roguishly
  why they call you peggy win-
some me-i think it ought to be the
other way round-winsome peggy

chapter xi
young mr spofford and iiis pals
john marlborough spof-
ford jr departed from the
three star dot ranch in a truly
pitiable condition his head still ached
as a result of its forceful contact with
p d qs muscular fist but mentally
he was even worse off
   spofford possessed his full share of
personal pride and it is indeed a try-
ing experience for any man to be
beaten up in the presence of a girl-
especially one to whom he has just
proposed marriage a cold fury
seethed through j m jrs brainat
the thought of what a miserable show-
ing he had made before peggy
    likely i played the fool with her
he mused  letting myself go that way
but there wasnt any occasion for the
damned broncho-forker to horn in im
getting tired of being a punching bag
for him hes tapped me the last
time
   but even in his rage spofford was
not wholly blind to self-interest not
enough so that he cared to wait at the
winsome ranch for a chance to shoot
things out with his enemy spofford
carried a gun which he would not have

argosy-allstory weekly
  hesitated to use under favorable cir-
  cumstances he was brave-if the other
  man wasnt looking
     trouble is that range riders liable
 to be chain lightning with his iron
 spofford muttered  im going to col-
 lect pay for what hes done me but
 ill play her safe i dont want any
 forty-fives messing up my gizzard-
 yet he spoke wistfully yearning to
 see de quincy wilt through a haze of
 pistol smoke eager for the boundless
 satisfaction of killing this enemy with
 his own hand the wish however
 was futile as spofford well knew he
 was too yellow to risk his skin
   his fathers method of hiring some
 one else to do the dirty work offered
 a safer and easier mode of removing
 an undesirable person
   spoffords rage included peggy as
 well as her rescuer
    shell be begging me to marry her
 fore im through with this business
 and when the time comes im damned
 if i do it she can go to hell
   spofford thus beguiled the tedium of
 his trip into town by anticipating in
 advance the pleasures of revenge
 against the two persons who had pun-
 ished him
    ill settle with the cow-puncher
 first he told himself  then when
 hes pushing up the prairie flowers ill
 be ready to show peg winsome where
 she gets off nobodys going to make
 a fool out of me-man or woman
arriving at length in cactus
k springs spofford started on the
trail of carl davis and mexican
charlie the chosen instruments of his
vengeance against peter neither of
these worthies was he able to locate
and finally spofford asked sid varney
proprietor of the red front
  they aint around varney ex-
 plained answering spoffords query
  some folks give a baile over to the
 french creek schoolhouse last night
 and the boys aimed to take in the fes-
 tivities
   f wrhen they coming back do you
  know sid spofford asked trying to
  conceal his impatience at this threat-
  ened setback to the program he had
  outlined
     i expect theyll likely show up here
  this afternoon why whats doing
  anyway j m 
    nothing much spofford replied
  only a little matter of private busi-
 ness id like to talk over
     guess it ought to be arranged easy
 suppose i fix things so you can meet
 carl and mex up in no  to-night-
 at any time you say i know carls
 coming to see me and if mex isnt
 along hell get the word to him
 spofford pondered this proposal
 finding it good
    make it nine thirty sharp sid
and you might have some cards and
poker chips up in seven also whisky
and a box of cigars so we can make
a party of it
   just the three of you varney
asked
    thats all sid ill count on you
 for the arrangements keep it dark
 of course
   the two thereupon separated spof-
 ford going his way well content that
 an auspicious start had been made un-
 known to either him or varney how-
 ever aleck carmichael had chanced to
 overhear the major portion of their
 conversation aleck said nothing but
 he did a certain amount of sober think-
 ing
   about time when things were be-
ginning to liven up for the evening
peter de quincy dropped in at the
red front carmichael was on duty
behind the bar and peter approached
smiling cheerfully still mellow from
the inspiration of a glorious afternoon
spent in peggy winsomes society
  under cover of pouring the customer
 a drink aleck whispered
   been pulling spoffords tail again
 lately p d q 
   howd you guess it  peter
chuckled
                          	a
trouble ranch

   a hunch p d o spoffords ar-
ranged a pow-wow with a couple of
tough birds in room  upstairs nine
thirtys the time i think your case
is to be settled peter suddenly stiff-
ened  take it easy or youll give
the thing away in case any ones
watching thus warned peter re-
laxed
   thats the best one ive heard in a
long time aleck he laughed as if the
bartender had just cracked a rare jest
 ill spring it myself when i get a
chance slip me a fistful of cigars
will you those will do and he in-
dicated a box
  aleck passed over several and buried
among them was a key which peter ac-
cepted without comment
   number sevens at the end of the
hall on the left the bartender said
sotto voce  if yous in six this
side you can hear what goes on the
keyll take you in and id be there if
i was you might hear something
worth learning
  peter bit the end from a smoke
lighting it negligently he glanced
around the room with a casual show of
interest in what went on
   how can i get up there-without
making it too prominent he whis-
pered lips hardly moving as they
formed the words
   by the outside stairways best
they aint due for awhile yet but
youd better shake a leg
  peter showed by a glance that he
understood and after a brief interval
left the bar puffing at his cigar
the second floor of varneys estab-
lishment could be gained by two
routes one flight of stairs leading
up directly from the gambling room
and saloon for obvious reasons this
was undesirable and peter followed
alecks advice making a swift but
silent ascent by way of outdoors
  he found himself in a dark hall
rooms on each side but no signs of life
anywhere about underneath could
  a
be heard a subdued murmur of con-
versation the occasional clinking of
glasses and bottles the rattle of poker
chips the monotonous voice of the
croupier at varneys roulette wheel
  moving with considerable caution
peter slowly worked a passage down
the hard hallway
  end room-on the left he
grunted stopping before the last door
this he explored with the tips of his
fingers  check peter muttered
recognizing number seven by touch
  next he retraced his steps to the ad-
jacent room assuring himself by a
similar process that it was number six
the door was locked but peters key
fitted noiselessly he entered locking
the door from the inside and putting
the key in his pocket his fingers en-
countered a sliding bolt but he did not
use it
   wonder what sort of a hole this
is peter thought  guess im early
enough so a match wont queer the
game might be a wise hunch to get
an idea of the lay-out ahead of time
  a match flared instantly to be ex-
tinguished as peters hasty glance
registered the details of the room at
one side was a bed close to it a bureau
a curtain draped across one corner
former a sort of clothes closet between
this room and number seven was a door
secured by a bolt similar to the one
peter had already found
  nothing to do now but wait he
thought  ho hum i hope they
show speed a-coming i hate hanging
around
  he sat on the bed resigned to the
inevitable presently the orchestra
began playing downstairs accompanied
by the scraping feet of dancers half
an hour thus dragged by then three-
quarters
   most time now peter mused
hopefully
  ten minutes later he heard the
sound of footsteps in the hall outside
they stopped at his door and for a
minute peter experienced a small panic

argosy-allstory weekly
thinking aleck might have picked the
wrong room
   anybody in here i wonder it
was spoffords voice
  not likely some one assured
him  but you got a pass key open
her up and take a look
   peter left the bed making a hasty
noiseless dive for the shelter of the
curtain congratulating himself on the
forethought he had displayed in re-
moving his key and not bolting the
door on the inside either of which
would have proved that the room was
occupied the door opened and several
men stepped in
    gosh im glad this curtain comes
plumb to the floor peter thought as
one of the intruders struck a match
 it would be plenty embarrassing if
my boot-heels showed
   what the hell peter did not rec-
ognize the voice but inferred that it
belonged to mr davis  were wast-
ing time this place is empty as a
church lets go
   no harm in playing safe spofford
said
 the match died out and peters
visitors departed locking the door be-
hind them
    whew peter breathed his relief
 thats too close to being caught for
comfort after taking all this trouble
id sure hate to miss hearing what those
hombres are aiming to talk about
   he removed his boots to lessen
chances of discovery and then took up
a position by the door between the two
rooms on his knees one eye glued to
the keyhole a lamp was presently
lighted in the next room and peter
managed to identify spoffords two
companions
   i thought those might be the guys
he mused what next
chairs were pulled up at a table
and the trio sat down spofford
filled three glasses from a quart
whisky bottle
    how about that business  he de-
manded  you fellows ready to tackle
it right away 
   whats the hurry mexican
charlie inquired
    thats what you said before
spofford told him angrily  im tired
of waiting what i want now is action
and i want it pronto that fellow
took another crack at me to-day and
hes got to be settled
   carl davis and mexican charlie re-
 garded each other thoughtfully but
 ventured no response spofford grew
 impatient
   well he insisted say some-
thing
     its worth a thousand apiece to us 
 thats the ante is it davis de-
 manded
   a thousand is what i promised
mex and i always stick to my bar-
gains its a lot of money for one
killing though and if you guys dont
want the job just say so theys
other men would jump at the chance
  pick up some soft money
   whos saying we dont want it
davis grumbled
    you dont act very keen you both
 afraid of that red-head spofford re-
 plied cuttingly
    of course senor spofford ees not
 afraid of heem charlie put in with
 an ill-concealed sneer
    thatll do from you spofford
snapped  were here to settle the
business definitely not start a crabbing
party ive had too much talk and too
little action already
we aint been idle davis told
him  fact is weve got the thing all
lined up
   good enough spofford ap-
proved thats something like
whats the scheme
  davis glanced inquiringly at mex-
 ican charlie as if to ask  shall we
 tell him   charlie nodded with an
 indifferent shrug of his spare shoulders
 tt j ke this davis went on
the fellow you want has a front
room on the second floor at the phosnix
trouble ranch

house see weve been watching
and most every night he sits in a chair
tor awhile and reads a newspaper or
something before hitting the hay
   the window shades down but the
lamp is on a table behind him and
throws the hombres shadow onto the
shade plain as daylight
   opposite across the street is an
empty room me and mex have a key
to that room also we got a rifle with
one of them new-fangled silencers
fitted to it were ready to touch him
off any time you say hows that for
a plot
   all right spofford admitted
grudgingly  but id say you were
taking an awful lot of trouble 
  youre crazy davis exclaimed
the beauty ofthis scheme is that it
aint no trouble a-tall nor any
chance of a come-back either no-
body hears a gun shot see  count the
silencer muffles it down to a little puff
   sure you could get him-shooting
at his shadow spofford objected
   sa-ay why man its a cinch
if we dont get him you dont pay us
aint that fair enough
  spofford was forced to acknowledge
the reasonableness of this arrangement
    who fires the rifle he asked
   we aint decided that yet davis
replied  but either of us is willing to
how about it mex he appealed to
his associate who nodded while
drinking mexican charlie seemed
content to let mr davis act as spokes-
man  when do you want the job
pulled carl went on addressing
spofford
  right away to-night
   davis hesitated
   thats crowding her some strikes
me and we might not have the
chance some evenings when weve
watched the guy dont sit so his
shadows on the window shade we
can try her out though no harm in
that
   to-morrow night anyway spof-
ford insisted  i wont be downright
happy till that broncho-forkers
planted
  dont love him any do you
davis said with a chuckle
   no and spofford swore vicious-
ly  and i shouldnt think you
would he didnt handle either of
you fellows any too gently-that time
down in the room below
   right you are davis said with
a flash of temper  ill be just as
tickled as you to see him go under for
keeps you can count on to-morrow
if we dont get the job done to-night
 fair enough spofford told him
 ill have the cash ready when youve
earned it
as might be supposed de ouincy
 took all this in with no little
gratification though he was not
particularly surprised peter had
rather expected something in the way
of a come-back from spofford  com-
pany and now realized that in all prob-
ability he owed his life to alecks timely
warning
   i was figuring on something but
not just this he mused  looks like
i was treading closer to the big divide
than i imagined but now i know
what their play is i can act according
thats a big debt i owe aleck
   the party next door was on the point
of breaking up spofford poured a
final round of drinks and they pres-
ently left going dowtn to the lower
floor by the inside stairs the cards and
poker chips provided by varney being
unused as a matter of fact spofford
had made the suggestion of axard
game mainly as a blind to the real pur-
pose of the conference
  peter gave them plenty of time to
get out of the way and finally pulled on
his boots he went out by the same
route he had entered
  an hour later peter again appeared
-unobtrusively-within the red
front stopping at the bar for a drink
his glance told aleck carmichael that
all was serene

argosy-allstory weekly
  dirty work in the air aleck
muttered as he poured peter a glass of
liquor
  de quincy nodded
   i might need your help aleck can
you get off to-morrow night and come
to my room at about eleven
  carmichael nodded almost imper-
ceptibly
   keep the business under your hat
use the back entrance at the phcenix
then peter paid for the liquor and
moved on
  it was approaching midnight when
he strolled into the hotel and went up-
stairs to his room before lighting
the lamp peter carefully placed it to
one side taking pains that his shadow
did not fall on the lowered shade
   if that lad across the way expects
to pot me to-night hes liable to be dis-
appointed peter chuckled grimly  i
dont want to be potted to-night to-
morrows much better by then ill
have things all fixed to give him a nice
to be continu
littl surprise i think kind of hes
due for a decided shock to his nervous
system
   peter felt quite pleased with himself
and justly so for the day had been both
enjoyable and profitable
   i got acquainted with miss peggy
he mused  who is certainly one fine
girl i won her around so shes will-
ing for me to help her and thats a
big step in the right direction and
finally thanks to good old aleck im
going to have a hold on some of these
bad actors right where the hair grows
short and tender business is sure
booming
  whereupon young mr de ouincy
blew out his light and tumbled into
bed wholly unworried by the knowl-
edge that a would-be assassin lurked
across the street waiting for a chance
to send a bullet through the window
peter de quincy was the sort of in-
dividual who preferred to let other
gentlemen do his worrying for him

modernism invades the ozarks
t ven the ozark mountain country is feeling the effects of modernism in
thought and industry and a plea to its people to preserve some remnants
of the old era has been made by the missouri state historical society
    residents of the ozark mountains are asked to retain some of the old
water mills and the virginia worm rail fences for it is these things that lead
tourists to visit the country and not the fine dairy herds and modern farms
it is the ozarks made famous by rose wilder lane harold bell wright and
sara teasdale that the historical society wants to preserve in part at least
    then there are the old ozark ballads and songs peculiar to the mountain
folk which are now in danger of being lost forever unless efforts are made to
hand them down as they have been for generations the art of the old-time
fiddler too is in danger of passing with the waning popularity of the square
dances even the preservation of some moonshiners still which has ceased to
function would add a touch pleasing in the eyes of the members of the his-
torical society not to mention the many tourists seeking local color
                                                     harold j ashe
out of the sky
dink wanted to be a real reporter not
just a sob-sister but thats a tough
assignment for any girl
by jack woodford
dink brought her ancient liz-
zie  to a stop beside the curb
before an old brownstone resi-
dence in what had once been the better
quarter of town
though it was but a few minutes
after  am there was a small crowd
around the gates leading to the stone
steps of the mansion
a patrol wagon stood at the curb
and behind it the big cadillac with a
gong mounted upon the running board
that belonged to the police departments
homicide squad
  dink was unnoticed as she wriggled her flash light glanced upon some long sticks
her way through the crowd she was
slight of build there was nothing at high apartment buildings that seemed
all distinctive about her very plain to strive impatiently to push it out of
and inconspicuous she looked in her the path of progress
blue serge suit and small tight black in an upstairs room impressive with
hat her features were plain and she priceless original chippendale dink
affected no cosmetics beyond the dash found gathered a knot of men she
of white powder on her nose which de- recognized billings an assistant cor-
cency demanded	oner there were several other report-
  reaching the door of the mansion ers an assistant states attorney and
she showed her press card and was ad- half a dozen officers two of them in
mitted	uniform the rest in plain clothes dink
  in the hall subdued cresset lights po- looked resolutely down at the floor
litely rebuked the unusual disturbance guiltily conscious that she was a little
which had come to the staid old man- afraid to
sion it was a residence that would stretched out a red stain upon his

in the early nineties but it was a dis- old man
tinct anachronism in the neighborhood hughson the assistant states at-
now on both sides it was flanked by tornev was saying


argosy-allstory weekly
   he was always bringing some of
his stuff home with him ought to
have known better in this day and age
what good is a safe nowadays as
he finished speaking two men whom
dink recognized as detective bureau
plain clothes men came out of a door
in the room leading a servant between
them fhe old fellow was badly up-
set one of the detectives said dis-
gustedly 
   nothing on him hes o k been
working for thornton darn near half
a century says he was the only serv-
ant in the house last night cook went
to stay with her daughter chauffeur
off duty
  the old servant stood in the center
of the floor nervously wringing his
hands
  these men said i did it sir he
mourned addressing hughson who
brushed the remark aside and ignored
the servant
  dink worked her way to the old fel-
lows side and laid a hand gently upon
his arm he jumped and looked down
at her fearfully
    thats just a way they have of try-
ing to trap people into making remarks
that will help to clear up cases she ex-
plained   they dont think you had
anything to do with it if they did
theyd have acted very differently im
a reporter she added almost apolo-
getically as if by way of explaining
the reason for her especial knowledge
of such things
for the first time one of the men re-
porters present consciously noticed
dink
    hello dink he called out  did
you come over to clear up the case
the other reporters laughed the po-
lice officers grinned even the states
attorney allowed his frown to relax a
little
  dink did not reply and she tried
hard to smile though she paled a little
she knew well that these other news-
paper men one of whom was from the
star her own paper considered her
nothing but a pensioner
  presently two more plain-clothes of-
ficers entered and attention was with-
drawn from dink she listened eagerly
to what the newcomers said
    not a thing to go on chief one of
them began addressing grieb the
lieutenant of police in charge of the
homicide squad  watchman says he
wasnt away from the place a minute
all night because he knew most of the
servants were out
   the dogs down in the yard are all
o k havent been doped or any-
thing every window and door in the
place is intact burglar alarms all in
working order-havent been tapped or
cut anywheres its impossible any-
body could of got to the house past
the watchman the dogs and the electric
alarms
   well somebody did get in thats
rather obvious isnt it snapped
grieb angrily  and out again too-
thats rather more obvious we dont
know that they may not have been hid-
ing inside for some time previous to
last night but we certainly do know
that theyre not inside now
  one of the reporters said
   therell be hell raised about this
after all the other rough work pulled
this month the towns biggest jew-
eler bumped off-and no clews-as
usual
   grieb was plainly irritated at the im-
plied criticism he returned
  well what am i to do nobody
could have got in nobody got out
nobody near him that could have
knocked him off except old half dead
over there in the corner no jury d
ever believe he did it even if i did get
him to say he did
   what am i going to do  am i a
fortune teller or a magician you
wise-cracking press fellows are always
yelling for action-why dont some of
you find out who bumped off thornton
and make a nice elusive out of it
thats the way they used to do in the
out of the sky

days when they had newspaper men in
this town instead of  journalists 
during this exchange of compli-
ments the homicide squad left
to hunt for the missing servants
and the reporters started after them
leaving a city news association man
on the ground
   coming along dink one of the
reporters called she shook her head
and blushed
   no im going to stick around and
see if i cant turn up something the
other reporters laughed jeeringly she
winced but squared a firm little jaw
and compressed her lips
   what gets me the coroner com-
plained  is the fact that this house is
one of the best protected places in town
so far as automatic devices go whats
the use of automatic protection if-
just then more detectives came in from
searches of the premises
   not a thing they reported  the
old guy had an alarm on everything
in the place none of the alarms been
tampered with he ought to of had
that old safe wired too-but i suppose
he figured that was no use since any
kid with a can opener could crack it
theres only one place whoever done
it could of come from-and thats the
sky
  dink pricked up her ears at this and
without thinking blurted out
    well lets go up and look in the at-
tic then
  the officers roared the city news
association drudge who had remained
to pick up dribbles of news joined in
the laugh adding
   youre a great kid dink your
old man ought to of heard that his
expression was not unkindly but dink
flushed under his glance for she knew
that he too considered her a sort of
charity patient on the pay roll of her
paper to cover up her chagrin she
went out into the hall and mounted the
stairs to the third floor
  during the eighteen months after
her fathers death that she had worked
for his old paper she had seldom
worked on assignment the editors
had very little faith in her ability to
develop a story
  she had been permitted to wander
around much as she liked since her
salary was small not that any one
was ever deliberately unkind to her
they all  gave her the breaks but it
was on account of her father and the
reverence they bore for his memory
besides being a marvelously good news-
paper man he had been as some of
them phrased it a  damn fine scout
  several years before her fathers
death dinks mother had died leaving
her with no near relatives in the city
when her fathers old employers had
offered her a position she had taken
it gratefully
  in vain had she thrown herself vig-
orously into her work working longer
hours than the other reporters besides
attending a school of journalism in the
evening
   it was impossible it seemed for her
to get any one to take her seriously
everywhere she was just  dink it
seemed to her that she had never since
leaving school heard herself called by
her last name or been treated as though
she were a woman of twenty-four and
not an urchin of fourteen
because of her longing to make
good she had made one of the
night copy boys promise to phone
her at her boarding house whenever
anything big developed during the time
she grudgingly devoted to sleep it
was the copy boys call that had brought
her to the thornton home this morn-
ing and now that she was here she
reflected bitterly it was the same old
story
   on the third floor she searched about
for an opening that might lead to the
attic and at last found one in the roof
of the huge ophite-lined bathroom
   a table had been pulled into the room
and a chair placed upon it where evi-

argosy-allstory weekly
dently some detective had mounted to
inspect the attic
  dink climbed upon the table mount-
ed to the chair caught hold of the edge
of the opening and swung herself up
with an agility that would have amazed
the officers below could they have
seen it
   she was glad that they were not there
to see for they would have roared as
usual flash light in hand she quick-
ly discovered a door which led out upon
the roof it was indeed protected by
a burglar alarm device which had not
been disturbed and too dust around
the edge of the door showed that it
hadnt been opened for months
  after a thorough search of the attic
she was about to depart when she felt
a strand of her hair blow against her
face
- there were no windows in the attic
no discernible opening accounted for
the draft her heart hammering she
again searched the big gloomy place
this time traversing every inch of it
  suddenly in one corner she felt a
distinct draft looking about her in
all directions she could see no possible
source of a draft and then on im-
pulse she looked straight up there
in the side of a hollow ornamental
architrave was a hexagonal opening
large enough to admit a boy or small
man
  some one had apparently pulled off
a few slate shingles from the outside
and cut through the old wood beneath
without a moments delay she rushed
downstairs
  when she reached the room where
the body lay the men there were still
chatting and smoking dink said with
quiet intensity
   the murderer came from the skv
all right i found the hole in the roof
freshly made where he got in and out
   w-h-a-a-a-t it was the city
news association man who spoke
 what do you know about that and
all you guys missed it but nobody
was listening to him there was a
general exodus from the room toward
the stairs
  for several hours dink remained in
the house looking for further clews
but none developed finally she went
to the office to report to the city editor
which she was supposed to do at nine
oclock each morning
the minute she got into the city
room a boy told her that she was
wanted in the managing editors
office
  with a confident step she approached
the holy of holies where the  big
squeeze  sat incased grandly in frost-
ed glass the only editor in the office
to be so protected from the general
bedlam in the editorial rooms enter-
ing she stood by mr muldoons desk
silently without looking up at her he
said
   say dink im not riding you or
anything like that but when you do
get something you ought to give us a
break on it i understand you dis-
covered that hole in the roof that gave
the cops their only clew on the thorn-
ton case
   every paper in town had it through
the city news association as soon as
we had it we ought to have had sclu-
sive on that you ought to turn in a
little soviething for your dough old
kid when you do get it sall
  dink knew that when muldoon said
 sall the interview was definitely
ended and to prolong it particularly
with excuses was disastrous especially
as his  sall was an admonition to
himself not to let his quick temper get
the better of him as much as it was a
warning to his listener
  she could not have spoken anyway
her throat was tight and her eyes hot
she walked from the room silently
  but though she was near to tears
she was more determined than ever to
make good other new reporters were
not expected to make good for a year
or two after they were hired-but they
had all looked for something wonder-
out of the sky

ful from her right from the start and
when she didnt produce immediate vis-
ible pyrotechnics of some kind they had
decided that she hadnt inherited her
fathers  nose for news  which had
led him to unravel many a baffling case
which stumped the police
   all too well she knew that if she
 lost her job it would mean curtains in
 the newpaper business in that town for
 her for the rest of the editors would
 all say
    muldoon knows his business if
he couldnt put you over you better
get into some other game-the news-
paper game is no place for a lady any-
way
    smatter dink get bawled out
 the copy boys and rewrite men wanted
 to know as she walked out of the of-
 fice
    hey dink where you going to
work next week sang out a sob sister
from across the room
   with her head up dink hurried out
 and going back to her decrepit car at
 the curb returned to the vicinity of
 the thornton residence
   this time however she did not en-
 ter the thornton place for some time
 she sat at the curb in her car looking
 at the sky above the squat building in
 between two high apartment buildings
   she was thinking of the yard con-
 taining several alert police dogs the
 watchman the burglar alarms every-
 where and that hole in the roof
 the sky was clear and blue as though
 it were saying look theres noth-
 ing up my sleeve the area above the
 three-story residence was utterly guilt-
 less of anything that might have aided
 the murderer in alighting upon the
 roof
dink got down out of the car and
entered the apartment building to
the left of the thornton home
 it was a brand new rococo building
 having a lobby vile with pargetted walls
 and imitation anjemic-looking heppel-
 white chairs
   any one move out of here this
morning she asked the clerk eyed
her superciliously until she showed
him her police  courtesy  card after
that he admitted that a tenant had left
early in the morning and gave dink
a key to the recently vacated apart-
ment
   going upstairs alone she entered the
 apartment and went directly to the win-
 dow looking out she found herself
 looking down upon the thornton resi-
 dence that had been so perfectly
 guarded on all sides but which had
 been successfully attacked from the
 sky
   it was a fifth-floor apartment that
 she was in she could see almost all
 of the roof of the old residence in-
 cluding the cupola that had revealed
 its secret to her
   the lot was spacious so that the
 residence was not directly beneath the
 window at which she now stood it 
 would have been impossible for any
 one to let himself down upon the roof
 with a rope ladder or anything of that
 sort from either one of the apartment
 buildings
   she sympathized with the puzzle-
ment of the officers and their decision
according to the late morning editions
of the papers to try the old reliable
 questioning  of suspects they had
probably she surmised found and ar-
rested the other servants and were now
 questioning  them she shuddered
in disgust recalling unpleasant scenes
she had witnessed
   as she turned from the window she
 happened to glance at the fingers of
 the cotton gloves she wore they were
 covered with what looked like fine
 wood splinters the wall was of paint-
 ed cement and the window frame was
 of steel
   looking closely she saw that there
 was on each side of the window frame
 an almost imperceptible line of tiny-
 wood splinters like those upon her
 glove she called down to the clerk
 over the room telephone

argosy-allstory weekly
   tell me she said  did that man
who moved out of this apartment have
any unusual luggage
   yes came the prompt reply  a
long especially constructed trunk such
as theatrical people carry specially
vaudeville people for their own props
dink hung up the receiver and stood
very still for the first time in months
she was thoroughly happy though tired
almost to the point of exhaustion from
hunger and lack of sleep she knew
now why her father had often come
home dog-tired but with a happy tri-
umphant grin on his face
  impatiently she hopped into her car
and headed for the near-by business
section to get a bite to eat like the
sudden discovery of an artists child of
a feeling for the esthetic beyond what
other children have dink felt stirring
within her a strange something that
she knew was of her and dormant until
now
  like an intricate but efficient ma-
chine her mind tore at the problem
before her with amazing new vitality
she knew with ecstatic certainty that
it was the awakening within her of
her fathers strange faculties of deduc-
tion
with a new confidence and a
feeling of delightful elation she
hastily swallowed her lunch
   oh if i can only put this over
she breathed to herself  and find
something the rest cant and get my
name in the  scoop book  and maybe
convince mr muldoon that i have got
the stuff in me-so hell trust me on
big assignments
   a little wistfully in what might have
been called a sotto voce thought she
added to herself and maybe get
somebody once in awhile to call me
miss richards as though i were a real
person like dad  dink it had al-
ways seemed to her was rather a cruel
nickname in that it was so apropos
  after luncheon she returned to the
investigation trying the apartment
building to the left of the thornton
residence to her delight she found
that an apartment directly opposite the
one she had investigated previouslj
had been vacated that morning
  peering out of the window of this
apartment she saw that there was a
small space between the apartment
building and the high brick fence that
surrounded the thornton residence
  when she came out to the street
again it was well along in the after-
noon she started to walk around the
block in order to enter the alley be-
hind the buildings when she dis-
covered upon turning the corner that
wyatt a reporter from the daily
clarion a rival paper was following
her about half a block behind
  her heart almost stopped dead he
was she knew a new man in the city
who had not known her father other
reporters said that wyatt was the
 new type  of newspaper man to
whom the old traditions meant noth-
ing in a panic she wondered if he
had followed her into the apartment
building and ascertained from the clerk
what she had been doing
  she decided that he must not know
where she was going instead of en-
tering the alley she walked around the
block got into her flivver and drove
away before wyatt could hail a taxi
to follow her she had twisted in and
out of several blocks and completely
eluded him
  not until dark did she again return
to the vicinity of the murder wyatt
she supposed having heard about the
finding of the hole in the roof had de-
cided to follow her on the theory pos-
sibly that one good clew deserves an-
other and that in all likelihood the sec-
ond might be found by the person smart
enough to have located the first
  about nine oclock she parked her
car at the entrance to the alley and
with her electric torch entered the nar-
row aperture between the apartment
building and brick wall
  it was pitch dark in the narrow
out of the sky

opening and there was barely room for
her small as she was to squeeze along
she stepped over tin cans bricks and
impedimenta doubtless thrown from
the apartment building windows at
lyric cats
  when she was near the middle of
the passage between the wall and build-
ing her flash light glanced upon some
long sticks obviously new and strik-
ingly in contrast with the other debris
which was blackened and weather-
beaten and covered with dust
  she picked up one of the long thin
sticks and examined it at one end
was a little weight of lead and at the
other end a short length of heavy
thread
  stooping she reached to gather up
the other similar sticks that lay about
and then blackness fell on her there
was a tremendous crashing in her brain
-bright lights-a moment of sinking
through this crashing sparkling dark-
ness-then unconsciousness
after what seemed like an eterni-
 ty she heard a voice calling her
hey dink dink dink
she wished that the insistent voice
would stop tried to lapse into uncon-
sciousness again but the voice grew
louder
   dink dink i and then  god
the kids hurt bad cant you guys
find a rope or something
  dink sat up her head throbbed vio-
lently her cheeks was sore where she
had bruised it in falling she called up
   im all right now
  the man above on the top ofthe
brick fence flashed his light down into
the crevice she saw other faces beside
his on the fence top
  remembering the sticks she used her
own flash light to look for them-but
they were gone
   see if you can reach my hands
the man on the fence called down
  dink looking up saw that he was a
plainclothes man she had often met
while working on other cases the
crevice she was in was too narrow for
any of them to get down into she
stood on tiptoe and reaching up could
just barely grasp his hands as he leaned
over the edge of the fence other offi-
cers holding him from behind
  without difficulty once he had
grasped her hands the detective pulled
her to the top of the fence
  dink could hardly hold her head up
the cool night air atop the fence was
reviving but not half so reviving as
what one of the older officers was say-
ing
   by god dink you sure inherited
your old mans guts
   but what became of my sticks 
she asked
   the officers laughed
  we got your sticks and your man
they rushed him off to an outlying sta-
tion where a habeas corpus writ cant
reach him until they get something out
of him
  as dink rushed in her flivver to the
west side police station where the
officers had hidden their prisoner the
officers who had volunteered to accom-
pany her to see that they let her in ex-
plained 
   we was watching all around the
house saw you go into that slit be-
tween the building then this bird came
from across the alley and followed in
after you we lined up along the top
of the fence as soon as we could to
watch what was going on
   seen you find them sticks with your
flash light and then this bird hit you
before we could yell but we nailed
him right afterward pulled him out
and made him bring his sticks with
him you was only out for a minute
well get to the station almost as soon
as the prisoner does-the way youre
driving-that is if we dont get killed
-i got a wife and eight kids home
  and none of the other reporters
have wind of any of this she persist-
ed anxiously
   nope they been down at central
detail watching the boys sweat the

argosy-allstory weekly
servants they wont be able to find
out where we took the bird for some
time yet we only let you know be-
cause you really nailed him
   wasnt even the city news as-
sociation man there
    nope they all give it up i guess
except you youre like your old man
that way i guess youd find him pok-
ing around on a case long after every-
body else gave it up as hopeless
   like your old man the words
were balm to dinks soul
  arriving before an old frame po-
-lice station on the west side the
officer conducted dink downstairs
into the squad room by a back door
several officers had locked themselves
in the room with the prisoner but the
officer that accompanied dink saw that
she was admitted
   the prisoner a thin short rather
anaemic little man of forty-five or fifty
did not look like a criminal he looked
like a cornered marmoset determined to
die with as great expense to his cap-
tors as possible
   evidently he had been there for but a
few minutes as the officers questioned
him he uttered not a sound the kind
who wouldnt say anything at all were
more difficult dink knew than the kind
who talked and tangled themselves up
in a tissue of lies
   of course the man would eventually
confess there was no question about
that all things considered but if he
did not do so very shortly it would de-
cidedly interfere with the gorgeous
story dink was seeing in her minds
eye all spread on the first page
   perhaps if i jog the prisoners
memory a bit dink suggested and
knowing that her outlining of his ac-
tivities would surely shake his confi-
dence dismay him and convince him
probably that there was little use to
hold on she went on
   you rented a room in the alcazar
apartments you also rented an apart-
ment directly across the way in the
druder apartments on the same floor
as the apartment in the alcazar
   in one of the apartments you had
stored a quantity of rope in both you
had provided a heavy short timber to
brace across the steel window frames
in order to secure your rope
    last night some time after the ad-
vertising signs in the neighborhood
were turned off you shot an arrow
with a thread upon it across from one
window into the corresponding window
in the opposite apartment
   several times you missed and
pulled back the thread having tied a
short length of weaker thread to each
arrow so that it would break close to
the arrow if you missed and leave the
arrow out of sight down between the
brick fence and the apartment building
   when you finally did land an ar-
row in the window you went across
and pulled a heavier string between the
buildings-then your rope you se-
cured the rope to the timbers at each
end and then climbed out on the rope
to the center it sagged down upon
the roof of the thornton mansion you
got upon the roof noiselessly cut a
hole in the architraves of the cupola
and then-
   aw shut up the prisoner broke
in if id only walloped you harder
when i had you back there between the
building and the apartment house-or
if id had a chance to get those arrows
earlier-a frying is what im due for--
i	know it-ill plead and take my only
chance but i havent got any dough
so its probably all up with me lets
have it over with as soon as possible
  from that point on it was merely a
matter of fast stenographic copying
the man told everything willingly
he had been a vaudeville actor had
taken quarters at the alcazar years
before he had been in an act where
archery was featured and not all of his
old skill was gone
  he couldnt explain his descent to
crime after years of rectitude but he
 guessed he was worrying over the
out of the sky

fact that old age was coming on and
he hadnt saved anything
   reaching the newspaper office at
	am dink sat down and wrote her
story carefully and beautifully hoping
that it would be so flawless that the re-
write men would not hack it to pieces
if she wrote right up to the minute
when it would be necessary to slap the
story onto the linos in order to make
the morning edition she only did what
her father had often chuckled over do-
ing
the following morning dink woke
up with a splitting head there
was a lump as large as an egg to
testify to the fact that she had not
dreamed about her scoop
   she sprang out of bed and dressed
hurriedly she had had only five
hours sleep but she would he abed no
longer what she asked herself in
panic if after all she had bungled
somewhere and the other papers had
got the story too then probably
muldoon would fire her for not having
told him what was going on so he could
have it properly covered by a veteran
   after dressing speedily she hurried
to the corner and bought an early
edition of her paper there was her
story word for word as she had written
it under the streamer and head
reporter solves murder mystery
thornton killed by actor he surprised
rifling jewel snfe
  though she was almost afraid to
look at them she bought all the other
morning papers there was no word
in them concerning the clearing up of
the crime
   somehow she still couldnt believe
that it had all worked out so beauti-
fully something whispered to her
that even yet there would prove to be a
fly in the ointment
   getting her flivver from the garage
she drove down to the office
  when she entered the doorman
greeted her with a respectful
   morning miss richards-some
story
   an awed copy boy said as she passed
him
   hlo din-ah-miss richards
muldoon wansta see you
  with a sinking heart she hurried
into muldoons office as usual that
individual let her stand silently beside
his desk for a length of time suf-
ficient to squelch her completely fi-
nally he said
    why didnt you hand that story to
a rewrite man to be written up proper-
ly think youre a writer dink
quavered
    no sir-but you see there wasnt
time to get-
   oh for heavens sake dont
pull that on an old timer like me i
know where you learned that stunt all
right all right you deliberately de-
layed your copy to the deadline so it
couldnt be rewritten
  dink blushed there was a mo-
ments silence as he scowled at her
guilty flush and then
    hereafter write all your own stuff
whenever theres time-if you dont
have to phone it in against a deadline
-unnerstan  but be careful-if
you make em all like that story was
youll make the rest of the staff around
here look sick you evidently got
your fathers feel for slinging words
as well as his gall about doing the
police departments work for them on
the papers time
  and hereafter doni go butting
your head around where youll get it
knocked off get your assignments
direct from me
   yes sir she squealed meekly as
was proper before the mighty mul-
doon
   sall he finished ferociously feel-
 ing the impulse within him to say more
 and trying to stop himself take
 the day off to rest up
   she started for the door but sud-

denly he called her back against all of
his better judgment
   how much are you getting now
din-ah miss richards
    forty a week sir but its all right
if youll just call me miss richards
once in awhile as though i were a real
person and give me honest-to-goodness

broken or not i dont care if you give
me no more increase in wages for the

   who said i was going to give you

the foe of the ants
he common ant-eating toad of the arid portions of the southwest is gradu-
ally retreating before the advent of man curiously enough the chief
agency of this decimation is the automobile the toad had a chance to scurrv
out from under the wagon wheels of the old days but the auto is too swift
and its wheels take a heavy toll on the desert roads in a single mile an auto
may slay half a dozen of these harmless and useful reptiles being very-
clumsv the toad eagerly seeks smooth surfaces as the dry ruts of roads and
they are consequently slain by the thousands
     one unfortunate result of the passing of the toad is the increase of ants
which are its chief food not only the ubiquitous red ant but what is worse
a species of thesoldier ant which is actually dangerous to human life the
red ant is sufficiently well known particularly by picnickers it is annoying
but not dangerous the soldier ant is a different creature altogether and
although it is not so formidable as its cousin in the amazon basin it is well
to steer clear of it as it knows only one kind of tactics to attack anything and
everything without ever giving up
    some years ago a young couple went on a camping trip by way of a
honeymoon after a long trek they came to a dry arroyo on the west side
of the san joaquin and being tired they decided to camp and rest shortly
they were asleep ignorant of the fact that they were lying next door to a big
hive of soldier ants
     not long after a cowboy after strays happened along he might have 
passed on attending strictly to his own business but for some incoherent
moanings that issued from the campers tent fearing that something was
wrong he decided to investigate the young people were literally covered
with the black and ferocious soldier ants which were already well started eat-
ing away the tender tissue around mouths eyes noses and ears the victims
moaned and made feeble signs of distress but seemed unable to awaken nor
could the cowboy awaken them they were got to a hospital where it took
days to restore them to full consciousness nobody has fully explained how
the ants go about chloroforming their victims but it is clear they are dangerous

thet i didnt hev no water rights nd
i figgered thet it warnt no use atall to
try to raise dried beef on th hoof i
decided then thet what i wanted next
was a job without no responsibilities
attached to it nd i become a cow-poke
nd ive been one ever since gettin my
forty per nd all found
  yes sir a man kin shape his
own destiny as th feller says if he
uses is mind thet is added mr
teagle  if he keeps away from th in-
fluence of wimmin
  mr teagle when he had concluded
his peroration looked at me challeng-
ing from under the rim of his bat-
tered sombrero and not wishing to
disappoint him i asked the question
that he expected
   why must an ambitious man keep
away from the influence of women if
he wishes to be successful i queried
 i always supposed snoozer that a
man could and his greatest inspiration
in a woman i have always heard
that a woman could be a mans greatest
help in climbing up fhe steep path that
leads to the bright and shining goal of
success
  mr teagle stoop-shouldered and
weather-beaten looked at me wdth con-
tempt in bis pale-blue eyes as though he
were pitying my deplorable lack of
knowledge of the ways of women 
    it aint so he said positively  nd
i kin prove it concioosively
   why he added  ive seen men
change thar very natures nd then-
he shook his head dubiously
  th feller im talkin about he
continued  is name was sorrel sim-
mons nd he used to ride range with me
up in idaho he was out follerin
some strays wunst up in th hills nd
he picked up a funny lookin piece of
rock thet was heavy nd gray nd shiny
he brought it back to th ranch house
nd showed it around nd some one told
im it was galena or somethin nd thet
he ought to locate a mining claim so
sorrel put up is stakes nd up nd sells
his lead prospect fer ten thousand
dollars which to im was a good-size
fortune
    with all of thet money in th bank
of cose sorrel quit is job nd settled
in packsaddle which was a town near
the cross y-x th range we hed been
workin on sorrel hed been to school
wunst or maybe twict nd he hed a
hankerin fer what he called th finer
things of life so he buys imself a
accordeon a mail order suit a pair of
bright yeller shoes with bulldog toes a
correspondence cose in  how to be a
detective nd a lot of little five cent
books called classics
    after he put on th suit nd th
shoes he sat dowrn nd tried to learn to
play th accordeon th coyotes come
from miles around whenever he tried
to play thinkin thet one of thar long-
lost brethern was acallin to them fer
help
    sorrel after awhile quit tryin to
be a musician nd he found out too
continued mr teagle  thet he
couldnt be a detective in packsaddle
because thar warnt nothin thar to de-
tect nd besides even when he hed
his false whiskers on everybody knew
im by is yeller shoes
    then i reckon he looked over th
little books thet he hed ordered nd out
of all of em he only found one thet
intrested him he must a fixed is un-
divided attention as th feller says on
thet thar book because he shore ab-
sorbed it plenty i used to ride into
town once in awhile to pass th time of
day with sorrel nd on one of these
occasions i found im in is cabin read-
in it nd lookin thoughtful-like
  yo look sorrel says i as
though yod come acrost a monstrous
two-syllable word in thet thar pondr-
ous tome if yoll spell out th letters
fer me ill tell you what it means
     do vo know snoozer he says in
a solemn voice  thet th human mind
is a wonderful thing nd thet a feller
what ropes nd breaks it nd what rides
it proper kin go gallopin on it into
fame nd fortune all yo got to do is
                            	a
will power in packsaddle

to use yore will-power he says en-
thusiasticlike  yo jest hev to con-
centrate on what od like to be yo
gota sorta picture how vod like to be
like nd then jest keep on thinkin thet
yore like it after awhile without
yo ever knowin it yo git thet way
jest by usin yore will-power snoozer
yo kin come to domineer other people
what dont use thar intellects yo kin
make money win th love nd affections
of females nd even git to be sales
manager he says
    sales manager of what i asks
    why of anything i reckon he
tells me  whats th diffrence any-
way he asks irritatedlike a sales
managers a sales manager aint he no
matter what hes of thet aint th
idee nohow he tells me  yo dont
hev to be no sales manager if yo dont
wanta yo kin be anythin atall
nd it all comes outa th sub-rosa
mind which accordin to this hyar
book is plumb full of power nd mag-
netics now me says sorrel who
was a runty bow-legged watery-eyed
little gent  ive got plenty of fame nd
fortune but i shore would like to git
more nervy an scrappylike id like
to git sos i could stand up to hard
rock mcmulligan nd look im straight
in is ugly mug nd call im a wall-eyed
hawse-thief
    if vo ever do thet i says to sor-
rel  yo wont hev no haid left to keep
yore sub-rosa brains in
    oh i dont know about thet
says sorrel pertlike  onless yove
read this hyar book yo cant never
realize th amazin power of the mind
    i snickered to myself when i was
ridin back thet evenin towad th
cross y-x at th thought of little sor-
rel simmons standin up nd callin
names to hard rock mcmulligan be-
cause plard rock was a gent thet
didnt let nobody cast no aspersions nor
nothin else on im he was ridin
range at thet time but he had got is
muscles drivin back holes with a six-
teen pound double-jack nd carrying
    	a
twelve-by-twelve stulls up ladderways
in mines
   pie wasnt a bad feller hard rock
wasnt but neither is a grizzly bar if
yo dont rile im up i reckon thet
mcmulligan was even sorry at times
thet he was so strong and that he
stirred up so much trouble when he
went on a jamboree i guess too
thet he was afraid thet some day he
might lay some one out cold without
ever meanin to do it
   anyway th next time i rode into
packsaddle i found thet th whole
town was intrested in this hyar will-
power busness nd thet sorrel sim-
mons nd hard rock mcmulligan was
crazier about it than all of th others
put together sorrel  learned hed
been spreadin th glad tidins of how
any gent could be whatever sorta
hombre hed like to be nd accordin to
th talk thet was goin on in th water
hole saloon most of th people in th
town hed a yearnin to make them-
selves all over
   i was plumb surprised to see sorrel
nd hard rock leanin agin th bar to-
gether like two ol pardners because
usually mcmulligan didnt do nothin
but pester sorrel nigh to death
    im right glad thet i happened to
know yo sorrel i heered hard rock
sayin as i walked up to th bar  nd
i shore appreciate yo makin me ac-
quainted with this hyar will-power
stuff i git too plumb riotous now nd
then but i never knowed jest how to
git around ft
    i kin see easy though thet all
ive gota do is to think all th time thet
im a quiet nd peaceful gent in order
to git all of thet cantankerousness outa
my system its jest as easy to do as it
is to fall offen a hawse thets sun-
fishin
    ive been thinkin already fer a
coupla days nd i kin feel a change
creepin over me even now i reckon
thet im through struttin around look-
in fer trouble like i used to do in by-
gone days

argosy-allstory weekly
   i reckon says sorrel sorta
straightenin up  thet im goin to
change some too im figgerin i am
on makin myself into a gent thet dont
take nothin from no one thar aint
no reason why i caint he says  ive
got kinda tired of bein picked on nd

ignerent of th power of th mind
      ive been thinkin too fer a few
days hard rock nd i kin feel

im a tough he-man i am but th
trouble has been thet i havent realized

its a marvelous thing this will-power
stuff he says
    it is thet agreed hard rock
gentle-like  yore a good feller sor-
rel nd im proud to be one of yore
friends
   i sat around with sorrel in is
cabin thet afternoon fer a little while
nd he asked me if i could make up
some little verse for im to keep repeat-
in to imself he knew thet i had a
kinda talent fer rhymin because i
used to write little poems about th fel-
lers in th outfit
    he wanted to keep on tellin im-
self thet he was a tough gent nd he
said he needed a coupla lines of verse
thet would keep runnin through is
mind automaticlike i made up a lot
of em fer sorrel but none of em
seemed to suit im but th last one i
struck which went somethin like this
        im a gent what people fears
       if i hit a guy he disappears
   i didnt like thet one as well as i
did some of th others but sorrel said
thet it jest suited im he was mum-
blin it to imself when i left im nd
started back to th ranch i went to
town in about another week nd hard
rock mcmulligan gets me in a corner
     im doin fine says he  with th
 will-power stuff but i wish mr
 teagle please thet yod make me up a
 little verse like yo did fer sorrel
   i could see thet hard rock was
progressin all right because as far as
i knowed he never in is life before
said please to no one nor never called
no one mister
      shore ill make up a little verse
for yo hard rock i says nd i sat
down in th water hole saloon and
after scratchin my haid fer a minute
i got jest what i wanted  hows
thet hard rock i asked him when i
handed it to im when it was all written
down he picked it up nd read it
sorta slow-like
        i am humble meek and mild
        like a gentle little child
       thets jest th thing he told me
nd with thet he picked a twenty-dollar
gold piece outa is pocket nd handed
it to me i didnt wanta take it but
he wouldnt hev it no other way
 thets real potry snoozer he says
 nd i reckon thet i know what its
wuth i am humble meek and mild
like a gentle little child thets me
snoozer he asseverates  thets jest
what i wanta be yo wont see me
fracasin around no moe
   it seemed then continued mr
teagle  thet everybody in packsaddle
wanted a verse sos they could go
around atalkin to themselves nd i sat
in th water hole saloon all th after-
noon makin em up nd collectin
twenty bucks apiece for em ive for-
gotten most of em it bein a long time
ago but i do recollect one or two of
them verses
    i did one fer bill mongrain th
grocer nd it went this way
    when im weighin spuds or nails
   i keep my fingers off th scales
   nd i wrote one fer pat hurley
who owned the water hole it went
this way
    maybe sometimes i git frisk
 ut i dont put water in my whisky
   when i went ridin back to th
ranch thet night lhed nearly three hun-
will power in packsaddle

dred dollars in my pockets nd i was
thinkin serious of takin up potry fer
a perfession
ii
    it was a coupla weeks before i got
 into packsaddle agin but when i did
 i saw a sight thet id never thought id
 live to see i was ridin into town
 when i sees sorrel walkin down th
 street nd i pulls in my hawse nd hails
 im  hi thar sorrel i hollers
  hows yore ol bow laigs 
    he looks around nd glares at me
 nd ill swear thet i hardly knowed im
 when he come swaggerin in my direc-
 tion  listen snoozer he says to me
 outa one corner of is mouth when he
 gits close to me  im mr simmons
 now to most of th people in this hyar
 town but seein thet weve knowed
 each other fer a considrable length of
 time i reckon yo kin call me sorrel
     but it aint healthy no more fer
 people around hyar to mention my laigs
 onless i bring th subject up fust dye
 understand cow-poke
    sorrel looked as mad as a rattler
 jest ready to strike but at fust i
 thought thet he was jest makin be-
 lieve
     shore mr simmons i savvy i
 tells im soberlike  but jest fer ol
 times sake i says  i kin look at yore
 laigs once in awhile caint i nd try to
 figger out if a freight train reely could
 run between em
    th next minute i shore was a-
 sweatin went on snoozer teagle
  because i was lookin plumb down
 the centers of two gun-barrels  id
 drill yo snoozer sorrel tells me
 coldly only im sorry fer yo nd i
 reckon yo aint been warned thet im
 through with all th nonsense of yo
 fellers
yo aint been in town fer two
weeks snoozer nd yo dont know
thet thar has been considrable of a
change around hyar i aint afraid of
no man on earth no more snoozer nd
im lavin down th law in packsaddle
  im a gent what people fears snoozer
  if i hit a guy he disappears
     i still thought thet sorrel was fun-
 nin me but i hed heerd tell of gents
 goin crazy nd i wasnt goin to take no
 chances  i know thet yore a bad
 hombre sorrel i says tryin to keep
 from laffin  nd bein a peaceful sorta
 feller myself i aint honin fer no trou-
 ble ill never mention laigs agin sor-
 rel onless im speakin about centipedes
 or somethin like thet
     sorrel puts is guns back in is hol-
 sters  i thought yod listen to reason
 snoozer he says  because yo aint a
 bad feller atall in spite of th fact thet
 your inverted sense of humor is lible
 to git yo into trouble come nd hev
 a drink with me he orders  nd well
 fergit this little temperory unpleasant-
 ness
    so we went to the water hole nd
 i took notice thet every one thar treated
 sorrel with due respect nd deference
 as th feller says th bar was sorta
 crowded but two or three gents seein
 sorrel stepped outa th line nd went
 nd set at a table nd let us take thar
 places  what  it be mr simmons
 asked pat hurley  th same as al-
 ways says sorrel nd hard rock
 hyar is goin to hev one with me too

 in right next to sorrel with a sorta
 meek grin on is face thanks a lot
 sorrel he says ill be proud to drink
 with yo nd yore friend mr teagle
    th drinks was served continued
 snoozer teagle  nd i was about to
 hist mine down whenall of a suddeni
 hear sorrel speak up sharp nd irritable-
 like what dye mean by jiggling my
 elbow hard rock he asks  yonigh
 made me spill my liquor hard rock
 sorta flushed as sorrel glared at im
 	im sorry sorrel he says  i shore
didnt mean to shove yo like i did i
was lookin th other way nd i didnt
see what i was doin
   but sorrel kept on lookin at im

     i rods back to th cross y-z thet
evenin said snoozer teagle  pon-
derin on what i hed seen with my own
eyes nd doin a powerful lota wonder-
in about it i was busy fer th next
few weeks in th round-up nd i didnt
git into packsaddle atall i heerd tell
though thet sorrel simmons was rid-
in th town like a buster rides a bronc
nd thet hard rock mcmulligan was
gettin so peaceful-like thet he was
scared when he met up with a jack-rab-
bit nd i heerd also rumors concernin
a new school-teacher thet hed come to
packsaddle to teach th young idee to
shoot i got to reckonin too thet this
sally lovering person must be consid-
rable of a looker because th fellers
thet hed seen her couldnt agree no-
how as to what she looked like
   one gent comes back to th cross
y-z nd swears thet she is a tall blonde
with eyes like azurite while another as-
severates- thet she is a little dark-eyed
brunette another hombre said thet
she hed hair th color of native copper
nd thet she wasnt neither tall nor
short but jest about medium but they
all sighed deep nd frequent when they
mentioned er so i finally reckoned thet
id ride into packsaddle nd see er my-
self
 so one day i did go lopin into
will power in packsaddle

town nd when i was ridin past the
schoolhouse she was out playin with
th kids she looked up at me nd
smiled nd i raised my hat nd bowed
nd said  good afternoon maam it
was only th middle of th mawnin too
but i didnt think of thet until after-
ward
   i sorta hung around packsaddle th
rest of th day tryin to git another look
at th school-marm but th only people
i saw was everybody else but her i
met up with sorrel simmons of cose
nd he looked jest like this hyar pitcher
of napoleon whar he has is hand stuck
in th front of is coat
   i saw hard rock mcmulligan too
nd he greets me as mr teagle nd
bows to me perlitelike i heerd thet
every one in town was still exercisin
great will power nd thet all of th
hombres were in love with this sally
lovering gal but thet none of them
but sorrel simmons would admit it
sorrel made up fer all th rest because
he went around savin thet he was goin
to win er nd marry er in no time atall
   when i got into th bunk house
thet night th fust thing th boys asked
me was whether i hed seen er nd jest
what she looked like
     of cose i seen er i told em
 nd i know jest what she looks like
she has i says  a very nice smile nd
her eyes are-well her eyes are most
salubrious to look at nd er hair i
says  is a shade somewhere right be-
tween a golden color nd black nd it
has i reckon a tinge of copper in it
when th sun shines on it
    her figger i says  would do
credit to any mans assefe nd as fer er
height shes a little bit taller than she
is short when shes wearin shoes with
high heels on em if vo hombres was
observin like i am i says  i wouldnt
hev to be tellin yo all of these hyar
things nd then i walked out on em
tryin to remember jest what thet sally
gal did look like
    i didnt rightly find out though
continued snoozer teagle  ontil i
went to th dance thet was given in
packsaddle after th round-ups thar-
abouts were all over nd th cattle ship-
ments hed been made th jamboree
was held in th hall over th water hole
nd every one was thar from miles
around thet included me too because
i liked to dance in them days nd i was
some two-stepper i was i was dressed
up proper fer th affair too with new
chaps silver-inlaid spurs nd a red silk
bandanna thet cost me three bucks nd
six bits i hed a new stetson too nd
th only thing thet i regretted was thet
i couldnt wear thet hat when i was
dancin
   thet sally lovering person was th
belle of th ball all right nd after i
hed been thar a little while i got my-
self introdooced to er jest as i was
makin a low bow th music strikes up
 shall we shake a laig in this hyar
dance maam i asks she kinda
smiled a little and then held out er arms
nd we started to gallivant around
      didnt i see yo ridin past th
schoolhouse a few weeks ago she asks
me after a bit  yo did maam i
admitted  but i didnt wanta ride
past maam i told her  when i saw
yo i wanted to git right offen my
hawse nd play with yo nd th rest
of th kids she blushed a little nd
called me a flatterer nd i sorta felt
right then thet she likes me

tryin to make yoreself over by will-
power like th rest of th men in pack-
saddle she asks me after awhile with
a pretty little giggle  maam says i

usin my mind fer one thing
  she looks kinda disappointed
 weat hev yo been usin it fer she
asks  ive been usin it maam i
tells er  to think about yo with nd

   she blushed agin nd laughed a
little nd looked at me with sorta wan-
derin eyes  i aint no apostle of

rock mcmulligan nd sorrel simmons

nd i dont reckon i want to be one
likewise i adds  i aint got no desire
to be no john l sullivan jest at pres-
ent im jest plain snoozer teagle cow-
poke nd thets all
   they make me laugh most of
these men in packsaddle she said
 with all of this will-power stuff thet
little red-haided fellow with th bow
laigs thet every one calls sorrel walks
around town as if he was a whole army
he dont look any more like a lighter
than a canary bird looks like a cannon
but every one seems to be afraid of im
    nd thet mcmuiligan person she
sniffs  hes as big nd as hard as th
side of a mesa nd he goes around look-
in nd talkin like a parson id like
to bet somethin pretty thet those gents
aint changed permanent she tells me
in thet soft voice of ers  maam i
replies  id take up yore bet only i
aint got nothin thets wuth even the
prettiness of yore little finger not to
speak of all th rest of yo
   th music stopped jest then re-
lated snoozer teagle  nd while we
were applaudin fer an oncore i saw
sorrel standin in a corner of th hall
glarin at me
    werent yo th one mr teagle
she says when we were dancin agin
	thet wrote th potry thet all of these
people  in packsaddle go around re-
citin to themselves she smiled at me
as sweet as sweet nd i started in throw-
in in a double-shuffle with my left foot
once in awhile  i was miss lover-
ing i tells er nd then i got sorta bold-
like all of a sudden
    what would yo do maam i
asks er if i was to call yo sally
she jest looked at me nd smiled a little
 why she says  i believe thet i
would call yo snoozer although i
caint figger whar yo got sich a name
yo dont seem to be half as much
asleep as lots of men ive met in pack-
saddle i like potry snoozer she then
tells me  nd i shore do admire them
gifted people who kin turn it out like
yo do
     its a payin perfession i told er
 i made three hundred dollars in one
afternoon by writin them verses
    i wish snoozer she says  thet
i was goin to hev th next dance with
yo but i promised it to thet thar little
sorrel feller or-lets see-was it to
thet hard rock mcmuiligan person
she frowned a little as she tried to re-
member which of them two hombres
hed roped er in fer the next trot
    why she says  i do believe thet
i promised it to both of em i was
lookin at yo so much snoozer nd
wonderin so much if yo was goin to
ever come and ask me to dance with
yo thet i guess i must a got sorta
confused about th other men
   right then i wanted to hev every
dance with er asserted snoozer
teagle  but i knowed thet thet warnt
possible  wal i says with a sorta
sigh yoll hev to keep yore promise
nd let one of th two of em hev th
next dance but dont fergit me after
thet sally especially when th band
starts playin  home sweet home 
    i wont snoozer she says with
a smile squeezin my arm a little then
th music stops nd i takes er over to
whar th chairs are nd i sits down with
er to wait ontil er next pardner comes
for her
   it warnt long continued snoozer
 before both sorrel simmons nd
hard rock mcmuiligan come walkin
over nd they both stop in front of
sally lovering nd bow to er  i
reckon th next dance with yo is mine
maam says sorrel to sally  the
next dance i believe is mine miss
lovering remarks hard rock right
after im
   th gal seemed kinda flustered
said snoozer  with them two gents
standin in front of er nd both of em
claimin th same dance  im sorry
she tells em  thet i got confused nd
promised each of yo th next dance
it was all my fault she admits  nd
i dont know what to do about it th
best thing i guess is for yo to decide
will power in packsaddle

between yo which one will be my pard-
ner im agreeable to dance with either
of yo
    thank yo miss lovering says
sorrel with a grin  fer leavin it up
to us two hombres to settle yo kin
figger thet ill be yore next pardner
    this hard rock gent hyar is a no-
account sick coyote nd hell admit thet
to yo imself he aint fitten to shuf-
fle with no lady if yo want to give
im a dance fer th sake of sweet char-
ity miss lovering i spose it  be all
right but if he hangs around whar
he aint wanted nd pesters or annoys
yo ill drop on im like a wildcat
    why im sure says sally lover-
ing  thet i dont want yo to start no
trouble mr simmons
    he wont maam i heerd hard
rock mcmulligan sorta growl nd
lookin at im i got plumb scared all
th gentleness nd mildness thet hed
been in is face fer so many weeks hed
disappeared nd he looked jest like th
same ugly mug only even worser then
he hed been before he hed commenced
to practice thet thar will power stuff
   i saw thet sorrel simmons was
lookin at hard rock too nd i kept
my eyes on sorrel kinda fascinated-
like because he seemed to be changin
is whole appearance right in front of
me he hed been struttin around fer
a long time as straight up nd down
as a royal flush but with mcmulligan
glarin at im in is old way sorrel
seemed to cave in around th middle
   he got kinda limp like a biled
shirt bein rained on explained
snoozer teagle  all of thet cock-
sureness seemed to be leakin outa is
face nd he stood thar lookin as if he
was seein a ghost but even then he
didnt lose all of is faith in is will
power nd he perks up fer a minute nd
looks insolent-like at iiard rock  say
yo he commenced  ill-
    shet up yo pussy cat says mc-
mulligan nd he says it in sich a voice
thet sorrel gits so scared thet he jest
caint talk no more  i feel sorta sick
i do goes on hard rock speakin to
sorrel  when i figger what ive been
tryin to make outa myself hyar ive
been goin around convincin myself
thet i was a meek and mild sorta gent
what didnt wanta fight nd what
couldnt fight if he did
    ive been kotowin to an in-
significant little runt with red hair nd
bow laigs why i even let yo call me
a wall-eyed hawse thief says hard
rock turnin sorta red at th memory
nd seemin to git madder every minute
nd i might a kept on bein thet way
he sorta moaned  if it hadnt been fer
my regard fer a lady-
iv
  snoozer teagle paused sighed
dolefully and then cleared his throat
  wal thets what happens to a
man he continued  when he gits is
aims nd ambitions mixed up with a
dame if sorrel simmons hed been
able to use is will power a little longer
without losin faith in it all of a sud-
den he might hev become a real fighter
why he might even hev become presi-
dent of these hyar united states
 if hard rock mcmulligan hed
kept on believin thet he was a weak
nd inoffensive little feller he might
ave died of measles or whoopin cough
instead of passin out with a skin full
of bullets down in tonopah i always
hev to laugh though added snoozer
 when i think of how hard rock took
after sorrel thet night of th dance nd
nearly chased im clean outa th state
of idaho
   what became of sally lovering
snoozer i asked
   thets jest what i was goin to tell
yo replied mr teagle  id been
readin considrable litrachoor them

lars fer writin verses i figgered thet

horse sense
for want of a nail the shoe was lost -and for want of a pump cylinder head at
a dinky little desert stop a busy railroads entire freight schedule faced a tie-up
 by leo lee
it was out on that part of the line
called the  ash pan division
where the road cuts across dusty
desert as you know
  some call it the  hundred mile
drink for it is exactly one hundred
miles and nine inches between natural
watering stations so a clerk in the
engineers department told me one day
when we smuggled him into the tail
end of the fast freight on his fishing
vacation and slowed down to three
miles an hour so that he could get his
duffle between red horse and yelling
woman where the best trout bit
  but that was not on the dusty
desert i want you to understand right
here
  dusty desert why stranger that
place is some dry as i just remarked
it is several indian sleeps and nine
inches between engine drinks
  but an engine like a kentuckian
has to have water once in awhile so we
rigged up a tank at mallard drilled a
hole in the dryness and somehow got
a feeling of wetness down nearer
hades than mallard is or rather was
for mallard is no more
  how in thunder they came to name
a place out in that dust flat after a
duck is one too many for me but mal-
lard she was and she was the only
water to be had for many a turn of
the wheel
  now that was an important station
mallard was you see if anything
happened to the pump works at mal-
lard then the road had to haul the water
in tank cars run it onto a side track

   a snappy little man started along the platform to look at the pump 

argosy-allstory weekly
and then pump those engine chasers
from the tanks on the track to the big
iron tank on legs up above some job
that
  they used to have a wooden tank at
mallard but after it went dry for two
whole days once and fell to pieces the
great wisdom concealed about head-
quarters erected a special flask of boiler
iron at mallard
  as i said before mallard was a
mighty important point on the line i
was there and it got mighty lone-
some sometimes
  i used to josh over the wire with a
fair-haired maiden over at rock
cross even if it was against orders
for a man cannot talk to himself and
the looking-glass all the time can he
i forgot the office cat but she eloped
in the maw of a mr coyote one moon-
lit night and i did not have even her
to chat with
  so i opened tip a tick-tack conversa-
tion with the girl up the line but i quit
that after i found  she  smoked a
corncob pipe wore red whiskers and
was overburdened with a trifling dis-
position
  i risked it after pumping the tank
full to the top and got into the baggage
car and went up the line to lick that
hybrid good and plenty but he was six
feet three into the clouds and shut off
about a yard of the horizon with his
shoulders so i did not tell him who
i was and came back on the next
train
  and to think i had talked three
solid evenings with that over whether
he should wear baby blue or salmon
pink for his wedding dress i tell you
there are some mighty hard things to
bear in this world and red whiskers
on your promised bride are catalogued
among the flints of eate
  so i went back to tending bar for
engines at mallard and hunted cock-
roaches with the office ruler and a wet
sock between pumps and trains
  then something happened the
cylinder head of the pump broke
square in two and she squirted water
in great shape but not one drop could
she lift into the iron tank
  i had water enough to last through-
out the day but i left that broken-
hearted-i mean headed-pump strict-
ly alone and wired into the great wis-
dom and you should have seen what
i drew
  a pure white filler in a poker game
even if there were two dollars on the
table was nothing to it lace boots
real engineer just got loose out of
college he examined that pump like
a broken leg and pronounced it out of
action
  i knew that before i sent for him
but how was that to get wetness up
above besides he sprained my only
monkey wrench taking off the broken
cylinder head and ran away with it
when pat jorden pulled in with the
california freight
there i was with a perfectly good
pump except its cylinder head was
attached to a person with a diplo-
ma and i was just a common short-
horn ossified upstairs kept in solitary
confinement at mallard in charge of
dampening the top of locomotive fire-
boxes
  i looked at it and wondered pres-
idents wifes second cousin probably
anyway there he sat with that pump
head and my job in a sack at his feet
and i wanted them both out
  the only virtue i could see in that fel-
low was that he doubled the population
of mallard so as i had a report to fill
out on the increase of settlers along the
road i went in and filled it out ac-
cordingly
  it was the best chance i would have
probably so i took it before he got
away
  anyway mr diploma finally pulled
out on number seven with about one-
third the water i had left that left
me alone on the dusty desert without
even a pump to love and i have never
spoken to red whiskers since i was up
horse sense

there and i let him pound his key till
his engagement finger got tired
  pretty soon i heard an order go
over the wire to hitch tank cars to all
trains crossing dusty desert and i
knew what that meant
  the road had a scheme so that they
could pump water from a tank car right
behind the tender into the tender itself
and these traveling water tanks were
held in reserve at smiths center in
case anything went wrong with the
desert pumps
  there were other dry stations be-
sides mine remember for mallard was
not the only dewless city on the map
by any means
  then i heard some more wire con-
versation about changing train time
and the grouch away off somewheres
above high pine sent in an awful roar
about having some engines grabbed
from his division mallard was sure
some important station it seems
  and i was the whole citizenship of
that highly discussed burg yet no one
so far had sent me even a whisper
  then a click-click went by to a pump
company somewhere in ohio i went
out and looked at the lettering on my
pump and i knew that wire was about
my pump head sure enough
  same size and they were to hurry
it along by express p d q as the
lack of that pump head was raising
cain with the road evidently
  pretty soon in an hour or two
came back the answer from that ohio
concern saying that they had none in
stock had discontinued that size pump
it was a special order anyway and
they would have to cast one could
deliver in about two weeks
  i can see at this point where the
big think in the central office laid right
down on the carpet and had a fit
  that pump head was going to cost
the road some thousands of dollars
for we were short of tank cars with
those extra load-whiie-you-run pumps
on them and it was right in the middle
o the big haul too with grain pouring
in on the road like a hundred rivers of
threshed yellow
so i went out to look for the last
time at the pump for i knew
what would come traveling over
the wire for me soon as those ivory
nobs in headquarters got around to it
number three stopped at midnight
and i expected to take it also the last
of our water in the big tank
  the pump was all right except it
would not pump cousin had left the
bolts and nuts and even the wrench on
the floor for me to do with as i pleased
  so i took the ax and a clinch bar
and pried up a plank from the plat-
form i hacked the plank into four
pieces about tevo feet long each they
were eight-inch plank by the way
  then i put the poker in the office
stove and fired up and as soon as that
poker was red hot i burned a hole
through one end of one of those short
planks
  the poker cooled off before i got
even halfway through but i kept play-
ing at my little game of solitaire and
finally about sunset had all four pieces
of planking nicely drilled through
  and somehow the holes in them
when the planks were put two cross-
wise and two up-and-down over the
open end of that pump cylinder some-
how those burned holes were just in
line with the bolt holes in the pump it-
self then i put in a piece or two of
rubber blanket between the wood and
the iron and screwed her up fairly
tight
  i had a head to my pump cylinder
even if it was of wood i turned on
the power slowly and she leaked a
good deal but i got some water up into
the tank all right-about a barrel or
so maybe
  but the pump just kept on leaking
so i unscrewed her and took a good-
sized hole out of that rubber blanket
inner sheet that let the water
through right into the wood i figured
and she would swell tight in time so

argosy-allstory weekly
i screwed her up again and began to
pump slowly
   water spurted like there was a fire
company round somewhere but in
about an hour she began only to
drizzle and pretty soon stopped en-
tirely except for a drop now and then
from the wet wood
   i	filled the big tank shut down the
pump piled a wet comforter and a
rubber blanket over the wooden head
of the pump and sat downfor a smoke
pretty soon it came i wras to
take the midnight back to the big
town and was laid off for two
weeks
    what for  i ticks back
   pump out of commission you
idiot you no good there and i
knew red whiskers was cutting in
listening till he would split an ear so
it was with satisfaction i wired back
  pump fixed tank full plenty
of water
   pump cant be fixed cylinder
head here in office you fired come
in and i knew they thought i was
either drunk or was guying them and
you know what that means up in rail-
road heaven
   so i did not answrer but went to bed
along in the night she was late i
guess i heard the midnight stop for a
drink and later toot as she rounded
sand drift two miles away her
voice was not a lit husky either
  two more trains had their chasers
out of the officially empty tank and
about noon next day when our crack
passenger stopped a snappy sawed-off
little bear of a man crawled off the
rear car and started along the plat-
form to look at the pump i guess
  anyway he never got there for he
put his leg through that hole in the
platform w-here i got my plank
  there was an awful row and the
whole train crew strained themselves
getting him back on the cars and pick-
ing up his things i found his eye-
the
glasses and a piece of his watch chain
under the platform but that was after
the crack passenger had gone
   next train or two off hops a sour-
faced chap and he wants to see that
pump too so i started her up for
the gentleman he said nothing but
handed me two fine cigars and got
back on the train and off they went
   it was lonesome some more on dusty
desert and i was doing some think-
ing for i had seen the sourface stop
and grin over that open place in the
platform
    then i was in trouble sure enough
the train that brought me some eggs
and a water melon also dumped two
letters that would cause any man to
ponder and that were especially dif-
ficult for a lonesome tank tender in
mallard
  one letter was from up near the
throne saying that i was to appear
p d q for promotion and the other
was a few slighting remarks to the
effect that i was fired bodily for
neglecting the companys property and
for wantonly destroying the same with
an ax for the purpose of creating
kindling wood and also for barking the
general managers shins
   but meanwhile all those unnecessary
orders about changing train time
tank cars and other foolishness were
countermanded soon as sourface had
ticked something into headquarters
and the road did not miss a train nor
did an engine miss a drink and as i
said it was our busy season too
   so i was promoted and fired at the
same time and both letters were signed
with the same rubber stamp signature
but were evidently written on different
typewriters so i did not know what to
do about it but the tank was full
  so i just wired  haw haw to
red whiskers and went to bed for i
knew that to-morrow mallard was
going to change her population and
that the general manager thought more
of his road than he did of his shins

a lthough it is more than two
years since we published  the
radio planet by ralph milne far-
ley we still receive letters compliment-
ing it and its two predecessors the
radio man  and  the radio beasts
 many of you have been demanding
to know when another of these stories
will appear good news for you mr
farley has just completed  the radio
flyers -and it will come to you
through the columns of argosy it
will necessarily be several months be-
fore we can publish it-but anyway
it is on the way
brothers in red
there do stories come from do
w writers just pick them out of the
air  are they all simply  made up  
are they based on actual happenings 
 different writers have different
methods but the genesis of a story is
often as interesting as the finished
product certainly any one who reads
 brothers in red by f v w
mason in this issue will feel that the
author  knows his stuff -that he was
there and that in all probability the
story is founded on more than a germ
of truth
 right hear what mr mason has
to say about it
  one evening during the latter part of ir
i had joined the intelligence officers of our
brigade in a quiet game of poker as we
paused after a particularly expensive hand
we fell to talking about one of the german
counterattacks which threatened
  one of the officers made mention of the
fact that the germans refused to believe that
we were americans i asked him what they
thought we were and he replied that the ger-
man general staff had disseminated the infor-
mation that we were english and canadians
dressed up in american uniforms he went
so far as to show us a handbill which had
been widely distributed among the german
troops at the front it showed the picture of
a wildly painted and feathered indian and
had the caption  until you see one of these
believe that there are no americans in front
of you
  this little incident gave me the original
idea of the story  brothers in red
  it is a well-known fact that the majority
of europeans looked upon us as savages-
that is the uneducated classes who rely on
the movies for their information it seemed
incredible that soldiers no matter how un-
educated or unintelligent could believe these
lies but the power of propaganda has indeed
been realized since the close of the war and
since various facts as opposed to propaganda
have been revealed	f v w mason

 another newcomer joins our
argosy family this week-thom-
as barclay thomson with  the
duchess and the fight racket in
response to our request mr thomson
stands up to introduce himself
 i was born in western kentucky-not far
from where irvin s cobb first saw the light
of day but seriously doubt if he knows a
thing about it my present home is in azusa
california twenty-five miles east of los an-
geles in the heart of the orange belt and nine
miles below the san gabriel canon dam
which when completed will be the largest dam
in the world there that squares me with
the local chamber of commerce i came
to azusa twenty-seven years ago so am fully
entitled to a native son rating since were all
native sons after the tenth year my family
consists of one wife three overactive vora-
cious sons and two dodges with excellent
gasoline appetites
  i have never been in jail which is possibly
an oversight  the part of some one but have
engaged in the real estate game-as a good
orthodox californian should do for a num-
ber of years i have engaged in post office work
i am not crazy about it but like the pay very
much-what there is of it unlike zane grey
i care nothing for the ocean and cant catch a
fish on a bet however i do love the moun-
tains and like nothing better than a real deer
hunt in the high sierras with a few good
friends and i like to walk in-up rather-
behind a string of pack burros that is life

	argosy-allstory weekly
  i should like to tell you that i am simply
wild about writing but the honest truth is j
found a few years ago after intensive intro-
spection that i wasnt fit for a single other
thing  earth so turned to writing after
graduating from high school  planned to at-
tend stanford university-with the idea of
making a civil engineer out of myself i got
married instead and civil engineering and i
are both ahead of the game but its hard on
stanford married a school-teacher one who
has specialized in english and the languages
and who has plenty of will power expressed
a preference for the writing game-and let
nature take its course

and now-
as usual fred maclsaac rang the
bell neatly with world brig-
ands of the many letters praising
it now on hand there is room for this
one anvwav
new york n y
  it was about six years ago that i started
reading the argosy being attracted by the first
installment of  tarzan and the golden lion
by edgar rice burroughs
   since then  have been a fairly regular read-
er of the magazine occasionally i would lose
interest in the stories and drop the magazine
for a time but j would always return to it
when  noticed the start of some new serial
which appealed to me among the stories
which have brought me back whenever i
strayed from the fold of argosy readers were
tarzan and the ant-men  the moon
maiden and the moon men by bur-
roughs  the venus tales of ralph milne far-
ley the ship of ishtar  and seven foot-
prints to satan by a merritt the man
who mastered time by ray cummings and
george wortss unforgetable story the re-
turn of george washington
  from this list it may be correctly deduced
that my favorite form of fiction is the fan-
tastic and i hope to see more of this type in
the magazine
  at present i am reading  world brigands
by fred maclsaac and i believe it is his best
story since  the vanishing professor nor
am i forgetting  the great commander 
or  the seal of satan either whatever
may be said of maclsaacs style and technique
it cannot be denied that his stories are vivid
forceful and decidedly original in plot world
brigands  is not only a deeply interesting nar-
rative but it is based in a measure on facts
even now the united states is intensely dis-
liked in some parts of europe and there is
no telling to what lengths this hatred and
envy may go who knows but that maclsaacs
story may prove prophetic

 ertainly there is no reason why
long island should not be repre-
sented in argonotes-especially when
a long islander sends in as interesting
a letter as this
                      kings park n y
whats the matter with hearing from long
island in your argonotes  am located at
kings park just forty-five miles from broad-
way where argosy the best magazine that
ever was is or ever will be is printed i have
iust finished reading  now were rich by
edgar franklin and ill say it hit me right
between the eves as a story that is interesting
amusing- and with a good moral
  i got to reading argosy in rather a peculiar
way it was a trick the publishers played on us
old railroad mans magazine readers as i
used to be a railroad man and when argosy
absorbed railroad mans magazine and all-
story weekly i followed the crowd that
was several years ago and t have missed but
few numbers since i got tired of being dis-
appointed at the news-stands occasionally so
now  subscribe for it regularly
  i will say one thing for akcosy it is get-
ting bigger and better right along not bigger
in the sense of more reading matter perhaps
but bigger in the value of the reading
  now there is just one thing j wish to air
my views on that has made me grit my teeth
more than once while reading readers view-
point and that is panning out the westerns
