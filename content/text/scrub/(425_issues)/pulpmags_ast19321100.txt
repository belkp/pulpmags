the cavern
of the
shining ones

 by hal k wells

 it was shortly after midnight
 when a persistent nightmare
 aroused don foster from
 sleep for a moment he lay
 drowsily in his blankets there on
 the sand with memory of the
 nightmare still vivid

   it had been a monstrous flying
 thing like a giant blue-bottle fly
 that he had been battling in his
 sleep memory of the things high-
 pitched droning buzz still rang in
 his ears then abruptly he realized
 that the peculiar buzzing was no

layrohs hiring of husky down-
and-outers for his expedition is
part of a plan made ages past

 yet that thread held


astounding stories

mere echo of a nightmare it was
an actual sound that still vibrated
from somewhere within the camp

  startled into full awakening fos-
ter propped himself up on one el-
bow the sound was penetrating
but not particularly loud he was
apparently the only one whom it
had awakened in the gray gloom
of the desert starlight he saw the
blanket-shrouded figures of the rest
of the men still deep in slumber

  he realized the source of the
sound now it came from inside the
black walls of layrohs tent
pitched there in its usual isolation
on a slight rise fifty yards from
the sleeping group foster grunted
disgustedly to himself more of
layrohs scientific hocus-pocus
the man seemed to go out of his
way to add new phases of mystery
to this crazy expedition of his
through the barren wastelands of
the mojave

  for a solid week now they had
been working their way back and
forth over a thirty-mile stretch of
desert while layroh labored with
his intricate instruments searching
for something known only to him-
self whatever reason layroh had
for recruiting a party of fifteen to
accompany him was still a mystery
so far the men had done practically
nothing except trail along after
layroh while he worked with his
apparatus

  it was a state of affairs that
caused the men little worry as
long as they had enough to eat
they were quite content they were
down-and-outers all of them hu-
man derelicts recruited from the
park benches and cheap flop houses
of los angeles they had only
one thing in common all of them
were large and powerful men

  don foster was the youngest of
the fifteen and the only college
man in the group a succession of
bad breaks had finally landed him
broke and hungry on a park bench

where layroh found him layrohs
offer of ten dollars a day and all
expenses had seemed a godsend
foster had promptly jumped at the
offer layrohs peculiar conditions
and rules had seemed trivial details
at the time

foster scowled as he lit a
cigarette and stared through
the gloom at the violet-lighted tent
from which the disturbing sound
still came seven days of experi-
ence with layrohs peculiarities
had begun to make them a little
irritating his sternly enforced
code of rules was simple enough
never approach layroh unless
called never touch layrohs in-
struments never approach layrohs
tent never ask questions

  layroh neither ate with the men
nor mingled with them in any way
that could possibly be avoided as
soon as they made camp each night
he set up his small black tent and
remained inside it until camp was
broken the next morning no one
knew whether the man ever slept
all night long the violet light
glowed inside the black tent the
men had wondered about the un-
usal color of that light then had
finally decided it was probably
something required by the same
eye weakness that made layroh
wear heavily smoked goggles both
day and night

  strange sounds in the night as
layroh worked with his apparatus
in the black tent were nothing un-
usual but to-night was the first
time that foster had ever heard
this peculiar whining buzz as he
listened it rose in a sudden thin
crescendo that rippled along his
spine like a file rasping over naked
nerve-ends for one shuddering sec-
ond there seemed to be an intangi-
ble living quality in that metallic
drone as though some nameless
creature sang in horrible exultance
then abruptly the sound ceased
the cavern of the shining ones



foster drew a dep breath of
relief and ground his cigarette
into the sand beside him better
try to get to sleep again before
layroh started some new disturb-
ance with his infernal apparatus

  he was just settling down into
his blankets when a movement in
the tent drew his attention back to
it layroh was apparently chang-
ing the position of the violet light
for his tall figure was suddenly
silhouetted against the tent wall in
sharp relief

  foster started in surprise as an-
other figure loomed darkly beside
that of layroh for a moment he
thought that the unprecedented had
happened and some member of the
expedition was inside those jealous-
ly guarded tent walls with layroh
then he saw that the figure must
be a mere trick of the shadows cast
by the moving light upon some
piece of luggage it looked like
the torso of a man but the head
was a shapeless blob and the arms
were nothing more than boneless
dangling flaps a moment later the
light moved on and both shadows
vanished

  foster grinned sheepishly over
the momentary start the distorted
shadow had given him and deter-
minedly rolled himself in his blan-
kets to sleep it was after sunrise
when he awoke the rest of the
camp was already up but there was
one member of the party missing

  jeff peters empty blankets were
still spread there on the sand but
no one had seen the big negro
since the camp turned in the night
before the expeditions daily trav-
els under the blazing sun of the
mojave never had appealed par-
ticularly to jeff and he had appar-
ently at last made good his repeat-
ed threats to desert

the men were just getting up
from breakfast when layroh
finished packing his tent and ap-

paratus in his sedan and started
down toward the camp as usual
he halted some five yards away
from them standing there for a
moment in stony silence

  physically the man was a giant
towering well over six feet in
height on several occasions when
the expeditions cars had stalled in
deep sand he had strikingly demon-
strated the colossal strength in his
tall body

  his aquiline features his red-
bronze complexion and his long
black hair were all suggestive of
incan or mayan ancestry no one
had ever seen any trace of feeling
or emotion upon his impassive fea-
tures foster would have given a
good deal for just one glimpse of
the eyes hidden behind the dark-
colored goggles in their depths he
might be able to find some reason
for the tingling surge of nameless
dread that layrohs close approach
always inspired

  layroh noted jeff peters absence
at once we seem to have our first
deserter he commented evenly his
voice was as richly resonant as the
tone of some fine old violin he
hesitated almost imperceptibly be-
tween words like one to whom
english was not a native tongue

  it does not matter he contin-
ued indifferently we can spare
one man easily enough to-day we
shall continue toward the east pack
the truck at once we are ready to
start

  without waiting for an answer
he turned and strode back to the
sedan a curious thought struck
foster as he stared after layrohs
retreating figure what if the oddly
distorted shadow he had seen
against the tent wall last night had
really been that of a man-had
been that of jeff peters

for only a moment did foster
mull over the idea then he
promptly dismissed it as being


astounding stories

absurd he could imagine no pos-
sible reason for jeff peters being in
layrohs tent in the middle of the
night the shadow had been only
remotely like that of a man any-
way there had been neither head
nor arms to the figure only shape-
less masses totally unlike anything
human

  they finished packing the break-
fast stuff in the supply truck and
the party started out along the trail
with layrohs sedan leading the
way for nearly two hours they
followed their usual routine work-
ing steadily eastward and stopping
at regular intervals while layroh
made his methodical tests with his
instruments

  then near the end of the second
hour something happened that ab-
ruptly sent a thrill of excitement
through the entire expedition lay-
roh had just set his apparatus up
on a small sand dune beside the
trail the mechanism looked some-
what like a portable radio with two
slender parallel rods on top and a
number of dials on the main panel

  layroh swung the rods slowly
around the horizon while he care-
fully tuned the various dials it
was when the rods pointed toward
the southeast that there suddenly
came the first response he had ever
received from somewhere within
the mechanism there came a faint
staccato ripple of clear beauty like
countless tiny hammers beating
upon a crystal gong

the sound galvanized layroh
into the nearest aproach to
emotion anyone had ever seen him
display the giant moved with the
furious speed of a madman as he
returned the apparatus to the sedan 
and swung the car out across the
sand toward the southeast after a
mile he stopped and hurriedly set
the apparatus up again this time
the crystalline signal came in with
a noticeable increase in volume

  from then on the progress of the
party became a mad dash that taxed
the endurance of everyone except
layroh himself after the first hour
they entered a terrain so rugged
that the cars had to be abandoned
and they fought their way forward
on foot layroh was forced to turn
the radiolike apparatus over to one
of the men while he himself car-
ried another mechanism that con-
sisted of a heavy silver cylinder
with four flexible nozzles emerging
from one end

  they held as rigidly as possible
to a straight line toward the south-
east scrambling over whatever ob-
stacles intervened their only stops
were at regular intervals when
layroh checked their course each
time the crystalline signal came in
with greater volume

  their objective appeared to be a
cone-shaped peak several miles
ahead that loomed up high above
the surrounding rock masses the
oddly-shaped mountain was identi-
fied by one of the men who had
once been a mojave desert rat

  lodestone peak he announced
succinctly full of iron or some-
thin a compass always goes hay-
wire within a radius of ten miles
of it

it was early afternoon when they
finally arrived at a level area at
the base of the mountain for the
last two miles layroh had not
stopped long enough to make any
tests now he set the radiolike ap-
paratus in place some ten yards
from the face of a sheer cliff that
towered high above them

  the crystalline signal came in a
rippling flood he spun the dials
the sound ceased and the pointing
rods glowed with an aura of amber
light at their tips swift and start-
ling answer came from deep within
the heart of the cliff a mighty note
of sonorous beauty like the violent
plucking of a string on some colos-
the cavern of the shining ones



sal bass viol so powerful was the
timbre of the pulsing sound that
the entire side of the mountain
seemed to vibrate in harmony with
it

  layroh snapped off the apparatus
and the sound ceased carefully
searching until he found a certain
spot on the cliff face he stepped
close to it and unlimbered the noz-
zles of the silver cylinder foster
noted that at the place selected by
layroh there was a five-foot-wide
stratum of slightly lighter-colored
rock extending from the sand to a
point high up on the cliff face

  from the metai nozzles of the
cylinder there spurted a broad beam
of dead black there was a searing
flash of blue-white flame as the
black beam struck the cliff face
there followed a brief second dur-
ing which the rock melted into
nothingness in the heart of that
area of blue radiance then the
stabbing beam bored steadily on
back into the cliff like the flame
of a blow torch melting a way
through a block of butter

  layroh adjusted the nozzles until
the black beam was a solid shaft
of opacity seven feet in height and
nearly five in width the hole in
the cliff became a tunnel from
which blue radiance surged out-
ward in a shimmering mist as the
black beam steadily bit deeper into
the rock

ollow me layroh ordered
the men but do not approach
too close

  he stepped forward and entered
the mouth of the tunnel shaken
by the spectacular thing occurring
before their eyes yet driven by
curiosity as to what might lie at
the end of that swift-forming tun-
nel the men came crowding obe-
diently after him a moment later
they were within the passage
stumbling dazedly forward through
the billowing fog of bluish radi-

ance there was an odd almost
electric tingle of exhilaration in
that radiant mist as it surged about
their bodies

  fragments of almost-forgotten
scientific lore flitted through fos-
ters brain as he groped for a clue
to the action of the strange ray
not quite complete disintegration
of matter but something very close
to it-probably the transformation
of matter into radiant energy an
ingenious harnessing of the same
forces that are forever at work in
the cosmic crucibles of the uni-
verses myriad suns

  the action of the black ray was
amazingly rapid they were forced
to hurry forward at a fast walk to
keep their distance behind layroh
the vertical stratum of lighter-
colored rock continued straight
back into the heart of the moun-
tain it apparently served as a
guide the color of the blue flame-
mist changed perceptiblj whenever
layroh allowed the black ray to
stray into the rock at either side
of it

for nearly two hundred yards
they bored their way steadily
into the mountain their path grad-
ually sloping downward the walls
and floor of the swift-forming tun-
nel were as smooth and hard as
though glazed with a film of dia-
mond

  then abruptly layroh shut the
black ray projector off as the rock
ahead of them ended and they
broke through into another larger
tunnel dimly lighted by small
globes of violet radiance set at in-
tervals in the glassy ceiling after
thirty yards of travel along this
tunnel they found their way barred
by a massive door of copper-colored
metal

  at layrohs imperious gesture
the men halted a dozen feet back
of him in the tunnel while he
brought something out of his leather


astounding stories

belt-case foster was the only one
of the group who was near enough
to see that the object was a small
tube closely resembling a pocket
flashlight

  thi only break in the surface
of the great door was a six-inch disk
over near its right-hand edge lay-
roh slid this disk aside into the
opening that was revealed he sent
a series of flashes of colored light
from the tube-two red three green
and two blue the colors were the
combination to the light-activated
mechanism of the lock at the last
of the blue flashes there was a
whirring of hidden mechanism and
the portal swung slowly and pon-
derously open

layroh beckoned to the men
to follow him as he strode
swiftly on into a vast room that
was flooded with bluish light from
scores of the radiant globes as the
men passed through the door it
reached the limit of its opening
swing and began automatically clos-
ing again behind them but they
were too completely engrossed in
the scene before them to notice it

  they were in a great cavern
whose glass-smooth floor was nearly
a hundred yards square and whose
ceiling was so high that it was lost
in the shadows above the maze of
metal girders and cables that made
a webwork some forty feet over-
head there was a feeling of almost
incredible age about the place as
though it had been sealed away
there in the heart of the mountain
for countless centuries

  on every hand there was evi-
dence that the cavern and all its
contents were the products of a
race of beings whose science was
one that was utterly strange to that
of the modern world at the end
of the room where they stood were
row after row of different machines
great engines with bodies of dull
silver metal and with stiltlike legs

and jointed arms that made them
look like giant metal insects foster
could understand few of the de-
tails of the machines but he felt
that in efficiency and versatility
they were far ahead of earths best
modern efforts

  grouped together in the center
of the cavern were many assemblies
of apparatus linked together by
small cables that descended from
main cables in the girder-criss-
crossed ceiling overhead there was
a soft hissing of sparks leaping
between terminals and a steady
glow from oddly shaped tubes
which indicated that the mechan-
isms were still functioning in si-
lent and efficient performance of
their unknown tasks

the piece of apparatus nearest
the door was an upright skele-
ton framework of slender pillars
housing in their center a cluster of
coils set around a large drum ike
diaphragm foster wondered if this
were not the signal device with
which layroh had tuned in his own
portable instrument the principal
piece of mechanism in the central
space however-a great crystal-
walled case filled with an intricate
array of rods and wires-was some-
thing at whose purpose foster could
not even guess

  layroh strode on past the central
apparatus toward the back wall
the men followed him then as
they rounded the apparatus and
saw for the first time the incredible
things lining that rear wall tier
upon tier they stopped short in
utter stupefaction before them was
life but life so hideously and
abysmally alien that their brains
reeled in horror

  great shining slugs slumbered
there by the hundreds in their box-
like crystal cells their gelatinous
bodies glowing with pale and ever-
changing opalescence the things
were roughly pear-shaped with the
the cavern of the shining ones



large end upward deep within this
globular portion glowed a large
nucleus spot of red from the tap-
ering lower part of each slugs body
there sprouted scores of long slen-
der tendrils like the gelatinous
fringe of a jelly-fish

  the things measured nearly four
feet in height each was suspended
upright in an individual glass-
walled cell its body supported by
a loop of wire that dropped from
larger cables running between each
row of cells there was steady and
exhaustless power of some kind
coursing through those cables
where they branched at the end
of each cell-row there was a small
unit of glowing tubes and silver
terminals whose tips glowed with
faint auras of leaping sparks

the slugs were dormant now
but the regular changes in the
opalescent sheen which coursed
over their bodies like the slow
breathing of a sleeping animal gave
mute evidence that life was still in
those grotesque forms waiting only
to be awakened

  fascinated by the tiers of glow-
ing things one of the men started
slowly forward with a hand out-
stretched as though to touch one of
the cells his advance aroused lay-
roh to swift action the bronze-
faced giant whirled and swung the
nozzles of the black ray projector
into line with the man

  back yaharigan back he or-
dered imperiously the shining
ones have slumbered undisturbed
for a thousand centuries they
shall not awake from their long
sleep to find the filthy fingers of a
yaharigan defiling their crystal
cells back

  panic-stricken at the threat of
the black ray the man stumbled
backward to join his fellows lay-
rohs startling statement of the in-
credible age of the shining things
in the cases erased all thought of

the expeditions code of rules from
fosters mind

  you mean that those-those
things-moved and lived in the out-
side world a hundred thousand
years ago he asked dazedly but
there is no indication of there ever
having been any such creatures
among earths early forms of life

ool there was angry dis-
dain in layrohs resonant
voice they who slumber here are a
race born far from this planet they
are the shining ones of rikor
rikor is a tiny planet circling a
wandering sun whose orbit is an
ellipse so vast that only once in a
hundred thousand years does it ap-
proach your solar system rikors
sun was nearly dead and the shin-
ing ones had to find a new home
soon or else perish then their
planet swung near the earth and
their scouts returned with the news
that earth was ideally suited for
their purpose there were barely
five hundred of the shining ones
all told and they migrated to earth
in a body

  and theyve been in this cavern
ever since sealed up like tadpoles
in fish bowls the question came
from garrigan a strapping sandy-
haired irishman whose first blind
panic at the black rays menace was
swiftly giving way to curiosity

  it was your ancestors who drove
the shining ones into their retreat
here layroh answered grimly
when the shining ones arrived
upon earth they found the planet
already in the possession of a race
of human beings whose science was
so far advanced that it compared
favorably even with the science of
rikor this race was comparatively
few in numbers and was concen-
trated upon a small island-continent
known as atlantis shining ones
and atlanteans met in a war of ti-
tans with a planet as the stake the
shining ones were vanquished in


astounding stories

that first battle they lost a fifth of
their number and barely half a
dozen of their smallest space ships
escaped destruction

t lanning a new and deci-
jl sive assault the shining ones
planted atomic mines throughout
the foundations of atlantis but the
atlanteans struck first by a matter
of hours at a set moment every
volcanic vent on the earths surface
belched forth colossal volumes of a
green gas thougi that gas was
harmless to creatures of earth it
meant slow but certain death to all
rikorians furiously the shining
ones struck their own blow setting
off the cataclysmic explosion that
sank atlantis forever beneath the
waters of the atlantic scarcely a
handful of atlanteans escaped but
rikors victory was a hollow one
earths air was so thoroughly
poisoned that it would require cen-
turies of slow ionization by sun-
light to again make it fit for
rikorian breathing the shining
ones had at most three months be-
fore the slow poison would weaken
their bodies to the danger point
why didnt they go back to
their own planet then where they
belonged broke in the truculent
voice of garrigan again

 that was impossible layroh
answered impatiently the few
space ships they had left would
carry barely a score and rikors
sun was already so far advanced in
its swing away from earth that
there would be time for only one
trip there was only one chance for
survival remaining to them they
knew of a process of suspended
animation in which their bodies
could survive almost indefinitely
without being harmed by the atlan-
tean gas they would require out-
side aid to be awakened from that
dormant state so a small group of
them must remain active and em-
bark for rikor to try to survive

there until rikor returned near
enough to the earth for them to
again cross the void

ttmie dormant ones must have
i a retreat so well hidden that
they would not be disturbed during
the thousand centuries that must
elapse before they could be awak-
ened the shining ones sped back
to their base on the north ameri-
can continent and in the three
months remaining to them they pre-
pared this cavern here in the heart
of the mountain radium bulbs sup-
plied its light for the unfailing
source of electrical energy needed
to course through the dormant
bodies and keep them alive they
tapped the magnetic field of the
planet itself the force produced
as the earth rotates in the suns
electrical field like an armature
spinning within the coils of a
dynamo

  it was foster who broke in with
the question that was in the
thoughts of the entire party just
where do you come in on all this
he asked bluntly and what was
your reason for bringing us here
there was blazing contempt in
layrohs rich voice as he turned
toward foster yaharigan of
earth he jeered your brain is
as stupid as the feeble brains of
those true yaharigans of rikor
whose physical structure your hu-
man bodies so closely resemble
have you not guessed yet that i
am no contemptible creature of
earth-that this human shell i
wear is nothing but a cleverly con-
trived disguise look yaharigans
look upon the real face of the one
who has come to restore the earth
to its rightful masters

  with a single swift movement
layroh snatched the colored gog-
gles from his face and flung them
aside there was a smothered gasp
of horror from the group they
saw now why layroh had always
the cavern of the shining ones



worn those concealing lenses there
were no eyes in that bronzed face
nothing but two empty sockets
and from deep within the skull
there glowed through those gaping
sockets a seething pool of lurid red
-the nucleus spot of a shining
one

reeling backward with the
rest of the men from the
horror of the glowing thing within
the skull foster dazedly heard
layrohs resonant voice ring exul-
tantly on my ancestors were
among the twenty shining ones
who remained active after placing
their comrades in their long sleep
those twenty survivors set up sig-
nal apparatus in the cavern so that
it could be found again no matter
how much the outside terrain might
change then they filled in the en-
trance tunnel with synthetic rock
and embarked for rikor

  there upon that dying planet
generations passed when the time
came that rikors sun again neared
earth so rigorous had life become
upon rikor that only six rikorians
remained alive in order to increase
our chances of winning through
on the perilous trip to earth each
of us traveled in a separate space
ship the precaution was well taken
we encountered a dense cloud of
meteors near alpha centauri and
i was the only survivor

  layroh gestured briefly toward
the rows of many-armed metal en-
gines there are the normal ve-
hicles for a shining ones body-
armored machines powered by sub-
atomic motors and with appendages
equipped for every task of peace
or war this synthetic human figure
which i now wear was donned only
in order that i might have no
difficulty in mingling with earth-
men while i sought the cavern it
is an exact replica of the foody of
an atlantean including artificial
vocal chords even the colored gog-

gles necessary to hide the glowing
red of my nucleus are similar to
those worn by atlantean scientists
while working with their ray ma-
chines-

layroh was abruptly inter-
rupted by a scream of ma-
niacal fury from olsen a shambling
swede who stood near the edge of
the group ever since layrohs un-
masking the swede had been star-
ing at him with eyes rigidly wide
in terror like those of a bird con-
fronting a snake the steady con-
templation of the horror of the
blazing red thing behind layrohs
empty eye-sockets had apparently
at last driven the swede completely
insane he snatched a revolver from
his belt as he leaped forward and
fired once his shot struck layroh
in the forehead

  the bullet ripped through the
surface of layrohs face then
glanced harmlessly aside as it
struck metal underneath layroh
never even staggered from the im-
pact the black ray from the pro-
jector caught olsen before he could
fire again there was a searing flash
of flame then a swiftly melting
cloud of blue-white radiance and
the swede was gone

  layroh swung the projector back
to menace the others i had for-
gotten that yaharigans of earth
have weapons that might be annoy-
ing he said evenly two more of
you have pistols-garrigan and
ransome toss them away from you
at once hesitate-and the black
ray speaks again

  sullenly the two men obeyed his
order

  good commended layroh in
the pits where you are going you
will have little use for pistols
when i again take you from those
pits you will quickly learn why i
brought you with me yaharigans i
have called you and yaharigans you
shall be-earthly counterparts of


astounding stories

those miserable beasts of rikor who
have for ages been bred only for
the one purpose of supplying food
for the shining ones i knew that
when i found the cavern the proc-
ess of awakening the shining
ones would require that they be
carefully fed with the calcium and
lime from the bones of living
yaharigans the normal food of all
rikorians

the few yaharigans i had

  x brought from rikor were con-
sumed on my long trip to earth
so i had to recruit a party of
human beings to go with me and
serve as the necessary food for the
shining ones my search for the
cavern took longer than i had ex-
pected for i knew only its approx-
imate location my own body at
last had to have sustenance last
night the negro jeff peters pro-
vided that sustenance

  i shall feed those of you who
remain to the first group of shining
ones to be awakened after that
we shall be strong enough in num-
bers to sally forth and capture
ample food for awakening the rest
of our comrades then in our full
strength we shall emerge and again
become masters of a planet upon
which your crude race shall exist
only as yaharigan herds for our
sustenance

  layrohs resonant voice ceased
keeping the black ray projector
alertly covering the men he strode
over to a closed metal door in the
wall just beyond them he took a
small tube from a rack beside it
and opened the door by sending a
flash of yellow light into the mech-
anism of its lock

  into the pits until i am ready
for you he commanded curtly
they were first constructed for
keeping our own yaharigans while
we were working in the cavern and
they should serve just as well for
you

ith the memory of olsens
tragic fate still fresh in their
minds the men obediently filed into
the next room with layroh bring-
ing up the rear the room was little
more than a single large cell carved
from the living rock and lighted
by a single radium bulb in the ceil-
ing

  its smooth glasslike floor was
broken at intervals of ten feet by
circular pits fifteen feet deep at
layrohs order the men entered the
floor-pits one man to each pit as
foster lowered himself into one of
them he saw how grimly efficient a
trap the pit was

  an unusually tall and active man
might be able to jump high enough
to touch the edge but the effort
would be useless those glass-
smooth edges were so cunningly
rounded that they offered no pos-
sible purchase for clutching fingers
the diameter of the pit ten feet
was too great to permit any effort
at climbing by wedging ones body
between two opposing walls

  layroh sent every man into the
pits but one

  you will return to the cavern
with me carter he ordered i
have need for you at once

  they heard the door clang shut
as layroh and carter left the pit
room chaos reigned as the men
flung their bodies against the pit
walls in efforts to escape there
was the click of metal as several
of them tried with pocket knives
to chip finger-holes in the walls
but the glassy surfaces were of
diamond hardness

fosters brain was numb with
despair as he began to realize
the true meaning of those sleeping
things out in the cavern death in
some unknown and horrible form
was imminent for himself and his
companions he knew but his
thoughts were going far beyond
that to the time when the shining
the cavern of the shining ones



ones would emerge in all their re-
sistless power to ravage and con-
quer a helpless world

  there could be little doubt as to
the futility of earths best efforts
against the advanced science of
these invaders from far-off rikor
encased in their colossal machine-
bodies of glittering metal and
armed with such terrible weapons
as the black ray projector the
shining ones would be as invul-
nerable as men trampling an ant-
hill underfoot

 the future status of mankind
upon the earth would be that of
vast herds of human yaharigans
probably bred for ever greater bone
content as men breed cattle for
superior food values the picture
aroused foster to a fury of cold
desperation if they could only es-
cape from the pits there might be
a chance to trap layroh and slay
him before he brought those hordes
of opalescent slugs to life then
escape from the cavern itself would
be an easy matter even if the outer
door had been locked since they
passed through it layroh had the
light-key and foster remembered
the combination

  half a dozen wild schemes flitted
through fosters brain only to be
discarded as futile then suddenly
he thought of something that had
every chance of success if only
they were given time enough lay-
roh in his arrogance had forgotten
that his prisoners were not naked
brutes of rikor in the very cloth-
ing the men wore was the means
of escape from the pits

fosters voice cut through
the babel in the room until he
gained everyones attention

  our only chance for escape is
to get a rope between two pits he
said curtly then one man can
climb out while the other holds the
rope well have to make that rope
from our clothing no one man can

get a strip strong enough so well
have to work the strips to a central
man who can braid them into a
single heavy rope im near the
center get the strips to me tear
your clothing into ribbons and knot
them together use your knives
watches anything to weight one
end of the strip then cast until
you get contact with the pit next
to you that way all the strips can
be worked to me

  a period of feverish activity fol-
lowed while the men went to work
layroh also was busy through
several narrow ventilating slits high
in the cavern wall they heard the
hum of machinery

  the first of the men finished
knotting their ropes together with
weighted ends muffled to deaden
their fall upon the rock floor they
began casting to get contact with
their neighbors

  success came slowly there were
often scores of blind casts made
before a weighted end came into an
adjoining pit but the time finally
came when foster had a twenty-
five-foot length of rope strong
enough to bear his weight he al-
ready had a single strand making
contact with garrigan in the next
pit garrigan drew the heavier rope
in to him then acted as an anchor
while foster climbed to the floor
above

his downstretched hand pulled
garrigan to freedom getting
the other men up to the floor was
the work of but a few moments
they were a weird-looking crew in
the torn fragments of clothing that
remained to them foster stationed
them beside the locked cavern door
so that they would be hidden be-
hind it when it opened

  wait till layroh is safely in-
side he ordered then rush him
get that black ray thing out off
commission first without that we
should be more than a match for


astounding stories

him in the meantime you come
with me garrigan maybe we can
get a look into the cavern

  by climbing on garrigans broad
shoulders foster found that he had
a clear view through one of the
narrow ventilating slits layroh had
made efficient use of the time since
he had left the pit room suspended
from softly glowing wires in the
large central glass case was a cir-
cular group of-ten off the shining
ones

  fosters eyes widened in horror
as he saw the object in which the
trailing tendrils of the luminous
slugs were sunk it was the naked
body of carter as those sucking
tendrils drew out the substance of
his skeleton carters body was
changing slowly horribly sinking
into a flabby mass of puttylike flesh

  the dormant bodies of the great
slugs glowed perceptibly brighter
as they fed and the pulsations of
opalescence quickened the shin-
ing ones were beginning to awaken
faint but unmistakable there came
to fosters ears a low singing drone
from the group

  he shuddered he knew now why
jeff peters shadow had seemed so
grotesquely boneless that droning
buzzing sound he had heard from
the black tent had been the feeding
cry of a shining one-of layroh
then his horrible feast ended lay-
roh had blasted what remained of
his victim into nothingness with
the black ray

foster was abruptly startled
into action as layroh turned
from watching the central case
picking up the black ray projector
he started toward the pit-room
door foster scrambled down with
garrigan he joined the tensely
waiting group beside the door

  there was the sound of the mech-
anism unlocking the door opened
and layroh came striding in in a
concerted rush the men were upon

him fosters hurtling dive for the
black ray projector knocked the
apparatus out of layrohs hands
it crashed to the floor with a
violence that left it shattered and
useless swept off his feet by the
savage fury of the unexpected at-
tack layroh went to the floor be-
neath the writhing group of men

  the metal sinews of his magnifi-
cent body brought him to his knees
in one mighty effort but the num-
bers of his assailants were too
great again he was beaten down
while powerful hands tore at his
limbs the metal of the ingenious
machine that was layrohs body
began twisting and giving way be-
fore the savagery of the assault

  he staggered to his feet flinging
the men aside in one last mad
surge of power and lurched to-
ward the cavern his effort to slam
the door closed behind him was
blocked by the swift leap of two of
the men layroh staggered on into
the cavern then suddenly the torn
framework of his legs collapsed
completely and he fell heavily on
his back

  the men surged forward with a
shout of triumph but before they
could reach layrohs prostrate
figure one of his hands reached up
and opened his skull as one opens
the hinged halves of a box from
within the skull there rolled a great
shining slug a sinisterly beautiful
figure of glowing opalescence with
a scarlet nucleus for one breath-
taken instant it rose to its full
height of four feet hesitated as if
warily regarding the horror-struck
men then with tendrils pressed
into its body until it was nearly
spherical the slug that had been
layroh rolled like a ball of living
fire across the cavern toward the
cluster of machines foster snatched
up one of the disscarded pistols
from the floor and fired twice at
that hurtling globe of flame but
both shots missed
the cavern of the shining ones



  a moment later the slug reached
the machines it fled swiftly past a
group of smaller mechanisms and
selected a gleaming metal colossus
whose size and formidable arma-
ment indicated that it was designed
primarily as an instrument of war
with whipping tendrils the slug
swarmed up one of the metal legs
and into a small crystal-walled
compartment in the forward end of
the machine

  there was the crackling hiss of
unleashed sub-atomic forces some-
where within the metal body the
machine moved in fumbling un-
certainty for a moment as the slug
fought to get control of mechanism
that had lain idle for a thousand
centuries then swiftly full control
came and the machine came charg-
ing toward the- men

  they broke in wild panic before
the onslaught of the metal monster
as an engine of war it was in-
vincible six feet in height and
nearly twenty feet in length it
maneuvered upon its jointed legs
with bewildering speed and effi-
ciency a score of rodlike arms
projected from the main trunk
arms that were equipped for nearly
every purpose some ended in pin-
cers others in barbed points and
others in clusters of flexible metal
tentacles

  one of the men screamed in ter-
ror and broke for the door back
into the pit room foster flung him
aside and slammed the door shut
and locked

  youd be trapped like a rat in
there he grated our only chance
is to stick together and fight it
out

it was a chance that seemed in-
creasingly slight as they tried
to close in upon the machine gar-
rigan had recovered the other pistol
from the floor he emptied it into
the metal monster at a range of
less than ten feet but the bullets

glanced harmlessly off as from
armor plate

  the machine fought back with
deadly efficiency one of the dag-
ger-pointed arms impaled a man
like a speared fish pincers closed
upon the neck of another half
tearing his head from his body
with the strength of desperation
the men wrecked the pillars-and-
diaphragm apparatus and from the
debris tore metal fragments to serve
as clubs their blows against the
things pistonlike legs failed to
even shake it two more men died
before the grim efficiency of the
stabbing arms

  foster had held the remaining
bullets in his own pistol waiting
for a chance to use them against
some vulnerable spot in the ma-
chine but he saw none there was
a bare chance that if he could gain
the machines back he might find
some crevice through which he
could send a telling shot cramming
the pistol into his belt he watched
his chance then used the debris of
the wrecked apparatus as a stepping
stone for a running leap that landed
him solidly on top of the metal
bulk just back of the crystal com-
partment

  he fumbled for the pistol in his
belt but before he could even touch
it a tentacle-tipped arm lashed down
toward him picked him off the
things back and flung him with
terrific force high into the air   

for a breathless moment he saw
the girders and cables of the
ceiling hurtling toward him in-
stinctively he grabbed with both
hands at one of the lower girders
as his body thudded into it his
clutching fingers slipped momen-
tarily then held leaving him
dangling there at arms length
thirty feet above the floor

  his wits swiftly clearing from
the shock of that mighty toss
through space foster scrambled up


astounding stories

on the narrow girder sitting
astride the metal beam he looked
down at the scene below

  the battle down there was nearly
over the glowing slug in the ma-
chine was now obviously trying to
capture the remaining men alive
for further use instead of slaying
its lashing arms fought only to
stun and cripple

  six of the men still remained on
their feet but they were trapped in
an angle between heavy apparatus
and one of the walls in the central
case the ten semi-dormant slugs
still too inactive to take part in the
battle themselves seemed watching
the conflict with great unwinking
eyes of crimson

  foster groaned the metal colos-
sus was too powerful for their
feeble efforts it would take a bolt
of lightning to have any effect
upon that mighty engine of war
at the thought fosters heart
leaped in sudden inspiration there
was lightning the terrific electrical
force of a spinning planet in the
cables up here among the girders
if he could only release it

slightly below his position
and barely six feet away from
him one of the main power cables
of the cavern was suspended from
heavy insulators if the cable had
ever had an insulating sheath
around it the fabric had vanished
during the centuries for the dull
silver-colored metal was now com-
pletely bare

  if that naked cable could be
dropped into contact with layrohs
machine-body the entire power of
one of the caverns main lines
would be grounded through the
metal of the machine the position
of the cable with regard to where
the machine was now was perfect
for the scheme if foster could
sever the cable just opposite him
there was an excellent chance that
the longer one of the free ends

would drop dirctly upon the ma-
chine

  and in his possession he had a
possible means of severing that
cable-the pistol that was still
crammed in his belt there were
four shots remaining in the pistol
the cable was barely half an inch
thick but the range was so short
that he could not very well miss
if the silver-colored metal was as
soft as it looked the heavy bullets
should be enough to tear through
it

  foster thrust the pistol as close
to the cable as he could reach
then with the muzzle scarcely a
yard from the silver strand he
fired the heavy bullet caromed
from the cables surface but not
before it had torn a gash nearly a
third of the way through it

  there was a sudden cessation of
activity below as the slug in the
machine looked up at the sound of
the shot swift inspiration seized
foster and he promptly sent his
next shot down at the machine it-
self the bullet glanced harmlessly
off but his ruse worked apparently
believing that foster was merely
trying another futile attack upon
it the machine turned its attention
back to the men it had cornered
foster could be attended to later

foster slipped and nearly fell
just as he fired at the power
line the next time and his shot
missed that left him only one re-
maining cartridge aiming with in-
finite care he sent his last shot
smashing squarely into the part of
the cable remaining intact

  it trembled and sagged as the
bullet cut the remaining metal near-
ly through only a bare thread was
left yet that thread held sick at
heart over the narrow margin by
which his effort had failed foster
stared in despair at the nearly
severed cable it needed only one
solid blow to tear that last thread
the cavern of the shining ones



of metal apart but the cable was
just far enough away to be effec-
tively beyond his reach

  then suddenly fosters eyes nar-
rowed there was a way remaining
by which the weakened power line
could be broken a single hurtling
dive out and downward from the
girder would send his own body
crashing squarely into the metal
strand beneath the smashing im-
pact of his one hundred and eighty
pounds the nearly severed cable was
certain to break

  foster shuddered as he realized
what that dive into space would
mean he was not thinking of the
fall itself the thirty-foot drop to
the diamond-hard floor of the cav-
ern would in all probability mean
death or broken bones but that was
a hazard which foster was willing
to take

  it was the thought of what would
happen in the brief moment of
contact when his body met that
bare cable that drained the color
from fosters face there was the
terrific electrical energy from a
spinning world coursing through
that silver strand a force that in
all probability was powerful enough
to instantly char a human body to
a glowing cinder

if he could only insulate his body
at the point where it would
touch the cable he might have at
least a chance of surviving the
contact the only possible insul-
ating medium he had was the cloth-
ing he wore-a pair of heavy cor-
duroy trousers and the sleeveless
remnant of a woolen shirt they
could be rolled into a bundle that
would be bulky enough to at least
give him some protection from con-
tact with the bare cable

  laying the empty pistol on the
girder beside him he stripped as
quickly as his precarious perch
would permit then using the pis-
tol as a central core to give body

to the bundle he swathed it deep
within the folds of the clothing
making a thick roll that he could
hold in his right hand as he leaped

  at best the insulating qualities
of the roll would be far from per-
fect yet it might serve to minimize
the effects of the cables charge
enough to give him some chance of
escaping alive his contact with the
power line would be only for the
fractional part of a second and his
body would be completely in the
air at the time out of direct con-
tact with anything through which
the cables charge might ground

 foster crouched on the girder
his eyes fixed upon the scene be-
low as he tensely waited for the
best moment to make the leap the
machine had shifted its position
slightly while he had been strip-
ping it was now too far over the
right to be under the cable when it
fell

 for a moment as the machine
maneuvered still farther over to the
right in its conflict with the cor-
nered men foster was afraid that
his opportunity had passed an
idea came to him and he yelled
directions one of the men sud-
denly dashed to the left apparently
in a last frantic effort to escape
the metal colossus the machine
flashed quickly over to head the
fugitive off the maneuver brought
it for the moment directly under
fosters position

  fosters muscles tensed swiftly
then flung his body headlong out
into space his aim was perfect
the bulky roll of cloth in his out-
stretched right hand struck the
cable squarely with all the force of
his hurtling body behind it

  there was a searing flash of blue
flame as the last thread of the cable
snapped and a tearing flood of
agony that blotted all consciousness
from fosters brain as his falling
body hurtled on toward the cavern
floor


astounding stories

he struggled slowly back to
consciousness to find garrigan
and another of the men working
over him there was the stabbing
pain of broken bones in his left
ankle with the men helping him
he sat up and looked around

  the scene was one of utter chaos
and destruction the falling cable
had obviously found its mark on
layrohs machine-body and in its
last furious convulsions the metal
colossus had completely wrecked
the great glass case n the center
of the cavern floor

  the machine itself was now noth-
ing more than a tangled heap of
twisted metal in its shattered crys-
tal compartment was a torn blob
of swiftly blackening gelatin-all
that remained of layroh the shin-
ing one other shredded figures of
dead flesh marked where the ten
half-awakened slugs had died in the
wreckage of the glass-walled case

 and in the many tiers of small
cells along the caverns back wall
were more figures of death the
severed cable had been the source
of the energy that had kept those
dormant figures alive when that
energy ceased death had come
quickly those figures in the cells
were no longer shining ones their
bodies were already swiftly dark-
ening in decay

  foster smiled grimly as he looked
around the cavern there were
scientific treasures here that would
revolutionize a world it was a
fitting retribution for the shining
ones when they had destroyed
atlantis they had robbed earth of
countless centuries of scientific
knowledge and progress now here
in the cavern that had at last be-
come their tomb they were leaving
a legacy of science that would go
far toward repaying that ancient
debt

spying on cancer cells

opying on the mysterious life proc-
esses inside a living cell of the human
body slice by slice like an architects
cross-sections of a house but without
damaging the cell or its living contents
is the latest accomplishment of the ultra-
violet microscope of francis f lucas

  mr lucas photographs of cell interiors
have just been awarded the medal of the
royal photographic society of great bri-
tain a medal which mr lucas won once
before for his equally remarkable micro-
scopic photographs of the structure on
living materials cells from a fragment of
the tissue of a mouse cancer for example
are placed on a slip of clear quartz and
wetted with a chemical solution mr
lucas then focuses the ultraviolet rays of
his apparatus on one particular level in-
side one of these living cells as though a
gigantic microscope were focused at the
level of the top of the dining table in a
human dwelling cell walls and other
structures above and below this focus level
disappear

  the instrument photographs only what
is at that level as though the upstairs bed-
rooms and downstairs cellar of a dwelling
were transparent and vanished from the
picture leaving visible only the food and
dishes which happened to be at the pre-
cise level of the table top other cross-
sections can be photographed only a hun-
dred-thousandth of an inch or so above or
below this first one like one cross-section
of a house at the level of the table legs
another at the level of the heads of the
diners and so on

  in addition to the mouse cancer cells
mr lucas has photographed brain cells
and also in co-operation with dr mary
b stark of flower hospital the living
sperm cells of grasshoppers in the act of
reproduction no cure for cancer is fore-
seen immediately from these experiments
but the new possibility of exploring the
inside of a living cell which has run wild
and become a cancer cell may yield clues
it is hoped to the cause of this mysterious

borhood splashed in the fountain
and the usual midday assortment of
mothers tramps and out-of-works
lounged listlessly on the hot park
benches

all gated transfixed at the vast form that
towered above them




astounding stories

   as a bowl the square was filled
by the torrid sun and the trees and
grass drooped like the people on
its walks in the surrounding city
men worked in sweltering offices
and the streets rumbled with the
never-ceasing tide of business-but
washington square rested

  and then a man walked out of
one of the houses lining the square
and all this was changed

  he came with a calm steady
stride down the steps of a house on
the north side and those who
happened to see him gazed with
surprised interest for he was a
giant in size he measured at least
eleven feet in height and his body
was well-formed and in perfect
proportion he crossed the street
and stepped over the railing into
the nearest patch of grass and
there stood with arms folded and
legs a little apart the expression
on his face was preoccupied and
strangely apart nor did it change
when almost immediately from the
park bench nearest him a womans
excited voice cried

  look look oh look

  the people around her craned
their necks and stared and from
them grew a startled murmur
others from farther away came to
see who had cried out and re-
mained to gaze fascinated at the
man on the grass quickly the mur-
mur spread across the square and
from its every part men and women
and children streamed towards the
center of interest-and then when
they saw backed away slowly and
fearfully with staring eyes from
where the lone figure stood

there was about that figure
something uncanny and ter-
rible there in the hot midday
hush something was happening to
it which men would say could not
happen and men seeing it backed
away in alarm quickly they dis-
persed soon there were only white

frightened faces peering from be-
hind buildings and trees

  before their very eyes the giant
was growing

  when he had first emerged he
had been around eleven feet tall
and now within three minutes he
had risen close to sixteen feet

  his great body maintained its
perfect proportions it was that of
an elderly man clad simply in a
gray business suit the face was
kind its clear-chiselled features in-
dicating fine spiritual strength on
the white forehead beneath the
sparse gray hair were deep-sunken
lines which spoke of years of con-
centrated work

  no thought of malevolence could
come from that head with its gentle
blue eyes that showed the peace
within but fear struck ever
stronger into those who watched
him and in one place a woman
fainted for the great body con-
tinued to grow and grow ever
faster until it was twenty feet
high then swiftly twenty-five and
the feet still separated were as
long as the body of a normal boy
clothes and body grew effortlessly
the latter apparently without pain
as if the terrifying process were
wholly natural

  the cars coming into washing-
ton square had stopped as their
drivers sighted what was rising
there and by now the bordering
streets were tangled with traffic
a distant crowd of milling people
heightened the turmoil the north-
ern edge was deserted but in a
large semicircle was spread a fear-
struck panicky mob a single po-
liceman his face white and his eyes
wide tried to straighten out the
tangle of vehicles but it was in-
finitely beyond him and he sent in
a riot call and as the giant with
the kind dignified face loomed si-
lently higher than the trees in the
square and ever higher a dozen
blue-coated figures appeared and
a scientist rises



saw and knew fear too and hung
back awe-stricken at a loss whdt
to do for by now the rapidly
mounting body had risen to the
height of forty feet

an excited voice raised itself
above the general hubbub
why i know him i know him
its edgar wesley doctor edgar
wesley

  a police sergeant turned to the
man who had spoken

  and it-he knows you then go
closer to him and-and-ask him
what it means

  but the man looked fearfully at
the giant and hung back even as
they talked his gigantic body had
grown as high as the four-storied
buildings lining the square and
his feet were becoming too large
for the place where they had first
been put and now a faint smile
could be seen on the giants face
an enigmatic smile with something
ironic and bitter in it

  then shout to him from here
pressed the sergeant nervously
weve got to find out something
this is crazy-impossible my god
higher yet-and faster

  summoning his courage the other
man cupped his hands about his
mouth and shouted

  dr wesley can you speak and
tell us can we help you stop it
the ring of people looked up
breathless at the towering figure
and a wave of fear passed over
them and several hysterical shrieks
rose up as very slowly the huge
head shook from side to side but
the smile on its lips became
stronger and kinder and the bit-
terness seemed to leave it

  there was fear at that motion of
the enormous head but a roar of
panic sounded from the watchers
when with marked caution the
growing giant moved one foot from
the grass into the street behind
and the other into the nearby base

of fifth avenue just above the
arch fearing harm they were
gripped by terror and they fought
back while the trembling police-
men tried vainly to control them
but the panic soon ended when they
saw that the leviathans arms re-
mained crossed and his smile kinder
yet by now he dwarfed the houses
his body looming a hundred and
fifty feet into the sky at this mo-
ment a woman back of the semi-
circle slumped to her knees and
prayed hysterically

  someones coming out of his
house shouted one of the closest
onlookers

the door of the house from
which the giant had first ap-
peared had opened and the figure
of a middle-aged normal-sized man
emerged for a second he crouched
on the steps gaping up at the mon-
strous shape in the sky and then
he scurried down and made at a
desperate run for the nearest group
of policemen

 he gripped the sergeant and
cried frantically

thats dr wesley why dont
you do something why dont-
who are you the officer asked
with some return of an authorita-
tive manner

  i work for him im his janitor
but-cant you do anything look
at him look

  the crowd pressed closer what
do you know about this went on
the sergeant

 the man gulped and stared
around wildly hes been working
on something-many years-i dont
know what for he kept it a close
secret all i know is that an hour
ago i was in my room upstairs
when i heard some disturbance in
his laboratory on the ground floor
i came down and knocked on the
door and he answered from in-
side and said that everything was
all right-


astounding stories

  you didnt go in

  no i went back up and every-
thing was quiet for a long time
then i heard a lot of noise down
below-a smashing-as if things
were being broken but i thought
he was just destroying something
he didnt need and i didnt investi-
gate he hated to be disturbed and
then a little later i heard them
shouting out here in the square
and i looked out and saw i saw
him-just as i knew him-but a
giant look at his face why he
has the face of-of a god hes-
as if he were looking down on us
-and-pitying us   

  for a moment all were silent as
they gazed transfixed at the vast
form that towered two hundred feet
above them almost as awe-inspir-
ing as the astounding growth was
the fine dignified calmness of the
face the sergeant broke in

  the explanation of this must
be in his laboratory weve got to
have a look you lead us there

the other man nodded but just
then the giant moved again
and they waited and watched

 with the utmost caution the
titanic shape changed position
gradually one great foot over
thirty feet in length soared up
from the street and lowered farther
away and then the other distant
foot changed its position and the
leviathan came gently to rest
against the tallest building border-
ing the square and once more folded
his arms and stood quiet the enor-
mous body appeared to waver
slightly as a breath of wind washed
against it obviously it was not
gaining weight as it grew almost
now it appeared to float in the air
swiftly it grew another twenty-
five feet and the gray expanse of
its clothes shimmered strangely as
a ripple ran over its colossal bulk

  a change of feeling came gradu-
ally over the watching multitude

th face of the giant was indeed
that of a god in the noble irony-
tinged serenity of his calm features
it was as if a further world had
opened and one of divinity had
stepped down a further world of
kindness and fellow-love where
wer none of the discords that
bring conflicts and slaughterings to
the weary people of earth spiritu-
al peace radiated from the enor-
mous face under the silvery hair
peace with an undertone of sadness
as if the giant knew of the sorrows
of the swarm of dwarfs beneath
him and pitied them

  from all the roofs and the towers
of the city for miles and miles
around men saw the mammoth
shape and the kindly smile grow
more and more tenuous against the
clear blue sky the figure remained
quieily in the same position his
feet filling two empty streets and
under the spell of his smile all
fear seemed to leave the nearer
watchers and they became more
quiet and controlled

the group of policemen and
the janitor made a dash for
the house from which the giant had
come they ascended the steps
went in and found che door of the
laboratory locked they broke the
door down the sergeant looked in

 anyone in here he cried
nothing disturbed the silence and
he entered the others following

  a long wide dimly-lit room met
their eyes and in its middle the
remains of a great mass of appa-
ratus that had dominated it

 the apparatus was now com-
pletely destroyed its dozen rows
of tubes were shattered its intri-
cate coils of wire and machinery
hopelessly smashed fragments lay
scattered all over the floor no
longer was there the least shape of
meaning to anything in the room
there remained merely a litter of
glass and stone and scrap metal
a scientist rises



  conspicuous on the floor was a
large hammer the sergeant walked
over to pick it up but instead
paused and stared at what lay be-
yond it

  a body he said

  a sprawled out dead man lay on
the floor his dark face twisted up
his sightless eyes staring at the
ceiling his temple crushed as with
a hammer clutched tight in one
stiff hand was an automatic on
his chest was a sheet of paper

  the captain reached down and
grasped the paper he read what
was written on it and then he read
it to the others

 there was a fool who
 dreamed the high dream of
 the pure scientist and who
 lived only to ferret out the
 secrets of nature and harness
 them for his fellow men he
 studied and worked and thought
 and in time came to concen-
 trate on the manipulation of
 the atom especially the possi-
 bility of contracting and ex-
 panding it-a thing of greatest
 potential value for nine years
 he worked along this line
 hoping to succeed and give new
 power new happiness a new
 horizon to mankind hermeti-
 cally sealed in his laboratory
 self-exiled from human con-
 tacts he labored hard

    there came a day when the
  device into which the fool had
  poured his life stood completed
  and a success and on that very
  day an agent for a certain
  government entered his labora-
  tory to steal the device and
  in that moment the fool real-
  ized what he had done that
  from the apparatus he had in-
  vented not happiness and new
  freedom would come to his fel-
  low men but instead slaughter
  and carnage and drunken
  power increased a hundredfold

 he realized suddenly that
 mn had not yet learned to use
 fruitfully the precious power-
 ful things given to them but
 as yet could only play with
 them like greedy children-and
 kill as they played already his
 invention had brought death
 and he realized-even on this
 day of his triumph-that it and
 its secret must be destroyed
 and with them he who had
 fashioned so blindly

    for the scientist was old his
  whole life was the invention
  and with its going there would
  be nothing more

    and so he used the devices
 g-eat powers on his own body
 and then with those powers
 working on him he destroyed
 the device and all the papers
 that held its secrets

    was the fool also mad per-
 haps but i do not think so
 into his lonely laboratory with
 this marauder had come the
 wisdom that men must wait
 that the time is not yet for
 such power as he was about to
 offer a gesture his strange
 death which you who read this
 have seen yes but a useful
 one for with it he and his in-
 vention and its hurtful secrets
 go from you and a fitting one
 for he dies through his achieve-
 ment through his very life

    but in a better sense he will
  not die for the power of his
  achievement will dissolve his
  very body among you infinite-
  ly you will breathe him in
  your air and in you he will
  live incarnate until that later
  time when another will give
  you the knowledge he now de-
  stroys and he will see it used
  as he wished it used-e w

the sergeants voice ceased and
wordlessly the men in the labo-
ratory looked at each other no

comment was needed they went
out

  they watched from the steps of
edgar wesleys house at first
sight of the figure in the sky a
new awe struck them for now the
shapo of the giant towered a full
five hundred feet into the sun and
it seemed almost a mirage for defi-
nite outline was gone from it it
shimmered and wavered against the
bright blue like a mist and the blue
shone through it for it was quite
transparent and yet still they im-
agined they could discern the
slight ironic smile on the face and
the peaceful understanding light
in the serene eyes and their hearts
swelled at the knowledge of the

spirit of the courage of the fine
far-seeing mind of that outflung
titanic martyr to the happiness of
men

  the end came quickly the great
misty body rose it floated over the
city like a wraith and then it
swiftly dispersed even as steam
dissolves in the air they felt a
silence over the thousands of
watching people in the square a
hush broken at last by a deep low
murmur of awe and wonderment as
the final misty fragments of the
vast sky-held figure wavered and
melted imperceptibly-melted and
were gone from sight in the air
that was breathed by the men whom
edgar wesley loved

forts were each the apex of a far-
spread cone axis horizontal whose
body was the fanned back-ranging
of its squadron of a thousand heli-
copter planes the cones bristled
oceanward from the sea-margin of
new york their points a fifty-mile
arc of defiance their bases tangent
to one another almost touching the
ground at their lower edges then
circling upward for ten thousand
feet from van to rear each forma-
tion was five miles in length

  behind and above the main body
of the fleet sloped in echeloned
ranks hiding the threatened city
with an impenetrable terraced wall
of buzzing helios and massive forts
up back up back the serried
masses reached till the rearmost
were twenty-five thousand feet
aloft and farther behind unmov-
ing on their six-mile level were the
light copters of the reserve dane
gazed down that tremendous vista
to the far-off front line and swore
softly just his luck to be out of
the scrap the enemy would never
penetrate to these northern out-
skirts of new york

  men of the fleet general hunt-
ingtons voice sounded from his
flagship the washington somehow
its gruffness overrode the mechani-
cal quality of the intra-fleet radio
transmission almost it seemed he
was there in the tiny cabin re-
ports have at this moment been re-
ceived that our attack fleets have
been everywhere successful our
rocket ships have destroyed tokio
addis ababa odessa peiping and
cape town and are now ranging
inland through enemy territory

  even through the double leather
of his helmet a roar came to allan
he felt his craft vibrate to the ex-
ultant cheers of the fleet his own
mouth was open and his throat
rasping   

  but-the single syllable choked
the surge of sound-london paris
and berlin have fallen to the en-

emy the words thudded in the
pilots ear-phones san francisco
is being attacked communication
with new orleans has failed the
enemy are in sight of buenos
aires- the general broke off and
allan sensed dully that there was
other news news that he dared not
give the fleet

  the gruff voice changed men of
the fleet new york is in our
charge the enemy is upon us the
battle is commencing the issue is
in your hands

pat on his last word a dark
cloud spread along the south-
eastern horizon from the spear-
heads of the cone formations great
green beams shot out across the sea
orange flame flared in answer- all
along the black bank that was the
enemy fleet where the green beams
struck the orange blinked out and
the blue of sky showed through
and the american ships were as yet
untouched a great shout rose to
allans lips-that they had the
range on the enemy and the attack
defeated before it was well begun

  but was it swift as the ameri-
can rays scythed destruction along
the enemy line the gaps filled and
lethal orange leaped out again now
the black cloud was piling up was
rising till it was a towering curtain
against the sky on it came like
some monstrous tidal wave great
rents were torn through it by the
stabbing beams of the flying forts
holes where ships and men had been
whiffed into dust by the hundred
but the attack came on

  now all the great defensive cones
burst into an emerald blaze as the
smaller ships loosed their bolts
and from the terraced slope of the
supporting fleet a hundred steel
ovoids lumbered forward to meet
the threat all the vast space be-
tween the hosts mountain-high
from the seas surface was filled
with dazzling light now green now
when the sleepers woke



orange as the conflicting beams
crossed and mingled there were
gaps in the advancing curtain that
did not fill but the defending cones
were melting away were disappear-
ing were gone

  flight zlx prepare for action
danes eyes flicked over the gages
checking in routine precaution he
started when he saw the v of the
chronometers hands only six min-
utes had passed since the battles
start-it seemed hours and already
the reserve was being called on
he was suddenly cold out there
over the bay the enemy forces had
ceased their advance the ameri-
can first line cones were gone-true
enough but the support fleet was
still intact some new element had
entered the battle visible as yet
only in the washingtons powerful
television view-screens the flight
adjutants voice again snapped a
command

sand feet full speed go

 dane jerked home his throttle
the battle shot down and his seat
thrust up against him something
hurtled past blurred by the speed
of its descent the plane rocked to
a sudden detonation and allan
fought to steady it then he had
reached the commanded height at
sixty thousand feet the helio vanes
were useless only the power of the
auxiliary rocket-tubes maintained
his altitude

  formation b engage the enemy
came the order

they were just ahead a dozen
giant craft torpedo-shaped and
steel-incased the scarlet fire of
their gas blasts holding them poised
steady in their fifty-mile-long line
from curious swellings that broke
the clean lines of their under-
bodies black spheres were dropping
in steady streams allan knew then
whence came the crash that had
rocked his ship as she rose these

were bombs huge bombs charged
with heaven alone knew what
earth-shaking explosive they were
catapulting down an iron death
hail on the fleet and the city twelve
miles below

 the enemys strategy was clear
while his main fleet was engaging
the american defense in a frontal
attack these huge rocket-bombers
had looped unseen through the stra-
tosphere to this point of vantage
the planes that had leaped to this
new menace swept toward the bomb-
ers in three parallel lines above
to right and left of them allans
plane leaping to position at the
very end of one long line the
three leaders reached the first rock-
et-ship and their green beams shot
out in that instant the enemy craft
seemed to explode in intense blue
light then the awful dazzle was
gone the rocket ship was there
just as before but the american
helio-planes were gone were wiped
out as though they had never been
the next trio and the next rushed
up again and again came that flash
of force annihilating them su-
perbly the tiny gnats that were the
american planes plunged headlong
at the hovering leviathan of the
air and were whiffed into nothing-
ness sixty brave men were dancing
motes of cosmic dust before the
shocked commander could sound
the recall

 the helicopter squadron curved
away still keeping its ordered lines
but orange flame leaped out from
all twelve of the enemy vessels
orange flame that caught them that
ran along their ranks and sent them
hurtling earthward - blackened
corpses in blazing coffins aban-
don ships the adjutants last or-
der crisped coldly metallic sol-
dierly as ever in the next breath
as allan reached for the lever that
would open the trapdoor beneath
him he saw the command-ship
plunge down a flaring comet


astounding stories

above allan dane the twen-
ty-foot silk of his parachute
bellied out in the denser air of the
lower heights his respirator tube
was still in his mouth and the dou-
ble vacuum-interlined leather of his
safety suit had kept him from
freezing in the spatial cold of the
stratosphere he looked south

  all the proud thousands of the
defense fleet were gone blown to
fragments by the time bombs froip
above the city was hidden in a
thick muddy-yellow fog queer
the thought ran through his brain
that there should be fog in mid-
afternoon under a blazing sun
then he saw them the circling
black ships of the enemy trailing
behind them long wakes of the drab
yellow vapor that drifted heavily
down to shroud new york with-
gas

  allan felt nauseated as he imag-
ined a fleeting picture of the many-
leveled city of its mist-darkened
streets with swarming myriads of
slumped bodies clogging the con-
veyor belts that still moved because
no hand was left to shut them off
of women and children and aged
or crippled men strewn in tortured
horrible attitudes in all the roof-
parks in their homes in every nook
and cranny of the murdered city
he looked beneath his drifting de-
scent and saw roads that were riv-
ers alive with every manner of flee-
ing conveyance and he groaned
knowing that in moments the pur-
suing ships would send down their
lethal mist to put an end to that
futile flight

  sugar loaf mountain rose toward
him at its very summit was a clear-
ing among the trees and incon-
gruously motionless in that world
where every one was rushing from
inescapable death a man stood
calmly there gazing up at him
allan screamed down to him run
you fool run or the gas will get
you

  of course the man could not hear
that cry but one tiny arm rose and
pointed south allan followed the
direction of the gesture and saw a
black plane veering toward him
then orange flared from it though
it was distant and a wave of in-
tolerable heat enveloped him some-
thing cried within him too far-
hes too far off to kill me with his
beam then he knew no more

from new york from devas-
tated san francisco from rio
from buenos aires from fifty other
desolated points along the seaboards
of the americas the black fleets
swept along the coasts and inland
vomiting their yellow death till all
the continents were blanketed with
life-destroying gas and in europe
and australasia the destroying
hordes having smashed the proud
defenses of the coastlines engaged
in the same pursuit till in one short
week all the lands of the western
allies were swept clear of life
then the eastern ships turned
homeward to wait until the vapor
they had strewn had lost its
virulence and the teeming masses
of the east might take possession
of the half world the ebony-painted
destroyers had conquered the black
fliers turned homeward but there
was no homeland left for them to
seek

  for though the defense fleets of
the western coalition had been
everywhere beaten their attack
squadrons had been everywhere suc-
cessful all asia and africa lay
under a pall of milky emerald gas
as toxic as blasting as the
easterners yellow

  and the westerners were return-
ing too

  in their teleview screens the
commanders of the black swarms
and of the white thousands sought
their home ports and saw the world
to be a haze-covered sphere where
not even a fly could live then as
when the sleepers woke



if by common accord the white
ships and the black sped across life-
less hemispheres to meet in mid-air
over the long green swells of the
pacific they met and on the
instant they were at each others
throats like two packs of wild dogs
killing killing killing till they
themselves were killed no quarter
was asked in that fight and none
given no hope of victory was there
nor fear of defeat better swift
death in the high passion of combat
than slow hopeless drifting over a
dead world

  but there was one black ship that
slunk out of that mass suicide of
mans last remnant within its long
hulk three motionless forms lay in
a welter of blood that smeared
their officers badges and a dozen
gibbering men labored at the con-
trols of their craft the long black
shadows came at last to veil an
empty sky and a sea whereon there
was drifting wreckage but not one
sign of any life and as far to the
north a shadowed airship sped
athwart the moon searching for one
spot one tiny patch of solid ground
that was free from the dread gas
  

onsciousness came slowly
back to allan dane at first he
was aware merely that he was
alive that was astonishing enough
even if the orange beam had not
killed him with its heat the gas
should have struck his leather suit
the easterners could not be behind
his own forces in their development
of that terrible weapon

  allan felt a coolness on his face
his hands that could mean only
that his helmet and gloves had been
removed he heard movement and
opened his eyes

  at first he could see only blue-
ness pale and lambent he gazed
dully up at a lustrous glasslike
substance that arched above him
the sound of some one moving
came again and allan turned his

head to it his neck muscles seemed
stiff that simple motion drew
tremendously on his strength

 about fifteen yards away a man
bent over a transparent boxlike
contrivance in which something
fluttered from this device a metal
tube angled away into the wall
there was other apparatus on the
long table at which the man was-

  at last clear at last a mellow
rounded voice exclaimed jubilantly

 clear are you sure anthony
are you sure this other voice
throbbing with vibrant repression as
if its owner feared to believe
longed-for tidings come at last was
a womans as the man half turned
its owner came between him and
allan all he could see of them
was that the one called anthony
was very tall and thin and the
woman almost as tall and that both
wore hooded white robes the
womans falling to her heels the
mans to his knees waist-girdled
with black cords

  look for yourself helen

 she bent over the transparent
cage oh anthony how wonder-
ful 

 allan attempted to rise he was
unutterably weak to move a finger
was a gigantic task to do more
impossible he tried to call out
no sound came from his straining
throat

  the couple straightened the man
spoke too low for dane to hear
each took something from the
table something that gleamed
metallically then they turned-and
allan saw what the white robes
clothed

skulls leered at him from
beneath the hoods-fleshless
skulls tinted a pale green jutting
jawbones cavernous cheeks lipless
mouths that grinned mirthlessly-
his eyes froze to them and a scream
formed within him that he could
not utter hands appeared from


astounding stories

within the flowing sleeves and they
were skeleton hands each phalanx
clearly marked they moved that
was the worst of it the hands
moved and deep in the shadowed
eye-pits of the skulls blue light
glowed in living eyes that peered
at something to allans right

  his eyes followed the direction
of their gaze ranged along the
wall and jutting out he saw four
couches on each was a figure
shrouded and hooded in white
utterly still they were-and thd
cadaverous countenances exposed
between robe and hood betrayed
not the slightest twitch the arms
were crossed on each breast allan
realized that his own arms were
similarly crossed he looked down
at them saw the white gleam of a
robe that fell down his length in
smooth still folds saw his hands-
greenish skin stretched tight over
fleshless bones suddenly it seemed
to him that the air was musty and
fetid

  footsteps slithered across the
floor the woman-form bent over the
farthest couch with one skeleton
hand she bared an arm of the
corpselike figure the other hand
lifted-metal glinted in it and
plunged into the unshrinking limb
a slow movement of the bony
fingers and the threadlike silvery
thing was withdrawn she stared
ghoulishly-and the man too gazed
tensely at her victim a long quiver
ran through the recumbent shape
another the deaths-head on the
pallet moved slightly-and merci-
ful blackness welled up in allans
brain   

a cool liquid was in his
mouth he swallowed instinc-
tively and warmth ran through his
veins he felt strength flooding
back into him-and he remembered
horror

  thats better a mellow voice
eaid close above him drink just

a little more the cool liquid came
up against allans lips again pun-
gent and he drank once more
strength surged warmingly within
him thats a good fellow a little
more now

  fingers were on allans wrist
life-warm there was friendliness
in the voice that was speaking to
him and solicitude he dared to
look

  a skull-like head was right before
him but seen thus closely the
terror of it was lessened fleshless
indeed it was but a parchment skin
was tightly drawn over the bones
and allan could see that its true
shade was a sere yellow it was the
bluish light that had given it the
green of decay the deep-sunk eyes
were kindly they gleamed with
pleasure as allans opened and the
voice asked

  how do you feel

  allan made shift to reply though
a strange lassitude still enervated
him and his mouth was full of
tongue much better thank you
but who- who    

  with a sudden access of energy
allan sat up on his couch he
looked about him and his fears
were back full flood

  he was in a chamber with neither
door nor window-floor walls and
arched ceiling entirely formed of
the palely lustrous glasslike sub-
stance the room was perhaps
twenty by forty feet its ceiling
curving to about five yards from
the floor at its highest point and
the spectral blue glow that filled it
was apparently sourceless it lit
three vacant couches to his left to
his right were the four he had
already seen the woman was min-
istering to the occupants of these-
living skeletons that lay flaccid but
whose heads were moving barely
moving from side to side like
nothing else but a sepulcher the
place seemed a tomb in which the
dead had come to life
when the sleepers woke



allan clutched at anthonys
arm grasped textured fabric
that was cold to his frantic touch
and thin bone beneath in heavens
name he mouthed tell me what
sort of place this is before- he
stopped appalled by a sudden
thought perhaps he was insane this
seeming tomb really some hospital
ward transformed by his crazed
brain a wave of weakness overcame
him and he fell back

  careful the other spoke sooth-
ingly you must give the plasma
time to act or you may harm your-
self

  if allan shut out sight with his
eyelids and listened only to the
resonance of anthonys voice he
could hold his slipping grip on
reason he felt that the cloth of his
robe was metal fine spun and
woven that was strangely reassur-
ing

  how long do you think you have
slept

 how long dame murmured
something told him that he had
been unconscious for a long time
a week

  anthony sighed no longer than
that much longer there was re-
luctance in his tone you have lain
here for twenty years

  allans eyes flew open and he
stared up into the speakers face
twenty years somehow it did not
occur to him to disbelieve this
astounding statement he struggled
hard to realize its implication two
decades had passed since last he
remembered he had been a youth
then now he was forty-four

  anthony continued that may be
a shock to you but this will be a
greater unless i am greatly mis-
taken we seven we four men and
three women are the only living
humans left on earth

  the words dripped into allans
consciousness beyond them he
could hear movements exclama-
tions but they meant nothing to

him only the one thought tolled
knell-like within him we seven
are the only living humans left on
earth

dimly he knew that anthony
was  talking there is a
possibility a bare possibility that
somewhere near here there are two
others that chance is faint indeed
otherwise humanity is dead killed
by its own hand

  through a dizzy vertigo that
biurred sight and sound allan heard
the rounded voice go on and on
telling the story of the doom that
mans own folly had brought and
intermingled with that tale of a
world gone mad there came back
to the listener the clear-cut vision
of the day of horror that to him
seemed but yesterday he re-
membered the sudden ultimatum of
the easterners the western coali-
tions stanch defiance again he
saw a supposedly invincible fleet
utterly destroyed saw comrades
whiffed  out of existence in in-
finitesimal seconds again he
watched a city of twenty millions
inundated by a muddy yellow gas
in which no human being no ani-
mal might live he waked once
more to find himself helpless with
weakness among living corpses in
a place that seemed a tomb

  all this we saw in our long-
distance televisoscope anthony
gestured to a blank screen above the
apparatus ranged along the opposite
wall then just as that last weird
battle ended something happened
to the eye-mast outside and we
were isolated he fell silent in a
brooding reverie and allan re-
covered somewhat saw that the
other strange occupants of the place
had risen and were clustered about
that cage where something flut-
tered

  he turned to his mentor but i
still dont understand how is it
that we escaped the holocaust


astounding stories

  four of us members of the
scientific faculty of the national
university having forseen the in-
evitable result of the course of
world events had joined forces and
developed a substance-we called it
nullite-so dense and so inert that
no gas could penetrate it or chemi-
cal break it down we offered it
to the western general staff and
were laughed at for our pains then
we decided to use it to preserve
our families from the danger we
foresaw

  at first we sheathed one room
in each of our own dwellings with
the nullite later we decided that
the deposited gas might last for
many years and blasted out this
cave a hundred feet below the
summit of sugar loaf mountain
for a common refuge

  when the red word flared from
the newscast machines war we
fled here with our wives as we had
planned all that is save one coup-
le the youngest of us they never
arrived-i waited for them in the
clearing at the entrance to the
shaft at the last moment i saw you
dropping in your parachute saw
the death beam just miss you saw
you land at my feet unconscious
but still breathing i carried you
in with me there were two vacant
spaces you could occupy one of
them then we sealed the last
aperture with nullite and settled
to our vigil we did not know how
long the gas would last but we had
sufficient concentrated food and
enough air-making chemicals to last
two persons for a century

  two people allan interjected
but there were seven here

nthony nodded we had
worked out every detail of our
plan when release came we needs
must be in the full vigor of our
prime from our loins must spring
the new race that will repopulate
the earth that will found a new

civilization better we hope and
wiser than the one that has died
by injecting a certain compound
we suspended animation in all but a
single couple those so treated were
to all intents dead though their
bodies did not decay the two who
remained awake kept watch mak-
ing daily tests of the outside at-
mosphere drawn through tubes of
nullite that pierced the seal at the
end of six months they revived
another couple by the use of a
second injection and were them-
selves put to sleep we exempted
you from the watch since you could
have no companion so that while
we have lived about seven years in
the twenty you have not aged at
all

 not aged at all dane ex-
claimed why i have wasted away
to a mere bagful of bones and you
others also

  the other smiled wistfully even
though life was the merest thread
there was still an infinitely slow
using of bodily tissue but the drink
we partook of as we awoke is a
plasma that will very quickly re-
store the lost body elements in
an hour we shall all have been
rejuvenated you will be again the
age you were on that fateful day
in  and the rest of us but
seven years older look he moved
aside so that allen could see the
others who had gathered around
his couch they were a curious
semicircle of gaunt figures but he
could see that they had subtly
changed still emaciated beyond
description they were no longer
simulacra of death the contours
of their faces were rounding were
filling out and the faintest tinge
of pink was creeping into the
yellow of their skins

 anthony isnt it time that we
opened the seals and went outside
havent we been long enough in
this prison it was a short man
who spoke his voice impatient
when the sleepers woke



and there was an eager murmur
from the others

 i am as anxious as you an-
thonys slow words were dubious
but it may still be dangerous
the gas may have cleared away
only from our immediate vicinity
in hollows or places where the air
is stagnant it may still be toxic
it is my opinion that only one
should go at first to investigate

  a babble of volunteering cries
burst out but danes voice cut
through the others look here
the sentence tumbled from his lips
im an extra here it doesnt
matter whether i live or die-i
have no special knowledge i can-
not even father a family since i
have no wife i am the only one
to go out as long as there is
danger

  the young man is right some
one said he is the logical
choice

 very well agreed anthony
who appeared the leader he shall
be the first

his instructions were few one
plane had been preserved
and was in the shaft allan was
to make a circuit of the neighbor-
hood if he deemed it safe he was
to visit the building described to
him where the fourth couple had
lived and see if he could find a
trace of them then he was to
return and report his findings

  all stuffed their ears with cotton
wool and crowded against one end
of the chamber anthony had the
end of a long double wire in his
hand and it curled across the floor
to the farther wall he pressed the
button of a pear-switch-and there
was a concussion that hurled the
watchers against the wall behind
them a great gap appeared in the
farther wall beyond it a black
chasm and a helicopter that was
dimly illumined by the light from
within the room a quick inspec-

tion of the flier  revealed that its
alumino-steeloid had been un-
affected by the passage of time
and allan climbed into it a wave
of his hand simulated an insouci-
ance he did not feel then he was
rising through darkness the suns
light struck down and enveloped
him and he was in the open air
he rose above the trees

  desolation spread out beneath
him in all the vastness that un-
folded as the lone copter climbed
into a clear sky nothing moved
the air that from babyhood allan
had seen crowded with bustling
traffic was a ghastly emptiness
not even a tiny wheeling speck
betrayed the presence of a bird
and below-the gas that was fatal
to animal life seemed to have
stimulated vegetable growth-an
illimitable sea of green rolled un-
tenanted to where the first ram-
parts of new york rose against
the sky roads monorail lines all
the countless tracks of civilization
had disappeared beneath the green
tide nature had taken back its
own

  heartsick he turned south and
followed the silver stream of the
hudson the river lonely as the
sky seemed to drift oily and
sluggish down to plunge beneath
the city at the lower end of the
tappan zee allan dane came over
new york gazed down at the ruin
of its soaring towers at the leap-
ing arabesque of its street bridges
he peered into vast rifts of tum-
bled chaotic concrete and steel
nothing moved in all that spread-
ing wonder that had housed twenty
millions of people

  allan drifted lower and saw that
from what had been gardened
roof-parks now a welter of strewn
earth the green things had spread
till they covered the heaped jet-
sam with a healing blanket of
foliage not all the city had been
laid waste however here and


astounding stories

there great expanses of the clift-
like structures still stood un-
damaged and in the midst of one
of these areas he saw the high-
piled edifice to which he had been
directed its roof was lush with
vegetation but by dextrous han-
dling he set his helicopter down
upon it

  the engine roar diminished and
died silence folded around him a
black thick blanket

dane got heavily from his
seat oppressed by the vast
soundlessness and pushed through
curling plants that caught at his
heels the sound of his passage
was like crackliiyj thunder a de-
caying door was marked in faded
almost undecipherable letters
emergency stairs it was half
open and allan squeezed around
its edge spiral steps curved down
into blackness he hesitateda mo-
ment he could feel the awful
silence the emptiness below was a
pit of death anthonys words
came back to him echoed in his
ears we seven are the only liv-
ing humans left on earth

 in that moment out of the
pitch-black well of soundlessness
a scream shrilled no words only
a red thin thread of sound rising
and falling and rising again out
of depths where not even a living
mouse should be it came again
ripping the silence-a womans
scream high-pitched quivering
with fear

 allan plunged down into the
darkness caroming from wall to
wall as he half ran half fell down
the twisting stairs another sound
reverberated from unseen walls
and dane realized that it was his
own voice shouting

  his feet struck level floor a
pale rectangle of light showed be-
fore him and he dived through
it he was in a corridor dim-lit
by phosphorescent fungi that

cloaked the damp walls he halted
at fault the long hall stretched
away to either side cluttered with
grimed bones slimy with mold by
the age-blistered name cards on
closed doors he knew himself to be
on a residential level but which
way should he turn whence had
come that scream he crouched
against the wall his heartbeats
thudding loud in his ears and
listened for a clue

 a muffled sound of scuffling
came from his left allan whirled
toward it and sped down the cor-
ridor he was breathing in great
gasps and the air he breathed was
thick and musty too late to stop
he saw a slick of green slime on
the floor his foot struck it flew
out from under him he fell and
slid headlong

 something stopped him some-
thing that crunched sickeningly as
his sliding body crashed into it
two skeleton forms clasped in each
others arms moldering fabric
hanging in rags from them they
lay across the threshold of a door
and just within dane heard snarls
snufflings bestial growls the
sounds of a struggle something
thumped against the door and fell
away he heaved to his feet and
his hand found the doorknob but
suddenly he was powerless to turn
it panic tugged at him with al-
most palpable fingers drove him
to go back to his plane and safety
almost he fled-but he remembered
in time that it was a human scream
he had heard

the portal gave easily to his
lunge bluish light flooded
the chamber dazzling after the
fungous dimness a bulking form
whether ape or man he could not
make out so brutish the face so
hairy the dark body revealed by
its tattered rags bent over the
sprawled shape of a girl dane saw
her in a fleeting glimpse-the slim
when the sleepers woke



length of her the tumbled golden
hair half hiding half revealing
white curves of beauty a shoulder
from which the tunic had been
torn away then her attacker
whirled toward the intruder allan
leaped from the threshold his fist
arcing before him the blow landed
flush on the others jaw

  yellow rotted fangs showed in
a jet-black face and the huge
negro lunged for dane roaring
his rage before the american
could dodge or strike again the
others long arms were around him
allan was jerked against a barrel
chest felt his bones cracking in
a terrific hug eyes tiny and red
stared into his dane drove knees
and fists into the negro but the
awful pressure of those simian
arms across his back increased till
he could no longer breathe the
american was almost gone the
black face blurred and the con-
tinuous snarling of the brute was
dull in his ears

  suddenly dane went limp vic-
tory flashed into the red eyes the
squeezing arms relaxed and in that
moment allans legs curled around
the blacks heels jerking into the
hollows behind his captors knees
at the same instant levering from
that heel hold dane butted sharply
up against the rocky jaw all the
strength that was left in him went
into that trick and it worked the
negro crashed backward to the
floor allan twisted and rolled
free he was up looking desper-
ately around for some weapon but
it was not needed the hulk on the
floor never moved the back of the
negros head had smashed against
the floor and he was out

  dane turned and bent to the girl
she too was motionless but to his
relief her breast rose and fell
steadily he glanced about looking
for water to revive her then he
saw that this room was sheathed
with nullite then this was one of

the chambers prepared before the
plans were changed but the girl
could not be of the fourth couple
-the missing two that had never
appeared she was no more than
eighteen and whence had come
the giant black who had attacked
her

  stick up your hands quick

allan whirled to the sudden
challenge the man in the
doorway was pointing a ray-gun
steadily at him danes hands went
up and he gasped inanely who
are you

  what is going on here where
did you come from the new-
comers english was precise too
precise no hulking brute this a
yellow man slitted eyes slanted
and malevolent broad flat nose
above thin lips that were purple
against the saffron skin the uni-
form he wore showed signs of
some attempt to keep it in repair
and to its threadbare collar still
clung a tarnished insignia the
seven-pointed star emblem of the
enemy allan had fought on a
yesterday that was two decades
gone

  well have you lost the power
of speech the ray-gun jerked
forward impatiently

  an obscure impulse prompted
allans reply almost ive spoken
to no one for twenty years

  so-o-softly the orientals
eyes flicked past dane and a
sudden light glowed in them you
have been alone for twenty years
in this city we thought was empty
but you were on hand to fight with
ra-jamba for this delightful
creature something leered from
his face that sent the hot blood
surging to allans temples the
easterner stepped catlike into the
room shutting the door behind
him with his free hand

  that is true the american
said with what calmness he could


astounding stories

muster through the dizzy whirl
of his mind he clung to one
thought he must conceal the ex-
istence of the little group on
sugar loaf mountain at all costs
i had just discovered that it was
safe to leave the room similar to
this in which i had hidden from
the gas when i heard a scream i
reached here just in time to-
to interfere with ra-jambas
pleasure and save the little white
dove-for me my thanks the
yellow man bowfed mockingly
too bad he purred that you
should be robbed of the spoils of
your fight then he asked ir-
relevantly so some of you
americans found a way to cheat
our gas how many

 allan temporized there had
been several similar refuges pre-
pared he said but he did not know
whether they had been used this
was the first he had visited beside
his own but how was it that the
questioner knew so little about
what had happened here had his
people simply laid this country
waste and never revisited it

the oriental shrugged my
people are gone wiped out by
your gas as yours were wiped out
by ours he retold anthonys story
the crew of my own ship
mutinied he concluded we fled
north from that last terrible fight
north ever north till at the top
of the world we found a little
space that was riot gas-covered
there was nothing there just the
ice and the snow and the cold we
lived there twelve of us all men
there were a few bears and seals
we slew them for food-and we
grew a little mad we were men-
all men-do you understand

  as he said this last his thin
voice rose to a shriek and his eyes
darted to the girls recumbent form
at length he went on the gas be-
gan to retreat and they followed

it down they had searched town
after town city after city had
found food in plenty and all the
trappings of civilization but there
was never a living being and the
fever in their blood drove them on

 that very morning the insane
search had reached new york
they had landed on the roof of
this very building we separated
to hunt-and ra-jamba was the
lucky one but i-jung sin-am
still luckier he crept nearer to
allan and tapped him on the chest
with his weapon for look you-
while those fools used all their ray-
gun charges even the charge of
the big tube on our ship to kill
food i husbanded mine he
laughed shrilly so you see i
have the only ray-gun in the world
it shall make me master of the
earth again he laughed wildly

  now im going to kill you the
black cylinder leveled and dane
stared at death alone he would
almost have welcomed it but the
thought of the girl in the filthy
power of this beast seared through
him jung sin the little red worms
of madness crawling in his brain
paused for a final taunt

 let the thought of the white
dove in my arms cons- allans
sandaled foot shot out into the
mans stomach in the same move-
ment his hands came down one
snatched at and caught the ray-gun
the other smashed into the yellow
face jung sin lifted to the drive
of fist and foot crashed into the
wall fell to its foot from the
crumpled heap rose a shriek a
long piercing wail that ended in a
gurgle

dane froze the captured cyl-
inder in his hand and lis-
tened there were others of the un-
holy band about had thy heard
dim sound came to him he leaped
to the door flung it open faint
footfalls a distant shout came from
when the sleepers woke



far down the corridor away from
the direction of the stairs allan
glimpsed dark forms rushing to-
ward him he darted back to the
girl swung her still unconscious
to his shoulder and was out the
floor was slippery beneath his feet
he reeled as he ran and the sounds
of pursuit gained on him the
heavy burden weighed him down
the dim hallway stretched endlessly
before him from close behind
came hoarse guttural shouts that
chilled him

 the pack was not twenty feet
away when allan reached the stair
door he slammed it behind him
heard the latch click he mounted
the narrow winding steps with the
last dregs of energy draining from
him and heard a crash below that
told of the collapse of the barrier
but he had reached his plane had
flung the girl into it and was pull-
ing himself in when the first of the
pursuers burst out on the roof

  allan thrust home the throttle
the helio-vanes whined and his
copter leaped skyward he glimpsed
men running across the roof they
vanished behind a leafy arbor dane
turned the nose of his craft toward
sugar loaf amethyst in the haze
of distance but from that green
arch a black aircraft zoomed up
and shot after him the american
shook his head free of the cobwebs
of fatigue and veered westward
he must not lead the easterners to
anthonys refuge

  through the dead air over a dead
world they shot-allans white flier
and the ebony plane with the
bloody emblem of the seven-
pointed star emblazoned on its nose
allan wheeled again as the pur-
suers reached his level on a long
climbing slant

  but they continued rising they
were five hundred a thousand feet
above him then they leveled out
and dived down their strategy
flashed on him-they were plan-

ning to shepherd dane down to
force him to land where they would
have him at their mercy and their
craft was the faster

the black ship was right on
his tail allan flicked his con-
trols and his copter slid idewise
on one wing the other plane
banked in a tight arc and sped for
him dane countered with a light-
ning loop that brought him behind
his enemy his gray eyes were
steel-hard his lips were a straight
thin gash the other ship was fast-
er but his lighter and smaller was
more flexible he could not get
away but- they flipped up and
back in an inside loop allans lit-
tle craft barrel-rolled from under

  this sort of thing could not last
forever with each maneuver he
was losing altitude serrated roof-
tops were already a scant fifteen
hundred feet beneath him gaunt
gray fingers that reached up to
pluck him from the sky

  only half allans mind was con-
centrated on the aerial acrobatics
the other half plodded a weary
treadmill in the nullite chamber
beneath sugar loafs summit he
thought were three couples whose
knowledge and wisdom had pre-
served them for the repeopling of
the earth their children and their
childrens children-starting from
such a source what heights might
not the new race attain

  on the other hand the ship that
pursued him carried cowards who
had failed in mankinds supreme
test men who had lost their man-
hood ravening demi-beasts half
mad with loneliness and desire as
long as they remained alive they
would be a menace to those others
an unclean band that would for-
ever sully the new world with the
old worlds evils even should al-
lan himself escape them by some
trick of fortune they must inevita-
bly find the little band of men-


astounding stories

and women a cold chill ran
through dane as he visioned the re-
sult

  he was not afraid to die and
the girl in the cabin behind him-
better that she never awake than
that she be the sport of ra-jambas
kind a grim resolve formed itself
and he watched for a chance to put
it into execution

  it came at the end of a shift-
ing maneuver the black copter was
above and behind the white danes
fingers played swiftly over the con-
trol board his ship flipped over
backward rolling on its long axis
as it somersaulted it was directly
beneath the other then the helio-
vanes screamed and the american
plane surged straight up

a resounding crash split
the air metal ripped a fuel
tank exploded a black wing scaled
earthward zigzagging oddly danes
craft and the eastern ship clung in
an embrace of death they started
to drop but queerly the black
plane fell faster left the white one
behind as its descent gained speed
till it splashed against concrete be-
low the american helicopter was
dropping too but sluggishly some-
thing was buoying it up allan mo-
mentarily struggling out  of the
welter of blackness and pain into
which the concussion had thrown
him heard a familiar whine his
helio-vanes were still twirling
limply stutteringly bent and twist-
ed but gripping the air sufficiently
to brake his crushed planes fall

  afterwards allan figured it out
the black pilot had slipped side-
wise in that last frantic moment
his effort to escape had been fu-
tile but instead of his ships body
danes plane had struck the wing
and torn it off the impact had
irreparably damaged the american
craft but the helicopter motor and
vanes had somehow continued to
function-just enough the stanch

alumino-steeloid fuselage though
bent and disfigured had fended the
full force of the crash from allan
and his passenger

  just now however allan dane
was doing no figuring pain welled
behind his eyes his left arm was
limp and a broken stanchion
jammed his feet so they couldnt
move the vane motor stuttered
and stopped the plane floor
dropped away from beneath him
then thudded against something
the jar jolted allan into a gray
land where there was nothing   

someone was talking he
couldnt make out the words
but the sound was pleasant it
soothed the throb throb in his head
gosh that had been some party last
night celebrating flight zlxs
first prize in maneuvers great
bunch but would they be as good
in real war-sure to come soon
danes stuff had too much kick he
must have passed out early
somebody shaking him

  lea me lone wanna sleep
oh wake up please wake up
girls voice nice voice voice
like that should have pretty face
better not look though too bad
if she had buck teeth or squint
eyes

  oh what will i do youre not
dead please youre not dead
dont think so head hurts too
much allan opened his eyes
wrong again mus be dead only
angel could look like that not in
right place though mistake in
shipping directions-tags switched
or something

  a cold hand lay across his brow
and he felt it quiver dont talk
like that wake up there was
hysteria in the limpid tones

  allans brain mists cleared and
he grinned wryly i remember
now you all right

  yes but who are you are you
anthony starr
when the sleepers woke



  no but anthony sent me al-
lan struggled to rise he saw twist-
ed wreckage beside him he gasped
i seem to be a bit conked but
what-what do you know about an-
thony

  the girl fumbled in her garments
brought out a paper allan found
that he could move his right arm
without much pain he took the
yellowed sheet and read the faded
writing

   dear naomi

   you are asleep and we
 have been standing by your
 couch drinking in the dear
 sight of you you sleep sound-
 ly tired as you are by the long-
 promised story we told you on
 this your sixteenth birthday
 the tale of how the world you
 know only from our teachings
 was destroyed of how we
 planned with our friends to es-
 cape the general fate of how
 an accident separated us from
 them and immured us here
 alone of how you were born in
 this room and why you have
 lived here all your short life
 we told you all that but there
 is one thing we did not tell
 you

    our food supply has run low
  and the gas outside shows no
  signs of abatement with care-
  ful husbanding we could all
  three live for another four
  months but there is no pros-
  pect that we shall be released
  in so short a time alone you
  will have sufficient for a year
  if we had had some of carl
  thormans life-suspension serum
  -but it was his perfection of
  that which caused the change
  of plan to a common refuge
  and we never thought to stock
  with it the discarded rooms in
  our own apartments

    we have talked it over and
  have decided that you must

 have that eight months extra
 chance and so dear daughter
 this must be farewell

   when the gas is gone an-
 thony will come to seek us if
 he still lives you will know
 him by the white robe of metal
 fabric he will wear with its
 black girdle trust yourself to
 him he was our friend if all
 the food has been consumed
 and he still has not come open
 the door but fate will not be
 so cruel to you

   we are weary of the long
 waiting naomi do not grieve
 for us we shall go out into
 the gas hand in hand and re-
 lease will be welcome

 god guard you

allan was deeply moved by
the love and sacrifice so
simply worded he looked at the
girl and had to blink away a mist
that hazed his sight before he could
see her i see he said when the
year ended and anthony had not
come you opened the door-

 and the gas was gone then i
heard someone moving far down
the corridor i was so happy who
could it be but anthony i called
a hairy black giant came running
bellowing in some strange language
i was terribly frightened i think
i screamed and tried to shut the
door but he was too quick for me
he was in the room and his filthy
paws reached out for me i
screamed again dodged away from
him he pursued me i threw my-
self backward tripped and fell
my head crashed against the floor
the next thing i knew i was
here and you were twisted and
jammed there in front of me at
first i wanted to run then i saw
your robe i dragged you out then
i spied that other pile of wreckage
and i thought you too were
dead    she covered her face
with her hands


astounding stories

allan turned his head saw
for the first time the crum-
pled debris of the black ship a
hundred feet away saw stark
forms theres nothing to be afraid
of now he said its all over
well soon be with your fathers
friend with anthony

 a little smile of reassurance
trembled on the girls lips oh do
you think so

 allan nodded

 sure thing just trust to me
miss   

 call me naomi

  im allan the pilot thrust out
his big hand full fleshed now and a
little white one fluttered into it
an electric thrill rippled at the
contact and the two hands clung
the girl gave a little gasp and
pink flushed her cheeks

  naomi shivered a little and al-
lan realized that a chill breeze was
sweeping across the roof-tops and
that daylight was almost gone
look here partner wed better get
started somewhere he pulled
himself to his feet pain shot
through him and his head still
throbbed id better take a look
at that he gestured to the wreck
of the eastern ship you wait
here

 when he returned his face was
pallid and there was a sick look in
his eyes the girl asked sharply
what is it whats wrong tell
me allan

  he looked at her grimly started
to say something thought better of
it then it wasnt a pleasant
sight he shrugged come on
lets see what we can find well
have to spend the night here and
start for sugar loaf mountain in
the morning

 once more allan descended a
narrow spiral staircase into dark-
ness and silence but this time
someone was at his side and a
warmness ran through him at the
thought

the topmost floor of this build-
ing was a residential level
like the one where he had found
naomi a green mold covered every-
thing and pallid fungi emitting a
pale-green phosphorescence clung
to the walls and ceiling of the long
corridor apparently the dwellers
here had rushed out at the first
alarm had died elsewhere this
is luck allan said we shall have
a comfortable place to sleep and
food is not far away

  how is that

  why the stores level is not far
below most of new yorks struc-
tures have a number of residential
levels at the top then a floor of
retail stores and below that amuse-
ment places offices and factories
but whatever food there was
must be decayed by this time
the fresh food yes but there
was a lot of canned stuff and that
is probably all right he pushed
open a door in the eery light a
well-furnished living room was re-
vealed you wait here and ill
see what i can rustle up

  but i want to go with you
allan was inflexible please do
as i say i have my reasons

  the girl turned away oh very
well she said flatly if you dont
want me with you

  thats a good scout ill be back
just as quickly as i can and by
the way lock the door from the in-
side and dont open it till you hear
my voice

  the girl looked at him wonder-
ingly but- she began

  dont ask me why do it there
was a curious note in allans voice
one that cut off naomis question
the door shut and dane heard the
bolt shoot home

  he stood in the corridor listen-
ing intently his face strained
there was no sound save that of
naomis movements behind the
locked door allan turned to search
for the auxiliary staircase that must
when the sleepers woke



be somewhere near the bank of as-
cendor doors

  silence was again around him al-
most tangible in its heaviness his
footsteps reverberated through dead
halls the echo curiously muffled by
the coating of slime that spread
dankly green allan found the
staircase well descended cautious-
ly pausing often to listen not
even the faint scuttering of vermin
rewarded him

at last three stories down he
reached the stores level here
in a great open hall were the nu-
merous alcoved recesses of the
shops once thronged and gaudy
with the varicolored goods brought
by plane and heavy-bellied rocket-
freighter from both hemispheres
the vast space was a desert of mold-
ering dust heaps brooding there
was a faint odor in the stagnant air
-of spices and rustling silks of
rare perfumes of all the luxury of
the golden age that mans folly
had ended

 allan searched the long shelves
feverishly a nervous urge to com-
plete his task and get back to na-
omi tingling in his veins once he
stopped suddenly his body twist-
ing to the stair landing he seemed
to have heard something an indefin-
able thudding the shadow of a
sound but it did not come again
and he dismissed it as the thumping
of his own blood in his ears audi-
ble in that stillness

  at the end of a long aisle neat
rows of cans greeted him the labels
rotted off the metal rust-streaked
but apparently tight and whole he
found a metal basket a roll of wire
twisted a handle for the basket and
filled it choosing the cans by their
shape he should have liked to ex-
plore further but the urge to re-
turn tugged at him he went up the
stairs three at a time

 there was a dark oblong break
in the long glowing wall of the up-

per corridor the door-it was the
door of the apartment where he had
left naomi he leaped down the
hall shouting the portal hung
open shattered the rooms were
stark staring empty allan reeled
out again there were the marks of
footprints of many footprints in
the green scum of the hall floor
their own among them that had led
the marauders straight to the girl

  fool that he had been he had
thought she would be safer behind
a bolted door allan berated him-
self he had thought not to worry
her there had been only four
bodies in the wreckage of the black
plane-but how had the rest gotten
here so soon

 there was a humming whine
from above dane hurtled toward
the roof stairs he burst from the
upper landing fists clenched face a
furious mask a helicopter was
just rising allan jumped for it
his fingers caught and clung to the
undercarriage but the down-swing
of his body broke his hold and
dane crashed to the roof

he watched the plane saw it
zoom up turn east saw it
sink and land a half mile away
atop the building where he had
found her in the moonlight he
marked the direction of the place
its distance then he was descend-
ing stairs innumerable stairs he
could not hope to reach it in time
to save naomi but-his eyes grew
stony-he could avenge her

  afterwards that nightmare jour-
ney through the murdered city was
a detailless blur to allan he clam-
bered over heaped rubble forced
himself through windrows of piled
bones that crumbled to dust at his
touch vines and whipping creep-
ers of triumphant vegetation every-
where halted him he tore them
away with bleeding hands and stum-
bled on he fell and scrambled up
again and plodded on the intermi-


astounding stories

nable path till he had reached his
goal

  here at last some modicum of
reason penetrated into the numbed
blankness of his brain the dark
arch of the entrance-way was some-
how familiar still legible under
the verdigris of the bronze plate
on the lintel he read transporta-
tion substation-district lzx
now he understood why he had not
seen the black flier till it had
leaped in pursuit how it was that
naomis captors had so quickly
found another copter a broad
well penetrated the center of this
building-its opening must be cov-
ered by the luxuriant vines so that
he had not noted it-and dropped
down to the midsection that was a
hangar for local and private planes
his own little zenith had been
stored here on occasion there
must be other helicopters there and
a stock of fuel a dim plan began
to form at the back of his head

  but first he must find where they
were and what had happened to
naomi

  allan removed his sandals and
began the endless climb he made
no sound on the steps cushioned as
they were with mold but at each
landing he paused for a moment
listening the cold fire that burned
within him left no room for fa-
tigue for pain

  a murmuring then a laugh cut
through the deathlike stillness al-
lan was nearly to the top down
the corridor into which he crept
snakelike on his belly red light
flickered from an open door

dane moved soundlessly to
that door and lying flat
pushed his head slowly past the
sash till he could see within by
the light of a fire that danced in
the center of the unbumable mallite
floor its illumination half reveal-
ing their sodden brutish faces he
saw an unspeakably strange group

a scene from out the dawn of his-
tory it was the haunch-squatted
circle their yellow skins and black
glistening in the crimson shifting
glow he recognized the giant ne-
gro ra-jamba his head bound with
a rag and jung sin there were
five others clustered about those
two and a third a skew-eyed ori-
ental intent on some game they
were playing with little sticks that
passed from hand to hand

  before each of the players there
was a little pile of fish bones black
with much handling the negros
pile and that of jung sin were
about equal but there were only
two or three in front of the third
player and just as allan caught
sight of them the sticks clicked
and a shrill objurgation burst from
that third as the last of his mark-
ers were raked in by jung sins
taloned hand the circle hunched
closer there was a ribald taunting
laugh from ra-jamba and jung
sin glanced over his shoulder into
a shadowed corner

  have patience my lotus flower
he purred only one is left soon
the goddess of fortune and love
will clear him from my path by
the nine-headed dragon i have
never seen a game of li-fan last so
long but it draws to an end then
we shall have our joy together you
and i

  in that instant the fire flared al-
lan saw an open window in the
background and beneath it a slim
white form lying bound and help-
less fierce joy leaped in him and
fiercer hate naomi was as yet un-
touched the game was being played
for her as stake he had come in
time to save her

 but how there were eight of
the easterners in the room he had
his ray-gun and might cow them
with it and free the girl but as
soon as he had gotten her out of
the room they would surge out
after the whites he could fight
when the sleepers woke



for a while but the end was almost
inevitable and even if by some
miracle he and naomi escaped they
would be tracked to sugar loaf

  the sticks were clicking in a con-
tinuous rattle as the final bout of
the game waxed fast and furious
and as fast and furious was the
whirl of allans thoughts he
strove to remember the layout of
this building the helicopter han-
gar was next above this level out-
side the windows of this floor a
narrow ledge ran the nebulous
scheme that had entered his dazed
brain as he read the bronze plate
below took clearer form shaped it-
self to meet this new need

allan crept away to safe dis-
tance leaped to his feet and
flitted upward he was in the emp-
ty echoing space of the hangar
level the fuel tanks bulged huge
in the dimness here were reels of
the feed hose he needed-flexible
metal that had withstood the years
here a faucet nozzle and a long coil
of fine wire haste driving him he
made the connections then he was
descending again dragging behind
him a long black snake of hose
whose other end was clamped to a
vat of oxygen impregnated gaso-
line

  the rustle of the hose along the
hall floor was muffled by the greasy
slime dane got the nozzle to just
outside the door of the room where
naomi lay captive the rattle of
the playing sticks still continued
jung sins voice sounded in a lan-
guage that allan did not under-
stand but there was no mistaking
the triumphant note in the silky
jeering tones the yellow man was
winning and winning fast

  dane twisted one end of the wire
around the faucet handle then he
was unwinding the coil as he tried
the door of the chamber next to the
one where the fire burned found it
open darted across the room and

softly raised the sash the sill
here like the one beneath which
naomi lay was a bare two feet
above the ground

  he was out on the ledge sliding
along it toward the fire-reddened
oblong five feet away he crammed
his body close against the wall
kept his eyes away from the un-
fenced edge of that eighteen-inch
shelf beyond an abyss waited
twelve thousand feet of nothingness
down which a single misstep an in-
stants vertigo would send him hur-
tling suddenly the rattle of sticks
stopped and he heard the blacks
long howl of disappointed rage
the game was over

 allan reached the window
glimpsed a leering semicircle of
animal faces saw jung sin coming
toward him then he had swung in

  back jung sin back allan
was straddled over naomis form
the ray-gun thrust out before his
tense threat his face livid his eyes
blazing get back or i ray you

consternation awe flashed
into the brutal faces of the
easterners jung sin reeled back
his saffron hands rising allans
weapon swept slowly along the line
of staring men if one of you
moves i flash

  he bent to the girl keeping his
eyes on the easterners and his
weapon steady he had hung the
wire coil over his shoulder leaving
his left hand free to fumble for
and untie the cords around naomis
wrists he got them loose

  can you get your feet free na-
omi

  yes i can manage it her voice
was steady but there was a great
thankfulness vibrant in it

  then do it and get out on the
ledge quick he straightened
and the blaze of his eyes held the
yellow men and the black motion-
less

  naomi at the window behind

him gasped i know it looks
tough he encouraged her but
you can make it dont look down
go to the left and keep clear of
that wire

  im all right allan but you-
never mind about me go
ahead

  jung sin jerked forward driven
by the madness that twisted his
face into gargoyle hideousness but
allans ray-gun stabbed at him and
he halted

  im out allan

  danes foot felt back of him for
the sill found it he lifted facing
his enemies inexorably caught the
lintel with his left hand and was
crouching outside a sidewise flick
of his eyes showed naomi just
reaching the other window

  he pulled at the wire till it was
gently taut a moments compunc-
tion rose in him at what he was
about to do then the black roll of
the easterners crimes rushed into
his mind naomis safety his own
and that of the little colony that
had endured so much to preserve
humanity cried out for their ex-
tinction allan jerked the metal
thread and the faucet nozzle in the
corridor opened

  a black stream gushed forward
reached the fire and the room was
a roaring furnace allan saw the
forms of his enemies silhouetted
against the blaze for a fleeting in-
stant then they were flaming stat-
ues one only jung sin nearer
than the rest leaped for the win-
dow and escaped the first gush of
flame allan pressed the trigger of
his ray-gun but no blue flash an-
swered that pressure the weapons
charge had leaked out was gone

allan tore himself loose from
yellow hands that clutched at
him his fist crashed into jung sins
fear twisted visage and the crazed
oriental fell back into the roaring
blaze

  but allan himself was thrust
backward by that blow was sway-
ing on the very edge of the chasm
his hand went out for a saving
hold on the window sash flame
licked at it he was toppling
against the strain of his body mus-
cles to resist the inevitable fall and
death reached up from depths for
him then an arm was around him
was drawing him back to life na-
omi had darted back defying the
terror of that height the surge of
heat she had reached him just in
time-a split-second later and his
weight would have been too much
for her puny strength but in this
instant the merest touch was
enough to save him they crept
along the ledge and climbed weari-
ly in

  there was another plane in the
hangar and presently allan had it
rising through the well into clean
free air he turned to the girl in
the seat beside him and pointed at
the scene they were leaving

  look he said

  the city was in darkness beneath
them save for the one staring rect-
angle that marked a pyre but
dawn shimmered opalescent in the
east

  a soft white hand crept into al-
lans there was a long moment of
silence then allan said softly
a new day and a new world for
their children

  a sleepy tired voice sighed for
their children and ours allan

astounding stories

young mining engineer sinking his
drills in the floor of tonah basin
was not thinking of hidden people
even the gold that was clogged
upon a drill did not interest him
rawson was searching for power-
heat-energy for the whole south-
west but when a bailer was pulled
up red and dripping with blood

  then came mystery and attack by
unseen foes and rawson search-
ing for the enemy who had killed
his men and wrecked his drilling
rigs with flashes of green flame
ascended to the crater of one of
the adjacent volcanic peaks

  smithy his assistant was with
him but at a distance unable to
help he saw the sandy floor of the
choked crater change to an open
throat saw red man-things appear
with flame-throwers and rawson
as the rock on which he stood was
cut from under him by the green
blast pitched into the abyss

  mole-men smithy called them
he emptied his gun toward the re-
treating figures and fled that
night rawsons camp was de-
stroyed a settlement miles away
vanished in flames the mole-men
had found their way to the outer
world smithy pulling up the bail-
er from the shaft ten miles in the
earth found rawsons ring jammed
into the shackle rawson had not
died

  he appealed to the sheriff unsuc-
cessfully then to the governor
smithys father head of the oppos-
ing power combine got the gover-
nor to listen to the wild tale

 flying over tonah basin with
colonel culver smithy saw the
sheriffs posse wiped out a heat
ray flicked their plane and injured
culver though smithy rained small
explosive shells in retaliation upon
the enemy

  back in the governors office
smithy made his report and even
as he spoke the radio newscaster
sounded a nationwide warning at

  a number of points the enemy had
worked havoc

  only rawson held for torture by
the half-human reds knew the en-
emys power he saw the giant yel-
low workers in thousands and red
warriors malevolent as devils he
saw their system of underground
workings their fiery world within
a world

  struggling with one of the priests
in their temple of fire his pistol
saved him the priest vanished
down the white-hot throat then
trying to escape he saw a vision of
a fair-skinned girl who disappeared
as the red warriors seized him

  rawson lay close to death while
the red mole-men restored his
burned body to health among the
visions that came to him was one of
the girl other white forms that
seemed to rawson like spectres
were with her mingled with
strange words he seemed to hear
gevarro-the lake of fire   
phee-e-al has condemned him  

 again conscious his burns
healed he was taken before phee-
e-al the ruler and his priests he
saw the charred body of the sher-
iff whom he had known in the out-
side world realizing what was in
store for him rawson attacked the
ruler hoping to die quickly he
was overpowered knocked senseless
and taken toward the center of the
earth

  the lake of fire was before him
when he awoke he was helpless
the grasp of the priests could not
be shaken off blasting waves of
heat strangled him he was still
struggling when he knew that his
captors had vanished in sudden
whirling clouds of white intense
cold wrapped about him an ex-
plosion drove the clouds into
whirlwinds

he sensed other bodies close
other hands that tore him free a
narrow opening was in the wall
ahead the girl of his former
two thousand miles below



dreams was guiding him others
helped him down a steep and nar-
row way

  the white ones they had come
to him in a vision was this too a
dream

chapter xvi

the metal shell

dean rawson had passed
through a nerve-racking
experience it was not a
question of courage-raw-
son had plenty of that-but there
are times when a mans nervous
system is shocked almost to insen-
sibility by sheer horror not at
once did he realize what was hap-
pening

  perhaps it was the sound of pur-
suit that jarred him out of the fog
clouding all his thoughts and per-
ceptions it was like the sound of
fighting animals-cat-beasts-whose
snarls had risen to screaming
squalling shrieks of rage it was
sheer beastliness the din that
echoed through that narrow pas-
sage

  ahead of him the girl was run-
ning she held a light in her hand
soft wrappings of cloth hung loose-
ly from her waist like her golden
hair it was flung backward in the
strong draft of air against which
they were struggling she was out-
lined clearly before the red rock-
like masses where her light was
falling she was running swiftly
gracefully like a wild woodland
nymph

  two men their milk-white bodies
naked but for the thick folds of
their loin cloths were beside raw-
son helping him along two others
followed and by their haste and
their odd whispered words of
alarm he knew that pursuit had
not been expected they must have
thought to get away unobserved

  rawson felt his strength return-
ing he shook himself free from

 those who tried to aid him he
was amazed at how easily he ran
his weight was a mere nothing his
efforts were expended in driving
his body against the blast of wind
the air seemed dense thick he
had almost the feeling of forcing
himself through water

 ahead of him the girl darted
abruptly through a narrow crack in
the wall rawson followed-and
then began a wild race through a
network of connecting passages a
vast labyrinth of caves more like
fractures in this strange red sub-
stance which rawson could think
of only as rock for lack of a more
accurate name until at last there
was no sound except that of their
own hurrying feet

they stopped and stood pant-
ing in one of the wider pas-
sages he heard nothing but the
endless rush of the wind for the
first time rawson became aware of
his own almost naked condition

  the mole-men had prepared him
for the sacrifice they had decked
him with a loin cloth of woven
gold it felt cold to the touch and
rawson did not doubt its being
made of fine threads of the pre-
cious metal about his neck hung
a gold chain with a heavy object
suspended he tore it off and found
again a representation of a golden
sun the copper priests had ar-
rayed him to meet their fire-god
and again rawson wondered at the
emblem they employed

  what in the name of the starlit
heavens he demanded silently of
himself could this buried race
know of the sun

  the others were watching him
in the glow of that strange light
held by the girl he saw them smil-
ing they were congratulating one
another with odd soft-syllabled
words and rawson ignorant of
their tongue was mute when his
whole soul cried out to thank them


astounding stories

  he gripped the hands of the men
they were as tall as himself their
gaze level with his own their
faces were human friendly their
eyes sparkled and smiled into his
then he turned to the girl

 she had seen the methoc of
greeting this stranger employed
she extended her hand-a white
hand slim soft cool and raw-
son choking with emotion know-
ing that here was the one who had
first seen him and who had returned
to save him a stranger bent low
above that hand held in his own so
rough and burned and pressed his
lips to the slender fingers in a
quick caress

  when he raised his head she was
looking at him oddly her eyes
were deep serious and unsmiling
he wondered if blunderingly he
had offended her he could not
know he did not know their cus-
toms

  again the slim girlish figure
turned her jeweled breast-plates
flashed as she led the others on
where always the way led upward
and the wind pressed against them
unceasingly

the white ones wore sandals
that seemed woven of glass
rawsons bare feet were bruised
and sore for those narrower clefts
had been paved only with broken
fragments of the red walls he
moved less easily now the heavy
beating air tired him the lightness
of his body made it all the more
difficult to fight the steady wind
still he followed the white figure
of the girl where her light was
flashing on endless walls of red

  in his ears a new sound was reg-
istering above the rush of the air
that now was soft and warm a new
note had risen to a hollow unre-
mitting roar he knew that for
some time he had been hearing it
faintly it grew louder one long
steady unchanging note as they

advanced it was a deafening rever-
beration that seemed shaking the
whole earth when they came at last
to an open room

  it beat upon him thunderously
as deep as the deepest tone of a
mighty organ like a thousand gi-
gantic organs welded in one it
roared and shook him through and
through with its single note

  exhausted by his wild flight sur-
rounded by this maelstrom of
sound he sank to the floor and let
his laboring lungs have their way
but his eyes were searching the big
room

the great cave was too regu-
larly formed to have had a nat-
ural origin the light that the girl
had carried gave only feeble illu-
mination in so great a space that
had so evidently been hollowed out
of the solid red matter

  the light flashed here and there
as the girl and her companions
moved away they were circling
the room rawson saw the irregu-
lar outlines of entrances to many
dark passages like the one through
which they had come the red rock-
mass seemingly had been riven and
torn and apparently in front of
each opening the white figures
fought against the rush of outgoing
air rawson felt the same current
sweeping and whirling gustily about
him

  now his companions were across
the room and between him and
them in the center of the floor he
saw the mouth of a black well a
pit some twenty or more feet
across directly above where the
red rock stuff formed a domed ceil-
ing he found a counterpart of the
pit below-another great bore or
open shaft roughly circular ap-
parently it went straight on up and
was a continuation of that lower
pit

  this room was cut out rawson
was thinking by the white people
two thousand miles below



or the molemen-lord knows who
or when or why cut out around
this big shaft  

  his thoughts trailed off even
thinking seemed impossible under
the battering of the roaring noise
that pounded about him then an-
other thought pierced through the
bedlam he had found the source
of the uproar

that upper shaft the hole that
went on up must be plugged
there was no outlet that way and
this air that drove endlessly up-
ward from the room must be com-
ing from the lower shaft it was
striking up into that upper cavity

  an organ pipe truly but whence
came the unending blast of air to
keep that gigantic instrument in
operation rawson dropped to his
knees and crept slowly across the
floor toward the pit he must test
his theory-see if that was where
the air was driving in

 just short of the brink he
stopped the girl had called-a cry
of alarm she was running swiftly
toward him circling the pit and
rawson as she tugged at him try-
ing to draw him back knew that
she had mistaken his motive she
had thought he was going to cast
himself down

  he did not need to go farther
he was close to the edge and
now even above that roaring sound
he heard the rush of the column of
air he seated himself on the stone
floor and smiled up at the girl re-
assuringly her eyes that had been
dark with fear changed swiftly to
a look so sweetly beautifully ten-
der that dean rawson found him-
self thrilled and shaken by an
emotion that set his nerves to quiv-
ering even more than did the so-
norous vibration from above

  her companions had joined her
dean saw her eyes regarding them
steadily then as if reaching some
sudden final conclusion in her own

mind she dropped swiftly to her
knees beside him raised one of his
hands in hers and pressed her soft
lips against it

 and dean even had he known
their language could not in that
moment have spoken there had
been something in the look of her
eyes and the soft touch of her lips
that of themselves went far beyond
words

  you darling he was whisper-
ing softly to himself as the girl
sprang to her feet and walked
swiftly away the others following

  an angel no less-down in this
damned place

he wondered as he watched
the flickering light far across
the room what destination they
could be bound for surely no one
so radiantly beautiful could in-
habit a world of endless dungeons
like that where the mole-men lived
but if not that then what where
would their next journey take
them and in what direction would
they go

 again rawsons thoughts were
submerged beneath his own weari-
ness this air that beat about him
had seemed cool after the terrific
heat that drove in off the lake of
fire now he realized that the air
itself was hot his one spurt of
strength and energy had been ex-
pended

 he watched the men disappear
into one of the passages but he
roused himself when they returned
they were clinging to a strange de-
vice a metal cylinder that floated
in air above their heads like a
dirigible on end it was about
eight feet in diameter and some
fourteen feet in height both upper
and lower ends were rounded a
cage of parallel bars enclosed it
from end to end like springs of
steel they extended from top to
bottom where they curved in and
were attached to the rounded ends


astounding stories

rawson sat up quickly and
stared in startled amazement
at the thing glinting like polished
aluminum in the light and his en-
gineers mind responded as much to
that smooth finish and the evident
workmanship that had entered into
the making of this thing as it did
to the object itself

  the girl placed her light on the
floor she too reached up and
gripped a bar of the protecting
cage to which the others were hold-
ing with her added weight and
strength they drew it down almost
to the floor rawson knew by their
efforts that they were dealing with
something actually buoyant a metal
balloon one of the men still put-
ting his weight on the bars reached
in and opened a door in the smooth
shell he stepped inside and a
moment later the big shell dropped
to the floor and still vertical stood
on the lower rounded end of the
protecting cage rocking gently as
the hot whirling wind hit it

  they were communicating among
themselves by signs rawson saw
them motioning speech was use-
less in that roaring pandemonium-
filled room

 she was motioning for him to
follow one of the men circled that
central pit came beside rawson and
helped him to his feet steadying
him as they crossed the room the
girl had entered the big metal shell
dean saw the glow of her torch
shining through the open doorway
and through two other windows of
crystal glass

  the big room had grown dimmer
the high ceiling was lost in murky
shadows all the room was dark
save where that light struck upon
walls and floor to make them glow
blood-red the waiting lighted shell
seemed a haven of refuge to get
inside close the door lock out some
of this unendurable battering sound
-it was all rawson asked all he
could think

  the door closed he was within
the shell standing on a smooth
metal floor the others were be-
side him dully he wondered what
wild adventure was ahead

he had expected-he hardly
knew what but there should
have been machinery of some sort
if this weird balloon thing was ac-
tually to carry them there must be
some mechanism some propelling
power and instead he saw noth-
ing but the shining walls of the
circular room and at the exact cen-
ter reaching from floor to ceiling
a six-inch metal post that thick-
ened to a boxlike form on a level
with his eyes there was a plate on
the side of that box a cover and
clamps that held it in place and on
an adjoining side two little levers
one near the top of the box the
other near the bottom

 his one all-inclusive glance
showed him bulls-eye windows in
the ceiling there were more of
them in the floor one curved bar
circling the room was mounted on
brackets against the wall they
were telling him by signs that he
was to put his hands on it and
hang on one of the men was be-
side that central post he too
gripped at a projecting hand-hold
his other hand was on the lower
lever

  rawson knew his disappointment
was unreasonable but his weary
mind was tired of mysteries some
understandable bit of machinery
would have been reassuring and
then in his next thought he asked
himself what difference did it make
if this childish balloon thing were
really capable of carrying them
somewhere what of it it could
only mean more of this hideous
inner world that grew more unbear-
ably fantastic with each new expe-
rience

  his life had been- saved true
but for what end the girls eyes
two thousand miles below



were upon him reading the expres-
sion on his face she smiled en-
couragingly then rawsons hands
tightened upon the metal bar the
man who stood by the central post
had moved one lever the merest
trifle rawson felt the floor lifting
beneath him then the shell like
a bubble of metal pitched and
tossed as the powerful air currents
caught it

his own lightness saved him
from injury he gripped the
bar and held himself free of the
wall the round top of their
strange craft grated against the
domed roof then again the ship
steadied and seemed motionless and
rawson knew they had slipped up
into the still air of that upper
shaft

  for one wild instant filled with
impossible hope rawson saw this
as a means of ascent to his own
world then reason tore those wild
hopes to shreds

 its closed up above he
thought it must be thats why
it sounded that way thats why
the air drove off through those side
passages

  the next instant held no time for
thought rawsons whole attention
was concentrated upon the bar to
which he clung for quicker than
thought the metal shell the little
cylindrical world in which he and
these others were fell swiftly be-
neath them

   his body twisted in mid-air he
knew the others were being thrown
in the same manner then what an
instant before had been the ceiling
was now a floor beneath his feet
pressing up against him and giving
him weight-and by the whistling
rush of the air that tore past their
shell he knew they had fallen with
marvelous swiftness straight down
through the throat of that lower
shaft

 and now what had been down

was up the ceiling of this strange
room was now their floor but raw-
son was not deceived accelera-
tion he said its crowding us
the shell tends to fall faster than
we do its like an elevator travel-
ing downward at a swifter rate than
a free falling body

he had glimpsed the glassy side
of that well into which he
knew they had been flung he knew
that the shrieks that filled the room
time and again were caused by the
touching of their shells guiding
and protecting bars against one
glassy wall those sounds came al-
ways from the same side and raw-
son found momentary satisfaction in
his own understanding of the phe-
nomenon

  were falling free he argued
within his own mind falling to-
ward the center of the earth and
a falling body wouldnt follow a
vertical course it would tend to
hug against one wall and by
that he knew something of their
speed the necessity for it was
apparent a moment later

  above his head the bulls-eye
pointing forward in the direction of
their flight were faintly red swift-
ly they changed to crimson raw-
son was standing beside a window
in the wall of their craft that
too grew quickly to an area of
dazzling brightness slowly the
heat struck in the air in the little
room was stifling he saw the girl
turn her head and give a sharp
order

  the man by the central post re-
sponded with another slight move-
ment of the lever beneath raw-
sons feet the floor pressed upward
in a surge of speed that bent his
knees and bore him downward un-
der his hands the rod to which he
clung was hot the shining walls
were dimly glowing they were
being hurled through the very heart
of hell   


astounding stories

and then it was past the
crimson horror beyond those
windows grew dull and then black
in the blunt nose of their craft a
tiny crevice must have opened the
one who drove that projectile in its
shrieking flight had touched an-
other control that rawson had not
before seen and with a piercing
shriek a thin jet of cold air drove
down into the hot room

  no wine could have been one-half
so potent that thin jet filled the
room with buffeting whirlwinds
that grew quickly cold

  then their speed was checked
abruptly rawson was weightless
his body hanging in air moved only
as he moved his hand upon the bar
only a few feet away was the body
of the girl floating weightless like
himself the others were shouting
loud words of satisfaction but her
face was turned toward rawson
her eyes were smiling into his
while outside the little shell that
fell in meteor flight were only
shrieking winds and the blackness
into which they plunged

chapter xvii
gor

through an ordinary experi-
ence dean rawson like any
other man would have kept uncon-
scious measurement of the passing
time an hour no matter how
crowded would still have been an
hour that his mind could measure
and grasp but now he had no least
idea of the hours or minutes that
had marked their flight each lag-
ging second was an age in passing
even the flashing thoughts that
drove swiftly through his mind
seemed slow and laborious pains-
takingly he marshaled his few facts

  they know what theyre about
thats one thing dead sure theyre
onto their job and theyve got
something here that beats anything
weve ever had he mentally nailed

that one fact down and passed on
to the next and thats the bow
end of our ship up there he
looked above him at a dented place
in the ceiling the ceiling that had
been the floor of the room when
first he stepped into it there
isnt any up or down any more
ive been flipped back and forth
every time we slowed down or ac-
celerated until i dont know where
im at but i saw that dented plate
in the floor when i got in and we
started falling in that direction
but whether were falling toward
the center of the earth still or
whether we passed the center back
there at that hot spot and now this
crazy senseless shell is flying on
and up perhaps these people know
-i dont

  then fact no  they live
somewhere inside here theyre
taking me there of course it must
mean theres a race of them-and
they dont like the mole-men they
know the way back too and if
theyll help me    perhaps the
fightings not over yet

  through more endless age-long
seconds there passed through raw-
sons mind entrancing visions an
army of men like these white ones
himself at their head they were
armed with strange weapons they
were invading the mole-mens
world   

  the girl was reaching toward
him she laid one hand upon his
then pointed overhead

rawson looked quickly above
the glowing bulls-eyes star-
tled him then he knew it was
white light he was seeing not the
red threat of glowing rock their
speed had been steadily cut down
as the air pressure lessened
theyre decompressing he
thought theyre working slowly
into the lesser pressure

 the passing air no longer
shrieked insanely above its soft
two thousand miles below



rushing sound he heard the girls
voice it was clear vibrant with
happiness her hand closed convul-
sively over his her eyes beneath
their long lashes smiled unspoken
words of welcome of comradeship
and of something more

 within their room her light
which at close range seemed only a
slender bar of metal with a bril-
liantly glowing end had been
clamped in a bracket against the
wall the illumination had seemed
brilliant now suddenly it was pale
and dim

  through the bulls-eyes above a
brighter light was shining clear
and golden like the light of the
sun on a brilliant and cloudless
day and to rawson who felt that
he had spent a lifetime in the
gloomy dungeons of that inner
world that flooding brilliance was
more than mere light it was the
promise of release the very es-
sence of hope his eyes clung to
those little round windows then
the larger glass beside him blazed
forth with the bright sunlight of an
open world that was unbearable to
one who had lived so long in dark-
ness

  he held tightly to that slim hand
that remained so confidingly within
his own

  it isnt true rawson was tell-
ing himself frantically it cant be
true it must be a delusion another
dream

  he gripped the girls hand in
what must have been a painful
clasp he told himself that she at
least was real her lovely face was
before him when at last he could
bear to open his eyes

about him were the others
the cylinder rested firmly
upon a surface of pale-rose quartz
inside the shell he saw the floor
where he had stood and with that
he added one more fact to the few
he had gotten together there was

no dent in the floor the shells po-
sition was reversed what had been
up was now down rawson knew
he was standing firmly with what
seemed his normal earth weight
upon a smooth surface of rock he
knew that he was standing head
down as compared with his position
at the beginning of their flight-
as compared too with the way he
had stood in the mole-mens world
and in his own world up above

  ive passed the center of the
world the words were ringing in
his brain and then reason shot in
a quick denial youre as heavy
as you were on earth he told him-
self youd have to go through
and on to the other side the op-
posite surface of the world be-
fore your weight would come back
like that

 what could it mean he was
demanding as his eyes came back
from the machine and swept around
over a gorgeous glittering pano-
rama of crystal mountains rose and
white fields of strange plants viv-
idly green a whole world that
rioted madly in a luxury of color
before him the girl stood smiling
every line of her quivering figure
spoke eloquently of her joy in see-
ing this world through rawsons
eyes

a man was approaching a man
like the others yet whose
oval face strangely resembled that
of the girl she led rawson to-
ward him then rawson stopping
jerked backward in uncontrollable
amazement for the tall man draw-
ing near had spoken his lips were
open moving and from them came
sounds which to rawson were ab-
solutely unbelievable

  stranger said the newcomer
in the name of the holy moun-
tain and in the mountains lan-
guage  and words i bid you
welcome

  and rawson too stunned for co-


astounding stories

herent thought could only stam-
mer in what was half a shout but
youre speaking my language
youre talking the way we talk on
earth am i crazy stark raving
crazy

  but even the sound of the mans
voice could not have prepared him
for what followed there was
amazement written on the face of
the man and the girl who stood
beside him-her eyes that had been
smiling were wide and staring in
utter fear then she and the man
and the other white figures nearby
dropped suddenly to kneel humbly
before him their faces were hid-
den from him covered by their
hands as they bent their heads low
he heard the mans voice

  he speaks with the tongue of
the mountain he comes from the
land of the sun from lah-o-tah
at the top of the world and i
gor am permitted to hear his
voice

     chapter xviii
     the dance of death

through an airplanes thick
windows of shatter-proof glass
so tough and resilient that a ma-
chine-gun bullet would only make
a temporary dent the mid-day sun
flashed brightly as the big ship
rolled along each side of the small
room high up under the curve of
the cabin roof windows were
ranged others like them were in
the floor and above the same
glass made a transparent dome from
which an observer could see on all
sides

  outside was the thunderous roar
of ten giant motors but inside the
cabin-the fire-control room of a
dreadnought of the air-that blast
of sound became more a reverbera-
tion and a trembling than actual
noise

  certainly the sound of motors and
of slashing propellers as the battle

plane roared up into the sky did
not prevent free conversation
among the three men in the room
yet there was neither laughter nor
idle talk

  at a built-in desk before a bat-
tery of instruments sat farrell the
captain of the ship farther aft in
solidly anchored chairs colonel
culver and smithy were seated oc-
casionally the captain spoke into a
transmitter cutting in by phone on
different stations about the ship

 check up on that right-wing
gun sergeant-number two of the
top wing-battery recoil mechan-
ism is reported stiff    tell
chicago lieutenant we will want
one thousand gallons in the air-
gas only-no oil needed   
gun room have the gun crews
get some sleep theyll have to
stand by later on   

  colonel culver spoke musingly
guerilla warfare the hardest kind
to meet

mithy nodded absentedly he
rose and stared from one of
the side windows that was just
level with his eyes he could see
nothing but the broad expanse of
wing a sheet of smooth gray metal
along its leading edge was a row
of shimmering disks where great
propellers whirled from the top
of the wing a two-inch rickert re-
coilless thrust forth its snout it
rose in air till the whole weapon
was visible then settled again and
buried itself inside the wing

  they were testing a gun smithy
knew that inside that wing section
were other guns and men and
smoothly running motors the
whole ship was only a giant flying
wing of which their own central
section was merely a thickening

  he looksd down through a bulls-
eye in the floor the city they had
just left was beneath them wash-
ington the nations capital the
golden dome of the capitol build-
two thousand miles below



ing was slipping swiftly astern
only then did he make a belated
reply to culvers statement

  well he said shortly theyll
have to meet it their own way we
told them all we knew and a lot
of good that did-not

 five days said culver it
seems more like five years since
the devils first came out nobody
knows where they will hit next
but theyre working north-and
theres no trouble in telling where
theyve been

  smithys voice was hot in reply
hot with the intense anger of a
young aggressive man when con-
fronted by the ponderous motion
of a big organization getting slowly
under way

 if only wed gone down under-
ground he exclaimed carried the
fight to them they live there-
there must be a whole world under-
ground we could have carried in
power lines lighting the place as
we went along we could have
fought em with gas wed have
paid for it sure we would but wed
have given them enough hell to
think of down below so they
wouldnt raise so much of it up
above

  but no we had to fight accord-
ing to the textbooks and those red
devils dont fight that way they
never learned the rules

uerilla warfare colonel
culver repeated there are
certain difficulties about fighting
enemies you cant see

  theyre clever smithy admit-
ted we taught them their lesson
down there in the desert-theyve
never been seen in daylight since
out at night-and their invisible
heat-rays setting fire to a city a
mile away then mopping up with
their green flame-throwers if any-
ones left they pick our planes
out of the sky even when theyre
flying without lights darkness

means nothing to them it was
murder to send troops in against
them troops wiped out to a man
artillery-thats no good either
when we dont know how many of
the devils there are or where they
are theres no profit in shelling
the place when the brutes have gone
back underground

  colonel culver shot a warning
glance from smithy to the seated
officer about a hundred square
miles of the finest fruit country on
earth laid waste he admitted
gravely then sought to turn smithy
from his rebellious mood

  whats underground i wonder
must be a world of caves or per-
haps these mole-men can follow up
a mere crack or a fault line and
open it out with their flame-throw-
ers to make a tunnel they can go
through

  the planes captain had caught
culvers glance speak your piece
he said pleasantly dont stop on
my account theres a lot to what
mr smith says-but you dont
know all thats going on

  he had been half turned now he
swung about in his little wivel
chair whose base was riveted sol-
idly to the floor and whose safety
belt ends dangled as he turned

  my orders are to deliver you
two gentlemen at san francisco
but theres a show scheduled for
to-night down south of there-two
hundred planes big and little
scouts cruisers battle planes
theyre going to swarm in over
when the enemy makes his first
crack theres a devil of a storm
in the mountains along the route
we would usually take im afraid
ill have to swing off south he
was grinning openly as he turned
back to his desk

  colonel culver smiled back at-
taboy he said

  but smithys forehead was still
wrinkled in scowling lines as he
walked forward to an adjoining


astounding stories

room underground he was think-
ing weve got to carry the fight
to them got to lick em so theyll
stay licked but rawson-good old
dean-were too late to help him
and the lives of all the devils left
in hell cant pay for that

smithy had been dozing the
shrill whistle of a high-pitched
siren brought him fully awake in
an instant culver too sprang
alertly to his feet both men knew
the signal was the call to quarters

  they had spread blankets on the
floor of the fire-control room cul-
ver immediately folded his into a
compact bundle and smithy fol-
lowed suit as he said thats
right we dont want any feather
beds flying around here in case of
a mix-up

  even culvers simple act of stow-
ing the blankets back in their lit-
tle compartment thrilled him with
what it portended his nerves were
suddenly aquiver with anticipation
a real fight a determined effort
no telling what these big dread-
naughts could do two hundred
big and little captain farrell had
said if they could catch the en-
emy out in the open show him up
in a blaze of enormous flares   

  captain farrell was calling them
a section of the floor had been
raised up mysteriously to form a
platform beneath the shallow dome
of the conning tower farrell was
there headphones clamped to his
ears one hand on the little switch-
board at the base of the glass dome
that kept him in touch with every
station on the ship beside him was
the fire-control officer similarly
equipped though his headphone
was connected only with the gun
crews

rrhe enemys out said cap-

  x tain farrell and not just
where they were expected-theyre
raising fourteen kinds of hell the

ships have been ordered in im

hooked up with the radio room
now theyre less than a hundred
miles ahead of course we wont
mix in on it but i thought it best
to have my men standing by

  he pressed a little lever on his
switchboard and spoke into the
mouthpiece of his head-set pilot
room our two passengers colonel
culver and mr smith are coming
forward let them see whatever
they can of the show

  he gave the two a quick smile
and a nod and waved them forward
with the binoculars in his free
hand it will be lights out after
you get there well be flying dark
except for wing and tail lights up
on top the enemys movements are
uncertain perhaps he can see us
anyway but we wont advertise our-
selves to him

 the ships bow was a blunt
rounded nose of glass cut by cross
bars of aluminum alloy that deep-
er central portion of the big flying
wing was carried ten feet forward
it was but one of many details that
smithy had looked at with interest
when he had seen the ship waiting
for them on the field

the pilot room was dark when
they entered only the glow
from the instrument panel showed
the two men who were seated be-
hind the wheel controls one of
them turned and nodded a welcome

  cant offer you gentlemen seats
he said but if youll stand right
here behind us you can see the
whole works he did not wait for
a reply but turned back toward the
black night ahead

  smithy glanced past him at the
lighted instruments and found the
altimeter twelve thousand-yes
there was nasty country hereabouts
then he too stared out into the
dark at the sky sprinkled with
stars at the vague blur of an un-
lighted world far below and off at
two thousand miles below



either side and behind them the
quivering lines of cold light where
starlight was reflected dimly from
the spinning propellers

 other wing lights winked out as
he watched and he knew that from
that moment on they were invisi-
ble from below-invisible to human
eyes at least-that they were sweep-
ing on through the darkness like
some gargantuan night bird pursu-
ing its prey

 flares ahead sir one of the
pilots had spoken into the mouth-
piece of his telephone spoken light-
ly reporting back to captain far-
rell the words whipped smithys
head about and he too saw on a
distant horizon the beginning of a
white glare

 they were fighting there-two
hundred planes roaring downward
one formation following another
in his mind he was seeing it so
plainly

 the white blaze of light dead
ahead grew broader it had not
been as far distant as he had first
thought and the scene that he had
pictured came swiftly to reality

their own ship was still at the
twelve - thousand - foot level
ahead and five thousand feet be-
low tiny lights red and white and
green lights whose swift motion
made their hundreds seem like
thousands instead were weaving in-
tricate patterns in the night the
flying lights of the fighting planes
were on for the planes owivprotec-
tion and too no further conceal-
ment was possible in the glare that
shone upward from below

 settling downward were balls of
blinding fire flares dropped by the
squadron of scout planes that had
torn through in advance they
lighted brilliantly a valley which a
few hours before had been one of
many like it-square fields dark
green with the foliage of fruit trees
straight lines of crossing roads

houses and off in the distance a
little city

  and now the valley was an in-
ferno of spouting flame that city
was a vast roaring furnace under
smoke clouds of mingled blood-red
and black the valley floor was a
place of desolation of drifting
smoke and of flashing shell-bursts
as the fleet swept in above

  the myriad lights of the planes
had drawn into a circle a great
whirlpool of lines that revolved
above a mile-wide section of that
valley

  beside smithy a wheel control
was moving he clung to the pilots
seat as their own plane banked and
nosed downward and now he
shouted aloud to culver

  the mole-men there they are
thousands of them

he was pointing between the
two pilots as their own plane
swept down he could see them
plainly now clotted masses of dark
figures surging frenziedly to and
fro for an instant he saw them-
then that part of the world where
they had been was a seething inferno
of bursting bombs and shells

  beside him colonel culver spoke
quietly caught them cold thats
handing it to them

  their own plane had leveled off
with motors throttled they were
drifting slowly past only a thou-
sand feet higher than the circling
planes just off at one side culvers
quiet tones rose to a hoarse shout
the ships my god theyre fall-
ing

  his wild cry ended in a gasp be-
side him smithy in breathless hor-
ror like culver was staring at that
whirlpool of tiny lights that had
gone suddenly from smooth circular
motion into frenzied confusion or
vanished in the yellow glare of ex-
ploding gas tanks the light of their
own white flares picked them out in
ghastly clarity as they fell


astounding stories

  straight vertical lines of yellow
were burning planes again they
made horrible zigzag darts and
flashed down into view torn and
helpless while others tens and
scores of others with crumpled
wings joined the mad dance of
death

  smithy knew that he could never
tear his eyes away from the sight
yet within him something was
clamoring for his attention they
didnt do it from below that some-
thing was shouting not down in
that hell there are more of them
somewhere then somehow he
forced his eyes to stare ahead and
outside of that circle of fearful
fascination and he knew that for
an instant he was seeing a single
stab of green flame

one single light on the dark-
ness of a little knoll that
stood close beside this place of
white flame and destruction one
light-and in the valley there had
flashed a million brighter it had
shone but an instant but to smithy
watching it was the same he had
seen when their own camp was at-
tacked and now it was smithy
who was abruptly stone cold

  one hand closed upon a pilots
shoulder with a grip of steel his
other pointed down there-
theyre hiding back of that hill
picking off our ships from the side
and then like a guiding beacon a
point of green showed once more

  the plane banked sharply while
one of the pilots spoke crisp clear-
ly enunciated words into his phone
he listened then right he
snapped power dive for bow-gun
firing level off for bombing from
five hundred feet

  off into the night they were
headed then a left bank and turn
brought the place of blazing flares
and falling planes swinging smooth-
ly into view they were flying to-
ward it

against the white glare in
the valley of death was a hill
roundly outlined then the ships
nose sank heavily down and from
each broad wing in straight for-
ward-stabbing lines was the steady
lightning of the rickert batteries
in action

  the pilots room was a place of
unbearable sound the crash of
gunfire it seemed must crush the
glass wall like an eggshell by the
sheer impact of its own thunder
in that pandemonium smithy never
knew when they flattened out he
knew only that the hill ahead twin-
kled brilliantly and that each flash-
ing light was an exploding shell
he knew when the hill passed be-
neath them

  then in the night close beside
them and just outside the pilot-
room glass was a quick glow of
red the plane lurched and stag-
gered smithy clung desperately to
the seat ahead the pilot was fight-
ing madly with the wheel the
roar of bombs from astern where
the bombers had launched their mis-
siles at the approaching hill was
unheard in a world suddenly gone
chaotic he could hear nothing he
knew only that the valley dead
ahead was whirling dizzily-that it
sank suddenly from sight

  they were crashing that red
glow-they had been hit then
something hard and firm was press-
ing against him pressing irresisti-
bly it was the last conscious im-
pression upon smithys mind

chapter xix

the voice of the mountain

in a strange new world surround-
ed by a group of kneeling fig-
ures of whom one who called him-
self gor had spoken in rawsons
own tongue dean rawson stood si-
lent it was all too overwhelming
he could not bring words together
to formulate a reply he only stood
two thousand miles below



and stared with wondering eyes at
the exquisite beauty of the world
about him a world flooded with a
golden light faintly tinged with
green then he looked above him
to see the source of that light and
found the sun

  not the sun that he had known
but a flaming ball nevertheless
straight above it hung in the cen-
ter of the heavens a gleaming disk
of pale-green gold magnificently
brilliant he saw it through lids
half closed against its glare then
his gaze swept back down the blue
vault of the heavens back to a
world of impossible beauty

  directly ahead was a land of des-
olation radiant in its barrenness for
every rock every foot of ground
was made of crystal nearby hills
were visions of loveliness where
the colors of a million rainbows
quivered and flashed veins of
metal showed the rich blues and
greens of peacock coloring others
were scarlet topaz green and all
of them took the strange sunlight
that flooded them and threw it back
in blendings radiant and delicate

  the little hills began a short dis-
tance off two low ranges running
directly away one on either side
they made brilliant walls for the
flat valley between whose fore-
ground was barren rock of rose and
white but beyond the glistening
barren stretch were green fields of
luxuriant vegetation and in the dis-
tance nestled in the green were
clustered masses that might have
been a city of men still farther
on a single mountain peak white
beyond belief reared its graceful
sweeping sides to a shining apex
against the heavens of clear blue

slowly rawson turned a
hundred yards away at his left
there was water a sea whose smooth
rollers might have been undulating
liquid emeralds that broke to in-
finite flashing gems upon the shore

he swung sharply to the right and
found the same expanse of water
perhaps the same distance away

  then he turned toward the shell
which had been behind him and
the shaft from which it had
emerged and into which the air was
driving with a ceaseless rushing
sound now looking beyond them
he found the same ocean he was
standing on a blunt point of rock
projecting into the sea the rest of
this world was one vast expanse of
water

  suddenly rawson knew that it
was unlike any ocean of earth in-
stead of finishing on a sharply-cut
horizon that sea of emerald green
reached out and still out and up
it did not fall away it curved up-
ward until it lost itself in the dis-
tance and merged with the blue of
the sky it was the same on all
sides

  he swung slowly back to face the
land that perhaps was only an
island the kneeling ones had
raised their bowed heads they
were regarding him from shining
expectant eyes only the girl kept
her face averted rawson spoke to
none of them the exclamations that
his amazement and dismay wrung
from his lips were meant for him-
self

  its concave it curves upward
im on the inside of the world and
that sun is the center but what
holds us here what keeps us from
falling he passed one hand heav-
ily across his eyes the excitement
of the moment had lifted him above
the weariness of muscle and mind
now fatigue claimed him

  sleep he said dully ive got
to sleep ive got to im all in

  gor was beside him in an instant
whatever you wish is yours he
promised

rawson was to remember lit-
tle of that journey toward the
habitations of this people gor had


astounding stories

spoken at times along the way
  the land of the central
sun    the people of the light
peaceful and happy in our little
world  

 rawson had roused himself to
ask who is at the head of it
who is the king the ruler

  and the tall man beside him had
answered humbly always since
the beginning one named gor has
led my father and those who came
before him now it is i and when
i have gone my little son will take
the name of gor

  he had glanced toward the girl
and his voice had dropped into the
soft liquid syllables of their own
tongue she had smiled back at
gor though her eyes persistently
refused to meet those of rawson

  again gor spoke in words that
rawson could understand

  i think at times he said it is
my daughter loah my little loah-
san who really rules i knowing
not who you were did not approve
of this expedition but loah in-
sisted she had seen you and- a
glance from the girl cut him short

  the words lingered in rawsons
mind when he awoke the horrible
experience of the past days were
no longer predominant even his
own world seemed of a dim and
distant past

he awoke refreshed he was in
a new world and for the mo-
ment he asked nothing except to
explore its mystery he bathed un-
der a fountain in an adjoining
room and grinned broadly as he
wrapped the folds of the long gold-
en loin cloth about him

  as well be dead as out of style
he quoted and now to find gor
and loah and see what the devil
all this is about-a talking moun-
tain and a buried race that speaks
first-rate american

 gor was waiting for him in a
room whose translucent walls ad-

mitted a subdued glow from out-
side there was food on a table
strange fruits and a clear scarlet
liquid in a crystal glass rawson
ate ravenously then followed gor

  outside were houses whose tim-
bered frames of jet black contrasted
startlingly with the quartz walls
they enclosed the street was
thronged with people who drew
back to let them pass and who
dropped to their knees in humble
worship like gor the men wore
only the loin cloth but for this
gala day that simple apparel added
a note of flashing color the long
cloths wrapped about their hips
and brought up and about the waist
where the ends hung free were
brilliant with countless variations
of crimson and blue and gold the
same rainbow hues were found in
the loose folded cloths that draped
themselves like short skirts from
the womens waists here and there
in the sea of white bodies and scin-
tillant jeweled breastplates was
one with an additional flash of
color where brilliant silken scarves
had been thrown about the shoul-
ders of the younger girls

  from all the land said gor
they have come to do you honor

hardly more than a village
this cluster of strangely beau-
tiful shelters for the people of the
light beyond rawson saw the
country pastures where animals
weird and strange were cropping
the grass so vividly green fields of
growing things little crystal
houses like fanciful glistening toys
that had miraculously grown to
greater size the dwellings were
sprinkled far into the distance
across the landscape beyond them
was the base of the mountain mag-
nificent and glorious in its crystal
purity of white and the striations
vertical and diagonal that flashed
brilliantly with black jet and pea-
cock green
two thousand miles below



 rawson knew them for mineral
intrusions and knew that the moun-
tain was only one crystalline mass
of all the quartz formation that
made of the worlds inner core a gi-
gantic geode gleaming in eternal
brilliance under the glow of the
central sun and still in it all
dean rawson had seen a lack with-
out which perfection could not be
complete

 where is loah he asked of
gor i thought-i had hoped   
something in gors face told
rawson that his companion was
troubled she refused to come
he said but the wish of one of
the great ones from the land of
the sun is a command he shouted
an order before rawson could put
in a protest a man darted away

  always happy my little loah-
san said gor his eyes held a puz-
zled look always until now and
now she weeps and will not say
why come we will walk more
slowly there were questions you
wished to ask i will answer them
as we walk

  questions exclaimed rawson
a thousand of them

and now for the first time
since at the top of a barren
peak in the dark of the desert
night his wild journey had begun
he found answers definite and pre-
cise to the puzzles he had been un-
able to solve

 their speech-their language-
how was it they could talk with
him he fired the questions out
with furious eagerness and gor re-
plied

 as to their speech-the holy
mountain itself would explain and
yes truly this was the center of
the world or the sun above them
was the central sun did not at-
tract but instead repelled all mat-
ter from it-all things but one the
sun-stone of which gor would
speak later

 rawson pounced upon that and
demanded corroboration

  all the power of earth tends to
draw every object to its center yet
were here on an inner surface
were walking actually head down
and our bodies every stone every
particle of matter ought by well-
known laws to fall into that flaming
center but we dont that proves
your point-proves a counter grav-
itation then there must be a neu-
tral zone a place where this up-
ward thrust is exactly equalled by
gravitys downward pull

  the zone of fire said gor you
passed through it did you not
see

 saw it and felt it rawsons
mind leaped immediately to the
next question

 and we must have come through
it at surely a thousand miles an
hour what drove us that shell
must have gone in from here i
can understand its falling one way
but not two we should have come
to rest in that very spot-and wed
have lasted about half a second if
we had

  oro and grah said gor oro
the sun-stone and grah the stone-
that-loves-the-dark but they are
not stones neither are they metal
we find them deep in the ground
clinging to the caves a fine pow-
der both of them

  still i dont get it said raw-
son you drive that shell in from
here and then you drive it back
again

  that too i will explain later
it is simple even the dwellers in
the dark-those whom you call the
mole-men-have oro and grah to
serve them

gor launched into a long ac-
count of their tribal legends
of that time in the long ago when
an angry sun god had driven his
children inside the earth of how
gor and the son of gor and his


astounding stories

sons sons tried always to return

  rawson was listening only sub-
consciously they were circling the
white mountain ascending its lower
slope now he could see beyond it
as far as the land extended and he
was startled to find this distance so
short they were on an island ten
miles or so in length and beyond
it was the sea he must ask gor
about that

  it is all that is left said gor
when rawson interrupted his nar-
rative once the land was great
and the sea small-this also in the
long ago-but always it has risen
the air we breathe and the water in
the sea come from the central sun
the air rushes out as you know
the water has no place to retreat
again he took up his tale but
rawsons eyes were following the
upward curve of that sea they
seemed to be in the bottom of a
great bowl he was trying to esti-
mate trying to gage distance

     and so after many gener-
ations had lived and died they
found the pathway to the light
gor was saying it is our name
for the shaft through which you
came this was thousands of your
years ago when he who was then
gor and the bravest of the tribe
descended even then they were
workers in metal and they knew of
oro and grah they were our
fathers the first people of the
light

rawson had a question ready
on his tongue but gors words
suggested another that shaft
he said the pathway to the light
-do you mean it extends clear up
to the mole-mens world why
dont they come down

  to them the way is lost the
pathway is closed above the zone
of fire that other gor did that
and those who remained-the mole-
men-have forgotten they could
break their way through if they

knew - they are master-workers
with fire-but for them the path-
way ends and below is the great
heat but we know of a way around
the closed place the hidden way to
the great lake of fire

 they could break their way
through if they knew repeated
rawson softly for an instant he
stood silent and unbreathing he
was remembering the ugly eyes in
a priests hideous face the eyes
were watching him as the white
ones took him away

  he forced his thoughts to come
back to the earlier question
what he asked is the diameter
the distance across the inside
world how far is it from here to
your sun how many miles

 miles questioned gor we
know the word for the mountain
has told us but the length of a mile
we could not know this i can
say there were wise men in the
past when our own world was
larger they worked magic with
little marks on paper it is said
that they knew that if one came
here from our sun and kept on as
far again through the solid rock
he would reach the outside-the
land of the true sun from which
our forefathers came

  rawson nodded his head while
his eyes followed that sweeping
green bowl of the sea not far
off he said abstractedly two
thousand miles radius-and the
earth itself not a solid ball but a
big globular shell two thousand
miles thick i could rig up a level
i suppose work out an approxima-
tion of the curvature

 from the smooth winding path
which they had followed there
sounded behind them hurrying foot-
steps a moment later loah stood
beside him

her eyes gave unmistakable
corroboration of what gor
had said of that torrent of tears
two thousand miles below



but she looked at dean bravely
while every show of emotion was
erased from her face you sent for
me she said

 and rawson though now he
knew he could speak to her and be
understood found himself at a loss
for words

 we wanted you with us gor
and i he began then paused she
was so different from the girl
whose smiling eyes had welcomed
him the change had come when
he spoke those first words on his
arrival and now she was so coldly
impersonal

 i wanted to thank you you
saved my life you were so brave
so    again he hesitated he
wanted to tell her how dear how
utterly lovely she had seemed

 it was nothing it has pleased
me to do it she said quietly then
walked on ahead while the others
followed but rawson knew that
that slim body was tense with re-
pressed emotion he had not real-
ized how he had looked forward to
seeing again that welcoming light
in her eyes he was still puzzling
over the change as they entered a
natural cave in the mountainside

 a winding passage showed be-
tween sheer walls of snow white
where giant crystals had parted
along their planes of cleavage
then the passage grew dark but he
could see that ahead of them it
opened to form a wider space
there were lights on the walls of
the room lights like the one that
loah had carried and on the
floor were rows of tables where
men were busy at work writing
endlessly on long scrolls of parch-
ment

he wise ones gor was
saying servants of the holy
mountain yet even then men
knelt at rawsons coming as had
the other more humble people they
then returned to their tables and

in that crystal mountain was only
the sound of their scratching pens
and the faint sigh of a breeze that
blew in through a hidden passage
to furnish ventilation

  yet there were some at those ta-
bles whose pens did not move they
seemed to be waiting expectantly
one of them spoke the time is
near he said are the servants
prepared

 and the waiting ones answered
we are prepared

 rawson glanced sharply about
what hocus-pocus is this he was
asking himself still the silence
persisted he looked at the waiting
men motionless their heads bent
their hands ready above the parch-
ment scrolls he saw again the
white walls the single broad band
of some glittering metal that made
a continuous black stripe around
walls and ceiling and floor

 what kind of ore is that he
was asking himself silently its
metallic it runs right through the
mountain i wonder-

  his idle thoughts were never fin-
ished a ripping crash like the
crackle of lightning in the vaulted
room then a voice-the mountain
itself was speaking-speaking in
words whose familiar accent
brought a sob into his throat

 station k-twenty-two-a said
the voice of the mountain the
super-power station of the radio-
news service at los angeles cali-
fornia

xts tuned in gasped rawson

 x tuned in on the big l a
station a gigantic crystal detec-
tor those heavy laminations of
imbedded metal furnish the induc-
tance then his incoherent words
ended-the mountain was speaking

sion of the mole-men has not been
checked army air force fought a
terrific engagement about midnight
last night and met defeat over

ciated with dean rawson in the
tonah basin where the mole-men
first appeared with colonel cul-
ver of the california national
guard smith was returning from
washington in an army dread-
nought which crashed back of the
enemys lines

  rawsons tanned face had gone
white he knew the others were
looking at him curiously all but
the men at the tables whose pens
were flying furiously across the
waiting scrolls before him the
face of loah suddenly wide-eyed
and troubled swam dizzily he
could scarcely see it-he was seeing
other sights of another world

  theyre out he half whispered
the red devils are out-and

      chapter xx
      taloned hands

simple pastoral folk the peo-
ple of the light in their inner
world a vanishing world where
nearly all of what once had been a
vast country was now covered by
the steadily encroaching sea they
had resisted the degeneration which
might easily have followed the de-
struction of a complex civilization
living simply and clean of mind
they had clung to the culture of
the past as it was taught them by
their wise ones and now the
people of the light had found a
new god

  not that dean rawson had asked
for that exalted position on the
contrary he had tried his best to

make them understand that he was
only one of many millions some
better some worse but all of them
merely humans

  his speaking the language of the
holy mountain had convinced them
first but when old rotan oldest
and grayest of the mountains ser-
vants went into a trance then
rawson could no longer escape the
honors being thrust upon him

  the time of deliverance is at
hand old rotan said when he
awoke his voice that so long had
been cracked and feeble was sud-
denly strong vibrant with belief in
the visions that had come to him

  they were in the inner chamber
of the white mountain where dean
rawson heartsick lonely and hope-
less had spent most of his time
listening to the voice from the
outer world gor was there and
loah and the writers had left their
desks to gather around old rotan
where now the old servant of the
mountain stood erect his glisten-
ing eyes fixed unwaveringly upon
rawson

  listen he commanded rotan
speaks the truth never shall the
people of the light return to the
outer world it is here we stay
for now our world which is lost
shall be returned to us his eyes
unnaturally bright met the wonder-
ing gaze of his own people gath-
ered around then came back to rest
again upon rawson

ean-rah-sun he said
 rah-do you not see
it is our own word rah-the mes-
senger dean-messenger of the
sun the sun-god has sent him-
he will set us free he will restore
our lost cities the people of the
light will spread out to fill the
new land they will multiply and
once more will be a mighty nation
living happily as of old in their
own lost world

  dean he called dean-mes-
two thousand miles below



senger of the sun he was drawn
to his full frail height his arms
outstretched but rawson saw the
old eyes close sensed the first
slackening of that tense body it
was he who sprang and caught
the sagging figure in his arms then
lowered the lifeless body to the
floor of crystal white

  even happiness can kill a feeble
heart can cease to beat under the
stress of emotions too beautiful to
be borne and rotan wisest of the
wise had passed on to serve his
sun-god in another world

 and thereafter rawson dean-
rah-sun was undeniably a god
but he wondered even then while
the others dropped to their knees
in humble worship why loah her
eyes brimming over with tears had
broken suddenly into uncontrol-
lable sobs and had rushed blindly
swiftly from the room

to rawson the unwavering sim-
ple faith of the white ones
was only an added misery rotans
vision was accepted by them un-
questioningly their adoring eyes
followed rawson wherever he went
while the children carpeted his
path to the holy mountain with
golden flowers

 and there rawson would sit
cursing silently his own helpless-
ness while the voice of the moun-
tain told of further devastation up
above his plans for leading a
force against the mole-men were
abandoned on the island all that
was left of this inner world were
only some two thousand persons
men women and children and the
children were few the population
had been rigorously kept down
their present number was all that
the island would support though
every possible foot of ground was
tilled

  only a handful of them raw-
son admitted despondently and
not a weapon of any sort theyve

kept by themselves only loah and
a few of the others had enough
curiosity and nerve to scout around
where the mole-men live she even
understands their talk lord what
id give for a thousand like her a
thousand men with her nerve
then with weapons and means of
transportation    but at that he
stopped aware of the futility of
all such thoughts

  he had tried to talk to gor tried
to tell him of his own limitations
and gor had only smiled pleas-
antly and repeated rotan has
spoken it will come to pass

  ceaselessly his thoughts revolved
about the hopelessness of his situa-
tion he was alone whatever was
to be done he must do single-
handed-and there was nothing he
could do but he would not admit
to himself that the aching lone-
liness came to a focus in the mem-
ory of a girls smiling eyes the
touch of her soft hand

  theyre fighting up there he
argued fighting for their lives
and i cant help what right have
i to think of loah or myself in
spite of which he sprang abruptly
to his feet left the mountain and
the voice of the mountain behind
him and went in search of the
girl

 ive got to make her under-
stand he exclaimed ive got to
have someone to talk to but i
cant make her out shes so con-
foundedly respectful-acts as if i
were a little tin god and yet-she
wasnt always that way

at the home of gor he found
loah slim and beautiful as
always she had just come from the
bath the creamy texture of her
skin had flushed to rosiness in the
cold fountain her jeweled breast-
plates sparkled a cloth that shone
like silk enwrapped her hips in
soft folds of pale rose and hung
in an absurd little skirt she might


astounding stories

have been the spirit of youth itself
a vision of loveliness yet rawson
felt an almost uncontrollable desire
to take her in his two hands and
shake her when she bowed humbly
and treated his request as if it were
a royal command

  to walk with dean-rah-sun
but certainly if that is his wish

  in silence they left the village
and walked toward the islands end
where rawson had emerged from
the underworld

  the island was not large on
either side were low hills mere
knolls of white crystal where in
every hollow men and women were
harvesting strange grain between
the two ranges of hills were flat
fields of green reaching out toward
the point some three miles distant

  rawson made no attempt to talk
as he led loah along the roadway
that cleft the green expanse in half
other workers were there and dean
acknowledged their smiling wor-
shipful salutations he did not
want to talk now he wanted to find
some place where he and loah
could be by themselves there was
so much he must tell her he must
try to make her understand and
after that perhaps with her help
he could find some way to be of aid
to his own beleaguered people-
something he could do even single-
handed

here the fields ended and
from there on toward the
point had been an expanse of glis-
tening white rawson remembered
it plainly so now when he found
it a place of flaming crimson he
stared in amazement across the
full width of the valley a brilliant
carpet had spread itself a covering
of flowers a blossoming vine had
sprung up in the few days since
his arrival and had woven a thick
mat of vegetation

  he wanted to go on out to the
extreme end of the point there

they would be alone but loah
objected when he started to enter
the red expanse

  no she said in quick alarm
we must not cross it is the
place of death we will go around
it following the hills

  we crossed it the other day
when it was a plain of white
salt argued rawson

  but now the flowers have come
even now it might be safe-but
when they die then nothing can
cross here and live

  loah could not give the reason
dean gathered from what she could
tell that a gas of some sort was
formed perhaps by the decompos-
ing vegetation perhaps it combined
with the sparkling white shale but
all this was of no consequence
compared with his own problems
he did not argue the matter but
followed where loah led

  where is the shell he asked
when they stood at last near the
open mouth of the great shaft into
which the air was rushing where
is the machine that we came here
in i wanted to see it-thought
perhaps i could use it later on

  the jana-the shell as you call
it-is safely locked in a great room
of gors house not all understand
its use it must be kept away from
careless hands

then rawson put that thought
aside he took loahs hand and
led her some distance away toward
the shore beyond a rocky crys-
talline mass where fragments had
been heaped the sound of the rush-
ing air was lost only the flashing
emerald waves whispered softly on
the shore beyond and there in
that quiet place under the bril-
liance of the central sun rawson
told her of himself and of the great
outer world he told her of his
work of everything that had hap-
pened of how he was only one of
many millions of men and women
two thousand miles below



like and yet unlike the people of
the light and at last he knew
that she understood

  he had spoken softly though he
knew there were no other listening
ears loah had been seated before
him on one of the white blocks
sh rose to her feet her eyes were
troubled vaguely he sensed behind
them a conflict of emotions

  i must think she said i will
walk by myself for a time then i
will return

 rawson reached for her hand
youre a good sport he said
huskily then he felt the trem-
bling of that hand in his and as
if it had been an electric current
his own body responded

  shaken in every nerve his poise
deserted him he could not think
clearly he knew only that that
horrible loneliness was somehow
gons by force of will alone he
kept his arms from reaching out
toward that radiant figure instead
he raised her hand toward his lips

  she withdrew it sharply no
she said our wise ones were mis-
taken for years they have listened
to the mountain they have written
down its words slowly they have
learned their meaning a kiss they
said was a symbol of love in your
world they were mistaken-as was
i now i will walk alone for a
time

rawson let her go she
seemed hardly looking where
she went her eyes were downcast
she moved slowly around the shel-
tering rock and on toward the level
ground and the rushing winds of
the shaft

 his own thoughts were in a
whirl too confused with emotion
for clear thinking a symbol of
love and back there in that cave
world she had pressed her lips to
his hand then they had come here
and he had been transformed to a
god a being who could never have

more than an impersonal affection
for one as humble as she

  the rising flood of happiness
within him was abruptly frozen
changed to something which filled
his veins with ice for from be-
yond the crystal barrier that hid
loah from his view her voice had
come in one single cry of terror
then dean she called dean
san but by then rawson was
throwing himself madly around the
barricade of rocks

  like a sensitized plate when the
cameras shutter is opened a merest
fraction of a second rawsons brain
took the imprint of every detail
that was there the black mouth of
the shaft and on the rock beside
it something metallic brilliantly
gleaming-a flame-thrower beyond
the pit was loah half crouching
her slim body tense as if checked
in mid-flight she had been running
toward him coming to warn him
and between her and the shaft his
back turned squarely toward raw-
son was the hideous figure of a
mole-man one of the reds his
grotesque pointed head was bent
forward toward the girl his arms
were reaching the long fingers like
talons

rawson did not know when
he called the girls name but
he knew the instant that he had
done it and he knew it was a mis-
take he should have crept quietly
seized the weapon-and now his
feet tore madly on the white rock
floor as he raced toward the shining
implement of death from beyond
the red figure whirling at his call
leaped wildly for the same prize

  the taloned hands were on the
flame-thrower first rawson saw the
red body straighten saw the weap-
on swing glistening in air swing-
ing over and down from its tip
green fire made a straight line of
light

  he leaped in under the descend-


astounding stories

ing flame felt the nozzle of the
projector as it crashed upon his
right shoulder and the green fire
spat harmlessly beyond his back
that last spring had thrown him
bodily against the red monster
they were both knocked off bal-
ance for a moment then rawson
caught himself and swung with his
left he set himself in that frac-
tion of a second felt the first move-
ment of that shining crook-necked
tube that meant the green flame
was being drawn back where it
could reach him then his fist
crashed into a yielding jaw

  not five feet from the brink of
that nearly bottomless shaft he
stood wavering in the rush of air
he knew that the ugly red figure
had toppled sideways that the
weapon had fallen with him the
blast swinging upward in a vertical
hissing arc-then man and weapon
had dropped silently into the pit

  he was alone save for the girl
who her eyes wide with horror
threw herself upon him and clung
trembling while she murmured in-
comprehensible endearments in her
own tongue wherein his own name
was mingled dean dear my own
dean-san

  but the mole-men dean raw-
sons mind was aghast with the
horror of it the mole-men had now
found the way

gordon smith sometimes
known as smithy was to re-

that followed the crash of the big
army dreadnought it was colonel
culver who dragged him from the

ver and one of the pilots whom he
had restored to consciousness they
lowered smithy carefully to the
ground then explored the rest of
the ship

 their hands were red when they
returned-and empty captain far-
rell and the rest of the crew had
ceased to be units of the united
states army air force henceforth
they would be only names on a
casualty list grown ominously long

 stood plumb on her tail said
the pilot staring at the wreck
they hit us just once and the
left wing crumpled like cardboard
last i remember was pulling her
up off the trees he stared at the
mass of twisted metal and the cen-
ter section where the wing had torn
loose it stood upright almost ver-
tical resting on the crushed tail

 funny said the pilot in the
same flat level tone that seemed
the only voice he had since that
last pull on a whipping wheel
damn funny-mostly we get it
first up there

 come here snapped colonel
culver lend a hand here with
smith weve got to carry him
and dont talk so loud-those red
devils will be out here any minute

smithy was taking a more
active interest in his surround-
ings when he sat a week later in
the governors office

 theres a detachment moving in
there from the south said the
governor were going to follow
your advice to some extent at
least were sending troops to
tonah basin if the top of that
dead crater is closed they will
blast it open then a scouting
partys going down call it a rec-
onnaissance call it suicide-one
names just as good as the other
colonel culver here is going but
you know the lay of the land there
you could be of great help how
about it

 are you asking me smithy
inquired

 he stood up flexed his arms
while he grinned at colonel culver
hinges all greased and working
two thousand miles below



as a flier colonel youre a darn
good first-aid man ill say that
when do we start

 which explains why smithy
some time later hidden under the
grotesque disguise of a gas mask
was one of fifty similarly attired
who stood waiting about the black
open maw in the great cinder-
floored crater of one of the peaks
that surrounded tonah basin

  night and the big stars that
hang so low in the black desert sky
should have been brilliant they
were lost now in the white glare
that streamed upward the crater
was a fortress around the circle of
the entire rim on the inner side of
the rough crags men of the th
field artillery stood by their guns
lookouts trailed their telephone
wire to the higher peaks where
they perched as shapeless as hud-
dled owls and like owls their
eyes swept the mountains slopes
and the desert at its base where
the searchlight crews played long
fingers of light incessantly-and
where nothing moved

  but the empty silence of the
desert was misleading as the men
in the crater knew

they had begun arriving with
the earliest light of morning
smithy had come in with the first
lot and when the first big auto-
gyro transport had settled and risen
again from the crater another had
taken its place and another and
many others after that

 that first crew had been a
machine-gun battalion and smithy
had smiled with grim satisfaction
at the unhurried way in which their
young captain had snapped them
into position without the loss of a
second and their guns smithy
noticed were trained inward upon
the crater itself

  inside that protecting circle the
other transports landed one by one
men mobile artillery ammunition

cases big searchlights and a dozen
engine-generator outfits the last
transports brought in strange cargo
-short sections of aluminum struts
with bolts and splice plates to join
them together blocks and tackle
and sheaves then spools of steel
alloy cable at least ten miles in
length

  from the last ship they took a
hoisting engine and an assortment
of aluminum plates and bars which
were bolted together by waiting
mechanics and which grew magi-
cally to a crude but exceedingly
substantial elevator on which fifty
men by considerable crowding
could stand

  only a floor of bolted plates with
corner posts and diagonal bracing
and a single guard rail running
around the four sides-but for the
first time smithy began to feel that
he was actually going down that
this was not all make-believe or a
futile gesture he would stand on
that platform he would go down

where dean had gone and then----

but what would come after he knew
he could never imagine

a little crane swung the first
metal work into position above
the shaft one end of the assembled
framework of aluminum alloy
dragged loosely on the ground the
other end swung out and projected
above the shaft swayed for an
instant-and then came the first
direct knowledge of the enemys
presence the end of a metal strut
though nothing visible was touch-
ing it grew suddenly white hot
sagged then broke into a shower
of molten dazzling drops that
rained down into the pit

  good said colonel culver who
was standing beside smithy now
we know they are there--but it
means we will have to go down
there with our gas masks on

  to smithy it was not immediately
apparent how gas masks were to


astounding stories

protect them from the deadly in-
visible ray he got the connection
of thoughts when a bomb was slid
over the edge the dull thud of the
explosion quickly came back to them

  they popped that one off in the
air-hit it with their heat ray said
a cheerful voice beside them but
the phosgene will keep on going
down give them another

  the interval this time was longer
now for a dirty crack said the
cheerful voice time this one

a youngster nearby snapped
a stop-watch as the bomb was
released he held some printed
tables in his hands odd receivers
from which no wire led were
clamped over his ears this time
the dull thud was long in coming
it was hardly perceptible when the
young man with the stop watch
announced fifty thousand feet
sir

  give em another time it again
a second high explosive bomb was
released

  fifty thousand feet sir

 good that measures it and
those last bombs have knocked the
devil out of whatever machinery
theyve got down there now well
give them a real taste of gas two
of the green ones there men put
ten miles of cable on the drums
get that hoisting frame into place
but night had come though
searchlights outside the crater and
floodlights within had robbed the
night of its terror when smithy
with culver beside him climbed
over the guard rail of the lift that
hung waiting just over the pit

 a gas mask covered his entire
face through its round eye plates
he looked at the others who crowd-
ed about him grotesque almost
ludicrous-twenty men armed with
clumsy sub-machine guns the
others would follow later a
searchlight was on a tripod at the
center and a spool of electric cable

  the light sizzled into life and
swung slowly about then the plat-
form jarred and the spool of cable
began slowly to unwind beside
him colonel culver was returning
the salute of an officer outside on
the ashy ground smithy raised his
hand but the brink of that pit had
moved swiftly up-there was noth-
ing before him but a glassy wall

 reconnaissance suicide one
word was as good as another but
he was going down-down where
dean rawson had gone-down where
there was a debt to be paid

chapter xxii

the red-flowering vine

otan said gor slowly
sadly was wrong his
vision was not the truth the red
ones have come and now-we die
without a fight rawson de-
manded incredulously

  we are not a fighting people
we have no weapons we can only
die

 rawson turned to loah they
were inside the mountain and the
servants of the mountain with ter-
ror and dismay written plainly on
their faces were gathered about
at the lake of fire said raw-
son when you saved me there
was an explosion and clouds of
white fumes what was it

  it was like water loah said
we found it deep inside the earth
in a place where it is very cold
when warmed it turns to white
clouds we threw a flask of it on
the hot rocks hoping to reach you
while they could not see-she
paused and shook her head slowly
-but we can get no more the
pathway of light is closed to us
now that the red ones are there
liquefied gas of some sort said
rawson briefly caught in enor-
mous rock pressure but thats out
now what about this place of
death theres an idea there
two thousand miles below



 the white ones were numbed
with fear but loah and gor ac-
companied him when rawson re-
turned to the red field the flowers
were still in bloom they waved
gently in the breeze that blew al-
ways from the mountain across the
fields and out toward the point
where even now dark figures could
be seen near the mouth of the shaft

  it will be many of your days
said loah before the flowers die
if you thought to trap the red
ones in the place of death there
will not be time   but rawson
had left them he had advanced
into the scarlet field and dropped
to his knees

he was crushing the vines in
his hands grinding them into
the white salty earth underneath
then he passed his hands guarded-
ly before his face as if to detect
an odor

  loah and gor saw him shake his
head slowly while he spoke aloud
words that they could not under-
stand cyanide dean rawson was
saying its a cyanide of some sort
-releases hydrocyanic acid gas i
could have rigged a generator
though ive forgotten about all of
my chemistry-and now there isnt
time off in the distance the dark
figures still moved near the end of
the point

  he made no effort to conceal his
dejection as he returned the edge
of the place of death made a
winding line across the scant half
mile of valley where the green
fields ended abruptly

  dean stepped high over the stone
trough a half mile long that marked
that dividing line there was water
in it it was part of their irrigation
system a little beyond in the
midst of the green stood a tiny
flat-topped knoll on which he knew
was a pool that supplied the crude
system beyond it loah and gor
were waiting

  gor read the look on rawsons
face it is useless gor said and
now i have decided the people of
the light must die-but not in
the fires of the reds with my
people i shall walk into the sea

  and rawson could not protest
he could only follow as gor turned
back toward the village and the
mountain beyond

from a spur on the mountain-
side rawson could see the full
length of the island one way lay
the village beyond it the green
fields then the wide scarlet band
of the place of death and be-
yond that the little crystal hills
and the valley between that led
out to the point it was now dark
with massed clusters of bodies red
even at that distance he could even
see the glint of metal from time to
time

 and behind the mountain were
the people of light where gor was
only waiting for the attack to lead
them out to the islands farther
end and then on to a kindlier death
in the emerald sea only loah was
with dean although there were
others of the white ones not far
away watching ready to warn gor
when the attack began

  not an hour before rawson had
stood in the inner chamber and
had listened to the mountain as it
repeated the words of a far-distant
man attack of the mole-men
growing increasingly ferocious   
heat-ray projectors-almost invinc-
ible    our forces have entered
the tonah basin-they are de-
scending into the crater but
whether warfare can be carried on
advantageously under ground is
problematical   rawson uncon-
sciously gritted his teeth behind his
set lips as he watched the reds

 he knew why they had been so
slow in attacking they must have
a carrier of some sort a shell like
that of loahs and they were


astounding stories

bringing their fighters one shell-
load at a time when the entire
force was ready they would attack
and rawson was convinced that
this force would be limited in num-
ber

  theyll have plenty to keep them
busy up there he argued if only
we could wipe out this one lot we
could prepare to defend ourselves
and now standing on the side of
the mountain he startled loah with
the fury of his sudden ejaculation

  fool quitter waiting here for
them to come and get you theres
one chance in a million- then he
was rushing at full speed along the
roadway that circled the mountain
toward gor and the terrified throng

the waiting savages must have
laughed if indeed laughter was
possible for such a race at sight of
the white ones creeping timidly
down off a mile and more they
could see them harvesting their
strange crop-harvesting-storing
up supplies of food no doubt
when the mole-men with their
flame-throwers would reap the har-
vest so soon

  but in a crimson field dean and
gor and loah led the others where
they swarmed across the place of
death gathering huge armfuls of
the red-flowering vine carrying
them to the village and returning
for more where they trod it was
as if peach pits were crushed be-
neath their feet and there was a
curious fragrance which rawson
told them not to breathe but to
keep their faces always into the
wind

  their hands and bodies were sore
and burned by the strong juice of
the vines they stopped often to
cast apprehensive glances at the
distant group of red figures and
always rawson drove them in a
frenzy of haste at last he made
them move the long trough of stone
beyond the edge of the green field

and over into the place of death

  rawson kept no track of the time
the voice of the mountain was his
only measure of hours in a world
of perpetual day but more hours-
another day perhaps-had passed
when the red force at last began
to move

they did not spread out wide
across the valley but formed a
straggling line that was denser
toward the center they could not
know what opposition they would
meet for the present they would
stay together above them as they
came were twinkling lights of pale-
green fire

  the radio had spoken of heat
rays rawson wondered if that
meant some newer and more hor-
rible instrument but he saw noth-
ing but the flame-throwers in the
armament of this force

  he was waiting by the irrigation
pool hidden for the moment be-
hind the little knoll loah was with
him he had tried in vain to induce
her to stay with gor and the others
who were waiting beyond the moun-
tain

  there were watchers some of
them within hearing whose voices
relayed the news of the enemys
advance then they ran panic was
upon them

  tur-gona they cried nu-
tur-gona we die quickly we
die rawson heard the shout car-
ried on toward the hidden throng

  cautiously he peered from the
little knoll they were coming al-
ready they were trampling the re-
maining red blooms on the farther
edge of the field but he waited till
they were halfway across before he
leaped to the top of the knoll
grasped a pole he had placed there
in readiness and rammed it down
through the pool turbid yellow
with the juice from the vines and
broke open the outlet he had
plugged in the base
two thousand miles below



one green light slashed above
his head one flicked at the
knoll near his feet where green
growing things burst into flame-
then he threw himself backward
down the short rocky slope while
the stones tore at his nearly nude
body he sprang to his feet and
held loah close on either side of
the knoll was a holocaust of flame
where green lights played he
waited breathlessly the fires
brought in a little back draft of
air the scent of peach pits was
strong-and then the green lights
ceased the unripe grain of the
fields smoldered slowly

  then rawson stepped from his
hiding and stared out at the place
of death

  nearby was a huddle of bodies
on either side in a long strag-
gling line they lay now on the
ground-a windrow where death
had reaped the flames of their
weapons still in action were all
that moved the white earth turned
molten wherever those flames struck

  farther off there were red things
that were running the yellow
liquid from the pool charged with
the acid of the vines had been
slow in flowing out through that
long trough the savages could
only see that their fellows had
fallen some mystery something in-
visible and beyond their compre-
hension had struck them they ran
toward the center at first then
turned and fled-and by then the
soft air blowing gently about them
had brought that strange fragrance
of death then they too lay still

  from the distance came faintly
a booming chant two thousand
voices raised in unison tut-gona
nu-tur-gona the last of a once
mighty people were marching to
their death

  rawson and loah turned with
one accord victory was theirs but
there was no time to taste the
fruits of victory they ran with

straining muscles and gasping
breath toward the distant moun-
tain and the marching host beyond

y plans are made rawson
spoke quietly i must go i
shall take the shell-the jana-and
go back to the mole-mens world
i shall go alone and i shall die
but what of that his eyes lit up
for a moment ill try to find
phee-e-al first if i can get him be-
fore they get me that will help

  they were standing on the moun-
tains lower slope gor and loah
and the servants of the mountain
gathered near below the white
ones were massed in worshiping
silence had not dean-rah-sun
saved them and now what else
would come to pass

  the same question had been asked
by the wise ones and now raw-
son turned and spoke to them ro-
tan was right he told them his
vision was true there is work 
must do here before i go your
lands or some of them at least will
be restored and you will be safe
forever from what we have seen to-
day gor will lead you wisely and
loah    his voice faltered he
had kept his eyes resolutely away
from the slim figure of the girl
who had been wordless scarcely
breathing now she stepped swift-
ly before him

 you must go dean-san she
said gently he knew it was a term
of endearment you must go if
you say you must but you do not
go alone nor die alone long ago
the voice of the mountain spoke
beautiful words i know now it was
one of your priests telling of a
woman of your own race always
have i remembered wheresoever
thou goest i shall go thy peo-
ple   

 but dean rawson had gathered
the slender figure starry-eyed and
sobbing into his arms

the passing of ku sui

            a complete novelette

     by anthony gilmore

like a projectile hawk carse shot out in a direction away from earth

chapter i

the plan

the career of hawk carse
taken broadly divides itself
into three main phases and
it is with the ku sui ad-
ventures of the second phase that
we have been concerned in this in-
timate narrative john sewell the
historian baldly condenses those
adventures of a

century ago to-
gether but on re-
search and closer
scrutiny they
take on an indi-
viduality and sig-
nificance deserving of separate
treatment and this they have been
given here for fictionized presen-
tation we have spaced the adven-
tures into four connected episodes
four acts of a vibrant drama

a screaming streak in the night-
a cloud of billowing steam-and
the climax of hawk carses spec-
tacular affair of the brains is
over

which ranged clear from saturn to
earth the core of which was the
feud between captain carse and
the power-lusting eurasian scien-
tist dr ku sui-that feud the re-
verbations of whose terrible set-
tling still echo over the solar sys-
tem-and in this last act of the
drama set out below we come to
its spectacular climax

 the words of john sewells epic
history sit lightly
on paper easy
words for sewell
once the collec-
tion of data was
over to write
not very signifi-
cant words for the uninitiated and
casual reader who does not see the
irresistible forces beneath them
but consider the full meaning of
these words and glance for a mo-
ment at the two figures conjured


astounding stories

up by them we see hawk carse
a man slender in build but with
gray eyes and lithe strong-fingered
hands and cold intent face that
give the clue to the steel of him
we see dr ku sui tall suave
unhurried formed as though by a
master sculptor in whose rare
green eyes slumbered the soul of
a tiger notwithstanding the cour-
tesy and the grace that masked al-
ways his most infamous moves
these two we see looming through
and dwarfing sewells words as
they face each other for they were
probably the most bitter and cer-
tainly the most spectacular foe-
men of that raw period before the
patrol ships swept up from the
home of man to lay earths laws
through space

  carse and ku sui adventurer
and scientist each with his own
distinctive strength and his own un-
yielding character-those two were
star-crossed fated to be foes and
whenever they met there was blood
and never was quarter asked nor
quarter expected how could it
have been otherwise ku sui con-
trolled the isuan drug trade and
carse was against it as he was
against everything underhanded
and unclean ku sui had tricked
and by a single deed driven
carses loved comrade master
scientist eliot leithgow from his
honored position on earth and
carse was sworn to bring ku sui
to earth to clear the old scientists
name either of these alone was
enough to seal the feud but there
was more carse was sworn to re-
lease from their bondage of life-in-
death ku suis most prized posses-
sion his storehouse of wisdom-
the brains of five great earth scien-
tists kept alive though their bodies
were dead

  these then were the forces
glossed crver so lightly by john

sewells words these the forces
that clashed in the episode set out
below that clashed then drew
apart and knew not one another for
years   

  

it will be recalled that in the
second of these four episodes
the affair of the brains hawk
carse eliot leithgow and the
negro friday broke free from dr
kus secret lair his outwardly in-
visible asteroid and in doing so
thought they had destroyed the
eurasian and all his works includ-
ing the infamous machine of coor-
dinated brains in the third episode
the bluff of the hawk it will
be remembered that the companions
came in dr kus self-propulsive
space-suits to satellite iii of ju-
piter and that there carse learned
that in reality the eurasian and
the brains had survived and that
dr ku might very possibly soon
be in possession of a direct clue to
leithgows hidden laboratory on
satellite iii we saw carse take
the lone course as he always pre-
ferred sending leithgow and fri-
day to his friend ban wilsons
ranch while he went to erase the
clue and we saw him achieve his
end at the fort-ranch of lar tan-
tril strong henchman of ku sui
and in brilliant carse fashion turn
the tables and escape from the trap
that had seemingly snared him and
proceed towards where fourteen
miles away leithgow and the
negro were waiting for him

  his three friends were waiting
very uneasily that day eleven
hours had passed since leithgow
and friday had parted from the
hawk and they had heard nothing
from him they knew he was going
into high peril leithgow had in
vain tried to dissuade him and so
it was with growing fear that they
watched the hours pass by

the passing of ku sui



  with ban wilson they sat near
dawn in the comfortable living
room of the ranchs central build-
ing although largely rested from
the ordeal of the journey to satel-
lite iii the huge negro was
fidgety and even leithgow more
controlled showed the strain by
continually raising his thin white
fingers to his lined face and strok-
ing it wilsons men were on watch
outside in the graying darkness but
often friday supplemented them
going to the door staring down to
the beach of the bordering lake
staring up to the skies staring at
the black and murmurous flanks of
the jungle-staring scowling and
returning to sit and look gloomily
at the floor

ban wilson was the most ac-
tive physically he was a
miniature dynamo of a man throb-
bing with a restless inexhaustible
tide of energy short and wiry he
stared truculently at the universe
through wonderfully clear blue
eyes surrounded by a bumper crop
of freckles and topped by a mat of
bristly red hair his short stub
nose had prodded into countless
hostile places where it most em-
phatically was not wanted it would
be hardly necessary to old acquaint-
ances of his to say that he was
now speaking

  no sir i say the hawks safe
and kicking cant kill him by
my grandmothers false teeth i
swear id follow him to hell know-
in id come out alive and leavin
the devil yowlin behind with his
tail tied into pretzels he said he
would meet you here well then
he will

  friday looked up mournfully

  yes suh capn ban but capn
carse was going into a powful lot
of trouble an he was worn an
tired an he only had a space-suit
an a raygun an you know he
wouldnt stop for anything till hed

done what he set out to i kind of
feel  i dunno  i dunno   
by betelguese swore ban wil-
son if he doesnt come soon ill
take that damned porno apart till
i find him

  eliot leithgow gave up the late
radio newscast from earth he had
been pretending to read a brief
silence fell and through it the old
scientist seemed to feel something
seemed to expect something and
he was not mistaken

 whos there

 it was a cry from one of the
watchers outside friday leaped out
of his uneasy seat and was through
the door even before ban who fol-
lowed with leithgow they heard
the negro roar from ahead

  capn carse capn carse sure
enough its capn carse-and
they saw his great form go bound-
ing down to the gray-lit beach of
the lake to a slight weary figure
that came stumbling along it

hawk carse had come as he
said he would but he was a
sore figure of a man though he
was not in it now for days he
had worn the harsh grating metal
and fabric of a space-suit and its
marks were left on him even from
a distance the others could see that
his once-neat blue trousers and soft
flannel shirt were torn through in
many places revealing ugly pur-
plish bruises on his haggard face
was a nap of flaxen beard and in
his blood-shot gray eyes utter ex-
haustion both mental and physical
the hawk had been acting at high
tension for days past and now the
reaction was exacting its inevitable
toll

  he came stumbling heavily along
the beach his feet dragging
through its coarse sand and it
seemed as if he would drop any
moment with a slight smile he
greeted friday then eliot leith-
gow and wilson all running down


astounding stories

  hello eclipse he murmured
and eliot-and ban-

  there he wavered and half fell
against the negros body friday
wished to carry him but he would
have none of it by himself he
walked up to the ranch-house
where he slumped into a chair
while ban wilson went shouting
into the galley for a mug of hot
alkite

  after draining it carse revived
slightly again aware of the three
men grouped around him and rec-
ognizing their eagerness for his
news he forced himself to speech

  sleepy-must sleep but-yes-
some things ill tell you in quick
staccato sentences his tired eye-
lids shut half the time he sketched
his adventure at lar tantrils
ranch explaining how even though
captured he had destroyed the fig-
ures telling of the location of
leithgows laboratory and a slight
smile appeared on his lips as he
told of the ruse by which he had
escaped got away told them the
lake-front was very dangerous to
them made them let me show
them i walked out-dozens of
them round me guns on me-
walked out till i went under water
could do it in the suit i walked
undef- water half a mile or so then
came up and cached the suit i
guess theyre still watching  easy

he chuckled and then after a
short pause went on

  but heres whats important-ku
sui is alive yes i know it he
has an assignation with tantril at
tantrils ranch in five days and
the coordinated brains i promised
to destroy-they still exist so
eliot these are orders prepare
plans for infra-red and ultra-violet
devices-they ought to do it-so
we can see dr kus invisible
asteroid when it comes friday
you go down and get my space-
suit its cached ten miles down the

beach beneath a big watzarl tree
and then- his head slumped
over he appeared to have abruptly
fallen to sieep

  yes carse what is your plan
eliot leithgow asked softly but
the hawk was only making a great
last effort to gather the threads of
his idea

  yes he responded the plan
ban stations a man to keep watch
on tantrils ranch while we go
back to your laboratory eliot
where youll make the devices and
repair the gravity-plates of my suit
then four nights from now if the
watchers seen no one arrive ban
friday and i return and lie in am-
bush round tantrils ranch await-
ing dr ku when he comes hell
surely leave his asteroid somewhere
near and while hes at tantrils
we capture the asteroid-and my
promise to the coordinated brains
will be kept

  then-but thats enough for
now i am so tired ban will you
please-some food-

  wilson who had been listening
eagerly and at the end grinning in
prospect of action with the hawk
darted off like a spark a few min-
utes later after his third mouthful
of food carse murmured

  well use your ship to go to
eliots lab in ban but i think
youll-have to-carry me-aboard
so sleepy wake me when we get
to-lab

  on this last word his sleep-de-
nied body had its way and at once
he was deep in the dreamless slum-
ber of exhaustion

  while he slept the others rapid-
ly carried out his orders within
two hours friday in the ranchs
air-car had retrieved the cached
suit ban wilson had manned and
made ready his personal space-ship
for the trip to the laboratory and
eliot leithgow had jotted down a
few preliminary plans for the in-
fra-red and ultra-violet instruments

ku sui

chapter ii
three figures in the dawn

the fourth night after the
hawk had met his friends at
ban wilsons was sunless and ju-
piter-less nor was there the slight-
est breath of wind and in the
humid dank jungle surrounding on
three sides the isuan ranch of the
venusian lar tantril the sounds of
night-prowling animals burst full
and loud making an almost con-
tinuous babel of varied and savage
noise

  in the midst of this dark inferno
tantrils ranch was an island of
stillness within the high guarding
fence the long low buildings lay
quiet and unlit brushed periodical-
ly by the light from the watch-
beacon high overhead as it swept
its shaft over the jungle smother
and then around over the black
glassy surface of the great briney
lake bordering the ranch enclosure
on the fourth side and vigilantly
the eyes of three venusian guards
followed the ray

  they stood on the three lookout
towers which reared at equal inter-
vals up above the circumference of
the ranch and though the build-
ings below seemed deserted in re-
ality wide-awake men were sta-
tioned at posts within them waiting
for the clang of the alarm which
the pressing of a button in any one
of the lookout towers would effect
lar tantrils ranch was not asleep
it was as alert and wary as the
beasts tracking through the jungle
outside its fence and all its de-
fensive and offensive weapons were
at the ready

  no one within the ranch knew it
but within two hundred yards lay
the foe lar tantril and his men
feared most

regularly around the watch-
beacon swept slicing the
blackness with an oval white finger
the farthest edge of which reached
a hundred and fifty yaids over the
western lake-and its inky rip-
ples sparkled somehow ominously
over the jungles confusion-and
trees great bushes spiky vines and
creeper-growths leaped into momen-
tary visibility and then were again
swallowed up in the tide of night
here a cutlas-beaked bird spot-
lighted for an instant froze into
surprised immobility with the
pasty bloated worm it had seized
twisting and dangling from its
mouth to flap squawking away as
the ray glided on there the coils
of a seekan in ambush on a tree
limb glittered crimson for the sud-
den moment of illumination or a
nameless huge-eyed pantherlike
creature was glimpsed as it clawed
at a nest of unfledged haris while
the frantic screaming mother beat
at it with wings and claws

  but all this was usual and un-
alarming merely the ordinary rou-
tine of the jungle at night could
the beacon have reached out an-
other fifty yards the guards on
their towers would have seen that
which was not usual-and would
have summoned every weapon of
the ranch beneath

  or could the guards have heard
besides the cries and crashings and
yowls of the jungle folk the man-
made sounds which sped silently
back and forth across the ranch
within their tight and secret radio
beams--then too the alarm would
have clanged

 had the beacon suddenly
stretched its path outward another
fifty yards it would have fallen
upon a massive leafy watzari tree
taller than most and the guards
looking close might have caught
in one notch of the trees many
limbs a glint of metal might have
seen had the light held on that


astounding stories

glint a bloated monster of metal
and fabric braced there hiding
behind a screen of leaves

  this giant not native to the jun-
gle was posted due north from
the ranch another waited to the
south in a similarly large tree
and another to the east

  hawk carse and his friends were
abroad again and waiting to strike

an wilson hot itching and
uncomfortable inside the
heavy space-suit that he wore and
supremely aware of his consequent
awkwardness watched the ranchs
beacon sweeping past him thirty or
more yards away and again sought
relief from the tedium in conver-
sation

  jupiter should be rising soon
carse its the darkest hour-seems
to me hell come now if he comes
at all what do you think

  he was the one posted in a wat-
zari tree south of tantrils ranch
flung on the tight beam of his
helmet-radio which had been tuned
and adjusted by eliot leithgow so
as to reach only two other radios
the words rang simultaneously in
the receivers of friday who was
east of the ranch and carse who
was north

  the hawk responded curtly

  i dont know when hell come
i suspect not before full morning
ban wilson grunted at receipt of
this discouraging opinion and then
once more as he had been doing
regularly all through the night
raised to his eyes the instrument
that hung by a cord from the neck-
piece of the suit through it he
scanned slowly and methodically
the portion of black heaven that
had been assigned to him the in-
strument would have resembled a
bulky pair of electro-binoculars
with its twin tubes and eyepieces
had not there been underneath the
tubes a small compact box which
by leithgow-magic revealed the

world through infra-red light by
one tube and ultra-violet the other

  nothing ban muttered to him-
self lowering the device and
damn ku sui for makin these
space-suits so infernally uncom-
fortable might as well have made
em space-ships while he was at
it say carse he began again
aloud into his microphone maybe
dr kus come already i know my
men said no one had arrived at the
ranch in a suit like these weve got
on-but hell if his whole asteroids
invisible why couldnt he make his
space-suit invisible too

 i dont think hes done that
otherwise he would have- the
adventurers level tone raised in-
cisively now both of you still
conceal yourselves with great care
-jupiters rising

the western horizon a mo-
ment before indistinguishable
was now faintly flushed a flush
which deepened quickly into glow-
ing riotous crimson causing long
streamers to shoot out over the
surface of the great briney tin-
gling it sparkling it the light
reached the jungle and when the
first faint reflected rays filtered
down through the matted gloom of
tree and vine and bush the crea-
tures that had tracked for prey all
night looked to their lairs and
gradually the tenor of the jungle
noises waned off into a few last
screams and muttered growls and
then died altogether into the heavy
brooding hush that comes always
with dawn over the jungles of
satellite iii

  jupiter thrust his flaming arch
upwards over the horizon and
climbed with his whole vast blood-
blotched bulk into a sky turned
suddenly blue lake and jungle
shimmered under the rapidly dissi-
pating night vapors the ranch-
beacon paled into unimportance
day had come
the passing of ku sui



 and now the three bloated fig-
ures of metal and fabric that were
men crouched closely back beneath
the leaves of the trees that con-
cealed them and waited tensely not
daring at first to move for fear of
discovery each one could see
through the intervening growth
the watch-towers of the ranch but
friday from his post in the tree
to the east could see the area
best and it was friday to whom
carses next words were addressed

  eclipse his terse voice asked
do the guards in the towers seem
to notice anything

  the big negro strained cautious-
ly for a better view

  no suh capn carse sure they
cant see us at all just pacin round
on their towers kind of fidgety
anyone else in sight

 no suh oh now theres
somethin two of the guards are
looking below cupping their ears
someone down there must be tellin
them somethin now theyre lookin
up to the sky-the northern sky
yes suh all three of em theyre
expectin someone sure enough
good he must be coming use
your glasses

then in all three trees the in-
struments that eliot leithgow
had shaped were raised and the
whole sweep of horizon and the
glowing clear blue dome of sky
subjected to minute inspection
through their detecting infra-red
and ultra-violet ban wilson per-
haps stared most eagerly for he
had never seen ku suis asteroid
and despite himself still only half-
believed that twenty craggy twist-
ed miles of rock could be swung as
its master willed in space and
brought down bodily to satellite
iii

 but he saw nothing in the sky
nothing looming gigantically over
any part of the horizon and he
reported disgustedly

nothing doing anywhere carse
dont see nothing either suh
the negros deep voice added and
both of them heard the hawk mur-
mur

nor do i but he must be- ah
there careful theyre coming
where where is it yapped
ban excitedly jerking the instru-
ment to his eyes again

  speak low not the asteroid
three men

  for a tense minute there was si-
lence between them until in a low
crisp voice the hawk added

  three men in space-suits like
ours coming from the north
straight for tantrils ban you may
not be able to see them till they
get to the ranch so you keep hunt-
ing for the asteroid with your
glasses friday you see them
yes suh three one ahead of
the others

  keep your eyes tight on them
no talking now from either of yu
unless its important

  the steely voice snapped off
and carefully in his tree hawk
carse brushed aside a fringe of
leaves and concentrated on the
three figures the dawn had brought

hard and sharp they glittered
in the flood of ruddy light
from jupiter great grotesque fig-
ures of metal and bulging fabric
with shining quarzite face-plates
and the abnormally large helmets
and boot-pieces which identified
them as being of the enemy at a
level fifty feet above the jungles
crown they came in fast horizontal
transit and there was much of
beauty in the picture that they
made-sparkling shapes flying with-
out sound or movement of limb
against the blue sky over the
heaped colors of the jungle below
one flew slightly in the lead and
he the watching hawk felt posi-
tive was ku sui and the other
two his servants-probably men


astounding stories

whose brains had been violated de-
humanized-mere machines in hu-
man form

  straight in the three figures flew
without hesitation or swerving
closer and closer to the watching
man in the tree the hawks lips
compressed as his old enemy neared
and into his watching gray eyes
came the deadly cold emotionless
look that was known and feared
throughout space wherever outlaws
walked or flew ku sui-so closet
there in that even-gliding figure
was the author of the infamy done
to leithgow of the crime to the
brains that lived though their
bodies were dead of the organized
isuan trade go for him now the
thought flashed temptingly through
carses head but he saw sense at
once far too dangerous with the
powerful watching ranch so close
he could not jeopardize the suc-
cess of his promise to the brains

  and so dr ku sui passed while
two pairs of eyes from two leafy
trees watched closely every instant
of his passing and one mans hand
dropped unconsciously to the butt
of a raygun

  quickly the eurasian and his
servitors were gone their straight
steady flight obscured by the trees
around tantrils ranch below which
they slanted

  dr ku sui had arrived at his
assignation but where was the
asteroid

through hi instrument
carse sought horizon and
heaven for the massive body but
in vain he spoke into his helmet-
radios mike

  ban

  yes carse

  see the asteroid anywhere
nowhere by betelgeuse ive
looked till my eyes-

 the hawk cut him short all
right stand by friday

  yes suh

can you see anything special
no suh-only that the three
platform guards keep lookin down
towards the center of the ranch

  good that means ku suis be-
ing received said carse and then
he considered swiftly for a minute
decided he continued

  ban and friday you both wait
where you are keeping a steady
lookout none of us can see the
asteroid but it must be somewhere
comparatively near for dr ku has
no reason to bother with a long
journey in a space-suit i think the
asteroids close down hidden by
that distant ridge in the direction
from which they came im going
to find it when i do ill tell you
where to come meet me inform me
at once if ku sui leaves or if any-
thing unusual happens under-
stood

  the assenting voices rang back
to him simultaneously

  right he said and slowly his
great bulging figure lifted

autiously the adventurer
made through the watzari tree
to the side facing away from the
ranch there poising for a second
he manipulated the lateral direc-
tion-rod on the suits chest and
still very slowly floated free from
the shrouding leaves then mind-
ful of the lookouts on the towers
behind he employed the tactics he
had used before and kept constant-
ly below the uneven crown of the
jungle gliding at an easy rate
through the leafy lanes created by
the banked tree-tops

  in that fashion in the upthrust
arms of the jungle twisting turn-
ing sometimes doubling but fol-
lowing always a path the objective
of which was straight ahead hawk
carse soared soundlessly for miles
he maneuvered his way with prac-
tised ease and his speed increased
as the need for hiding his flight
decreased
the passing of ku sui



  he was familiar with the land-
marks of the region and it was
towards the most pronounced of
them that he flew soon it was
looming far above him a long high
ridge rearing more than three miles
above the level of the great briney
and crowded with trees even taller
and sturdier than those of the
lower jungle plains beyond it was
the most likely spot

  the hawk paused at the base of
the ridge there had been no warn-
ing from ban or friday but to
make sure he established radio con-
nection

  friday he asked into the mi-
crophone any activity on the
ranch any sign theyre aware of
our presence

clear and deep from miles be-
hind the negros voice answered
no suh dead still i guess
theyre inside the buildings-except
the guards and theyre taking
things easy where are you suh
about ten miles from you
north and a little east at the foot
of the ridge i think ill know
something soon now stand by
then carse moved forward again
slowly winding up between the
trees to the summit of the ridge

  at the top he stopped his eyes
took in a long wide valley of
which the ridge where he hung was
the southernmost barrier he knew
at once something was wrong
through his opened face-plate he
was aware of a breathless hush that
hovered over the valley a hush
which embraced its fifty miles or
more of jungle length a hush
which was rendered actually visible
in several places by the unmoving
limp-hanging leaves of the trees
below in the valley all the myriad
life of the jungle seemed to have
frozen and only occasionally was
the pause of life and sound dis-
turbed by the faint muffled cry of
a bird

 what had wrought the hush

nothing showed to the naked eye

  from the summit of the ridge
hawk carse lifted leithgows
glasses to his eyes and the valley
was suddenly changed and the
hush explained the miracle lay be-
fore him

chapter iii

the raid

a dim shimmering outline
through the infra-red the val-
ley lay revealed as a great natural
cradle for a mammoth body of rock
which had been swung down from
the deeps of space to the surface
of satellite iii

  titantic breathtaking in its
majesty of sheer bulk the asteroid
of dr ku sui was made visible

  it hung suspended low over the
tree-tops of the valley and it filled
the valley with rock and towered
above it this was the asteroid
exploded into a separate entity by
the cataclysm that gave birth to the
planets which dr ku sui had
wrenched from the asteroidal belt
between mars and jupiter and built
into a world of his own swinging
it through space as he willed and
cloaking it with invisibility to baf-
fle those who marveled at how he
came and went unseen on his vari-
ous errands this was the mighty
rock fortress in which lay the key-
stone of his mounting power this
his lonely unsuspected home come
for a while to rest

hawk carse scanned it closely

  it lay roughly head-on to him
its nearest massive craggy end ly-
ing some three miles from where
he hung on that end lived the life
of the asteroid and were located all
ku suis works on a space planed
flat in the rock rested the dome
like an inverted quarter-mile-wide
bowl of glittering glasslike sub-
stance laced inside with spidery
supporting struts-the half bubble
from inside which men guided the


astounding stories

mass therein an artificial atmos-
phere was maintained even as on
any space-ship and there lay the
group of buildings chief of which
was the precious laboratory in
which were the coordinated brains
to whom the hawk had made his
promise

  carse lowered the glasses and
again the jupiter-light poured nor-
mally around him the valley hushed
and seemingly empty once more
he put through his call to friday
and ban giving them simple direc-
tions how to find him and twenty-
five minutes after that he saw
looking back down the ridge their
two giant metallic figures come
twisting and turning in noiseless
flight through the top lanes of the
jungle below and they were to-
gether

it was seldom that friday would
intrude his thoughts when with
his master and his masters friends
so when he arrived he merely sur-
veyed the asteroid through his
glasses and was silent but ban
wilson after a long comprehensive
stare during which one could al-
most feel the amazement leaping
through him sputtered

 by jumping jupiter carse-i
never wouldve believed it that
ku suis sure a genius to have
that whole asteroid there man and
to take it with him wherever he
wants to go look at it fifteen
twenty miles long it must be and
that dome-

  yes said the hawk shortly
but easy on that now weve work
to do and its got to be done quick-
ly now listen

  there are two main port-locks
in the dome for space-ships and
the starboard one has a smaller
man-size lock beside it were go-
ing to the smaller one therell no
doubt be a guard on watch at it
so to him were ku sui and the
two men who accompanied him

well have to chance recogntion
but at least theres no difference in
the suits were wearing and well
clasp our glasses on all the way to
the lock for surely dr ku has to
use some similar device keep your
faces averted as much as you can
though when near and your ray-
guns in your belts if theres to be
gunplay leave the first shot to me
youll both follow me just as those
two followed dr ku

  ban wilson asked will you go
down into the valley between the
trees then up the face of the rock
the guard wouldnt see us until
we were right at the lock

  no he wouldnt but hed won-
der why ku sui was being so cau-
tious well go straight across in
full view well get in easily or-
well that depends ready

  they fastened the glasses over
their eyes keeping the helmet face-
plates partly open the rayguns
they eased in their belt holsters
and slid back the hinged palms of
their mittens to give exit if need
be to their gun-hands they were
ready

  switching on the helmet gravity-
plates to swift repulsion the three
soared out of the trees soared up
on a straight inclined line for the
dome on the asteroid a steady
rapid climb that soon raised them
one mile a second and a third
where they leveled off and sped
straight ahead now they could
look right into the dome

  rapidly the port-lock that was
their objective grew in size be-
hind it were the buildings the
large four-winged eentral structure
and the supplementary workshops
and hangars coolie-quarters and
outhouses all dim and shimmering
through the infra-red-the mysteri-
ous lonely citadel of dr ku sui
there it all was inside the dome
with the rest of the asteroid loom-
ing massive behind

  a quarter-mile away and swiftly
the passing of ku sui



half that and half again the three
grouped figures arrowed ahead
without hesitation and the hawk
said curtly

  i see no men-do either of you
it looks deserted

  there cried ban after a sec-
ond there beside the port-lock
just now

beside the smaller port-locks
inner door a figure had ap-
peared clad in the neat yellow
smock of a servitor of ku sui it
was a smooth impassive oriental
face that turned to stare out at
the approaching men and even
ban knew that this sentinel sta-
tioned at the lock was one of the
coolies whose brains dr ku had
altered turning him into a me-
chanicalized man who obeyed no
orders but his he watched closely
the three who swept on towards
him his hand at a raygun in his
belt the same questions were in
the minds of all three of the raid-
ers would he recognize something
as being different or suspicious
would he summon others of his
kind from the small guard-box he
had come out of

  but the coolie evinced no alarm
it would have been difficult for
anyone to have discerned distin-
guishing features inside the cum-
bersome helmets behind the instru-
ments clamped to the faces of the
men who wore the suits he called
no others but merely watched

  soon the opaque metal plates of
the small locks outer door had
neared to within a few feet of
hawk carse and he stopped short
ban and friday following suit
they hovered there outside the
door gently swaying like flies
against the great gleaming sweep
of the dome the craggy rock face
dropping sickeningly down for
miles beneath them and like flies
they were powerless to open the
door to gain entrance only the

coolie inside could do that and he
through the dome to one side was
peering at them

  apparently he was satisfied with
his scrutiny after a moment bolts
shifted and the door stirred and
swung out revealing the all-metal
atmosphere chamber and the inner
door at the far side immediately
carse floated into the chamber and
the two others pressed in behind
they saw the outer door swing
shut and heard its locks thud
over

  they were sealed from sight in-
side the port-locks atmosphere
chamber

  looks to me whispered ban
wilson like a very sweet trap if
that fellow inside wants to-

  the hawks cool voice cut him
off

  we can take off the glasses
now he said casually keep
alert

  and for a full minute they
waited

at length a circle of light
showed around the rim of the
inner door and it grew quickly
into the full flood of jupiter-light
as the door opened

  carse floated through no longer
attempting to avert his face

  the coolie standing just outside
the chamber saw the adventurers
features and remembered-and drew
-the raygun in his belt

  carse did not shoot he never
killed unless he could not avoid it
this was as much a part of his creed
as his remorseless leveling of a
blood-debt he struck with the suit
under a quick turn of the control
the great heavy bulk of fabric-
joined metal lunged forward the
move was quick but not quite
quick enough for just before the
coolie was bowled headlong to the
ground he got out a high-pitched
warning yell and then as he lay
sprawled out apparently uncon-


astounding stories

scious a thin hot orange streak
sizzled by hawk carses helmet
from the left

 this time carse shot his gun
leaped from belt to hand and had
twice spoken from the hip before
one could quite grasp what had hap-
pened seemingly without bother-
ing to take aim his deadly left
hand had stricken into lifeless
heaps two coolies who had come
running and shooting from the
nearby guard-box

 as carse stood looking down at
their bodies he was startled by an-
other sizzling spit he wheeled to
see friday holding the raygun that
had spoken

  the negro said apologetically
sorry suh-i had to the other
coolie the one you knocked down
came to and was aimin at you
guess theyre all three dead now
sure enough

his master nodded and said in
a low thoughtful voice in
spite of what some men have said
i never like to kill but for these
robots more machines than men
with nothing human to live for
its release rather than death

 well he began again more
briskly were inside and whoever
else is here apparently doesnt
know it yet i expected more of a
commotion i wonder how many
coolies ku sui had altogether
fourteen or fifteen were killed
when we broke through the dome
before and now these three there
surely cant be many left of
course there are the four white
men his surgical assistants

  ban wilson spoke after what was
for him a long silence he had
watched the hawks gunplay with
an awe-stricken face its speed
never failed to amaze him he ob-
served

  these buildings certainly look
lifeless well what now carse
a search he planned it out

in his head then gave quick orders
ban he directed you go through
all the outbuildings your gun
ready the five main ones are a
workshop a power-house store-
house a ship hangar and a barracks
for coolies whoever you find take
prisoner keep in touch with me by
radio

  friday he continued im leav-
ing you here first get these bodies
in that guard-house they came out
of then keep sharp watch i dont
think ku sui will return within
fifteen minutes but we must take
no chance at the first sign of him
warn me

 yes suh but what are you
goin to do

  take over the central building
said the hawk and then when
the whole place has been recon-
noitered fulfil my promise to the
brains

  and what about ku sui
later he said it should not
be hard to take him prisoner
now enough

  the three parted

chapter iv
the voice of the brains

the central structure of the
group of buildings was shaped
like a great plus-mark each of its
four wings of identical square con-
struction with long smooth metal
sides and top and with a door at
the end giving entrance to a corri-
dor that ran straight through to
the chief central laboratory of dr
ku sui

  carse skimmed swiftly two feet
off the glittering metallic soil to-
wards the end of the nearest wing
where he gently landed he tried
the door giving entrance it was
open he cautiously floated through
into complete darkness

  the hawk was prepared for that
he drew a hand-flash from the belt
of his suit and standing motion-
the passing of ku sui



less his raygun ready in his left
hand he probed the darkness with
a long white beam spaced evenly
along the sides of the corridor were
many identical doors and at the
end a larger heavier door which
gave entrance to the central labora-
tory he found no life or anything
that moved at all so methodically
he set about inspecting the side
rooms

  the doors were all unlocked and
he moved down the line without
alarm like a mechanical giant pre-
ceded by a sweeping nervous flow
of light such he might from the
outside have appeared to be but
the man within himself was more
like a cat scenting for danger all
muscles and senses delicately tuned
to alertness door by door a cau-
tious and thorough inspection but
he found nothing of danger all
the rooms of that wing were used
merely for stores and equipment
and they were quite silent and de-
serted when he came at last to its
end carse knew that the wing was
safe

  he paused a minute before the
laboratory door he had expected
to find it locked and that he would
have to seek other means of en-
trance but it was not by pushing
softly against it it easily gave in-
ward on silent well-oiled hinges
he entered

carse found himself in a place
of memories and they were
sharp and painful in his brain as he
stood there here so much had hap-
pened  here death and even more
than death had been and was so
near

  the high-walled circular room
was dimly lit by daylight tubes
from above the damage he carse
had wrought when besieged in it
a week before had all been re-
paired the place was deserted-it
seemed even desolate-but in carses
moment of memory it was peopled

there had been the tall graceful
shape in black silk there the op-
erating table and the frail old man
bound on it there the four other
men white men and gowned in the
smocks of surgeons but whose
faces were lifeless and expression-
less dr ku sui and his four as-
sistant surgeons and his intended
victim master scientist eliot
leithgow

 they were all gone from the
room now but there was in it one
thing of life that had been there
before it lay behind the inlaid
screen which standing on roller-
legs lay along the wall at one
place the hawk did not look be-
hind the screen he could see under
it to know that no one lurked
there he knew what it was meant
to conceal there his promise lay

  but his promise could not be ful-
filled immediately there were four
wings to the building four doors
leading into the laboratory and he
had inspected but one

  an open door to his right re-
vealed a corridor similar to the one
he had reconnoitered he repeated
down it his methodical search and
found no one then he returned to
the laboratory

 surely there were men some-
where surely someone was behind
one of the two closed doors remain-
ing gun and flashlight still at
the- ready carse listened a moment
at the nearest one

  silence he grasped the knob
turned it and quickly threw the
door open a rapid glance revealed
no one wary and alert he passed
through and discovered that in
this wing were the personal living
quarters of dr ku sui

  the quarters were divided into
five rooms living room bedroom
library dining room and kitchen
and the huge metal figure passed
through all five the cold gray eyes
taking in every detail of the com-
fortable but not luxurious furnish-


astounding stories

ings there was a great deal of
interest to him but it would have
to wait

  he reentered the laboratory and
went to the remaining door bend-
ing hin head he again listened a
sound-a faint whisper he fancied
he heard something

  ready for whatever it was carse
pulled the door wide and before
him he saw the control room of the
asteroid and the men for whom he
had been hunting

they were white men carse
recognized them immediately
as the four assistants of dr ku
sui once they had been eminent
on earth respected doctors of
medicine and brain surgery leaders
in their profession now they were
like the mechanicalized coolies for
their brains too the eurasian had
altered divested of all humanity
and individuality so as to utilize
unhampered their skill with medi-
cine and scalpel

  they were clad in soft yellow
robes and seated at ease at one end
of a room crowded with a bewilder-
ing profusion of gauges machines
instruments screens wheels levers
and other nameless controlling de-
vices they did not show surprise
at the huge clumsy figure that
stood suddenly before them a ray-
gun in one hand like the coolies
their clean-cut features did not
change under emotion all they
did was rise silently as one gaz-
ing at the adventurer out of blank
eyes saying nothing and making
no other move

  carse tried simple measures in
dealing with them his voice gen-
tle yet firm he said

  you must not try to obstruct me
you have seen me before under un-
fortunate conditions yet i want you
to know that i am really your friend
i mean you no harm but you must
realize that i have a gun and be-
lieve that i will not hesitate to use

it if you resist me so please do not
i only want you to come with me
will you

 they were simple words and
what he asked was simple but
would the meaning reach these vio-
lated brains or would there instead
be the desperate reaction of the
coolies who had tried to kill him
carse waited with genuine anxiety
it would be hard to shoot them and
he knew he could not shoot to kill

 a moment of indecision-and
then with relief he saw all four
with apparent willingness move
forward towards him he directed
them through the laboratory and
without sign of resistance herded
them down the corridor he had
first searched to the outside

the light of jupiter flooding
undiminished through the
dome dazzled him at first when
he could see clearly he distin-
guished the great form that was
friday standing motionless by the
small port-lock and an equal dis-
tance away moving around one of
the out-buildings another similar
figure he spoke by radio

  find any ban

 cheerful words came humming
back

  only one coolie carse had no
trouble after i disarmed him hes
now locked inside a room in this
building safe place for prisoners
good said carse you can see
ive got four men-white men i
believe theyre unarmed and quite
harmless but i want you to take
them search them and put them
away in that room too
coming

  the distant form rose lightly
skimmed low over the open area
between and grew into the grin-
ning freckle-faced ban wilson he
bounced down awkwardly almost
losing his balance then surveyed
wonderingly the four assistants of
ku sui
the passing of ku sui



  by betelgeuse he muttered
-like robots hotrible

  yes said the hawk shortly
you had no trouble eh

  ban grinned again nothing to
mention this has been soft hasnt
it

  dont be too optimistic ban
all right-when youve put these
men in the room please relieve
friday send him to me in the lab-
oratory-he knows where it is-
and stand watch yourself if ku
sui appears-

  ill let you know on the in-
stant 

 hawk carse nodded and turned
back into the corridor from which
he had just come now he would
fulfil his promise with no possi-
bility of a surprise attack from
anyone within the dome and ban
wilson posted against the return
of ku sui he could attend un-
hampered to the vow which had
brought him there

he returned to the central lab-
oratory quickly he rolled
back the high screen lying across
one part of the curved wall and
stood looking at what was behind
it the monstrousness of that dead-
and-alive mechanism overwhelmed
his thoughts again

  before him stood a case trans-
parent hard and crystal-like as
long as a mans body and half as
deep standing level on short metal
legs what it contained was the
most jealously guarded the most
precious of all dr ku suis works
the very consummation of his
mighty genius his treasure-house
of wisdom as profound as man
then could know and more it held
the consummation of al that was
so coldly unhuman in the eurasian
for there in that case he had
bound to his will the brains of five
of earths greatest scientists and
kept them alive with their whole
matured store of knowledge sub-

servient to his need although their
bodies were long since dead and
decayed

 for some time the adventurer
stood lost in a mood of thoughts
and emotions rare to him-until he
was startled back into reality by a
heavy clumping noise coming
down the corridor through which
he had entered his gun-hand flick-
ered to readiness but it was only
friday coming as he had been or-
dered carse greeted the negro
with a nod and said briefly

  theres a panel in this room-
over there somewhere-you remem-
ber-the place through which ku
sui escaped when we were here
before its an unknown quantity
so i want you to stand watch by
it open your face-plate wide and
warn me at the slightest sound or
sight of possible danger

  the negro nodded and moved as
silently as was possible in his
space-suit to obey and carse
turned again to the thing to which
he had made a promise

the icy-glittering case was full
of a colorless liquid in which
were grouped at the bottom sev-
eral delicate colored instruments
all interconnected by a maze of
countless spidery silver wires
sheathes of other wires ran up
from the lower devices to the cases
main content-five grayish con-
voluted mounds that lay in shallow
pans-five brutally naked things
that were the brains of scientists
once honored and eminent on
earth

  their bodies had long since been
cast aside as useless to the ends of
ku sui but the priceless brains
had been condemned to live on in
an unlit unseeing deathless exist-
ence machines serving the man
who had trapped them into life in
death alive-and with stray mem-
ories which ku sui could not ban-
ish entirely of earth of love of


astounding stories

the work and the respect that had
once been theirs alive-with an
unnatural and horrible life without
sensation without hope alive-and
made to aid with their knowledge
the man who had brought them
into slavery unspeakable

  hawk carses eyes were frigid
gray mists in a graven expression-
less face as he turned to the left of
the case and pulled over one of the
well-remembered knife switches a
low hum came a ghost of rosy
color diffused through the liquid
in the case the color grew until
the whole was glowing jewel-like
in the dim-lit laboratory and the
narrow tubes leading into the un-
dersides of the brains were plainly
visible something within the tubes
pulsed at the rate of hcart-beats
the stuff of life

 when the color ceased to in-
crease carse pulled the second
switch and moved close to the
grille inset in a small panel above
the case

  slowly gently he said into the
grille

  master scientist cram profes-
sors estapp and geinst doctors
swanson and norman-i wish to
talk to you i am captain carse
friend of master scientist eliot
leithgow some days ago you aided
us in our escape from here and in
return i made you a promise do
you remember

  there was a pause a silence so
tense it was painful and then
functioned the miracle of ku suis
devising there came from the
grille a thin metallic voice from
the living dead

  i remember you captain carse
and your promise

a voice from living brain
cells through inorganic lungs
and throat and tongue a voice
from five brains speaking for
some obscure reason which even ku
sui could not explain in the first

person and setting to mechanical
words the living pulsing thoughts
that sped back and forth inside the
case and were coordinated into
unity by the master brain which
had once been in the body of mas-
ter scientist cram a voice out of
nothingness a voice from what
seemed so clearly to be the dead
to hawk carse man of action it
was unearthly it was a miracle the
fact of which he could not ques-
tion but which he could not hope
to understand and well might it
have been unearthly to anyone
even to-day

  still thrilling to the wonder of
it he went on

 i have returned here to the
asteroid with friends primarily i
came to keep my promise to you
but i intend to do more dr ku
sui is not here now and will not
be for at least fifteen minutes but
when he does return i am going
to capture him i am going to take
him alive

  he was silent for a moment
perhaps you do not know he
continued levelly but the people
of earth hold master scientist
eliot leithgow responsible for
your disappearance he is therefore
a fugitive and there is a price on
his head it is my purpose to re-
store eliot leithgow to his old
place by returning dr ku to earth
to answer for the crimes he has
effected on you

 i am now ready to fulfil my
promise to you i expect no inter-
ruption this time i regret exceed-
ingly my inability to destroy you
when i was here before but i sim-
ply could not in the little time i
had i still do not know how best
to go about it perhaps you will
tell me i will wait

  an afterthought came to him he
added into the grille

 there is no hurry your ex-
traordinary position-your thoughts
-i understand
the passing of ku sui



  then there was a long science
for once the hawk was not impa-
tient in fact there was in him the
feeling that the pause was only
decent and fitting for before him
were the brains of five great scien-
tists who as captive remnants of
men had asked him to end their
cold and lonely bondage limbless
his was to be the hand of their self-
immolation the present silent
slow-passing minutes were to be
their last of consciousness

  and then at last spoke the voice
captain carse i do not wish
you to destroy me i wish you to
give me new life i wish you to
transplant me within the bodies of
five living men

the words so unexpected took
hawk carse by perhaps the
greatest surprise he had ever
known for a time he was com-
pletely astounded he could hardly
credit his ears it required a full
minute for him to summon even the
most halting reply

  but-but could that be done
he strove to collect himself to
consider logically this course that
he had never dreamed would be
requested who could do it i
know of no man

  dr ku sui could transplant
me

 ku sui he could but he
wouldnt he would destroy you
rather

  almost immediately the artificial
voice responded

  you have said captain carse
that you will soon have ku sui
captive will you not attempt to
force him to do as i desire

  carse considered the suggestion
but it did not seem remotely pos-
sible ku sui could not be pre-
vented from having endless oppor-
tunities for destroying the brains
while enjoying the manual freedom
necessary to perform the operations
of re-embodying them

  i do not see how he began-
and then he cut off his words ab-
ruptly

  something had come into his
mind a memory of something eliot
leithgow had told him once long
before slowly the details came
back in full and at their remem-
brance his right hand rose to the
odd bangs of flaxen hair concealing
his forehead and began to smooth
them and a ghost of a smile ap-
peared on his thin lips

 perhaps he murmured i
think    perhaps   

  he said decisively into the
grille

  yes i think its quite possible
that i can force ku sui to trans-
plant you into living bodies i
think-i think-i cannot be sure-
that it can be done at least i will
make a very good attempt

  the toneless mechanical voice
uttered

  captain carse you bring me
hope my thoughts are many and
they are grateful

 but the hawk had made a prom-
ise and had to be formally freed
of the duty it entailed

  you release me then he asked
from my original promise to de-
stroy you

  i release you captain carse
and again i thank you

  the adventurer returned the
switches motivating the case and
the faint smile returned to his lips
at the thought that had come to
him

  but the smile vanished suddenly
at the quick excited words that
came crackling into his helmet re-
ceiver

  carse carse do you hear me
he threw over his microphone
control

  yes ban what is it

  come as fast as you can just
caught sight of three distant fig-
ures flying straight towards here
its ku sui returning


astounding stories

chapter v

my congratulations captain
carse

a few minutes later the trap
was in readiness

  it had been swiftly planned and
executed and it promised well
both the inner and outer doors of
the smaller port-lock lay ajar hawk
carse was gone from view the
only figure visible there was that
which lay sprawled face-downward
on the ground close to the inner
door of the port-lock

  the figure seemed to have been
stricken down in sudden death it
was clad in the trim yellow smock
of a coolie of ku sui it was limp
its arms and legs spreadeagled and
it lay there as mute evidence that
the dome of the asteroid had been
attacked

  to one entering from outside the
figure was that of a dead coolie
the coolie that had worn those
clothes was dead his clothes now
covered the wiry length of freckle-
faced ban wilson

  ban played the game well his
face lay in the ground pointed
away from the lock so he could
not see what was going to happen
behind him but before the hawk
had directed him to take off his
suit and don the yellow smock he
had glimpsed rising swiftly over
the southernmost barrier of hills
that edged the valley three black
dots coming fast toward the aster-
oid in straight disciplined flight
and he knew that the leader of the
three was dr ku sui

  as he lay limp on the ground
playing his important part as the
decoy of the trap he knew that his
life depended on the action and
the skill and the timing of hawk
carse but he did not worry about
that he had implicit faith in the
hawk and trusted his life to hi
judgment without a tremor

still it was hard for ban to

throttle down his excessively nerv-
ous nature and maintain the dead
man pose for the long silent min-
utes that crawled by before there
came any sound from behind the
jupiter-light flooding down on him
from the glittering blue sky above
was hot and growing hotter and
of course he began to itch had he
had the freedom of his limbs he
would not have itched he knew
it happened only when he had to
keep absolutely still he cursed the
phenomenon to himself minute
after minute and no sound to tell
him what was happening behind or
how close the three approaching
figures had come or whether carse
was at all visible or not-and the
mounting maddening itch right in
the middle of his back

at last bans mental cursings
stopped his straining ears
had caught a sound

 it was quickly repeated and
again and again-the heavy grating
noise of metal on metal the boots
of space-suits on the metal floor of
the port-lock they had arrived

  ku sui would be there close be-
hind him probably gazing at his
outflung figure probably puzzled
and suspicious and quickly looking
around for the enemies that had
apparently killed one of his coolies
with a raygun in hand-and guns
in the hands of the two others
with him-glancing warily around
over the guard-chamber close to the
port-lock and the main buildings
beyond and the whole area inside
the dome and seeing no one

 and then-approaching

  ban could tell it by the silence
then the harsh crunch of the great
boots against the powdered metal-
lic upper crust of ground but he
lay without an eyelashs flickering
a dead coolie limp crumpled he
heard the crunch of boots come
right up to him and then pause
and the feeling that came to his
the passing of ku sui



stomach told him unmistakably that
a man was looking down on him

 now-while ku suis attention
was on him-now was the time
now otherwise the eurasian
would turn him over and see that
he was white

  it seemed to ban centuries later
that he heard the welcome voice of
the hawk bark out

  you are covered dr ku and
your men i advise you not to move
tell your men to drop their guns-
ah

  the sound of the voice from the
guard-chamber was replaced by two
spits of a raygun unable to re-
strain himself ban rolled over and
looked up

  he saw first the figure of the
hawk carse had stepped out from
where he had been concealed in
the guard-chamber and was hold-
ing the gun that had just spoken
standing upright close to the
inner door of the port-lock were
two suit-clad coolies ban saw that
they had turned to fire at carse
and that now they were dead dead
on their feet in the stiff heavy
stuff of their suits

  dr ku sui was standing motion-
less above him and through the
open face-plate of the eurasians
helmet ban could see him gazing
at hawk carse with a strange faint
smile on his beautifully chiselled
ascetic face

 the hawk came towards them
the raygun steady on his old foe
but while he was still yards away
and before he could do anything to
prevent it the eurasian spoke a
few unintelligible words into the
microphone of his helmet-radio
carse continued forward and
stopped when a few feet away dr
ku bowed as well as he could in
his stiff suit and said courteously
in english

  so i am trapped my congratu-
lations captain carse it was very
neatly done

the two puffed-out metal-
gleaming figures faced each
other for a moment without speak-
ing and in the silence ban wil-
son watchful with a raygun he
had drawn from his belt fancied
he could feel the long bitter
bloody feud between the two ad-
venturer and scientist there met
again

  carse spoke first his voice steel-
cold

  you take it lightly dr ku do
not rely too much on those words
you spoke in chinese i could not
understand them-but such things
as i do not know about your aster-
oid i have already guarded against
and i think we can forestall what-
ever you have set in action   
you will please take off your space-
suit

  willingly my friend

 watch close ban said the
hawk

  dr ku sui unbuckled the heavy
clamps of his suit unscrewed the
cumbersome helmet and in a mo-
ment stepped free as the suit slid
to the ground there stood revealed
his tall slim-waisted form clad in
the customary silk he wore a high-
collared green silk blouse tailored
to the lines of his body full
trousers of the same material and
pointed red slippers and red sash
which set the green off tastefully
a lithe silky figure and above the
silk the high forehead the saffron
delicately carved face the fine
black hair half-veiled by their
long lashes his exotic eyes rested
like a cats on his old enemy

 the hawk moved close to him
and swiftly patted one hand over
his body from inside one of the
blouses sleeves he drew a pencil-
thin blade of steel from its hidden
sheathe he found no other weapon
stepping back he quickly divested
himself of his suit also

  and now captain the eura-
sian murmured softly


astounding stories

  now dr ku answered carse
once again a slender wiry figure in
soft blue shirt and blue denim
trousers we are going to have a
little talk in your living room i
think

  ban he continued i dont be-
lieve theres anyone else who can
even see the asteroid but we have
to be careful will you stay on
guard here by the port-lock good
close its doors and yell or come
to me if anything should occur

  he turned to the waiting eura-
sian again

  you may go first dr ku into
the laboratory and then to the liv-
ing room of your quarters

they found friday on guard
where he had been stationed in
the laboratory the big negro on
recognizing the eurasian grinned
from ear to ear and gave him what
he considered a witty greeting

  well well he said with gusto
-come right in dr ku sui make
yourself at home suh sure glad
to have you come visitin us he
laughed gleefully

 but his words were wasted on
dr ku his eyes at once fastened
on the case of coordinated brains
standing at one side carse noticed
this

  no dr ku he said i have
not touched the brains not yet
but thats what were going to talk
about he motioned to one of the
four doors connecting the central
laboratory with the buildings
wings into your living room
please and be seated there and no
sudden moves of course i have a
certain skill with a raygun friday
keep doubly alert now better take
off your suit i will call for you in
a few minutes

  ku sui walked on silent feet into
the first division of his personal
quarters the softly-lit living room
a lush velvet carpet made the floor
soft ancient chinese tapestries hid

the pastelled metal of the walls
books were everywhere it was a
quiet and restful room with no vis-
ible reminder of the asteroid and
its controlling mechanics

 dr ku sank into a deep arm-
chair linked his fingers before him
and looked up inquiringly

  we were going to talk about the
brains he asked

carse had closed the door be-
hind him and now remained
standing he met the masked green
eyes squarely

  yes he was silent for a little
then quietly and coldly he went to
the point

  youll be interested to hear that

i	have talked with the brains and
been relieved of my promise to de-
stroy them they requested some-
thing else now i have committed
myself to attempt their restoration
into living bodies

 so murmured the eurasian
so yes captain that is very in-
teresting

 very the hawk spoke with-
out trace of emotion and some
courtroom on earth will find more
than interesting the testimony of
your re-embodied brains

 dr ku sui smiled in answer
oh no doubt but my friend-
this transplantation-you accept its
possibility so casually wont it
prove rather difficult for you who
have never even pretended to be a
scientist

  not difficult impossible

 and master scientist eliot
leithgow- i have unbounded re-
spect for his genius but brain sur-
gery is a specialty and i really
think that this task would be out-
side even his capabilities i am sure
he himself would admit it

 you are right dr ku he has
admitted it we both realize there
is only one person in the universe
who could achieve it-you so you
will have to perform the operations
the passing of ku sui



  well- said dr ku sui the
smooth fine skin of his brow wrin-
kled slightly as he gazed up at the
intent man facing him is this just
stupidity on your part captain or
do you attempt a joke at which in
courtesy i should smile

  the hawk answered levelly i
was never farther from joking in
my life

ith a delicate shrug of his
silker shoulders ku sui
averted his eyes as if bored he
glanced around the room slowly
he unclasped his hands

  i am a very fast shot dr ku
whispered carse you must not
make a single move without my
permission

 at that the eurasian laughed
aloud a liquid laugh that showed
his even teeth between the finely
cut lips

  but i am so completely in your
power captain carse he held
on to the last syllable a low sus-
tained hiss-and then he snapped it
off

 s-s-stah his mood had
changed the smile vanished from
a face suddenly thin and cruel the
green eyes unmasked to show in
their depths the tiger

  what insane talk you say such
things to me dont you know that
to coordinate those brains i worked
for years with a devotion a con-
centration a genius you can never
hope even to comprehend dont
you realize theyre the most pre-
cious possession of the greatest
surgeon and the greatest mind in
the universe dont you under-
stand that ive fashioned a miracle
realize these things then and mar-
vel at yourself-you who with
your gun and your egotism think
you can make me undo their won-
derful coordination

  the tiger returned behind the
veil its power and fury again
leashed and dr ku sui relaxed

his green eyes once more masked
and enigmatic hawk carse asked
simply

 could you transplant the
brains

  you insist on continuing this
farce murmured the eurasian i
would not be rude but really you
try my patience

 could you transplant the
brains

  dr ku sui looked at the color-
less face with its eyes of ice with
a trace of irritation he said

 of course what i have once
transplanted i can transplant again
but i will not do it-and my will
no one and no force can alter
perhaps it is clear now in no way
can you touch my will i am sorry
that i so grossly insulted you
carse for there are certain things
about you that in a small way i
respect but here you are helpless

  not entirely said the hawk

ku sui leaned forward a trifle
in that moment perhaps he
first felt real concern for carses
quiet voice was so confident so as-
sured he attempted to sound him
out

 a gun he asked torture
threats these against my will
absurd consider my friend-even
if i seemed to consent to the opera-
tions could i not easily destroy
the brains while ostensibly work-
ing on them

 of course said carse with a
faint smile and threats and tor-
ture would be absurd against your
will dr ku a more powerful
weapon will have to be used

  the eurasians eyes were bril-
liant with intuition

  ah-i see he murmured eliot
leithgow

  yes dr ku

 the two gazed at each other
carse still with the faint smile
the other with the face of a statue
presently the adventurer went on


astounding stories

  unfortunately for you eliot
leithgow can provide a method of
compulsion neither you nor any
other man could ever resist not
guns torture threats-no a sub-
tler weapon worthy of your fine
will

  as he spoke carse saw the eura-
sians green eyes narrow and in
the pause that followed he knew
that the swift trained mind behind
those eyes was working what
would it evolve what move and
those chinese words uttered out
by the port-lock-what would they
result in and when dr ku sui
was concerned now the hawk
knew seriously concerned and in-
evitably would take serious steps
what was growing in his resource-
ful brain he would have to ward
off any trouble when it came for
he could not know now he said
curtly

  but enough of that now i have
a trifling favor to ask of you-
something concerning the labora-
tory will you please return to it

  a strange light glimmered for
an instant in dr ku suis eyes-
a mocking of the slender man be-
fore him only for an instant then
it was gone gracefully he raised
his tall figure

  the laboratory of course my
friend and as for the favor-al-
most anything

       chapter vi
       the deadline

friday greeted them with an-
other wide grin and would
again have bludgeoned the eurasian
with his wit had not the hawk mo-
tioned him to silence looking at
dr ku he said

  i have friday posted here be-
cause of the secret panel some-
where in this wall you escaped
through it before-do you remem-
ber

  of courge i remember and if

id had merely a fraction of your
luck then my present situation
would be quite different

  perhaps said the hawk this
panel is now the unknown quantity
so far as im concerned and i dont
like unknown quantities so i am
asking you to show me where it is
and how it works thats my favor
of course you can refuse to re-
veal it but that will not delay me
very long the method of compul-
sion i mentioned

  dr ku sui appeared to reflect a
moment but his decision was not
tardy in coming he smiled

  you terrify me captain with
your ominous hints about compul-
sion i suppose id better be reason-
able and show it to you really
though your concern over the panel
is rather wasted inasmuch as it
conceals nothing more than a small
escape passage leading out of this
building nothing important at all
but his words carse somehow
felt were a screen something else
lay beneath them he watched the
tall figure with its always present
odor of tsin-tsin blossoms move
forward in a few indecisive steps
then back again considering the
smile and the easy words were a
camouflage surely-but for what

  nothing important at all dr
ku sui repeated pleasantly come

i	will show you friday-if i may
so address you-over on that
switchboard you will find a small
lever-control it is the one with a
chinese character above it will
you be so kind as to throw it
the negro glanced inquiringly at
his master grimly carse nodded

  an enigmatic light glimmered in
the eurasians green eyes as they
watched the negro go to the
switchboard and put thumb and
forefinger on the control

  only a small escape passage
he said deprecatingly as the hawk
crouched gun ready his eyes on
the suspected place in the wall
the passing of ku sui



  friday threw the switch
immediately there sounded a
short sharp explosion and acrid
smoke billowed out from under the
case of coordinated brains

carse sprang to ku sui
gripped one arm and cried
harshly

  what have you done

  not i captain-your obedient
servant the black please your fin-
gers- he removed them from his
arm and then smiling he said

  i am afraid that all your assur-
ance your threats are now but so
much wasted breath

  you mean-

  surely captain said ku sui
you must have known i would
provide for such an emergency as
this i chose not to risk your dark-
ly-hinted method of compulsion
and so had friday remove the need
for it the chinese character above
the switch stands for death 
frigidly the hawk asked
youve destroyed the brains

  i have destroyed the brains
the eurasians voice was deep with
a strange unusual tone no mat-
ter it was time i am far far
ahead of that work great though
it was it has destroyed itself with
its inherent irremediable fault
yes far ahead next time he
appeared to lapse into profound
and melancholy reflections seemed
to forget entirely the two men by
him

  but the hawk acted

  well see he said curtly fri-
day watch the doctor closely this
trick may be only the first an
intent grim figure he strode to the
case of coordinated brains pulled
over the first of its two controlling
switches and stood silent while
slowly the pulsings of light grew
through the inner liquid and very
slowly irradiated the five gray
naked mounds that were human
brains the light came to full and

carse threw over the second switch
he said into the grille

  i am captain carse i wish to
know if you are aware of what has
just happened do you hear me
and did you feel anything a min-
ute ago

silence friday close to the
eurasian and watchful hung
breathless hoping that words might
come from the grille in answer
but the silken figure he watched
was there only in body dr kus
mind was in a far space of his own
cold unhuman words spoke out
yes captain carse i hear you
i felt the vibrations of the explo-
sion that occurred a minute ago

  hah grunted friday immense-
ly relieved all bluff suh no
damage to em at all

  carse asked quickly into the
grille

  you felt the explosion but do
you know what it meant-what it
did

  again a pause and again the
toneless voice

  a vital part of the machinery
through which i live has been de-
stroyed i have left only some
three hours of life

  the hawk returned to ku sui
is that true he snapped

  yes captain the words made
a whisper gentle and melancholy
coming from afar a man was turn-
ing back from the scanning of the
long years of one phase of his life
three hours is all that is left to
them    but there was a fault
inherent in such coordinated
brains it is just as well that they
are going    ah carse i am so
far ahead of you  but i tell you
it is a painful thing to destroy so

wonderful a work of my hands

  silence filled the laboratory it
was broken by the awful voice of
the living dead

  i release you from your second
promise captain carse no doubt


astounding stories

what happened was beyond your
control---- will soon be dead al-
though there is still nourishment
in my liquid  grow weaker al-
ready i am dying----

 harshly the hawk asked a final
question into the grille

 within what time will you re-
tain the vitality necessary to un-
dergo the initial steps of the trans-
planting operations do you
know

  dr ku raised his head at this
though he seemed only mildly in-
terested in what the reply would
be

  i think for two of the remaining
three hours

  all right said hawk carse de-
cisively he threw off the cases
switches dr ku he said youve
only succeeded in accelerating
things now for speed friday
were taking this asteroid to eliot
leithgows laboratory go see that
the port-lock doors are closed tight
then you and wilson hurry back
here fast run

chapter vii
to the laboratory

hen the negro returned
panting with ban wilson
it was to discover carse in the con-
trol room of the asteroid he was
studying the multifarious devices
and instruments and they seeing
his face so set in concentration
did not disturb him but went over
to where dr ku sui sat in a chair
and posted themselves behind it

 the apparatus in the control
room resembled that of any mod-
ern space-ship of its time except
that there were extra pieces of un-
guessed function directly in front
of carse was the directional space-
stick above its complicated mech-
anism above his eyes was the wide
six-part visi-screen which in space
would record the whole sphere
of the heavens while to his right

was the chief control board a
smooth black surface studed with
squads of vari-colored buttons and
lights these were the essentials
familiar to any ship navigator but
they were here awesome for they
controlled not the one or two hun-
dred feet of an ordinary craft but
twenty miles of this space-ship of
rock

  yes    yes    carse mur-
mured presently out of his study
then turned and for the first time
appeared to notice friday and ban
he gave orders

  eclipse you see the radio over
there get master leithgow on it
for me-protected beam ban you
bind dr ku sui in that chair
please

  wilson was surprised

  bind him isnt he going to run
this thing

  no

  youre going to carse

  yes i dont quite trust dr ku
the asteroids controlled on the
same principles as a space-ship
ill manage please hurry ean
capn suh already got the
master scientist called friday
from the radio panel the hawk
strode swiftly to it and clamped
the individual receivers over his
ears

  ms he asked into the micro-
phone youre there

 yes carse whats happened
alls well but im in a tremen-
dous hurry ive only got time
now to tell you were on the aster-
oid with dr ku prisoner and that
im undertaking to transplant the
coordinated brains into living hu-
man bodies    what yes trans-
plant them please ms-not now
questions later im calling pri-
marily to learn whether you have
any v- on hand

 eliot leithgow in his distant
laboratory paused before replying
when his voice sounded in the re-
ceivers again it was excited
the passing of ku sui



 i think i see carse good
yes i have a little-

  well need a lot the hawk cut
in tersely will you instruct your
assistants to begin preparing as
much as they can in the next hour
yes and your laboratory-clear it
for the operations and improvise
five operating tables powerful
lights too ms yes-yes-right-
all accessories have someone stand
by your radio ill radio further
details while were on our way
right carse all understood
the hawk remembered some-
thing else oh yes eliot-is
everything safe in your vicinity
theres a small band of isuanacs
foraging around somewhere in the
neighborhood but otherwise noth-
ing theyre harmless-

  but possibly observant fin-
ished carse all right-ill clear
them away before descending to
the lab until later eliot

carse switched off the micro-
phone and turned to catch
fridays shocked expression carse
looked inquiringly at his dark
satellite

  whats wrong

  lordy suh the negro whis-
pered dr ku could hear all you
said hell know where master
leithgpws laboratory is

 the hawk smiled briefly no
matter eclipse im quite sure the
information will avail him nothing
for this ride to the laboratory will
be his last ride but one he
turned were starting at once
ban youve bound him well

 if he can get out of those
knots grinned wilson ill kiss
him on the mouth

  the eurasians nostrils distend-
ed then he said i most cer-
tainly will not try but captain
carse may i have a cigarro before
we start on this journey

  carse had gone over to the space-
stick and his eyes were on the visi-

screen but he now turned them to
his old foe for a moment not
just now dr ku he said levelly
for it might be that all but two
puffs of it would be wasted yes-
later-if we survive these next few
minutes

  the remark did nothing to ease
the tension of their leaving ban
wilson could not restrain a ques-
tion

  carse are you going to risk at-
mospheric friction all the way to
the laboratory

  no havent time for that up
and down-up into space then
down to the lab-high acceleration
and deceleration

  he grasped the space-stick then
in neutral holding the asteroid
motionless in the valley he
glanced at the visi-screen again
checked over the main controls and
tightened his hand on the stick

  ready everyone he said and
gently moved the stick up and for-
ward

there was to the men in the
control room little conscious-
ness of power unleashed only the
visi-screen and the bank of posi-
tional instruments told what had
happened with that first delicate
movement of the space-stick it was
an experiment a feeler the indi-
cators of the positionals quivered a
little and altered and in the visi-
screen the hills of the valley that
a moment before had been quite
close and large had diminished to
purple-green mounds below

  then the accelerating sensations
began carse had the feel of the
asteroidal ship and his controlling
hand grew bolder the steady pres-
sure on the space-stick increased
it went up farther and farther and
the whole mighty mass of the as-
teroid streaked out at a tangent
through the atmosphere of satel-
lite iii toward the gulf beyond
with dangerous acceleration tho


astounding stories

gigantic body rose and from out-
side there grew a moaning which
was quickly a shrieking-a terrible
maddened sound as of a titan dy-
ing in agony-the sound of the
cloven atmosphere twenty miles
of rock were hurled out by the
firm hand on the space-stick and
that hand only increased its driv-
ing pressure when the screaming
o the air died away in the depth-
less silence of outer space

  in one special visi-screen lay
mirrored the craggy back-stretch of
the asteroid half of it clear-cut
and hard in jupiters flood of light
the other half lost in the encom-
passing blackness of space over
this shadowed portion a faint un-
earthly glow clung close the result
of the terrific friction of the ascent
in miniature in the regular screens
was satellite iii but a distorted
miniature for its half-face ap-
peared concave in shape and dust-
ed with the haze of its amosphere

the hawk was visibly relieved
he turned to the silent ku

sui

  i must congratulate you dr
ku he said on the operation of
the asteroid its as smooth as any
ship and now your cigarro ban
have you one

  wilson produced a small metal
case from which he extracted one
of the long black cylinders

  you will have to put it in my
lips please murmured dr ku
thank you and a light again
thanks ah he drew in the
smoke exhaled a fine stream of it
from his delicately carved nostrils
good then he looked up pleas-
antly at the hawk

  and my congratulations to you
captain not only on your expert
maneuvering of my asteroid but on
everything your resourcefulness
your decision your caution i have
long admired these qualities in you
and the events of to-day though

for me perhaps unfortunate in-
crease my admiration my own
weak resistance my attempt to
frustrate your plans in connection
with the brains-how miserable in
comparison it would seem cap-
tain that you cannot fail and that
you will indeed succeed in giving
the brains new life so swiftly do
you move yes my congratula-
tions 

  he drew at the cigarro and the
smoke wreathed gently around his
ascetic saffron face a faint queer
glint was visible under the long
lashes that half-veiled his eyes as
he continued

  but i have a question captain
a mere nothing but still-

  yes dr ku

  the living bodies into which
you propose to transplant the
brains-where are they

  hawk carses face was stern and
his voice frigid as he answered
fortunately those bodies are
right here on the asteroid

  here on the asteroid captain
i dont understand what bodies
are here

  the bodies of your four white
assistants whom i have safely con-
fined and one of your robot-coolies
also confined i did not intend to
use these five but because you put
a premium on time by your at-
tempted destruction of the brains
it cannot be helped

dr ku suis impassive de-
meanor did not change he
did not seem in the least surprised
he puffed quietly at the cigarro
and nodded

  of course of course you have
five bodies right here on the aster-
oid yes

  at least continued carse lev-
elly i do not regret having to
use the bodies of your men they
are no longer human they are not
men they are in effect but ma-
chines of your making dr ku
the passing of ku sui



  quite quite

  i suppose you find it an unpleas-
ant thought to have to be the
means of re-making them into
whole normal human beings

  on the contrary breathed the
eurasian you inspire a very pleas-
ant thought in my brain captain
carse-though i must confess it is
not exactly the thought you men-
tion a smile veiled by the smoke
of the cigarro appeared on his lips

  the hawk looked at him close-
ly the words had a hidden mean-
ing and it was clear he was not
intended to miss the implied threat
but what was ku suis thought
back in his mind an anxiety grew
indefinite vague and devilish

  and that vague anxiety was still
with him when fifty-seven minutes
later the asteroid returned from
its inverted u-flight slowed in its
hurtling drop from space and
hovered directly over the secret
hidden laboratory of master scien-
tist eliot leithgow

chapter viii

  whites brain-yellows head

to friday it was a bad mistake
to reveal the location of the
laboratory to dr ku sui from
him above all men had that loca-
tion up to now been kept just a
few days before hawk carse had
risked his life to preserve the se-
cret and yet now deliberately he
was showing it to the eurasian

  nervously friday watched him
and he saw that his eyes were alive
with interest as they scanned the
visi-screen it was too much for
the negro

  captain carse he whispered
coming close to the adventurer
look suh-hes seein it all
shouldnt i blindfold him

  carse shook his head but turned
to dr ku where he sat bound in
the chair scrutinizing the visi-
screen

  yes doctor he said there it
is-what you have searched for so
long-the refuge and the labora-
tory of eliot leithgow

  there captain murmured the
eurasian i see nothing

  and true the visi-screen showed
nothing but a hill a lake a swamp
and the distant surrounding jungle

  that spot on satellite iii had
been most carefully chosen by the
master scientist and carse as best
suiting their needs it lay at least
a thousand miles-a thousand miles
of ugly primeval jungle-from the
nearest unfriendly isuan ranch and
was diametrically opposite port o
porno thus it allowed leithgow
and carse to come and go with but
faint chance of being observed and
the steady watch kept through the
laboratorys telescopic instruments
lessened even that and even if
their movements to and from the
laboratory had been observed a spy
could have discovered little so in-
geniously was the camouflage con-
trived to use to best advantage the
natural features of the landscape

  at this spot on satellite iii
there was a small lake long rather
than wide at its shallow end the
lake lost itself in marshy thick-
grown swamps at its deep end it
washed against the slopes of a low
rounded hill topping the hill was
a rude ranch-house which to the
casual eye would appear the unim-
portant habitation of some poor
jungle-squatter with beds of vari-
ous vegetables and fruits growing
around it and guarded against the
jungles animals by what looked
like a makeshift fence the ground
inside the fence had been cleared
save for a few thick dead stumps
of ozi trees gnarled and weather-
beaten which made the whole out-
lay look crude and desolate

  so desolate so poor so humble
as not to deserve a second glance
from the lowest of scavenger or
pirate ships so misleading


astounding stories

carse had brought the invis-
ible asteroid to a halt perhaps
a half mile above the hill the
minutes were slipping by bringing
the two-hour deadline ever closer
but he did not skimp his customary
caution on approaching the labora-
tory from the control room he
swept the electelscope over the sur-
rounding terrain and soon sighted
the band of isuanacs eliot leith-
gow had mentioned

  through the scopes magnifying
mirrors they seemed but yards
away though they were wander-
ing knee-deep in the marshes at
the far end of the lake all their
repulsive details stood out clearly

  more beasts than men were such
isuanacs pronounced ee-swan-acs
so called from the drug that had
betrayed them step by step to a pit
in which there was no intelligence
no light no hope-nothing but
their mind-shattering craving in
many and unpredictable ways did
the drug ravish their bodies they
were outcasts from the port of
outcasts driven out of porno into
the wilderness where they tracked
out their miry ways searching ever
for the isuan weed until some ani-
mal ended their enslavement or
the drug itself finally killed them
in convulsions they were the le-
gion of the damned

  this band of half a dozen was
typical grubbing through the slime
of the swamp snarlin at each
other now and again fighting over
a leaf then squatting down in the
mud where they were to chew on
it their torture of mind and body
momentarily forgotten rags mud-
caked and foul partly covered their
emaciated bodies their hair was
matted their eyes blood-shot

  carse noted their position and
looked up at friday

  get the master scientist for
me please he requested the radio
connection took only seconds and
then he said into the microphone

  eliot were directly above you
as you probably have seen all
well

  yes carse the laboratorys in
readiness but those isuanacs-
theyre still outside

  ive seen them and im going
to drive them away then ill be
down to you have the upper en-
trance ready

the hawk turned back to the
controls taking the space-
stick out of neutral he moved it
very slightly down and to one side
ban and friday not understanding
his intention watched the visi-
screen

  the whole mass of rock that was
the asteroid changed position at a
gentle speed the band of isuanacs
came nearer and nearer and then
were to the right completely
oblivious of the great bulk hover-
ing above them they continued
their grubbing through the swamp
and then the asteroid was over the
jungle beyond them and lowering
its craggy under-side

 the under-side brushed the
crown of the jungle the trees
bent crackled and broke as if
swept by a vicious but silent hur-
ricane only a moment of contact
but in that moment a square mile
of interwoven trees and vines was
swept low-and to the isuanacs the
effect as was intended was terri-
fying

  they stared at the phenomenon
there had been no sound no whip
of wind nothing-yet all those
trees had bent and crashed splinter-
ing to the ground their slaver-
ing lips open the isuan weed for-
gotten they stared and then
howling and shrieking they broke
and went splashing off panic-
stricken through the marsh

  in five minutes the band had dis-
appeared into the jungle in the op-
posite direction and the district
was cleared and by that time hawk
the passing of ku sui



carse was again in his space-suit
out of the control room and busy
at the mechanism of one of the
great ship-sized port-locks in the
dome having left behind him both
ban and friday to guard dr ku

  he mastered the controls of the
port-lock quickly and swung inner
and outer doors open he glided
through and then a giant clumsy
figure poised far out in the air a
soft breeze washing his face as he
gazed down at the hill five miles
below judging his descent as he
did not use the infra-red instru-
ment hanging from his neck the
asteroid might not have been there
at all

 a moment or so later after a
straight swift drop carse landed
on the hill close to a particular
gnarled ozi-tree stump the nearby
ranch-house looked deserted the
whole place seemed desolate the
hawk waddled over to the stump
pressed a crooked little twig stick-
ing out from it and a section of
the seeming-bark slid down re-
vealing the hollow metal-sided in-
terior of a cleverly camouflaged
shaft

 there were rungs inside but
carse could not use them he
squeezed himself in closed the en-
trance panel and carefully manip-
ulating his gravity controls floated
down a descent of twenty-five feet
and he was on the floor of a short
level corridor with gray walls and
ceiling

  carse clumped along to the door
at the other end of the corridor
opened it and stepped into the
hidden underground laboratory of
master scientist eliot leithgow
which with its storerooms living
quarters and space-ship hangar had
been built into the hollowed-out
hill

tielcome back carse

 vv hello eliot the hawk
nodded rapidly divesting himself

of the suit but retaining his infra-
red device youve lost no time
i see

  the elderly scientist his frail
form clad in a buff-colored smock
turned and surveyed the laboratory
in the center of the square room
five improvised operating tables
were drawn up each one flooded
individually with light from fo-
cused flood-tubes above in the
white ceiling flanking them were
tables for instruments and ster-
ilizers and more prominent two
small sleek cylindrical drums from
one of which sprouted a tube end-
ing in a breathing-cone

the best i could do on such
short notice leithgow commented
where are your assistants

  at work on the v- all i had
on hand is in those cylinders
much

  enough for twelve hours for one
man but the process of its manu-
facture is accelerating fortunately
i had plenty of ingredients of
course ive divined your intention
carse ku sui to perform the op-
erations under the v- and its
possible possible its stupendous
-and possible

  yes said the hawk but more
later im going up now to get dr
ku ill use the air-car its ready
yes leithgow answered but
carse-one question i must ask-
the hawk already halfway to
the door in the opposite wall of
the laboratory paused and looked
back inquiringly

  what bodies are to be used
the only ones available eliot
the adventurer replied since ku
sui in his attempt to destroy the
brains left us only two hours-now
one hour-to complete the first
steps of the transfer theyll be
those four white assistants of his
-those men you remember whose
intellects hes dehumanized-

 yes yes leithgow pressed
him eagerly and the fifth


astounding stories

  a robot coolie

 good god

  i know eliot it wont be pleas-
ant for one of those brains to find
itself in a yellow body but its
that or nothing

  the scientist nodded slowly his
first expression of shock leaving
his old face to sadness but a
coolie a coolie

 come eliot we need speed
speed weve but an hour remem-
ber to complete the first steps ill
have ku sui and the five men down
immediately

 the hawk opened the door and
strode down the long corridor be-
yond his footsteps were swiftly
gone and then the sound of an-
other door opening and closing in
the laboratory there was a murmur
from the old man

  a coolie a scientists brain in
that ugly yellow head when con-
sciousness returns what a cruel
shock

chapter ix
four bodies

hawk carse had gone into
leithgows ship hangar

  it was a vast place occupying
most of the hollowed-out space of
the hill seventy feet high and
more than two hundred feet long
it was and like the rest of the
rooms metal-walled and sound-
proofed eliot leithgows own per-
sonal space-ship the sandra rest-
ed there on its mooring cradle
and by its side was the laboratorys
air-car an identical shape in minia-
ture designed for atmospheric
transit

  the adventurer a silent swift
figure went straight to the air-car
and climbed into its control seat
he tested the controls found them
responsive then pressed a button
set apart from the others and the
huge port-lock door set in the
farther wall of the hangar slid

smoothly open revealing a metal
chamber similar to that of the ship
port-lock on ku suis asteroid but
whereas the chamber of the aster-
oids port-lock was for vacuum-
atmosphere this was for water-
atmosphere

 the clamps of the mooring cra-
dle were released and the air-car
moved gently into the lock cham-
ber the door swung shut behind
on the pressing of another button
there sounded a gurgling and
splashing of water and quickly
the chamber was filled the air-car
was now a submarine all these
operations were effected by radio
control from within it

  when the water filled the inside
of the chamber the second door
opened automatically and the car
started forward through a long
steel-lined water-filled tube it con-
tinued on even keel until carse
watching through the bow window
saw a red light flash in the ceiling
of the tube and then he tilted the
car and rose

  a second later the shiny water-
dripping shape of the car broke
through the surface of the lake that
edged on the hill and forsook the
water for the air

  to an outside observer the ap-
pearance of the air-car and its sub-
sequent movements would have
been incomprehensible there lay
the hill desolate barren apparent-
ly lifeless and there washing
against its slopes the lake noth-
ing more then suddenly a curve
of gleaming steel thrust up through
the muddy water rose swiftly al-
most straight into the cloudless
blue of the sky and as suddenly
disappeared and remained gone
from sight as if the ether had
opened and swallowed it

using his infra-red device
carse brought the car in neat-
ly through the ship-size port-lock
of the dome and sped it across to
the passing of ku sui



the central building to land light-
ly beside one of the wings de-
barking he ran down the wings
passage and in a few seconds was
back in the asteroids control room

 friday was sitting in a chair
close by the bound eurasian ban
wilson more restless was pacing
up and down the hawk nodded
in response to their looks of wel-
come and issued curt orders

  all ready ban the air-cars just
outside go over and get those four
men and the coolie and put them
in it have your raygun ready but
dont use it if humanly possible
were going down to the labora-
tory i want speed please hurry
right carse

 friday the hawk continued
help me untie dr ku

 they stooped to the chair and
the impassive silken figure sitting
in it and in a moment the bonds
were ripped off all save those on
the wrists stretching himself the
eurasian asked

  you are taking the brains down
now captain carse

 no-just you your assistants
and that one coolie this trip mas-
ter leithgow and i wish to have a
talk with you

 i am always agreeable my
friend

  yes said the hawk youll be
surprisingly agreeable and truth-
ful and helpful too now-outside
please and do not attempt to delay
me in any way i am in a great
hurry and consequently will not be
patient at any tricks he turned to
the negro friday im leaving
you here on guard stay alert gun
handy and keep in radio contact
ill be back soon

  yes suh

alking behind his cap-
tive the hawk left passing
down the wing to the air-car out-
side there ban wilson was wait-
ing with the four white assistants

of dr ku and the one robot-coolie
all unarmed stolid emotionless
carse placed them all in the rear
seats of the cars compartment ban
facing them with drawn raygun
then with a hum from its genera-
tors the car raised wheeled slid
forward until through the large
port-lock and swooped down to the
lake

  dr ku sui watched everything
with an interest he did not attempt
to disguise there was being re-
vealed to him the secret entrance to
eliot leithgows laboratory and
long had he sought for that labora-
tory long pondered on its probable
location no doubt at various times
passing over he had seen the bar-
ren hill and its flanking lake but
had never given them a second
glance yet here right in the lake
was the doorway to leithgows
refuge

  the air-car lowered like a hum-
ming bird to the lakes surface
paused and dipped under the light
left the sealed ports and entrance
hatchway and the water pressed
around dark and muddy down the
car sunk apparently without direc-
tion its course very slow until
ahead out of the blackness a spot
of red winked

  at once the air-car made towards
it and slid into the tube leading
through the hill quickly it was in
the chamber of the lock the outer
door closed automatically behind
the water was drained out and
then the inner door opened and the
car dripping emerged into the
brilliantly-lit hangar and went to
rest in its mooring cradle beside
leithgows space-ship

  a minute later its passengers
were in the laboratory of the mas-
ter scientist

dr ku sui took in the ar-
rangements made in the lab-
oratory with a swift glance and
then his eyes went to a door that


astounding stories

opened in the opposite wall and to
the slight smock-garbed figure that
came through it he smiled

  ah master leithgow a return
visit you see at captain carses
invitation it is very interesting to
me this home of yours so cleverly
concealed

  leithgow vouchsafed his arch-
enemy no more than a look but
turned to the hawk

   you are ready carse

   some preliminaries first eliot
these men the four whites and the
yellow must be put in some place
of safety you can take care of
them ban one of the storerooms
lock them in you remember your
way then better take off your
suit

  ban nodded and led the five
robot-humans out leithgow hawk
carse and ku sui were left alone
in the laboratory and for a minute
there was silence

  how much had passed between
these three how many plots and
counter-plots how much blood
how many lives affected the feud
of hawk cars- and dr ku sui-
and eliot leithgow who was the
chief cause of it-here again had
come to a head here again were
all the varied forces of brains and
guile science and skill marshaled
in the great vital game on whose
outcome depended the restoration
of eliot leithgow and the lives of
the coordinated brains and indeed
though more distantly the fate of
all the tribes of men on all the
planets for if ku sui won free
he would go on irresistibly and
his goal was the domination of the
solar system 

  three men alone in a room-and
the course of the creature man be-
ing affected by their every move
large words but the histories of
the period bear them out though
doubtless ku sui alone knew how
great were the stakes as they stood
there in the laboratory

hawk carse was uneasy
the odds seemed all on his
side-yet there was ku suis
strange almost imperceptible smile
his mysterious words up on the
asteroid his smooth unruffled as-
surance what did these things
mean he intended now to find
out he said tersely

  eliot i have informed dr ku
that he is to be the means of the
transplantion of the coordinated
brains to living human bodies since
he is the only person capable of
performing the operations he does
not believe that we can force him
to do our will yet all the same he
is taking no chances he started
the death of the brains we shall
have to work very fast-all right
but dr ku has other cards to play
against us and i dont know what
they are you and i must find out
now

  i somehow feel that you mis-
trust me interposed the eurasian
with mock sadness ah if you

could only read my mind---- or

can you is that what you are
coming to

  the hawk glanced at leithgow
and leithgow nodded and placed
a metal chair close to one of the
cylindrical drums--the one fitted
with a tube and breathing cone

  will you sit there dr ku
carse asked

  the green eyes scanned the
drum

  a gas master leithgow

  that is all not harmful not
painful

  i see i see the eurasian
murmured and suddenly he smiled
at the two men facing him and
said pleasantly to carse

  things repeat not long ago i
asked you to sit in a chair and
submit to a treatment of mine and
you did as i asked after so gallant
a precedent how could i refuse
all right now master leithgow
your gas
the passing of ku sui



ith gentle fingers eliot
leithgow fitted the cone on
the eurasians face and fastened it
there the fingers and thumb of
one hand he kept on dr kus
pulse with the other he pulled
over slowly a control set in the
side of the drum a ticking and
slight hissing became audible and
two indicators on the drum quiv-
ered and crept downward

 a minute of this-the ticking
and soft hissing the indicators
slow fall the silk-clad figure in
the chair watched closely by carse
on one side and eliot leithgow on
the other-and a change was appar-
ent a ripple flowed over the eura-
sians silken garments the body
appeared to loosen up to become
free of all muscular and mental
tension the gas hissed on

  the first step murmured leith-
gow abstractedly out of his con-
entration on dials and patient
the muscles-notice-relaxed the
will-the ego-the nexi of emo-
tions and volitions which oppose
external direction-all being worked
upon submerged neutralized-but
not his knowledge not his skill
no-all that he will retain youll
notice nothing more until you see
his eyes a few minutes what says
the red hand thirteen at nine-
teen it should be completed

  carse watched intently it was
wonderful to know that when the
correct amount of this substance
which he knew only as v- had
been administered and ku sui
awoke there would be no enmity
in him no opposition to their de-
mands no fencing with wits that
this same ku sui his great men-
tality unimpaired would be sub-
servient and entirely dependable

  seventeen murmured the old
scientist eighteen    now
with a flick of his fingers he shut
off the stream of v- and gently
unloosened the cone from dr kus
face

  the ascetic features were in re-
pose the eyelids closed their long
black lashes lying against the deli-
cate saffron of the skin dr ku
sui seemed resting in dreamless
unclouded sleep but for only a
moment soon the eyelids quivered
and slowly opened-and a great
change was immediately visible in
the mans green eyes

 many observers have recorded
that under the veiled enigmatic
eyes of dr ku sui there lurked
a sultry glimmer of fire or perhaps
it was that the observers who met
these eyes always imagined the
fire being conscious of the devil
and the tiger in the man but carse
and leithgow now saw that all that
was gone

  no mask lay over the green eyes
now no spark of fire glinted deep
in them they were clear and
serene they hid nothing almost
they were the eyes of a fresh inno-
cent child dr ku sui he of a
hundred schemes a score of plots
he of the magnificent capacity and
untiring brain bearing ever toward
his goal of lordship of the solar
system-it was as if he had slipped
into a magic pool whose waters had
washed him clean and given him
innocence and eyes of peace

the eurasian breathed deeply
then smiled at the two men
standing by him

  now whispered eliot leith-
gow ask him anything he will
answer truthfully

 the hawk lost no time he
asked

  dr ku you will perform the
brain transplantations for us
yes my friend

  the mans tone was different
gone was the suaveness the cus-
tomary polite mockery it was
frank open genuinely pleasant

  is it true dr ku that your
coordinated brains will die if left
in their case


astounding stories

yes they will die if left there
within what time to save them
must the operations to transplant
them into human bodies be
started

  within twenty-five perhaps
thirty minutes at the most

  can all five brains be given the
initial steps for transplantation
into the heads of your four white
assistants and the coolie prisoner
within one hour-the remaining
half of the two hours the brains
said they would retain the neces-
sary vitality

  dr ku smiled at him there was
no malice in the thunderbolt that
he unleashed then he simply told
what he knew to be the truth

  by fast work they could be
and so saved although the subse-
quent operations will take weeks
but the brains cannot be trans-
planted into the heads of my four
white assistants

 what both the hawk and
leithgow cried the word out to-
gether they cannot

dr ku looked at them as
though astonished

  why no my friends i wish i
were able to but i cannot perform
the operations by myself unaided
that would be impossible absurd
   you seem startled surely you
must have known that those as-
sistants would be vital to the work
i have taught them you see
trained them they were specialists
in brain surgery to begin with and
i do not believe there are any
others this side of mars who could
take their place in operations of
this type without them i could
never transplant the brains

  this then had been the trick up
his sleeve this was why in the
control room of the asteroid he
had shown relief when the hawk
told him what bodies were to be
used for the transplantation for
he had known that whatever eliot

leithgows method of forcing him
to perform the operations might be
and no matter how efficacious the
coordinated brains simply could not
be put in the heads of his four as-
sistants-because the assistants were
themselves needed for the opera-
tions

  then-its hopeless said the
master scientist bitterly all this
for nothing you might find other
bodies in port o porno carse-con-
demned men criminals-but pornos
an hour away two hours round trip
and in thirty minutes the wains will

be too weak to save----

  i am sorry ku sui continued
i should have told you before per-
haps if there were any way out i
knew of i would tell you but there
does not seem to be-

  yes broke in hawk carse sud-
denly his left hand had been pull-
ing at his bangs of flaxen hair his
brain had been working very fast
he added coldly

  yes there is a way

leithgow and ku sui looked

at him inquiringly

  we need four bodies he went
on we have one-the coolie he
is not needed to assist in the opera-
tions four bodies-and here ready
in twenty-five minutes not the
bodies of normal men of those with
life ahead of them no that would
be murder four bodies of con-
demned men-men with no hope
left nothing left to live for i can
get them

  he brushed aside ku suis and
leithgows questions he was all
steel now frigid intent hard
ban he called ban wilson
yes carse ban had been wait-
ing outside the laboratory

  put on your propulsive space-
suit hurry then here

  right

  carse ran over to where he had
left his suit and rapidly got inside
as he did so he said
the passing of ku sui



  eliot theres fast work to be
done while im gone with ban
you must take your assistants and
dr ku up to the asteroid in the
air-car and transfer down here all
the equipment dr ku says hell
need be extremely careful with
the case of coordinated brains if
you possibly can have everything
in readiness by the time ban and
i return with the four bodies
ban wilson in his suit entered
the laboratory the hawk gestured
him to the door which led to the
tree-shaft to the surface

  but carse what bodies where
can you get four more living hu-
man bodies leithgow cried

  no time now eliot the hawk
rapped out turning at the door
just do as i say-and hurry ill
get them

  and he was gone

chapter x
the promise fulfilled

although puzzled by the

hawks promise leithgow
could only put his trust in it and
go ahead with the preparations as
he had been directed he took two
of his three laboratory assistants
off their hurried manufacture of
quantities of the v- and with
ku sui went out into the air-car
passing by way of tube and lake
and air they were quickly inside
the dome on the asteroid and then
into ku suifc laboratory where
friday waited on guard

  completely docile and friendly
the eurasian indicated the various
instruments and devices he would
need for the operations and these
were transported quickly then
came the case of coordinated brains
dr ku detached its connections
with expert fingers and all but
leithgow took a corner and carried
it with infinite care to the air-car
outside

  do i stay here suh friday

asked the master scientist in a
whisper though informed of the
change in dr ku effected by the
v- he was still very suspicious
of him seems to me hes a bit too
meek and mild suh i think i ought
to go down and watch him

 eliot leithgow did not quite
know what answer to give the
eurasian forced the decision

  i will need he observed in his
new frank voice all the assistance
you can possibly give me i am
faced by a tremendous task and
the use of every man will be neces-
sary i would suggest master
leithgow that the negro be
brought down

  and so friday came and the as-
teroid was left unguarded a mis-
take this turned out to be but
under the circumstances eliot
leithgow could hardly be blamed
for it there was so much on their
minds so much work of vital im-
portance so desperate a need for
speed that quite naturally other
considerations were subordinated
the asteroid to the naked eye
was invisible it could attract no
attention its occupants had all
been disposed of certainly it
seemed safe enough to leave it un-
guarded for a while

 however eliot leithgow took
one precaution down in his own
laboratory again in the midst of
the work of transferring dr kus
operating equipment from the air-
car he called aside one of his as-
sistants and instructed him to go
and survey the asteroid through the
infra-red device every ten minutes
and with this order the old scien-
tist dismissed the matter from his
mind and turned all his energies
to preparing the laboratory for the
operations

under ku suis directions
his cases of equipment were
brought in and arrayed and the
various drills and delicate saws and


astounding stories

such other instruments as worked
by electricity were connected
everything was sterilized rapidly
the plain square room assumed the
appearance of an operating arena
the five tables in the center spot-
lessly white and clean under the
direct beams of the tubes hanging
from the ceiling at the head of
every table a stand on which were
containers of antiseptics bottles of
etheloid a breathing cone rolls of
gauze and other materials and
along the edge of the stand- identi-
cal complete sets of fine instru-
ments

  the case of coordinated brains
was brought into the laboratory
last the inner liquid was now dark
and apparently lifeless to the
casual eye it would not have
seemed possible that the five gray-
ish mounds immersed in the liquid
held life and indeed leithgow
looked at them doubtfully

  are you sure theyre still alive
do you think theres still time
he asked dr ku

  the eurasian picked up a long
slender tubelike instrument with
a dial topping it then going to
the brain-case he touched a clever-
ly concealed catch and a square
pane set in the top of the case
swung back he dipped the instru-
ment he held into the liquid and
for a moment stood silent watching
the dial then he took it out re-
closed the pane and turned to
leithgow

  a test he explained the in-
dicator interpreted means we have
about forty-eight minutes in which
to complete the first phase of the
transplantation of the brains into
human heads it might be done if
we start in eight minutes but the
human heads- he paused

  eight minutes said leithgow
worriedly eight minutes for
carse to come he promised the
bodies but    well we can only
go ahead with the preparations and

trust to him is everything ready
all but my assistants i had bet-
ter see them now

the master scientist issued an
order to one of his men and
presently the four white assistants
of dr ku were led into the labora-
tory for these men no v- was
needed their brains were utterly
subservient to dr ku sui and his
orders they would obey unques-
tioningly no matter what the work
there was no danger from them

  they stood motionless their eyes
fastened on their master as he
spoke to them

  brain operations he said
these-he indicated the case-
are to be transplanted again into
human heads you have done work
similar to it before you know the
routine but now it must be quick
synchronize your speed with mine
i will be working very rapidly
and it is vital that you be in har-
mony with me every instant when
the bodies come you will prepare
the heads and then you will attend
me through every step you under-
stand he turned to the old scien-
tist operating gowns gloves
masks master leithgow

  i have your own over there
your black costume is among
them

  but leithgows answer was ab-
stracted four minutes for carse to
come or else everything lost he
busied himself helping the four
surgeons and two of his own as-
sistants into the white sterilized
gowns and the masks that left only
the eyes free and the skin-tight
rubber gloves but his mind was
not with his actions the old man
looked very frail now his age
showed in the deep lines now emi-
nent on his face three minutes-
swiftly two

  at least observed ku sui we
have one body the coolie i had
better start immediately on him
the passing of ku sui



  bring him out leithgow in-
structed one of his men one
brain will be saved but-there
thank god hear that coming
down the passage its carse re-
turning 

t was carse he and ban wil-
son coming down the passage
from the top of the tree-shaft
everyone in  the laboratory could
hear plainly the heavy sliding
tread of the great space-boots eliot
leithgow was first to the door
he opened it peered through
eagerly and called

  carse youve got them

  yes eliot here-we need help
the hawks voice sounded weary
friday and the scientist ran down
the passageway until they reached
the adventurer in the faint light
they saw he was carrying a limp
body he laid it carefully down on
the floor

 bans coming down with an-
other he said and there are two
more above go up and get them
friday

  the negro started to obey but
eliot leithgow did not move did
not utter a sound he stood staring
at the body carse had laid down
the parchmentlike skin of his face
seemed to whiten that was all but
he winced and slowly brushed his
eyes with his hands when in a
moment ban wilson floated down
the shaft and approached with a
second unconscious body

  at last leithgow whispered
theyre all-like that carse
yes answered the emotionless
voice there were two others but
we let them go they were worse
the gray eyes looked steadily at
eliot leithgow i know the
hawk said its horrible-but it
cant be helped it was these or
nothing there was no choice
hawk carse had fulfilled his
promise he had brought back four
isuanacs

chapter xi
ordeal

five bodies lay on the operat-
ing tables in eliot leithgows
laboratory the air hushed and
heavy was pervaded by the various
odors of antiseptics and etheloid
the breathing cones had been ap-
plied to each of the bodies and
they were now locked fast in con-
trolled unconsciousness

  on the first table lay the body
of the robot-coolie a man of me-
dium size sturdy well-muscled
with the smooth round yellow face
and stub nose of his kind his
short-cropped bristly black hair
had been shaved off the head was
now bald that head was destined
to hold the mighty brain of master
scientist raymond cram

  on the second table lay a twist-
ed distorted thing an apelike body
with which fate had played gro-
tesque pranks it was hairy of
middle height and its dark skin all
over was wizened and coarse al-
most like the bark of a tree the
legs were short and bowed the
hands stubby claws the face puck-
ered even in unconsciousness was
that of a gargoyle in pain the
long matted hair had been shaved
away the large pate washed with
antiseptics soon were the opera-
tion successful that head would
hold the brain of professor edgar
estapp world-famous chemist and
bio-chemist

  on the third table lay a shape
skeletonlike in appearance so ema-
ciated was it so closely did the
bones press into the dry fever-
yellowed skin of one leg only the
stump was left this creature had
been forced to hop or crawl his
way through the isuan swamps
the head too was no more than
a skull with great sunken dark-
rimmed eyes discolored fangs and
loose leathery lips there had been
no hair on this deaths-head it had


astounding stories

long been bald and now washed
clean for the first time in months
or even years it was to hold the
brain of dr ralph swanson
earths one-time leader in the
science of psychology

  on the fourth table lay a giants
body-but a hollow giant a giant
made thin and pitiful by the rav-
ages of his destroyer isuan a
roistering free-booting space-ship
sailor this man may once have
been but from the drug the
mighty arms had been twisted and
shrivelled the strong legs wasted
away one ear had been torn from
the skull in an old brawl and what
was left was naked and ugly to the
eye behind that bitter drug-coars-
ened face would be the new home
of the brain of sir charles esme
norman wizard of mathematics
and once a polished charming
englishman

  on the fifth table lay a dwarf
its ridiculous body was not over
four and a half feet long though
the head was larger than that of
a normal man in the old dark ages
on earth this body would have
served for the jester of a lord the
comic butt of a king in more re-
cent times as the prize of a circus
side-show the huge weighty head
with its ugly brooding mask of a
face the childs body below-this
was for the brain of professor
erich geinst the solitary german
who had stood preeminent on earth
in astronomy

these creatures were the re-
sult of hawk carses desperate
search they had composed with
one other the band of isuanacs
that had been rooting in the swamp
at the end of the lake when the
asteroid had first arrived the
hawk had remembered them and
had quickly seen that they were
the only answer to the problem
and so with ban wilson he had
gone out for them his mind steeled

to the ghastly thought of the great
scientists brains in such bodies
in space-suits they had swept down
on them there had been no time
for considerate measures the four
isuanacs had been abruptly knocked
out by the impact of the great suits
swooping against them and carried
back to the laboratory

  eliot leithgow had been shocked
at the idea of a scientists brain
in the head of the robot-coolie
how much greater then was his
horror when confronted by the need
of using these appalling remnants
of men but he could not protest
what else was there ku sui un-
der the v- had spoken the truth
the operations would be impossible
without the aid of his four as-
sistants the brains even now were
dying the choice was bodies of
isuanacs or death for the brains
the scientist and the adventurer
had chosen

  circumstances had required their
use ku suis attempt to kill the
brains thus inflicting a time limit
the presence of the band of isuan-
acs near the laboratory each cir-
cumstance with a long train of
other minor ones behind it chance
or fate-whatever it is-whether
predetermined or accidental-men
must wonder at its working and
know awe from its patterns and re-
sults seldom certainly was there
a pattern more strange than this
now being worked out in the lab-
oratory of master scientist eliot
leithgow

  the bodies lay there washed
shaved and swathed in customary
loose operating garments globules
of etheloid dropped steadily down
into the breathing cones of hunch-
back living skeleton twisted giant
dwarf and robot-coolie one by one
the isuanacs dropped with the fall-
ing of the etheloid into uncon-
sciousness-and that was their fare-
well to the brains each one de-
bauched either by isuan-drug or
the passing of ku sui



skill of genius that they had
known

 and movement began in the
laboratory white-clothed figures
masked and capped used gleaming
instruments in their gloved hands
and all the figures were mute-
mute from their great concentration
on the delicate work in progress-
or mute from horror that would not
die

o	began the ordeal

  of its details hawk carse
knew little they were not of his
world only for the first half-hour
could he follow intelligently what
was being done he too had put
on a white robe as had ban wilson
and friday and he stood at one
side of the room a silent intently
watching figure with the two other
men of action ban and the negro
while the rest moved in a kind of
rhythm the center-piece was the
black-garbed ku sui moving from
this table to that slim gloved hands
flying pausing flying again steady-
ing concentrating on a detail once
more sweeping forward no more
than single words came from him
he and his assistants worked almost
as a whole in perfect sympathy
and coordination and a constant
stream of instruments flowed to
him and then away their task done

  the first table and then to the
second with one white figure stay-
ing behind at the first finishing off
details of the work left by the
master the third table the fourth
the fifth and then back to the first
while two white figures detached
themselves from the main group
and went to the nearby case of co-
ordinated brains an object held in
a specially formed type of pan was
lifted out and carried to the first
table and carse sensed a crisis in
the attitudes of the working men
this he knew was the first great
step a brain was being re-born
the fingers of men and one man in

particular were fashioning a mir-
acle

  how could he hope to under-
stand he could only hang on the
movements of that group of figures
and feel relief as he saw them set-
tle into smoothness again evident-
ly the first crisis was past a few
minutes more were spent at the first
table then once more dr ku sui
went to the second and another
object was carried from the coldly
gleaming case

  and in a long deep pan standing
on short legs beside the case some-
thing gray and shapeless and warm
was placed

  the first phase came to an end
when there were five similar things
in the open pan and nothing ex-
cept the liquid and a multitude of
spidery disconnected wires in the
case that but shortly before had
harbored the brains of five scien-
tists 

a pause relaxation tests
the black-clad figure spoke to
one in yellow in a tone of pleased
relief

  successful so far master leith-
gow we may congratulate our-
selves on the consummation of the
first step it has been done i be-
lieve well within the time limit
yes dr ku yes and now-
how long will be needed to fin-
ish

  that is up to you normally i
would require a month in that
time all could be done safely with
small chance-

  too long said leithgow

  carse intervened

  why too long eliot

  the old scientist went over close
to him and in a lowered voice
explained

  ku sui would develop immunity
to the v- in a month two weeks
of it would give him part immu-
nity even ten days might he has
to be re-gassed four times a day


astounding stories

  but letting him come out of
it every night and resting nor-
mally the hawk objected

  i have allowed for that the
gas would still be in his system
no-nine or ten days is the limit
he raised his voice again to reach
the eurasian can you complete
the work within nine days dr
ku

  ku sui considered it at last he
said

  that is a lot to ask master
leithgow but-it might be possi-
ble however it would mean prodi-
gies of sustained concentrated
labor work and skill never-ceasing
well have to work in shifts nat-
urally

  so it was arranged all the as-
sistants both ku suis and leith-
gows were portioned off into
shifts of four hours sleep and
eight hours work carse ban wil-
son and friday too for now every
one of them was needed

  nine days for the work of a
month-and work as delicate and
vital as could possibly be small
wonder that in the minds of all of
them the hawk and the old scien-
tist and ban and the negro that
period when remembered later
seemed no more than a confused
unreal hazy dream rather a night-
mare connected imperishably with
the odors of an operating room
antiseptics etheloid and the glint
of small sharp instruments

  it was a titanic task an ordeal
that stretched to the limit the
powers of the men working in that
confined space normal life for
them ceased the operating room
became a new universe swiftly
they lost consciousness of time
even with the routine of the chang-
ing shifts and the food which was
brought in at regular hours anti-
septics etheloid the never-ceasing
flow of the instruments the five
bodies lying still and deathlike on
the tables the hard white glare of

the light beating down on them-
all this and nothing more-all
sealed away underground from the
life of the forgotten world above
on and on and on

it is impossible even to conjec-
ture how the mind of ku sui
saw the colossal work that he was
doing to aid his most bitter ene-
mies even when he was normal
there are only moments when
through some recorded speech or
action of his we can peer past the
mans personality into his brain
how great a sealed mystery must
his thoughts remain to us when
held in that abnormal state by eliot
leithgows v- envision it this
arch-foe of hawk carse and leith-
gow helping their designs lending
all his intellect his great skill to
their purposes aiding them in
everything certainly afterwards
the memory of what he had been
forced to do must have occasioned
dr ku many bitter moments regu-
larly every four waking hours he
was led to the metal chair and
gassed afresh with the v- and
his expression remained pleasant
his eyes were always friendly but
the artificial state in which he was
kept showed soon on his face it
lost its clearness and became a
jaundiced yellow in color and also
it grew peaked and drawn

  but the other faces around him
were peaked and drawn too the
terrific strain told in definite terms
on all no matter what stimulants
they took to keep going many a
man would have been driven to in-
sanity by their sustained terrible
concentration and the knowledge
that five lives hung on every action
however minute

  on and on and on science made
into a marathon four hours of ex-
hausted deathlike sleep eight
hours more of the smells and the
glaring light and the moving in-
struments days of this sealing the
the passing of ku sui



brains permanently into their new
homes into their hideous new
bodies   

  but finally came the climax and
the last exhausted spurt of work
for the concluding twelve hours
there was no sleep or rest for any-
one and at the end a breathless
haggard tension held them as dr
ku sui a shell of his former self
reviewed the results of the nine
days ordeal his verdict was
four have come through i
think safe the fifth-i do not
know his body was near death
when he was brought here he may
live or die it is impossible to tell
now but it is finished

  then the men slept some slipped
to the floor and slept where they
were in nine days the work of a
month had been done and a miracle
wrought the brains had been born
again

chapter xii
flight

it was to hawk carse that the
news of imminent danger came
first

  he had staggered from the lab-
oratory into a sleeping room and
clad as he was fallen over into a
berth he would have wakened in a
few hours such was his custom of
years to four-hour watches on
ships but he was permitted less
than an hour of sleep a hand
pulled at him a voice kept calling
his name awareness returned to
him slowly as his brain roused
from the coma of sleep

  captain carse captain carse
wake up sir

 it was one of leithgows as-
sistants a man named thorpe his
tone was excited and his manner
distraught

  yes the hawk muttered thick-
ly what is it

its the asteroid sir i was in-
structed to watch it at intervals

but i-i guess i fell asleep and
just now-

  carse sat up yes what

  -when i looked through the
glasses-it was gone

  gone youre sure let me see
swiftly thorpe at his heels
carse strode out from the room to
a cubby just off the laboratory the
watch-post where observational
electelscopes and visi-screens pro-
vided a panorama of the surround-
ing territory

  he gazed through the electel-
scope which had been equipped
with an infra-red device and trained
on the asteroid and saw that now
where the massive body of rock had
been poised there was nothing
only the brilliant light of mid-
afternoon the cloudless sky carse
swept the glass around the search
was fruitless the heavens were
bare the asteroid had gone

  in half a minute carse had rea-
soned out the disappearance saw
the consequences and made the in-
evitable decision gone was the tor-
por of sleep the weariness of the
laboratory this was a crisis and
this was his work during the
operations he had been able merely
to obey orders and do manual work
now he assumed command

  your lapse has imperilled us
all he said curtly to thorpe
from now on were in great dan-
ger stay here and keep on watch
and sound the alarm immediately
if the asteroid reappears

  yes sir i-im sorry-

  the adventurer cut him off with
a frigid nod and ran on silent
rapid feet to the laboratory where
both ban wilson and friday lay
fast asleep roughly carse shook
them into consciousness trained to
shipboard routine and the sudden
emergencies of space they needed
but little time to return to full
wakefulness in staccato sentences
the new situation was outlined to
them


astounding stories

  the asteroids gone that means
danger to everything here we will
have to evacuate ban wake all the
men including ku sui and his as-
sistants then come to me for fur-
ther orders friday see that leith-
gows ship is ready for instant de-
parture quick

 alarmed but without questions
the two parted on their separate
errands carse went to the room
where eliot leithgow lay asleep

the pallor and weariness of the
old scientists face were empha-
sized by the alarming news his
friend brought him but he took it
with spirit and his voice was level
and controlled as he asked

 what does it mean carse what
must we do

 leave eliot and at once we
have no choice our danger while
here is immense the asteroid in
the hands of enemies could crush
us like a fly simply by coming
down on the top of the hill

 but who could have taken it
there was no one on it was
there

 the hawk said wryly i
thought not but-well  ou remem-
ber the secret panel in dr kus
laboratory

 through which he escaped be-
fore yes

 i suspected that he might have
someone hidden behind it and i
intended to question him when he
was under the v- but in the ter-
rific rush of things it slipped my
mind sheer carelessness eliot
im very sorry i should have
known for when we captured ku
sui he spoke some words in
chinese through his helmet-radio
now i can see that they must have
gone to some man of his hidden
there and that man obeying in-
structions simply lay low heard all
that passed in dr kus laboratory
and then at a suitable opportunity
took the asteroid away in search of

allies he knows his master is a
prisoner here and unquestionably
he will be back to release him we
must be out of here and far away
by the time he arrives

  yes leithgow nodded slowly
as you say there is no choice
but your work here is finished
eliot carse went on if only we
can get to earth safely with ku
sui and the brains in their new
bodies we will have achieved
everything we wanted to achieve
we have proof of the crime done
you and we have ku sui too your
position will be restored and the
blame put where it belongs but we
must leave for earth at once god
knows how near the asteroid is or
whos on it

  all right carse the scientist
got up what are your instruc-
tions

  ban wilson appeared in the door
reporting that all the men had been
accounted for and awakened carse
started the wheels moving

  everything of value here must
be transported aboard the ship
eliot you know better than i what
to take so youll assume charge of
the loading ban you and all the
men save two of eliots assistants
will help ill need them to move
the bodies send them to me in the
laboratory but first be sure ku
sui and his four men are safely
confined all right lets go
within half an hour the general
evacuation was finished and the
ship loaded

the sandra leithgows ship
bearing his daughters name
was a sturdy vessel designed more
for comfort and utility than speed
and so her appointments including
offensive and defensive weapons
though modern were limited her
commodious cargo-holds were
easily capable of accommodating
all of the master scientists lab-
oratory instruments and devices
the passing of ku sui



the volumes of his extensive
library his great mass of personal
papers and more intimate effects
all the more important stores of
the place too and its furnishings
the laboratory and its surrounding
rooms were pretty well stripped

 the largest of the sandras
cabins was transformed under the
direction of leithgow into a hos-
pital bay and the five cots bearing
the prostrate unconscious bodies of
the patients put there though
hastily improvised this hospital
was complete as fully equipped and
nearly as efficient as if it were on
earth and not in the belly of a
space-ship the chances of the
patients for complete recovery were
not diminished in any way by the
sudden necessity for flight

  in a second much smaller cabin
dr ku sui was confined by him-
self its walls of course were of
metal and there was no possible
means of exit from it save by the
door which bore double locks the
eurasian silent and drugged and
stupid immediately stretched his
tall form out on the single berth
and in seconds was again sound
asleep a third cabin was made over
to his four assistants

  with everything completed the
underground refuge bare of articles
of value and the sandra stored
and made ready for the long trip
the inner door of the exit tube
swung open and the ship slid
slowly out of her cradle and into
the water chamber for the last time
her flight to earth had begun

  eliot leithgow stood near the
hawk in the control cabin and his
old face was made sad by many
memories for years this place that
he was now leaving had been his
only home his one sure haven
how carefully long ago had he
and carse planned it and built it
how many times had they met
there often when danger was close
and enemies near and cemented

still more firmly the bonds between
them to leithgow the hill sym-
bolized safety and friendship and
his beloved work dangerous weary
years those he had spent in the
hill but priceless nevertheless
warmed as they were by his
achievements and the friendship of
hawk carse

 now he was leaving it and going
back to earth the outlaw years it
seemed were ended ku sui was a
prisoner and the proof of his great
crime which had been laid to
leithgow was aboard earth-green
earth separate distinct peerless
in the universe home of men of
his kind he had loved and worked
and known honor and respect on
earth it held the grave of his
wife and the fresh warm young
love of his wife reincarnate his
daughter sandra he was at last
going home to earth from his exile
on this desolate raw frontier post

 there was a choking in eliot
leithgows throat at leaving the
hill and he turned away afraid at
that moment of being observed by
the steel-gray eyes of his friend
hawk carse   

the sandra swam up through
the lakes muddy tide and
launched herself dripping into the
warm air of afternoon her gen-
erators hummed with life given
them by the firm hand at the con-
trols and swiftly she arrowed forth
into the blue with a few words as
to the visual course carse handed
the space-stick over to friday and
devoted himself to the matter of
the watches

  satellite iii dropped swiftly to
concavity then as the sandra was
expertly jockeyed through the rare
outer layer of the stratosphere be-
came a true globe again the negro
reported

 through the atmosphere suh
orders

  full acceleration continue vi-


astounding stories

ually for the present ill work out
the true course in a few minutes
yes suh

  the hum of the generators deep-
ened in a matter of ten minutes
shipboard routine was arranged
carse friday and ban splitting the
watches the hawk as was his cus-
tom took the first friday was re-
lieved of the space-stick and im-
mediately went back for sleep as
did wilson eliot leithgow did not
retire right away however

  he watched carse snap on the
automatic control and go to an
electelscope which had been
equipped with an infra-red device
he directed it rearward on satellite
iii back along the course the san-
dra had described and peered
through its eyepiece for several
minutes then he turned to the old
scientist

  nothing he said no sign of
the asteroid as yet well have to
keep careful watch the visi-
screens useless against the invisi-
bility of the asteroid and the high
magnification of this scope with
its resulting small field of view
will require us continually and
methodically to search through a
wide circle behind in the attempt
to pick up the asteroid should it
appear a tedious job with chances
of sighting it about even  at
any rate well have some sort of a
head-start he finished

this was the opportunity
leithgow had waited for he
wanted a few frank words with
his friend

  carse he said slowly i won-
der just where that man concealed
behind the secret panel would take
the asteroid

  ive thought about that too re-
plied the hawk we may be sure
that he went for allies dr ku has
several on satellite iii of them
all i think he would go for lar
tantril

  tantril

  yes i think so lar tantril the
venusian a fellow of much self-
confidence and one of ku suis
chief agents and who at present
-he smiled faintly-nurses a spe-
cial bitterness against me i told
you how i tricked him on his ranch
hed be very eager to pursue us in
the asteroid simply for the oppor-
tunity of repaying me for that
trick the adventurers left hand
rose to the bangs of flaxen hair
combing down over his forehead
and he murmured musingly i
rather hope it is lar tantril   
you hope so leithgow re-
peated surprised when he hates
you so and would be on the look-
out for tricks why

  i would guess eliot that lar
tantril is not notable for intellect
blustering domineering - pretty
much of a braggart you know cer-
tainly he is not a model of caution
and he is not acquainted with dr
kus asteroid for he did not even
know it existed he will be able to
run it of course with the advice of
this hidden man but surely he
will not have the perception to dis-
cern the weakness in it yes i hope
it is he

  leithgow went on to the main
thing on his mind

  im a little unsettled carse he
admitted ive been imagining this
as the end of my outlaw years and
the beginning of my re-establish-
ment on earth but this ship is
slow and i see now that if the
asteroid does pursue us and cap-
ture us    what do you really
think of our chances

the hawk pursed his lips
slightly and for a little while
he looked away and did not an-
swer when his voice came it was
tinged with bitterness

  eliot he said ive been try-
ing to find an excuse for my lapse
but there is none it was the blun-
the passing of ku sui



der of a novice my not remember-
ing to question ku sui about that
secret panel that was the cardinal
point yet it slipped my mind in
my preoccupation with the emer-
gencies connected with the restora-
tion of the brains

  our chances are only fair eliot
im telling you frankly how it ap-
pears to me i believe well be pur-
sued and if we are the odds are
greatly against us the asteroids
far more powerful than we and
jupiter only knows what new of-
fensive resources ku sui may have
given it i had no time to study
the several strange mechanisms i
saw in its control room then
no nearby patrol ship would help
us if we were attacked for to them
our enemy would be invisible and
theyd think us crazy

  he paused but seeing the somber
expression on the others face he
smiled and cuffed him on the back

 but maybe we wont even be
pursued eliot maybe well be too
far ahead for them to catch us
no doubt ive made it look too
serious so cheer up were alive
weve got everything we wanted
and were hitting at full speed for
earth and you know the luck of
that space-adventurer they call the
hawk

  leithgow smiled gently in an-
swer then left the cabin for the
sleep he needed so badly hawk
carse was left alone on watch in
the fleeing sandra

  a lonely intent figure he stood
over the chart-table working out
their best course to earth pres-
ently however he went back to the
infra-red electelscope and swept it
over the leagues behind carse
could not detect any sign of the
asteroid but he remained for a
little while at the eyepiece staring
at satellite iii there it lay a
diminishing globe three-quarters of
it gleaming in the light flung by
jupiter dark patches mottled it

they would be the jungles and
there was the scintillant sheet that
was the great briney lake with
port o porno nearby on the other
side of the little world now lay
the hill containing leithgows lab-
oratory all going    going   
falling swiftly behind satellite
iii scene of so many clashes plots
and counter-plots where so many
times he and eliot leithgow had
fought off the reaching hand of
ku sui-soon it would be a million
miles away what adventures
would he have before he saw it
again   

 a little sound came from the
hawk a half-sigh abruptly he
called one of the men on his watch
and stationed him at the scope and
then he returned to the chart-table
and the work of calculating their
course to earth

      chapter xiii
      in earths shadow

hour after hour and day after
day for a week the sandra
tracked on through the boundless
leagues the waxing sunlight beat-
ing steadily on her starboard bow
and her silent gravity-plates and
singing generators bringing earth
ever nearer friday who possessed
an extensive knowledge of all the
practical sciences did extra service
in the role of cook and his regu-
larly served meals disguised the
undifferentiated hours of space into
earth-mornings noons and nights
watch in and watch out and noth-
ing to disturb the even routine

  as for the ever-feared pursuit
there was no sign of it syste-
matically and carefully the men
stationed at the electelscope turned
it through the region behind but
never did their watching eyes dis-
cern the bulk of the asteroid its
disappearance and the kindred
mystery of who had been on it re-
mained unsolved


astounding stories

  therefore peace came to eliot
leithgows face and the tiredness
left his eyes the long hunted
years were beginning to be washed
from him and daily to carse he
appeared younger often in the
control cabin or over a meal he
talked of what lay ahead and the
happiness earth held waiting for
him there was his daughter san-
dra whom he had seen last as a
girl of fourteen and even then in-
terested in his work she would be
matured now and she would per-
haps be eager to help him in the
work he intended to resume there
was so much of it discoveries
theories evolved during his fugi-
tive years-now he could complete
them and give them to his old
circles of brother scientists all
this was in his conversations but
secret and unworded in his thoughts
were anticipations of the old dear
beauty of earth that beauty for
which his ageing heart had pined
so long   

  and earth was drawing nearer

nother week passed

 twice a day the door of
dr ku suis cabin was unlocked
and he was brought out under
guard for several turns through
the ship though for safetys sake
they continued to dose him with the
v- it was apparent that the gas
had less and less effect on him
four then eight then twelve times
a day they regassed him-as often
as they dared considering its ulti-
mate destructive mental effect-
but more and more of the frankness
and serenity foreign to his green
eyes melted away gradually the
normal veil came to hide their
depths and make them enigmatic
and sometimes there was again on
his face the hint of something
strong and tigerish and cruel lying
waiting they no longer trusted
him to attend to the five patients
he spoke seldom a tall reserved

figure in black silk attended either
by ban wilson or friday he
strolled through the ship for fifteen
minutes and was returned to his
lonely cabin of all the marks his
experience must have left upon
him the only one apparent was his
silence

 it was on the seventeenth day
that he forsook that silence and
directly accosted carse he had c
request the saffron face impassive
the long lashes lying low over the
eyes he said softly

 i wonder captain carse if i
might be permitted a glimpse of
the subjects of my transplanta-
tion

 leithgow and wilson were at
the time with carse in the control
cabin and they regarded their
friend intently curious as to what
the reply would be they saw his
steel-gray eyes meet dr kus gaze
squarely and the two men looked
at each other hawk carse com-
plete victor at last and ku sui
the vanquished

  the adventurer answered

 your request is only natural
dr ku certainly you may see
them and perhaps offer an opinion
on their progress which has so far
been in the hands of your assistants
but i shall have to accompany
you

  you are kind

  take the controls ban carse
directed and together they left the
cabin

there was no visible change
in the five bodies they lay
stretched out in cots sheets drawn
up to their necks and it seemed
almost as if they were quietly slum-
bering and would presently wake
up though in reality consciousness
would not return to the fine brains
in their hideous distorted bodies
for many weeks and then only if
the healing processes were success-
ful bandages swathed the heads
the passing of ku sui



leaving eyes and nostrils alone vis-
ible an assistant of leithgows
at present on watch there moved
occasionally with instrument in
hand to time the fevered pulses

 i must ask you to stand back
here dr ku said the hawk indi-
cating a spot some five feet from
the nearest cot his left arm hung
easily by his side the hand resting
by the butt of his holstered ray-
gun and the position was not acci-
dental

 ku sui nodded and doubtless
noted the gun but his eyes were
on the bodies he stood regarding
his own handiwork in silence his
face inscrutable and carse did not
disturb him at last in a low tone
he asked the assistant

 the food injections take suc-
cessfully

 the man nodded

 i remember the beautifully
modulated voice went on i was
not sure of one subject swansons
brain was it not is his condition
any better

  we are not sure

 ah yes    yes    he
appeared to muse and no one dis-
turbed him in the minutes of
silence that followed finally he
looked away and said

  it was a great feat thank you
captain carse i am pleased by this
glimpse of the miracle my hands
were made to perform i am ready
to return

  but at the door of his cabin he
paused and his eyes rested again
on the cold firm face close to him
he said

 i suppose captain carse you
intend to bring me before earths
world court of justice

  yes along with our living proof
of your abduction of the five
scientists

  the eurasian smiled i see and
since there is no questioning that
proof it would appear that earth-
lings will soon levy punishment on

dr ku sui    so  you know
captain carse i find your caution
a great handicap you keep gassing
me i am locked in and since i
have observed no excitement aboard
the ship apparently there are no
friends anywhere near me you have
stripped me of everything his
eyes lowered for a moment every-
thing save this ring

 on the forefinger of his right
hand set simply in a platinum band
was a large dark stone

  a black opal said dr ku i
have worn it for years and i prize
it highly perhaps at the last  will
give it to you as a memento of
these past years captain carse
and he went into the cabin where
they gassed him again

he third week passed

  crossing the orbit of mars
now approximately in opposition to
jupiter the sandra streaked on
into the last leg of her long voyage
the sun was a vast flame-belching
disk on her starboard side and
ahead lay earth growing each hour
cheerfulness pervaded the ship
nerves were relaxing faces lighten-
ing carse could not remember
when eliot leithgow had worn a
smile so constantly it was only
natural for to the old scientist and
his personal assistants earth was
home the fulfillment of every de-
sire the reality and symbol of nor-
mal life and love of man

 but to hawk carse the green
planet was not home he was the
adventurer and wanderer the
seeker of new places with the al-
luring lustre of peril earth was to
him little more than a port of call
and it brought him sadness to see
how eagerly leithgow stared at her
growing face tiieir parting was
not far away now

  the sandra logged off the miles
then came the day when only ten
thousand were left and soon after
five thousand deceleration had


astounding stories

long since been begun slightly but
unvaryingly the ships momentum
slackened until she arrived at the
two thousand mile mark where the
great curving stretch of the planet
filled her bow windows and the
well-remembered continents and
seas stood out as clearly as on a
tilted classroom globe

  carse leaned musing in a corner
of the control cabin oblivious to
the well-meaning but toneless voice
with which ban wilson at the
electelscope was butchering a song
a gentle tap on the shoulder sum-
moned him out of his study

  he turned and saw that leithgow
had come to him carse smiled at
the old scientist and said

  well eliot well be in soon
now apparently weve made it
safely and theres nothing to stand
between you and the day youve
waited for so long

es but carse-what of you

x how long will you stay i
only wish i could persuade you-

  to retire eliot settle down
become a humdrum landlocked
earthling he chuckled and shook
his head no no old friend oh
ill stay on earth for a few weeks
i suppose ill have to to testify
before the world court of justice
when it takes up your case but
after thats settled ill be going
back you know me eliot ill
never change there are a number
of things i must attend to at once
my ship the star devil is still on
iapetus remember i must find her
and get her tuned up again shes
the fastest craft in space bar none
then i must make the round of my
ranches and see that things are
running smoothly ive a lot of
work on the iapetus ranch particu-
larly then theres that pool of
radium-not that i need the
wealth if it really exists but the
job has killed so many who have
sought for it that id like to take

a crack at it myself oh plenty to
do

 leithgow looked at him and
there was all affection in his eyes
and friendship as close as it can be
between men

 no carse said leithgow
softly i suppose earth will never
get her gravity on you for keeps
but i hope you will come down
occasionally to see me and perhaps
once a year say spend a month
with sandra and me in our-
carse

 ban shouted the name out his
face turned from the electelscope
was alive with excitement

 here look

 what is it

  the asteroid its close

 in two strides carse was at the
eyepiece of the infra-red glass at-
tached to the instrument one look
through it served to verify bans
report the asteroid of dr ku sui
had at last appeared

it was not more than fifty miles
from the sandra a craggy frag-
ment of rock peanut-shaped and
tipped by its gleaming dome its
speed seemed the same as theirs
but its course was different and to
carse that fact immediately ex-
plained its sudden appearance he
turned from the eyepiece with a
face grown hard and cold

 well its happened he said
instead of a stern chase which
would give us some chance of
spotting them they at once got off
to the side and have all this time
been flanking us now theyre
cutting in straight behind no
doubt ready for business all right
ban sound the alarm

 like a gladiator about to step
sword in hand into the arena the
sandra though a ship never de-
signed for space duels girded her
loins and made herself ready for
what at its best could only be an
unequal struggle she was out-
the passing of ku sui



classed in weapons weight and
speed-in all save pilots she had
hawk carse at her helm

 the harsh alarm bell at once
rang through the ship an emer-
gency call to stations carse at the
controls rapped out another order

 defensive web on ban and
build up power for the ray bat-
teries

  as the echoes of the bell died a
piercing whine grew amidships and
shreds of blue light swiftly scat-
tered by the sandras ports they
were quickly gone but they left
behind an almost invisible envelope
of blue which enwrapped the ship
completely the defensive web
against attacking rays was on

  friday tumbled into the control
cabin and on his heels two of
leithgows assistants the third
being on duty with the patients
carse briefly explained what had
happened friday he ordered
you take the stern ray batteries
ban-

  but ban wilson had returned to
the electelscope and it had given
him more news interrupting he
cried out

  they must be attacking a light
just flashed in the dome

  with his words they all saw the
light the visi-screen though it did
not reveal the asteroid showed the
first weapon with which it struck-
a lustrous ray of purple which in
a blink had leaped out to the san-
dra and enfolded her a shower of
sparks crackled out from the ships
defensive web but the purple ray
continued

  i dont know that ray eliot
carse said whats on our speed
indicator

  the scientists gasp was plainly
audible as he read the dial why
it-its dropping much faster than
our deceleration accounts for that
ray-why it must have magnetic
properties carse the asteroids
stopping us

chapter xiv

the hawk strikes

no surprise showed on the
hawks face though the
others were visibly shaken he at
the helm merely nodded and con-
tinued with further orders

  williams he said to one of
leithgows assistants get thorpe
and go and dose ku sui with v-
give him plenty then both of
you station yourselves ray guns in
hand outside his cabin well take
no chances with him gassed or not
friday open our radio receiver to
the general band just the re-
ceiver not the mike    our speed
eliot

 down to seven hundred and
falling steadily

  carse went to the electelscope
after giving the controls over to
ban

  squarely behind the sandra and
within twenty-five miles the pea-
nut-shaped body had come it was
an ominous and silent approach
the sandra remained pinned by
the purple ray for minutes while
the hawk studied her aggressor as
he watched the asteroid the others
watched him ban wilson fidgety
friday clenching and unclenching
his big hands eliot leithgow with
whitened face and shoulders that
seemed to have bowed a little

  the forward speed of the san-
dra decreased to four hundred
miles an hour and still the hawk
studied the massive body be-
hind   

  a sputter sounded in the radio
receiver carse turned away from
the electelscope and listened to the
heavy venusian voice that was sud-
denly speaking to him from it

  carse ive got you youve seen
our ray of course but have you
looked at your speed indicator
youre caught-and this time youre
going to stay caught you cannot
possibly resist the magnetic ray


astounding stories

i have on you and in a few min-
utes you will be drawn right into
me i advise you to surrender
peacefully no tricks - though
theres no trick that could do you
any good nothing i have you this
time

  a frosty smile tightened the
hawks lips

  i was right eliot he mur-
mured the man behind the panel
took the asteroid to lar tantril
he is our opponent

those were his words but he
did nothing he seemed con-
tent to stand with cold intent face
looking back through the infra-
red electelscope the sandras
speed sank to three hundred two
hundred and soon a hundred and
the asteroid which was of course
also decelerating crept up re-
morselessly ban wilson had every
confidence in the hawk but finally
the inaction grew too much for
him to bear

  jumping jupiter carse he
sputtered -arent you going to do
anything use our rays try
maneuvering to the side damn it
were just letting them take us
the adventurer might not have
heard for all the sign he gave the
earth-clock on the wall ticked on
seconds built minutes and the min-
utes passed the asteroid was only
ten miles astern

  eliot said carse quietly get
me one of your infra-red glasses
he took over the controls again
carefully he varied the forward
repulsion and sent current to the
side gravity-plates and slowly the
sandra answered by rotating longi-
tudinally reversing her position
still maintaining a slight and
dwindling speed toward earth her
bow swung from that planets eye-
filling panorama and came to face
instead the invisible asteroid
when turned completely around
the men in her control cabin looked

through the bow windows right into
the brilliant cone of the purple ray

  lar tantrils voice again boomed
from the broadcasting shell and
this time it was harsh with anger

  try no tricks carse i see what
you intend you plan to suddenly
answer my ray instead of con-
tinuing to resist it and so drive
right past me and escape but i
warn you i have terrific power and
if you move towards me of your
own volition  can burn you to a
cinder in three seconds and ill do
it you cant escape if i have to
destroy ku sui all right-but ill
get you

the hawk strapped over his
eyes the infra-red glasses
leithgow now gave him

  reversing the sandras ends had
neither increased nor decreased the
rate at which the asteroids purple
stream was bringing her closer ob-
viously the magnetic stream was
being varied the space-ships for-
ward momentum merely continued
to drop normally until the moment
came when she had no earthward
velocity at all and then more
quickly she moved toward the re-
straining asteroid

  with his infra-red glasses
through the bow windows carse
could now see the massive body in
full defil there was the dome
a huge gleaming cup of transparent
stuff now showing wisps of blue
from the defensive web around it
and inside were the several build-
ings and minute black dots which
were the figures of men there was
a great number of them the largest
group was clustered inside one of
the large ship-size port-locks in
the dome the locks outer door was
open and it was from there that
the purple ray seemed to originate
obviously the intention of the
enemy was to draw the sandra
right in five miles now separated
asteroid and ship
the passing of ku sui



  again the venusian chief spoke
i warn you once more sparrow
hawk try no tricks you can see
the men i have here but you cant
see my ray projectors theyre
hidden but theyre centered on you
every one and my hands at the
control that fires them they have
terrific power carse better not
attempt anything

 the hawk switched on the ex-
tension microphone at his side he
said levelly into it

  lar tantril ill make a bargain
with you a favor for a favor
what shot from the loud-
speaker

  i will agree to surrender peace-
ably when youve drawn my ship
inside if for your part you prom-
ise to free eliot leithgow who is
aboard with me and the five
patients on whom ku sui operated
if you dont grant me that i will
oppose you to the last pull of my
finger on trigger

  but carse- the master scien-
tist began horrified but his ex-
pression of amazement faded when
the slender man at the radio turned
his head and half-closed one eye in
a wink

  you will agree to that-and no
tricks tantrils voice repeated

  i will agree to it and as for
tricks what could i possibly try
your rays could burn through the
maximum power of my web in
three seconds as you say i know
it as well as you i only wish there
was a chance to get out of your
range in time

  all right the venusian replied
decisively i agree ill release
leithgow and the five patients
keep away from the controls and
ill draw you in

carse switched off the micro-
phone

  a hell of a lot tantrils word is
worth muttered ban wilson
once more surprisingly the hawk

winked friday was grinning now
for once in his life he had guessed
his masters strategy before the
others

  a mile and a half to the front
lay the dome-end of the asteroid
perhaps nine hundred miles to the
rear lay the tremendous mottled
curve of earth with her dangerous
upper layers of the stratosphere all
too close in the very face of earth
all three on a line the ship lay
linked by a stream of purple to the
great rough-hewn errant asteroid
half the bulk of all three lay
sharply outlined against the black
of space by the intense yellow
light of the flaming distant sun

  the asteroid neared to a mile
then a half-mile hawk carse said
curtly

  ban when i give the word put
all the power weve got into our
defensive web load the generators
overload them tax them to the
limit that web must be as tough
as possible for five seconds

  got you carse

  youve - a trick ventured
leithgow timidly

  i think i have eliot lar tan-
tril might have caught on when i
turned the ship but unfortunately
for him his brain is incapable of
proceeding past a certain point   
all right ban

  feel it

  in answer to bans hands the
deck of the control cabin was liter-
ally vibrating under the mounting
speed of the generators in the
power-room the generators could
not stand that terrific overload
long they would burn out but
carse needed only a few seconds
of it

  the asteroid was a quarter of
a mile away seen through the in-
fra-red the dome loomed large

  all right whispered hawk
carse hold on

  with the words he unleashed the
sandras full acceleration


astounding stories

it was a risk and a big one but
the hawk had it calculated to a
fraction of a second and so with-
out hesitation he took the chance
a little less than four seconds to
reach his objective he reckoned a
little more than one second for
tantril to release the asteroids dis-
integrating rays as he had threat-
ened therefore about two and a
half seconds for the sandra to be
exposed to those rays the chance
that her defensive web could resist
them for that long would decide it

  from almost a standing start the
sandra swept ahead generators
humming her web a blue -mist
around her acceleration at the full
straight down through the heart of
the narrowing purple ray she sped
a hurtling metallic projectile hun-
dreds of tons in mass her stub bow
levelled dead at the dome

  after a second the asteroid bared
its fangs

  a cone of brilliant orange flamed
and washed around the sandras
bow and a storm of soundless
sparks engulfed her she was
caught in a maw of fire and held
there for the remaining terrific sec-
onds of her wild forward dash but
the seconds passed the hands of
hawk carse were delicate on her
controls and the sandra curving
slightly upward struck crashed
wrenched terribly in every joint
and then the jolt and the protest-
ing wrench and the spluttering
sparks were gone from her and
there was around her only the deep
silence of lifeless space

  at three hundred miles an hour
the sandra had nicked the upper
plates of the dome and streaked on
unharmed

  it was not necessary now to use
infra-red glasses to see the aster-
oid it was there in the visi-screen
for naked eyes but for seconds not
one of the men in the ships control
cabin thought to look the awful
acceleration and shock had dazed

them they had not known what

was coming except friday and the
hawk and only the latter was able
to retain reasonable alertness he
almost immediately after the im-
pact cut down the load on the
generators and brought the sandra
out of her mad drive forward ro-
tating the ship until she was facing
back towards the asteroid then all
of them looked through the bow
windows and what they saw told
the story in an instant

  its visible see-the invisi-
bilitys gone cried friday

a score of miles away the
body lay fully revealed its
starboard half gleaming hard and
sharp in the sunlight cautiously
the sandra drew closer carse gave
the controls to ban and examined
it carefully through the electel-
scope after removing the infra-
red attachment

  he saw that the keel of the san-
dra had torn a great mangled rent
in the dome and through this the
air had rushed out space had taken
possession the disintegrating rays
which had been burning at the
sandra had been snapped off with
the sheathing of invisibility in
that one wild second of impact all
the asteroids functioning mech-
anism had been destroyed lar tan-
tril had not thought quite far
enough he had not sealed the
buildings air-tight against a pos-
sible crashing of the dome and
for that reason alone he and his
men had gone down in full defeat
under the drive of the hawk

  shreds of flotsam drifting and
turning in space around the dome
now became visible-bits of wreck-
age hurled out from the tear and
also a number of white bloated
things which once had been the
bodies of men the outrushing tide
of air had taken them along and
now they drifted shapeless all of
a kind in the lifelessness of space
the passing of ku sui



 merciful heaven whispered
eliot leithgow staring at the des-
olation gone just snuffed out
the hawk took over again and
brought and held the sandra in a
position a quarter of a mile above
the now rapidly falling asteroid

  theyre all dead im sure he
said in a voice hard and emotion-
less as his graven face they must
be for the asteroid is now visible
and that means that the doors of
the power building were open in-
side and out all there is dead
machinery and men    still it
had to be done it was they or
we a variation of the trick we
used to escape from the dome be-
fore eliot and tantril of course
didnt expect it and protect himself
as ku sui did that other time its
all done now-yes its gravity-
plates too for see its turning
and fast murmured friday
the body was rotating around its
longer axis at about twice the speed
of an earth-watchs second hand
now the dome was sliding under
out of their sight the craggy rock
belly coming up to take its place
nine hundred miles away was earth
-rather less than that for the
body was now free to accept the
tremendous gravity pull of the
planet so near soon it would
plunge to destruction there   

a thought came to carse
and he said

  perhaps ku sui would like to
see what has become-

  on the last word he stopped and
whirled around his eyes were
suddenly intense and his face
startled

  i heard a hiss said friday
you too then it was a port-
lock carse turned to the visi-
screen look there he cried

  in the screen earth made a ti-
tanic background against which
a falling dwindling figure in a
clear-cut in the sunlight gleamed

space-suit down it went rapidly
even as they stared until it hung
just off the also-falling asteroid it
was obviously preparing to enter
the dome

  take the helm ban and watch
him carse ordered harshly and
ran aft from the control cabin

  leithgow and friday following
at once found him inside the open
door of dr ku suis cabin exam-
ining two figures stretched limp at
his feet the men were thorpe and
williams who had been set to gas
and guard the eurasian carse said
both dead poison look at
thorpes wrist

  on the right wrist of the dead
man was a line of red a scratch
and swollen discolored flesh was
ugly around it one cheek of wil-
liams bore a similar patch both
had been armed with rayguns but
now they were gone half to him-
self the hawk murmured

  yes poison it might have been
in the ring everyone else was in
the control cabin the men entered
the door ku sui was waiting-
quick death    well im going
after him

  not understanding still horrified
by the contorted face of the man
on the deck the other two gazed at
the adventurer

  but carse leithgow broke
out how can you how can you
possibly-

  hes gone back to the dome
the hawk cut in frostily he cant
make it to earth as he is now for
wed see him and easily be able to
pick him up no hes got some
reason for returning to the dome
something important he thinks
hes escaped    hes mistaken

  a shudder passed over friday
for hawk carses eyes had fallen on
him and they were deadly

  let me by eliot the man
whispered this time he goes or
i go but by the gods of space itll
be one of us


astounding stories

chapter xv
there is a meteor

his face set and cold carse
ran to the stores cabin just as
the eurasian must have hurried
there a few minutes before he
took one of dr kus self-propulsive
space-suits down from the rack and
slipped into it sticking a raygun
in the belt still not speaking he
glided to the rear port-lock leith-
gow and friday running alongside
and attempting to dissuade him
from the dangerous pursuit their
words were wasted carse gave
them only a faint smile and a few
directions

 keep the ship as close as you
can without danger no eclipse
im going by myself theres no
need to risk two if i dont come
out youve everything needed to
prove your case eliot-the re-em-
bodied brains ku suis four white
assistants-

  i tell you youre going to your
death youll be caught inside
earths attracting the asteroid now
and in a few minutes it will be
plunging through the atmosphere
with terrific speed the friction
will make it a meteor and youll
burn carse youll die in flames
you havent but a few minutes to
do the whole thing

 have to risk that eliot he
swung open the inner door of the
lock and stepped into the chamber
remember keep as close to the
asteroid as possible and a steady
watch for ku sui and me he
looked levelly at them white man
and black for a moment then
turned his face away thats all
good-by he said

the door swung shut in their
faces with a hiss of compressed air

 the hawk closed the face-plate
of his helmet and rapidly spun over
the controls another hiss and the
outer door moved wide he stepped
with force into space

the panorama below him was
breath-taking earth seemed al-
most to hit him in the face he
had not realized it was so close
the sheer mighty stretch of the
globe filled his eyes and for sec-
onds he could not focus on any-
thing else so overwhelming to his
vision was the colossal map it
reached away to left and right
before and behind and he was so
near that it seemed almost flat a
sun-gleaming plain on which stood
out in sharp outline the continent
of europe the atlantic ocean and
bordering it the edge of north
america

  to his left was the flaming orb
of the sun and directly underfoot
rotating against the vast back-
ground of the north atlantic he
now saw the asteroid glinting me-
tallically along its craggy length as
it swung over carse centered every
bit of power he had on it and at
maximum acceleration began to
overhaul his objective

  the asteroid was plunging free
to earth and the rate of its un-
controlled plunge was second by
second mounting tremendously but
carses power-fall quickly enabled
him to overtake it as the dome
swooped up in front of him and the
sunlight washed briefly over its
desolate buildings he looked hard
for a shape moving amongst them
without success doubtless the eu-
rasian was well inside by now

  the job of getting into the dome
was a hazardous one about every
thirty seconds the asteroid de-
scribed a complete rotation making
the rim turn at a speed of half a
mile a second and that made the
task of entering extremely danger-
ous to a man whose only protection
was the metal and fabric of a space-
suit misjudgment would either rip
the suit or dash him to instant
death he had to slip cleanly down
through the jagged tear in the
dome planning his swoop accu-
the passing of ku sui



rately to the fraction of a second

  never cooler the hawk made it
building a parallel speed equal to
that of the rotating dome he fol-
lowed it over in a dizzy whirl and
as the rent came below he shot
curving down and in with sufficient
precision and at once swiftly ad-
justed his gravity to offset the as-
teroids great centrifugal force

for alternating fifteen-second
periods the sunlight filled the
dome and its buildings and on
the tail of the first of these even
as the sable tide swept all vision
from him the hawk arrived at the
door of one wing of the central
building he had not seen ku sui
and he had no time for explora-
tion but he did have a hunch as to
where the eurasian had gone and
he followed that hunch a silent
giant-gray thing in the black si-
lence of the corridor grim intent
and seeming irresistible he swept
along it and every second he knew
that a raygun might spit from
where it had been waiting in am-
bush to puncture his suit and kill
him for whether or not ku sui
was aware that he was being
tracked by his old bitter foe carse
did not know

  the asteroid plunged down faster
and faster earths atmosphere with
all its perils of friction coming
ever closer and the great bosom of
the planet lying waiting to receive
and bury the rock hurtling towards
it throughout most of the leagues
of space that asteroid had tracked
on its masters diverse errands and
in many distant places the trails of
hawk carse and ku sui had crossed
and left blood and crossed again
and now those three-asteroid eu-
rasian and the hawk-were drawn
once more together for the spec-
tacular and epic climax now only
minutes away no power in the uni-
verse was to stop the plunge of the
asteroid it remained to be seen

how one or both of the two living
humans on it could get out in
time   

  but of all this nothing was in
hawk carses mind except the beat-
ing driving realization that few
minutes were left in which to play
out the last scene with reckless
haste he sped to where his hunch
led him the secret panel in dr
kus laboratory as he reached it
faint sunlight came filtering in
from somewhere and he saw that
the panel was open

  he looked within and dimly saw
a ladder reaching down into black
depths without hesitation he
thrust through the opening and
dropped into the blackness he
dared not lose a second

he hit bottom with a thud
changed his glove controls
and reached out in the darkness
he felt that he was in one end of a
passageway as rapidly as he could
his arms stretched wide all his
nerves and muscles and senses alert
he pressed along it

  continually he was thrown into
the rough wall at his right by the
centrifugal force of the asteroid
hpw far did the passageway ex-
tend was ku sui at the end of
it it occurred to the hawk that
the asteroid was a developing
shooting star eating up the few
hundred miles of life that re-
mained streaking down into the
atmosphere where waited quick
friction and incandescence-and he
down in the heart of it blind with-
out clue to what lay in front of
him ignorant of everything and
with only minutes in which to
achieve his end thered be no
heat-warning through his insulated
suit even now perhaps there was
no time to get out already the
deadline might have been crossed
he could not know he went on

  how far a hundred yards two
hundred easily that he thought


astounding stories

and still no variation in the black-
ness around him the passageway
seemed straight so he might now
be past the rim of the dome above

  then for just a second he saw a
faint wisp of light ahead

  automatically carses raygun
came up but in the time that
simple motion took the light was
gone and the blackness was as deep
and lifeless as before but he was
coming to something he went on
perhaps a little faster hot to dis-
covery the last emergency resource
of dr ku he took no pains to
avoid making noise for he knew
ku sui could not hear him through
the airless space between

  after another hundred yards or
so the light from ahead winked
again it was stronger only a sec-
ond of it but he now suspected
that it came at regular intervals
it was a machine perhaps working
under the hands of the eurasian
on-on with the seconds fleeting
by building to the small total
which would bring friction to the
asteroid and incandescence and
scalding death for him within it

  again suddenly the mysterious
light it left instantly as usual but
not before it revealed well ahead
the end of the passage quickly he
traversed the remaining distance
and felt around with his hands he
found what he half expected there
was an opening a doorway to his
right the room beyond surely held
the final secret of the asteroid
and if dr ku sui were anywhere
he was in there

carse restrained an impulse to
rush in deciding to wait for
the recurring light everything in
him told him that this vas the cli-
max that through the door to his
right lay the object of his chase
and in spite of his consciousness
of the plunging asteroid and the
up-leaping skin of earths atmos-
phere now so close he stood full

in the doorway gun ready waiting
seconds were precious but this
was the part of common sense he
needed the light to show him what
perils he must face he could not
go into that chamber ignorant of
the situation there

  for what seemed ages the fan-
tastic figure stood there the great
rock turning over and over with
awful speed dropping down earth
nearing death ever closer-and he
standing in silence and darkness
waiting to finish the feud he
might never escape he knew that
it might already be too late to try
but the core of the man his grim
and steely will would not let him
think of retreating towards safety
until he had faced dr ku sui and
decided the account between them
forever

  the wall of darkness melted a
ghostly light filtered through he
stared and in its brief maximum
saw before him a high bare rec-
tangular room hewn out of the
rock-and at its far side a man in
a space-suit ku sui brought to
bay

  but carse for one of the few
times in his life doubted his eyes
what trick were they playing him
for it was not a real sharp figure
that he saw it was an indefinite
one shimmering and elusive like a
mirage a prank of the strange
light perhaps but ku sui never-
theless ku sui trapped

 the hawk leaped forward with
outstretched arms to seize and hold
the eurasians motionless figure as
he moved the second of ghostly
light dissolved away and in the
blackness his eager reaching arms
closed on-nothing

  surely ku sui had been there
surely he had not just imagined he
saw him

baffled and coldly raging
the hawk whirled and groped
frantically the centrifugal force
the passing of ku sui



caught him off balance and hurled
him into a wall but dizzy he con-
tinued his desperate search sweep-
ing his arms all around him over
walls and floor and rising the ceil-
ing the tumbling asteroid banged
him unmercifully into the six sides
of the room but even as he was
flung he reached and felt in every
direction-felt without result

  in some incredible way ku sui
had eluded him the second the
light failed he must have slipped
by and escaped down the passage-
way behind the hawk could hard-
ly understand how it might have
been achieved but there was no
other explanation so with lips firm
set in his cold grim face he felt
to the doorway ready to track back
through the long unlit passage
he might still overhaul and capture
the other if there was still
time   

  but was there

  the passing seconds had not
been idle inexorably they had
brought him to earths atmosphere
he stared around the room in sheer
horror

  for its blackness was relieved
by the faintest of glows it was not
that of the recurring light it came
from the whole rock ceiling above
carse was overwhelmed by the
realization that within numbered
seconds the surface of the asteroid
would reach incandescence

  thoughts raced like lightning
through his head he could not get
free through the corridor and dome
behind that would take at least
three minutes and not a quarter of
a minute was left ku sui too if
he were in the corridor trying to
reach the dome was trapped and
finished a meteor flaming to earth
would be their common grave

  a searing hideous death trapped
within fiery walls of melting rock

  at that moment the regularly re-
recurring flash of light came and
under pressure of his great need

the phenomenon meshed with
understanding in carses mind that
light was sunlight it came at defi-
nite intervals as the dome side of
the asteroid rotated to face the sun

  and that light could reach the
room only by way of some channel
in the ceiling

in the waxing glow of the rock
above him carse swiftly found
the channel-a vertical bore several
feet wide in one corner of the
ceiling its rock sides glowed redly
and at their end was a round black
patch that caused his heart to leap
with hope outer space-and a
short straight escape to it in a
flash he saw how ku sui perhaps
had eluded him

  the eurasians prepared emergen-
cy exit would also be his

  he lost not a fraction of a sec-
ond turning his glove controls to
maximum acceleration he rose with
a rush into the bore despite his
good aim the asteroids centrifugal
force threw him heavily into one
red-hot side his heart went cold
would the fabric of the suit bum
through no time for such worries
-must make the frigid air outside
-fast-fast-never mind bumps-
quick out-and must stay conscious
-must stay conscious to exert re-
pulsion against earth

  like a projectile hawk carse shot
out of that tunnel of hell at a tan-
gent to the asteroid and in a di-
rection away from earth and in an
instant the doomed body was far
below him and streaking faster and
ever faster to the annihilation now
so near

 he fought to come out of his
dizziness shaking his head he
glanced back for sight of a minute
suit-clad figure had ku sui pre-
ceded him through the emergency
exit his shape should be visible
somewhere etched by the sunlight

  there was no sign of him

  carses eyes dropped to the as-


astounding stories

teroid he saw it already miles be-
low a breath-taking celestial ob-
ject a second sun brilliant and in-
creasingly brilliant as it diminished
over the watery plain waiting to
receive it his mind saw the eu-
rasian caught in the long corridor
to the dome already dead on this
last flight of his extraordinary ve-
hicle of space   

 the end came at once the sun
was quickly a great brilliant shoot-
ing star then a blinding smaller
one then its straight mad flight
through the heavens was over and
it was received in the waters of the
atlantic ocean and buried deep

  a cataclysmic burial a titanic
meteor an incandescent screaming
streak in the night-a cloud of bil-
lowing steam-a wall of water rear-
ing back from the strange grave of
the asteroid so far come from its
accustomed orbit around mars   
the thought came to carse that dr
ku sui had died as he lived spec-
tacularly with a brilliance and a
tidal wave and an earthquake to dis-
turb the lives of men

  and a sadness fell over the heart
of the hawk   

he roused from it in a moment
he felt heat in the rush of
events he had not before noticed

that his space-suit had started to
burn from the friction of his own
passage through the atmosphere
fortunately it was already cooling
off

  for in spite of his own leaving
speed and the added centrifugal
velocity the asteroid had given him
he had hurtled down after the
doomed rock and only then was
his building repulsion neutralizing
earths gravity and his initial
earthward velocity he had slowed
dowi just in time to keep his space
suit intact

  he came to rest in relation to
the earth and hovered there again
he scrutinized the black untenanted
wastes of space above far out ap-
proaching as rapidly as it dared
was the sandra

  he wanted to be sure so he cut
in his mike and asked leithgow if
they had through their electel-
scope seen ku sui leave the aster-
oid

  the anxious scientist told him
they had not

  with a slight sigh hawk carse
snapped off his contact and waited
till the sharp growing spot that
was the sandra should come drop-
ping down to pick him up and his
friends learn from his own lips the
story of the passing of ku sui

pygmy planet science

dear editor

  i am glad to attempt to answer the
question about the pygmy planet
proposed by mr gervais and mr daniel
in the june issue of astounding stories
in the story itself i had to ignore
several technical details connected with
the tiny world to avoid clogging the
action with explanation and running the
story beyond space limits for instance
as one descends into smallness sta-
tionary lights would change color be-
cause their wave-lengths would be
longer in proportion to the eye red
would vanish into the infra-red violet
would pass through the spectrum to red
and vanish also

  the science fiction story seems to be
a sort of game in which the writer
once he has made his hypothesis must
meet every objection of the reader with
a plausible scientific explanation all the
explanation of course ought to be in the
story but there is-unfortunately-a
limit to what can be put in  words
and some of the readers have become
very expert at this game of discovering
omitted details

  first regarding the weight of the
characters and other objects on the lit-

tle planet and regarding also the rea-
son that the little planet did not fall to
the floor i submit that characters and
planet were outside the influence of the
earths gravitation

 we know a great deal about what
gravitation can do but very little about
what it is suppose that gravitation is a
radiation see alvin j powers bulle-
tin of the american interplanetary so-
ciety april  and james mackaye
the dynamic universe scribners
which exerts pressure on all matters
and causes objects to attract one an-
other by shielding one another from
part of this radiation

  the smaller atoms of the tiny planet
ought to afford less resistance to this
radiation they might be almost trans-
parent to the frequencies of it that
affect ordinary matter allowing the lit-
tle world to float in the air and freeing
the characters from inconvenient weight

  on the other hand the decreased
atoms would be opaque to higher fre-
quencies of the gravity-radiation to
which the earth is transparent that
accounts for the gravitation of the lit-
tle world itself which drew the char-
acters toward it

  regarding the operation of the gaso-
line engine in the small world i sub-


astounding stories

mit that the expansion of the ignited
gases in the cylinders would be rela-
tively the same as before it was as-
sumed that the contracting atoms did
not change chemically

  at first glance it might appear that
the potential energy-and as well the
inertia-of objects translated into the
small world would be inconveniently
large but the energy-or mass-which
would appear to be lost is manifested
in the greatly accelerated time of the
little world

  finally in regard to the amount of
evolution that had taken place on the
pygmy planet let me suggest that the
evolutionary process there had been
hastened artificially it is thought by
many biologists that mutations are
caused by the influence of some radia-
tion-perhaps of the cosmic ray-upon
the germ plasm the scientist in the
story seeking to observe the results of
evolution would naturally adjust the
radiation of his sun to accelerate the
process as much as possible-jack

though they were swishing through air
the event was supposed to have taken
place some thirty thousand miles from
the moon is it generally conceded that
there is an atmosphere there

  now that this error has been checked
off you may come out of hiding mr

a burst of praise perhaps therell be
some denouncing to do but it wont be
a denunciation of you or the magazine
itll be of some of the censored-ed
who read your magazine

  hot perps hawk carse scores again
the affair of the brains was excel-
lent mr shirer of flushing l i
please pay attention ill admit that
most of the stories in astounding tend
toward the adventure side more than
anything else but anthony gilmore
makes one forget this as he holds you
enthralled wondering just how the
hawk can escape from the evil genius
the yellow peril incarnate dr ku

  that is the point i wish to stress
most stories of this type have the
villyun do everything in his power to
prevent the escape of the ero then
just as the ol meanie is about to send
our ero to perdition he gets a notion
that he is sleepy and promptly goes to
bed leaving the ero untied with the
assurance that he cannot escape our
ero then tries the bars of his cell and
finds that they are rusty and he breaks
them with ease clambers out goes to
the flying field and finds that an obliging
crew on one of the battle-wagons of
space has gone off on a spree in that
wicked degenerate town of port o
porno i suppose he goes aboard and
with marvelous agility ability-ed
works all the mechanisms and doodads
by himself the ship is loaded with
atomic bombs naturally he goes and
blows the villyun to the four corners
of the earth or mars or wherever the
locale of the yarn may be

  anthony gilmore gives a logical and
reasoning account for every step taken
by his character hawk carse thats
my contention and if mr shirer dares
to disprove it i challenge him to

  well well thats over mr bates i
hope you dont mind letting me denun-
ciate mr shirer that way it gets my
dander up when anyone criticizes need-
lessly a perfectly good story-fred c

dear editor

  i offer a version of astounding sto-
ries which you no doubt will learn is
 scandalization of shakespeare

 friends readers and editors lend
      me your ears

 of all the bunk that i yet have
     read

 it seems the most strange to me
 that men should buy and print
 such literature as is in this queer
 thing

 the like of which i have before
     not known

 seeing that anytime and anywhere
 much morell be got and better too

 i write to scorn and not to praise
     you

  evil is oft interred in mens works
  the goods invariably left behind

  so let it be with this

 here under invitations of the edi-
      tor

 for he is a bungling buncoe-

 so are they all all bungling bun-
     coes-

 come  to scorn and insult you

 the noble readers have said that
     this were good

 if this be so it is a surprising
     thing

  and surprisingly have i answered it
  this was once mine own but cold
  and cruel to me

 the noble readers say that it were
     good

  but they are all suckers so they are

 it hath did much dirt to me

 which hath mine temper roused

 doth this in it seem good

 yet the noble readers say that it
     were good

  but they are all suckers so they are
  when that the readers have cried
  this hath laughed

 did this in it seem good

 goodness should be made of better
     stuff

 you all do know that ofttimes
 it hath refused us even edges

 yet the noble readers have said
 that it were good
 but they are suckers so they are
 you cursed it once not without
 cause-

 what cause withholds you then

 to scorn and leave it now

 oh judgment thou art fled to
 brutish beasts
 and men have lost their reason   
 bear with me-

 a nnouncement

 dear editor

 the international scientific associa-
 tion wishes to inform the readers of
 astounding stories of the completion of
 its reorganization

 interesting additions to the work of


astounding stories

the club are now being discussed and
in all probability  will see a great
expansion in the scope of its work in
order to determine whether this expan-
sion is entirely feasible i would like to
ask that all who would like to aid in
improving their favorite science fic-
tion and also aid in the great work of
making the world science-conscious
write to aubrey a clements sec i s
a  w peachtree st atlanta ga
and inform him of their interest

  i would like to make clearer here
the relationship between the interna-
tional scientific association and science
fiction i have heard it expressed that
there is no real attachment because the
club deals with science and theory while
the aim of the magazine is to furnish
amusement and pastime a fact to be
remembered is that the club has been
formed for the express purpose of- ad-
vancing science and we have discovered
that one of the best ways to advance
science is to advance science fiction

  often science is not easily brought to
the interest of the younger students
mainly because of its technical nature
and the extreme dryness of the modern
textbook science fiction serves in the
capacity of giving initial interest it
initiates the amateur scientist to the
right road it develops his interest and
fosters a desire to know more thus he
begins to study and because of his in-
tense interest learns more science in
one short year with the help of science
fiction than he would learn in four
years at a university soon the advanced
person enjoys the monthly examination
of his prowess placed before him by
the authors he delights in his ability to
discover errors and discrepancies here
science fiction firmly and sharply im-
plants its readers previous knowledge
beyond all possibility of forgetfulness
so the best way to advance science is
to advance science fiction-raymond

  announcement science fictional the
fantasy fans fraternity

  science-fantasy differs from the usual
run of book and magazine fiction in
many ways but primarily in the unflag-
ging loyalty and alert interest of its
many followers no other class of read-
ers can compare in these respects with
genuine science fiction fans it is for
them that the fantasy fans fraternity
is being launched

  there are no restrictions no recom-
mendations are needed girls boys men
women may join freely all lovers of
the diverse forms of fantasy are in-
vited this goes for you strange tales
readers too there are no dues or fees
of any kind except a very nominal
charge only a trifle more than a new
copy of the magazine you are now read-
ing for a membership card this card
allows the fraternizers special privileges
and derives them much benefit

dear editor

  i have been reading your magazine for
five months and words cannot express
my appreciation of it we have nothing
even approaching it among our fiction
magazines in england

  in my opinion the stories are just
right and i would not for one moment
concede to those who wish the feminine
element suppressed a little romance
just adds that which is required to make
the story seem real

  i would very much like to correspond
through the medium of your paper with
american friends of both sexes if any-
one would be sufficiently interested in
an english boy of a kindred taste in
literature to write to me-john staple-

a eulogy of a sort

  dear editor

eulogy to mr hamilton

  oh mr hamilton-

  when the earth is plagued by in-
      sects

  when our globe is plunged into fire
  when this world is whirled by
  comets-

  send for edmond hamilton esquire

  when our world seems doomed by
     monster men

  or when the reds menace our na-
     tion

  when plights and blights our fair
      world threaten-

  shout for hamilton by all in holy
      creation

  when the war-god mars descends
     from the stars

  when gnome-men burst from the
     bowels of the earth

  when this planet of ours is rocked
      by jars-

  it will give mr hamilton a chance
      to prove his worth

  when atomic energy is set free

  when glaciers great divine our fate
  when scientists mad loose the power
  they had--
  send for hamilton he will save us
  he

  when diabolic rays disturb our ways
  when the sun goes out as it will
  no doubt

  when the world gets a shave and
      no one us can save-

 yell for edmond-you and you for
     he most certainly will us rescue

  if venus us battles and the death-
      knell rattles

 if deluges this realm ever over-
     whelm

  if afflictions strange do us derange-

  leave it to eddy to gain our liberty

  world-saver inc life-saver and
     how

  mr hamilton take your bow

  your talents deep you must safely
     keep

  or our fair race will never sleep

dear editor

 by the way let me say i think you
did a very sporting thing in placing
your evaluation of the stories in that
long list o two of your readers in one
of the recent corners once i severely
criticized you for printing an unsporting
criticism of dr smith but i guess
youre a pretty good sport after all-

an absolute genius

dear editor

  i first started reading astounding sto-
ries in september  and all i could
say after reading it was why have i
been missing such a good treat for over
two years

  i think the best story i have read is
the affair of the brains theres no-
body like gilmore for writing a good
story wandl the invader made a
good second

wholl explain

dear editor

  astounding stories is in its third year
now and i still have the same complaint
that i had after reading the first issue
not enough science too many hare-
brained adventures now please dont
take me for one of those guys who want
about two or three pages of higher
mathematics explaining why a character
ate an egg but i do want a foundation
of science in every story i am a high
school boy who has a queer idea that he
can be educated and still enjoy himself

  i have an idea or two concerning the
color of space this has been discussed
in the corner and it has i believe
been said that the blackness of night

sroved the absence of light in space

tow we know that night is caused by


astounding stories

the rotation of the earth that is half
the earth is in its own shadow there-
fore i have come to the conclusion that
space is black only in the shadow of
some large body although this conclu-
sion seems very obvious i am doubtful
about it because of the lack of air in
space on which light may reflect will
someone please point out my mistake-

dear harry

  this a true incident might get a
laugh in your corner wisdom from
childish lips our six year old daughter
betty starr whom you will remember
was with a group of youngsters each
telling how her father was the best at
something of everybody in the world

  betty spoke up proudly and loudly

  well my daddy writes the best sui-

corner first

dear editor

  your may issue of a s was superb
and outstanding every story was good
with the exception of pirates of the
gorm of which the plot was old

  as usual i turned to the corner
first and found a good assortment of
letters i agree with arthur hermann in
his idea that an atom can be inhabited
but the time difference would be so
great that it would be impossible to
traverse in between and have the same
people as before

  that was some letter by henry ray-
mond it seems to me that we could all
afford to think for a few months and
then write our letters or not at all-
thos r daniel box  sidney nebr

more science

dear editor

  why do you persist in dishing out
that rubbish about time travel why
that wouldnt make a decent fairy story
much less a bona fide scientific story
i know tastes differ but it is my opin-
ion that anybody who gets a kick out
of such rot should have his head exam-
ined at once a little more science mr
editor if you please i deduce that all
our readers are more or less of a scien-
tific turn of mind otherwise they
wouldnt be interested in such a s and
how about cutting down on those things
none of us know anything about such
as fourth dimensions invisible worlds of
vibration etc

  but taking it all together i think this
is a great little magazine the pictures
and size are okay with me and i see no
sense of going to the expense of smooth-
ing down the edges of the leaves its
the contents im after

  if anyone near my own age 
wishes to correspond with me i will
welcome the idea enthusiastically es-
pecially those who are deeply interested
in science and invention-ben anderson
gainesboro tenn

until then

dear editor

  i consider harl vincents characters
to be the most boorish ill-tempered
bad-mannered suspicious lot it has ever
been my misfortune to encounter he
uses more grunts snarls hisses gloats
and similar terms to the square inch than
any ten of your other writers combined
his heroes are always losing their tem-
per at the slightest provocation if vin-
cent thinks that he is injecting realism
in his tales by such methods he is sadly
mistaken usually its only the inex-
perienced writer who uses such a style

  with the exception of vulcans work-
shop the stories in the latest astound-
ing were all excellent i was agreeably
surprised by simaks tale some of his
work in other science fiction magazines
was not so good but hellhounds of the
cosmos was really original and had a
good ending which just goes to prove
that astounding accepts only the best

this thing so strange

dear editor

  one thing i find strange in the
martian cabal-the way princess sira
fell in love with the hero after having
seen him for such a short while i really
think he deserved to be reprimanded for
kissing a strange female the moment he
met her

  ah well-the ways of you americans
are strange to me

   i think love comes much too easily to
 these young people in your stories-too
 easily to be natural perhaps though
 men and women of the remote future
 will control their emotions to such an
 extent that they can fall in love at will

  several of your authors have antici-
pated me in their imaginings for in-
stance space ships which fly by the
control of gravity electromagnetic bar-
rages round space ships i have de-
vised a disintegrator curtain round ships
to destroy wayward meteors but i
dont think anyone over your side has
considered the control of the motion of
electrons in the atom so as to produce
flight in a desired direction or drawing
upon the unlimited stores of energy in
space or the ether if you like to call
it that space is a vast field of energy
which concentrates in places into island
universes suns and planets if power
could be taken directly from surround-
ing space it would work our machines
the readers corner



and pass back to space again hows
that for perpetual motion i suppose i
cant send you a story myself so you
can take or leave the above suggestions
as you will

  many readers dont seem to under-
stand the workings of time travel its
really quite possible if you have the
machine to have a real existence a
body must have four dimensions length
breadth thickness and duration there
is no difference between them except
that your immaterial consciousness
moves along the dimension of time at
exactly sixty minutes per hour from the
moment of birth to the moment of
death events do not happen we merely
come across them in the course of our
mental drift along the time dimension

  readers who still dont understand
should read the first chapter of the
time machine by h g wells the
popular english author i say without
reserve that i owe my special knowl-
edge on the subject to him

  i agree with mr raymond however
that time-travel would not be a good
thing for the whole world but would
bring chaos and confusion if i invent
one no doubt ill take a trip myself
but ill keep the secret to myself-

dear editor

  i just finished the june issue of
astounding stories and in my estima-
tion it was the best i have ever read
if i were judging stories all four
would rate a with me especially the
raid on the termites and hellhounds
of the cosmos the ending in the lat-
ter story practically doubled the rating
as i never read serials until i have all
the installments i have not tried to rate
two thousand miles within as yet
but if this story is as good as the ones
in the past it doesnt need rating itll
be just a natural a

  i vas very glad to see that the cor-
ner was back to its usual eight pages

  that to me is the most important
feature of the magazine

  its impossible to classify astounding
stories because it gets better each

amateur issue

dear editor

  i have just finished reading the june
issue of astounding stories as usual
the stories were first rate and i enjoyed
them very much

  a little suggestion in letters to the
corner i have seen that many of the
readers think they can write stories
some have even threatened to write in

order to get the type of stories that they
want well why not why not hold an
amateur story writing contest for the
readers i think that if you gave prizes
for the best stories written by the read-
ers interest in the book and in the
corner would increase you may even
be able to use some of the best stories
in the magazine itself how about it in
this way you may be able to discover
some new writing talent please print
this in the corner and see what some
of the other readers think about the
idea maybe some of those who disagree
with your authors on some points can
show us something better than ordinary

  your issues of a s are mostly good
but manape the mighty and the
mind master is stuff that is mental
drivel

  even a layman would know that the
blood composition and physical organ-
ism of an ape would not suit a modern
white mans brain and the brain cavity
is not only wrongly shaped but much
too small and even a mad scientist
would know that an apes body is not
desirable

  physically inferior to a healthy adult
male in legs and spine and manipulative
power for human movements brutishly
superior in arm force-but why waste
words on drivel the author has power
and should employ his undoubted talents
to better advantage

was the author thinking of the biblical
sons of god when they walked the
earth and saw the daughters of man

begorrah

dear editor

  two years ago a great troke of luck
came my way i was passing a news-
stand one day when astounding stories
on top of a pile of other magazines
caught my eye as it looked rather out
of the ordinary i thought id give it a
try and ever since that day ive been
haunting the newsstand of dublin look-
ing for more

  what i like most about a s is the
ideal mixture of fiction and science
without one the other would fall flat
for its very much easier to be inter-
ested in and to remember scientific de-
tails when they are in the form of a
story and not a treatise

  there is however one thing that i
consider impossible-time-traveling its
all up the spout begorrah i could
travel back a few years and kill my
own dad before he married if it were
possible and then where would i be
but why kill poor dad-ed or on
the other hand i could wait until he got
married to my mother and be born
again and thus hear my other baby self
saying goo-goo sounds queer doesnt
it as for future traveling whats to
prevent me traveling  years into the
future finding the skeleton of my long-
dead son and bringing it back to 
then when i do marry and have a son
im single at the moment i shall be
able to say to him patrick behold
your own skeleton about  years after
you died

  it might be possible to jump into the
future but it would be impossible to
get back again because during the
travel into future things would have
been happening on earth just the same
and when anythings done well its
done and cant be undone my own
humble opinion is that there might be
one possible way of future traveling
imagine a machine or a drug which
would act as an anti-stimulant on the
human body and nervous system thus
the heart lungs brain senses muscles-
everything including the mind-might be
made to function several thousand times
slower thus two thousand years would
pass and seem only like one year to a
human so treated obviously he could
not get back again but the idea sounds
plausible does it not
