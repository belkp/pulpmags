how do your last two years
compare with his

ttiere are two kinds of
managers just as there are
two kinds of superintendents
engineers salesmen and ac-
countants

  one says i am so busy
that i cannot possibly do any
outside reading he does
none

  the other says i am so
busy that i do not see how
i can possibly find time for
outside reading but i must

he does

  t f peirce manager of
the pacific desk company
was very busy altho i know
that the alexander hamilton
institutes course must have great merit
because of its national reputation i am not
in a particularly receptive mood he wrote
my work is quite engrossing i do not con-
sider that i have time 

  but there is a difference between having a
busy mind and having a closed mind mr
peirce was not afraid to face the facts about
himself he sent for forging ahead in busi-
ness as a kind of test-to see just wherein
his own training fell short i very quickly
discovered one thing he wrote frankly
and that was how little i actually knew
about the science of business

  within a few weeks mr peirce had found
information in the institute course which had
an immediate cash value to him a few months
later he had persuaded twenty-five of his prin-
cipal associates to enrol with the institute

mr t f peirce president
of the pacific desk company writes
when a man clips a coupon from one of
your advertisements he puts himself in
touch with the strongest lifting power in
modern business

  in one of the advertise-
ments of his company in the
los angeles papers mr peirce
announced these enrolments
as evidence that the pacific
desk company was in a posi-
tion to give better service to
business men by having in
its organization men thoroly
trained in business

  the next step follows nat-
urally and inevitably

  on october   mr
peirce wrote i want you to
be the first to know the good
news and that is that i have
been elected to the presi-
dency of the pacific desk
company and have taken over the entire con-
trol of its stock  i believe your course
has had much to do with making me ready to
grasp this wonderful opportunity when pre-
sented to me and i desire to give full credit
where credit is due

  perhaps you are a department manager or
a salesman or an accountant or an engineer
you have your eye set on the high places of
business but they seem a long way off the
alexander hamilton institute can shorten the
distance between the place where you are and
the place where you want to be it has proved
that in the careers of many thousands of men
will you take their word for it that forging
ahead in business is a guide book worth

     in many respects this is the most remarkable novel the blue booh mag-
     azine has ever published incidentally it is its authors first serialized
     long story its original title was the clear pane the significance of
     which will be apparent to the reader when he takes up the third and last
     installment in the march issue what mr horn has tried to show in his
     vivid realistic work is the exact status with himself of a private in that
     vast army of floaters in america the men who work when work is
     absolutely necessary but only then-who at other times are tramps
     the florida kid in this story is a personality of such dominance in the
     world he inhabits that it has been deemed best to let the story carry
     as its title his trampdom monaker you will remember him and
     recall portions of his philosophy and incidents in his lurid life long
     after most stories are forgotten it is this quality of reality and author-
     ity that adapts the story so admirably to the blue book magazine

train later in the morning on a grade to
the west

  the sun lifted over straggling low hills
and the seventeen rose to greet its coming
leaning out over the side of the car
stretching their necks beyond the ends of
the pipe they ventured recklessly to gather
warmth into their bodies they knew
nothing for the moment except that
warmth was in this coming of light sun-
light heat they were drunk with its
coming they were sun-worshipers

  br-r-r  one mans teeth clicked as
he spoke through clenched jaws im
s-stiff with cold

  gawd that nights past was the
thanksgiving of another

dodies stretching gratefully and pain-
fully pinched faces uplifting to the red
sun these worshipers devoutly greeted the
new day-warmth gone was the fear of
being seen by others-the wanderer is a
silent slinking creature gone was the im-
pulse to crouch to peer watchfully all
other sensations of life were subordinate
to this reveling in the coming of comfort
the lip-lip-lip of the wheels on the rail-
joints the burring of the rails the rumbling
of the heavy train-all these sounds were
dead to their ears they knew nothing
felt nothing had no sensations-but heat
heat the steam that rose from the dew-
soaked grass the thin wisps of smoke that
ribboned from chimneys all added to this
illusion of comfort heat literally their
bodies bathed in it warmed was their
imagination marvelously renewed to meet
another day followin a night of suffering

  to awaken their sluggish veins two or
three of the riders started a halting stiff-
legged circuit of the car others fell into
line back of them in a movement of a
strange serpentine dance still others
jumped stiffly up and down cursing when
a cramp struck their toes and insteps
activity thus came they had been bugs
worms slugs frozen for months now sud-
denly enlivened with this coming of sun-
light no one in the world but them-
selves they believed knew how great is
this boon of a clear warm day

  as their bodies relaxed from the torpor
thoughts turned to the next creature com-
fort

  gawd im hongry exclaimed one

  som i another agreed sos every
bo all the time everywhere fourteen
meals a day wouldnt fill a hobo i eat

the blue

more in a day of bummin than in a week
of workin i-

  wonder if this burgll be good for a
meal another cut in

  hell no not with this bunch theys
fifty of us if theys one well git nawthin
here

  well its a-

  a head poking itself above the top of
the next forward car brought interruption
a body followed the head and legs the
body turning feet felt for the ladder on
the cars end

  theres the shack a wanderer whis-
pered

  necks craned some eyes showed fright
others held fight

  the brakeman came down the ladder
stepped to the wall of the gondola poised
an instant and dropped among the riders
he grinned but his eyes were cold and
shrewd roaming over the group sizing it
up-on his morning round gathering en-
forced payment for the privilege of riding
he stopped before a tall narrow-chested
youngster

  well well he called jocularly quite
a mob-quite a mob this bunch oughta
be good for breakfast dinner an supper
for the whole crew whatcha got on yuh
buddy

  narrow-chest hesitated turned to the
others saw no evidence of assistance from
them

  whatcha got to pay your ride shack
insisted

  not a jit im busted

  come on-come on none o that old
tripe stick up yr mitts fr a frisk

  narrow-chest obeyed and shack went
efficiently to his work in a trouser pocket
his fingers encountered something hard and
he drew it forth-a penknife expertly
he pulled out the three blades inspecting
them he dropped it into a pocket

  thatll do he announced worth a
quarter mebbe

  still grinning coldly he turned to another
of the group quietly quickly efficiently
he made his morning round until after he
had collected two pocketknives a pair of
cuff-links and a safety razor in addition
to several dimes nickels and quarters
something in the attitude of those about
him gave warning in his next words he
sought reinforcements

  any union men among you he asked
a medley of answers came

  mister im a molder
book magazine



by charles horn

  im a machinist cap

  look at my card im a barber

  hands quickly sought in pockets dingy
leather and leatherette folders were brought
forth and displayed to shack who nodded
agreeably he felt safer now-was cer-
tain of a split in the ranks should trouble
come

  you fellas with the cards are all right
he announced ride to helangone he
turned you-over there whatcha got
on you

  he called to a man of tremendous size
one who stood at the extreme end of the
open space leaning against the pile of pipe

  im a heavy structural-steel worker
cap

  got a card

  yeah structural steel displayed it

  shacks sweeping gaze moved over the
group and settled on an old man an um-
brella-mender seated in a comer a small
satchel was between his knees a bundle of
steel ribs bound tightly together with the
covering of an umbrella lay on the floor
at his side

  hey granpa-what you say shack
roared you aint said nothin yet kick
in you old guys is alius heavy wit jack

  granpa lifted watery eyes shivered
peered up to the great bulk of structural
steel and made two or three faltering at-
tempts at speech before he quavered in a
voice palsied with extreme age

  please mister im a structural-steel
worker too a light structural-steel worker
he held up the bundle of ribs as evidence
of his words

  he waited fearful of the frisking-
waited peered about until a crackle of
mirth struck the men and until the brake-
man doubled over in heavy laughter
waving his hand in dismissal shack turned
away

  too good granpa youre a fast
thinker ride on then to the others
well guess ive made you all anybody
else-wait heres two live ones i nearly
missed

a lertly he moved toward two young-
sters who stood aside in a corner one
of these was a towhead a tight-shouldered
smiling-eyed fellow small of frame wiry
nineteen or twenty years old apparently
the other was older taller heavy of frame
perhaps twenty-five six feet one inch one
would reckon his height his eyes were
gray cold calm with a hard calculating

weighing light in them he had square jaws
massive jaws cleft chin in every way he
was indescribably completely different
from any other man in the car his over-
alls seemed to fit him more snugly than
the garments of the others fit them his
actions and manner even as he stood at
ease coldly watching the brakeman ap-
proach spelled preparedness just as the
actions of the other wanderers were heavy
with indecision one got the impression
that here was a ready man-ready to meet
the world ready of thought capable

  the tall mans red hair straggled from
beneath the edges of his broken cap his
broad heavy hands were roughened by
wind and weather broken seams on them
filled with grime his body needed the
complete attention that only soap and
water-warm water and plenty of soap-
will give and yet with all of this di-
sheveled appearance there was nothing re-
pulsive about the man he had the ap-
pearance somehow of the workman the
thoughtful capable workman who was
temporarily at an unpleasant task

  while the brakeman had been making
his morning call this man-called the
kid by his solitary companion-lounged
in the corner leaning against the side of
the car hands deep in his pockets his
hard eyes followed the activity of shack
his upper lip curled once or twice in dis-
dain at this shaking down of those who
had little yet the scene was an old one
to him now with the brakeman drawing
near to him his elbows lifted to the side
of the car his body at ease and in that
simple movement came another evidence-
peculiar this evidence too rather startling
when one is not accustomed to it-of the
mans semblance of power he had merely
drawn his hands from his pockets and
leaned backward at his ease yet one
sensed the immediate focusing of the facul-
ties of his mind and body

  towhead grinned nervously peering up
at the red-haired man

  hes going to work us over kid tow-
head muttered

  the other smiled his hard gaze not wav-
ering from the eyes of the brakeman who
stood before him

  well-well-well-heartily from shack
nearly missed you two eh

  no answer still the waiting nervous
grin from towhead and the cold smile
from the tall man

  well whatcha got on yuh shack
the florida kid

barked dont look sprised make it
snappy

  shacks hand went out a grasping ges-
ture the kid moved one arm ever so
slightly pushing away the advancing fin-
gers-merely a quick capable motion with
no lost movement

  none o that shack snarled hand
me somepin pay your-

  ill hand you a bat in the teeth the
kid said quietly he did not move from
his easeful position his two arms still vd
against the wall of the car he spoke the
words calmly yet with full meaning no
mistaking his meaning

  thats what ill hand you he added
after a pause

  shack spluttered futilely 

  go on away and leave us alone the
kid turned his back to the man leaned
against the steel sides of the car watched
the flitting landscape towhead stood
eager nervous ready to leap should the
occasion come but it did not come after
an instant of wavering the brakeman turned
away cursed heavily climbed from the
pipe-car to the ladder of the box-car in
front looked down from his perch snarled
and disappeared

  well thats that towhead murmured
and smiled in relief

  yes thats that dake the big man
agreed

  silently watchful through this the others
now awakened to life rising jeers fol-
low the brakeman menacing eyes glared
after him

  wonder how much he got narrow-
chest questioned

  moren two dollars structural steel
volunteered i watched him as he tuk it

  aw gawd i ony hope i meet that
bird out alone some dark night nar-
row-chest was a vindictive creature aw
gawd i hope i meet that guy out alone
ill take that knife away from him an rip
his guts out with it thats what ill do

  a ripple of laughter swept the men
one called swede scoffed

  thats nothin waitll youve been
on the roads longs me ive had em
take razors an knives an buttonhooks a
shack on the damned s p took the button-
hook one time an i had a hell of a time
keepin my shoes on all one morning till
i bummed another pair o dog-houses that
laced up

  its cheap at that another averred

  sure it is take the u p now its

the blue

a hard road to ride id rather pay a little
fare like this than git croaked wit a
blackjack

  sure any guy would

  the train was slowing up the seven-
teen dropped from the pipe-car joining
other wanderers who dropped from other
cars until half a hundred men shuffled
along the right-of-way toward the water-
tank at the first north-and-south road
stopping to read a sign that gave direc-
tions the group split several looked
thoughtfully over the thin array of houses
that dotted the crossroads visions of pos-
sible breakfasts were in their eyes

chapter ii

comewhat after this fashion had
passed four years of the florida kids
life nearly seven hundred more or less
colorful days had been spent in france
where he was sergeant carlton days that
had been somewhat as the meat in a sand-
wich and as the spices on the meat but
on both the top and bottom layers of this
scope of years were the months of wan-
dering those of his friends and neigh-
bors who four years and more before had
known thomas noyes carlton in hilltop
florida would have never recognized in
him the hobo who faced down the brake-
man on that morning as the indiana town
was approached

  in hilltop-so named because at high
tide the gallery of the largest house is
twenty-nine feet above sea-level-the flor-
ida kid was daddy carlton to a small
circle of friends made up almost exclusively
of the male sex and even more exclusively
of those men who came from inland cities
to lure from the blue and green waters
the battling tarpon the gamey sea-trout
the blackfish the redfish and other mem-
bers of the finny tribe daddy he was
called and the term was in recognition of
the young mans quiet demeanor his self-
effacement his habit of slow sparse speech
in the opinion of this small circle of friends
he was aged greatly beyond his years he
was one who pored over books who
dreamed daydreams who gave his idle
hours to the perfection of new tackle-
lighter and more efficient which neverthe-
less gave the fish a greater chance against
the fisherman one who studiously sought
out new fishing-grounds for the men who
hired him with his boat the pensacola gal

  forsaking the water for a brief season
he had entered the service of hillson
brothers who kept the general store this
was during one july august and septem-
ber when the green-flies swarmed and when
the storms threatening kept away the
fishing men after that brief trial twelve
to fourteen hours a day back of the coun-
ters daddy carlton definitely decided that
a life of mercantile endeavor was not to
be in his scheme of things and he went
back to his boats his tackle his books and
to the further accumulation of wisdom
that made him the best boatman on the
sound

writer had come to the florida coast
to study for the book he then was writing

hilltop this was when thomas noyes

tember when the boy was eight a gale
upset the boat that carried his father
two miles out in the gulf the body was
washed ashore with the next incoming tide
washed to the long white bar that divided
mainland from gulf and was buried close
to the fathers beloved mounds

  with the small resources at her com-
mand the widow chose to remain in the
village first of reasons for this was that
there a family of two could live comfortably
on ten dollars a week the second was that
she was convinced the community was a
clean one in which to rear her son

  at the age of thirteen the boy was within
three-fifths of a second of the worlds
record in one or two swimming events at
fourteen he had perfected two minnows a
sinker and a floater that on four-foot cast-
ing rods were supreme lures to the speckled
trout at fifteen he was credited with being
one of the most knowing boatmen on the
sound which covered a distance of about
thirty miles east and west by several miles
north and south

  with the aid of his spring and summer
earnings from the gal he contrived to enter
the high school in pensacola on each
saturday and sunday and in the short
vacations he added to these earnings

  so the years went on-dreamy quiet
years without the spur of actual necessity
dreamy quiet days on the broad waters of
cholococo bay dreamy quiet nights when
his boat anchored at the mouth of the bay
above the pile of bricks that marked the
place where a barge had sunk he watched

and aided while some city fisherman landed
his catch dreamy quiet hours when it
rained and when he read or worked over
the boats pulled up in a shed

  it was in his seventeenth year that his
mother was laid away at the side of his
father following that the son grew into
greater quietness continued his senior term
in high school finished the year and kept
the house with its acre of earth exactly as
his mother had kept it

a s thomas noyes grew out of his youth
 thoughts of the future years began to
beat into the quiet hours men from the
north and from the cities of alabama
tennessee georgia mississippi came
down to fish became his regular custom-
ers and grew fond of the boy yet they
brought freely of the discontent the world
had brought to them many began to offer
freely of their advice undoubtedly very
sincere in the belief that he was wasting
his time in this place and spoke largely
of a young mans opportunities hinting of
the marvelous fortunes that awaited in the
world outside to the boy who was content
and happy the boy who knew real happi-
ness not the vagrant pleasure that with so
many passes for the genuine

  dimly he began to envision this outside
world as it was arrayed in the newspapers
he read idly at first he began to picture
it as the place where men fought steadily
fought against everything and for any-
thing vaguely after a little time he began
to arrive at the conclusion that adventure
lay in this great outside space adventure to
be sought confronted and overcome
through which deeds one must win to great
reward these men from the outside were
right nothing ever happened in hilltop
the maze of days was an endless stream of
the commonplace the alarms and adven-
tures the wealth and power the position
and tense moments that all this strange-
ness brought with it must be sought out-
side the place where he was happiest the
place where he believed he most truly
fitted

  an old doctor retired after many hard
years brought most of this discontent and
brought it unknowingly-though some of
it also came from-books for youth pos-
sesses the power to live in the scenes of
the pages but the doctor furnished most
of the argument against the way of life
on the sound furnished it unknowingly
and by force of contrast
the florida kid

  nearly blind i was the doctor would
explain time upon time he seemed to
like to dwell on his rise in the world he
was born in england and a long residence
in the united states had not dissipated a
slight accent thomas noyes knew his
voice as agreeable and appreciated the
half-confidences it brought

  studied until i was nearly blind the
doctor would go on came to the united
states and was about broke when i hit
the land punched cattle-was an officer
got back my sight came down here and
married different people then-not the
chances you have now youve got to go
out and get it though-got to fight for it
it wont come to you holed up here month
after month youve got to go after it
any man can get rich if he goes out to
get it

  any man the boy would inquire for
already he had the delving mind arent
some men peculiarly fitted to get wealth
while others are not so fitted

  bunk its what you go after you
get the thing you drive for

pame discontent to thomas noyes
 came the time when the people of
hilltop for whom he had cared greatly
and had respected fully began to appear
as futile aimless drifting came the time
when the great pull to go out and battle
and win began to strive against his love for
the water for his books for the quiet hours
it was a time of disturbance discontent
striving with content the unknown laugh-
ing at and deriding the known

  came the increasing discontent when he
began to look upon himself as an idler in
a life that called to men of deeds came
the quickening belief that he had but to go
forth grasp cling to and win came the
poring over the literature of discontent the
books and magazines that feature the great
success the absorbing tales of success that
must come that would come irrespective
of the capabilities brain liking power
mental or physical fitness for the end
sought

  anything is possible that is gone after
one has but to go forth determine seek
the goal and receive the reward stick-to-
it-iveness-guts determination spine will
all became heavily exclamatory virtues
that spelled success one had but to ad-
vance stick to it determine and win the
recipe was simple

  and simple it appeared to thomas

the blue

noyes in his questioning time except for
the questions what if one desires not
a success of the sort set forth in the books
what if one asked for but happiness a
quiet life doing that which appealed as
best to that person irrespective whether
the doing made for the greatest efficiency
or merely had to do with heart-pulling
urges just happiness whether in over-
alls broadcloth cottage or mansion with
a bank-account or without a bank-account
just happiness-pure plain unworrying
happiness not pleasure not the evanes-
cent element that comes for an instant like
the taste of a sweet and is followed by the
indigestion of discontent not this but
happiness the joy of a well-fed way of life
it was little to ask he believed yet the
world cared not for those that asked little
he reminded himself the world was wait-
ing for those that fought and won fail-
ure there was no failure when one was
girded with the armor of determination
spine and guts

  but thomas noyes objected in an
hour when the doctor had been especially
emphatic dont you believe that many of
these others these failures are as happy
as those whose success stories we hear
these people in hilltop-take jim plum-
mer who fishes and carries the mail and
who has been to pensacola but three times
in two years how would you line out jim
he has his house his boats a little educa-
tion and three or four children hes a
dead one perfectly contented with every-
thing doesnt worry about anything but
isnt he happy thats the big question
that comes to me do the jim plummers
-and i may be one of them-ask that-
dont let yourself get that idea the
doctor interrupted i reckon the jim
plummers are content as you call it but
are they valuable to life

  i dont know the youth worried
jims a producer in a way he does his
little bit for life not much but as much
as hes capable-

  thats the thought what would he
have been capable of doing had he put
himself in the way of being capable
what might he have done how rich
powerful might he have become thus
the fertilizing of the germ of discontent
hes fossilized why boy it must be
torture for you to think of passing your
life in this sort of way you cant even
think of it get out find out what you
can do give your capabilities their op-
book magazine



portunity you owe it to yourself-to
your nation every man must be a pro-
ducer to his greatest ability get the
idea

  yes-sto his greatest ability

dy little and little the questions fell away
until overborne by this urge from the
outside and by the new mysterious call
from within his course became suddenly
quite plain he called david higgins into
the yard of the home place and pointed to
the house

  pay the rent to hillson carlton told
him im going outside hillson will keep
up the taxes and repairs hillson brothers
were by way of being bankers to the little
community im going to look around
come here he led the way to various
places in the yard keep these roses as
they are he indicated trim this vine
as its now trimmed keep this walk from
the house to the mounds free from weeds
put some shells on it when it needs them
understand

  higgins nodded he had known carl-
tons mother and felt the unspoken rea-
sons back of the careful requests

  whenll you be back he asked

  i dont know when i- take care
of my books the gal should be calked
that green skiff needs a new painter if
you run short of ready money and a big
repair is necessary see john hillson ill
arrange that well settle when i come
back

  carlton left hilltop that night

  he was then nearing his twentieth year
a man in stature a quiet plodding think-
ing man who felt he had in some way
missed his boyhood he believed he now
was seeking it to be followed by a suc-
cessful resounding manhood

pame the intermittent labor that falls to
 the lot of the wanderer the labor that
somehow kept his body together came
the war and thomas noyes then in the
state of new york felt the call to arms
it promised new adventure and he was
not disappointed came the days in
france and afterward the wandering again
but success the quick battles and great re-
wards of his dreams came not he be-
came the itinerant workman a capable
workman while he labored but one af-
flicted with the germ of unrest who felt
that he was pursuing false calls or no calls
at all he was afloat strange places

by charles horn

new scenes harbors without anchor and
the spacious pastures over the next hill
filled the days of his quest success-he
had never even glimpsed it

  and now credulity would have reached
the breaking-point had these quiet people
of hilltop seen the quiet plodding boy
who had left them become this hobo who
battled with and for the other road-rats--
who mooched his chuck with the other
stiffs of the long road who rode trains
without the formality of buying tickets on
decks blinds bumpers and rods-who had
made four complete circuits of the country
lakes to gulf and coast to coast who
knew the secrets of many jungles the de-
sirability of innumerable flops and the
insides of a dozen jails and lockups-who
was in fine a dyed-in-the-wool stiff an
itinerant workman one of the countrys
average crop of half-million hoboes to
the people of hilltop all this would have
verged on the impossible

  yet they would have found thomas
noyes carlton in some ways the same
though in others greatly changed the
one-time gravity had been polished to a
needle sharpness refined in the unceasing
contact with the diamond-hard surface of
the world the tall stoop-shouldered frame
had knitted into a body wide of shoulder
and deep of chest the red hair was darker
and usually now more tousled the calm
gray eyes had become cold gray eyes un-
wavering weighing merciless at times
the nerve that had sometimes questioned
in the hilltop days now hesitated at no
normal or abnormal hazard in the wander-
ers life from the quiet studious boy of
twenty had evolved the quiet hard-boiled
man of twenty-five-a leader of hoboes
fully accepted by them and worshiped by
one at least the boy dake

  in all this change was also an exchange
of a sort for every element taken by life
from thomas noyes another element had
been given to the florida kid for clean-
liness had come disorder for content dis-
content for timidity had come hard nerve
for innocence of a sort wisdom of the
deepest for a steady belief a steady dis-
belief when the world takes it also
gives it is a way of the world

  out of this boiling mess was coming
however a resolve born of a belief a re-
straining thought that was a dressing to
the kids salad of life the ingredients of
this salad were unknown to him but this
he did know he was drifting the drifting
the florida kid

took him nowhere the success that had
been painted and held up to him-where
was success

  the kid was questioning as he roamed

chapter iii

i inceasing change marked the months
of wandering change that brought the
men nothing to further their lives change
that grew wearisome in its very monotony
of variety they knew to a daily cer-
tainty that they would awaken to the ob-
scenity of the jungle-up breakfast or to
the stench of the flop-house the day
would be passed they knew largely in
evading the eyes of the law or the eyes of
those that passed looking askance on the
hoboes they knew that night would draw
near to compel again the dirt of another
flop-house or the terrible chill of the out-
doors or the muck of some shed or out-
building stench always stench and
they called this adventure at times
these wanderers worked perhaps a day a
week a month then on again at the call
of the itching foot always they were
pariahs outcasts objects beyond the law
lawless by very truth of their wandering
mothers frightened children with the
words ill give you to the tramps of-
ficers cursed them on beat them on
prodded them on--always on always on

  unceasing change peculiar happenings
but all tinged with the unclean the de-
structive the unavailing

hthe kid sat at his campfire in a

	jungle beside a railroad-track singe-
ing strips of bologna held in the flames
on the end of a pointed stick and tending
a can of coffee that boiled in the hot ashes
dake at his side also had the pointed
stick and the bologna it was the day on
which the kid had met dake at fifth and
vine streets near the fountain following
an afternoon of rambling over the city
hastily turning corners when a uniformed
man or plain-clothes dick drew near-
the wanderer acquires an instinct that
recognizes all men of the law--they had
turned their steps to the railroad now
they sat at their meat

  from a second fire five or six feet away
came the voice of an aged wanderer both
dake and the kid as their foreheads fried
in the heat listened to this voice

  some old-timer eh dake grinned

the blue



  half a dozen boys ringed the old-timers
fire hearkening to his words receiving in-
structions in the art of begging old-tim-
ers speech was that of a man from the
isles perhaps with a burr over the rs
it is impossible to reconstruct it with type

  theres always places in every town
he was saying thats good for battering
nuns houses and those places where youll
find the fathers and preachers homes of
the workingmen and the like now sup-
posing you was battering a tenement
house-he called it tinnimint ouse-
how would you go at it

  a period of thought then from one
lad

  well id go in knock on a door and
give em a good spiel

  which door old-timer insisted

  the first one i hit i blieve in tak-
in-

  old-timer snorted in great disgust

  sure you would youd gallop in bat-
ter a door and get nothing heres the
way to work it go to the top floor and
work down they cant see you coming
then never start at the bottom never
work the first door you see if you do
when you knock every woman in the dump
will poke her head over the railing and say
to herself its one of them darn tramps
and when you reach her door she wont be to
home go to the top and work down
keep that in mind they cant see you
coming theyll think youre a friend come
for a visit

  while this bit of wisdom was soaking in
the group was silent old-timer continued
about flops work the light plants
theyre warm and the night man may let
you sleep over the boilers in most towns
you can find flop-houses where theyll bed
you down for a jitney or two theres the
station-houses too where theyll let you
sleep at times but the hell of them is
that there may be city drunks in them
and you cant sleep watch out for
horstile towns talk with the lads on the
road theyll wise you up

  dont go to looking for signs on fences
and water-tanks thatll tell you where to
batter thats all bunk there may be
mobs of yeggs that has such signs but
ive been on the road for twenty-three
years and im damned if i know anything
about em

  old-timer poked a stick into the fire ad-
justed the can in which coffee was boiling
laboriously stretched his creaking joints
book magazine

  let me tell you about places to batter
he offered dont go into the swell resi-
dence part except in very little towns
dont go into the places that is all new
keep away from the houses that is trimmed
up with vines and has a little dbg running
around after his tail in the back yard and
a fancy thing to hang clothes on keep
away the people that lives in them
houses is paying for them by the month
and whatever they have left over the dog
gets it

  go down to the other part of town
where the old woman is washing in the
back yard where theres six or seven kids
around her shell cuss you but shell
feed you

  he lifted an impressive forefinger coated
with grime

  now get this ive been hitting the
road for twenty-three years and i know my
stuff get this i work sometimes in the
winter when i cant get to the coast or
new orleans and get this i know my
stuff

  he went on with his instructing dake
grinned across at the kid

  ill say he knows his stuff eh a real
old bundle stiff i guess there aint many
of them left

  a note of admiration was in dakes
words

  nodding slowly thoughtfully the kid
made no answer squatting before his fire
narrowly watching old-timer a hint of
question crept into the kids eyes this
old bundle stiff-of which few were left-
who spread his teaching of beggary and
idleness to the willing circle of boys was
there in this old stiff the picture of what
he the kid was to be in the years to
come would he too sit in a jungle his
body covered with lice and rags filthy with
the scales of uncleanliness would he too
sit beside a beggars fire in some far-
distant vista down the years and out of
his experience proclaim the teachings of
the parasite was this to be his portion
of life was he through his actions of
today preparing this condition for the mor-
row

  somehow in the weeks that had dipped
themselves into the near past these and
other similar questions had beaten at the
kid

i abor day in charleston west vir-
ginia the kid and dake with three
other wanderers had been chased off an

by charles horn

east-bound train on the c  o in the
early hours of the morning and were forced
to drop off in south charleston they
were on their way to the coast intending
to work down into the warmer states for
the winter daylight crept above the
mountains as the five men crouched above
a tiny fire

  ever made this place before one
asked

  dake gave answer yeah towns
over there he pointed to the north
across a long bridge theres a jungle
over there along the k  m

  seeking breakfast with the coming of
daylight the five paid their tolls and
crossed the long bridge dake by virtue
of his superior knowledge of the possibili-
ties of the city became leader

  well batter the west side he directed
its across another bridge lots of work-
ingmen over there and the mooching should
be good

  breakfast supplied by the residents of
the district on the west side of elk river
the five men loafed in the jungles until
nearly noon the three strangers then an-
nounced their intention to turn back on
their journey going north on the k  m

  too much mine war down here they
said a guy dont know when hes goin
to get bumped off or have something hung
on him nobody gives a damn for a hobo
anyhow were goin to take the b  o
an go over that way

watching them depart dake and the
 kid found no pangs in the leavetak-
ing the five had met in cincinnati on the
noon of the previous day and had traveled
together merely because it was easier than
avoiding each other

  calls of hunger making themselves felt
again after the three men had left the kid
and dake started out to batter the resi-
dence stem	

  it was a day of rest for the workingmen
each front porch holding its quota of oc-
cupants the wife sewing or reading the
husband with his feet on the railing smok-
ing idling with practiced eye dake
looked over the houses in one block

  that green one over there he decided
at last the kid nodded in agreement

  now in the eyes of dake there lurked
an appealing light a humorous mark of
fellowship that he had found went well
with the women of the houses for this
reason equipped with the better artillery
the florida kid



for the attack dake had willingly taken
upon himself the getting of food he now
advanced his slender body held carefully
erect his battered cap in one hand his
eyes smiling upon the fat woman who
rocked on the porch of the green house
the kid waited at the gate

  madam dake began were two boys
thats down here hunting work and we
cant find it till tomorrow we have had
nothing to eat since yesterday morning
we dont like to moo-beg our meals but
were hungry thats all there is to it
he finished earnestly were hungry as
dogs

  it was the pearl of an appeal backed as
it was by dakes appearance his frank
countenance it should have caused the
veriest dyspeptic to look upon the world
with happier eyes but it made no ap-
parent impression upon the woman-or on
her man who went calmly on with his
reading

  i aint got a thing she said firmly

 madam dake continued you
wouldnt turn away two hungry men i
know you wouldnt you aint that-

  i aint got a thing she reiterated this
time more forcefully

  madam aint you even got a piece of
bread and meat

  not a thing i told you her body
straightened aggressively her man went
on with his reading

  not even a piece of bread dakes
voice was heavied with misery just a
piece of dry bread even

  ive told you for the last time she
snapped that i aint got nothing now
get out

  dakes head waggled sorrowfully his
tongue clicked in commiseration how-
ever his active thoughts were weighing
the means of his sudden flight that would
be certain to follow upon his next words

  madam he said gravely youre
worse off than i thought ts-ts-ts ill
get out but i want to make this offer im
the best little moocher in the world and
if youll just give me a big basket ill go
out and get you more chuck than youve
seen in a month

  dake was halfway to the front gate when
the sound of the heavy laughter of the man
on the porch halted him the youngster
turned wonderingly neighbors craned
their necks to ascertain the cause of the
mans uncontrollable mirth

 kate the workman roared his

the blue

command to his wife thats too good
come on in boy you eat here come
on in  he called to the kid your buddy
has won you a meal 

  and as dake would have said that was
that

nthus it went the unknown mingling
with the unexpected always the unex-
pected in one instant danger that leaped
into laughter into horseplay into tears
into flight into the edge-places of crime
and on and on and on always the unex-
pected and that had been a part of the
lure at first but there had come the
knowledge of unprofitable days days that
reached no goal never the opportunity to
hesitate to weigh plan lay lines for the
future naught but change change change
that led nowhere unceasingly running in
circles that beat back upon each other and
carried down to old age down to poverty
beggary-down to what what

  to what did it lead where were the
years going to what advantage were the
kid and dake spending their wealth of
days and youth the months that were their
portion of riches

  these were the questions that were com-
ing to the kid

chapter iv

collowed weeks of aimless wandering

	weeks in which questions of the future
were forgotten after the trip into florida
failed to materialize wanderers met in a
junction near baltimore told of terrific liv-
ing- and labor-conditions in the states of
the south a drive was on against hoboes
florida was gathering them in and shipping
them to the turpentine camps alabama
was working them on roads georgia also
believed road work should be the drifters
portions

  with these conditions reported dake
and the kid turned back and with the loss
of objective it seemed that all definiteness
had mysteriously vanished the two young-
sters merely fell into the current figura-
tively turned their backs and allowed the
winds of chance to carry them about
once in a futile way the kid mentioned
this to dake

  this is getting us nowhere he said
breaking into a long silence

  eh what dake came out of a
half-doze they were in central tennessee
book magazine



by charles horn

and it was extremely warm fall weather
both men were stretched in the shade of a
haystack dakes arms were locked be-
neath his head his eyes were closed
whats getting us nowhere he asked
this roaming about

  whats wrong with it

  everything cant you see-feel the
changing of yourself last night for in-
stance you were attracted to that bunch of
wobblies youve sneered at them before
now youre falling for their bunk

  oh they aint so bad dake believed
theres some good fellows with them
theyre-

  fellows like yourself the kid said
seriously theyve fallen for the bunk-
organized idleness the i w w bunch
are getting at the wrong end of the handle
-the hot end sixty per cent of them
wouldnt work if they got the opportunity
thirty per cent are radicals that have been
thrown out of other organizations ten per
cent are just plain fools they are creat-
ing-

  well dake said with a grin you get
us a job of work that well both like and
ill stay on it till the devil skates on hell
whats the matter with you anyhow
nothing except ive been wondering
what were drifting to-what well be ten
years from now

  you go a long way into the future to
find your trouble dake grunted forget
it when we get ready to stop well stop
well stick some place and get married and
raise us a family then everythingll be
jake this is pretty soft right now i
think

  were wasting the kid mused were
cheating-

  aw what do you want to do get a
job on a sewer-gang or down in some coal-
mine or on the streets think thatd lay
up shekels for the old age thats the
work we hoboes capture-the stuff the
home boy wont do thats our speed
dake turned over shielding his face
from the creeping sun youre a funny
bird he added and grinned

  the kid made no reply and it was this
that he was beginning to feel-that it was
becoming increasingly hard to carry his end
of the argument or even the thoughts that
had risen so valiantly within him before
by little and little he found himself falling
into the grooves of thought of the other
drifters he met in his wanderings once or
twice to his unmeasured surprise he found

himself even railing at the fates that
seemed to surround him tie him oppress
him he knew these arguments were all fal-
lacious but where before he had laughed
or sneered at the mouthy ravings of the
malcontents he was beginning to find him-
self agreeing with them

  and this frightened him when he al-
lowed himself to think of it

thus the kid and dake drifted through
the states dake felt no fear of the
future dake dreamed no dreams dake
knew no impulses beyond those of the flesh
daily one day he explained something of
his condition and aspirations

  im doing just the thing ive always
wanted to do he said when i was at
home in harristown pennsy my old man
beat hell out of me every day as long as i
can remember on sunday he fought me
to sunday-school-i think id have liked
the old testament lessons if he hadnt
pounded them into me i hated sunday-
school im not very good at figures and
he tried to teach them to me by beating
me

  i always said i was going to have a
good time when i got old enough to be
my own boss he continued and im do-
ing it im just having the time of my life
now im not giving one damn what hap-
pens ever feel that way

  sometimes the kid acknowledged

  i guess you had a better time than i
did dake mused thats why this hobo
stuff dont set so well with you

  the two drifted on passing through a
hundred cities and hamlets slinking
through them watchful for the eyes of
authority growing increasingly careless as
the weather increased its chill of their per-
sonal and bodily appearance in the warm
months it was no trick to shave beside a
stream or even to dip ones body into the
water and to wash ones garments after a
fashion but with the approach of winter
this changed working during a week in
kentucky the two men found themselves
possessed of money sufficient to purchase
extra shirts which they donned over two
other shirts and extra trousers slipped on
over overalls they began to assume a
choked bundled appearance they found
they must exert unusual agility in catching
the trains hampered as they were with the
multiplicity of garments

  and it seemed that the chill of coming
winter congealed the spark of ambition
the florida kid



the blue

that had burned in the kid in the summer
and fall months rapidly and more rap-
idly he allowed himself to accept each hour
as it came with increasing ease he slept
through the days after filling his stomach
at the back door of some house and he
rose with the sunset prepared to catch a
train that would carry him somewhere-
somewhere

  dake and the kid came to a middle
western state it was a dismal day a
steady rain falling and chill winds cut-
ting november in a box-car in which
the two men were passing the daylight
hours the kid came upon a week-old news-
paper and after reading it he sat long in
silence gazing out the opened car door
watching a light wagon drawn by a pair of
mules drag through the mud of the road
that bordered the tracks

  well ride into town tonight he said
at last and a trace of jubilance was in his
tones well ride north

  north dake objected well freeze
to death wed better keep on down
through oklahoma and texas as we laid
out to do

  no its north about fifty miles were
you in the war buddy

  seven months in a training-camp lim-
ited service i got a bum left eye

  this is a gathering of the boys in the
city well make the kid explained it
starts tomorrow this paper says this is
sunday isnt it

  sunday no wednesday

  youre crazy this is sunday
mebbe it is a guy cant keep the
days rambling

  theres a gathering-a convention
well make it therell be times there
oh well dake agreed if thats it
well make it

this was one of the advantages of the

	wandering life the kid exulted destina-
tion could be changed at will no strings
hampered no burdens obligated no tasks
chafed merely it was a matter of deci-
sion the kid grinned as this thought
came with dakes easy acquiescence and
the grin lifted into a light that warmed his
body as he also thought of the gathering
he was determined to attend

  for a week he exulted he would not be
the kid a wanderer but he would be a
personality-he would be sergeant carlton
of the st-devil carlton should he
meet any of his old buddies undoubtedly

he would meet them and there would be
days of jollification that would bring back
the days of france all the hell of them
with the lure of them man-talk thered
be light music laughter for seven days
he would walk again in a mans clean
image

  speculatively he glanced down at the
jeans trousers that clad his lower body and
at the grease-marked rumpled coat that
covered his shoulders his fingers touched
the four-day growth of whiskers on his chin
and cheek for months after coming from
france he had managed to shave each
day then he had skipped a day gradually
he fell into the habit of allowing seven days
to pass he knew this to be a breaking of
his mental fiber but it gave him no active
concern a weeks growth of beard he
knew was not as serious as a weeks prop-
agation of lice on his body and this prop-
agation was present and active

  now in the seven days to come he
would be sergeant carlton he would find
a uniform-his chevrons and the shoulder
insignia of his division were safe in his
pocket with his discharge papers

  while he was seated in the car on a
rain-soaked sidetrack waiting for the whis-
tling of a night train he mused over the
possibilities-wondered if he would see or
meet women at the gathering he was deter-
mined to attend wondered if they would be
as gracious as those of his training-camp
days

  remembrance of the old days and
nights coming back he felt himself filling
with a sudden hunger for womens society
and as he crouched in the door of the car
just without the circle of rain a girl came
into view picking her path along the
muddy crossing a hundred feet away at
first as the kid watched her he thought
her outrageously fat but as she went slowly
from island to island in the sea of mud
he began to believe she bore some measure
of attraction

  watching her he wondered if her lips
were hot as that girls in brest had been
hot the long-waisted girl in brest he
wondered whether this plump girl-she
had gone from outrageously fat merely to
plump now-would close her eyes when
kissed her head relaxing drawing the
mans head back with hers forcing his lips
to follow her lips

  unheeding of the eyes that watched her
the girl negotiated the crossing and went
stolidly on her way as she passed out of
book magazine

sight the kid breathed deeply a breath
heavy with pent emotion and leaped to
his feet

  lets get out of this he snarled
lets give this town the once-over

  out in this rain dake moaned
sure out in this rain out anywhere
youre a funny bird dake gave opin-
ion well be pinched sure

  no we wont they dont pinch ex-serv-
ice men who are on their way to a con-
vention of the buddies got your discharge
papers

  ill say so i keep them

  lets go then were all right

chapter v

transportation was obtained that
 night by virtue of the discharge papers
climbing aboard a through freight that had
stopped at the tank dake and the kid
dodged between two cars and clambered to
the bumpers a brakeman saw them and
approached silently quickly flashing his
lantern upon them

  get the hell offa this he snarled
beat it

  listen cap the kid said quickly
let us ride tonight we want to get to
the city we want to make that conven-
tion we havent seen any of the boys
since we came back and-

  you over the shack asked eying
them narrowly

  i was the kid explained my buddy
was hooked up in a training-camp-limited
service weve-

  dont hang on outside then the shack
snapped get back to the caboose the
cons all right he had a boy over there
duck now grab the front end of the dog-
house when she starts out

  dake and the kid obeyed

  the brakeman sat in the caboose with
them when the train was under way

  my names kelly he said i was
over with a machine-gun company

  he looked up from the discharge papers
dake and the kid had given him

  a sergeant eh he said and there
was a measure of new respect in his voice
gee youre a lucky bird in some ways
id rather be a sergeant than colonel its
a sign you probably have more guts first-
class private was best i got

  as they whistled for the yards kelly
sprang to his feet

by charles horn



  listen he said reaching for the lan-
tern you go up to the yard office when 
we pull in wait for me i live at the
other end of my run but i got a room
here got any jack

  dake nodded fourteen dollars the
kid replied

  were settin pretty kelly observed
ill see you at the yard office tell em
youre waiting for kelly if they ask-and
that you came with the other boys thatll
make it all right this burg belongs to
us guys for the second time in our lives-
this week and when we left for camp ive
got me a four-day layoff and im going out
among em wait for me

  this kelly was a dynamic individual
his words were shot from hard jaws and
battered on the ears of listeners his body
continually was in action he seemed built
on springs the kid more deliberate in
action and speech watched with a grin as
the brakeman jumped for the door tore it
open and aided by the motion of the train
slammed it back of him dake sighed
some good boy that bird he said
hes all right bet he had a good time
in the war

  dake laughed hes all right though
he insisted

  sure he is the kid agreed bet he
ran after every shell as it blew up to see
what made it go hes great

  ill say he is well stick with him

  we will that i need some one to
show me this village

  there was a quality in the last words
that brought dakes head around he
looked the kid over speculatively

  hell dake breathed well sure
take the lid off of this old town

  watch me the kid promised

  now me dake went on after a little
pause i want whisky-real whisky im
going to get drunk-for once in my life im
going to get drunk as a dog and ill be
sure i wont get snagged for thirty or sixty
days for it and im-

  better lay off that stuff the kid ad-
vised

  it aint as bad as wild women dake
defended his appetites i love booze

  the kid shook his head slowly no
virtue in me keeping away from it he
acknowledged just that i dont care for
the taste of it i get sick before i get
drunk and i dont like to get sick thats
all there is to keeping sober with me if
i liked it i reckon id drink it

  save your share for me dake grinned

  kellys sharp voice cut into the words
the train was slowing up the whistle cut-
ting the air in short blasts they had
reached a crossing

  snap out of it you guys kelly
barked drop off here the yard office
is over there where you see those lights
he leaned to the window and pointed out
the glow that spread itself upon the wet
pane wait for me and he was gone-
eyes arms body voice moving

  he barks like a first sergeant dake
laughed as they picked their way to the
yard office entered and sat at one side on
a long bench

tn half an hour kelly hurried in looked

	about and beckoned to them

  lets go lets get this next car up-
town

  he was out striding on ahead dake
and the kid followed him over a network
of tracks up a flight of iron steps and on
to a viaduct kelly ran forward flagging
a car that approached and calling back to
the two men the three climbed aboard
and the car labored and whined up a long
hill

  here we are kelly called again after
five minutes had passed this is our cor-
ner

  outside the rain had changed to a
drizzle kelly and his charges stood upon
a corner as the car toiled up the hill and
watched the crowds that milled about
them khaki was everywhere hilarity was
heavy on the night voices were lifting
or quavering or croaking in song as the
vocal endowment of the singer made pos-
sible khaki-clad forms passed in twos and
threes in groups and singly and everyone
of these was attempting to lift his voice
above his neighbors

  looks like the night in france when
the armistice was signed the kid said

  sure does dont it kelly agreed
come on you guys lets go and get
cleaned up then well get out and
mingle

  following kelly into the furnished room
that was his stopping place at the western
end of his run the kid bethought himself
of the acquisition of uniforms for dake and
himself there was absolutely no chance
for a fellow he mused unless that fellow
covered his frame with khaki and then
every opportunity would fall at that fel-
lows feet no possibility there seemed

either of begging borrowing or stealing a
suit of tan every garment in the possession
of anyone already clothed some figure no
chance there was-but hold the trinity
of possibilities of possession brought the
inkling of an idea perhaps the uniforms
could not be begged or borrowed but about
this third possibility this bore the glim-
mer of a hope

  talking volubly ceaselessly arms thresh-
ing over his head as he bent above the
washbowl in his bathroom soapsuds bub-
bling from his mouth in his eagerness for
speech kelly filled his little room with
sound the kid paced the floor looking
thoughtfully into the street below at times
in his pacing he halted at the window
watching those tan-clad men who traveled
in pairs or singly the plan held possibil-
ities he turned to kelly

  will you wait here for me he asked
hurriedly half-hour

  whats the idea

  ive got to get our uniforms i know
a guy down the street that has two suits
hes-hes one of my pals i wont-
waitll i dress well go with you
kelly offered

  i can get them while youre dressing
save time

  he hurried away

as they had stepped from the car the
lines of a tall fence had caught his eye
and he was now making for it it had had
all the appearance of the fence surrounding
a junkyard and seemed to offer ideal con-
ditions to his mission men had passed be-
fore it men clad in khaki the lights
about it were scattered throwing great
stretches of the fence in deep shadow that
would be the place he decided for the
acquiring of two suits he moved away

  and then above him a sign caught his
attention and brought another inspiration
the sign told of furnished lodgings the
building before which it swayed was tall
and old and weatherbeaten the very place
that should house a number of men a
hag of a woman answered the finger he
placed on the bell-button and looked him
over critically

  im here at this convention he told
her my uniform is being pressed i
want a place to sleep how are your
rooms filled

  she grunted ive got everything ex-
cept two rooms filled with you fellers you
can have one of them
book magazine

by charles horn

  good im glad the boys are sleeping
here he said striving for a rustic sim-
plicity how many with you

  oh about forty she growled i got
one vacant room its four bits in ad-
vance baggage or no baggage

  the kid laughed joyously

  the kid exulted in the line-up of affairs
things were shaping themselves better than
he had dared hope forty men more or
less asleep forty men would certainly
mean a considerable number of unlocked
doors he would be out of the place
well within the half-hour he believed

  and he was there was no interruption
to his search the first room into which
he crept held two occupants he determined
that by the split volume and syncopation
of their snores-and this room yielded a
suit of tan that would the kid believed
conveniently cover dakes body carrying
it away after carefully going through the
pockets and leaving their contents on a
chair by the sleepers bed the kid pressed
a harkening ear to the crack of his door
before venturing forth to accumulate an-
other suit that would fit his own frame

  this time after trying five doors and
finding them locked he entered the sixth
room stood in darkness long enough to ac-
custom his eyes to the objects faintly visi-
ble in the light that filtered from the street
and harkened to the snores they came
regular though subdued creeping to the
bed the kid saw the dim bulk of clothing
piled upon a chair lifted the breeches he
found held them against his waist and
beheld in them a miraculous affinity

  quickly going through the pockets he
found a great roll of bills secured with an
elastic band a handful of silver was in a
hip pocket of the breeches a watch ticked
in the pocket under the belt these he
laid carefully upon the chair together with
a notebook found in the blouse and with
the garments tucked under his arm and the
cap perched jauntily upon one side of his
head he peered through the crack of the
door all was clear he slipped back to
his room

etasy money he exulted it was duck-
soup stripping off his battered cloth-
ing he slipped arms and legs into the
khaki leaning over to put on the leggings
a symbol oi the sleeve of the blouse
caught his eye twisting about he in-
spected it in the light from the street and
found a sergeants chevrons

  rolling his body on the bed muffling his
laughter he wondered why god had been
so good to him

  three minutes later he opened the door
of the sergeants room poked inside the
bundle of soiled clothing and closed the
door five minutes later he was again in
the street the suit for dake carefully
folded carried under one arm

  outside he had a qualm he wished it
might be possible to carry dakes outfit
back to the first room he had frisked-it
was rough on a guy the kid felt to deprive
him of all clothing except his underwear
and in november too it might be after
dake had changed a way could be found
to furnish that first guy with a change of
clothing

  as he hurried back to kellys room the
kid determined there would be a way he
wouldnt act like a dog with a buddy who
was in town for a good time

chapter vi

in the after years when the kid remem-
 bered the movements of that night the
picture outstanding above all others was
that of the bath not that it was a
bath strange in any way except perhaps
for the length of time intervening between
it and the preceding one but it as-
sumed definite place in his memory that
made it stand out with the distinctness of
a mental semaphore above all the other
events of the ensuing ten or twelve hours
and this was most remarkable when one
takes into account that it was a wild night
almost an incredibly wild night

  the bath followed the kids return to
kellys room dumping dakes outfit of
khaki on the bed he winked warningly to
dake

  my friends were at home he said
they rustled this stuff right off the bat

  youre lucky kelly grunted busy
with the appearance of his leg-wraps i
didnt think they was two outfits to be had
in this mans town he nodded toward a
door theres the bathroom make it
snappy we want to get uptown before
the sleeping sickness hits everybody

  and that is how the kids bath came
about perhaps the quality that caused it
to linger in his memory lay in its uney
pectedness much after the fashion of meet-
ing a pleasant loved old friend after a long
absence at any rate as he turned on the
the florida kid



the blue

taps and felt his body permeating with
the steam that filled the little room he
knew for the first time in many moons the
fullness of the epicures satisfaction

   the kid loved cleanliness loved the feel
of a clear clean glowing skin loved the
texture of it the satisfaction the knowl-
edge the tingling flesh the air of buoy-
ancy everything that went with the cleans-
ing of his body for months he had been
kept away from this experience therefore
his unmeasured pleasure in the unexpected
bestowal of the moment

  as he stepped into the tub he wished
the minutes could be increased into hours-
hours m which he might lie in the tub
sleep in the tub with the water soaking
soaking soaking into his pores he felt his
skin drinking greedily of it as he lowered his
body slowly into the water slowly that he
might tuie longer continue the luxury of it
he could almost feel his skin expand
stretch taking in more of the cleansing
creamy warm soapy suds closing his
eyes he lay back luxuriating in the min-
utes as they passed until kellys rasping
voice broke into the spell

  make it snappy kelly barked its
almost midnight we want to be out among
em in half an hour make it snappy

  the kid grinned soaping his body
leisurely he took his full delight in the
touch of the cleansing element on his neck
shoulders back the little trickles of
water that ran from his fingers down his
chest carried too their touch of delight

  take a dollar out of my pants he
called to dake theres a place open
around the corner hurry down and get
me a union suit-forty-twos dont get
any of that sticky stuff and a pair of
socks-elevens

  came the clink of silver as dake went
through the pockets kelly was cursing
and fuming eager to be gone

  dake returned with the inner garments
and the kid stepped from the tub standing
in the middle of the bathroom luxuriating
in the new silkiness of his flesh as he pol-
ished with the rough towel his legs chest
arms and shoulders stepping into the
sleeping room he glanced at the clock on
the mantel fifteen minutes since he had
started into the bathroom fifteen minutes

  he had believed it an hour or more

a wild night followed the three men
 stood at main and h streets in the
midst of a hurrying laughing milling

throng and looked upon strange proceed-
ings a sailor stood on the manhole in the
center of the intersection with a toy balloon
in hand directing traffic one in the uni-
form of a soldier jealous of the brief au-
thority of the man in bell-bottomed trou-
sers came forth to do battle around and
about the two went in the midst of the
crowd that quickly gathered and cheered
them to fresh endeavors from a comer
a policeman watched and laughed as the
battle proceeded in a brace of minutes
reinforcements coming to the soldier the
sailor was carried away still kicking and
the manhole felt the weight of a new di-
rector of traffic

  hell get his in a minute kelly re-
marked come on-lets go way from
here this is kids stuff im lookin for
action myself

  halfway down the block before a hotel
another mass of men crouched stretched
and elbowed their way to a central point
kelly hesitated turned aside and made for
this point of interest with dake and the
kid at his heels voices came from the
center of the group

phebe if you love me win for me
came the click of ivory as the dice rat-
tled about in the speakers hand a tense
instant a following expletive an exclama-
tion

  hell i knew id phebe i always
phebe phebes mah mothers name its
good to me shoot the twenty bucks
whos down on me

  a hundred men were gathered about the
crap-shooters and the tenseness of their
actions told that this was no make-believe
affair it was real-as real as the silver
and bills spread out on the pavement in the
center of the ring kelly wormed his way
through the mass stretched to his toes and
turned to the kid

  gawd theres fi hundred bucks in
that game lets set in it this is my
kind of stuff lets-

  the kid shook his head i dont feel
lucky tomorrow-ill feel lucky then
the flash of color at a corner caught his
eye several girls laughing hilariously
were racing across the street pursued by
a band of roaring men

  lets go down there the kid sug-
gested

  when do i get my drink dake wor-
ried as the three made for the comer i
want some honest-to-god whisky im
as-
book magazine

  come on kelly commanded ill
show you theres seven places in the next
block

  as he led the way kelly explained the
method of purchasing the liquor

  you dont want no drink he told
dake what we want is a bottle-a
quart itll cost fifteen dollars but if you
buy it by the drink itll cost fifty bucks
well buy a quart and split the cost three
ways

iviountng broad stairs after he had
led dake and the kid off the street
kelly entered a long room on the second
floor of a building an orchestra played
in one end of the hall little tables were
strung about the sides and other end jap-
anese decorations hung from walls and ceil-
ing there was the reek of closely packed
bodies the uproar of loosened tongues

   my favorite bootlegger hangs out here
kelly grinned as he twisted through the
crowd set at this table order a soft
drink while i look for him when hes
gone he leaves a kid here to take orders for
him

   as they seated themselves and as dakes
eyes greedily followed the sinuous twisting
of the dancers the kid felt hands clutching
at his shoulders and voices crying into his
ears

  at last he made out the words from
the babel of sound heres our three sol-
dier boys come on girls heres the
three weve been looking for

  dake and kelly were grinning the kid
turned and met the glances from three pairs
of eyes flashing eyes and saw painted lips
cheeks heavied with carmine eyes and
lips gathered close a bold blonde-or one
who now was blonde-was the apparent
leader of the three

   i told you id get me a sergeant didnt
i she turned to her companions her
hands on the kids arm my sweetie was
a sergeant an i told you nothing else
would do didnt i

  her eyes and voice were tipsy the kid
studied her speculatively his eyes gradu-
ally narrowing appraisingly she drew
closer to him slipping an arm over his
shoulder and lifted her full lips close to
him

  you aint dated up are you she
purred

  the kid shook his head and blonde
laughed uproariously

   you jus think you aint she told him

by charles horn



youve been dated up since first i saw
you sarge

  chorus of answering laughter came from
the other girls dake and kelly continued
grinning then kelly remembered the duties
to guests

  set down he invited cordially his
voice lowered confidentially as the three
obeyed weve just ordered a bunch of
soft stuff but i know a bootlegger that
hangs out here and ill get a bottle of
scotch and-

  blonde interrupted yes you will
she cried we dont drink scotch do we
girls show him what youve got under
your coat bess she turned to the tall
dark-haired member of the trio giggling
bess brought forth a newspaper-wrapped
parcel

  dakea hands leaped to it clutched it
hid it beneath the table

  oh you neednt to be scared blonde
scoffed anything goes with you fellows
this week drink it right up on the table
as long as you keep it wrapped up

  lets dance dake suggested after the
soft drinks had arrived and vigorously were
spiked from the contents of the bundle bess
carried i used to be a swell dancer back
in harristown main kick in a dancing
club lets go gal

  dake and the black-haired girl whirled
their way through the throng the kid
speculative eyes upon blonde was con-
scious of dake for a few minutes then
the crowd swallowed the boy

  whats your other partners name
blonde asked aside of the kid

  kelly hes a railroad man

  blonde turned to kelly lifting the bottle
over his glass and pouring liberally

  have a lil drink kelly she invited
have a lil drink an get in a good humor
thass a good boy kelly

  kelly grinned laughed suddenly and
joyously at some vagrant thought that
came the girl moved close to him edging
her chair around the table the fingers
of her left hand on one of which glowed a
stone that would have been worth five thou-
sand dollars had it been real tapped kellys
arm tapped it persuasively possessively

  the crowd in the hall was thinning
waiters scoured at table tops near the kid
and his companions glancing meaningly as
they scoured

  catching that look the kid rose and
made a circuit of the room looked into
various booths but he did not find dake
the florida kid



chapter vii

oergeant carlton stood on a cor-
ner somewhat before the noon hour of
the following day and watched for dake
he had been walking the streets for more
than three hours saluting mechanically as
he noted the approach of leather leggings
or shoulder bars looking carefully into each
face and over the crowd into other faces
seeking dake and in the hours when he
sought for dake he felt the growth within
him of a great disgust for the depravity of
the hours and for the coarseness of those
women of the night yet even above this
and greater was a deep disgust with him-
self

  leaving the district of the shops he
mounted a hill that led to the south out
toward the residence district and after
hours as the tramping brought weariness
to his body he found himself resting in
shaded places and loitering before objects
of interest his mental scourging had
reached its apex he found tranquillity
coming

  coming upon a great new passenger
station he marveled at its length and
breadth and moved about in its great
halls gazing into the shops of different
sorts that lined its passageways a fellow
he decided could live within its walls in-
definitely without being forced outside for
any necessity a moving-picture show he
believed was all it lacked he wished he
could find a picture-show felt moved
toward a viewing of the capering of the
screen the shows were all downtown
however and he was disinclined to the
walk he would ramble over the station
perhaps dake would be found somewhere
in the great building dozens of men in
khaki were in sight

a lthough carlton had been in the
city several times in the last several
months he had never seen the new station
before his point of debarkation on those
other trips had been the railroad-yards in
the bottoms his place of stay had been
the slums and jungles down near the river
on those other passings through the city
there had been the eyes of the law to evade
-the bulls to slip but now the sergeant
steadily held the glances of each officer he
met they saluted him a friendly finger
touched the tips of their caps as kelly
had promised for a little time the city was
the property of the buddies

the blue

  sergeant carlton lounged outside the
great building basking in the sun that
warmed the wide cement parkway many
persons were about him an aged woman
smiled stopped asked a cheerful question
and passed on an old man on his black
hat an entwined cord of gold and silver
and on his sunken chest a copper medal
hanging on a tricolored bow approached
nervously returned sergeant carltons
quick salute and clasped the tall mans
biceps in trembling fingers

  ah the old man quavered as tall as
you are when i come back from gettys-
burg my laddybuck-as tall as you are

  chuckling senilely his head arms body
jerking in his palsy the man from gettys-
burg limped away

  a peace was coming into the tall red-
haired man he was beginning to know the
touch of an unineasured content he found
his thoughts could wing direct to any sub-
ject that came to them and that he had
lost the mental equivocation that had been
his in the last several weeks he felt ex-
ceptionally young-coltish almost were
he in the vicinity of trees he believed he
could run and swing from the branches
so jubilant was the youth within him

  basking in the suns heat his shoulders
lifted squared his great chest filled deeply
with the clear air of autumn he felt
greatly at peace at rest after some strife
that had shaken him in the days that had
gone ah he had it it had been the
necessity for evading the eyes of the pass-
ers in those days of the jungle gangs it
had been that quality within him that
caused him to slink up back streets to re-
main hidden so many times when a group
of clean men and women those about his
own age passed chatting and laughing
he had felt so keenly their curious eyes
there had been a deep shame at his un-
worthiness his uncleanness and this had
passed

  his great chest filled with the lifting of
this burden his nostrils expanded his
eyes cleared and he became in all ways
for the hour at least sergeant carlton of
the st the kid was gone fallen away
as falls unclean husk under the gleaners
hand

a nd in this moment the moment of his
great enchantment as sergeant carlton
stood in the sunlight withthe glow of a
conqueror burning in his eyes and with
his blood leaping and firing with the touch
book magazine



of the promise of something-some great
unnamable possession-a womans hand
touched his coat-sleeve and a womans
voice came to his ears turning quickly
he smiled into the eyes of the one who
had approached him

  her head reached well above the ser-
geants shoulder the hair that peeped be-
neath the ring of the wide hat was black
her eyes were brown-great pools of eyes
her lips were full colored with the red
healthy blood that touched them and were
curved with twinkling tremulous corners

  pardon me she said hurriedly i am
of a-a committee and we are seeking out
lonesome men-soldiers and sailors-and
trying to keep them from being lonesome
are you-are you lonesome a pathetic
nervousness was in her voice

very carlton answered and grinned
well-well i have been given a car
and im to take some one i find out for a
ride if they-if they wish to go or a
walk or a talk or anything just so we-

i keep them amused

  she forced a smile quietly carlton
stood looking at her his eyes narrowing
then the suspicious light left them

  is the car at your command any time
he asked

  any time she told him

  i suggest then he said easily and so
deeply was the kid lost that it was en-
tirely the old sergeant carlton who spoke
that you allow me to take you to lunch
its past that hour if youll be so good
and the ride can come afterward if youll
again be so good

  for the moment she stood hesitant

  i dont see why- she began theres
nothing-

  the sergeant interrupted quickly turn-
ing he guided her to the entrance to the
rotunda and to the door of the restaurant
she stopped turned to him

  remember she said this is on-on
the committee

  not at all theres nothing doing
  but she expostulated i-

  of course he said quietly and there
was a steadiness in his gaze that brought
a flush to her cheeks if there-if you
object but id like to-it would be a
great pleasure to have you as my guest
we could-

  her gay laugh cut into the words tak-
ing his arm again she turned from the
door out toward the street

  come on she said laughingly of

by charles horn

course ill be your guest lets dont stand
and argue like a couple of millionaires
buying a drink i know the dandiest place
two or three blocks down the street thats
quiet i dont care to hear people eat do
you

chapter viii

come few events were mirrored in carl-
tons life with a million-candle-power
brilliancy and among these his hours with
this girl engraved themselves indelibly on
his memory

  he could not have told afterward of
the manner of their speech he could not
have repeated their words in that first hour
he merely knew that she spoke he an-
swered and that there was laughter in her
voice and in his ears he knew she found
a table in the restaurant well to the rear
and that an old woman who limped came
to wait on them

  when the girl had removed her hat with
a gesture of relief as they seated them-
selves he saw that her hair carried a
strange mark above the middle of her
forehead dividing the black locks was a
width of white glistening white a white
that seemed alive so different was it from
the rest of her hair so unexpected was the
sight of it seeing his eyes upon it she
smiled

  daddy used to call it my lovelock
she said whew im glad to get my
hat off i bought it a day or two ago
in--the words were clipped back-and
im afraid it doesnt fit

   its very beautiful

  thank you i liked its shape but- 
i mean the strange lock of hair in-
oh that she was confused thank
you it worried me when i was little
anything unusual worries a child i think
i hated the thought of anything unusual
being in my appearance i cut it out once
but it grew back now well-

  its beautiful-striking carlton said
again

  thank you so much-so much

  other charms he found in her clear
eyes for instance eyes that mirrored clean
thoughts eyes that looked into his calmly
with girlish candor that drooped at other
times wavering and faltering

  im sergeant carlton he introduced
himself

  i am helen proctor she said
the florida kid

  they sat side by side at the small table
and a thought came to carlton of the
dance-hall of the night previous he shud-
dered whipping the thought away as the
meal progressed and as they lingered at
its close he fancied in the girls manner a
nervousness that rose and fell that brought
quick breaks to her words and rambling
inconsequences to her sentences pushing
back the untouched dessert she rose
quickly

  ill phone for the car well go for
our ride she said carlton stood beside
his chair as she turned away hurried to
the front of the restaurant and bent to the
phone

a glad golden-red sunset the long
rays sent their red streamers waver-
ing billowing across the ripples of a little
lake in a great park of the city carlton
and the girl were strolling through the
paths passing deserted booths-the after-
noon crowd had left for its supper-idling
along greatly content in the silence that
had come after the hours of broken il-
logical conversation the afternoon had
in some strange way brought the two
marvelously close to each other it seemed
they had known one another for months
for years timidly carlton indicated a
stand piled high with ice-cream cones and
confections the girl laughingly shook
her head

  not that she said id much rather
have one of those she pointed to where
a fat man perspired back of a fire on which
hot dogs simmered

  if its all right carlton questioned
why foolish of course its all right
everybody eats them at parks

  i was just thinking though-

  ill always be a kid i reckon she
laughed where hot dogs are concerned
lets sit over here and watch the sunset
and after they were seated on a bench
at the waters edge some of this brings
back home-the sunset for instance and
these hot dogs too theres a peak back
of the ranch-i live in the san bernardino
mountains-where so many picnic parties
have gathered that we have named it hot
dog hill it is-

  do you live in the san bernardino
mountains carlton asked

  yes do you know where they are
california ive been over them several
times

  how fine then you know my state

the blue

  a little he confessed just going
over it stopping and going on

  the mountains border the desert she
continued dreamily and the valleys on
the north is the great desert hundreds of
miles across and on the south are valleys
upon valleys filled with fruits and flowers
and people they are all very beautiful-
the flowers and fruits i am hungry for
it all-homesick i was never homesick
before in my life because i was never so
far from home i believe

there was a long silence carlton had
 not caught the significance of her
words then

  that-that story about the committee
and everything was untrue she said in a
small voice it was-

  startled carlton straightened up

  it was a lie she went on evenly i
am a school-teacher-that is i taught last
year then i came east on a trip the
school maams regular trip i had no ap-
pointment for this term and just kept on
traveling i can get on again though if
i care to

  still carlton was silent his eyes held a
startled glow it had been a matter that
lay wholly with herself then this singling
him out

  i have been in this city three days
she went on i ate my breakfast in that
little restaurant where we had lunch and
oh i was desperately lonely that was

all my brother-was across and

-well it got him

  her quiet tones ceased the shadows
drew closer the evening became more in-
timate it seemed suddenly the lights
flashed on around the lake and up and
down the paths of the park the girl
sighed

  ben had written of the way the people
treated the boys-dinner parties rides and
all you know and-well i was just a kid

when the war was on at least

there was little i could do-actively do
you know

  carlton nodded with a stick he had
picked up he traced little patterns in the
sand leaning over his elbows on his knees

  then when i saw you so desperately
alone as i was i just-well i became
suddenly brave she finished with a
crooked little smile do you think it so
awfully terrible the lying and every-
thing

  carlton drew a deep breath-leaned back
book magazine



and looked into her eyes his own glowing
softened

  i think it a most beautiful evasion

  she laughed and a half-sobbing catch
was in it i was lonely a fat man had
been following me i walked to the sta-
tion hoping to lose him i had-

  i saw him carlton interrupted

  and then i saw you i knew you were
a stranger and i knew how terrible is the
lonesomeness of one among a crowd of
strangers sometimes i have almost cried
out for some one to speak to me to be
nice to me to say howdy and smile
ill never take another long trip alone

  a little silence then

  i am on my way to california carl-
ton said perhaps i may-

  good why how dandy will you
tour out

  the sergeant grinned aside nodded
ill be a tourist all right he replied

  you must stop to see us she glowed
with the invitation ill have-i think
ill have the ranch with chickens on it
by the time youre in the state itll be
a month or two anyway wont it
yes he replied soberly itll be a
month or two-at least

  im thinking of the chicken business
she went on seriously dad left me a
ranch up in a canon theres plenty of
land plenty of water and enough tillable
acreage to grow feed for the fowls and
some stock ive been looking up the
chicken business on this trip and therell
be little competition right around my place

i believe it will be a money-maker im
sure it will beat teaching and it will be
outdoors too i hate the inside of a house
you must stop and see my ranch when
you come into the state ill be expecting
you

  the sergeant mused again tracing little
patterns with the pointed stick he turned
to her squarely

  when i come to the state he said
ill probably be looking for work i wont
be broke but-

  that neednt bother you most of
those who come are looking for work of
one sort or other since the automobile has
been bringing so many flivver gypsies
then youre not a rich man in disguise or
anything like that she asked gayly

  carlton grinned the tinkle of the girls
tones mingled with his clipped short
laughter

  good she cried its so much better

by charles horn

to tell each other our real first names and
telephone-numbers and everything isnt it

  and when you come out to california
she told him lapsing again into seriousness
youll make your fortune dad came out
years ago and while he didnt make his
fortune he was ever so much better off
than in the kentucky days and he was
broke when he arrived in the state in
fact ive come to believe that the success
of the west has been built up of people
who were broke that is one of the rea-
sons they made good-it was a case of
must the majority of them were too far
from home to call for help and it was dig
in or starve they dug in and made good
youll do the same

  i hope so

  you mustnt only hope-you must be-
lieve sincerely she continued that
was dads great philosophy that what a
man believes can be done will be done
in a measure he was an example of his
belief he had two mules a rickety wagon
a wife and two children when he came over
cajon pass fifteen years ago he fought
against lack of education fought against
sickness that took my mother and him
he died last year-broken-hearted over
bens death it came so close too to
mothers being taken away just two
years ben was shell-shocked and for a
year was-well not right you know

  carlton nodded comprehendingly

  dad left his ranch in the hills its not
much of a place as california ranches go
though theres the beauty of the canon
around it and the mountains back of it
but its ours-mine now

  im going to try to make it go-no
im going to make it go she said deter-
minedly im going to make a real ranch
out of it-mortgage it to stock it ill
follow dads teaching ill seek the objec-
tive i want go after it and determine to
get it ill make it go its as much a
womans work as anything else i hate
teaching i want to be out of doors out
where ive lived all my life

vwatching her studying her carlton
 marveled at the lines of character that
developed suddenly in her features her
face hardened her eyes narrowed this
was no shrinking giggling girl carlton
knew this was a specimen of the women
the west had built some of the bulldog
determination that must have been her
fathers had descended to the daughter
the florida kid

  when full darkness had come the girl
lifted to her feet

the make-believe is over she said
lightly lets go out and tell the driver of
that hired car to hit the grit hes-
instant contrition came into the sergeant
you shouldnt he began it was all
so-it was such an expense and-

  her gay laugh interrupted

  you foolish why ive had thousands
of dollars worth of fun this afternoon
just imagine pretending im a committee
and everything-just doing something i
shouldnt i reckon her hand fell again
to his arm as they threaded their way
through the throngs that were beginning
to fill the park a red-haired sergeant
she said and a big car with a chauffeur
and playing the dignified lady why it
was worth thousands dont be foolish
now

  but he still objected we could
have-

  it was wonderful then quickly
but lets do this well go to a picture-
show well go down in the street-car
will that be all right

 carlton nodded

  it was nearing midnight carlton and
helen proctor sat in the womans lobby
of a small family hotel on the east side
plans for the morrow were in the making

  ill meet you at nine the girl said
well have the whole day

  the whole day carlton murmured
bells were ringing in his ears

it was the afternoon of the following day

	carlton and the girl were again in the
great park in the southern part of the city
it appealed to them as a homey place with
nooks hidden by bushes where two per-
sons could sit quietly talking and dream-
ing

  only a few hours she said and
sighed and when you get near the pass
-youll come over cajon pass of course-
ask anyone the way to proctors ranch
theyll know it isnt far from the rail-
road and you must come out

  a lingering quality was in her words
and in the manner of both man and woman

  youre sure she asked that youll be
out to see me

  as certainly as i live

  she sighed again he imagined a tinge
of rebellion in her manner

by charles horn



  it was half after eleven that night
they stood at the gates to the track and
the last coach of her train stood back of
the grating across a little space

  i must go now she said good-by
sergeant-red-haired s e r g e a n t the
heaviness in her tones she attempted to
lighten with jocular words when a
bright light comes up the trail day or
night ill know it is the red-haired ser-
geant come to me youre not sensitive
about it she asked quickly a timidity
had come to her carlton laughed gayly

  good-by girl he took her two hands
youve been-been wonderful thanks
for the great time and ill be out good-
by hungrily he hung to the bars of the
grating

  after a minute she came out upon the
platform of the last car called to him and
they talked nervously hurriedly until the
train started as the long line of coaches
snaked their way out of the shed and as
the last car dimmed out of sight carlton
stood with his eyes hungrily seeking the
last sight of her his hard hands gripping
the bars clenching them while she waved
to him-waved and waved and waved to
him

ror hours afterward he walked the
 streets aimlessly turning corners stop-
ping standing at times uncovered then on
again she-she had believed that was
the miracle of it she had believed of
the future she had spoken-indefinitely and
casually it is true but in this future she
had traced glorious heights to be reached
glorious deeds to be done glorious rewards
that would follow the man whom she
limned in the hours they had been to-
gether was completely abstract but carl-
ton felt now the entering of the spark
she had awakened for this other man

  a fellow could work she had said and
study law and architecture and drawing
and bookkeeping-these she had mentioned
as open to those who strove glorious
gates of promise she had held ajar for him
a fellow could do anything that was the
burden of her belief and once in a still
wavering little voice she had ventured the
opinion that in a way all this was easier
after marriage than before not so many
outside pleasures recreations and things to
pull on a fellow quieter in his home and
all that

a well-known blue book writer who has recently returned from a
remarkable trip through little known parts of the far east here
contributes a fascinating and authentic story of jungle adventure

 by warren hastings miller

if a man slander you invite him on a

	dangerous big-game hunt along with
the man whose good opinion of you
he is undermining then he will have to
either make good or shut up

  gene barr achieved this bit of philoso-
phy all by himself after much worrying
about douke the dutch engineer of su-
matra fame and viper tongue douke was
a pest the kind of man who considered
every brother engineer in the east a faker
and was always telling people that such-
and-such a man and so forth but gene
felt that his idea was the medicine that
would fix him and now was the time too
for he had a new and particularly dan-
gerous kind of big game in hand to try it
out with

  he sat in a long-armed india cane chair
sprawled out under a waving punkah
within his borneo bungalow turning over
the idea judicially in his mind his wide
mouth curled in a thin-lipped smile as he
twisted a thoughtful chin between thumb
and forefinger gene felt that even though



solomon had beaten him to it with the
original of his idea he should have gone
into the law instead of engineering in his
youth the idea had such soul-satisfying
possibilities for justice and retribution
and douke the great the mighty for all
his palembang oil-refinery reputation was
such an exasperating liar gene had known
the pudgy and florid little hollander for
some time knew also those pale blue eyes
of his which gave you instinctive warning
of the treachery behind them knew fur-
thermore the wry sneer which always sat
on his lip another give-away a warning
to the wise even when douke was ob-
viously trying to say something pleasant
every human being save himself was a
faker on doukes acid tongue this trait
of unconscious slander was altogether ex-
asperating because so hard to combat

  doukes rapacious instinct for pushing
everyone else down so as somehow to ad-
vance himself was probably at the bottom
of it the man perhaps never slandered
others with willful and deliberate purpose
babi itam besar



the blue

-it seemed hard to accuse him as far as
that gene reasoned but still there was
his sarcastic and unbridled tongue just a
hint or a word maybe but every engineer
all over the east suffered from it it used
to make gene shudder to hear some friend
of his who had made some small and
recent success referred to by douke as
dot tam faker without any rhyme or
reason at all either it generally turned
out that douke did not even know his
victim personally enough for him that
the man had gained a small measure of
reputation which somehow might in some
way detract from his own and engineer-
ing reputation particularly oil engineer-
ing refinery experience was what counted
these days among the british oil magnates
for out here in the wide and far-flung
archipelago from burma to borneo what
oil engineers there were were well scat-
tered and opportunities to know them
personally were few you had only their
reputations to go on

r enes judicial mind went on enlarging
on the idea of inviting both douke and
mr fretcher the english oil magnate on
this big-game trip fate it seemed had
put the cards right in his hand he
grinned more widely and his long frame
hunched up with delight as the idea grew
gene was never a handsome person to
look at his face was tanned and seamed
and hard-bitten from years of tropical
engineering work his hair was scanty
and grayish inclined to baldness above his
temples the whole face was that of the
hard and serious thinker the man whose
livelihood depended upon straight thinking
and also something more in the tropics the
ability to think quickly and right in a
crisis yet here was douke with his ever-
lasting faker his conceit of the palem-
bang refinery achievement making him
odious here was douke already at mr
fretcher with those little casual innuendoes
of his which would soon send glimmering
any chances gene might have at the new
balikpapan refinery which the british oil
corporation proposed for borneo

  it was exasperating because there had
been no way to head douke off and show
him up yet gene smiled to himself with
judicial calmness for now-the man who
had placed the solution of the whole mat-
ter in his hands had just left the bungalow
he was only a dyak hunter named migi
bulieng but he had just brought news of

babi itam besar the giant black boar
of borneo located up near kong beng
some two days march back in the jungle

ow ordinarily babi itam besar would

	 be simply an interesting scientific
curiosity all borneo had been waiting to
hear more of him since the explorer
lumholtzs book had come out in 
at that time all that was known of this the
largest of the worlds boars had been con-
jectured from a single skull in the
museum at berlin the tushes were want-
ing from that skull but judging from its
size babi must be as big a jersey cow
and exceedingly formidable lumholtz
had heard of it alive in regions where no
dyak dared to hunt and he had published
his opinion that the creature was none
other than the fabulous neduma of the
dyaks an animal which they were vague
about describing but very definite in being
afraid of lumholtz did not succeed in
coming up with the creature himself but
from  on every big-game hunter in
borneo from banjermassin to samarinda
had standing orders out with the natives
to report the first one located

  on receipt of the news from migi gene
had first thought of merely inviting mr
fretcher alone it would be a graceful bit
of friendship without too much the air of
currying favor professionally fretchers
hobby was big game his big place out
in the suburbs of calcutta was a veritable
museum of game heads india burma
africa canada-there was nowhere he
had not gone during recreational periods
in pursuit of his favorite hobby to give
him then the first chance at babi itam
besar an entirely new species new even
to science would please the oil magnate
immensely besides gene knew some-
thing of the british psychology which was
to accept a man in toto provided he made
good in any specialty of the outdoors-
whether athletics big-game hunting or
salmon fishing if you were sound there
your reputation professionally would carry
you so far as business was concerned
this point of view was an obsession with
mr fretcher rarely had gene heard of
him taking on a man without first trying
him out on a big-game trip there his
courage and resourcefulness in a crisis
would be tried out and these things were
much more important in mr fretchers
eyes than mere technical ability any
professor could have that-but what good
book magazine

was he when floods came and washed
away an entire new plant or cholera
abolished the whole personnel or land-
slides overwhelmed your months of labor
catastrophes these that nature was al-
ways providing to try out a mans soul
in the unregenerate tropics

   yes at first it had been a mere generous
impulse on genes part to invite mr
fretcher to share the excitements of tack-
ling this unknown giant boar with him
then came the dazzling idea-why not
invite douke the slanderer too gene
had heard ad nauseam of a certain tiger
that douke had shot in sumatra if big-
game men were foregathered in some
oriental hotel over their scotch and soda
and douke happened to be among them
he was sure to bring up that tiger all
others were mere kittens compared to this
brute your bengal may have been all
right-but you ought to have seen this
sumatra terror to gene it was all of a
piece with his habit of calling every other
engineer in the east a faker-there was a
bottomless abyss of personal incompetence
in it somewhere or else the man would
have been content to live and let others
live all he needed was showing up-and
that would be the last of slanderer douke
oh it was a ripping idea gene felt at
that moment that the law should really
have been his profession

tie got up out of the india chair and
  put on his white military blouse with
stiff starched collar worn over a net under-
shirt and nothing else down here under
the equator the sun beat down like a
cannonade of fire upon genes topee as he
stalked down into the town of the little
oil port of balikpapan keeping to the
shady side of the road under the huge
war ingen trees on his way to the wireless
station where he wrote out an aerogram

   babi itam besar located come at once

   if possible bring douke my compliments

                                       barr

  that last was a masterstroke douke
was now with fretcher somewhere up in
tennasserim in burma on an oil-exploring
party not that douke was at all needed
up there but he had a way of fastening
himself to the powers that be and had
done so with fretcher the moment he got
wind of the proposed new refinery at
balikpapan what he was saying about
him now that they were both rivals for

by warren hastings miller

the job gene could well imagine not
so very much-a contemptuous laugh here
a veiled reference to some one of barrs
early mistakes out east at the next op-
portunity douke was subtle enough
gene had watched his method with other
engineers whose jobs douke wanted or
perhaps did not even have a chance at-
but a bit of slander thrown at them might
do him some possible good sometime

  such men are exasperatingly hard to
shut up gene knew from personal ex-
perience with douke in defense of his
friends and he sensed his danger uneasily
inviting douke with fretcher was the
winning trick for the dutchman could not
back out as he surely would have if
gene had invited him separately as it
was fretcher would simply cart him down
here on the next b e i steamer willy-
nilly good business all around too
gene reflected as he turned away from the
cable station to arrange about dogs and
dyak bearers instead of fretcher invit-
ing him as a sort of test he had turned
the tables on the genial magnate and
provided the big game himself

ctve days later gene stood at early
dawn looking down from the veranda
of his bungalow on the hill down into
the blue and placid little harbor of
balikpapan east borneo the java-
pacific mail-boat outward bound from
sourabaya for san francisco was nosing
her way in past the nests of oil-tanks
which jutted out on a slender point into
the deeper water gene eyed the boat
with his usual judicial air figuring that if
fretcher had acted promptly he could
have caught her via singapore by taking
the next b e i from rangoon im-
mediately upon receipt of his cable he
was presently reassured by the sight of
two white-clad figures in white and bowl-
shaped india topees waving to him from
the distant rail of the steamer far below
the tall one was fretcher without a
doubt the short man douke so he had
brought the swine along against his will
or not gene smiled grimly

  an hour later the three were sitting at
a rattan table out on genes veranda
awaiting migi and his dogs coolies
brought something that tinkled with ice
in tall glasses fretcher was his usual
urbane self with his characteristic iron
smile-handsome tall keen-visaged his
high and tanned forehead surmounted by
babi itam besar



the blue

thick curly iron-gray locks brushed back
in a perpetual pompadour that made him
look even taller than he was

  i say jolly decent of you barr to
think of us in the matter of this pig
yknow he was remarking urbanely while
his gray eyes took in genes whole self
with an unfathomable expression which
might mean that fretcher was pleased
over genes generosity or might mean that
his mind may have been already poisoned
by some innuendo of doukes that this
whole affair smacked somewhat of the
greek bearing gifts douke himself was
saying nothing and looking unhappy his
eyes met both of theirs shiftily and for
once they heard nothing of that sumatran
tiger of his

  gene caught another idea from that un-
easy half-scared expression on doukes
face the man had been dragged here
by reason of his own boasting tongue he
had not dared back out or plead excessive
engagements with bluff and genial old
fretcher around-who wouldnt take no

o	slanderer your chicks are coming home
to roost thought gene as he poised the
lampoon

  to tell the truth fretcher he
answered in my judgment this babi itam
besar is a bit too much of a brute for any
one man to tackle alone you know what
that berlin skull tells us-a boar as big as
a cow hide on him no doubt thick as
a rhino tushes ten inches long hell
take a lot of killing

jir fretcher eyed gene keenly

	this remarkable hesitancy in wiry old
barr who had stood by his side and shot
like a fiend when the two of them had
bagged a six-hundred-pound siberian tiger
up in the himalayas these yanks were
cagy his expression seemed to say and
they generally had a double meaning in
most of their-to the english-cryptic
remarks a side-glance at douke settled
it barr was ragging him pulling a long
bow on the terrors of babi for the dutch
boasters benefit mr fretcher smiled his
grim iron smile and helped with that
subtle humor the briton also possesses

  no end of a swine what he replied
with the utmost cheerfulness what
rifle barr old thing

  gene pointed to an american  rifle
standing in one corner of the veranda
good enough for this yank i want
something that will shoot and keep right

on shooting when babi makes his charge
he glanced at douke who was looking
uneasily at the american rifle and think-
ing very little himself about any sumatran
tiger he may have once shot mr fretcher
purred amiably

  not a hope my boy you want some-
thing that will knock him down to stay
yknow if you cawnt do it in two shots
youre no good something like this i
he fished out of a breeches pocket a
cartridge that looked as if it fitted in some
piece of naval ordnance douke at sight
of it cheered up taking his cue from what
he considered the magnates disapproval
of the american rifle

  der man dot takes a sheap yankee
gun after dangerous beeg game iss a tam
fool he declared gracefully

  gene eyed him casually the usual
clumsy dutch insult embracing ones
nationality oneself and ones weapon all
in one sentence no use arguing with
him that so you watch my smoke i
he contented himself with replying

  mr fretcher purred on them both
with the calm superiority of the briton
ruler of all the earth really barr old
cock my word its not gun enough for
babi is it better take one of my double
rigbys and crash into the jolly old pig
with both barrels hadnt you

  douke pushed in most eagerly pressing
his advantage in making out gene in the
wrong or at least pig-headed about it
yah dots righdt he agreed if you vas
fool enough to go near dot peeg with dot
toy of a yankee gun he takes it avay
from you vit hees tushes and shpanks you
vit it

  mr fretcher cut him short

  dont be a silly ass douke lets get
on with it gentlemen he suggested ris-
ing to go within the bungalow and shift
into jungle kit he carted douke off with
him laying a masterful hand on that irate
little hollanders shoulder and propelling
him off the veranda gene was left to
himself for a while to reflect judicially
upon the situation as regards his chances
of getting the balikpapan refinery so far
not the least hint of his attitude in that
matter had come from fretcher that was
not the english way after the hunt
there would be cigars ever the campfire
and something would be said once for all
and finally gene did not even know
whether he and douke were still rivals for
the position there might already be an

     in many respects this is the most remarkable novel the blue book mag-

     long story its original title was the clear pane the significance of
     which will be apparent to the reader when he takes up the third and last
     installment in the march issue what mr horn has tried to show in his
     vivid realistic work is the exact status with himself of a private in that
     vast army of floaters in america the men who work when work is
     absolutely necessary but only then-who at other times are tramps
     the florida kid in this story is a personality of such dominance in the
     world he inhabits that it has been deemed best to let the story carry
     as its title his trampdom monaker you will remember him and
     recall portions of his philosophy and incidents in his lurid life long

the blue

deep in the tough soil yet not so large as
one would expect from a boar weighing
seven hundred pounds and as big as a
jersey cow a totally unknown creature-
never shot before

  fretcher had bagged wart-hog in africa
and babirusa on celebes and pig-stick-
ing in his own india had become a tame
sport to him yet now he shook his head
this the largest of the worlds boars
would be formidable enough as formi-
dable as wild buffalo or rogue elephant not
to mention stripes and the lion what
would be his method of attack where
place your bullet would any rifle have
stopping power enough to prevent him
doing damage on the charge one thing
was certain the dogs were useless they
would have to walk him up themselves sufi
cringed away unmindful of the blows
and encouragements which migi showered
on him in mixed doses the rest of the
pack hung back taking their cue from
him

  well lets get on with it exclaimed
fretcher exasperatedly after the dogs had
been reasoned with in vain well have
to walk the blighter up

i ie set off along the line of tracks douke
 opened his rifle slyly to take a peep
within and assure himself that each barrel
had its cartridge barr left him thumb-
ing his safety apparently setting it off re-
gardless of whom that might endanger
he hurried to catch up with fretcher who
walked like a moose he paid no atten-
tion to his own rifle he knew it was
loaded and had a cartridge in its chamber
all that was left to do was to cock the
hammer

  the tracks led up toward that hot
spring they were easy to follow for the
deep shade of the tapangs had killed off
most of the usual jungle undergrowth
no one said much as they followed along
that sinister line of tracks the dogs had
stayed back with migi who would not
budge a foot after them declaring that
these were the tracks of that fabulous
animal nedumah greatly feared by the
dyaks there were whole tracts in east
borneo where neither penihing nor
penyabong nor kenyah would hunt be-
cause of him

  fretcher stopped once or twice to point
out enormous rootings scarred and slashed
with tushes that must have been at least
ten inches long he nodded at them

grimly while gene looked down silent and
solemn

  the swines like to jump us without
warning any moment now whispered
fretcher bending aside a vine to peer
through the jungle toward the mist of the
hot spring ahead i fawncy hell be
wallowing somewhere in this warm mud
hell take some shooting my word 

  barr moved off to the right gun-muzzle
up and poised in both hands so as to push
along ready to shoot on the instant his
eyes watching ahead for a place to plant a
foot without treading on a cobra a huge
and gloomy cave of foliage this the sun
never penetrated here save in isolated
slanting rays of golden haze birds were
so far overhead that even the sharp call
of the minah did not disturb the silence
a place to meet the dreaded hamadryad
cobra fourteen feet long and aggressively
deadly if not babi ltam besar himself

  and then there was a sudden flurry of
grunts a loud and prolonged squeal of
rage a crash in the bushes a flying shower
of water and mud thump of heavy hoofs
something huge and black was standing in
a dense glade of begonia ahead of him
formless shapeless watching him perhaps
for his next step barrs rifle half rose as
he peered intently into the thicket what-
ever it was it was not twenty yards off
how long would it take a boar to charge
twenty yards about three seconds gene
figured after a moments reflection in-
teresting rather

  then fretchers double rigby bellowed
out mark your way yank came
the shout of his voice from out a thin
cloud of smoke over to the right

  babi ltam besar had raised a squall
like a factory whistle an intolerable din
filling all the forest with his pain and rage
then he grunted fiercely as he spied barr
standing still as death in the jungle and
looking for him barr caught a glimpse
of a nest of long white tushes tossing up
and down of a huge black and hairy
snout of little pig eyes that gleamed
diabolically from under shaggy wire
bristles then his repeater ripped out a
less powerful roar than the cannonlike
report of the rigby but spiteful a yell
a trumpet-blast of rage came from babi
ltam besar and with it fretchers shout
cawnt see him yank your brute

  there was a terrific uproar in the vines
smashing tearing and trampling barr
perceived that he had hit him above the
book magazine



foreleg smashing it and that babi was
spinning around and around on it bellow-
ing like a hurt bear he waited coolly for
a good shot to present itself then acting
on a sudden hunch circled around into a
clear glade whipping out his pocket
camera as he ran

  for-gods-sake i protested fret-
cher as he came out into view dont try
it yank -look out

 hold still a minute hes

busy with that leg and ill get a picture
said barr hurriedly opening and focusing
the instrument wait up

  not in a thousand years yelped
fretcher bursting wrathfully out of a
tangle of vines hes dangerous manl
cut it

  he raised the heavy rifle to shoot but
at the moment babi itam besar rocked up
on three legs spied barr his most evident
enemy and charged home the finder
showed a great black bristling creature
bearing down upon him with tushes low-
ered malignantly barr snapped the
shutter and flung the camera into the
bush leaping in the opposite direction
himself babi swerved after him boring
murderously intent and purposeful after
him through the undergrowth gene felt
that it was going to be a close call but he
kept his head another frantic side-leap
and babi had passed him a great shaggy
roached-back thing his tushes slashing
savagely in a side-swing of his long head
barr whirled and fired at close range into
his side he himself was breathing
hoarsely from the intense exertion the
fierce play of life and death in it but his
brain was cool immensely interested in
how long he was going to keep alive before
this brute

  a shot from fretcher coming up be-
hind raked babi as he turned to seek barr
again he grunted hoarsely frothy blood
from that first lung shot of fretchers
dripping from his jaws he swung his
head from side to side then stopped ey-
ing barr fixedly and with murderous
desire burning in his eyes the repeater
spoke-a heart shot this time right in be-
tween the two shaggy front forepaws and
under the chin still babi stood swaying
slightly bent on another charge

  damn the brute barked fretcher
wrathfully did you ever see such a
thick-skinned pachyderm ill ruin him
if i fire again

  dont shoot sir in my opinion hes

by warren hastings miller

done for said barr watching him keenly

  slowly babi itam besar sank down
his grunts became hoarse sighs gradually
changing into comfortable little pig noises
as if he thought all was well with him and
he was falling asleep-which he was

and now sir-now spoke up fret-
 cher with rising tones of curiosity
in his voice man de-arr he purred
will you tell me just when and how you
came to think of that camera stunt man
itll be the prize of the whole trip if that
picture comes out i have scientific
friends who will value that above even the
skin and the skeleton but i had no
thought of trying to photograph babi itam
besar myself i assure you

  why i didnt think of it at all-just
came to me thats all said gene there
was the chance while he was down on a
broken foreleg and i took it

  quite so smiled fretcher grimly
we are looking for that kind of man
yknow- i say wheres douke he asked
the association of ideas suddenly recalling
him to memory

  search me grinned gene now in
my judgment-

  bosh cut in fretcher you havent
got any judgment he smiled good-
humoredly only what you americans
call hunch which is better any man that
would face a wounded boar with a camera
yknow  now where-

  just then douke put in his appearance
waddling through the foliage a complac-
ent smile on his face the lord knows
where he had been lurking during all this
but apparently he expected words to carry
him along still me i got lost-tam
goot lost in diss verfliichter yungle he
explained fatuously barefacedly dots
a goot peegl mr fretcher i congratshu-
lates you he added ignoring gene as he
looked over the fallen babi itam besar
whose tushes ten inches long and eleven
spread lay over on one side like gory white
daggers

  mr fretcher looked at him long and
fixedly

  humph he snorted ah yes douke
i see-lost quite so-rather you have
my word yknow

  and he looked over at gene and there
was that in his eyes that told barr that
something very definite would be said over
the cigars that night concerning the
engineering position
upon the lion and adder

        the saga of a young man who ventured far and fought hard for
        his own one of the most powerful stories this or any other maga-
        zine ever published with a unique and deeply impressive climax

by john m oskison

that miller should be robbed of his
share was first suggested by kuhns
a clay-stained practical psychologist
who spoke fretfully because little creatures
under the filthy gray flannel shirt he wore
annoyed him

  after all is said miller is no use to the
vorld he makes no difference in the
scheme of things-no more than a clod
he is a clod if i step on the clod or not
it does not matter soon the rain come
and the vind-pouf dust to dust

  you have made an argument dempsey
that is piffle all that runs in your head
is-humanity all very fine but i ask
you-i ask you also fonda and you
rogers-he jabbed a gnarled broken-
nailed forefinger at each in turn -if it is
vorth to me and you and you and you
eight thousand dollars apiece to satisfy this
appetite for humanity is it so great a
hunger no he laughed and spat to-
bacco-juice across the trail of a myriad of
marching burdened ants he pointed to
the wreckage caused to the scurrying about
of threatened survivors their quickly dis-

covered detour the prompt resumption of
their march

  again here is miller a blind vorker
like one of these ants take his treasure
from him and he vill go around like this
for a moment-kuhns raised his thick
arms skyward closed his eyes and wriggled
his fingers in eloquent pantomine-and
then he go to vork again to find more
no he looked round upon the three
sitting cross-legged about the fire in front
of the dilapidated log bunkhouse that
abutted upon a disordered heap of crum-
bling blue dirt red rock and rusting tins
his eyes questioned them dempsey stirred
pushed a broken felt hat nervously back
on a sweat-stained forehead

  just the same fritz its plain robbery
yere proposin it was however scarcely
a protest

  oh the vord  fonda

  the mexican turned the palms of his
hands upward swiftly and raised his shoul-
ders

  so  rogers

  im listenin he was half the age of


upon the lion arid adder

kuhns a scattering of fair stubble beard
nearly hid a pointed chin the edges of a
great sore on the back of his right hand
itched and he gave his attention to that

  all right i speak again

ia rawing his knees up kuhns clasped
his powerful hands across his shins and
went on patiently

  tomorrow comes the lawyer for hagen
from cripple with the papers and the cash
for our mine-a hundred and sixty thou-
sand we all sign the papers and in the
presence of the lawyer we divide the money
into five equal parts-thirty-two thousand
dollars apiece-and each of us pockets his
including miller of course

  we stay here tomorrow night we turn
in to sleep but for the first three hours
dempsey and i do not sleep then we
wake fonda and rogers who vill watch if
miller sleeps while they pretend to sleep
sometime in the night-we hope-miller
goes sound asleep and we take his money
anyway we take his money we hide it
in a place we must now decide upon miller
wakes in the morning no money some
one has robbed him we are sorry-that is
all his eyes flashed and he released a
hand to gesture stabbingly

  why not is this miller a pal of ours
i ask you he comes to us broke with a
story about a mine-not this mine you
vill remember he vill not drink play
cards see the girls he comes with us
from denver he only vorks eats sleeps
says nothing such is miller

  we are different our vorld is full of
life and the hunger we have for-he was
about to say joy and adventure but
checked the words-good times is the
hunger that forty thousand dollars vill sat-
isfy better than thirty-two thousand

  wont miller raise hell queried young
rogers open-eyed

  what if he does four against one
dempsey was at any rate logical

  we will give him one hundred pesos
promised fonda highly happy now in the
firm grip of avarice and run him out of
camp

  not more  warned kuhns he would
be better with nothing so that he get to
vork again soon-and forget

as miller the reticent took the long
twisting trail up from the lonely dingy-
red section-house on the railroad-a
knobby canvas-wrapped package of canned

goods chewing tobacco cigarette mak-
ins and two new packs of playing-cards
on his back-he resumed a daydream that
was rooted far back in his boyhood

   hens fluffing their feathers in the hot
powdery dust of a rented texas farm a
skinny tow-headed little scarecrow in
patched blue overalls barefoot staggering
under the weight of a chopping hoe in a
weedy muggy cotton-field eternal sicken-
ing diet of bacon beans boiled potatoes
heavy biscuits sour molasses flitting rest-
ful-heavenly restful-intervals of country
school when a languid teacher fought un-
convincingly to force his tired mind to
study his apathetic beaten father dead of
malaria the farm given up his sister mar-
ried himself working out as a hired man
at scrawny seventeen then his drifting
from job to job-up to tarrant county
for a time at denison helping to grade
the railway-line north through the indian
country driving a scraper team and hear-
ing vague tales of buried treasure more
realistic tales of gold in colorado and his
first adventure as a tramp beating his way
to denver his disappointing toil as a nov-
ice pick-miner work in the steaming mud of
irrigated fields in the valley of the arkan-
sas his return-robust if still undersized
now-to texas and the scenes of his boy-
hood to gain touch again with his sister
and her family and spend his accumulated
two hundred dollars

clow moves these-dragging across
twelve years since he had left home
his sister he had found with a brood of six
children undernourished sun-bleached of
hair shy-himself as a boy all over again
he had loaned his brother-in-law all but
fifty dollars of his savings to buy clothes
for his wife and children a double-shovel
cultivator a new cook-stove he had re-
explored the bird creek woods gone swim-
ming in the old water-holes with elbert
cobbett his eleven-year-old nephew but
had failed to recapture the old sense of ad-
venture

  but then to reward him for this effort
to reestablish family ties he had met sue
shady-dear puzzling little sue young
silent wise with deep deep blue eyes a
sensitive face cream-tinted and changeful
as a mountain dawn and a smile that
wasnt for what you said or did but came
from some stimulus of your personality-
the way you had of smoothing the cow-
lick of hair behind your right ear for in

stance he had seen her first at a sunday
afternoon singing to which he had taken
nellie his sisters ten-year-old girl nel-
lie had cuddled up to sue had swung from
her hand as they left had appealed to him
kin i walk part way home with
teacher uncle jack

  sue had held out her white little hand
gravely and said

  i reckon youre uncle jack miller
from colorado she had smiled only after
he had taken her hymn-book and saw him
fluttering its leaves embarrassed

  she boarded with mrs andrews a mile
from cobbetts she had come from dallas
to teach the small bird creek school her
mother had died a year before her father
was a locomotive engineer on the t p
and she was eighteen-a simple history
uncomplicated as the gaze she turned upon
him when she became interested in his talk
she had a trick of listening absorbedly
and noncommittally to his stories provok-
ing him to continue only by quick upward
glances that seemed to say go on
surely there was a sequel

it had been a glorious month the one

	which followed their meeting late af-
ternoons saturdays and sundays they had
watched together a years ripening amidst
nipping frosts languid sunshine falling red-
and-gold of pointed sumach leaves squir-
rels busy in the hickory trees hackberries
blackening pecan-nut husks opening to
spill their smooth brown treasures the
death of a year but the conception rapid
gestation and birth of love

  why jack you want to kiss me sure
enough sue had held his coat-lapels and
looked long searchingly into his eyes sat-
isfied she had lowered her head and a
lovely tide of color had flooded her cheeks
the kiss had sealed her vow jack i
will be yours as long as the light that is
now in your eyes shall endure

  they had planned he had boasted

  i bet i can strike it rich out there in
colorado a man i know wants me to
throw in with him next spring an go
prospectin over into the san juan moun-
tains wed hit for the gulches early an
stay till snow flies-if we didnt strike it
 but say theres gold in them
mountains an we can find it

  yes she had agreed there is gold
 and you wouldnt want to be a
tenant-farmer would you jack

  look at bill cobbett an sister may

the blue



  yes folks are different have

different dreams dont they jack
thats it sue youve hit it now
ive got to range them gold hills

  i couldnt go with you jack she
had laid her hand on his arm and lifted
her challenging blue eyes to his

  you he had described the prospec-
tors existence in a mans world of grinding
toil scant rations hard living in giving
up the dream she had smiled

  id love to see you mixing what you call
sour-dough bread jack presently she
had asked

  when do you expect-but of course

you cant tellwell never mind

youll come for me when you can
simply trustfully said expressing sue

  god i wish i could take you you
will wait sue useless frantic query

  yes i can you see-i can go right
along teaching

ite had gone away returned to colorado

	a to raise the necessary stake before join-
ing his friend in the spring he had fed
alfalfa and beet-pulp to cattle brought
down from mountain ranges to winter in
the arkansas valley

  sues letters had nourished his love
news of his sisters family flashes of school
life-johnny hicks found a hens nest
under the schoolhouse wednesday with
six eggs and we boiled them in a tomato
can on the heating stovemrs an-
drews bachelor brother is staying at the
house for a while-hes been on a ranch

out in fannin county oh jack

i wish-dont let any of those wild cows
chew a finger off while youre feeding them
 i love you-god keep you jack 
spring-and ten months of isolation
maddening gaps between letters three lost
to one received ten months of unre-
warded toil then back to steady work and
wages and regular mail at rocky ford
sue had secured a bigger school and better
pay at willow grove she had heard from
mrs andrews who had sent news of jacks
sister and as always the serene assurance
of her unwavering love her implicit faith in
his own loyalty her belief in his golden
dream

  another long spring and summer in the
mountains followed with a partner who
sought a specific mine-the lost jaybird
snow had driven them forth as the indica-
tions grew more and more promising his
gold-crazed partner had ventured to return
book magazine



in the winter alone and had been hauled
out by a state snow-observer frozen and
at the point of death jack had got work
in denver in order to be near him in hos-
pital he had died in february with some
last muttered words about the jaybird
hard times had struck denver jack was
put on part time lonely discouraged he
had been ready to go back to his old cat-
tle-feeding job when he met kuhns they
had spent afternoons and evenings in talk
-curious discursive up-and-down-the-
highways-and-byways sort of talk he had
moved to kuhns boarding-house met
dempsey the mexican and young rogers
-all men who worked sometimes gambled
steadily loafed drank and raised old
harry in the citys sin-patches

vveek by week under kuhns careful
 questioning jacks story of the quest
of the jaybird grew more alluring spring
past the four men had got together an out-
fit and agreed to follow his leadership
they had worked over the ground eagerly
up and down the short canon nothing
worth while had turned up they had
topped the ridge and were working down
the other slope when they went into camp
at aspen spring an old trappers rendez-
vous

  a mile below the crumbling cabin demp-
sey had found a bit of float they had
traced its course back and had found its
source in the very back yard of their camp
pay dirt at last they had worked hap-
pily strenuously opening their tunnel into
the hillside i they had bought much powder
-a fact that hagens agent lon casey
had soon learned

  casey had come secretly to talk he
had come again to make an offer for the
claim-ten thousand dollars kuhns had
laughed jeeringly casey had come again
and on his third visit hagen himself ac-
companied him

  if you boys are sports the heavy-
shouldered shaggy and be-diamonded old
mine-owner proposed get together and
write on a piece of paper what you think
you ought to get ill put down on another
paper what i honestly think your prospects
worth-and well see about splitting the
difference kuhns had held out for fifty
thousand dollars apiece while hagen of-
fered fourteen thousand dollars and after
much discussion thirty-two thousand dol-
lars had been agreed upon

  miller had suggested that they should

by john m oskison

retain an interest but hagens terms were
all or none and kuhns had said

  send the cash and papers well be
waiting and now-

jow he was on his last trip up the trail
from the section-house with a letter
from sue in his pocket-dear funny sue
she had written

  about this time you ought to be getting
your second hair-cut of the season dont
let them spoil that cowlick in the brief
reply he had penciled and sent he had said
nothing about the sale of the claim he
would save the news until he could lay the
money in sues lap cry hows that for a
starter and taste the joy of her joy he
had only dropped a hint

  hows the pecan-crop this year i may
show up down there before theyre all
gone

  he had justified sues sure faith in his
star now he would leave these men with
whom he could have nothing in common he
would bank his money at rocky ford and
look around for an alfalfa ranch on the
arkansas river he would raise cattle-he
liked working with cattle sue should live
in a new house keep a hired girl drive a
car-dogged if i dont think its goin to
be like the song says about that beautiful
land where no storms ever beat on the
glittering strand 

tiagens lawyer with casey and two
trusted guards came with the papers
and the money-five compact packages of
yellow-backed treasury notes neatly
wrapped in waterproof covers thirty-one
thousand dollars in each and five small
bags of gold each containing fifty twenty-
dollar pieces-for expenses till you can
get out to the bank the lawyer explained
the money was paid over counted and
apportioned the good fairies stayed for
dinner then departed to catch the after-
noon train kuhns dempsey fonda and
rogers broke out a new deck of cards and
started a poker game-a surprisingly mod-
erate game miller reflected idly when at
supper-time the heaviest loser was able to
settle with a five-dollar bill after cards
the four sat in a row against the cabin
and shot at a mark-target practice in-
tended for psychological effect on miller
who heard dempsey call out

  throw one of them cans up an let me
take a crack at it in the air he heard
kuhns loud comment
upon the lion and adder

  i bet you twenty you cant hit it again 
dempseys gun barked and kuhns ac-
knowledged disgustedly all right you
win they were kidding kuhns as they
came into the cabin in response to millers
call and sat down to supper

  at sunrise next morning miller woke
with the impression that though he had
awakened later than usual he had really
only slept a brief hour not suspicion of
his partners however had made him wake-
ful it was the surging sense of anticipated
happiness that had delayed slumber until
after one oclock in the morning

  he had then sunk deep into unconscious-
ness kuhns had held a lighted candle
close to his eyes before gently shifting his
shoulders in order to open the vest into
the inside pocket of which miller had
stuffed the currency package the little
bag of gold was under the coat that served
as pillow

  miller woke to find the others up facing
him yawning scratching pulling on boots
-and each with pistol belted under vest
they watched miller intently as he rose to
a sitting position in the bunk they saw
him grin sleepily saw his hand lift to
the vest pocket saw the swift signal of
alarm in his eyes saw his hand fumble
about in the blankets saw him lift and
shake out his coat and saw his eyes come
round to their faces

  y-y-ou b-boys- millers voice stut-
tered s-say d-d-did you do it for a
j-j-joke

  whats matter miller kuhns grinned
insolently across at him

  m-m-my m-m-money-its g-gone

  ah quit yer kiddin-how the hell
could yer money git lost jeered demp-
sey

lyiiller settled to a frantic prolonged
 study of the others faces all too
plainly presently the truth showed in
dempseys exaggerated grin in young
rogers sudden lowering of his eyes and
nervous gesture toward his pistol

  say was it a joke millers voice
had steadied hardened dont keep it
up boys-its too damned hard on a fel-
low kuhns rose threateningly

  look here miller dont make any ugly
cracks at us we aint got your money if
youve been robbed it was by somebody
else-go and find him we dont play
jokes

  millers eyes went red from the sudden

the blue

rush of blood driven by hot anger he
whirled to grab his pistol fumbled for it
unsuccessfully and turned with a snarl to
the others a pallor of despair graying his
cheeks

  scared of me was you he taunted
kuhns laughed and tossed his own pistol
on millers bunk as dempsey surrepti-
tiously loosed the handle of his weapon in
its holster millers eyes caught the subtle
play and he handed back the pistol

  not today he jeered and then ad-
dressed them deliberately

  boys i know you took my money if
youre goin to give it back all right-
there wont be no hard feelins if you
aint- he hesitated and then cried
shrilly are you

  havent i told you we aint got it
kuhns reiterated menacingly

  well miller finished speaking with a
steady effort at concentration and calm em-
phasis im up against it nowbut ill get
that money back or ill get every damn one
of you i mean that

  phut-torrero fonda laughed rose
and went to make a fire in the rusty camp
stove as kuhns and rogers passed out of
the cabin to go and splash water from the
little stream on their faces miller heard
the youth swear whiningly as he accidently
raked his sore hand across a stone demp-
sey sat quite still the holster of his pistol
cuddled in his lap-the attitude of a will-
ing executioner miller thought

  they got my money and theyd get me
too at the slightest excuse but not today
my bullies he got up from his bunk
deliberately and followed to the brook
dempsey trailed him squatting ten feet
away to worry a shock of tousled iron-gray
hair with dripping fingers at fondas call
come an get eet-eet is hot miller
went in and took his accustomed place

  he finished his breakfast in silence and
rose kuhns said in the tone of one of-
fering charity

  miller heres a hundred dollars-we
dont like to see you leave broke he
shoved five gold-pieces across the table
toward him miller shoved the money back
to kuhns and started for the door bet-
ter take it miller kuhns urged he
laughed take it as the first installment
of what you think we owe you an come
back any time for the rest

  all or none kuhns-an some day itll
be all millers words came back over
his shoulder as he set off down the trail to
book magazine

the section-house out of his sight and hear-
ing the others followed to see him climb
into the caboose of a flagged freight train
before they returned to divide the stolen
thirty-two thousand dollars amongst them-
selves

jviillers was a memory that retained
appropriate fragments of sentences
expressive words and phrases he liked to
repeat such to himself savor their mean-
ings their connotations without troubling
himself about their origins and the contexts
out of which they had been pried one of
these-a sonorous phrase-crowded to his
lips as he plodded slowly down the trail
its syllables adjusted themselves to the
deliberate rhythm of his marching

  one-two-three-four ven-geance
-is-mine ven-geance-is-mine ven-
geance-is-mine and on and on
in the caboose he heard it again in quicker
rhythm in the thumping click of wheels
passing over rail-joints a brakeman who
had talked in a desultory way found
miller on the back platform as the sun
went behind the mountains he offered
to share the contents of a lunch-bucket
but miller looked at him and shook his
head-he was too completely absorbed by
the song of the wheels the quick and cheer-
ful promise of iron on iron ven-geance
-is-mine ven-geance-is-mine

  and then strangely miller felt the
ryhthm incomplete after the four expected
beats he tried to fit something else-and
couldnt the train pulled in to a siding
the brakeman got off and miller lay prone
upon the bench along the side of the ca-
boose he must try to fill in the hiatus
oh yes he must begin to consider the
future too the sound of the engines
slow panting came to him through the over-

sense miller rose went to the back
platform he dropped to the cinders beside
the track and looked round on one side
a water-tank a section-house with a nar-
row strip of garden and two boxes of
geraniums in the windows two hundred
yards away across an irrigating ditch on
the other side of the track a man was cut-

by john m oskison



-is-mine  its clatter was unintelligible
cheerful offering no suspended rhythms
good

  heres where i quit you miller said
suddenly to the brakeman who had come
back to stand beside him he swung up
the steps seized his bed-roll and climbed
down

  hey your fares paid to tres bocas-
what about it

  tell the conductor to keep the change 
miller called as he tramped off toward the
hay-field to himself he muttered

  i expect i can get work here i wouldnt
wonder if i could anyway he added in
his thoughts he would get away from that
maddening unfinished and hammering
phrase and win a chance to think and plan

  sure agreed the farmer glad to see
you you bet ill give you a job go
on over to the house ill be quittin in a
few minutes an well have supper af-
ter supper miller went down to the track
to watch a train go by if possible he
wanted to make sure that his despoilers
went back to denver-where he guessed
they would go but it was not until next
morning that they passed as he lay in a
ditch near the track miller saw kuhns on
the platform of the caboose of a cattle-train
eastbound smoking a cigarette his vest
buttoned perfunctorily rubbing his back
against a brake-post

  denver bound all right bullies ill be
along soonj

rthat night in his blankets beside a
new stack of hay miller set his mem-
ory to work reconstructing the fabric of
his life with kuhns and the others recall-
ing the substance and color of kuhns con-
versations and reminiscences-for he was
certain that the man would hold dempsey
fonda and rogers under his leadership un-
til their money was gone at least that
long hed probably allow a brief fling
in denver after the necessary preliminary
scouting to make certain that miller had
not preceded them and then prudently
he would head them toward some other
field where what clues to kuhns in-
terests his dreams had he ever let escape

  kuhns had told surprisingly little about
his life before miller yielded himself to
sleep he had recalled only scattered frag-
ments of the others self-revelations next
day in the hay he dismissed the search
from his mind working steadily and intel-
ligently to accumulate the little stake he
upon the lion and adder



the blue

must have before he could formulate any
sort of plan at night as he faced the
stars and felt the cool singing wind on his
face he resumed the search for any remem-
bered significant speech that would indi-
cate kuhns probable next move

  not until the third night when he had
carried his methodical memory-researches
up to the moment when dempsey had lum-
bered hastily up the creek with the rich
fragment of ore did miller catch a gleam
then he recalled kuhns intent study of
the bit of rock his deliberate look round
upon them his vehement warning not a
word about this boys and the following
moment of expansiveness

  when we clean up here boys-
miller could recall the exultant tone of his
voice-i want you to come with me i
know where to go for more-a long ways
from here kuhns had seemed to lose
himself in a pleasing vision had said no
more-at that time but later miller
plodded on and on the fourth evening of
his researches he came to the time when
they had all sat against the wall of the
cabin after supper and somebody had said

  i wish to hell them pinons would get
ripe pronto probably it had been fonda
after a little while kuhns had said

  you dont see pinons down on the
spavinaw plenty of pines but not pinons
aint that funny then again weeks later
when a batch of bread had disgusted his
taste cornbreads what i hanker for
made out of white corn ground by a water-
mill and baked by a good-looking cherokee
indian woman im goin to have it some
day in a neat little old log cabin on the
banks of the spavinaw-one of the clear-
est sweetest streams god ever set run-
ning 

lviiller knew of the spavinaw had
heard a good bit about it from some
of the boys on the grading job years ago
who had fished its waters their chief
interest however had been in the half-
whispered stories of buried treasure some-
where on its banks-gold from old texas
when it was part of spanish mexico buried
by a closely pursued party of raiders from
missouri just before a fight with mexican
troops in which all but one of the raiders
were killed this survivor wounded in the
head had told of the treasure but had
died before he could lead the way to its
location

  if kuhns knew the spavinaw he would

also know about the buried-treasure story
he might even believe it and have worked
out in his mind some plan for recovering
the gold with the help of dempsey fonda
and rogers miller remembered that the
indians of the spavinaw country had run
various treasure hunters out of the neigh-
borhood they took no stock in the story
and suspected prying whites who came to
dig of a design to rob them of their homes

  perhaps kuhns would rent a farm the
four would work it live quietly hunt fish
and make friends ar-ong the indians-at
any rate it was what miller thought a logi-
cal procedure its the best lead i can
figure out he said to himself and when
the haying job was over he drew his wages
and went on he wrote to sue

  well dear im held up here in denver
for a while i expect i wont get down for
any pecans maybe ill be in time for the
barbecue next fourth

  he found that the boys had indeed cel-
ebrated for two weeks spending recklessly
and leaving broad traces of having painted
the town red and then disappeared
miller secured a daytime job as a drayman
and worked at odd jobs in saloons in the
evenings in order to gather as many clues
as to kuhns plans as he could he found
the woman with whom kuhns had lived
during his brief stay and evenings he ac-
quired the habit of ending up at josies
buying beer and gossiping with her about
his experiences and her acquaintances
josie developed an interest in miller as a
new type-a feller from the hills that
dont try to git fresh his coolness piqued
her and from wondering what his game
was she began to plan little pleasures for
miller from casual words dropped in
planned sequence josie came to know that
he wanted to find kuhns-and destroy
him knowing she brought him an old
folded newspaper

   dutchy left that here she said care-
lessly he used to study these here a
good deal she put her finger on a
smeared column advertising farms for sale
maybe thatll give you a lead he aint
never wrote to me

  it was the delaware county item
among the advertisements were such as
sixty acres in cultivation double log
house tight barn one mi w of eucha on
the spavinaw forty acres good spring
peach orchard half mi from spavinaw
p o

  thanks said miller pinching her arm
book magazine



playfully what do you say to some more
beer he drank and as he left queried
facetiously want to send a message to
dutchy

  come early tomorrow she urged ig-
noring the question but he never saw her
again

defore he dropped down into okla-

  homa on a haying job late in june he
had worn out a winter and spring in den-
ver down on the arkansas river in feed-
lots and beet-fields and in the young corn-
fields of kansas he timed his arrival in
the neighborhood of the spavinaw to jibe
with the season of slack farm-work and
leisure for hunting-squirrels or buried
treasure

  as miller crossed the line from kansas
into oklahoma the sense of his approach
to his reckoning with kuhns-for he had
a serene faith that he should find him on
the spavinaw-set going again the long-
stilled refrain ven-geance-is-mine
ven-geance-is-mine now however
it neither confused nor troubled him
rather it was as a song on his lips the
pleasant flexing of the muscles before
striking

there had been an interchange of tele-
grams and sue was at the little willow
grove station in her trim new two-seater
as miller descended from the train and
looked round like a man bewildered

   this way mister she called joyously
he turned his head to gape at her-a deli-
ciously cool defiance of the early july heat
in her drooping wide straw hat white lawn
her bare brown forearms stretched across
the steering wheel carrying a new yel-
low valise he stumbled forward and be-
fore he reached her he had succeeded in
breaking the rigid lines of strain that had
distorted his face

  gosh sue he offered her a twisted
grin shifted the valise to his left hand and
held out his right

  oh jack she gave him both of her
hands-cool sweet possessive get in
my dear she whispered i want to kiss
-oh youve had another hair-cut as
she leaned impulsively to touch the line of
white under his ear between the deep tan
of his neck and his black hair she looked
closely into his face his eyes-and a sharp
pain went through her heart it was lined
set ashen under the sun-tan his eyes
had lost the old warm gray serenity they

by john m oskison

seemed overlarge too rounded with a false
brilliancy shifting involuntarily their
sockets had sunk and dark patches showed
underneath

  get in quick my dear well take a
little drive sue spoke as calmly as she
could watching him settle awkwardly into
the seat and draw the yellow valise onto
his lap she started the little car and soon
swung into a road that flowed under the
cool shade of sycamores edging willow
branch in an open space under the trees
she pulled up with an obvious effort
miller swung his head round blinked the
set stare out of his eyes and unclenched
his jaws he reached across the valise to
take sues cheeks into the parenthesis of
his rough palms

  god sue it is you my dear my
dear pure melodrama thought sue-
real melodrama spoken in an overvibrant
voice that was resisting the break that
should end some frightful tension it ter-
rified her but quickly she gave her lips
and her arms went round his neck her
lips to his ear she whispered

  of course jack my dear and happy
to have you-at last jack you wont ever
leave me again

  no by god youre mine they cant
-youre mine sue youre mine aint
you sue this was approaching hysteria
and sue tried lowering the key by raillery
as she twisted her hands caressingly in his
grasp

  why did you tarry so long jack im
an old maid-almost do you realize ill be
twenty-one tomorrow he looked at her
curiously broke into a harsh laugh

  huh im already thirty-one celebrated
my birthday ten days ago he turned
his head from her suddenly as if to gather
courage for his next strident laugh and
challenge

  say sue i cant marry an old maid
sue took his rough hands drew them to
the tender curve of her throat and looked
searchingly into his face compelling his
darting eyes to come to rest in her own

  i dont know what it is jack she
whispered but i believe you need me very
desperately do you he nodded and
let the mask settle over his face do you
think sue went on softly this would be
all right for a wedding-dress jack

  what today now oh can you
sue

  of course jack she laughed after
all it isnt so sudden is it
upon the lion and adder

a ll through the day miller moved and
 spoke as an automaton while sue in
growing alarm at her powerlessness to break
through the numbing crust of him carried
him over the ceremony the dinner at her
boarding-house and the adieus to her
friends as she drove north to sherman as
he took up the pen to sign the hotel reg-
ister she pressed his arm and whispered
mr and mrs jackson miller rocky
ford colorado he wrote it slowly

  at bedtime as sue laid out her night-
things under the steady if uncomprehend-
ing stare of her new husband she chal-
lenged gayly

  what treasures have you in your bag
jack he turned abruptly to draw the
yellow valise up on his knees

  oh-well ill show you he drew two
heavy pistols out first and laid them care-
fully on the floor beside his chair sue
touched them gingerly with her foot
jack are they loaded

  sure now look here he held out
a bulging parcel in stained oilcloth cover
and a buckskin bag sue put out her
hands

  lookout that ones heavy the bag
fell from her grasp clinked dully on the
carpet and sue cried

  gold miller nodded she unwrapped
the parcel slowly stared at the banded
packages of currency fluttered a sheaf of
loose notes handed it back

  oh jack all this-riches why i
had no idea- how much is it

  thirty thousand in bills twenty-six
hundred in gold he turned burning eyes
upon her and spoke vehemently

  its what i went for sue its enough
-its yours i got it for that mine i wrote
you about-just got it ten days ago on
my birthday wasnt that a birthday
present didnt tell you before-a sur-
prise his voice trailed off into surpris-
ing accents of misery he rose took up the
money and pistols and went to turn back
a pillow

  ill sleep on this side he announced
dully replacing the pillow

cue woke with a shock terror contract-
 ing her heart paralyzing her limbs
miller was sitting upright in bed a pistol
in each hand seeming to search the ob-
scurity of the room with swinging glance
savagely almost incoherently he cried be-
tween clenched teeth

  there they are there they are he

the blue

raised both pistols sue closed her eyes and
shrank gaspingly but there was no shot
and sue opened her eyes to see him put
down the pistols and cover his face with
his hands his voice came broken tragic

 thats it-thats it oh god

i didnt know saith the lord-

saith the lord-thats it vengeance is
mine saith the lord  oh oh
he sat rocking back and forth slowly mut-
tering unintelligible laments trembling
with infinite caution sue got out of bed
and lifted the heavy pistols carefully from
the sheet and put them on the floor she
knelt on the bed beside him took his
hands and quieted the convulsive working
of his fingers against the velvet of her
cheeks when he became quiet she shook
him and called insistently

  jack jack dear wake up

  all right sue he stared sleepily
wonderingly as she went to snap on the
light over the rickety black writing-table
she came back to sit on the edge of the
bed where she could study the lines of his
dream-tortured face

  jack i want to talk to you-help you
if i can she captured one of his hands
to hold the nervous fingers to her cheek
you have been horribly frightened by a
nightmare i was scared terribly-when
you sat up with the pistols i took them
away you swore seemed fright-
ened and suffering

  yes i know miller interrupted dis-
mally its a regular performance this

is the tenth night god im wore

out with it sue

  what is it jack what brings it on
will you tell me and let me help

  he sat for a long time eyes down his
free fingers twisting and pleating the
sheet his other hand held caressingly on
her knee sue waited at length he lifted
his eyes and began to talk and as he
talked she sat immobile-except that her
fingers went on caressing his hand

jviiller told then coherently quietly
the story of the mine of the robbery
by his companions his despair and the
pursuit threading through the narrative
that insistent reiterated phrase which had
hammered away at his consciousness

  seemed like i couldnt get it out of my
head-vengeance is mine reckon i
didnt want to sue for it suited my case
 i intended to take vengeance on
them that had robbed me
book magazine



  so i followed em into oklahoma and
got a job at a hay-camp near grove i
found out where they had rented a farm
close to the spavinaw west of eucha and
i moved on to beattys prairie ten days
ago i quit my job an went in to the little
town of jay it was a saturday afternoon
an nearly everybody from around there
had come to town i dodged here an
there an finally i spotted kuhns loafin
on a comer-didnt seem to have anything
to say to anybody just waitin around i
thought that was kind o funny after a
while i saw dempsey an rogers together
-rogers had a white rag tied around his
hand itd been sore for a long time i
spotted the mexican too-wearin spurs

i waited an nearly sundown kuhns an
dempsey an rogers went to hitch up a
team-theyd brought a load of stovewood
in an sold it-and fonda got on his horse

i jumped into a wagon that pulled out be-
hind them-bummed a ride from a big fat
indian pretty soon he told me-i didnt
ask any questions-about kuhns an the
other fellows said he thought they was
fixin to pull out hadnt done very well
an the old fat rascal kind o winked at
me as if he thought i understood why
theyd come to the spavinaw

  i quit the indian at a side road-told
him i was headin for chloeta i trailed
into eucha after dark got my bearins an
pushed on across the hills i waded the
spavinaw an struck a dim wood-road up
through the timber to a clearin the moon
was out an i saw a light in the window
of the log cabin that stood in the middle
of the clearin i waited till the lamp
went out before i sneaked up in the
shadow of the wagon that was settin out
maybe twenty yards from the cabin i
was afraid thered be a dog-i wonder why
they didnt have a dog miller hesitated
rubbed his free hand across his eyes he
went on at sues pressure of his fingers

  well anyhow-i made sure of the place
by lookin the wagon over an i sat there
with my back against a wheel tryin to
think an plan what to do i sat there a
long time maybe it was till midnight-
the moon was gettin pretty well over to
the west-an yet i didnt have any plan
worked out for gettin them an then i
saw the door of the cabin open i dropped
flat-lucky i was in the shadow of the
wagon it was kuhns that came out an
he started sneakin across the clearin
toward the east hed got nearly to the

by john m oskison

timber an i was about to get up an fol-
low when fonda came out an started off
on kuhns track before hed got out of
sight here came dempsey an rogers to-
gether-i could see the white rag plain on
rogers hand

  i begun to figure then an figure fast
an i hit the facts theyd hid what
money they had-what they had left from
sellin the mine an robbin me-over there
in the woods somewhere an kuhns had
made up his mind to sneak out an take
it hopin he could make his get-away
maybe fonda had the same idea an
dempsey an rogers had stayed awake to
keep tabs on them two-nobody trustin
anybody any more nobody able to get a
nights sleep wasnt that a hell of a mess

  looked to me like thered be some
grand mix-up mighty soon if id figured
right an it was up to me to get into it
so i got up loosened the gun in my hol-
ster an started out to trail dempsey an
rogers when i got to the woods i had
to go awful slow but i finally made out
the white rag on rogers hand-it was his
right hand-an i got up pretty close by
keepin trees between them an me they
got to the edge of a little open space an
stopped so i laid down an got to a place
from where i could look across that moon-
lit open space a little ways out from the
trees i saw a sort of dark bump that
moved just a little bit-fonda crawlin
forward maybe fifty feet in front of him
was a big rock with a patch of brush close
beside it an somethin was stirrin the
tops of the bushes thats kuhns i said
to myself an pretty soon he stood up
clear of the bushes sort of hunched over
as if he had both hands full of somethin

then there was a spurt of fire pur-
sued miller from the black hump
in the grass fonda had taken good aim
an kuhns slumped down the mexican
waited a few seconds listenin an then run
to the rock stooped over gathered some-
thin into his hands an stood up he
looked round then started off-away from
the cabin i could wait for the next move
i figured an sure enough i saw dempsey
step out into the moonlight an drop to one
knee he called out to fonda hey
mex an as the fellow stopped for a
second he let him have it-a clean cool
shot from a rest over his knee fonda fell
down on his face an dempsey got up to
his feet slowlike to walk forward
upon the lion and adder

  next i saw rogers-his white rag-
wrapped hand dodgin about-tryin to get
a bead on dempsey a-ha i said to my-
self its a case of the last man alive
takin the pot i reckon but i didnt
have any confidence in rogers marksman-
ship so i took aim from where i lay an
cracked down on dempsey it was passin
through my mind vengeance is mine
an i said to myself itll be mine too sure
as hell

  dempsey spun around cussin damn
you rogers he yelled of course he
thought rogers had got him an then he
fired at rogers before he tumbled but
rogers had jumped behind a tree at my
shot an was tryin to make out where i
was layin i didnt make another move
or sound but just lay watchin the white
bandage on rogers hand- i expect hed
forgot he had it on his hand

  he dropped down to the ground an
i saw that little patch of white sort of
creep out an come to rest i knew he was
listenin-an wonderin do you reckon he
thought about me then kind o looks to
me like he might miller looked up hope-
fully at sue she nodded and pressed his
fingers

  well he continued i figured how
he was layin an fired the bullet he sent

in answer went well over my head

everything was still in a minute an i got
up an walked on past rogers an demp-
sey to the rock fondas death-

grip on the money was hard to break
 kuhns lay all huddled up hands
on his stomach like

  i walked off through the timber with
what kuhns had dug out from under a flat
stone in the bushes got to the bank of the
spavinaw an stopped to rest-an see what
id got i could just make out to count it
in the moonlight just six hundred dollars
more than theyd robbed me of-gosh may-
be you think i wasnt pleased at that
mine plus interest i thought to myself
i was thinkin now ive got to make
tracks out of here darn soon when all of
a sudden-all of a sudden that old bible
sayin came into my mind an blotted every-
thing else out it kept on an on venge-
ance is mine vengeance is mine

   well all right i tried to say to my-
self it is mine an then the strain i
reckon was too much i fell over-fainted
i reckon i woke up i dont know how
much later an above the noise of the
spavinaw water rushin along over the

the blue

rocks it seemed like somebody was shoutin
in my ear vengeance is mine saith the
lord see saith the lord-like that
over an over hammerin it into my ears
then came the rest i will repay its
been like that ever since sue them words
that i cant get out of my head vengeance
is mine saith the lord i will repay

  ive been through hell sue why

  go on jack she whispered

  i tried to sleep there in the woods to
get back my nerve i laid down under a
pine tree close to spavinaw water an shut
my eyes i reckon i went to sleep an i
saw them four-the white rag on rogers
hand as plain as anything-come walkin
across the water right at me no sound
no splashin-right at me

ceemed to me like i emptied my pistol
at em an they faded away i woke up
with the pistol in my hand four loads still
in it an knew i hadnt fired for fear
i might i threw the pistol into the water
i wrapped the money in my coat made a
roll of the coat an plodded off west to hit
the railroad at salina early in the mornin
i hopped a train for muskogee went an
got somethin to eat an took a room at a
roomin-house i hid the money under the
mattress an went out to walk the streets
till bedtime next mornin a fel-
low that had the next room caught me in
the hall an said say friend you sure
raised hell in there last night-dont you
know these partitions are mighty thin i
reckon i did make a fuss too-seemed like
bein without a gun laid me open to them
-spirits or ghosts or whatever they are

  i changed to another roomin-house
hopin i could get rid of them an get a
chance to think an plan-think what i
was goin to do about the money-an about
you sue there was a piece in the paper
about kuhns an the rest bein found shot
an the other paper next day came out
with the story that theyd been killed in
a midnight battle amongst themselves-
told how theyd been known as buried-
treasure hunters how kuhns had evidently
thought hed found the place beside the
big rock an had begun to dig when the
battle started how fonda had shot kuhns
dempsey had shot fonda an how rogers
had got dempsey whod managed to get
rogers with a dyin snap-shot people
were flockin from all around to dig up the
ground for a hundred yards on every side
of the big rock
book magazine

  looked like i was clean free but i
couldnt sleep just the same without
theyd come marchin in-not sayin any-
thing but solemn an pointin to me next
day i bought these two guns an moved
on down to mcalester to another roomin-
house i put the guns under my pillow
    time after time theyd come in
through the door an id dream i was
shootin em down but id wake up an

find my guns still loaded all around

i changed roomin-houses again an then
i went on to krebs an stayed there two
days no good i was gettin desperate
without any proper sleep with them
cornin in regular an with that everlastin
sayin out of the bible hammerin an ham-
merin away inside of my head

  it got so that i could hardly think-
even of you sue so at durant i sent off
that telegram before id lost my mind an
-well here we are

  i reckon i figured if i could get to you
sue i could explain it to you an you
could help me get rid of them but when
i saw you at the depot in the hot sunshine
lookin so happy an sweet an real it just
seemed like i couldnt talk about them
i said to myself if i can keep sue by
me they wont dare to come an i can
get some sleep again-sleep without havin
them come at me i wont need to say
anything to sue but-

  they came tonight the same as theyve
been cornin an same as ever that old
bible sayin kept on tormentin me-kept
on repeatin itself vengeance is mine
saith the lord 

viiller turned a stricken face to sue
and put out his other hand toward her
his voice becoming utterly tragic

  i know why they come an why that
sayin keeps on poundin on my brain-ah
i know sue when i made up my mind to
kill them fellows i was undertakin to do
the lords work when i shot dempsey an
rogers-an id have shot kuhns an
fonda too if id had the chance-i did
what the lord had promised to do there
in the bible an im bein punished sue

  look how the lord dealt with kuhns
an fonda hed have done the same with
the other two if i hadnt

  oh whatll i do sue go up there
an tell the sheriff give up to the law
in the dim glow of the light from the writ-
ing-table millers eyes seemed to sue like
flaming interrogation marks

by john m oskison



  with a terrific effort-a literal heave of
her aching shoulders-sue threw off the
weight of binding horror that had held her
immobile she leaned to press her cheek
against millers then got off the bed she
stood for a minute hands over her eyes
thinking striving to recall something that
she had once heard-where at last it
came back to her and she sat down on the
edge of the bed again

  jack she said quietly lets see just
where you stand-her voice dropped
almost to a whisper-with the lord you
shot the man dempsey who was a mur-
derer you shot rogers who had murder
in his heart-who tried to kill dempsey
and you got back what belonged to you
she sat silent for a little while

  im a christian jack she went on
at least i believe i am i know the lords

promise to repay and i believe it

it would torment you dear-horribly
but i want you to pay close attention to

this jack wait she walked

swiftly to the writing-table and took up the
gideon bible under the light she flipped
its pages rapidly found what she sought
she returned to the bed put the book down
and holding one of millers hands to her
breast cried softly

  listen my dear and she read

   thou shalt tread upon the lion and
adder the young lion and the serpent
shalt thou trample under foot you see
jack sue raised her eyes exultant and
whispered he meant you to do it
she crushed the captive hand fiercely
against the round softness of her flesh
and listen again

   thou shalt not be afraid for the terror
by night dont you see jack truly
vengeance is mine saith the lord but
he must have an instrument see my
dear you were his instrument

  miller fingered the book which she had
given opened into his hands awkwardly
presently he smiled and then the hard
lines of terror the deep scars of self-tor-

ture seemed to break and disappear

and then a sleepy boyish face was laid
against sues shoulder he muttered
apologetically

  i reckon i never did read enough of
that book sue his head fell forward
he recovered with a faint happy grin and
said contentedly glad i came to you

sue-my dear

  she lowered his head to the pillow and
he slept-a profound dreamless sleep

there is naturally more of a luncheon and
dinner attendance than at other times in
this diplomatic club but there are other
evenings when the rooms are filled with
members who seem to have happened in by
chance it was during one of this sort
when three celebrated men dropped in for
a late supper after leaving a reception in
belgravia-no longer by the way the ex-
clusive section it was

  earl trevor of dyvnaint earl lammer-
ford of st ives and sir abdool mohammed
khan g c s i are possibly among the
hundred best known and best liked men in
europe yet a curious thing is notice-
able in the case of each one whether he is
by himself or with the other two with
most celebrities there is a general turning
of heads a focusing of attention upon

them as they enter a room filled with other
people they attract and desire instant
recognition they relax and bask in it
as their right with the men above-men-
tioned however it always seems as if they
had been among the guests in a room for
some time before they are recognized-and
at that the recognition is neither instan-
taneous nor general the reason for this
of course is the fact that being masters of
the art of disguise because of their many
unsuspected activities they deliberately
cultivate the ability to make themselves in-
conspicuous-in some such way as this

  a person who has never given any at-
tention to that sort of thing is recognizable
even more by the unconscious movements
of his head body and limbs-with his back
turned-than by a square front view of his
face an unaccustomed expression of sur-
prise rage annoyance extreme pleasure
mirth will often change the features suf-
ficiently to make them unfamiliar to those
who know the person very well but the
shrug of a shoulder which has become by
long habit a definite mannerism the twitch
of a limb or hand the unconscious uplift-

i

ing of eyebrows while talking until the per-
son literally cant talk without doing it
rubbing the upper lip with ones forefinger
or sticking a thumb in the armhole of a
waistcoat or two fingers in a waistcoat
pocket or hands in the trousers pockets-
you catch the idea there are thousands
of these unconsciously habitual motions
well in the case of the two earls and their
afghan friend each has accentuated cer-
tain mannerisms which go with his normal
everyday appearance until he doesnt look
natural without them so complete avoid-
ance of them is mystifying at the start
and the use of totally unfamiliar manner-
isms during an occasional moment or so
clinches the deception

  take for example the case of some
friend whose marked characteristic is erect
soldierly bearing whether standing or walk-
ing whose hands are usually at his side or
one of them resting easily with the thumb
hooked in a lower waistcoat pocket whose
expression is almost invariably animated
now suppose that same person enters a
crowded room with bent head stooped
shoulders forefinger rubbing his mustache
in a thoughtful manner-preoccupied
rather slouchy would you instantly
recognize him at first glance or even
second on your life you would not
try it and see as many times as both
trevor and lammerford have entered st
james club there have been frequent oc-
casions when the footmen or pages who
took their sticks and topcoats in the hall
havent realized until it came to them with
a start sometime later just who the mem-
bers were

an the evening referred to they had
 seated themselves at a table in the grill
and ordered a light supper when lammer-
ford recalled something he wished to ask a
fellow-member if he happened to be in the
club and went off to look for him while
their order was being prepared in ten or
fifteen minutes he returned and sat down
again with the remark

  i fancy therell be a bit of high play
in the card-room this evening the span-
ish ambassador is a capital sport an all
that-plays very fair bridge an pedro
plays good poker too with any ordnry
person but theres a chap whos been
trailin about with him of late who com-
pletely outclasses him at poker-has the
type of cold deadly nerve which doesnt
go with the ambassadors temperamnt at

by clarence herbert new

all in other words don pablo plays any
game like the gentleman he is-while his
friend goldman plays to win every time
goldman is a wealthy cuban-american i
understand-a tobacco-planter with a ha-
cienda in the pinar del rio district and an
expensive house in new york

  you say hes a friend of don pablos
well the ambassador put him up for a
month at the club the man is frequently
at the embassy an appears to be in-
trested in some of the dons business af-
fairs but when they sit down for a game
of draw i fancy most of the friendship is
cut out until the game is over one hears
that goldman has won over ten thousand
pounds from his friend durin the last
week of course i dont know how wealthy
a man the don is-its supposed vaguely
that hes in comfortable circumstnces
but ten thousand quid is a good bit of
money to drop in a week-for amusement
from the way they were startin in a few
minutes ago i fancy the game will be a
stiff one this evening

  anyone else playing

  naturally two-handed poker is quite
sad as a pastime there are another
spaniard a hungarian and a german play-
ing with them not playing to lose
either

a fter finishing their supper they went
into the card-room to look on for a
while at the game of poker it appeared
that the ambassador who had been a
heavy loser was beginning to recoup some-
what he had taken in several good-sized
pots from his fellow-spaniard and the hun-
garian-which seemed to make goldman
even more determined to get these winnings
for his own pile he was playing his cards
so close to his chest that it was difficult
for the onlookers to judge what he really
held-but during one deal trevor spotted
three kings and a pair of deuces in his
hand naturally expecting to see him raise
the ante until all of the smaller fry were
frozen out don pablo had passed after
one glance at the cards dealt him-the
german and hungarian staying with what
they evidently considered strong hands
after they had raised the pot once or twice
goldman threw his full house into the dis-
card and dropped out apparently having
no further interest in that deal the hun-
garian won the pot-on three nines a few
minutes later don pablo filled a straight
and began to raise a little goldman in-
free lances in diplomacy

d

stantly came back at him and ran the bet-
ting up until the others dropped out-win-
ning with a flush which he had apparently
filled as he had drawn one card against
his friends pat hand

  in half an hour trevor was positive that
goldman was out to wan every cent the
ambassador had if he could-and was re-
peatedly throwing away good hands rather
than buck against the others even with
good chances of winning this in itself
was puzzling as the two men were pre-
sumably good friends-and wlen anything
began puzzling trevor to that extent he
rarely let the matter drop until he had
found an explanation which satisfied him
so he began watching the play of the other
men to see if there were any evidence of
conspiracy

  so far as he could judge the game was
perfectly straight-as far as collusion or
signaling between any two of the players
was concerned but he presently caught
both the german and the hungarian lay-
ing down good hands also at times when
there was a tilt between the ambassador
and goldman it is difficult even to infer
anything suspicious from such a fact how-
ever when the hands have been running
to as high percentages as they had upon
this particular evening a man may hold
a low full and yet chuck it away after a
few raises upon the conviction that there
are higher hands out against him but-
why did such cases of cold feet or pre-
monition always occur when the ambas-
sador and his friend were doing the heavi-
est betting and why didnt goldman
invariably win in such cases if he had the
cards upon one occasion he held a high
flush when don pablo was raising with
more or less confidence and simply called
at the second round the don won with a
low full-a pot too small to be very en-
couraging yet upon other occasions gold-
man had kept raising upon a high flush
until there were nearly a thousand pounds
in the pot-and won with it why should
he have been more confident at one time
than another

  from goldmans handling of the cards
there was little question but that he could
have dealt them any way he wished-if
he cared to risk disgrace which would have
driven him out of england if one or two
of the others were actually confederates
either of them could have dealt the don
a good hand and goldman a slightly bet-
ter one but watch as closely as they

the blue

might neither trevor nor his friends were
able to discover actual trickery by this
time however all of them were convinced
that the tobacco-planter was out to break
his friend financially for some obscure
reason of his own-and instead of going
home as they had intended sat watching
the game until half-past three in the morn-
ing at which time the cuban held don
pablos i-o-us for nearly fifty thousand
pounds-the don having become desperate
and plunged when the luck steadily held
against him as lammerford had said he
was a good sport-smilingly getting up
from the table with congratulations to
goldman upon his luck but his face was
several shades whiter and his manner pre-
occupied as he motored back to the em-
bassy just before daybreak

vwhen leaving the club shortly before
 the players trevor was somewhat of a
mind to shadow goldman when he left
but lammerford said

  hes stoppin at the carlton-and hes
sleepy enough to go there direct we
might be loafin about the lobby just be-
fore noon and follow him then if you like
when he goes out im in doubt as to
whether wed be wastin our time or not-
but its certain that the chap has some ob-
ject in ruining our good don pablo its
like enough to be some old vendetta which
the don has forgotten long since-some af-
fair over a woman perhaps in the years
gone by an contraire-goldman could
prove a better friend than we think him
an be merely teaching the don a lesson
not to play games of chance with men who
have a natural gift for em-to put it
politely eh what still-im suf-
ficiently intrigued over that game to probe
a bit an see if anything turns up sup-
pose we three are loafin about the carl-
ton between eleven an twelve-eh seem-
ing to be americans just over-seein the
sights what

it was past noon when goldman came

	down and breakfasted in the morning-
room two men who appeared fo know him
sauntered in while he was eating and took
a near-by table they all left the room
together-sat in the lounge for half an
hour smoking after-breakfast cigars and
discussing the stock-market then one of
them left for an appointment he had and
the other made some proposition to which
the cuban assented-calling a taxi and
book magazine



driving away with him another taxi with
three men followed it casually as if bound
in a similar direction but there was some-
thing about it which puzzled one or two
other drivers as they passed it was quite
evidently one belonging to a well-known
company by the colors in which it was
painted and the name on it-but the num-
ber was the highest any of the other driv-
ers remembered as belonging to that par-
ticular company and its chauffeur was
several shades darker than any they knew
to be driving those cabs however these
points were but momentary bits of curios-
ity-forgotten within the hour and so
cleverly did the man handle his cab dodg-
ing around this square or that to get into
the same street ahead of the one he had
been following or accurately guessing what
turns the other chauffeur was almost cer-
tain to make that he was just out of sight
around the next corner when his quarry
stopped before a quite respectable house
in chelsea

  goldman and his friend went in as if
they were quite at home-walking through
to a small study in the rear which over-
looked a garden and was evidently out of
earshot from the rest of the house each
of the three who had been following knew
some of the squares in that section of the
city between them with the large-scale
insurance-maps which were always avail-
able in trevors library they knew almost
positively what the rear of the house was
like-which gardens had doors giving upon
alleys that ran out through the near-by
mews and they decided that an attempt
to overhear the conversation between the
two men in broad daylight was practically
out of the question data as to the house
and its occupants were easily available
beyond that they were likely to pick up
circumstantial evidence by having gold-
man and the supposed house-owner shad-
owed for a few weeks-and by fitting the
various bits together dig out pretty definite
information concerning them so they
drove away upon their own affairs while
the conversation in the little study was
drifting from generalities to serious dis-
cussion

oldman was evidently getting all the
assurance he could as to what was solid
ground under his feet and what steps
might be too risky

  weve now reached the point heubel
where i can make my arrangements almost

by clarence herbert new

any time don pablo hasnt slept much
this morning hes beginning to realize how
much money he lost at the club last night
and wonder how it will be possible for him
to pay it i happen to know that he cant
readily put his hand upon any such sum
even by mortgaging his property by
stripping himself down to his pelt he could
pay it-and he owns real estate which he
could afterward sell in order to live but
hes in a devlish uncomfortable position
i think hed almost go on his knees to me
if i proved it all nothing but an ugly
dream 

  y-e-s-your reasoning is perfectly
sound goldman i know the man well
enough to compliment you upon the
scheme but theres another angle with
all those latins which weve got to
consider-their idea of personal honor
particularly among those before the public
oh we both know that some of them can
give the edge to a tammany grafter but
itll be pretty deep under the rose sup-
pose that what you ask of don pablo ap-
pears to him slightly dishonorable reflect-
ing upon his official reputation eh
hell submit to being absolutely ruined be-
fore hell agree to it-unless you can coat
the suggestion so plausibly with apparent
harmlessness that there will seem to be
nothing really prohibitive against it

  precisely what i intend to do-and can
do all that sort of thing was discounted
in the beginning but i wont make a move
until you give me satisfactory assurance
that the combination were figuring upon
will be at windsor on a certain specified
date because-the scheme cant be
worked a second time we might think up
something else which looked possible but
its very doubtful this idea will work
and we cant afford to waste it by having
the rest of the combination incomplete

  i see your point-youre quite right of
course well-lets do a bit of checking
up and see a royal invitation to windsor
while the court is in residence is a com-
mand one may disregard it if he or she
chooses-naturally it wouldnt be a crim-
inal offense but considering that no
such invitation is issued without the fact
being previously ascertained that the pros-
pective guest not only is otherwise disen-
gaged but thoroughly appreciative of the
honor and compliment refusal would be a
direct and flagrant insult to royalty there
have been cases where persons really too
ill to leave their homes have taken the risk
free lances in diplomacy

l

rather than seem discourteous-and have
had the best possible care while in the
royal households a refusal in the case of
a person in good health would ostracize
him socially-no doubt about it unless
of course it were a question where political
complications unexpectedly were self-evi-
dent

  very well baron kalycksy of buda-
pest has been invited to windsor from the
th to the  sth inclusive-it being hinted
in diplomatic circles that he is secretly af-
filiated with the party which holds the real
balance of power in germany and austria
that he has the confidence of certain men
in moscow and petrograd and that he
carries upon his person a certain document
signed with initials only which may form
the basis of a general european under-
standing that is-he will have that docu-
ment with him at windsor at other times
he keeps it in one of the bank of england
vaults by courtesy of his majestys gov-
ernment kalycksy will be there if he has
to be carried on a stretcher another guest
will be a mr selwyn bradburn-an amer-
ican financier who is understood to repre-
sent the views of a dozen or more influential
senators in washington and by means of
his banking affiliations throughout the
world to understand european conditions
better than any other american his wife
is quite a celebrated woman in the states
on account of her beauty and influence
among the womens organizations they
will be there from the th to the th

  during the war certain nations were
neutral-their interests not being vitally
affected to the extent of dragging them in
and they occupy a similar position of aloof-
ness during this period of reconstruction
for this reason the accredited envoy of
such a state if it be one of the more or less
influential nations is desirable as represent-
ing general outside opinion in any dis-
cussion of european politics-and don
pablo is quite naturally the one who would
be chosen in such capacity on account of
his fine old family his exhaustive knowl-
edge of diplomatic affairs and the in-
dividual popularity of both his daughter
and himself he has accepted an invita-
tion from the th to the th there
will be half a dozen government men-
some of the continental princes but the
secret organization which has probably
more widespread political influence than
any other party in existence will have no
representative at windsor during a time

the blue

when there may be conferences likely to
change the map of europe if not that of
the world and your contention has been
that at any cost this organization must
have a representative on the ground even
though he hasnt been invited and has no
prospect of being so does all this re-
move your doubts

  oldman smoked a moment or two in
  deep thought

  h-m-m-i cant seem to think of any-
thing youve left out probably i never
quite realized before how imperative a
royal invitation is they joke occasionally
in the united states about some boor de-
clining a presidential invitation-laugh at
the idea of its being a command but now
i think of it i cant remember a case where
any excuse was accepted the invited
party went to the white house when he
was asked to go and behaved himself as
well as he could while there all of this
of course materially strengthens my
scheme think id better drive in and see
don pablo at the embassy before he has
time to do anything foolish

  hmph that hadnt occurred to me
but its entirely possible if he should
happen to shoot himself-eh that would
make your whole scheme impossible and
im beginning to believe its something
which should be put through at all risks
we may lose more than we can recover if
it isnt here ill telephone for a taxi
at once get in there to the embassy as
quickly as you can

  now being the man of unimpeachable
honor he was it must be admitted that
don pablo had gotten out his army pistols
after breakfast in bed that noon-and
after thoughtfully fingering them over had
given them to his valet to clean he had
courage of that by no means common type
which calmly faces trouble disgrace or
death-and keeps persistently hammering
away at the solution until one is figured
out he was very much let down with
the worst case of blues he ever remem-
bered tried to recall how much hed had
to drink the night before and whether his
recklessness could be laid to that but hed
been always a temperate drinker because
of his liver as nearly as he could decide
he was at one time nearly ten thousand
pounds ahead of the game-which recouped
all of his previous losses and when he had
felt himself slipping back again he had
simply plunged with the conviction that
book magazine

t

luck having favored him before was cer-
tain to do so again when goldmans
card was brought up to him it seemed an
evidence of wretched taste why couldnt
the man let him alone for a day or two-
hed get his money somehow don pablo
refused to see the visitor

  but his former supposed friend scribbled
upon a leaf from his notebook

  youve merely had a bad dream my
  friend i bring you some very good news
  let me come up if youre not dressed

  this goldman put in an envelope and
sealed when the ambassador read it he
suspected a trick an excuse to dun him
in person but he faced that possibility like
the gentleman he was and had the man
fetched up as soon as the valet had left
the room goldman hunted about for an
ash-tray which he placed upon a table by
the dons bedside then taking from his
pocket the bunch of easily recognizable
i-o-us he calmly struck a match and
lighted them letting the ashes fall into the
tray until they were entirely consumed

  there my friend you wrote but
three which were not given to me and i
took those up this morning-as i could
well afford to with my other winnings
aside from your money im still five thou-
sand pounds ahead on poker since i came
to london-which isnt bad at all 

  but-i cannot see how your burning
those obligations makes the slightest dif-
ference in my indebtedness i was sober
enough to remember the total amount due
you very clearly-have been figuring over
the payment ever since i woke up this
morning your having nothing tangible to
prove it makes my obligation all the more
a debt of honor

  my dear friend would you feel badly
if i hurt your feelings as long as i saved
your honor absolutely listen please
certain men are born with what we term
card-sense for want of a better name-
though it should be called the sense of
risk and chance since it applies to every
other game as well the majority of men
lack this gift entirely even though they
play many games very fairly when you
add to it the sort of nerve one acquires by
living in such countries as cuba and mex-
ico where quick-shooting ability is much
better protection than such law as there
is the result is a poker-player-who can
win at all games anywhere in the world
save when he runs up against other men

by clarence herbert new

of the same type frankly seriously you
hadnt a chance in playing poker against
me so-the only honorable thing i can
do is to destroy your obligations cant
you see my position-and accept it

  but my good goldman-several other
men saw you win that money from me
they are as certain as i am that the game
was perfectly straight what position
does it put me in before them when they
learn that i didnt take up my obligations

  how are they ever going to know you
didnt i certainly wont tell you cer-
tainly wont they know nothing as to
your resources in fact it is quite likely
to help your credit if its hinted about
that you paid such a sum without being
inconvenienced drive out to richmond
for tea with me as soon as youre dressed
youll forget all this by the time we get
there-and you assuredly wont look like a
man who is seriously cramped by a heavy
loss

  but my friend cant you see that this
unlooked for courtesy upon your part
leaves me still under very heavy obliga-
tions to you there is no question what-
ever that my indebtedness was perfectly
valid-or that a less generous man would
have collected the money without a
thought 

  oh well if thats bothering you we
can easily think up some little thing you
can do for me which ill gladly accept as
canceling the obligation entirely that
shouldnt be difficult

  have you anything in mind

  why-no i didnt suppose youd take
this so seriously after id explained that 
frequently play poker with texans-and
win money from them a man has to have
his nerve right with him to do that but
if its going to make you any more com-
fortable in mind ill see what i can figure
out-after weve had our tea

there was no getting around the fact
that don pablo was feeling easier in
mind and yet with his castilian ideas
upon personal honor he was uneasy in a
different way his i-o-us were no longer
in existence-he was certainly in position
to say they would be paid when presented
or that he had offered to pay without such
presentation but that didnt get around
the fact that he was very deeply obligated
to his friend goldman for an unnecessarily
generous act it was uppermost in his
mind all the time they were having their
free lances in diplomacy

tea and chatting with three or four ac-
quaintances who happened to be at the
star  garter at the moment when these
had left for town and they were idling over
their cigarettes he again asked goldman to
think up some particular favor or service
which might be done for him presently
the supposed cuban laughed

  youll be much amused at my child-
ishness excelencia something has just oc-
curred to me which has been really a strong
desire for many years you know a good
many of us in cuba are still royalists at
heart-loyal to the old regime and the once
powerful crown of spain as a mere citizen
with no pretensions to noble blood i have
always admired royalty not only in spain
but in england - italy - austria - and
wished it were possible for me to see how
it lived from the inside i know that com-
moners are frequently received as guests in
the royal palaces if there is any good rea-
son for it and ive often stood on the
street looking in at palace windows in ma-
drid rome or london-wondering what it
was really like inside how royalty got
through its days and evenings what went
on in the palaces-trying to get the picture
from newspaper and magazine accounts
but never getting much satisfaction

   old windsor down there for example
im told that youre to be one of the
kings guests for a week-as much in a
personal capacity as an official one and
from what ive picked up as to the cus-
tomary usage in such cases i infer that
a suite of several persons will accompany
you-maids for dona ysobella-valets
secretaries and aides for yourself so-
your insistence upon this question of ob-
ligation has rather set me wondering
whether it might be possible for me to ac-
company you to windsor in some official
or semiofficial capacity-assistant secre-
tary financial adviser to the embassy-
even valet if necessary-no that wouldnt
do there might be some one there who
knew me but the other capacities might
be plausible enough eh

pvistress and regret began to appear
 in don pablos face

  my friend you should have allowed me
to pay my losses it would be easier to
do that than what you suggest i am per-
sonally responsible for everyone who ac-
companies me-must give a list of their
names to sir derek master of the house-
hold and to colonel stiles inspector of

the blue

windsor castle the slightest false rep-
resentation concerning any one of them
would be a very serious breach of etiquette
even if merely an oversight upon my part
-might cause my recall from the em-
bassy

  oh well-let us say no more about it
then i had no thought of embarrassing
you by the suggestion it was merely
something id dreamed of all my life and
seemed quite harmless when i thought of
it i supposed you were authorized to ap-
point desirable men to a few of the official
positions in the embassy-

  that is quite true but i must submit
such appointments to our foreign office
in madrid-have the names approved by
the secretary

  who happens to be my very good
friend don felipe alvarazo-

  you know him he is really your
friend you think he would approve your
appointment to an official position in the
london embassy

  cable him-and see suggest me as
temporary financial adviser as it hap-
pens i am not without some influence in
the cortes some of the senators and
grandees are under obligations to me
why-but-then- i knew nothing of
this of course why-then-what you
suggest may not be altogether impossible
after all my list need not be sent down
until the end of the week though i would
prefer it should go a little sooner

  im afraid that without in the least
understanding your delicate official posi-
tion i just happened to think of some-
thing which might somehow prove embar-
rassing to you lets forget it some
other time ill think up another foolish de-
sire which may be more easily gratified
not so my good friend not so i
would risk much official embarrassment to
please you after your great courtesy to me
here is something which you say has been
a lifelong desire-i do not consider it
foolish i can understand your feeling in
the matter perfectly it is something
which in a monarchical country might be
impossible for you to do unless you had
rendered some brilliant service to the
crown in some ways you will be disap-
pointed-because royalty lives these days
much like other people but on the whole
i think it will prove even beyond your ex-
pectations because there is a good deal of
ceremonial-the costumes and decorations
are brilliant-the state banquets something
book magazine



you would never see elsewhere upon the
same scale of magnificence si si it
will be an experience which you will re-
member-and value

  at first-the idea is impossible-as you
saw but then-your friendship with don
felipe is of another complexion altogether
-it makes the thing practical if you are
quite sure he will endorse you it might
have occured to me i suppose that you
were much the man-of-affairs in new york
and cuba and were likely to have strong
connections over here but i did not see-
the idea was startling to me it seemed
that it might touch my personal and of-
ficial reputation too closely now-let us
go about the business at once your sug-
gestion as to financial adviser is not so
bad i am supposed to learn what i can
and report upon various english bond-is-
sues particularly those sponsored by the
government-also openings for the invest-
ment of spanish funds it might seem
quite necessary that i should secure a man
of experience in such matters to advise our
embassy i will cable don felipe at once
upon our return-suggesting you do not
however overlook the fact that one cannot
have too much influence in madrid for any-
thing he may wish to obtain-if you can
pull a few wires there by cable it may
prove just the difference between approval
and rejection

  goldman smiled behind the hand which
was caressing his mustache with the
ambassadors consent to the scheme the
thing was as good as done he had no fear
of adverse action in madrid-certain men
there being dangerously in his power

a ll this of course was byplay and de-
 tail of which trevor and his friends
couldnt possibly obtain knowledge except
by the merest fluke of luck-and one must
not depend upon that sort of thing what
most endangered goldmans scheme in their
case was no incautious word dropped where
they might have overheard it or even oc-
casional association with some one who
might be under their suspicion it was
simply that he and his poker-game at st
james club had thoroughly aroused their
curiosity-and their logical minds didnt
permit them to dismiss as of no con-
sequence an occurrence which intrigued
them to that extent while the don and
his friend were at richmond the free
lances were having their own tea with
countess nan in park lane and discussing

by clarence herbert new

the matter with her five days later it
just happened that sir derek was dining
with them-being a very old friend who
partly owed his appointment to her lady-
ship the court was going down to wind-
sor the following week and as they were
smoking in the big jacobean library after
dinner before official duties compelled sir
derek to hurry away he casually made
some comment upon the friendship between
don pablo and the man who was said to
have won a perfectly staggering sum from
him the week before

  there is of course one explanation of
what seemed a deliberate attempt upon mr
goldmans part to break his friend irre-
trievably i am assuming that i got the
story correctly from an eyewitness-just
as it happened-an explanation which puts
mr goldman in a really very creditable
light that is-a belief upon his part that
don pablo has an occasional weakness for
plunging in pretty high play and the wish
to give him a practical demonstration of
how easily he might be rooked out of every
penny he has by sharpers or even men
who play a much stronger though perfectly
honorable game if this supposition is cor-
rect goldman presumably returned his
i-o-us-which would account for the
dons having no appearance of one who
has met with a serious financial loss-also
for continued evidence of friendship be-
tween the two even to the extent of ap-
pointing mr goldman financial adviser to
the embassy-a position which im told
he is entirely capable of filling satisfac-
torily

  whats that sir derek has gold-
man really been appointed to such a posi-
tion hed have to be confirmed at ma-
drid you know

  he appears to stand very well at ma-
drid-quite to my surprise his endorse-
ment came back without the slightest ques-
tion you see his name is on don pablos
list for windsor next week in this official
capacity having heard considerable gos-
sip about that poker-game at st james
it was naturally my duty to cable both
havana and new york for reports con-
cerning him the man doesnt appear to
be very widely known over there but those
who do know him say there is absolutely
nothing to his discredit the impression
being that he purposely keeps out of the
limelight but has rather extensive influence
under the surface this left no excuse for
me to withhold approval as a guest of
free lances in diplomacy

their majesties-and strengthens the sup-
position that he was merely teaching his
friend a lesson in the danger of high play
but i must confess the man gave me an
opposite impression upon the single oc-
casion when we met a physiognomist
would deny any generous quality in him or
the possibility of cultivating one-which
shows how easy it is for science to be mis-
leading in some cases

  me for the scientific verdict all the
same old chap and ill wager you a hun-
dred quid that its not wrong in goldmans
case either--proof to be forthcoming with-
in three months or you take the money

  but-deuce take it what reason have

i	for refusing to receive him at windsor
though ill book your wager merely as a
sporting gamble

tone whatever there probably is none
that the british public will ever hear
of and such a refusal might be the most
serious mistake of your career my friend
let the man come to windsor by all
means otherwise well never know just
whats up-or whether theres anything in

this affair at alljust a moment i

know youre due at buckingham-but
weve got to have a bit more data before
you go isnt baron kalycksy of hun-
gary to be there at the same time    
yes id heard so and mr selwyn
bradburn the american banker leon
rochemain of paris and four or five
of the cabinet you see there will be
discussions in off hours that certain under-
world interests would give practically any-
thing to overhear-discussions which may
reshape europe this is all pure conjec-
ture of course-but ill wager its not so
far out

  look here old chap we four havent
been in one of the royal houses for several
months-been out of england upon various
affairs of our own as far as anybody knows
so we should be welcome enough just at
this time-and ive the conviction that if
were not among the guests at windsor
from the th to tha th or perhaps a bit
longer something may happen which will
be a serious matter for his majestys gov-
ernment can you manage it-so that
their majesties will see no ulterior object
in the invitation

  why-i fancy it shouldnt be difficult
in your cases but frankly you know they
dont care about too large a house-party
at any one time

the blue

  hmph they might better dispense
with some one else in the circumstances
but of course we cant tell them that-

  oh theyll want you-as soon as i
make the suggestion i know too well
how you four stand with them to question
that the only point i had in mind was
how to put the suggestion in such a way as
to appear casual-an invitation which
might be extended some other time as well
and yet be sure of having you down this
time with no slip-up on it

  tell em were leaving for the orient
almost immediately but that you happen
to know we have this particular time more
or less open that ought to settle it the
one thing we dont want to do if it can be
avoided is to let them get the impression
that something dangerous is underfoot
within the walls of old windsor it would be
difficult to keep some trace of it from
showing in their manner theyd be haunted
by suspicion of this guest or that one when
those suspicions wouldnt hit the mark at
all-be doing  grave injustice to loyal
friends when one thinks of what has
actually occurred at windsor during past
centuries the wonder is that there hasnt
been a good deal more intrigue since vic-
toria ascended the throne

  er-aside from the fact that there are
possibly no four persons in england whom
their majesties would prefer as guests
next week if room can be made for you
theres no question as i understand it
that you really anticipate some occurrence
down yonder which must be prevented at
almost any cost-or that you feel your-
selves able to forestall it if you are in the
castle

  that covers the condition exactly old
chap if you cant get us there in the
obvious way our only recourse is to run
down and ask for a private interview with
the king-which may spill the beans and
make the whole affair a fiasco to be more
successfully carried out at some other time
understand me clearly please if mr
goldman is what we suspect him to be-
which is no reflection upon the delightful
and unsuspicious don pablo-if we catch
him in the act as seems quite possible itll
head off further trouble from him and his
associates for some years we will make
sure of that on the other hand if he is
permitted to mix freely with the other
guests be present at informal conversations
he might pick up enough confidential in-
formation to flop england upside-down
book magazine



politically were putting considerable
responsibility upon you of course-but you
owe your present appointment to your un-
failing tact and youll manage somehow

yvhen the king heard the suggestion
 that it might be a favorable opportunity
for including the trevors earl lammer-
ford and sir abdool mohammed khan
among his guests at windsor his imme-
diate exclamation was one of surprise that
they had not been among the first on the
list if they were in england and available
at the time her majesty overhearing
this promptly agreed with him-though
she instinctively felt that the trevors at-
titude in her case was one of unfailing
courtesy and respect rather than the per-
sonal liking she would have preferred it
was one of those cases where three people
with every reason to be friends-continually
doing little friendly acts for each other-
are temperamentally repelled nobody is
to blame for this sort of thing it just hap-
pens

  when the party arrived at windsor
they were met by sir derek as master of
the household and lodged with their serv-
ants in one of the towers he said that
dinner was at eight-forty-five as in king
edwards time and that the party as-
sembled in the red drawing-room at eight-
thirty as this was at some distance from
their quarters through the long gallery
sir derek offered to send a page for them
just before the hour but knowing the castle
rather better than he did if that were pos-
sible they assured him this would be un-
necessary

  it occurred to lammerford however
that it would serve more than one purpose
if goldman could be lodged at some little
distance from the others of don pablos
suite who were just arriving by another
train their friend looked at the earl in
considerable surprise at this suggestion-
having actually assigned the man and his
valet to rooms in their wing of the visitors
apartments from lack of space with the
rest of the suite unless they were doubled
up uncomfortably a few moments later
goldman expressed himself as very much
pleased with the location of his room as
he preferred quiet when he had work to do
actually nothing could have suited him
better than this opportunity for exploring
certain parts of the castle by himself
without being seen by his companions of
he embassy suite he was shown the

by clarence herbert new

shortest cut to don pablos chamber of
course-and availed himself of it to be
with the ambassador in off hours with the
excuse of desiring some coaching as to
court etiquette he proved himself so apt
a pupil that the trusting don pablo was
amazed-the man might have lived at
court for half his life as far as his perfect
manner and correctness in little details
were concerned he confided to his friend
and patron that he had done a good bit
of reading on the subject and tried to profit
by what he had learned with an affable
manner and enough surface polish to pass
for much more than he had he attracted
several of the other guests-to such an ex-
tent in fact that the second day saw him
entirely at his ease upon pleasant speak-
ing terms with everybody sir derek was
convinced by this time that he and the
trevors had done the man a great in-
justice but lammerford whispered to him
when he found occasion that they were
quite willing to double their wagers if he
cared about taking them on that night
baron kalycksy arrived

at eight-thirty the house-party were as-
sembled in the red drawing-room where
most of them found old acquaintances and
were standing about chatting when sir
derek announced that the royal party were
coming-arranging the guests in two rows
men on one side and women on the other
then the doors leading to the royal apart-
ments opened and the king appeared with
the duchess of york the queen following
with the prince of wales and then the
duke of york with one of the visiting
princesses there were several royal rel-
atives in the party who had been lodged
in the state apartments on the north side
of the quadrangle

  the scene was a brilliant one-the men
being in court breeches with such orders
as they possessed pinned to their dress
coats several were in striking uniforms
with patent-leather boots and fully half
were in the windsor uniform of black with
scarlet facings the women were in beauti-
ful gowns with their jewels flashing from
throat coiffure and arms his majesty
wore the gold garter over his black silk
stocking and the broad blue cordon of the
order across his chest as host in his own
castle he had a dignity in bearing which
seemingly added several inches to his
medium height but his expression was ani-
mated as he chatted with one or another
free lances in diplomacy

old friend among the guests and in spite of
malicious gossip to the contrary he proved
himself a most excellent conversationalist
with a wide range of topics the queen-
a tall woman whose good looks improve
with maturity-made a very striking figure
her gown and jewels being really magnifi-
cent

  promptly at eight-forty-five the doors
were opened and the party marched into
the large banqueting-room with detailles
picture of king edward and the duke of
connaught covering one entire end his
majesty had the duchess of york on his
right and countess nan of dyvnaint on his
left the queen sat between wales and
baron kalycksy the table presented an
appearance not often seen except under
similar conditions with its gold service and
dark blue sevres its crimson and white
flowers a highlander in full costume stood
behind the kings chair a perfectly drilled
staff of servants noiselessly and promptly
served the courses in one of the ante-
rooms the castle orchestra played various
classic selections interspersed now and then
with some popular hit of the day-this it
was said upon a hint from the prince of
wales who goes in for all the democracy he
considers safe

  goldman had figured that with his per-
sistently cultivated acquaintance among
the other guests and the pleasant im-
pression he had so carefully produced
he would be rather well placed at the for-
mal dinners-but the seating arrange-
ments were in the hands of a secretary
acting under the orders of sir derek and
the supposed cuban had been very care-
fully placed where he could do the least
possible harm and where he was under con-
stant espionage even though he was by
virtue of his official position the only one
of don pablos suite permitted to appear
at the guests table with their majesties

either the king nor the queen had
  the vaguest suspicion that the trevors
earl lammerford or sir abdool were in
the castle for any other reason than a
courteous and appreciative acceptance of
the royal invitation his majesty had two
or three times expressed his satisfaction to
sir derek for reminding him that the four
were in london at the moment and would
probably be at liberty to run down if the
invitation came to them-for the king
more thoroughly than any of his states-
men perhaps knew what the british

the blue

crown-and two or three other govern-
ments as well-owed to them

  it might however have been noticed had
anyone in the secret been watching them
closely that the free lances were quietly
at their old trick of effacing themselves from
any prominence among the other guests
while talking with this or that celebrity
in the center of a surrounding group their
well-known personal mannerisms were as
much in evidence as usual a moment
later when they had walked a few paces
away the mannerisms disappeared-totally
different ones took their places three dif-
ferent times when both trevor and lam-
merford were standing with others but a
short distance from him some prominent
guest asked where have the trevors and
lammerford gone to im positive i saw
them here in this room a little while ago
once the king asked the same question-
and overhearing it earl lammerford
stepped from a small group within eight
feet of him in two such groups during
the evening some one said i fancy
trevor has something on his mind tonight
-he doesnt seem to be himself at all
in fact at a little distance i doubt if i
should have recognized him

  all of this sort of thing made it much
easier to watch goldman for indications of
what he might have in mind-what plan
or system he might be following to accom-
plish whatever he wished to accomplish
presently sir abdool noticed that he was
cultivating the acquaintance of mr selwyn
bradburn as a fellow-banker-evidently
displaying a sufficient grasp of european
affairs to hold that gentlemans interest a
few moments later they stopped baron
kalycksy as he was passing and drew him
into the conversation if trevor had been
right in his surmise as to what the fellow
might be after lammerford decided that
he had established a pretty good footing
right at the start

  king edward had been an inveterate
card-player and while at windsor almost
invariably sat down for an hour at bridge
after dinner in one of the adjoining rooms
but king george on this particular eve-
ning had discovered in mr selwyn brad-
burn a fellow stamp-enthusiast and was
quite eager to have him inspect his famous
collection which had been sent down to the
honorable john fortescue librarian of
windsor for rearrangement in a more sys-
tematic way on second thought however
his majesty decided they would need a
book magazine

whole afternoon at least even to glance at
the specimens and made the appointment
for the following day-then took half a
dozen of the men and women interested
in arms and hunting around into the guard
chamber where one of the worlds finest
collections is installed incidentally king
george is admitted to be one of the first
shots in the kingdom

the trevors had been given one of the

	suites in the victoria tower overlook-
ing both the south terrace and the east
terrace gardens-one of the most desirable
in the entire castle lammerford and sir
abdool with their valets were near by in
a suite overlooking the quadrangle of the
upper ward with the state apartments
opposite on the north side of the quad-
rangle when their majesties retired
with their royal guests at the entrance of
the private apartments just before mid-
night-a shooting-party for the men being
arranged for the following morning with a
luncheon rendezvous for the ladies at vir-
ginia water-the four old friends went
into lammerfords suite and stood at one
of his windows as they speculated upon
what might be afoot in the castle below
them there seemed to be a good deal of
activity in the quadrangle for that time
of night though-owing to the thickness
of the walls-the place was almost op-
pressively still the guard was changed
at midnight and there were evidently of-
ficers or messengers arriving by way of the
lower ward-but the way they seemed to
move about with a total absence of noise
save for the occasional clink of a saber or
scrape of a spur on the stones was a mys-
tery while they were discussing the
events of the evening a muttered exclama-
tion from sir abdool stopped them

  look that servant in livery-cross-
ing the quadrangle examine his face in
the moonlight if he turns it this way again
ah now look-closely something fa-
miliar-eh that man was one of the ex-
tras in the banqueting room this evening-
carrying out the dishes after each course
his face was hauntingly familiar even
then-but i couldnt place him can you
lammy

  just a moment it will come to me i
fancy ah i have it the man heubel
-who was at home with himself at the
little house in chelsea well-a chelsea
house-owner or even lessee as one of the
windsor servants is a bit unusual-what

by clarence herbert new

s

  point is-the fellow presumably has the
run of the visitors apartments in this wing
at least-may be even permitted to go and
come in several of the private apartments
and thered be much less difficulty in his
getting such a berth than for goldman to

come here as a guestwatch him

hes heading for the quadrangle-door of
the south turret where both goldman and
baron kalycksy happen to be lodged if
we hurry we can reach a dark corner in
that passage as he comes up the stairs-if
he does come up allons

hphey just managed to reach a place in
a the pitch-dark shadow when heubel
noiselessly appeared at the top of the stair
and went directly along the passage to
goldmans door where after a couple of
peculiar knocks he was promptly ad-
mitted that settled the status of both
men in windsor as soon as the master of
the household and the inspector heard of
it in a few moments goldman came out
casually and walked down the corridor to
the door of baron kalycksys suite where
he was presently admitted as if expected
the watchers in the corridor could think
of no plausible excuse for following him
in so just to occupy themselves they re-
turned to goldmans room knocked in the
same peculiar way-and were admitted by
the supposed servant heubel they bound
and gagged him the walls completely dead-
ening his one or two shouts-and stowed
him in a closet of lammerfords suite pend-
ing further developments

  what happened in the barons rooms
was this-though nobody ever heard or
even suspected the details his bedroom
drawing-room and bath were separated
from the rooms above where his personal
aide and valet were lodged by a narrow
winding stair in the wall-and when they
had admitted his nocturnal visitor he dis-
missed them he and the supposed cuban
then talked for half an hour concerning a
realignment of the european states-after
which he became completely unconscious
from some drug in the heavenly cigar which
goldman had given him and that enter-
prising crook systematically went through
not only the clothes he wore but all the
others in the suite and four large port-
manteaus as well eventually he located a
document upon heavy parchment-bond
paper with a number of initials scrawled
at the foot of it-and his face registered
deep satisfaction it had taken all the
free lances in diplomacy



nerve he had to work methodically against
the possibility of interruption at any mo-
ment so restoring some appearance of
order he slipped out into the corridor and
back to his own room without caring
whether he had securely closed the barons
door or not

  once in his own quarters goldman was
quietly bound and gagged as heubel
had been-then searched the initialed
document and three others were taken from
an inside pocket he was then stowed in a
closet of countess nans suite-where his
mere presence would be against him if he
made a row-while trevor and sir abdool
stole along to the barons rooms and went
in fastening the door against interruption
the baron lay sprawled across a divan-
his dothes and dressing-robe in disorder
as goldman had left him he was still
completely unconscious but his pulse was
regular and there was no indication that
he would not recover in a short time
looking about the room trevor muttered

  what weve to do abdool is guess
where hed been keeping these documents
and put everything so nearly in order that
hell not suspect his belongings have been
meddled with by his manner and way of
wearing his clothes hes a bit careless-
disorderly about everything-which makes
the job a bit easier though his aide may

be more systematic stop a bit

heres a portmanteau with a lot of papers
and correspondence in one side of it-

  the very place he would not be likely
to keep documents as important as these
my idea would be in the deep pocket under
this soiled clothing in this other portman-
teau ah see here is a document
deep in which goldman apparently over-
looked

  faith i believe youre right abdool
little question of it in fact well just
place the papers back there-lock the
portmanteaus-straighten things up a bit
and get out of here before we have to ex-
plain how we happen to be here at all
eh

  in the early days of their friendship
back in india sir abdool as evidence of
gratitude toward the man who had saved
him from being torn apart by a tiger had
acted for a year or two as his personal valet
--becoming familiar with all a valets ways
of packing and keeping clothing so when
the two had rearranged the barons per-
sonal belongings neither he nor his at-

by clarence herbert new

tendants could have suspected that they
had been disturbed then they turned the
key in the door from the outside and went
back to join the others

jext afternoon sir derek took an op-

	portune moment for the explanation to
his majesty that a financial question con-
cerning the embassy made it almost im-
perative that the honorable mr goldman
return to london at once-greatly to his
regret-and that he most respectfully
asked the kings permission to leave the
castle it was an unusual request and
yet plausible enough in the case of a person
who was one of a suite-a royal guest only
by courtesy conceivably a man in gold-
mans official position might be urgently
needed at the embassy so his majesty
kindly expressed regret for the necessity
and said that if possible mr goldman
should return before the expiration of don
pablos visit at windsor-which had been
extended until the following week

  as for the don himself he got the same
story after goldman was supposed to have
left the castle-being a good deal upset
by it until lammerford told him in con-
fidence that the man had really committed
a slight breach of court etiquette-through
ignorance it was thought-and that sir
derek had decided upon this as the best
way of getting him out of the castle with-
out arousing gossip which might reach the
king presenting his apology to the ambas-
sador for interfering with one of his suite
because of an act which in no possible way
reflected upon don pablo himself

  when goldman and heubel actually did
leave the castle at two a m they were
in a limousine partly doped-and found
themselves next day upon one of the navy
destroyers bound for an island in the in-
dian ocean where they are now spending
a few monotonous though not altogether
idle years

  in paying his sporting bets to trevor
lammerford and sir abdool sir derek ex-
pressed the opinion that the service they
had rendered would have been cheap at a
hundred times the amount it had almost
unquestionably prevented most serious
complications for the government and an
occurrence in the palace which would have
necessitated his resignation for-as it
happened-certain conversations did take
place at windsor which are likely to have
far-reaching effects

watch for another thrilling story of the free lances in the next issue
when the kid napped

        the joyous saga of a four-cornered mix-up wherein a brawny
        sea-captain a mexican bandit four cowboys and a railroad
        train-crew took active parts-to say nothing of a u s marshal
        and the captain of a warship things happen in this story

by carl clausen

when black mcturk of the bark
albatross put into the little sleepy
seaport of san mateo lower cali-
fornia for repairs and if possible to re-
plenish his crew he stepped into a peck
of trouble trouble up to that time had
been mcturks middle name he had
hunted it and run it down in fifty-seven
different varieties and climes and nearly
always had gotten the best of it but the
brand he was confronted with when he
walked into stuttering macs gin-emporium
on the waterfront was of a new species

  lying bill porter and his three cow-
punchers having just delivered a bunch of
shorthorns to the san mateo packing
company for shipment north were lined
up against stuttering macs mahogany

  mcturk stared at the four pairs of
sheepskin chaps and the four pairs of silver
mounted spurs never having seen a cow-
man in full regalia before his first impulse
was to emit a loud guffaw and get his

blackjack ready for the consequences but
remembering suddenly his urgent need for
sailors he restrained the impulse and with
a spurious smile of affability ordered a
round of drinks for the four roosters

  the four roosters grinned their approba-
tion and retaliated with four more rounds
stuttering mac had a busy hour mcturk
kept his weather eye peeled for a chance
to convert four cowpunchers into a bs
but the opportunity never presented itself

c in ally in desperation he invited his
 four friends aboard the albatross with
the cheerful intention of clapping down the
hatches on them they declined profusely
mcturk grew insistent he asserted with
tears in his voice that his sea hospitality
was being disdained he sulked it took
five more rounds to dispose of the sulk
his sailors honor was being insulted by
their refusal to pay his ship a visit he
grew sentimental about it
when the kid napped

  lying bill drew a deep breath he was
something of a sentimentalist himself
once after leading a lynching posse he had
insisted upon cutting the dead cattle-
rustler down and giving him a fair trial
he would fain have visited mcturks ar-
gosy but the four of them were due on the
dry side of the rio grande to meet a
second bunch of steers at daylight the fol-
lowing morning their webfooted friend
was getting to be a pest and must be dis-
posed of diplomatically casting his eye
over his shoulder he noted that the freight
train for pajaro valley via the caliente
desert was just being made up beyond
stuttering macs swinging doors tipping
his three companions the wink he agreed
to accompany mcturk aboard the bark
as they passed down the long line of shunt-
ing cars on their way to the jetty four
pairs of arms descended upon mcturk
lifted him off his feet and tossed him
through the open door of a passing box-
car the next moment the door was
slammed shut and bolted behind him

  to the conductor lying bill said as
the gang saddled up

  let it out after we get across the line
chris

  ten minutes later when chris the con-
ductor went down the track to obey lying
bills instructions he was greeted by a fusil-
lade of forty-five-caliber bullets and box-
car splinters that made him jump ten feet
in the air and land on the cowcatcher of
a passing yard engine the string of burn-
ing adjectives which followed the fusillade
through the punctured car door would have
taken chris train halfway up the six per
cent grade of the rockies if applied in the
proper place being a family man and
behind on his life-insurance he stepped
gingerly off the cowcatcher and deferred
opening the door of the box-car until the
occupant ran out of cartridges

to speed up our action as they say in
the movies we will now cut to a long
shot of a tank station on the pajaro and
san mateo railway in the middle of the
caliente desert at eight a m in the
shade of the aforesaid tank we pick up the
vaca kid lighting a cigarette under ordi-
nary circumstances the kid would not
think of sticking up a freight but he had
been down on his luck of late and he knew
where he could dispose of chris and the
engineers twenty-two-jewel movements for
fifteen dollars mex apiece

the blue



  thus it happened that when the freight
pulled in for water and the fireman reached
for the hose his hands stayed in the air
and so did the hose the engineer reached
for a monkey-wrench the kids gun spat
fire the wrench went south and the en-
gineer clapped his empty hand to his cheek
where the bullet had grazed it as it knocked
the wrench out of his hand then raised
both mitts on a level with his firemans

  the kid removed his forty-dollar som-
brero and placed it on the step of the loco-
motive

  the senores will please observe that my
lid is in the ring he remarked pleasantly
a little contribution will obviate the
necessity of an inquest in other words
shell out or be shelled

  he was a polite guy this vaca kid he
had been a general during the huerta
regime and a section boss on the southern
pacific in arizona the mexican federal
government had never quite forgiven him
for politely walking off with the funds of
the subtreasury at chihuahua the en-
gineer and his fireman sighed and parted
with their watches and loose change

  attracted by the noise of the shot chris
the conductor came loping up the line of
cars from the caboose to investigate his
curiosity cost him his watch turquoise
stickpin and eight dollars and thirty-two
cents

  the kid was dismissing the three with
a gentle reminder of what happened to
lots wife when she looked back when
the thunder of mcturks number twelve
boot shook the door of the box-car the
three men exchanged glances the kid
intercepted the glances and translated them
into coin of the realm he smacked his
lips an express messenger with a sack of
negotiables was undoubtedly hidden in the
box-car

  herding the three men abreast of the 
car he commanded chris to open the door
the conductor did so the next thing
the kid knew two hundred and ten pounds
of brine-soaked brawn leaped at him from
the open door his gun exploded pre-
maturely the bullet going wild and strik-
ing the bottom of the watertank being
dum-dummed the bullet tore a four-inch
hole in the tank from which the water
spurted in a graceful arch of twenty feet

ohris and his crew took advantage of
 the situation by hastily sorting out
their belongings from the sombrero and
book magazine



stepping on the gas while the freight
went thundering across the desert and the
water in the tank ebbed low the two com-
batants plowed up a quarter section of
virgin desert land in the futile endeavor
to tear each others windpipes out by the
roots at the end of that time mcturk
pried his thumb loose from the kids back
molars with a jerk and sat down heavily
on a prickly pear the howl he let loose
fractured the welkin in seven townships
the kid spat out two teeth and a thumb-
nail and reached for his lost gun mcturk
removed the prickly pear from his hind-
quarters and heaved it amain it caught
the kid neatly in the back of the neck and
his gun went clattering down the right of
way and landed in a thicket of-cactus

  the two men sat up and glared at each
other for the nonce thoughts of murder
were abandoned mcturk plucked twenty-
nine burning darts from his rear elevation
each pluck being followed by a stream of
exquisite profanity the kid performed a
similar operation to his neck the latin
exhortations which flowed from his swollen
lips would have furnished an excellent
theme for operatic exploitation

iwicturk scowled at the bandits chapa-
    rajo-incased extremities

  wait until i get my hands on the rest
of your fuzzy-legged gang he howled he
glanced after the speeding freight why
in blazes did they leave you behind he
demanded suddenly

  i am wondering the same about you
senor the kid replied wearily

  this is kidnaping the skipper thun-
dered the government of mexicoll pay
for this

  the kid smiled sadly

  the government of mexico never pays
for anything senor ive been six years
collecting my back pay as a general of the
federal army

  general debility mcturk scoffed as
he yanked out the last thorn with a groan

  brigadier general the kid corrected
he glanced at mcturks gold-braided cap
your rank senor he asked

   you look pretty sick yourself mcturk
leered savagely

  i mean what is your position senor
the bandit explained

  ill give it to you when i take my ob-
servations at noon mcturk replied with
some heat as his eyes traveled up and
down the right of way

by carl clausen

a shadow passed across the kids
rapidly swelling face some months
earlier he had been indiscreet enough to
cross the border and stick up a small bank
in southern arizona leaving the cashier and
two peaceful citizens with lilies in their
hands for this exploit the united states
government had placed a bounty upon his
scalp so big that the kid had come near
surrendering himself to keep anyone else
from collecting it

  the senor is a seafaring man he
asked casually

  how did you guess it sherlock holmes
mcturk gibed

  the kid drew a long breath a gold-
braided cap on a seafaring man meant to
him but one thing-a gunboat and the
presence of a gunboat in san mateo meant
that the caliente desert would henceforth
be too hot for him he had had a slight
brush with united states marines once on
the gulf and the memory still sent chills
up and down his sanguine spine

  he chose his next words carefully

  the lieutenant is here on an important
mission i take it he ventured as he
rolled a cigarette with an elaborate show
of carelessness

  how dyou get that way the skipper
growled lieutenant nothing im cap-
tain mcturk of the albatross my mis-
sion is important all right he added as
he contemplated the opportunity for re-
venge and physical calisthenics with the
kid as a deck-hand on the albatross

  the kids hand trembled slightly as he
lit the cigarette and blew a cloud of smoke
skyward to him the presence of the com-
mander of a gunboat in the middle of the
caliente desert indicated that a goodly
company of marines were not far away
he glanced sadly at the thicket of cactus
where his gun reposed irretrievably lost
never before had so excellent an excuse
for murder presented itself with so poor an
opportunity

  he turned his head at a slight sound
behind him it was the punctured water-
tank giving up its last pint to the desert
the kids face grew serious as a crow
flies it was fifty miles to the nearest water
and neither of them were crows

  all things considered the moment seemed
propitious for a little fifty-mile stroll
toward the mountain fastnesses of the state
of sonora

  suddenly the kids troubled face was
illumined by an inspiration
when the kid napped

i

  senor capitan remarked that he was
anxious to return to his ship he said
pleasantly

  the sooner the quicker mcturk re-
plied tersely when does the next train
for san mateo stop here

  tomorrow evening at sundown the
kid informed him acutely aware that a
train loaded with deputies would break the
thirty-six-hour schedule of the pajaro and
san mateo railway when chris and his
crew brought in the glad news of the mis-
carried holdup tomorrow evening one
will pass here he repeated with the ac-
cent on the word pass therell be noth-
ing for it to stop for now that the tank
is empty for the same reason therell be
nothing to keep us he paused it gets
very warm here along toward noon senor
he added as the skipper drew his handker-
chief from his pocket and began wiping the
perspiration and dust from his thick red
neck

  mcturks hand paused in midair

  meaning that theres no more water
here he asked sucking his dry lips

  oh yes senor lots of it about two
thousand feet down it would take quite
some time however to dig a well that deep
with our bare hands

  mcturks face changed color

  what hell-hole is this he demanded
thickly

  the caliente desert the kid replied
he pointed to a low range of rocky moun-
tains blue and indistinct in the shimmer-
ing haze off to the south lots of water
there he remarked casually

  mcturk pocketed his handkerchief with
a snarl as he did so his hand came in
contact with the empty gun jerking it
out he balanced it on his knee

  lead me to it and make it snappy he
growled

  the kid glanced at the weapon his
practiced eye noticed that it was unloaded
with an air of resignation he arose

  very well senor he sighed as he
led the way across the burning sands with
mcturk lumbering pistol in hand in his
trail he smiled inscrutably

yyf will now fade in three days later
upon a small guardhouse on the north
side of the rio grande and a close-up to
spike sanderson united states marshal
seated at his desk reading a letter mar-
shal sanderson was a large loosely built
man on his rugged features rode the

the blue

puzzled expression of an airedale who has
encountered a porcupine for the first time
and is doubtful about their relationship
placing the letter in the wire tray at his
elbow after having read it over three times
he reached for the telephone and asked
long distance to connect him with head-
quarters the commandant at san pablo
answered the call himself

  station k sanderson talking major
has washington got a gunboat at san
mateo he asked

  no such information came through
here the commandant replied whats
up sandy yaquis on the warpath

  no nothings up i was just won-
dering g-by

  hanging up the receiver he pressed the
button on his desk to the uniformed
deputy who answered the ring he said
any reports on the movements of the
vaca kid lately jim

  he stuck up a freight on the pajaro
and san mateo railway at a tank station
in the caliente desert three or four days
ago bungled the job nobody hurt
the kid got into a scrap with a bum steal-
ing a ride in a box-car

  this was chris version to his company
to square himself for having mcturk
aboard his train without the fare to show
for it

canderson picked up the letter from
   the wire tray

  i found this sticking under the door
when i came in this morning he said
read it

  the deputy ran his eyes down the letter
and read the following

    for twenty-five thousand dollars gold
  and immunity from arrest i will reveal the
  whereabouts of captain mcturk of the gun-
  boat albatross if not-well you know me

                        the vaca kid

  below were instructions where to leave
the money with a crude map of the loca-
tion and a gentle reminder that if more
than one man came to the spot indicated
mcturks name would henceforth be den-
nis

  what dyou make of it jim sander-
son asked

  the deputy turned the letter over then
handed it back to his superior

  somebodys spoofing you captain he
grinned

  hm said sanderson its the kids
signature i verified it from the files
book magazine

e

  theres no such gunboat as the al-
batross on the pacific the deputy ob-
jected

  i have never heard of one by that
name sanderson confessed i guess its
a hoax all right just the same youd
better double the guard for a few nights
the kids up to some sort of deviltry

  very well sir

yye will now cut back to our old friends
lying bill porter and his three cow-
boys guiding their second herd of con-
tented cows from their blistering pastures
to the cooler realms of the san mateo
packing companys refrigerators while
the herd to a cow buried its noses in the
yellow water of the rio grande at the
san francisquito ford two uniformed
horsemen hailed bill from the bank

  you fellows better keep your shooting
irons unlimbered one of the men called
out the vaca kids on the rampage
again stuck up a freight on the caliente
last tuesday morning that bunch of
cattled look good to him

  bill threw back his head and laughed

  id like to see the greaser who could
swipe my cows what train was it

  the five p m from san mateo the
man replied

  why thats old chris string of boxes
lying bill exclaimed anybody get
hurt he asked anxiously

  nope-nobody but a stiff who was steal-
ing a ride in a box-car guess he got hurt
the kid and him mixed up some i hear

  bill porter and his men exchanged
glances

  i wonder-well i wonder the cattle-
man mused as he spurred up his horse and
followed his stock across the ford

  four hours later when the four men
strolled into stuttering macs after having
delivered the cattle to the packing com-
pany the saloonkeeper drew lying bill
aside chris had left a message-an im-
portant message it took stuttering mac
twenty minutes to deliver it the gist of
it lying bill gathered was that their web-
footed friend was at this moment consort-
ing with horny toads and rattlesnakes
somewhere in the fastnesses of the sonora
mountains a prisoner of the vaca kid

  the four cowmen looked at one another
thoughtfully their little joke seemed to
have assumed serious proportions after
buying a round of drinks they unlimbered
their artillery vaulted into their saddles

by carl clausen

and rode off toward said fastnesses at a
brisk clip

vvhile the rescuing party thunders
 across the desert we will go to a me-
dium shot of the canon of los tres en-
chiladas a cavernous gash in the rugged
tortilla mountains of northern sonora in
the shade of a giant boulder sat black mc-
turk fanning himself with a mesquite
branch stretched full length on the
ground beside him lay the vaca kid his
sombrero pulled down over his inscrutable
eyes and a stem of sage between his strong
white teeth

  the senor might try making it on foot
he remarked cheerfully

  the senor glanced out over the desert
and shuddered as he remembered the fifty-
mile hike five days earlier since when no
food but bitter acorns and the roots of
wild parsnips had passed his lips he
groaned arising he buried his cracked
lips in the cool waters of a small spring the
only one within a radius of eighty-odd miles

  the kid turned over on his side and
permitted himself a smile for four days
he had led his victim about the maze of
blistering canons in search of food he
had fed him acorns that puckered his lips
and roots that set his teeth on edge and
blistered his throat

  after four days of this the skippers
helpless rage had simmered down to a con-
centrated essence of deadly fury the kid
mistaking this anglo-saxon trait for de-
feat chuckled up his sleeve had he
known what was going on in the deep
dark recesses of mcturks harassed soul
he would have stepped softly

  it was along toward evening of the sixth
day when the thunder of hoofbeats broke
the stillness of the canon the kid drew
a sigh of deep content uncle sams mes-
senger with his twenty-five thousand dol-
lars telling the skipper to stay quiet
unless he wanted to run the risk of hav-
ing his throat slit by a band of maraud-
ing yaquis the kid started down the trail

i ie did not get far at a turn in the

	trail four determined-looldng horse-
men with drawn guns barred the way in
his amazement the kid swallowed the butt
end of his cigarette as his brown hands went
up at the sharp insistence of the foremost
of the riders

  where is captain mcturk greaser
the man barked out as he dismounted and
when the kid napped



by carl clausen

jammed the muzzle of his pistol into the
kids floating rib the three other horse-
men climbed out of their saddles and
stretched their long legs luxuriously

   why its me old friend the vaca kid
said one of them whom the kid recognized
as shorty the partner of a man he had
shot to death in a running fight on the
border a year earlier this is shore a
sight for sore eyes he added patting his
lariat suggestively

  where is captain mcturk lying bill
repeated grimly as if in answer to his
question a bellowing roar rent the canon
walls and reverberated deep down in the
ancient granite foundations from behind
a boulder leaped a mighty form followed
by an avalanche of rocks the four men
sidestepped the flying stones as black mc-
turk landed in their midst the kid hav-
ing his back turned was not so fortunate
a five-pound chunk of granite caught him
behind the ear he crumpled up with-
out a sound as mcturks hamlike fist
caught lying bill on the point of his men-
dacious jaw and caused that gentleman to
do a backward handspring to a ledge
twenty feet below with a fractured collar-
bone

  you dirty skulking bunch of cow-wal-
lopers the skipper roared as his mighty
fists sawed the air ill show you what
happens when you monkey with a sailor

  he showed them the kid being hors
de combat missed the briskest little scrap
of his career when it was over four
badly battered cowmen slid to the bottom
of the canon and immersed their aching
faces to the ears in the cool waters of the
spring

  this is a hell of a rescuing-party
spluttered shorty as he dug the sand out
of his ears if he had had a gun id of
plugged him

two days later lying bill porters pinto
staggered into san mateo but lying
bill was not astraddle him in the saddle
sat black mcturk bills gun in one hand
and his lariat in the other the loop of
the lariat was thrown about the neck of a
small discouraged-looking mexican who
trudged along in the dust before the pinto
his hands tied behind his back

  stuttering mac stared hard when the
skipper dismounted herded his quarry up
to the mahogany and ordered six fingers
of gin

  holy mackerel the vaca kid the

saloonkeeper chattered as he threw his bar
towel into the air and submerged

  mcturk leaned over the bar and jammed
the gun into his ear

  six fingers i said and make it snappy
he growled

  y-y-yes sir mac stuttered

  while mcturk was pouring himself a
third drink the saloonkeeper hazarded a
question

  wha-what are you g-going to d-do with
him he asked with a scared nod at the
kid

  oh him said the skipper im going
to make a sailor out of him or skin him
alive-maybe both he jerked his thumb
over his shoulder at the pinto tied to the
hitching-post outside when your hard-
boiled friend porter and his gang comes
in give him back his horse ill send the
gun and this rope ashore by one of the
boys

cix days out of san mateo in ballast
 the albatross was hailed by the united
states cruiser monterey

  albatross ahoy a megaphoned figure
called out from the bridge heave to
im going to board you

  five minutes later a smallboat from
the cruiser with twelve marines and an
officer hove alongside to mcturk scowl-
ing down at them from the after-declc of the
bark the officer said

  it has been reported captain that you
are harboring a dangerous criminal the
vaca kid aboard your ship

  dangerous me foot mcturk snorted
if he is dangerous a jellyfish is a man-
eater come aboard and take a look at
him

  it was a very sick bandit indeed which
the marines dragged from the focstle of
the albatross his brown face had taken
on a delicate ashen gray shade and his
lips were blue with the ravages of mal-de-
mer the officer slipped unnecessary hand-
cuffs about his limp wrists and said
there is a reward of ten thousand dol-
lars coming to you captain

  the skipper drew a long breath

youre a poor business man sir five
minutes ago id have sold him to you for
sixty cents and thrown in a bottle of rum
the officer glanced at the long low
shoreline of california faint in the distance

  we are outside the three-mile limit i
believe captain he said wistfully
mcturk grinned and led the way aft

       a vividly dramatic episode described by the gifted author of south
       of shanghai the panther of one claw and other noted stories

by george f worts

the frosty blur pouring from the lens
of the electric pocket lamp in the
girls hand drifted with keen flashes
across the cut-glass bowls and plates on
the mahogany sideboard she dared not
risk turning on the dining-room lights it
might frighten the man away

  she deposited the nickeled tube on the
rug so that its white beam lighted up the
faces of the sideboard drawers and went
about her task with certitude and grace
removing from the lower drawer a heavy
linen tablecloth and decanting into this
the musical contents of the two upper ones
the crude bundle she laid in the center of
the table it would serve to arouse his
curiosity to stimulate inquiry and at the
same time to dismiss his suspicions this
was her own idea and it was the complet-
ing detail she had devoted a final touch
to her person before the dressing-table
mirror in the rear bedroom she longed
for another peek to reassure herself but
the time for that was past

fit

  the girl moved on velvety soles into the
hallway and listened heartbeats were
noisy in her throat she was trembling
perspiring a little her thoughts her fixed
plan were dissembled and scattered time
and again by the prodding of sharp fear
he might have seen her before and recog-
nize her he might penetrate her pose
instantly he might kill her he might
-oh anything might happen

  a solemn golden tongue in another room
voiced twelve sweet notes

  she concentrated on the street sounds
an automobile had stopped in front cough-
ing hysterically with an absurd squealing
of brakes he was coming a taxicab-
the daring of him

  to quiet her thrilling nerves the girl
endeavored to rehearse her part clutching
moist palms fiercely to her breast she
was enfolded by incomplete blackness
ghostly light from the theatrical district
was reflected by the low layer of cloud into
the apartment windows it was a glow
captain bill comes home

f

that brightened and waned as the clouds
moved as her eyes tired of the impression
and found it again

  the taxicab was coughing madly she
heard it rattle down the cobbled street
he would be here immediately she had
never seen this man yet she readily pic-
tured him crossing the sidewalk con-
fidently entering the marble foyer with its
attendant lights burning luxuriously in the
hearts of enormous glass pearls

  what insolence-what courage-what
magnificent audacity

   she heard the rattle of the elevator and
the groan of cables as it paused at her
floor the click and bang of the steel gate
a moment later the tumblers in the door-
lock clinked as the key was introduced on
quaking toes she crept forward he would
discover her at once that was called for
she repressed a scream of sheer nervous
anticipation

  the door opened a photographic sil-
houette of a large man was thrown toward
her was removed with a cushioned thud
the door was closed

  she heard his smooth unexcited breath-
ing the scraping of his fingernails on the
wallpaper a sudden pause occurred in
his activity the girl no longer heard
sound yet imagined she could hear through
the mad rhythm of her own heart the
quickened pumping of his

  he was standing perfectly still now as
if aware of her searching the blackness for
the thing which his refined senses had de-
tected

  a gloveless hand descended upon and
gripped her nearest shoulder she gave a
little shriek wrenched herself free and ran
panting into the dining-room crowding her-
self into a small closet previously pre-
pared for this she shut the door and
locked it with the key a grunt a heavy
footfall the flicker of yellow light were
impressions cut off when she closed the
door upon herself

the man had ignited a match its flare
introduced to him a doorway yielding
upon the flowered walls of a luxuriously
equipped dining-room occupied in the
center by a round lustrous mahogany
table over which hung from strong bronze
links a huge inverted bowl of dull but in-
distinguishable color little oil paintings
seascapes for the most part furnished the
walls with dabs of bright relief

he pressed the switch filling the room

the blue

staining the very air with suave ruby glow
from the red-shaded lamp

  closing the window which opposed a
fire-escape landing he lowered all three
shades and searched the room smilingly
whatever impulse he was preparing to act
upon was sidetracked by a discovery the
grin lost its certainty flickered vanished
in the center of the table he saw the table-
cloth folded into a rough bundle beside
it lay a curved cold-chisel and a pocket
flash-lamp he poked the sinister bundle
with an exploratory forefinger and fetched
forth a metallic tinkle quickly unfolding
the linen he exposed at its heart a compact
mass of table-silver his glance drifted to
the cold-chisel darted to the fire-escape
window he went unhesitatingly to the
girls hiding-place

  come out of there he said in a clear
firm voice

  aint-aint going to have me pinched
mister a wail of despair sprang from the
closet

  unlock that door if you dont want me
to shoot through it he said sternly

  the door burst open with head hang-
ing her dark blue toque concealing all but
the lower portion of her white face the
girl stumbled past him lifted her arms
and dropped them limply flung herself into
a chair and crossed her feet her attitude
was wretchedly defiant

  youre a bull she muttered

  do i look like a-bull the man re-
plied pleasantly

  she lifted her head with a sullen pout
seemed to lose some of her terror and
inspected him shrewdly

  he was a rugged cleanly built young
man in the uniform of a united states in-
fantry captain his skin was richly sun-
burnt he wore tortoise-framed spectacles
upon clear bright blue eyes a neatly
trimmed little dark mustache hovered upon
his upper lip his hands and feet were
large and good-looking

  what an unspeakable cad she said
to herself aloud a bull in a uniform
she decided surlily

  guess again he came back with slight
impatience stop worrying about basils
what are you doing here

  what does it look like im doing here

  a person with fixed opinions he said
dryly might accuse you of being a
burglar

  well why dont you have me pulled--
if you aint a bull
book magazine

  it hadnt entered my head he replied
in his cheery voice but since youve
brought it up id really hate to see such a
beautiful burglar rot in jail if you were a
man- he paused with amusement in his
blue eyes i dont see why i shouldnt
let you go if- he stopped

  if what she cried springing up with
dusky eyes angrily sparkling

  you are a mighty pretty girl he said
stop pouting

  she stopped pouting and noticed upon
each of his sleeves a gold chevron indicat-
ing one wound and service overseas it
took all of her ability to keep out of her
expression the contempt that the sight of
the wound-chevron induced in her

  unspeakable cad she again com-
mented to herself

  what you expect me to tell you-the
story of my life she said sarcastically

  the captain had a splendid grin it
momentarily disarmed her such a whole-
some old-fashioned grin set in a face of
such strength-could it be possible

  what else can i do she added petu-
lantly

  youre not pretty when you pout
sure carry on allez id rather hear
the story of your life than tell you the
story of my own and thats some con-
cession youre a blessing in disguise

  am i why the girl seemed to be
recovering her courage or masking her
fright behind impertinence

  one hasnt the pleasure of meeting
genuine lady burglars more than ten or
twelve times in a lifetime you know and
my early studies were restricted by very
stern parents

  oh she said in a voice of enlighten-
ment

  what are you doing this for he
asked you dont look poor is there a
man back of it

  not if i see him first she snapped
a girl has to get her bread and beans
some way ones got to live dont they

  what was it the philosopher said we
are born-to eat and sleep fascinating
he murmured

  what she asked with a frown

  you he said with his grin

  h-h

  shall we romp into the library

  shall we

  if you dont object strenuously he
said bowing ironically he strode into the
hall and flung aside red curtains

by george f worts



  he grinned as she scurried under his
arm she wanted to laugh she was
bursting with hysterical relief it was
working out beautifully-magically he
had actually commanded her to talk about
herself

  it was a luxurious room with oriental
rugs underfoot ancient mahogany pieces
and a touch here and there of wicker a
desk lamp with a yellow shade of silk
squatted upon a low colonial table near a
brick fireplace a telephone stood be-
side it

  the officer jerked a brass chain the
reading-lamp emerged from the darkness as
a fat and golden oriental moon

  how long you going to keep me the
girl asked sullenly moving about the table
to the chair nearest the telephone

  oh an hour perhaps sit down please
honest aint you going to turn me over
to the bulls

  have i said so

  havent said you werent-piteously
are you

  not if you can hold my interest for an
hour

  what with she sat down

  with an account of yourself of course
but first tell me how you happen to be
dressed so well for a-burglar

rthe question seemed to arouse her in-

	terest exceedingly she bent toward
him with an air of confidence and in so
doing her entire face under the blue toque
was displayed in the pure white rays
streaming downward from the golden shade

  it gave him the opportunity to see that
she was true to type she was really strik-
ingly pretty-that is to say a study in
sharp contrasts with curling dark hair
amazingly dark brows and lashes and
pupils opposing a white satiny skin upon
which deep and shallow feelings were being
translated constantly her expression
seemed to change on the instant drifting
from one delicate shade to another at an
alarming and fascinating pace excepting
this sensitiveness her voice her very at-
titude stamped her as the by-product of
the larger american city-the high-keyed
astute sophisticated impertinent little
cockney she talked nasally

  listen here fellow she said to
make good at anything you tackle in this
mans village you got to look a part see
new york dont savvy rag dolls you got
to look the part of a doll with coin
captain bill conies home



  you do he murmured admiringly

  do i ree-ally she was sarcastic
gee aint you regular do you think
of those nice things to say all the time
youre not being kidded he said

  she moistened her lips the region
about them displayed a surprising amount
of strength heres how it works yeah
week bfore last i plied for a chorus job
in the summer palace show and blieve
me old-timer i was some little raggedy
doll just blew in from chi that di-
rector he took one squint and he says to
me girlie you wait outside and well talk
things all over say maybe you dont
think i hissed in that mutts face i beat
it right home and i dug up- she
stopped with a look of fright you aint
a bull are you honest capn

  the officer wagged his head

  is this your apartment

  for tonight he said

  aint the owner coming

  no what was it you dug up

  she studied him anxiously folded in her
lower lip expelled it finished dug up
dads old kit-bag and i pulled a job
you did he exclaimed without
practice

  the girl nodded slyly not exactly
without practice johnny dad was about
as good as the old-timers ever got an i
guess i know one of the first in the game
to use the oxy-gas torch on the new kind
of steel that was coming in she pro-
duced a sigh of weariness well they
landed the old man up the river the
old stuffquicklime

che wiggled her shoulders and became
silent moodily inspecting the tips of
her little russet boots

  left nothing the captain put in
clearing his throat

  her dusky eyes leaped up oh my
yes his kit-bag was i a little crook
after they planted dad hell i did every-
thing the smoothest old dame in the
world-lived in our tenement-wised me
up shoplifting say did you ever suspect
that shoplifting is more of a science than
plumbing

  is that a fact her audience breathed
ill say it is say-did you say some-
thing about a skag

  you bet the captain opened an en-
graved silver case cork-tip or plain
well you sure are some thoughtful
little guy get em in paree

the blue

  he grinned no

  cn i see it

  he gave her the case she examined
both sides there were no initials

  pretty she handed it back leaned
outward with the cigarette clamped be-
tween her white teeth to meet the extended
flame inhaled deeply blew smoke at him
playfully and closed her lids they were
faintly blue

  somehow youre awful sympathetic
she whispered

  youve never told this stuff to anybody
before have you he asked

  the dusky eyes blinked and fixed them-
selves upon his with curious intensity
thats what i call a funny question
whats the little idea

  i was wondering thats all if you
intend sticking to this business you can
hardly afford to tell many folks might
blab dont you think

  she nodded eagerly but not too eagerly
now you said something you got
to have somebody to talk to in this game
its too dam exciting you get loaded up
with it got to spill over to somebody
the crook game is for pals or sweethearts
-not solitaire-players ill whisper some-
thing in your ear youre the first bird i
ever talked to who seems to get the idea
trust me to the limit he grinned
what happened next

  oh-got tired it seemed sort of
shabby like beaning some poor old lunk-
head with a sandbag thrill aint there
this is-different say i want you dis-
tinctly to understand i kissed good-by to
a sealskin cape when you took my mind
off that silverware

  he looked grieved maybe we can find
some other way of getting that sealskin
cape

  hurray yes yes go on 

  finish your story

  she settled back well then i did
some frisking working in a crowded l
train genrally gee but that was exciting-
for a while i used to pick out some rich-
looking sucker and flirt with him till he got
all excited and then the boys would close
in and go through him by the time he
started feeling around for his poke wed
be on an uptown train divvying the loot
but-aw that got on my nerves

che shut her eyes and endeavored nerv-
ously to blow rings wondering if her
audience was suspicious or merely prudent
book magazine

her pale lids opened part way he was
watching her expectantly with the ghost
of something swimming about in his eyes
was it suspicion mirth admiration
she looked more sharply it fled

   after that some of the gang began get-
ting fresh she plunged on i was grow-
ing up then i left them to fight it out
went to chi oh they know im back
but-hands off waiting theyll wait
for a thing they want till hell grows icicles
that bunch so i landed me a nice soft
little snap in a shirt-factory in chi i was
out for the reform stuff say it was rich
about eighteen hours a day and forty in-
sults a minute for twenty a week i de-
cided the narrow path wasnt ever built
for lillian feet are too broad

  what did you say your name was he
interrupted

   lillian de vere

  good stage-name he commented
mines bill

  she tried not to reveal her triumph he
was not even trying to conceal his name

  shall i spill some more she asked
excitedly you got me all wound up
if you will captain bill murmured
gee you certny do have the nicest
way of saying things well so i piled on
board a train and streaked it back to the
happy hunting-grounds you can imagine
how sweet and lovely i looked applying
for a chorus job after sleeping all those
hours on the red plush and cinders it
was noth-ing did-ding for lil lil so as
i was telling you i went and dug up dads
old kit and-well cashed in enough to fit
myself out like the queen o sheba if i
do say it myself lookit these silk
stockings cost fourteen berries a pair this
dress cost ninety like it the bad news
for this hat was sixty-five these kicks-
seventeen that sable coat out there-
three fifty on the hoof now-all to-
gether

  her mouth was a scarlet o good
taste you know what good taste is
perfect captain bill assured her

   she puffed contentedly at the cigarette
crushed it in a red lacquer tray pressed
her fingertips together smiled i ambled
back to the summer palace last week all
dolled up like this gee billy-all the
confidence in the world

  sure he grinned and now how
about this through fini

  aw billyum do i look through
  really like it eh

by george f worts



  hate it but money dont grow on
bushes not this season

   thats very true he said thoughtfully
what i want to do more than any-
thing she added trying not to watch him
too expectantly is to tie up with a top-
notch crook we could pull lots of real
classy jobs-big stuff i dont care how
good a man is a girl can help him in this
game a million ways

  captain bill was nodding indifferently
she felt exasperated why the man was
a gibraltar

  gee i cant help but think she went
on pensively what a fast team a fellow
like you and i could make think of the
tricks i could teach you and maybe i
just wouldnt like to learn to spill the eng-
lish language the way you do i need
polish im rough

  nonsense he said youre a won-
derfully clever girl-

  she disregarded him oh golly bil-
lyum why arent you in the burgling busi-
ness too

  her remarkable eyes were shining ad-
dressing upon him their most alluring glow

there followed a pause of sharp con-
fusion he had gotten up from his
chair was bending over her with warm
moist palms resting lightly on her knuckles
his expression was serious although that
former baffling spark had come into his
eyes and the comers of his red mouth and
his little dark mustache were twirking

  something is in the breeze she whis-
pered smiling up at him shyly but fear-
lessly youre the most changeable man
i ever knew whats up

  i am going to kiss you captain bill
announced do you mind

  you-aw youre impossible dyou
spose i let every tom dick and harry
that blows along have my kisses bill
you-you are sorta sweet but whats the
use you know how this little partys
going to-

  the ultimate word was smothered how
dry and hot his lips were her hands
fugitively pressed the back of his neck al-
most caressingly came together upon his
chest pushed him back stiffly she was
guiltily aware that the emotion stirred in
her breast by that contact was not the one
she had been prepared for she was not
filled with loathing at all but something
entirely different perhaps the boyish cor-
diality of his grin had undermined her dis-
captain bill comes home

taste for captain bill perhaps-but even
a clever woman sometimes has a difficult
time explaining herself to herself

  that was because you are a gentleman
she informed him getting back into her
role you have a way of understanding
a girl what did you say was your line
bill before you became a-a-soldier

  his cheeks were flushed his air had be-
come restless he seemed at last on the
point of breaking down and coming across

  stockbroker he said with gravity

  wall street

  captain bill nodded i dont want you
to be offended at what i say next

  she headed him off sweetly burglar
arent you bill her attitude was lazily
indifferent but every nerve in her body
was singing

  he considered this a long while puffing
dreamily at his cigarette he puckered his
lips he smiled at her through the drifting
smoke he nodded

  she could have screamed with relief
her eyes strayed jealously to the telephone
beside her she had merely to lift the
receiver a fraction of an inch downstairs
were detectives captained by jimmy evans
from the central station patiently waiting
for that flash but there was detailed data
to be secured before that

  tell me all about it  she cried why
billikens you dont know how grand it
makes me feel why cant we be pals

aptain bill seemed momentarily un-
 certain she felt sorry for him he
had such a fine good old-fashioned grin

  he leaned toward her sternly she felt
his tenseness was confused by the ardent
determination in his expression

  see here young woman captain bill
began in an intense ringing voice i in-
tend to take you in hand you dont real-
ize it yourself but you are a genius you
have the stuff in you for the making of a
marvelous emotional actress why youre
immense youre wonderful im not ex-
aggerating youve the knack or ability
of arousing sympathy more deeply than
any woman i have seen on any stage
youve made me fall in love with you-
without even trying his expression was
as hard as granite youre going to stop
being a crook understand youre going
to become a respectable citizen-right now
im going to see that you become the most
famous woman on the american stage-
as you deserve to be

the blue



  she was so bewildered so utterly flab-
bergasted that she could only open her
mouth and make a faint hissing sound in
her throat

  captain bills eyes were flashing like
sapphires

  went to see a new play tonight-
bridges uncrossed ingenue was the
image of you wonderful wonderful
sympathy but youre ten hundred times
better than june auburn was tonight if
i have to go to prison for life im going to
have the satisfaction of doing that one
thing-making you the greatest actress in
this country thats what i think of
you 

  the girls bewilderment turned to acid
bitterness she wanted to cry all of
her contempt for this crook masquerading
in a uniform with a wound chevron was
smothered a man who would offer to
sacrifice himself for a woman as this man
had offered himself for her could not be
bad at heart she could not positively
would not allow them to arrest this man

  with misty eyes in a strange choking
voice she said broadway bill youre a
rotter but i intend letting you escape i
wont have a hand in this if they can
catch you when you get outside-thats
not my business

  what dyou mean he snapped spring-
ing up

  this is a frame-up she whispered

  a frame-up good god

  sit down bill armstrong-

  go on he said sternly

  i am an actress i am june auburn
-the ingenue in bridges uncrossed
before i went on the stage i was on the
force for a while and tonight before the
show jimmy evans from the central sta-
tion came to my dressing-room and begged
me to help frame you he only suspected
you-of a long string of burglaries i
promised id try to make you blab well
i havent heard a word youve said if
you havent destroyed it already let me
have that correspondence-card the bellboy
handed you in the bellmore lobby

  in amazement the man extracted from
an inner pocket an oblong of folded gray
cardboard with a morningside drive
apartment address engraved in deep blue
across the top-the address of june
auburns apartment a firm businesslike
hand had composed the message

  dear old doc

bully for you old stick-in-the-mud by
book magazine

  all means try out my new apartment when-
  ever you hit town youll find plenty of pre-
  war scotch and rye under the silverware
  drawer in the sideboard everything to
  read in the library come up and use my
  apartment any night whether im in town
  or not key is enclosed am still keeping
  that rotten schedule-pittsburgh conferences
  every wednesday thursday friday make
  it monday or tuesday if you can but plan
  to use the apartment whenever you come

yours to a cinder

                         bob hale

  the card was dated tuesday april fif-
teenth and tonight was wednesday april
twenty-third

jwflss auburn tore up the card and
dropped the gray fragments into the
red tray no such persons as doc or bob
hale exist jim evans wrote that himself
this is my apartment we were sure youd
read that card and try for the silver she
added tearfully just as we were sure that
if i laid on that cooked-up story thick
enough youd confess

  she rose wearily now i want you to
get out of here slip out of that dining-
room window and up the fire-escape to the
roof im letting you go armstrong even
if you are contemptible enough to hide in
the uniform of heroes because youve
shown me that you-can be a man wont
you brace up-if youre not caught wont
you the tears were spilling out of her
eyes wont you take off that uniform
and be-decent-for me

  miss auburn i-i hardly- he stam-
mered with lowered head

  the ringing of the telephone cut him off
in terror the girl put the receiver to her
left ear her free hand over the mouth-
piece

 hurry she whispered you can
cross the roofs

   lo june jimmy talking announced
a lazy cheerful mans voice sorry that
frame wasnt necessary armstrongs girl
squealed and we landed both of em just
finished the squeegee process she got
patriotism all of a sudden and boiled over
about his wearing that uniform an-
june auburn sank back in her chair
limp wait a minute jim evans are
you positive has he an infantry captains
uniform on

  sure thing slick boy looked like
the regular article wound stripe an
everything hope you havent been wait-
ing up tell you all about it tmorrow
gotta run along much obliged gby

by george f worts



  the receiver landed upon the hook only
by accident june auburn turned two wild
eyes and one circular mouth upon her guest

  who in the world are you she de-
manded hysterically and where did you
come from

  the young man looked embarrassed
why im bill whalen of h r whalen
 son down on wall street im son
just got back from the reunion-

  miss auburn gulped where did you
find that note

  captain bill whalens embarrassment
increased a man in uniform-a captain
-slipped it into my hand in the times
square subway station while i was trying
to figure out that funny green line and
told me id dropped it and winked t
thought it was a joke you see some 
my friends are practical jokers and i-
always bite to keep them contented

  you didnt think this was a joke
miss auburn said indignantly

  sure  he grinned butit isnt is it
she fell back again as if her very soul
had been run over by a tank perhaps
why didnt you-say something

i was waiting for you to spring it
how dared you tell me youd keep on
being a burglar-for me she said severely

  captain bill blushed i was willing
he explained haltingly to be a burglar
you-that is-i meant what i said about
intending to make you a famous actress
i thought you were wonderful in bridges
uncrossed tonight-

  gracious miss auburn bounced up
from the char you didnt recognize me
when you came into the dining-room 

  he grinned foolishly sure theres
no one like you in the world i did have
a deuce of a time trying to figure it all-
the girl stopped him she had made a
belated discovery why youre real
she cried clapping her hands that
wound chevron is genuine its true
she was mixing her tears with smiles-and
only great actresses dare try that you
poor boy where were you wounded
how when dear

  a curved chunk of h e-argonne
he told her in a voice of heroic modesty
ill show it to you he was pulling up
the sleeve of his left arm

  miss auburn clutched his fingers and
stared pityingly there it was an inch
or so below his elbow joint on the white
side of his muscular forearm the scar was
of a curved shape the shape of a grin
the bumbershoot

     a writer endowed with a lively sense of humor here tells the
     joyous story of what befell a timid gentleman at large on a
     dark night in the company of a bottle and an umbrella

by everett rhodes castle

mr alfred gosney stood on
the stoop of the residence of his
brother-in-law mr thomas lint
in aspinwall road and uttered the con-
ventional farewell words of gratification in-
cidental to the end of a pleasant evening
he grasped his heavy old-fashioned um-
brella in one hand and held a heavy pack-
age wrapped loosely in newspaper under
the other elbow thus he found it difficult
to clasp the extended hand of his host it
was a trivial thing and yet mr gosney
blushed awkwardly in the confusion caused
by the necessity of shifting the old-fash-
ioned umbrella to his left hand

  gosh alf guess youll never get over
being all thumbs his host laughed
loudly

  mrs lint from her position in the door-
way tittered pleasantly

  mr gosney agreed with a weak little
laugh he did not relish being called alf
it sounded like a comical tramp or some
other humorous variety of roadside ruffian

  sorry about the other alf mr lint
continued but you know how it is

  just like children mrs lint appended

when you want them to they wont and
when you dont care they do it beauti-
fully

  why nights when we are here alone
mr lint continued enthusiastically we
get california clear as a bell dont we
stella

  clearer said mrs lint you can
hear that announcer say station kzp
san francisco as clear as if he was right
in the next room instead of being hundreds
of thousands of miles away

  of course the difference in time makes
it kind of awkward if you have guests
mr lint smiled tolerantly twelve
oclock here is only eight oclock out there
funny aint it

  mr gosney did not think so but he
managed to smile feebly he wished for
the moment at least that he was in cali-
fornia he would just be finishing the eve-
ning paper there in an hour he would
be comfortably in bed

  but not as funny as radio his host
persisted why alf think of it five
thousand miles away is just like being in
your own comfortable little home
the bumbershoot

e

  mr gosney thought of his own comfort-
able little home only two miles away and
groaned inwardly

  well he muttered guess ill be
going

  sorry our car is laid up alf id run
you over pretty late and with all this
crime-talk about too bad

  mr gosney shuddered gently he tried
to think how long it had been since he was
out this late at night alone lint made
him tired he couldnt remember be-
sides he would hurry in the meantime
it was getting later-earlier rather mr
gosney shuddered again

  good night he said quickly

  mrs lint crowded to the fore give
my love to agnes she called tell her
we were so sorry she couldnt come but
you both must come again soon maybe
well have better luck getting california

  mr gosney nodded mechanically a
street-lamp near by had sputtered and died
out leaving the surrounding territory in
absolute blackness

  tell her said mr lint with brotherly
indifference that summer colds dont
amount to anything if you get right after
them that wine of stellas will fix her up

  be careful warned his wife the
paper is full of holdups walk in the
middle of the street

  alf is all right whod dare to stop
him with that bumbershoot in his hand
mr lint laughed

  mr gosney laughed too-a shrill nerv-
ous little bit of laugh which did not in-
dicate that the confidence so loudly ex-
pressed by mr lint in the old-fashioned
umbrella had any foundation in fact-as
far as mr alfred gosney was concerned

  he stepped down into the night the
front door of the lint residence closed with
a resounding whang

jvtr gosney was alone in the darkness
with his bottle of stellas elderberry
wine and what her husband was pleased to
term a bumbershoot the combination
was not particularly reassuring

  mr gosney shivered presently he
shifted the heavy package to a more secure
position under his left arm and returned
the umbrella to his right hand grasping the
stout shaft firmly through the heavy folds
of cloth

  through beetling clouds a pale sliver of
moon was visible for the moment a mere
handful of stars were scattered ineffectually

by everett rhodes castle

about the sky like japanese lanterns at a
church lawn-fete

  under the first twittering arc-light mr
gosney produced his watch and by careful
shifting of the quart bottle of elderberry
contrived to snap open the cover it was
ten minutes to one and bolton road was
a good two miles-nearer three mr gos-
ney decided gloomily the heavy gold
case of the old-fashioned hunter gleamed
rather richly in the flickering light men
had been murdered-without number-for
considerably less big men some of
them bom fighters probably but caught
from behind without warning disregard-
ing the safety of the elderberry in his
haste mr gosney managed to stow the
glittering token of robbery and sudden
death in the upper pocket of his natty silk
vest as far as he could see down the lonely
street no person was visible-only a patch
of yellow light here and there to denote
some householder burning the midnight oil
mr gosney began to hurry as fast as his
short little legs permitted and as he
hurried he cursed

  he muttered first against summer colds
why did people have them and agnes
of all people it showed a lack of some-
thing mr gosney thought it was judg-
ment with a little of that agnes would
be puffing along at his side her generous
girth a buckler her vigorous voice a shield
mr gosney laughed bitterly instead
where was she at least three miles away
maybe more in a soft comfortable bed
most likely snoring like a grampus or
was it a wampus mr gosney did not
know he became wistful if he was only
there to hear her snore and utter the harm-
less little noises which sounded like a reci-
tation of the vowels

  he gave consideration to the lints a
family singularly devoid of all common
sense a male relative with the habit of
giving his name-a plain decent name-a
suggestion of small beer and trouser
patches radio imbeciles why in the
name of thunder hadnt he spoken up at
ten-thirty what did he care about cali-
fornia being as clear as a bell bell
rhymed with what he really thought about
it they were all alike anyway-like a
pair of cats in a barrel kzp indeed
at eleven-thirty he should have shouted for
pdq

  mr gosney smiled grimly at that it
was rather clever he would tell it to
agnes
the bumbershoot

cuddenly from an adjacent back yard
a wail of mortal anguish fell upon the
stillness of the night mr gosney felt his
neck swell and his lungs contract his feet
gripped the flagging as if the stone were
lode instead of sand the wail was re-
peated it died in a hissing gurgling fash-
ion as a cry for help might die in the grasp
of pressing fingers murderous fingers a
bolt of black dashed out of the driveway
mr gosney found his feet capable of sud-
den locomotion he began to run whipped
by the breeze of his sudden flight the news-
paper covering of the elderberry bottle
fluttered to the rear for nearly a block
mr gosney continued his mad race before
the thing was clear cats he stopped
out of breath and sweating

  heck he swore

  the cold neck of the bottle was un-
familiar mr gosney brought it slowly
into view slowly it dawned upon him
that the shining piece of purple glass
placed him clearly without the pale of law
as the confidential clerk for going on to
fifteen years in the legal offices of trant
miller trant  queeley mr gosney knew
exactly where he stood he was no longer
a law-abiding citizen returning from a
gathering at an advanced hour and entitled
as a taxpayer to the full protection of
every policeman in the city in the eyes of
every bluecoat he was a criminal skulking
through the night with the merchandise of
crime grasped firmly under his arm ex-
hibit a

  mr gosney stared back into the gloom
with quivering lips the newspaper was
nowhere in sight

  shucks he wailed

  he began to hurry again to go back and
search was doubly dangerous the darn
cats had probably aroused the neighbor-
hood to hurry might also be dangerous
suspicious an idea presented itself mr
gosney placed the bottle seemingly grown
heavier under his coat and clasped it
against the natty waistcoat with his free
hand but the length of the bottle-it had
originally contained a full quart of imperia
vinegar-bunched the front of his coat and
tilted the rear in such fashion that even
a child in arms would have scented crime
mr gosney took the bottle out and swung
it by the neck as he walked along no
one was in sight

  gosney he told himself dont be a
fool maybe you wont meet anybody be
calm

the blue

  words weak futile things suppose
he did meet a policeman or an innocent-
looking plain-clothes man what good was
calmness in the face of a bottle of purple
fluid being conveyed through the night--or
rather morning

dut there was another way out a toss
into the gloom and he was a citizen
and a taxpayer again entitled to the pro-
tection and benefits of law and order the
stuff might stain the landscape if the bottle
broke which was unlikely because of its
thickness but the gosney reputation would
remain unblemished probably in-
jurious too what did the lints know
about making wine-or anything else for
that matter

  nothing mr gosney assured the
night-or morning positively nothing

  thrown into the gutter or a convenient
field no damage could possibly result to
anyone ic was logical it fitted the emer-
gency it safeguarded health and morals

  on the other hand agnes had said
tell stella to send me a bottle of her
elderberry wine i need the strengthen-
ing

  mr gosney gripped the neck of the bot-
tle tighter that was that

  at the corner of aspinwall road and
clermont avenue mr gosney turned to
the right to the left gleaming car-rails
sped into the distance curving around from
the upper end of aspinwall road if they
only curved the other way and a brightly
illuminated street car would appear mr
gosney consoled himself with the meager
comfort that wishing never got anybody
anywhere

  clermont avenue was a much older de-
velopment the frame houses with their
picket fences were rapidly giving way to
slattern flats and brick buildings devoted
to light manufacturing dark alleys began
to peep out from unexpected angles cau-
tion suggested the middle of the road but
the bottle of stellas elderberry wine sug-
gested the comforting shadows which
cloaked the inner edge of the sidewalk
behind him a night-owl car turned the cor-
ner and clanged eastward mr gosney
turned for a moment and eyed the depart-
ing radiance wistfully clermont avenue
became darker and more sinister he es-
sayed a cheery whistle

  at his best in the comfortable legal at-
mosphere of trant miller trant 
queeley mr alfred gosney was a timid
book magazine



apologetic little man he had the partially
bald head the wistful eye and the straw-
gray mustache of our old friend common
people of the daily cartoon he was pre-
cise without being pursy he upheld the
dignity of the firm without treading on
anyones toes-even the bustling impor-
tant young blackstones fresh from their
examinations he affected a terseness of
expression and a compression of words as
being crisp and executive he possessed
a high regard for peace at any price and
a deep-seated horror of all things involving
loud talk loud clothes loud laughter and
actions of any kind which might be con-
strued as coming under the same adjective

   he did not care for baseball even as a
young man or any of the various sports
which involved violent exercise some-
times of a sunday he and agnes would
visit one of the city parks and watch a
game of roque but not often agnes did
not care to walk

  in his reading mr gosney preferred the
same quiet lurid stories of crime which
agnes devoured he ignored entirely-or
as completely as possible agnes at times
had a way of forcing his attention by read-
ing aloud some particularly sanguinary bit
of current news

   mr gosney strove to forget the last few
which agnes had been pleased to read
aloud one story in particular seemed to
vie with the menace of stellas bottle of
elderberry wine in his mind an old man
had been tied to a chair by thugs who
thrust needles under his nails in a futile
effort to obtain a supposed hidden store of
wealth

a belated automobile turned a corner
a few blocks ahead and winked its little
red eye derisively upon reaching that
block mr gosney calculated with slightly
rising spirits that he would be practically
half-way home

  and then hardly a hundred feet away a
blue-coated figure stepped from the dark-
ness to the bleary light of a street-lamp
and moved majestically forward the
light gleamed for a moment on the buttons
of his coat and the polished nightstick

  mr gosney stopped dead

   despite his long connection with the law
mr gosney did not feel the contempt usu-
ally associated with such intimacy he
leaned against the projecting wall of a
laundry and sought to think behind the
advancing bluecoat stalked fort leaven-

by everett rhodes castle

worth with frowning battlements and
khaki-clad guards and the publicity
even when moments were infinitely pre-
cious mr gosney devoted several to con-
templating the full horror of four-column
photographs to his disordered brain no
news-event would loom larger

   large drops of perspiration stood out on
the little mans forehead his little round
cloth hat seemed to grip his head like a
band of steel

  he thought of running but the nearest
alley was back beyond a street-light a
man with a large quart bottle was bad
enough-but-but a  man with a large
quart bottle running spelled disaster in
screaming characters

   it was velvet blackness in the sheltering
lee of the laundry mr gosney was sure
that as yet he had escaped notice from the
advancing guardian of the peace in a mo-
ment of madness he thought of hurling the
thing far across the street into shattering
oblivion but there was the noise

  with a trembling hand mr gosney en-
deavored to wipe the moisture from his
clammy brow the motion brought the
curved handle of the ancient umbrella in
sharp contact with the little cloth hat it
was almost as if the umbrella itself had
sought to whisper the words of inspiration

  with hands which trembled perilously
close to the point of uselessness mr gos-
ney tried the idea out carefully he low-
ered stellas bottle of elderberry into the
capacious folds of the umbrella with
eager care he held the bottle in position
while he grasped the neck and the shaft
from without the thing was possible
the weight in his hand bore heavily on his
wrist but the effect as far as he could
judge in the gloom was entirely plausible

  he stepped forward again

the minion of the law was almost upon
him now he could hear the heavy
breathing as well as the paddle of the
heavy feet mr gosney wondered if he
should start to whistle something light
and unconcerned

  the unaccustomed weight supported
only by wrist and fingers already seemed
insupportable because of its shape de-
signed to display to the best advantage the
amber beauty of imperia vinegar the
handle of the umbrella could not be made
to hug the sides of the bottle in a few
seconds this combined with the necessity
of keeping the bottle within the folds of the
the bumbershoot

umbrella brought added strain mr gos-
ney set his little jaw grimly but on sec-
ond thought he smoothed the grimness
away it was replaced by a wooden effort
of jovial unconcern

  evening officer mr gosney wished
he had said captain

  evenin he was a great big lump of
a man and under ordinary circumstances
mr gosney would have thought him a
rather friendly-looking chap in a lumpish
sort of way

  nice evening eh

  yes sir-r the policeman saw a fright-
ened little man whose face was thinly
masked by a sickly smile but an honest
little face-a little man with a big um-
brella your-re out late he finished
mr gosney nodded

  live around-d here

  over on belmont street

  the policeman nodded and swung his
nightstick idly mr gosney wondered if
it would look suspicious to hurry on his
wrist seemed filled with hot lead

  the representative of the law wondered
why the little man lingered unless- he
smiled indulgently he would reassure the
little man

  some bumbershoot you have there

  mr gosney held himself erect by main
force of will he tried desperately to
speak but the words would not disentangle
themselves his legs trembled violently

  a bad wallop-p you could give a crook
with that

  yes managed mr gosney

  not that any will be met with on this
beat just like a rest-cure it is that
ought to help the little man

  apparently it did he smiled wanly
g-good night officer

  good night sir-r only be mindful of
the alleys

  mr gosney said he would-in tones not
to be doubted the bluecoat smiled and
passed on little men like that were like
children the law shouldkeep them in
after nine oclock

jwr gosney hurried after a block he

	eased the burning wrist by shifting the
burden to a position under his left arm and
clutching it firmly to his side once more
he sought the gleaming hunter

  the hands pointed to one thirty-five

  he moved along more cheerfully almost
with bravado the man was probably
right in the gloom a crook might take the

the blue

umbrella for almost any sort of a weapon-
maybe a rifle

  at the corner of clermont and duane
streets he turned north into duane duane
street would presently flow into belmont
avenue and he mr gosney would be
home again he thought of stellas part-
ing words come again soon

  the more he thought about it the more
the humor of the thing appealed he for-
got all about the irony of stellas words in
considering how he would polish the thing
up in the form of a neat little anecdote be-
ginning well one night i was coming
home pretty late with a bottle of contra-
band under my arm when i run straight
into a policeman and ending up and i
walked right out from under his nose and
him with his eyes glued to my umbrella
practically all the time

  mr gosney began to whistle not a false
note of courage or a touch of camouflage
but the light-hearted effort of a man who
sees the worst in a fading perspective
duane street was a narrow rather ill-kept
street filled with makeshift stores and
garages whose narrow drives were filled
with rusted and battered skeletons of auto-
mobiles long past the stage of pep and
class numerous alleys intersected it also
forming tubes of impenetrable blackness
against the half-light of the street

  but mr gosney moved jauntily forward
the fears which beset the early part of his
homeward journey seemed-well perhaps
not so much foolish as unwarranted after
all a bottle of elderberry wine was a
mighty small thing especially when made
by the righteous wife of a stanch citizen
and taxpayer thus mr gosney in the
bigness of his heart came to forgive the
lints for their unwarranted insistence in
his waiting for california to come in clear
as a bell they meant well

derhaps in a few more strides mr

   gosney might have forgiven summer
colds but the weight under his left arm
asserted itself mr gosney moved the um-
brella back to its original position and
grasped the bottle as he had grasped it
before-only for the moment just to get
the effect again

  he was studying the cleverness of it with
a complacent little smile of approbation
for the hair-trigger brain which had con-
ceived it when a sudden shadow fell across
his path-a shadow which moved with the
agile litheness of some giant cat

  only mr gosney knew without lodking
up that this was no animal

  brother said a silken voice pass me
the time

  mr gosney slowly brought his head
around to the base of the shadow he
found himself staring at a man not so
much taller than himself but immeasurably
broad never had mr gosney seen such
shoulders or such a neck as was vouchsafed
him in that twinkling moment of time a
giant gorilla with a lowered cloth cap and
the familiar sweater popularly associated
with thugdom

  well brother the voice was still
soft but its caress was full of menace

  mr gosney tugged the hunter free with
a trembling left hand the right held the
ancient umbrella and its cargo-forgotten

  t-ten m-minutes t-to t-two

  the other grinned mr gosney never
recalled such terrifying merriment

  i dont believe it let me see it
brother

  trembling without thought of conceal-
ment mr gosney sought to free the chain
and its walrus-tooth charm the walrus
tooth perhaps because of the close associa-
tion of years clung tenaciously to the natty
vesting

  with a genial grin and the quickness and
strength of the aforementioned kitten the
other reached out and tore the watch and
a generous portion of the natty vesting
from the stricken grasp of the confidential
clerk of trant miller trant  queeley

  step on it he said

  mr gosney watched the other slip the
watch into the side pocket of his coat with
a sigh of regret the hunter had been a
present from agnes on the occasion of their
tenth anniversary he dropped his hand

  none of that the apelike figure was
instantly suspicious and alert put em
up up an hold em up the voice was
a snarl now

dreathing as one winded from run-
ning with the perspiration again drip-
ping from his brow mr gosney mechani-
cally elevated his hands the effort to
raise the ancient umbrella with its liquid
contents was nothing compared to the
fright and fear of mortal injury which the
other inspired the little man was a
pathetic spectacle with his trembling reed-
like arms upright one supporting an an-
cient umbrella held rigidly erect the gen-
tleman grinned in good-natured contempt

he felt like saying boo to see if the
little man would faint dead away but
business before pleasure

  mr gosney felt the other go through his
coat with expert lightness from nothing
the weight in his right hand became un-
bearable with clenched teeth he sought to
keep the quivering wrist rigid and the fin-
gers to their grip he opened his mouth
to say-to explain-

  shut up said the other curtly ill
be through in a minute

  mr gosney made one more supreme ef-
fort he took the person at his word and
counted off the necessary sixty seconds
but the other was still busy going through
the papers of an inner pocket bending for-
ward until the cloth cap almost came in
contact with the remnants of the natty
vesting for quicker and more accurate
work

  something snapped within mr alfred
gosney to this day he cannot quite ex-
plain it without thinking-almost with-
out knowing-he brought the umbrella with
its heavy quart burden down on the capped
head just at the base of the massive corded
neck the blow was delivered with aston-
ishing vigor the figure dropped like a
sack of meal cast from a freight-car-inert
and apparently without articulation

  for a moment mr gosney could only
stare with the umbrella sagging in his
twitching hand

  suddenly from the head of duane street
came the shrill call of a police whistle
and the sound of pounding feet mr gos-
ney thought fast if the man was dead
and he looked very dead the thing was
bound to be unpleasant at best the pub-
licity would be terrible-terrific and
there was the bottle always there was
the bottle mr gosney peered down the
street again the whistle sounded the
man lay without moving mr gosney
fumbled with his chin from the direction
of clermont avenue came an answering
blast

  quickly mr gosney stooped over and
picked up his wallet from the ground he
grabbed a stray paper which had fluttered
from the mans hand he turned to run-
anywhere-only to remember his watch
the pounding feet grew nearer he bent
and placed his hand in the side pocket of
the mans coat and drew the watch out
the piece of natty vesting was still at-
tached to the walrus tooth he stood erect
and gazed wildly into darkness
the bumbershoot

t

  across the street an alley skirted a two-
story brick garage hugging the umbrella
to his breast mr gosney ran as  fast as
his little legs permitted toward its narrow
shelter

  a hoarse voice called upon him to halt
but mr gosney was definitely committed
to a policy of flight it was useless to stop
now he-he-

  from behind him came a report like a
bursting automobile tire mr gosney
leaped forward like a stricken doe in-
stinctively he felt that the patrolman had
fired his revolver he stumbled through
the unfamiliar darkness at a surprising rate
of speed from behind he heard men ex-
changing shouts the umbrella in some
way crept between his legs and threw him
heavily into the dirt

as he stood up he heard the patrolman
 enter the alley behind him running
heavily he began to run again thinking
of the wildest things he felt the sensa-
tions of a drowning man who sees the
events of his past life pass in review before
he goes down for the last time he thought
of agnes in her comfortable bed uttering
her somnambulistic vowels he thought of
the lints and california which came in as
clear as a bell when guests were absent
lastly he thought of the quart bottle of
stellas elderberry wine clutched to his
breast in the protecting folds of the um-
brella

  from behind came another command to
stop it was followed almost immediately
by another explosion mr gosney heard
the bullet whistle in the air unused to
violent exercise his heart was beginning to
pound he breathed heavily through the
nose but still he held the umbrella
clutched to his breast

  strangely enough he was not so fright-
ened now as he was back on clermont
street under the friendly eye of the other
policeman-doubtless the cop of the an-
swering whistle mr gosney found him-
self thinking of his pursuer as a cop-of
all police officers as cops he thought
of himself as a sublime martyr to a bottle
of elderberry wine done up in an umbrella
a grim determination seized him he
would deliver the bottle to agnes or die in
the attempt he tried to set his jaw on
the determination but his bursting lungs
would not permit the pounding footsteps
kept on behind

  without warning the alley ended in

the blue

what was evidently the storage yard of a
blacksmith shop a high board fence old
and rickety but still erect blocked a nar-
row passage which evidently led to the
street beyond mr gosney thought of hid-
ing in a broken-down dump-wagon but
the thing was too obvious the footsteps
grew nearer

  mr gosney found an old wagon-wheel
lying up against the fence still clutching
the umbrella he managed to clamber to
the hub with one knee safely over the
wheel began to roll it rolled far enough
to leave mr gosney suspended precari-
ously on the creaking boards with a
mighty effort he managed to pull himself
erect but the effort allowed no chance of
balance and he fell heavily into a collec-
tion of empty cans and packing boxes
which lined the fence on the other side

tor a moment he lay stunned amid the

  unsavory collection when he managed
to stand erect something warm was trick-
ling down his hand but the bottle was
safe mr gosney smiled triumphantly
as he moved away being careful to do so
noiselessly he heard the other-the cop-
run heavily into the yard he came to a
concrete passage which led into the street

  mr gosney knew the street well it
was payne avenue he was within two
blocks of home home mr gosney
sighed the street was well lighted-too
well lighted except for the extremely right-
eous perhaps in the illumination mr
gosney discovered a long triangular tear in
the left leg of his best trousers for the
moment the catastrophe halted him in his
tracks agnes mr gosney shivered in
spite of the sweat which streamed from
under his jammed cloth hat

  the noise of a heavy body straining be-
hind him substituted fear for terror in the
little watery blue eyes sternly mr gos-
ney told himself that this was not the mo-
ment to think of haberdashery

  he limped rather than ran across the
street where a vacant lot provided a
thoroughfare to another alley which paral-
leled belmont avenue to the rear once
more in the shadows of a continuous line
of high board fences mr gosney broke into
a halting combination of lope and trot
three hundred feet eastward lay the back
fence of the gosney domicile three hun-
dred more steps and he would be at the
little door which was used for ashes and
rubbish three hundred more feet
book magazine



   he passed the freshly painted portion of
the fence belonging to one paul oreilly
his next door neighbor behind him came
another blast of a cops whistle with
desperate energy he tugged at the rusty
latch it opened with a loud protesting
squeak mr gosney fell through the open-
ing

   he followed the walk around to the front
of the house tiptoed up the front steps
and cautiously inserted his key into the
lock the door opened with gratifying
smoothness mr gosney closed it the
same way from above came the resonant
somnambulistic vowels mr gosney leaned
back against the door

  he was home

   presently he moved carefully across the
room it was dark but familiar territory

at the foot of the stairs where a door
opened into the kitchen he stepped warily

a large jardiniere used as an umbrella-re-
ceptacle was close at hand he endeavored
to disengage the bottle of elderberry in
order to place it on the kitchen table but
something happened something slipped
with a crash like low-flung thunder mr
gosney went down taking with him the
jardiniere and stellas bottle a liquid
began to spread itself over mr gosneys
person it was warm and sticky

  mr gosney was home

ivir gosney came down to breakfast
with a propitiatory smile on his
trembling lips mrs agnes gosney was
presiding over the breakfast service with
majestic calm

   good morning mdear

   mrs gosney nodded alfred she said
now that you have had a calm night of
rest i want you to tell me what resulted
in your terrible state

  i-i slipped murmured mr gosney
weakly thats-thats all i know
agnes

  h-m

  in-in fact mdear i was trying so
hard not to wake you

  wake me mrs gosney pursed her
lips sadly why i never slept a wink
until long after you had gone to bed

  mr gosney forgot the vowels and
nodded softly

   in fact his spouse went on i might
have known something would happen to
you when i told you to bring me the bottle
from stellas-being all thumbs the way
you are alfred

by everett rhodes castle

  mr gosney gulped hastily at his cereal
yes mdear he said

  mrs gosney picked up the morning
paper and perused it over her ample
bosom well she cried presently of
all terrible things

  how mdear

  just listen to this alfred and right
close to home too mrs gosney clucked
her tongue at the horror of it

  what mdear

  a persons life is no longer safe on the
street after dark and can you imagine it
and right on duane street too

  mr alfred gosney dropped his spoon
and coughed into his napkin what-
what- he stammered

  alfred just listen to this why just
to think it might have happened to you
why it is terrible why dont the police
do something

  a-a-a-another robbery mdear
another robbery well just listen to
this and right on duane street remem-
ber alfred mrs gosney adjusted her
glasses the better to do full justice to the
horror of it  brutal assault to rob in
duane street  she read slowly

   early this morning a man giving his
name as james biff mcgline 
cornhill avenue formerly a well-known
figure in the boxing world and later prom-
inent in east ward politics was found
lying unconscious in duane street s w
the man had been felled by a vicious
blow from some heavy instrument wrapped
in cloth

   according to mcglines story he was
stopped by a man and asked for the time
as mcgline was reaching for his watch
the assailant struck patrolman halloran
saw a man standing over the prostrate
figure and blowing his whistle for help
ran toward the scene of the crime the
assailant hearing the whistle fled through
an adjacent alley closely pursued by hal-
loran who discharged his revolver several
times apparently without effect

   flying squadrons have been dispatched
to all portions of the underworld and an
arrest is confidently expected 

  mrs gosney tossed her head with vigor-
ous approval i certainly hope they get
him she averred of all the brutal
things the poor man a wretch like
that ought to be sent up for life dont
you think so alfred

  yes mdear said mr gosney cer-
tainly absolutely

           you cant keep a good man-or a good dog-down as rex
           clearly demonstrates in this fine story of a wonderful
           dog whose acquaintance our readers have already made

 v ou la la

  jean la jennette american through
choice but stamped by a hundred genera-
tions of basque ancestors curled his stub
legs around the second rail of the fence
and chanted a paan of springtime exulta-
tion

  before him five thousand sheep packed
into a vibrating mass hugged the fence
of the shearing-pens feeding into the in-
closure behind the bell burro spilling
through the gates like sand through an
inverted hour-glass from the flanks and
from behind came the sharp whoofs of the
sheep-dog then of a sudden the vibrat-
ing mass relaxed jammed and the flow
through the gates choked back into the
sheep-pack the long-eared burro leading
the way had forgotten his bell-call func-
tion and had stopped to consider a pesky
fly and to mull his troubles into a burro
slumber the sun was good this morning
-and what was better than sleep

  ou la la sang the proud jean la
  jennette now you watch zat tam dog

  rex

    at the instant a brownish-black shep-
  herd trotted about the edge of the flock
  sniffed significantly and looked quizzically
  at the gates the pack was immobile
  jammed the tinkle of the bell ahead had
  ceased and the bleating of the flock had
  lapsed into a diminishing monotone jean
  la jennette rolled a cigarette and said not
  a word but when the dog reached the
  gates and stood up with his forepaws upon
  the nearest sheep he turned his attention
  to the burro the dog was looking across the
  fleecy carpet with a sort of now-i-won-
  der- whats- the- matter- with- that- darned-
  burro expression his head bent sidewise
  and one ear cocked then he leaped upon
  the packed backs and trotted over the
  sheep to the slumbering one next in-
  stant his teeth had sunk into the hocks
  and the burro his tail jammed between
  his legs was scooting across the pen
  whereupon rex leaped upon the sheep
  
old rex retires

 backs and trotted across the moving car-
 pet to his stand outside

  ou la la sang jean la jennette
never you beat zat tam dog

 three minutes later the flock in the
  pen rex had curled up in proud dignity
 beneath the feet of the glowing jean la
 jennette the other herders-those who
 went with the sheep and who had
 gathered about while the dog worked the
 flock-crowded in jean la jennette lapsed
 into his favorite basque pouring out the
 poetical lingo that every one of his an-
 cestors from the day of the uncrossed
 iberian down has sung to his favorite
 sheep-dog never was there a dog like
 rex never was there his equal nowhere
 was there a dog that was so like a man
 nor was there one in the country that
 could approach him in value had not
 baptiste pischotte offered jeans boss
 bob arnold five thousand dollars in piled
 gold for the bob-tailed rex ah zat bob-
 tail ou la in every litter of thorough-
 bred sheep-dogs there should be two or
 three and the hairs under the chin ou
 la again after you passed three every
 hair was worth a thousand dollars rex
 had seven baptiste had counted them
 and he knew but bob had counted them
 too and not for all his sheep would he sell
 zat tam dog	

   the herders clad in blue overalls that
 never came to the tops of their brogans
 and capped in weird-colored side-cocked
 tam-o-shanters harkened to the tale that
 each spring flowed out of the lips of the
 voluble jean la jennette as long as the
 shearing lasted jean and his dog would
 reign supreme no other herder would
 think of using his own dogs while jennette
 sat upon the fence and there was none
 who even entertained the wish accus-
 tomed as they were to all grades of sheep-
 dog intelligence these basques relished the
 marvel of the old dogs intuition once a
 year they came and once a year jean and
 his dog put on a little world series of herd-
 ing with jean singing during the intervals
 of the flocks

by austin hall



  and there was reason for all of old
jeans exultation rex was all that was
claimed of him no dog in western
america had a greater reputation and
none had such a value wherever the
sheep-shearers camped on their great an-
nual circle and the sheep-men gathered
there were sure to be tales of arnolds rex
and as the stories had spread many a
great sheep-grower had thrust a string-
spreading thumb into his heavy wallet
but it seldom availed because as jean
put it only one dog was allowed to mother
the pups of the famous sire

  the master of rex bob arnold was
next to miller  lux the greatest sheep-
grower in the san joaquin valley with a
range that ran over one hundred thousand
acres and sheep that were counted in high
digits of five figures bob had inherited
the business from his father and had been
born and reared in the hot lands but he
had married a pretty sprig from the coast
who having discovered that she could not
withstand the rigors of the interior climate
had taken up her home in the beautiful
town of san jose just beyond the moun-
tains wherefore bob arnold had become
a half-absentee proprietor and the guid-
ance of old rex had devolved wholly
upon jean la jennette it was a suitable
arrangement to the dog and to the herder
and all would have been well had bob
allowed matters to stand as they were
but there were children and the children
wanted the dog wherefore bob arnold
indulgent father that he was easily per-
suaded himself that it was no more than
his duty to retire the old fellow to a life
of tender morsels rex was getting old
and of late bob had noticed that what-
ever the dogs sagacity he had been
showing signs of fagging snap and vitality
the old fellow was his dearest possession
and as he had worked well he had surely
earned the right to live well

vne morning wnen bob arnold arrived
 at the ranch he found jean and rex
or rather jean and rex and a goat loading
freight-cars the sun was burning out of
a copper sky and the mutton flock dun-
colored and dusty was packed against the
fence stretched along the track the long
line of cars awaited the cargo of sheep
jean la jennette had just opened the door
of another car and without a word of
bidding the old dog proud as a peacock
his stub tail up had marched to the side
old rex retires



the blue

of the sheep-pack behind him came the
educated bell goat munching one of jeans
discarded tobacco sacks in the nonchalant
fashion of his treacherous caste the
sheep milled under the rising dust-cloud
and watched out of their flat-slitted eyes
then with the precision of an expert the
dog cut out his cargo of mutton and stood
back to appraise the number-following
which the traitor goat placed himself at
the head and led the way back to the
shute with the dog behind and the bell
in front the sheep had perforce to follow
that is the way of sheep up the way
chewing the sack went the goat and
through the door then he turned to his
left and followed along the wall until he
had made the circuit of the car and had
come back to the entrance the stupid
sheep followed when the last one had
entered the good-natured basque let out
the goat and closed the door

  ou la la the beaming jean called to
his boss it ees wat you call ze team-
play zat do ze work

  many times had bob arnold stood wit-
ness to the near-human intelligence of his
marvelous sheep-dog but never had he
been more interested had he a right to
separate the dog from the sheep-herder

nevertheless next day when the
  mutton had been loaded and the slack
season was on he whistled to rex and
called him into the seat of his expensive
roadster he had purposely delayed his
explanation to jean la jennette-purpose-
ly because he knew that there was no ex-
planation possible had he told his whole
plan he would have lost the best sheep-
man west of the rockies and even as it
was he did not get away from old jean
bob had hardly settled the old dog into
the seat before jean la jennette came out
waving his battered tam-o-shanter

  ah monsieur wat you do wiz zat
tam dog where you go eh

  bob would have given anything to avoid
that moment he loved old jean where-
fore his prevarication may be forgiven

  i am just taking him over to the
kiddies jean-for a few days only old
rex is getting old im going to take him
over and feed him up then with a
smile mebbe ill retire him

  old jeans hands went into the air
sapristi he said wat you say
mil detnonios you retire heem wat
will jean la jennette do wiz ze sheep

you retire zat tam dog you kill heem
sure you kill ze good jean la jennette
also zat dog he boss ze dogs and ze
sheep jean la jennette he boss ze man
jean la jennette an zat tam dog make tam
goot team

  bob laughed but old jean would have
to do without his dog so he lied again

  just for a few days jean

  nevertheless when the old dog shifted
his splendid brown-black body on the seat
holding up his paw and lapping the tears
from the sheep-herders cheek bob won-
dered whether after all the man might
not be right what would old rex be
without jean and the sheep then he
remembered the kids-and stepped on the
starter when he looked back old jean
was standing disconsolately in the road-
way

  old rex loved sheep but next to sheep
he loved to ride in the big roadster many
times had bob arnold called him into the
seat and whizzed him into the mountains
where at the end of every ride there had
always been sheep-a flock to be herded
from the plateau pastures out onto the
dusty plains or again some herder who
had had trouble with a younger dog and
had sent in for the experienced rex it
was always good to crouch upon the seat
where he could watch the whizzing road
out of his tan-brown eyes and where he
could feel the touch of his master beside
him so on this day when they came to
the mountains he sat upon his haunches
and scented the breeze that drifted down
the gulches-looking for sheep when he
turned his old eyes up at his master bob
arnold seemed to understand

  old fellow said bob arnold you
are looking for sheep arent you but
this time you are not going to find them
we are going over to dog heaven where
an old dog like you will have nothing to
do but sleep

  rex felt his ear being pulled and he
knew by the tone of his masters voice
that there was something new in the wind
they had come to the summit of the
mountains and as he scented the air he
was aware of a strange vacancy the soft
scent of the desert had given way to a faint
tang of salt and there were no sheep-
nothing but a rolling vista of hills that ran
down into the blue-bordered distance
nevertheless he was satisfied because bob
sat at the wheel and he knew that after
while they must come to the flocks they
book magazine



always did-all the world was centered
about sheep so he curled up in the seat
and watched out of one wise eye while
they speeded down into the valley

  but there were no flocks and as there
were none he could not understand in-
stead he came out into a valley such as he
had never seen full of farms and people
and cur dogs whose reason for being had
always been a puzzle to his aristocratic
understanding two hours later when
they speeded into san jose through the
maze of houses he lifted his muzzle
toward his master the sweet aroma of
the desert was gone there was no scent of
sheep and the tang of salt air had become
an oppression what sort of a place was
this bob arnold patted him on the
head

  you dont understand old fellow do
you but youll get used to it wait till
we see the kiddies

  bob arnolds children were waiting on
the lawn two minutes after his arrival
they had the dog on the grass and were
putting him through his antics with the
neighbors children looking on and the
more blase parents giving him their criti-
cal inspection-critical because as one fat
real-estate broker put it they could not
understand how any man could allow five
thousand dollars to repose in a hunk of
dog-flesh and had the man been able
to read the dogs mind he would have
been far from flattered-because rex had
his own idea of well-dressed fat men

that night rex got his first taste of
a the super-nicety of suburban civiliza-
tion when the family retired he was
carefully bedded in the kitchen where
with the ill-smelling varnish in his nostrils
and the plastered ceiling over his head he
brooded and catnapped through the long
dark hours it was his first night away
from the open places and he could not
understand this choice of a dark cubby-
hole instead of the sweet comfort of the
starlit sky and the smell of sheep never-
theless his dreams brought him solace and
lifted him through the night-dreams of
sheep and jean la jennette wherein he
fcllowed in the rising dust-cloud behind
the flocks with the old basque singing his
iberian lays and pinching his ears while he
poured out the endearment of his caressing
curses

  but morning came at last and with it
a strange bob arnold-pajama clad-to

by austin hall

let him out into the open air outside was
a strange world with houses on either side
trees parked all around and only a small
place left for the open sky the lawn in
front attracted him because it suggested
sheep so he trotted out for inspection
the air was cold and a chill gray fog was
swirling up the street he could not
understand the long line of houses the
hard sidewalks and the stretch of pave-
ment out in front nor could he understand
the people who kept continually coming
out of the houses-they reminded him of
the squirrels he had known in the desert
each with his own private hole out of
which he scooted on his own particular
little business he had always regarded
men as superior creatures beings of un-
told wisdom who knew all things and who
had the choice of the whole world to live
in but these men were different they
were all dressed like the fat man and
they all had the same exaggerated air-
there was not a one who measured up to
the easy grace of his singing sheep-
herders

  one of them walked by and called him
puppy and when out of pure defense
rex showed his teeth he sidestepped
gingerly

  why said the man you vicious
brute i shall speak to mr arnold about
this-or to the pound man such a
nuisance in the neighborhood is not to be
tolerated 

  the mans vocabulary was a little
beyond rexs reach but he understood
the intonation the old dog crouched
down upon the grass to think things over
but his contemplation was again inter-
rupted-this time by a ball of fluff that
rushed out of a neighboring house and
scooted after him across the lawn rex
leaped to his feet the ball was a pom-
eranian lap-dog clean as snow and
decorated by a broad pink ribbon tied
about its neck from its pink little mouth
came the challenge of battle rex was
interested he had seen many dogs curs
and otherwise but never before had he
seen anything like this or was it a dog
when the pomeranian had come quite
close the old fellow made a quick bound
and caught it under his paw the poor
pet went down on its back squirming and
squealing pitifully very deliberately did
the old sheep-dog roll it over and then
when he had determined that it was really
a dog he started to play but his good
old rex retires



intentions were interrupted by a young
lady rushing out of the door

  oh mr arnold she called your
horrid sheep-dog is killing my fifi 

  and at the call bob arnold smoking
his morning pipe came out on the porch

  whats the matter he laughed oh
i see oh he isnt going to hurt fifi he
just wants to examine him what do you
think about him rex some dog eh
mebbe he thinks its a young cat miss
williams

  whereat the young lady stuck up her
nose saucily and bob arnold whistled
rex to a plentiful breakfast on the back
porch

rthat day was destined to live in the old
dogs memory he could not under-
stand such a place and so many people
neither could he understand why with so
much grass there was not so much as a
single sheep when the children were
gone to school he took up his station on
the lawn to think things over and then
he had another adventure

  up the street two horses hitched to a
wagon were coming toward him all that
morning he had seen nary a horse here
at least was something that was worth
looking at on the box were two men
one driving the horses and the other coil-
ing the rope when they were abreast of
the arnold residence they drew up one
of the men spoke

  here he is bill-right where the man
said he would be some dog too better
be easy

  the man on the box alighted and con-
tinued coiling his rope rex was in-
terested here were horses and men
these men were not dressed like the fat
men their common jeans and swinging
gait stamped them as cowboys he was
not afraid then he saw dogs in the
wagon all of them crouching dejectedly
in the corner he was interested and he
ran out then for the first time in his
life he suffered the indignity of the lasso
before he knew it the rope was about his
neck and feet and he was being lifted into
the box so it happened that in less than
twenty-four hours after he had come to
civilization arnolds rex five-thousand-
dollar sheep-dog sire of the most famous
of all utility strains had fallen into the
pandemonium of dog hell but even here
his great beauty and the speaking power
of his tan-brown eyes enabled him to score

the blue

an approximate victory at the pound
the head man singled out the old aristocrat
crouching aloof at the back of the receiv-
ing pen and when he caught the dogs
reproachful eyes he spoke to his helper

   that old fellow back there aint no com-
mon cur you kin tell it by them eyes
look how he scorns the rabble better
take him out put a tag on him for five
dollars if nobody calls we can sel him

two hours later when the irate bob
arnold burst into the pound he found
a humbled and chastened dog chained to
a post upon which was tacked the dis-
graceful legend of five dollars five dol-
lars for rex insult and indignity were
it not for the look on the old dogs face
bob would have burst out laughing but
as it was he stepped up gently and loos-
ened him from the tether what would
old jean la jennette say if he should learn
that a mere pound man had put a price
of five dollars upon the dog of his heart
nevertheless bob received a certain satis-
faction when he told the dog-catchers just
what they had done

  but that was not the end of the adven-
ture bobs wife was the neatest house-
keeper in the san jose willows when
she learned that rex had been in the
pound-which of course must be full of
fleas and vermin-nothing would do but
that the old fellow should have a bath
wherefore rex found himself in a luxuri-
ous bathtub with his eyes full of tar soap
and that was not the worst after a half-
hours scrubbing he had to undergo the
humiliation of a turkish-towel rub-down
and to add still more the children came
home just as he was well dried and in-
sisted on a broad pink ribbon that would
make him look just like fifi which was
just exactly the way that rex did not want
to look the pink ribbon was a disgrace
to his dignity rex may not have had any
great reasoning power but he was pos-
sessed of his own psychology that rib-
bon was the last straw yet all would
have been well had he not run across the
innocent fifi on the front lawn he had
his own notion of where the ribbon idea
had come from the next minute was a
blur with the pretty miss williams pro-
tecting the little pomeranian between her
legs and bob arnold holding rex but
bob understood never again did he allow
them to disgrace rexs royalty with the
badge of pomeranian frippery
book magazine



  the days that followed were not to rexs
liking he was not a city dog and the
arnolds were soon to find it out he had
been reared for a life of action and now
he had nothing to do but play with the
children and loll upon the front lawn he
longed for the sheep and the open desert
and jean la jennette his only solace was
his dreams-dreams of the woolly packs
of the days at the shearing-pens and the
ringing paean of the triumphant basque
and as he dreamed his legs would twitch
to the intensity of his vision then when
he awoke there would be the same monot-
ony of passing automobiles and the unend-
ing procession of fat men how he hated
these well-dressed fat men he became
surly and he began to lose flesh then
one day he suddenly disappeared and was
gone until nightfall the same thing hap-
pened for several days and was not ex-
plained until one day a blue-jeaned italian
knocked at the door of the arnold resi-
dence

  you sella the dog he asked of mrs
arnold you wanta sell i giva one dol-
lar that fina dog

  thus was the mystery explained the
italian had a small place about twelve
blocks distant and was the keeper of half
a dozen milch goats in some way per-
haps through the wind rex had located
them and had proceeded to herd them
much to the delight of the busy italian

  he know the goat just lika the man
he savvy the lady goat that giva the milk
and he savvy the man goat smarta dog
take care of the goat alia day fina dog
for tony galluci i give to you one dol-
lar

  tony did not get the dog when he
was told of rexs real value his hands
went into the air but from that day on
rex became the show wonder of the italian
colony and tony became another jean
la jennette rex had to have sheep or at
least something that approximated thereto
wherefore mrs arnold did not object to
his recreation of a few goats

dut over on the ranch bob arnold was
having his troubles jean la jennette
had become cross-grained and had lost half
his efficiency the insistence of his ques-
tion was ever the same

  ah monsieur wat you do wiz zat tam
dog you kill heem sure zat dog he
want ze sheep and ze good jean la jen-
nette and ze sheep zey go to hell sure

by austin hall

wizout zat tam dog ze good jean la
jennette try but he no can do ah mon-
sieur

  wherewith he would stomp out into the
pens to do what he could but his efforts
were always half-hearted it hurt bob
arnold to see the tears in the old mans
eyes at home he spoke to his wife

  i think that ill have to take the old
dog back old jean simply cant stand it
hes got to have zat tam dog

  and at the sound of the caressing curse
the dog woke out of his slumber he came
over to bob arnold the look in his eyes
was just as appealing as had been the
words of jean la jennette

as it happened however bob arnold
was spared the decision august came
and with it the gentle winds that swept
from the south winds that came down
from the mountains and carried a call that
no sheep-dog could withstand one morn-
ing the old dog left his place on the lawn
and headed for the highway the breeze
was drifting in and his sensitive nostrils
had scented sheep all that day he trotted
along the road dodging automobiles
bound south on his worthy quest nor did
he stop until he had reached the mountains
that form the barrier of the san joaquin
here he dined on a careless rabbit and
lay down in the coolness of a long canon
once again he was in the wild where life
was free and where there was no con-
tamination of fat men the winds blew
down from the top of the mountains and
he scented sheep sheep sheep a thou-
sand generations quivered to that call
beyond the mountains were the flocks and
jean la jennette he dreamed and his
dream was still the same for months he
had dreamed of jean la jennette he could
hear him call and his stub tail fluttered
to the caressing curse of zat tam dog

  when the moon came up and the pine
trees were silhouetted along the ridges he
resumed his journey his old heart
bounded to the joy of freedom here
were the mountains the sounds of his own
world and the scents of the wilderness
all was music-even the yipping of the
coyotes

  but on this night there were more
coyotes than usual by the time he had
reached the summit their calls had be-
come bedlam and he knew what it meant
-sheep some flock was being driven
through the mountains either that or
old rex retires



the blue

the coyotes had stolen the sheep from
far and away and from over the moonlit
ridges came the blood-call and at that
call rex bristled with inherited defiance
it was the way of the wolves to bear down
on the helpless even as it was his own
nature to protect them he stood still
oa of the night he caught the panicky
clatter of a sheep-bell then there were
other sounds muffled and terrible but
clear he could hear the wild heading
in to the kill

  the kill every fiber of his old body
snapped to the call his heart surged to
the wild joy of his hate here was what he
was for-to protect the lowly with his
nose to the ground he took the long slope
heading straight for the scent of the sheep-
pack he had seen sheep stolen before
and he knew how it was done young dogs
who did not know their business let them-
selves be fooled by the cunning coyotes
the coyotes would rush up and lead the
dogs behind them then the outer coy-
otes would sneak in and steal the sheep
jean la jennette never had he and jean
lost a single sheep but he had killed
many a coyote under the light of the moon
that was the most exciting thrill of all-
to throttle the wolves and to feel their
death-gurgle under his teeth

  the flock was packed in a death-trap-
six hundred sheep milling and blatting
under the carnage along the edges raced
the bloodthirsty coyotes tearing down the
sheep with indiscriminate slaughter blood
was riot and the hideous outcry went up
to the watching moon the old dog
rushed in his sharp whoofs mingled
with the death-call no thought of num-
bers no fear a coyote went down-an-
other the old call of the dog pitted
against the wild a thousand generations
fought on rexs side just as a thousand
generations fled before him the sheep
rushed down the canon and the coyotes
took to the hills when he had accounted
for the last coyote rex rounded up the
flock here was the life then he headed
down the canon for the plains and jean
la jennette

jean la jennette was going through
 his morning expostulation

  ah he said misteer superinten-
dente ze monsieur has made wat you call
ze big meestake ze sheep she go to hell
now for sure ze ranch she go to hell
also for why he no bring back zat tam

dog for jean la jennette for one more
centime i throw up ze job and go back
to france mon dieu

  wherewith he thrust his battered tam-
o-shanter on his head and strode out to
the rickety ford that sputtered in the
dooryard charley yerring bob arnolds
ranch superintendent followed with a jug
of wine and a hunk of cheese when it
had been safely deposited beside the keg
of water the old herder slid into his seat

  ah he said by way of adieu you
wait you see zat young portugee he
no savvy the sheep ze young dog she no
understand also non it ees wat ze
american say wat ze hell  

  half an hour later he drove the old ford
across the road that bordered the foothills
it was his duty to supply the herders with
food and water and to superintend the
herding of the various flocks usually he
was very efficient but this morning he
was disgruntled and unhappy his surli-
ness increased when he approached the
white tent and saw no sign of the un-
popular manuel then he beheld that
which made him sit up in self-justified
wrath-a dead sheep one of the dogs
was huddled asleep beside the flap of the
tent there was no sound the other dog
was watching the sheep close by the ex-
perienced basque knew at one look that
something had happened fully eight
hundred sheep were missing that meant
-mon dieu where was manuel

  with a quick step he alighted and thrust
his head into the tent and he needed no
one to tell him what had happened upon
the battered cot huddled among the
crumpled blankets lay the herder eyes
rolling flushed deliriously babbling his
fevered crescendo sick jean la jennette
had seen stricken sheep-herders before
the whole story was there on the cot
the man was helpless and the young dogs
without guidance the coyotes had come
and the sheep had either strayed or been
stolen those were the facts in face of
them the old fellow lost all his resent-
ment very tenderly he stepped over to
the cot threw back the blankets and felt
of the mans face then he picked up
the fevered form and carried it to the ford
and drove gently back to camp

  ah he said when he reached the
ranchhouse wat i say eight hundred
sheep have zis morning gone to ze hell
jean la jennette must now go up to ze
mountain wiz ze young dog no can do
book magazine



by austin hall

monsieur bob he laugh wen jean la jen-
nette say zat he want zat tam dog now
he lose ze five thousand dollar see mon
dieul

mevertheless he hurried at his

	work in no time he had a relief
herder plus two dogs in the machine and
was scurrying across the desert the sun
was high now and as he drove he cursed
the fate that had befallen somewhere up
in the dim blue mountains to the west were
the sheep-and now he must go after them
with the young dogs the monsieur was
to blame ah ze monsieur had made ze
one grand meestake

  as soon as he had deposited the herder
he turned the old ford toward the big
canon that led into the heart of the moun-
tains but the machine was old and
rickety besides jean was perturbed and
overly anxious-so much so that when he
was about a mile from the canons mouth
he killed the engine and just at that mo-
ment a dun-colored pack streaking a
veil of dust came around the bend of the
foothills but jean did not see it neither
did he see the brown-black object that was
running the flock out onto the plain he
was excited and angry the barking of his
young dogs made him more so and per-
haps that was why he forgot his spark
and left it unretarded everything was
going wrong this morning thought jean la
jennette-even the ford now he must
get out and spin the engine mon dieu
ze monsieur he was to blame he took
hold of the crank and stooped his stub
body over to get a purchase when spat-
the crank kicked back and hit him on the
head jean la jennette went down like a
log

  but the pack had come closer the old
dog had spotted the automobile and had
caught the familiar scent while the old
basque was lying unconscious the dog of
his heart was coming in with the sheep
ah zat dog jean did not know but
the old dog was not to be deceived he

smelled blood and he smelled jean la jen-
nette when the sheep were close the dog
left them and came up to the prostrate
body here was his old jean-his man-
thing-his god nowhere in all the world
was there a man-thing like this one and
he was not dead the old dog smelled
of his face and touched him with his paw
then he sat down jean la jennette
here was his master-the lord of his
dreams and the king of his heart it was
good to snuggle up close and to scent the
breath of the loved one the old dog
wagged his tail then he whined softly
and began to lap the face of his master

two days had passed and rex had not
returned to his home in the san jose
willows bob became alarmed and started
a hunt in the italian quarter but tony
galluci had no see-so there was noth-
ing to do but hop in the roadster and head
for the big ranch in the san joaquin but
when he arrived at headquarters there was
no sign of the dog instead he received
the dire news of the missing sheep where-
fore without ado he loaded charley yer-
ring the ranch superintendent into the
car and headed across the desert after
jean la jennette an hour later he found
the flock beside the stalled ford

  jean la jennette was sitting on the
ground with the dog in his lap-a happy
jean crooning an iberian chantey while
the old dog lapped the tears from his
swarthy cheek

  ah monsieur he said see he has
found ze sheep every night jean he
dream and he see zat rex and he say
come and zat dog she wag his tail in
his dream and say yes also but ze
sheep go and zat dog she do not come
but ah monsieur jean la jennette had
forgotten le bon dieu he know an he
tell zat tam dog ou laj out oui an

the ragged moment

      a powerful story laid in a moving-picture studio by the gifted
      author of the crooked knife and mammon misjudges

by william p dudley

i sat with von oppen the movie direc-
tor in the times square office of cameo
pictures inc we were planning the
sets for clara hope benedicts latest pro-
duction the ragged moment para-
graphing our argument came the sudden
purr of von oppens telephone the call
was for me

  colonel douglas speaking william i
heard when i had responded understand
youre starting the old camera next week
on a big prison feature with miss bene-
dict

  i confirmed the colonels information

  listen then william if you want the
inside dope on some real prison stuff ive
got just the bird who can steer you flaw-
lessly hes a chap ive taken a sort of
personal interest in i want to help him
back to the straight and narrow

  whats he done i asked in movie
parlance but the altruistic old stage-
manager misunderstood me

  he tried to make away with fifty thou-
sand in bonds five years ago when he held
a confidential position with julius morgan-

feldt perhaps you remember hes been
up the river for it and recently got paroled
to keep you straight on your prison
technique he ought to prove a cuckoo 

  i conferred with von oppen then turned
again to the telephone

	send him up i invited well look
him over how much money buys him
anything he can live on honestly hes
making a desperate stab to go on the level
if i could get him a job in the movies i
thought he might cash in on his handicap
i made a facetious remark about motion
pictures being the dumping-ground for
most of the freaks and cripples in creation
anyhow one more couldnt make such a
difference

  it was his first indiscretion william
the old colonel pleaded be as broad-
minded as you can as a favor to me and
tell von oppen to clamp on the soft pedal
if the chap doesnt hop around like an ex-
perienced studio man the first ten hours

  i laughed the colonel off the wire and
returned to the sets for the picture and
just after lunch the jailbird appeared
the ragged moment

s

as usually happens in real life he didnt
 look like a jailbird he had no prison
pallor he was neatly and soberly dressed
half a million young men of similiar type
drawing thirty to sixty dollars a week go
to work in manhattan every morning
the only individualistic thing about him
was a hideous scar-a startling scar-
which ran from the corner of his left eye
diagonally down to his jaw subsequently
i learned he had received it while a trusty
in prison he went down permanently
branded before the attack of two escaping
gunmen rather than betray the wardens
confidence by assisting them

  whats your name demanded von
oppen with an aggravating sneer he ap-
praised the ex-convict with the eye of the
hard-boiled director

  archibald j knox returned the fel-
low nervously fumbling his cap

  by the look of your mug id say youd
got the proper moniker-archibald j
knocks is right so you think you can
steer me on my prison atmosphere well
show me

  it was chinese cruelty the way von
oppen said it but that was the directors
idea of humor no man in the business
was more cordially hated by those who
had to work under him as continuity and
estimate man for cameo pictures i was
spared that misfortune

  i dont know that i can show you-in
the abstract knock answered civilly
enough but if youll give me the con-
crete chance in the studio ill try to make
myself valuable

  for how much money

  colonel douglas said i ought to be
worth at least fifty

  well colonel douglas isnt running
my business ill be taking chance enough
having a bird with your record around the
rest of the cast anyhow probably ill have
to pay another man to watch you if you
want to work on props for twenty-five a
week during the life of the picture ill use
you as long as i think youre worth it
the fellow appealed to me in a broken
helpless sort of way and tried to smile

  all right he answered philosophically
von oppen scribbled a message and
handed it to him

  take this over to the cameo studio in
fort grant new jersey give it to bert
masgon the art director hell put you
to work until we know you can qualify as
a prison expert

by william p dudley

  knox took the slip and folded it with
lean fingers that trembled at the door
he paused eyes downcast he spoke

  i know im under a big handicap and
im not bidding for any sob-stuff while put-
ting up a scrap to come back but is it
asking too much-if youll sort of keep
mum about-what ive been-so as not to
prejudice the others too much against me
it wont cost you anything and itll help
me--a lot ill be a thousand times obliged
if you would

  it was the most pathetic request i have
ever heard one man make of another in
thirty-five years of living

  ill think about it parried von oppen
itll all depend on how you behave your-
self and when the door had closed the
director turned to me with a smirk and
winked

  for the love of mike i protested
cant you see the poor fellow is all raw
inside have a heart

  is that my funeral the fellow de-
manded

  that was von oppen all over-selfish
no breeding viewing life from the angle of
a sewer a coward at heart he took a
grim pleasure in bullying the marionettes
with whom he made his pictures-pictures
which kept him in work because he knew
exactly how much salacious material would
get past the censors as a director his
type is passing

i dont know that i ever saw a man try
harder to please an employer than knox
in the weeks which followed a score of
times he kept von oppen from making an
ass of himself among those who knew any-
thing about our modern penal system he
was one step ahead of all the camera shoot-
ing he was the first in the studio in the
morning and the last to leave it at night
he had a natural eye for the artistic in
so far as the term can be applied to the
production of boiler-plate program pictures
and his supply of practical suggestions was
inexhaustible no mechanic on the set
wanted a tool that knox did not produce
instantly no prop was ever misplaced
that knox did not recover from monday
morning until saturday night he stood be-
tween von oppen and a thousand distract-
ing details even better than the assistant
director who drew ten thousand a year
he hadnt been in the studio three days
before von oppen saw his worth and
mentally gave him credit but that was
the ragged moment

j

the only place in which knox got credit-
in von oppens mind in practice the
director used knox as a mat on which to
wipe his feet

  how the victim stood it is beyond me
but he stood it-with a sort of dumb
desperation many times when the direc-
tor was especially cruel i overheard the
electricians remark von must know where
archies got a body buried he mops him
around so

  i think what especially riled von oppen
was the way the jailbird ingratiated him-
self with miss benedict he did it un-
wittingly yet it back-fired on him none
the less harshly he was the only chap
in the studio who consistently called her
miss benedict even behind her back he
always removed his cap when addressing
her no matter how trivial the business
he was uncannily at hand with her mirror
and make-up box when the hot kleigs in-
jured her war-paint at heart he was
a gentleman which von oppen was not

  all that a man could humanly do to live
down a shady past and hold an honest job
young archie did in those weeks which fol-
lowed yet von oppen turned to me one
night and snarled

  ill get that bird one of these days and
ill get him good

  what for i demanded angrily

  he makes too many damned sugges-
tions he goes around here as if he was
as good as the rest of us he forgets what
he is and needs to be showed his place

  i had a hunch that von oppen was be-
ginning to worry because he had annexed
an indispensable who had more of a picture
mind than himself such men are dan-
gerous sometimes they work their own
directors out of jobs

  well i returned stiffly then why
dont you fire him

  none of your damned business grunted
von oppen phlegmatically he turned ab-
ruptly away he wanted to fire the fel-
low but couldnt afford it and archie
couldnt afford to fire himself which ac-
counted for about seven weeks of inhuman
abuse before things came to an adjust-
ment

we had been shooting a ballroom scene
that afternoon word was supposed
to arrive for miss benedict during the peak
of the party that she must hurry to sing
sing where the hero must be saved from
electrocution in the morning as a wealthy

the blue

young society matron miss benedict wore
a pearl necklace that had figured prom-
inently in the films advance publicity
miss benedict had purchased it the pre-
vious season in paris it really cost twen-
ty-five thousand dollars she had to leave
a palatial residence in ballroom attire come
out into a misty street scene and hurry
into a taxicab

  now the effect of mist in the movies is
ecured by stretching taut fly-screening
over the front of the entire set between
the camera and the action in as many
thicknesses as the density of the mist may
require in the preceding shot inside the
ballroom the pearls had been prominently
planted around miss benedicts throat
but just before we shot the mist scene the
clasp that held the string together refused
to stay snapped fearing she might drop
the necklace and injure it the star re-
moved it altogether and pulled her chin-
chilla coat up high to her chin

  mr knox she called can you
come here please

  with a quick jump from the wings
archie was at her side as usual

  please take these up to my dressing-
room and give them to my maid she
requested she dropped the milky gems
in his palm without question then from
behind the false front of the residence
where she had retired she called to von
oppen that she was ready

  it was then that knox finally committed
the unpardonable studio sin in his eager-
ness to get off the set before the camera
started he darted forward without taking
care whither he was headed

  there came a warning cry a wail of de-
spair a shrieking of nails a sickening rip

  tragedy

  knox had darted squarely through the
center of a ninety-dollar screen which had
taken an entire afternoon to train the
lights on properly

  one great ragged rent not only obliter-
ated half a days work it also stopped von
oppen from doing any more shooting until
the following morning

  poor knox it was a human error be-
cause from where he had started in the set
the screen had been almost invisible von
oppen had probably walked through doz-
ens of such screens so had others no
one can count himself a dyed-in-the-wool
movie person until he has walked once
through a mist screen or passed inadver-
tently before the lens while the camera is
book magazine



turning but that availed knox nothing

he had done it and he was-a jailbird

  the fellow picked himself from the floor
and began stammering a chagrined apol-
ogy von oppen leaped forward and his
face was a thing unholy he tore his hair
started cursing

  cursing it was blasphemy of the foul-
est kind he grabbed knox by the shirt-
front

  watching the result scarcely daring to
draw breath were half a dozen electricians
eight or ten carpenters the camera-crew
a score or more of actors and extras-
ranging from the distressed miss benedict
and the rest of the regular cast down to
one frail little street-girl with painted face
red wrists and sleazy stockings who had
been brought into the studio by one of the
assistant directors on the promise that if
she was good to him she might get a
chance to become a second pickford

  all von oppens pent-up animosity of
weeks exploded then in one grand volcano
of bestial temper the word-lashing the
big director administered took no thought
of adjectives expletives metaphors fellow-
feeling or human decency and the ar-
raignment ripping open and exposing all
the mans sordid past scalded like molten
lead on the jailbirds naked flesh

  and now you sniveling hatchet-faced
bond-thief get out of this studio con-
cluded the director and dont you ever
dare set foot in the state of jersey again
for five weeks ive overlooked that you
came here straight from sing sing but
now is the time you walk and believe
me if anyone wants to know anything
about you-a low-lived stock-crook-ill
tell em an earful thatll hound you from
hell to harlem get

  knoxs face was ashen he failed to
move quickly enough so von oppen
pushed him-a vicious backward push
knox tried to catch himself tripped went
over backward against a hot kleig light
and standard went over with a crash of
broken glass before knox could untangle
himself from the cables along the floor fur-
ther enraged by the demolished kleig von
oppen kicked him-and kept on kicking
him until knox rolled over beyond his
reach and somehow regained his feet

  and through the studio permeated the
sickish reek of singed human flesh

  i do not recall that any more shooting
took place the afternoon that archie knox
was canned the electricians set about

by william p dudley

righting the overturned kleig the carpen-
ters substituting another screen but knox
slunk off into the boss carpenters room
in the dark his hat and coat were hung
in there over the washstand was a cab-
inet where medicines might be procured to
assuage the searing pain of the burn up his
arm

  but knox did not get his hat and coat
at once nor did he turn on the lights and
search for the antiseptic he simply moved
across to a rude work-table covered with
blue-prints there he sank in a chair and
buried his scarred face in his good right
arm no one followed him in no one
came near him it was as good as ones
job was worth for von oppen to catch
anyone consoling an employee he had dis-
charged

the time was nearing five-thirty of a
a january afternoon darkness had fal-
len early an arc-lamp shining through
the double windows from a distant street-
corner showed the jail-bird only in silhou-
ette bent over the table and though the
pain in his arm was excruciating it was
not half so unendurable as the pain in his
heart-the pain of realizing that just when
he felt he was making progress toward liv-
ing down the nightmare past he was never
to live it down always there would be
some one to find out and expose him it
was to rise up and mock and wreck him
forever

  jailbird how von oppen had chewed
it crook convict bond-thief re-
gardless of the provocation which had im-
pelled him in a moment of weakness to try
using his employers securities for a pur-
pose of which the world could never know
-it was to be his nemesis there could
be no such thing as living down the past

  the milk of human kindness curdled in
the man during the quarter-hour which fol-
lowed he finally straightened his features
the hue of white paper he straightened
-to find clasped in his hand so tightly
that he had forgotten clara hope bene-
dicts twenty-five thousand-dollar necklace

  he stared dry-eyed at the wealth the
string represented he coiled it down
slowly in the center of a dusty blue-print
before him it was incredible that the
rope of baubles could be worth so much
forty-eight globules as hard as glass as
light as egg-shell as white and pure as con-
gealed polar light

  over in new york-lower new york-
the ragged moment



the blue

knox knew a man who would give him
money for these milky globules a small
fortune of money-and ask no questions
he had worked side by side with one of
the mans henchmen in the factory of the
prison

  the jailbird looked at the coil of gems
fascinated in spite of his mental and phys-
ical suffering evil good-luck had played
into his hand-had given the rope of gems
into his possession just when he needed big
money most there was no one to care
what became of him no sweetheart no
wife no mother he was alone terribly
alone it was his hand played against the
hand of all society why be maudlin
clara hope benedict might not think of
her pearls for hours by nine oclock he
could have the trick turned and be aboard
one of those fruit-steamers for south amer-
ica the way was open nothing hin-
dered

  true he could never return to america
to new york but why should he ever
want to return to new york what had
new york ever done for him except ask for
references he couldnt give reward incen-
tive and honesty and resolute purpose with
a wink and a sneer and a thrashing

  some one finally came down the outer
corridor

  knox pocketed the pearls with a sweep
leaped for hat and coat slipped tempo-
rarily through a side door into an adjacent
storeroom

ttie soft pummeling of a limousine en-

	gine sounded below outside voices-
the soft slam of a door knox looked out
a narrow slit behind some scenery piled
against the window miss benedict was
quitting the place for the day

  other people of the organization left the
building while knox hid there his right
hand gripping the globules of wealth in his
pocket the boss carpenter came into the
room adjoining discussing knox the acci-
dent the exposure with a joke and a re-
gret

  it does beat hell how a guy can put one
over he heard the carpenter declare above
the swash of a faucet he was the last
gink on earth youd take for a jailbird
now wasnt he

  the hiding mans face burned for the
first time in weeks he ground his teeth in
impotent rage at the injustice with which
they accepted von oppens estimate of
him it was as much the comment of the

carpenters as it had been von oppens ar-
raignment which crystallized knoxs deter-
mination to throw maudlin scruple over-
board to look out for himself and his fu-
ture while the devil gave him his chance
the carpenters got into their coats picked
up pails in which empty dishes tinkled
went out

  after a time when he assumed the way
was clear knox slipped from his hiding-
place

  a drop-light was burning down the
empty corridor he paced swiftly for the
door at the end on the balls of his feet
he was about to open it slip out cut
across the south lot board a car over on a
back-street that would carry him to the
forty-second street ferry when-his heart
somersaulted in the shadows beside the
door he saw a girl was standing 

  knox did not know the girl yet he real-
ized new york was filled with types like
her-little thin painted faces shabby-
genteel apparel that was sleazy to the point
of pathos red wrists holes in the heels of
their artificial silk stockings where they
came from how they lived why there were
so many what became of them god alone
knew

  the jailbird halted abruptly conscience
admitted he was a felon already he hesi-
tated he might not have recognized the
girl but she recognized him there came
an awkward pause the girl surveyed him
spoke first--impulsively

  oh youre the feller that big brute
pushed into the light somebody said you
got burned you oughta have him ar-
rested

  there was something about her of back
alleys and lean living of life that was hard
and experience caustic there was some-
thing about her also of that indomitable
tenacity of those who live-somehow-on
lifes outskirts and retain always a desper-
ate resentment against those in power who
use that power to hurt the ill-favored-
who admit there is justice to be had if one
would only fight back with enough spirit
but more than these there was something
about her too perhaps the lilt of her
voice the challenge of her words that ex-
pressed just feminine sympathy and in
that instant young archie needed it sorely

  a fat chance id have to get him ar-
rested and knox laughed it was not
a pretty laugh it was bitter there was
something diabolical about it

  why not he beat you up didnt he
book magazine



and he kicked you while you was down
but he was right about me being a
jailbird i havent got a chance

  what if you was you can be proud
of that cant you-stead of bein ashamed
and lettin a big stiff like him boot and
knock you all over the place

  proud of it yeah oh sure im
proud of it im so proud of it i could
climb on top of the studio right this min-
ute and shout it all over the state

  but you served your time didnt you
you didnt break jail or nothin

  no i didnt break jail i even got
paroled for good behavior

  then what the hell its somethin to
be proud of aint it i heard an old sal-
vation army gink say so to a bum one
night if you done wrong and was sent
up says he but served your time like a
man youre square with the world and
have paid your bill he says the ones
to be ashamed is them that is still uncaught
-who know theyve did wrong and wont
pay up-honestly a spell up the river is al-
ways set as long as the wrong you done was
worth and when its over youre square
when a gink looks at you and says
youre a dam jailbird hold up your
head real ritzy and say back yeah

i paid my debt like honest john have
you paid yours ive always remembered
that i got a couple o gentleman friends
up the river right now squaring their-
selves

  squaring themselves

  knox dropped his eyes his emotions
were chaotic he had never thought of it
so before always he had felt that instead
of squaring himself with society by suffer-
ing his incarceration he had been the
hapless victim of societys retribution

  the girl must have understood the
abrupt conflict that was boiling in his
heart she put out a hand and laid it on
his arm ethics were swept by the board
as she said simply

   dont let it get yer goat kiddo i
know its a raw deal but dont let it get
yer goat i feel sorry for you honest i
do i know it dont mean much whether
im sorry or not but i seen him baste
you and im sorry because you was down
but play the game kiddo youre square
with the world now if you done your time
stay square and dont let the big stiff get
away with it

  it was all that she could express she
was no hand at making soft speeches she

by william p dudley

lived her life in the raw-cheaply she
simply spoke what she felt and her sin-
cerity rang in her voice knox felt her
skinny little fingers press his arm then
she left him went out into the cold of the
night

  he never set eyes on her again

lnox backed against the corridor wall

   unconsciously from his pocket he
pulled miss benedicts pearls he held up
the string coiled it down slowly in his
palm but his eyes did not see it wholly
he was looking instead through a great
rent in the veil of life seeing things sud-
denly at a terrific revaluation

  there is such a ragged moment in the
life of every man when he may go up or go
down-it is for him to choose those who
choose to go up may see before them
steeps and thunder-heads tortuous wind-
ings jagged ledges clawing brambles dizzy
precipices but on the heights the road
smooths out and a glorious light shines
everywhere

  but for those who choose to go down-
below is only a morass of abandon lost
self-respect mental and moral chaos

  knox groaned in that moment of geth-
semane while he debated

  there was still ample time to get out
with the pearls to realize a small fortune
on them to be aboard a south american
steamer before midnight but the moment
he passed this studio door and emerged
with them in his possession he had delib-
erately elected to give up the fight to sur-
render to turn his steps downward to
blackness he had elected to renig on old
colonel douglas who had trusted him and
found him a job on warden bates who
had been responsible for his parole on
every person in the studio who had treated
him decently taken him at his face value
believed in him to turn up missing with
the morning was fulfillment that he was all
von oppen had expected of him and
charged him with being he was the jail-
bird indeed running true to type

  knox suddenly ran his fingers up across
his forehead into his hair displacing his
cap it was as though he swept some-
thing away from his eyes the next in-
stant everything came clear he whirled
and strode back down the studio

i ie strode back down the studio taking
i off his overcoat as he went he passed
through the entire length of the corridor
the ragged moment



out into the big atelier again where von
oppen was angrily superintending the lo-
cation of new lights against the fresh screen
the carpenters had erected knox walked
up to him

  ive got some business to settle with
you you big stiff he announced

  von oppens face paled but only
for an instant a leer marked his beefy
features

  i told you to get out he snarled im
done with you

  but im not done with you take off
your coat

  take off my coat what the-

  take off your coat im giving you a
better chance than you gave me you
kicked me while i was down

  ill take off nothing

  all right i warned you have it as
you please im here to give you the beat-
ing up of your life before i quit youve
had it coming for a long time

  you beat me up you go to-

  he didnt finish knox crouched and
whipped a blow squarely into the center of
von oppens hate-flushed face the man
spun around and grabbed a studio girder
he shook himself to get his reeling senses
spitting out a tooth with a roar of rage he
rushed upon knox then-and the jailbird
settled grimly to the business of giving von
oppen the most terrific whipping that had
ever taken place on the property of cameo
pictures before the camera or otherwise

  workmen who had remained and extras
came running back into the atelier elec-
tricians appeared over the tops of sets
wood-tumers came running from the lathe-
room scene-painters dropped overcoats
and empty dinner-pails actors ran half-
clad from the dressing-rooms from van-
tage-points of safety they watched that
struggle-a shouting hooting whistling
applauding audience and not one of them
attempted to interfere

  knox drove the larger man back into a
bank of cooper-hewitts and the glass of
the tubes slashed his scalp then he
knocked him against a great wall of compo
that went down in a shower of debris and
dust von oppen fought free grasped and
hurled a property statuette it would have
brained the lad but he dodged cleverly
the deadly thing shot through the window
of a fifth avenue drawing-room into an
east indian rajahs palace bringing up
finally on the floor of a small-town grocery
store next door to a london opium-joint

the blue

kleig-lights went over furniture flat-
tened a second mist-screen was ripped to
rags von oppen caromed through it
twice

  there is something eminently fine and
fair about an american crowd they like
to see the under dog get the best of it
and the measure with which this crowd
coached on the bantam was the measure of
their hatred for von oppen as well he
was getting the thrashing all of them would
have liked to administer had they dared

  roaring like a bull again and again the
director charged he had his prestige to
maintain his pride to uphold likewise
he had his big soft body to keep from the
hospital he saw red a dozen times his
eyes were awash with it but he could not
get the wiry young man to stay in one
place and receive his punishment

  all over the lighted portion of the studio
the younger man drove him knoxs elbows
close to his body torso bending only at the
hips head back legs firmly planted with
short quick powerful jabs with hooks and
uppercuts he hammered his opponent
von oppen shouted to his employees for
assistance but the only thing that re-
sponded was a final right hook to the chin
it assisted von oppen all the way down
to the floor he stayed there quivered a
moment then rolled over on his face

pandemonium broke the specta-

	tors hooted whistled stamped on the
floor but knox turned away not showing
that he heard he ran his fingers through
his rumpled hair picked up his cap hooked
together his right shirt-sleeve where the
stud had become unfastened swung into
his overcoat

  he never glanced at the battered figure
on the floor he buttoned his coat and
walked from the studio the pearls were
still in his left pocket

  he went out into the alley and down
to the corner of the street twenty min-
utes later he was crossing the north river
on the ferry for new york

  but instead of heading for lower man-
hattan he headed for morningside he
alighted from a bus before a palatial apart-
ment near grants tomb miss benedicts
maid admitted him when he rang the bell
on the fifth floor

  the actress had barely finished dressing
for dinner when archie knox was shown
into a reception room she entered with
puzzled frown
book magazine



by william p dudley

  i came to return your pearls miss ben-
edict he apologized you remember you
gave them to me tonight just before i
stepped through the mist screen you left
the studio before i could deliver them to
your maid in your dressing-room

lie produced the beautiful string of gems

  	that glowed resplendent in the shaded
lighting the womans face cleared in
a voice a bit relieved she declared

  you neednt have brought them up here
tonight it would have been all right to
have given them back at the studio in the
morning

  but im not going back to the studio in
the morning neither will von oppen i
pounded the stuffings out of him half an
hour ago for calling me a jailbird

  clara hope benedict raised her million-
dollar eyebrows

  are you a jailbird or are you not

  i have been a jailbird but ive come
to feel that ive paid in full for what ive
done-that im not a jailbird now
youve been a thief and a convict and
yet you brought back my necklace with-
out attempting to dispose of it why
because i consider ive squared myself
with society by serving the sentence that
was handed me-and i wouldnt let a fel-
low like von oppen whip me into believ-
ing i hadnt

  whats that got to do with returning
my necklace

  if ive squared my debt im as good
as any other man i wouldnt steal your
pearls any more than anybody else i
brought them up here so that if anything
happened to me before morning i couldnt
be accused of doing something i hadnt the
least intention of doing

  thank you knox if you beat up von
oppen i consider you were justified but
that means youve lost your job now
what will you do

  im going to south america on a fruit
steamer before twelve oclock

  he said it so positively that clara hope
benedict was startled then she eyed him
narrowly a moment later she spoke
youre not going to do anything of the
sort youre going back to the cameo as
assistant under a new director mr
moriss the president knows everything
hes in the next room im going to dinner
with him in a few minutes von oppen
gets his years salary and his contract torn
up in the morning i choose to work with
gentlemen mr knox never mind what
youve done mistakenly in the past i con-
sider that youre one of the best now

hphere are people who from time to
time have said harsh things about
cameos leading woman they have called
her mercenary hard-boiled calloused blase
inflated in her own conceit a typical mov-
ing-picture actress from the crown of her
henna coiffure to the tips of her satin
pumps i have often wondered if they
like lots of us in similiar cases have not
missed the real clara hope benedict

  archibald j knox got out of her apart-
ment somehow down the five floors to the
street out upon riverside drive there
were tears upon his scarred face and a
lump in his throat that he could not down
but in his heart was singing-an anthem

  to my humble way of thinking how-
ever the finest part of the episode remains
to be told

  not to this day has she ever let her
high-salaried assistant director know that
if he had elected to cut and run with her
pearls that night he would have sold his
soul and his future and the faith that
others had in him for a mess of rubbish
she never risked her twenty-five-thousand-
dollar string to the perils of studio work
the necklace knox returned so faithfully
was a synthetic replica worth about

what has already happened

papua is still a sinister wilderness
informed with the spirit of evil
and pretty stacy rowan newcome
on the morinda sensed this clearly as
many a bride has asked before she asked
herself with dismay how ever am i to
live here

  the answer proved even more difficult
than she imagined because she was get-
ting on-she was twenty-six-and the
right man had not appeared and because
she had met charley holliday at a time
and place when he showed to best ad-
vantage she had agreed to marry him
and next day she carried out the bargain
and went with him to live on the lonely
island of siai where he was stationed
but stacy soon realized that she had made
a mistake and soon all the island world
knew it for holliday was discharged from
his post for smuggling poached bird-of-
paradise plumes and there had been an
affair with a native woman

  one rainsforth was sent to take holli-
days place and traveling with him came
mark plummer a lean and competent
sailor of fortune in the south seas who
felt perhaps more than pity for stacy hol-
liday and whom she trusted instinctively
and presently it came about that the hol-
lidays gladly accepted plummers offer to

join an expedition to the island of oro
to which he had acquired title and on which
a quantity of poached pearl-shell was be-
lieved to be cached

  there were five white people in the
party that landed on this island plummer
who owned it the hollidays who fur-
nished the food-stores they had had at siai
tom blazes or tombazis a swash-
buckling irish-greek shipmaster who pro-
vided the schooner and nydia leven an
australian girl-friend of stacys who had
contributed needed moneys

  the first night on the supposed unin-
habited island an unknown prowler cut
through the wall of stacys hut-touched
her hand next night plummer shifted the
mens quarters with the womens and a
stealthy attempt of raiding malays to carry
off the women was defeated they left
one dead man behind them-and holliday
suffering from a serious kriss-stab when
next day a british cruiser passed they
signaled her with a rocket and a surgeon
was landed the physician ordered holli-
day taken aboard the ship for an operation
was necessary and as the vessel could not
delay it steamed away with holliday in the
sick-bay and those remaining on the island
uncertain whether he would live or die

tombazis had fallen in love with nydia

chapter xiv

when tombazis and nydia arrived at
 thursday island there was no news at
all for them

  they sighted the bright red roofs and
bright green hills of t i early in the
forenoon of the third day tombazis took
the kikenni boldly in through the reefs
that have picked the bones of so many
brave ships in their time and brought up
in the anchorage waiting for pratique he
had to wait some while thursday is above
all others the island of no hurry and it
does not in any case think very much of
the needs and wishes of little auxiliary
schooners great japanese and chinese
liners with crazy names big dutch boats
that are the last word in luxury and com-
fort australian steamers manned by

mutinous crews borneo boats singapore
boats philippine boats and more run
through t i as through a clapham
junction of the seas squatted on the tip of
australia thursday island-which once
was and now is not a little queen of the
seas-peers out through bleary aging eyes at
the proud steamers as they trample by
chews over and over the cud of long past
glories drink- and opium-sodden strangely
perfumed with the hot reek of sandalwood
she sits there soaking in the torrid suns
her hideous iron houses hideously ruined
her grassy streets given over to the true
inhabitants and rulers of the island-
goats nothing is active in thursday but
the goats no one is civilized but the savage
blacks the steamers call in drop and
take up pilots drink a little water and
hurry on again thursday is they seem to
think an excellent place to go away from

  nydia during the last two days of her
forced trip had had time to make up her
mind and lay her plan of campaign and
when the kikenni cast anchor in quaran-
tine and began to blow trumpet-shells for
a doctor she knew just what she was and
was not going to do there was no use
making a fuss about the fact that she was
an unwilling passenger to t i the less
said about that the better-with a view
to the preservation of the highest possible

market value of her spotless character
after all in the island world plenty of
women-even young lovely women like
herself-had to make passages alone in
ships captained by queer characters if
she held her tongue nobody would see any-
thing astonishing about the trip she could
trust tombazis to hold his

dy and by the doctors launch came out
and the doctor of the year-a fat
elderly person with an ingrained hatred of
ships-reluctantly permitted them to come
alongside the wharf nydia had made the
best of herself by dint of starch and irons
commandeered aboard and a gay green
sash of tombazis eagerly presented her
by that infatuated sailor thursday island
she knew was inhabited by something very
like white savages but she meant to look
her best before them nydia would have
wanted to look her best if one had been
leading her out to instant execution or
drowning her with her heels and thumbs

tied like a witch of old

  blazes once alongside lost a little of
his conquering demeanor but nevertheless
he was determined to make the best of the
situation even as nydia from her point
of view was determined

  well my lovely lady he accosted her
as the ktkenni sidled nearer and nearer in
to the wharf how soon can you be ready
to come up to the parsons with me
nydia smiled her sweetest smile she
had no intention of making any such visit
but she thought it was safest-on this tiny
island-to temporize with the impulsive
blazes until such time as she should be able
to find out the fate of charley holliday
she did not disguise from herself that his
death if unhappily it had occurred would
make a difference and if events ever
drove her to think of marrying blazes why
two shares in the treasure of oro island
if it existed-and shrewd nydia thought
it did-would certainly be better than one
in return for her precious hundred pounds
perhaps if she played her hand skillfully
she might get tombazis share out of him
without the necessity of marrying him in
return hed do anything for me she
thought complacently and after all im
not in his power now

  in which as she was to find later she
had reckoned without her tombazis

  i dont know about parsons was her
answer to his question ill have to think
a little about that and anyhow i must
get some clothes do you realize you

the blue

dreadful man that i havent a rag to
wear

  theres some quite decent shops here
if you can wake them up enough to attend
to you answered blazes never been
here before have you

  he cocked an eye at her as if the answer
were of some importance

  no never she answered carelessly
and by the look of it i dont much care
if i never see it again

  come on and well put the dredge
through their dear delightful shops of-
fered blazes amiably name anything in
the town and its yours my treat

  i can go to the bank thanks replied
nydia proudly

tombazis threw her a queer look and

	then glanced slyly at one of his crew a
cunning hanuabada boy who was trotting
down the length of the wharf apparently
bent on some kind of business nydia oc-
cupied with the awkward tilted gangway
did not notice

  once landed on the wharf among the
thursday island crowd of idlers-japs
chinese malays black queensland aborig-
inals europeans with queer pole-jawed
faces and skins of fish-belly white-she
drew herself up patted her hair and set off
along the tramline between squared piles
of deliciously smelling sandalwood to the
town blazes without by-your-leave or
with-your-leave accompanied her

  you know said nydia coldly pausing
to look up at his lumbering height from
underneath her parasol that ive only to
appeal to the resident or the police to be
free of you at once

  yes darling lady but i know you
wont replied the big man calmly be-
cause they would tell tales all over thurs-
day island-and that means all over the
coast of australia-about the lovely young
woman who was run away with by that
villain tombazis and i havent quite the
best character in the islands dear lady-
though they arent particular in the
islands no i dont think youll tell
nydia was furious with him for having
so correctly read her thoughts

  well i can tell you she snapped
that resident or none i mean to take the
first boat that goes south to sydney from
here

  yes said blazes smiling a little and
busying himself with the lighting up of one
of his big cigars come in and buy some
pretties first
book magazine



  they entered a gloomy unpromising
looking den guarded by a sort of dirty
human spider more or less white who-
reluctantly it seemed-began at tombazis
order to unpack and unroll wonders in the
way of silken and gauze blouses kimonos
skirt-lengths nydia was ravished this
sort of oriental luxury was exactly what
appealed to her it was always with an
unwilling hand that she spent money on
the simple tailor-mades and linens that she
knew to be good form in sydney

  she chose underthings she chose silks
satins gauzes and gave orders to have the
bundle sent to the ship

  theyll be paid for on delivery she
said or perhaps you might send them
to the hotel i shall be going ashore

  tombazis who had been waiting with
an odd gleam of amusement in his eyes
remarked youd like to take your room
perhaps

 yes i should answered nydia
promptly she left tombazis and made
her way to a gorgeous gingerbready build-
ing nearly all artificial front where a
supercilious tired woman in a silk dress
patent-leather shoes with holes in them
and bare legs received her with a silent
stare

  i want a room for the night began
nydia

  gentleman too

  no im by myself

  wheres your luggage

  unfortunately it was left behind al-
lowed nydia growing uncomfortable be-
neath the stare of the gorgeous slattern

  pay in advance then

  of course said nydia putting on
her duchess air which called forth an un-
ashamed giggle from the barelegged lady
im just going down to the bank she
walked out of the hotel scarlet with an-
noyance there was a branch of the new
victorian banking company in thursday
island-her bankers they would attend
to her

ten minutes later she was leaving the
bank building amazement and terror in
her heart the bank did not know her
and refused to cash checks for an unknown
young woman

  you can radio to svdnev nydia said
loftily

  i cant identify you by radio madam
replied the clerk did you come in by
the schooner this morning captain tom-
bazis boat yes well we would take

by beatrice grimshaw

his identification no doubt he will give it
no doubt replied nydia with the
overdone certainty that in banks does not
carry conviction she went down the steps
raging she now saw what the wily
greek-irishman had seen long ago-that a
strange young woman in a strange town
must usually depend upon her friends for
money and where were her friends

  she did not know that the clerk might
have bestirred himself a little more in her
interest-might even have wired to syd-
ney where his firm had many dealings with
the leven family and their relatives if he
had not an hour earlier received a brief
line from tombazis reading

    lady passenger on my boat from port
  moresby claims to be miss nydia leven of
  sydney cannot identify

  another of em was his brief com-
ment as he dropped off again into the long
daydream that envelops thursday island
and its strangely unoccupied inhabitants
there had not been a caller at the bank of
new victoria for three days previous to
nydias visit the last caller had been a
remittance-man with red eyes who wanted
to cash a check torn from some one elses
book for a sum that neither he nor the
possessor of the check-book had ever
owned in their respective lives

  up the endless tumbledown street full
of grass and goats nydia leven walked
quickly her hands tight-gripped on her
parasol what to do next she could
have telegraphed asking for an immediate
remittance by wire to her bankers in syd-
ney or to the married sister with whom
she lived when at home had she had the
necessary shillings it would take four or
five she calculated at t i one has to
use the radio to get the mainland and then
send on by land line it might as well
have been four or five pounds-or four or
five hundred when one has no money
one has neither pounds nor shillings nydia
had never struck her head against this
elementary fact before she found it bruis-
ing

  pawnshops she had a ring or two a
bracelet thefe was no sign of any such

place one might askshe turned

into a shop a strange mixed sort of place
displaying odd sets of china of the pat-
terns that no one buys ironmongery dirty
tables where it was conceivable tea
might disgustingly be served there was
no one in the place she stamped and
the sands of oro



knocked a small malevolent eye sur-
veyed her through a hole in a door curtain
-and went away again nydia waited
absolutely without result

vvhat a damned place she said to
 herself and went out to the goats and
the grass and the sun again a chinaman
loafing along in blue tom jeans and straw
slippers paused at her imperious here

  is there a-a shop where they buy things
here she asked him finding the words
come hard the chinaman looked at her
with glittering black-glass eyes she was
certain somehow that he understood her
but he replied in an unknown tongue
hunched his shoulders and went on nydia
said damn to herself again

  i wish i knew some worse words she
said to herself now i know why men
swear it would do one good if one knew
how damn blast

  a dried-up leather-colored white woman
dressed in the fashions of  emerged
from an alleyway looked at her hard and
scuttled away glancing back over her lean
shoulder

  this isnt real its a bad dream said
nydia to herself slapping her parasol at a
tall black goat with devils eyes that stood
in the middle of the sidewalk and declined
to move she had to walk round him

  the goat or the  woman she did
not know which drove her to desperation
she stopped the next person she met a
slack half-asleep-looking blue-aproned
butcher with a leg of mutton trailing from
one hand and a piece of steak hugged
under his arm he seemed in some mys-
terious way to have lost his shop

  wheres there a pawnbrokers she
plumped out i want to sell something
nowhere said the butcher staring
fishily nydia knew he was lying she
was certain by this time that everybody
in t i lied by habit and preference

  what do you want to sell he asked
her cunningly no one thought nydia
madly should be a butcher who looks so
much like a fish

  a bracelet she answered

  what about a kiss said the fish-faced
butcher

  oh god said nydia and turned
down an alleyway at the end of which to
put the cap on the climax she ran unex-
pectedly into tombazis the captain
very big very white-and-gold was loung-
ing on a broken little bridge that led to

the blue

nowhere his demeanor was so carefully
absent-minded that nydia felt sure he had
been following her the whole morning

   my lady said blazes sweeping off his
cap this is a pleasure i didnt expect
come with me and ill show you a chinese
place where there is tea that is-ah he
sighed and cakes you never dreamed
of course he knew that the eleven oclock
tea of the island world was due and that
nydia wanted hers she gave in tired
out and followed blazes

they came to a queer sandalwood-
smelling little place behind a collection
of laundries and cake-shops hideously in-
termixed it was cool after the furious
sun of the street the chinaman was swift
and polite the food carried out tombazis
promises nydias greediness was one of
her weak spots in this as in other small
vices she and tombazis were one stacy
would not have made friends with a man
who had violently abducted her for the
sake of a dainty meal-nor for the sake
of a crust to keep her from starvation
mark plummer who contentedly fed on
tin and biscuit for months when nothing
else was to be had would have liked nydia
even less than he did if he could have seen
her in the chinamans green-shaded shop
daintily quickly nibbling into cake after
cake crunching one new delicious sweet-
meat after another an expression of per-
fect happiness gradually overspreading her
face-for indeed ah sing was a master of
his craft but tombazis understood

  you will be fat begosh you will my
lady after forty he thought handing her
another dish of cream-cakes but i like
them fat

  unthinkingly he said the last words
aloud

what do you like fat asked nydia
cream-cakes answered tombazis with
a languishing look that carried his meaning
home nydia was not in these lazy days
growing slimmer

   she bethought her bursting a cake skill-
fully that blazes was a very comfortable
companion if there had been no mark
plummer in the world-

  over the shoulder of tombazis above
his thick red features rose like a mirage
the lean bronze-pale crusader-face of
mark and nydias heart leaped within
her so that she let loose the short sharp
sighing breath all lovers know her love
for mark plummer was the strongest the
book magazine

least selfish thing in her weak and selfish
nature it was to her -credit that she saw
his fineness of soul as well as the clean
strong beauty of feature that had first at-
tracted her there was no particular fine-
ness in tombazis soul between her and
him the attraction was surely that of like
to like for all her superficial advantages
of birth and education tombazis was on
her level and mark was above it if she
did not actually know these things she felt
them the months she had passed in papua
-that strange land where class for class
the best is like the worst had taught
her something

  if they had all met together in sydney
she would instinctively have set down the
weak and vicious holliday as unquestion-
ably superior to all stacy next-because
stacy too came of good people herself
of course not below stacy-she couldnt
quite have said why then mark who cer-
tainly had manners but didnt display them
in the only proper place society last tom-
bazis because he was a small merchant
captain and so far as one knew not rich

  as it was things-to her view-had got
hopelessly and absurdly mixed but she
wasnt going to marry tombazis certainly
not-if ever-while hollidays fate re-
mained doubtful for if he were dead
would not stacy marry mark plummer
just as quickly as she could catch him

co nydia to herself and tombazis who

  followed her thoughts pretty accurately
watched her pulled his huge mustache and
told himself that events were going quite
as well as he could expect

  he had had a brief word aside with the
chinaman as he entered ah sing had
shaken his head and bowed hands ex-
tended he was thinking of this when he
suggested to nydia by and by that she
should ring up the hospital and find out if
holliday was there it sounded magnani-
mous and cost him nothing

  of course i will said nydia rising
and shaking out her silks and laces im
sure well hear he was put in there all
right wheres the number

  but the hospital had never heard of hol-
liday had not had any such accident case
brought in

  the resident furthermore when rung
up assured her that the aulis had not
called at thursday island-was not so far
as the official knew even in that part of
the world

by beatrice grimshaw



  nydia turned a little pale she had
been relying more than she knew on meet-
ing with holliday she could have bor-
rowed money from him got him to help
her somehow for she was beginning to
realize that she needed help she imagined
-and correctly-that it was not the first
time blazes had run off with a girl though
she was reasonably sure that no girl
previously had been treated with so much
consideration as she had by that under-
study of bully hayes

  but now-

  no money no friends no way of getting
out of blazes reach except by creating a
scandal about herself from which she still
shrank how could any girl expect to
make a good match-even a love-match
which wasnt generally a good one-if she
posted herself all over the pacific as the
girl that blazes had abducted in his boat

  of course if she absolutely had to she
would throw herself on the mercy of some
respectable resident no doubt there were
such to be found if one looked long enough
and hard enough she would not in any
case go back with blazes but things were
black enough as it was any way one
looked at it

  her face was clouded as she drew on
her gloves and walked out leaving tom-
bazis to pay with her native shrewdness
about money matters she realized now
that he had concealed the truth when he
represented himself to plummer as penni-
less and obtained a share in the expedi-
tion for the use of his boat she guessed
that he had resources of his own some-
where or other it made her think more
of him but also fear him more

  tombazis let her get ahead and then
followed at some distance she knew he
was there and it irked her she could not
think what to do next and she knew he
knew it every time she stopped to look
into a shop window-there was nothing in
any of the windows to look at but pearl-
shells and inferior groceries-she saw him
about the same distance behind a dazzle
of white and gold under the green of the
trees that shaded the footpath-strolling
smoking completely at his ease silently
amusedly watching her

jsjydia at last began to lose a little of

	her nerve she felt she had under-
estimated tombazis what on earth was
one to do she found herself at the com-
mencement of the jetty again a boy from
the sands of oro



the silk-shop was walking back to the town

  have you been down to the kikenni 
asked nydia

  the boy a yellow-brown mixed-breed
creature with stupid eyes nodded

  did you bring my things

  he looked over his shoulder shouted
yes and ran away

  nydia cast a quick glance behind tom-
bazis was nowhere to be seen

  in a moment she had made her plans
she must secure her things-the thought
of deserting that bundle of splendors was
unendurable but she would not stop a mo-
ment longer on the ship than was necessary
she would bundle up the goods carry
them away herself-what did it matter
here where no one knew who she was-
and find some one on the island to take her
in if there was going to be a scandal
well then there was going to be some-
thing had to be done she was getting
frightened she hoped blazes wouldnt
meet her but if he did he could not stop
her in public and for the moment he
was certainly not to be seen

  she scurried down the wharf looking
right and left nothing but the blue flame
of the water the white flame of the sky
the little pearling-luggers with thin pen-
ciled masts riding at anchor a boat or
two drifting lazily seaward  she was safe
enough a little laugh bubbled up to her
lips at the thought of that bundle of ori-
ental splendors for which tombazis must
undoubtedly have paid or they would not
have been delivered it was a good joke
against him well serve him right it was
only one small item of repayment in the
long account he owed her

  the kikenni lay against the wharf
white-decked green-painted neat and clean
blazes was a good sailor his ship never
went short of anything necessary to her
looks

  missus you wantem something asked
a tallish trousered kiwai whom she recog-
nized as the uncivil engineer

  one boy he bring parcel belong me
asked nydia looking about her it was
quiet and peaceful on the kikenni a boy
or two lay sleeping upon the hatch the
shadows of the naked varnished masts
swung lazily back and forth across the
deck marking its sanded white with blue
out in the anchorage the pearling-luggers
colored jade and ivory rolled to the power-
ful thursday island tides they seemed
deserted unpeopled the red-roofed ruin-

the blue

ous town dozed at the end of the long jetty
beneath a white hot sun there was a
persistent scent of sandalwood sun-warmed
and very sweet underneath as it were
flowed another and less pleasant odor that
of rotting shell

  you look very pretty said nydia to
the town but i dont think im going to
enjoy myself very much staying here
wherein as people sometimes do she spoke
truths as yet unknown to her

  the kiwai who had been staring at her
rather unpleasantly said something quick
in native to another papuan

  oibe it is so answered the other

  altogether somethings belong you said
the engineer to nydia stop along you
cabin

  bring them up ordered nydia

  you go get em was the kiwais in-
solent answer he turned swaggeringly
away and spat a quid of betel-nut blood-
red into the green of the sea

  by-an-by promised nydia sharply
i tellem you boss altogether knockem off
head belong you my boy

  all right said the kiwai watching
her out of the tail of his savage eye he also
watched the sea something he saw there
caused him to speak again to the other
papuan the two stood waiting nydia
supposed for her to go down and get her
things

che swallowed her anger knowing as
 she did that the western papuan is
always inclined to be insolent to women
and resentful of taking orders from them
when no white man is about anyhow she
had no time to waste it was just luck that
tombazis had not followed her to the jetty
she could not help wondering a little but
her own eyes informed her that no such
tall stout figure as the captains was vis-
ible anywhere along the whole quarter-mile
of wharfing even if he were hidden
among some of the piles of sandalwood at
the far end-a thing not very likely-still
she would have ample time to go down
into the cabin get her finery and reach
the wharf again long before tombazis
could cover half the distance

  there was not a sound as she went down
the companion but the regular sharp slap
of the incoming tide against the kikennis
counter and the dull snoring of the boy
asleep on the main hatch the confined
smell of paint and carpeting kerosene and
stored apples struck her with a suggestion
book magazine

of discomfort almost fear it made her
feel shut up but there was no possibility
of that again

  here were the silks a large and heavy
bundle put away on one of the lockers
she did not mind carrying it at least as far
as the wharf one could probably find an
aboriginal to help one with it up town-
whither well that had still to be found
out but one thing was certain she wasnt
going back or anywhere in the kikenni

  musing thus she twisted the string
tightly round the big parcel with the view
of compressing it as much as possible tried
its weight and tucked it under her arm
she was standing with her back to the
hatchway through which most of the light
in the little cabin fell she had not taken
more than a minute over the parcel there
was no sound behind her but-suddenly
the light in the cabin lessened nydia
dropped the parcel and flung round quick
as she was she was too late some one
had come up without sound and slid the
doors shut

  an unexplained instinct made her glance
sharply up at the coop-shaped skylight
one leaf was open through it there
looked a wide red face decorated with a
cigar and a grin

  you ought said the owner of the face
to have come down alongside the wharf
with me in the boat it was much cooler
my lady

  let me out said nydia breathing
sharply

  why darling asked tombazis as if
he really wanted to know he took the
cigar out of his mouth for a moment and
beamed down at her with a father-christ-
mas sort of expression

  because if you dont said nydia suc-
cinctly ill scream the place down

  no dear lady dont answered blazes
youd give me the trouble of coming down
and stopping you and i dont want to do
that because ive done most of my busi-
ness-got the diving-gear and a bit more
stores-and i want to take her out with
the tide in our favor dont interrupt me
please my beautiful lady

  im not coming back with you

 why

  im not open that door at once
nydia was in a fury her face was gera-
nium-colored her hands quivered with an
evident desire to claw some one to be
trapped like this-again it was unbear-
able

by beatrice grimshaw



  now just tell me why persisted tom-
bazis ive a reason for asking

  because i wont travel alone with you-
youre nothing better than a pirate

  i thought it was something of that
kind declared blazes with an expression
of innocent surprise wait till youve
seen the other passenger he isnt the sort
who would travel with pirates

  he what do you mean

  the boys were getting up sail the kiwai
had gone down to the engine-room vague
clankings were heard it was the flight
from oro over again nydia became nearly
frantic was she destined forever to lead
this nightmare flying-dutchman sort of
existence scouring the seas in company
with tombazis

  you wouldnt come with me this morn-
ing when i wanted you to go to church-
naughty declared tombazis indulgently
with fat uplifted forefinger so i had to
bring the church to you

  what do you mean

  mr hemingways said tombazis
would you mind just coming here and
looking down the skylight

  the scanty light in the cabin was dimin-
ished somewhat further and the space
beside tombazis filled up by another head
nydia stared at it amazed it was the
head of an elderly skinny man with a
loose mouth and reddish eyes the man
was vaguely refined-looking and at the
same time vaguely repulsive he wore a
worn black coat with a clerical collar

tjnderstanding came to nydia

    she saw that blazes had indeed got
the best of her he had bought-for
money or for drink-one of the derelict
parsons that may be found here and there
along australias northern coasts as it were
in the waste-bins of the continent-and
had brought him along for the voyage

  she saw the whole plan tombazis was
at the end of his patience that humorous
amiable manner of his if she knew men
was not more than skin deep and it was
about worn through he meant to deal
fairly with her according to his lights but
he did not mean to let her go during the
voyage she would be persuaded teased
frightened-who knew what-into marry-
ing tombazis

  and holliday was dead-she was certain
of it and stacy would be free to marry
mark plummer mark with the clear
crusader-face and the noble manner
the sands of oro

mark who could find gold-fields but
couldnt keep them who ought to have had
a wife like her to manage him and make
him rich oh it was unbearable the
world was falling to pieces

  she must scream-she would scream
even if tombazis came down next minute
and stopped her as he had amiably
threatened to do he couldnt kill her
anyhow now

  nydia was something of a singer she
knew how to place her voice the shout
she uttered went through the skylight like
a rocket and resounded clearly down the
wharf it happened to be dinner-time
now there was scarcely a human being
left about the jetty end one man a
white man carrying a suitcase and seeming
to be in a hurry heard the cry and paused
with a puzzled expression on his face
then he swung his suitcase up on his
shoulder and walked a little faster

  tombazis looking down through the sky-
light shook his finger again at nydia and
said to her amiably dont dear lady
i assure you youve no cause to worry
tell her she hasnt hemingways

  the red-eyed parson looked over his
shoulder and repeated obediently you
havent any cause to worry then he
added on his own account i am a fully
ordained clergyman of the anglican
church only temporarily-temporarily-
out of a parish captain tombazis who
is a very worthy man has kindly offered
to give me this interesting voyage i suffer
from weak health it will be a blessing to
me

  yes but what about me asked nydia
loudly and rudely

  you- began the clergyman out of a
parish but he was cut short in whatever
he might have been going to say the sky-
light darkened still further a man shoved
himself alongside of hemingways-a third
man who took no notice of him at all but
stared down into the cabin and called out
amazedly hallo miss leven what on
earth brings you here

  mr holliday cried nydia

chapter xv

ntydia leven if not specially gifted
 or highly educated in general was
clever-brilliant even-on one point any
circumstance or chain of circumstances
affecting herself she could sum up with

the blue

amazing quickness she saw in the mo-
ment following hollidays exclamation
what her game was and played it with-
out hesitation

  why mr holliday i am delighted to
see you she said casting a fascinating
glance up at the skylight it was true
she was extremely glad for more reasons
than one those stupid boys she went
on have shut me in and captain tom-
bazis was just coming down to let me out
i suppose you heard me call to him

  i did you squealed like a good one
was hollidays reply which for some oc-
cult reason he appeared to think witty
at all events he laughed his high-nosed
staring-eyed face looked grinningly down
the skylight nydias apparent plight
amused him it had clearly not occurred
to him that there was anything behind
appearances

  nydia felt her heart lift with relief she
had argued in the one swift moment given
her for thought that holliday was plainly
coming back with them that it would be
all right with him on board that no one
therefore need know anything if she didnt
tell she noted that the derelict parson had
already slipped away to his cabin he
wont yap she thought gladly using a
phrase of mark plummers for sheer delight
in thinking or talking like him was he
not a hundred times nearer to her now
with holliday recovered and going back to
stacy on board

 marry tombazis thought nydia
scornfully not likely-now

  whatever tombazis felt or thought no
one could say at this juncture that he did
not behave like a good loser quick as
nydia herself he saw that for the moment
the game was up with a courtly bow he
stepped to the companion hatch unbarred
it and handed nydia out remarking
gravely that the boys got more and more
careless every day and that what they
wanted one and all was a good hammer-
ing with the tail of a stingaree

  nydia still clutching her precious bun-
dle emerged and made for the cabin she
had quitted only a few hours before

  holliday was engaging the captain in
close talk and did not take any particular
notice of her she put down her treasures
in the berth and set to smooth her splen-
did hair to wash the red dust of thursday
island from her face and hands and by and
by to select a delightful negligee of gold-
colored silk embroidered in sea-blue and


book magazine



tie and twist herself into it one must
look ones best she said mark plum-
mer was hundreds of long sea-miles away
-but after all three men were three men

vutside as the kikenni edged away
from her moorings and began to breast
the seas holliday was relating to the cap-
tain at great length his many adventures
on board the aulis and afterward it did
not appear that anything of special note
had happened to him the doctor had de-
cided against operating holliday had re-
covered under careful treatment very
quickly he had been put ashoie at dar-
win spent a couple of weeks in hospital
there and gone down to thursday island
by the tai-yuen which had arrived and
left only the day before

  all the same mind you he was say-
ing when nydia came out again it was
touch and go wtith me touch and go if
the aulis hadnt come along i should have
snuffed out like a candle-whoof thats
what the doctor said he said to me
holliday said he but for your marvelous
constitution youd be lying at the bottom
of the arafura sea and he said that
never in all his professional practice had
he met with such wonderfully healing flesh
ive got very healing flesh always had
like a little child he opened his eyes
wide and stared solemnly at tombazis
who was jumping to get away to the helm

  wonderful agreed blazes hanging on
one foot

  and the officers-i never met such a
chatty pleasant tot they recognized me at
once for one of themselves-they said-
good lord whos that

  reverend mr hemingways barked
tombazis see you again wonder you
arent dead he looked with his mus-
tache drawn up over an ugly grin as
though some regret were added to the won-
der

   the jaws of the islands were opening out
tombazis first and last a sailor when on
his ship left without any ceremony his
passengers to amuse themselves and took
the wheel from the hands of the impassive
yassi-yassi boy who was holding it

  they pay pilots high about thursday
island for knowledge of the reefs than
which there are no cruder no more
treacherous in the seven seas of the world

it was tombazis boast that no pilot had
ever set foot upon the planking of the
kikenni or ever will he would add

by beatrice grimshaw

as long as davy jones locker and i are
strangers

  it was nearly an hour before he thought
fit to give over the wheel to a colored
quartermaster and see about his dinner
nydia tired out and piqued at the small
amount of notice shown to herself and her
finery had retreated to her cabin for the
two-to-four sleep customary among pas-
sengers at sea holliday who had shown
something like dismay at first sight of the
derelict parson seemed to have thought
better of it and was yarning with him
up in the eyes of the ship-quietest place
as blazes did not fail to remember for a
private talk he wondered what they
could be so busy over up there that
dam-fool holliday why in heavens name
hadnt he died when everyone wanted him
to hadnt moved since they cleared the
harbor he must have taken a mighty
fancy to the parson-or maybe they were
old friends

  it was nothing more than curiosity-of
which he had his full share-that moved
tombazis while the boy was laying his
dinner to stroll carelessly toward the bows
of the kikenni and lean over her side as
if estimating the depth of water underneath
her shearing keel he knew what the
downrush of wind from the bows could
do sometimes in the way of carrying talk

ttolliday did not know-which was
why he did not lower his voice more
than a trifle one had to speak clearly to
be heard above the noises of the ship the
kikenni wtell out at sea now was carry-
ing a bone in her teeth and growling over
it the engine had been shut off as soon
as they were out of the straits above
their heads the great foresail and main-
sail sang in the tearing breeze the booms
creaked as the schooner lay ever more and
more to leeward it was a glorious after-
noon a true sailors day

  something in the day the wind the pace
of the little ship may have pleased tom-
bazis he came aft again head thrown
back hands swinging lips humming gayly
as he went down to dinner

       soon beyond yon harbor bar

        shall my bark be sailing far

        oer the world i wander lone

       sweet belle mahone

        oer thy grave i weep good-by

        hear oh hear my bitter cry

       oh without thee what am i

       sweet belle mahone
the sands of oro



  he paused beside the shut door of
nydias cabin to repeat the last two lines
with expression there was no movement
inside tombazis grinned very cheerfully
considering the graveyard tone of his song
and went down the companion expressing
in music his desire that belle videlicet
nydia should wait for him at heavens
gate

  nydia who was beginning to know her
tombazis by now sat up in the berth lis-
tening her face took on a certain uneasi-
ness blazes was altogether too cheerful
it seemed to her for a defeated suitor

  i wish i was well out of this was her
conclusion she made up her mind that
she would seek hollidays company as
much as possible during the trip to oro
she judged by the run of the wind that
it would take them a good four days tom-
bazis wouldnt hurry

dut tombazis did the little engine
commonly kept for emergencies was put
into commission almost directly after leav-
ing thursday island and at an appalling
cost of gasoline beat out its steady six
knots an hour against a wind that was if
not a foul one certainly not fair with
the engine and a favoring slant now and
then they made way rapidly on the sec-
ond day out it became plain that the next
evening would see them back at oro
whatever his reason blazes was in a hurry

  nydia found that he troubled her sur-
prisingly little he was busy with the run-
ning of the ship having no white officers
and seemed to spend most of his time at
the wheel now and again when he
stepped off the wheel-grating to let a na-
tive take his place he would pause beside
her deck-chair and stand smiling down
at her but he never had anything in par-
ticular to say he seemed reserving some-
thing nydia wondered

  i dont care i dont she thought
hollidays alive and he cant change
that

  as they ran over seas of dark gentian
laced with foam by islands and islands
exceeding fair exceeding lonely where the
trade-wind-beaten sands were marked by
the thin feet of gulls and bosun birds the
trailing flippers of the turtle the shaky
winding tracks of hermit crabs and by
these alone-nydia watched with astonish-
ment strange things taking place on the
ship holliday whom she had marked
down as her especial cavalier for the voy-

the blue

age appeared to prefer the company of the
derelict hemingways to any other and
blazes still more oddly seemed fond of
his society too but neither of them
wanted the other about when talking with
the parson holliday would lure him away
into his old place in the bows of the ship
and there converse quickly eagerly while
hemingways sat on an upended meat-case
and stared at him with inexpressive eyes
it seemed at times as if the one were trying
to persuade the other and failing

  blazes on the other hand made himself
agreeable to the parson in a general open
way but nydia noticed that he only did
so when holliday happened to be out of
hearing he seemed to wish on the whole
that she should see how friendly he was
with hemingways he used to bring him
along to her and sit on the hatch beside
the two drawing them into mutual conver-
sation

  you know he isnt a bad chap he ex-
plained to nydia privately only the
one thing keeps him from being just like
anyone else

  as if that wasnt enough said nydia
contemptuously

  youre never very sorry for the under-
dog are you my beautiful lady asked
tombazis twisting his big cigar into one
corner of his mouth and looking at her
with staring pug-eyes

  when people get down so low its their
own fault was nydias verdict

  nothings ever anyones own fault al-
together dear lady commented blazes

  what awful nonsense

  not quite maintained the fat man
calmly smoking ever look at heming-
ways complexiqp

  why should i

  do look at it next time you talk and
look at his hands hemingways has been
dying in nasty ways for nine years

  what

  true sinabada thats what made
him take to drink and lost him his parish
in england its all facts that he tells
you-all about the parsonage with the ivy
and the roses and the pony-carriage and
the dear countess up at the castle asking
him to dinner something got him and it
had claws and he had to try and forget
the claws and he tried a bit too hard so
he had to come out to this beautiful coun-
try where none of his delightful friends
were and he went down and hes going

much-and works it out marrying people
when he marries us-

  he never will bit nydia

  when he marries us beautiful lady
with the golden hair itll be as legal as if
the archbishop of canterbury did it
hemingways has just got that one bit of
beautiful pride left in his delightful soul
his marriages hold tight hes properly
licensed and never marries in any diocese
where it doesnt carry

the kikenni running under sail this

   afternoon leaned hard to the stress of
the singing wind along her keel the
waters of the lonely reef-pricked coral sea
hated by shipmasters fled in furrows of
snow nydia wearied a little by the sight
of the empty streaming seas tired out with
tombazis long pursuit found herself won-
dering uncomfortably why he told her all
this surely he could not think she was
worrying about the legality of a marriage
that she had again and again declared
should not take place she looked vindic-
tively at him as he walked away with the
curious theatrical swagger that seemed to be
part of himself blazes always piled up
that swagger a little higher that usual when
he was feeling good what had he to feel
good about now

  lying back in her deck-chair she tried
to find again her mood of happy musing
but tombazis had effectively broken up
the dream she wished the voyage was
over she wished she had never come to
oro never come to new guinea the
schooner rolled abominably the wind was
sickly warm what a country what a
fool she was

  up in the bows holliday and the dere-
lict parson sat perched together dark
against the thin blue tropic sky they
were talking again

chapter xvi

jt on the evening of the third day
 after all did tombazis sight the island
an engine breakdown followed by con-
trary winds kept him back so that it was
the morning of the fourth day out just
after sunrise that saw the kikenni at last
beating up to oro

  on this there followed the longest day
of stacy hollidays life-a day that she
will not forget till that day when all things
are forgotten

by beatrice grimshaw

  the schooner could not make the island
island dwellers know these days to
some lives they have added years the
sailing-ship white in the offing big with
her freight of news long waited for hopes
long deferred the cruel wind that beats
her back and back so that she seems to
flutter wildly in the same place like a
bird trapped on a windowpane-the anx-
ious hearts in the iron-roofed beach houses
weary to see her hour by hour tack use-
lessly again and again there is but one
day that is a worse day for island folk
and that is the day on which birds gather
crying strangely underneath the trees and
leaves blow upward and turn white and
there comes a shield of livid brass upon
the face of the sky and men say looking
white-faced into the falling weatherglass
that the hurricane is near

  stacy had gone into her house and
dressed had ordered breakfast waited
vainly and taken her meal alone with
mark had seen the sun climb up the sky
and start on the homeward slope had pre-
pared and left untouched another meal had
gone fifty times down to the beach to look
and see if the boat were coming nearer
and still the kikenni hovered as if be-
witched by some cruel enchantment just
outside the reefs still the steady un-
friendly wind blew up and the blue was
ridged with foam-white horses away out at
sea galloping and galloping always away
from oro

  and she did not know her fate

  as that endless day went on it seemed
to her as if her heart were being torn out
by the roots today must settle all-
whether she was to be free and to marry
the man she loved or whether life to the
very end would mean a stumbling on a
stony road a chain stacy was normal
if most women were not marriage as an
institution would fall she like the aver-
age decent woman knew only one way out
and that was the way that had opened
when the malay had crept to hollidays
bed and thrust the knife into his side she
was past pretending the fierce trial of this
waiting day had burned away pretense
she knew that she wanted holliday to die

mark the man of iron showed no feel-
ing outwardly whatever may have been
taking place beneath his stoic calm he
busied himself all morning finishing off the
outside supper-table that he and stacy had
begun some days before they had found
it pleasant to take the last meal under
the sands of oro

the casuarina trees near the beach with
stars beginning to silver the dusky blue
and the wind humming sweetly mourn-
fully as it hums in the casuarina and the
casuarina only over their heads

  the table was made of split black palm
it was a gbod piece of work and wanted
only a last touch or two to be complete
with hammer saw and plane mark kept
at work looked seldom at the beating
wearied sail and spoke scarce at all

  yet all the time all the day he was
watching the woman he loved and there
was light of hope in his eyes

co sweet she looked so fine fine was
the word that came instinctively to
ones mind seeing stacy there seemed
to be some necessary link between the swift-
ness of her mind the bright courage of her
character and the clear drawing of ankle
and of wrist the spring of figure the up-
ward tilt of beautifully cut lips one felt
that just so must finest silky hair indefi-
nitely waving part softly above the fore-
head of a woman who was true as well as
fair in just that manner must her hands
be shaped her head set proudly on a little
neck stacys looks were stacy she was
a prize and she might be his--now

  the face of the pioneer told no tales
but nevertheless beneath its mask the
soul of the man was full of joy mark
trusted his luck

  stacy did not trust hers-perhaps be-
cause she felt to blame in counting on a
fellow-creatures death perhaps because
she like you and like myself tried to
cheat the dark gods by feebly pretending
that she did not really want what she did
want in any case fear as that heart-
wringing day went on took closer hold of
her she could not at the last have told
if she were glad or sorry when mark rais-
ing himself erect and sheltering his eyes
with his hand from the glare of the lagoon
called out to her

  look-i think hes got the engine going
at last

  so he has called stacy in reply she
ran for the glass and turned it on the

visibly nearing ship pins white

pins walking on the tiny deck-black pins
those were natives how many white pins
were there a thick one-that was nydia
a big one-that was tombazis who else

o	gods of luck and fate who else

  the glass jumped the ring of blue sky
and white-decked ship within it jumped

the blue

  and reeled with her reeling heart

her heart slowed down-down she sucked
at her suddenly dried lips     there
were two more white pins

  give me the glass a minute said
marks voice with the deep masculine
burr in it that she knew and liked

  there are four she heard her own
voice saying quite calmly mark looked
through the glass it did not shake as he
focused it and held it on the ship

  in a minute he handed it back to her
she saw that his face seemed suddenly to
cry out its age forty years-forty
years  but there was actually a smile on
it placed there heaven knew how when
he looked at her as he gave her back the
glass

  so its the long trail he said

  it was almost too much for stacy they
had been used to pass away some of the
evenings singing under the hurricane lamp
outside the palm-leaf house neither
had much voice but they had taken pleas-
ure now and then in joining marks
rather toneless bass and stacys patchy
mezzo in various popular songs such as
go well in outdoor life when folk are of
simple tastes and easily pleased the
long long trail was one

  theres a long long trail a-winding

  into the land of my dreams

  theres a long long night of waiting

  until my dreams all come true

  it was the long long trail indeed

either of the two doubted for a mo-

	ment that one of the white figures
now growing clearer in the low afternoon
sun as the schooner came straight ahead
was that of holliday who the other
might be they knew not nor cared it
was enough that the dead had arisen that
the man who should have been in his grave
was out of it stacy was not free

  yet if anything could have made mark
like her better than he did it would have
been her hurried exclamation as the boat
left the schooners side and began to glide
across the lagoon holliday visibly in the
stern with the rest

  oh dont lets grudge him life its so
good to be alive no matter what happens
poor charley i hope i never really wanted
him to die

  maybe you didnt answered mark a
trifle mote gruffly than usual but i did
there was no time for more

  out of the boat as she ran her nose up


book magazine



the shingly beach sprang like a jumping-
jack tombazis first of all

  well and how are all yer beautiful
selves he asked with the trace of irish
accent that generally came uppermost when
he wished to be ingratiating

  im going to have a talk with you pretty
dashed soon was marks far from hos-
pitable reply you want the thrashing of
your life

  what for asked blazes innocently

  yes what for echoed nydia leaning
on blazes outstretched hand as she
jumped off the boat she was not minded
to have anyone take up her battles in just
that fashion the trip to thursday island
was labeled now as a pleasure-frip only

  but mark was not very much concerned
about nydia nor did he mean to be
downed with holliday glooming in the
background and looking at stacy as if he
could have struck her

  for going off and leaving mrs holliday
with no lady on the island its been hor-
ribly dull for her and shes not too pleased
with you he maintained

  you can punch my head any time you
like and can asserted blazes with the ut-
most cheerfulness but it wont be for
any reason that i know of cant miss
nydia go down to t i to buy a few
pretties without asking your leave or mrs
hollidays

  of course i can declared nydia
stacy didnt mind-did you anastasia
de-ear she knew that stacy hated noth-
ing more than the full sound of her ab-
surdly formal name

  stacy glanced hurriedly at her husband
-the look of the slave as mark bitterly
thought

  oh no i-that is it would have been
more-less lonely if youd been here she
said somewhat lamely she wondered why
charley had not yet spoken he was climb-
ing out of the boat taking considerable
care of a pair of new white shoes and
after that first unpleasant glance he had
scarcely looked at her

  the other man came next and was in-
troduced by tombazis with the irish ac-
cent turned full on as me friend the
reverend mr hemingways come with me
for his health

  id like to knowdemanded mark who
seemed in no lamblike mood what busi-
ness you have to bring anyone on a trip
of this kind without my permission does
the place belong to you or to me

by beatrice grimshaw

  the reverend mr hemingways stand-
ing an odd black figure on the sun-
whitened beach seemed not at all annoyed
by this uncivil address he looked hard at
mark as if he were summing him up and
found the count not unpleasing

  i dont think youll find me in the
way he offered in a low refined voice
somewhat thickened by habitual drinking
there was unless i mistake a question
of a wedding-

  you do mistake came from nydia de-
terminedly

  perhaps perhaps he said without
looking at her he seemed to abstract
himself and fall away into a kind of
dream stacy wondered what charley was
going to say to her and when he would
begin she knew him too well to suppose
for an instant that he would take calmly
the idea of her staying alone with any man
under any circumstances whatever charley
was no cultivator of the charity that
thinketh no evil

  there was a moments silence among the
reunited party above their heads the
palm trees rattled like a thousand silken
dresses shaken in the wind the wester-
ing sun behind the hills of oro peered at
them red-eyed so youve come back
we didnt want you and we wish youd
go away the spirits of the island seemed
almost audibly to say

it was holliday who broke the silence

	looking sidewise at the parson he took
a step toward stacy the parson from
the midst of his dream seemed to keep
watch to note what holliday was doing
what he might say

  well was hollidays weak remark
well

  well charley was all that stacy
found to say she would not voice the
obvious im glad youre better she
knew she was not glad

  holliday looked at her in a cross-eyed
sort of way with his hands in his pock-
ets she wondered why he did not kiss
her she had made up her mind to that
expecting it she half shut her eyes

  there was a movement a sudden quiet
stacy opened her eyes full stare charley
had gone

  it was incredible but he had he was
walking toward the house with his hands
still in his pockets and his shoulders
hunched up in the way that always told
of sulkiness yet through some curious
the sands of oro



intuition stacy understood that his sulks
had not to do with her something-it
must be a big thing indeed-was occupying
his mind almost to the exclusion of herself
and plummer if that was so there was
a chance of justice only when holliday
lost his head in one of his silly quick
rages was he really unreasonable

  she felt her heart lighten without much
reason-did not the long long trail even
yet stretch before her and mark-the trail
that was as long as life itself still she
began to take an interest in what was
happening among the other people

  dont be a nasty crab plummer
tombazis was saying while the rusty-black-
clad parson sat on a palm log and looked
at them all with incurious eyes mr
hemingways wont get in the way of any-
bodys delightful business hes sick and
hell be all the better for a stay in a nice
healthy island like yours if you choose to
let him

  but plummers hard obstinacy was
awake

  this isnt a hospital he declared with
narrowing eyes you can take your pa-
tient elsewhere

  where my darling fellow demanded
tombazis curving his hands and bending
down to shelter the cigar he was lighting

it was certainly a windy evening the sun
was going down fast and the breeze get-
ting stiffer as day declined

  thursday island stated mark is
three days away daru is-

  oh exclaimed stacy the reverend
mr hemingways had punctuated the dis-
cussion by falling back from his log on the
ground displaying the soles of two worn
boots and a pair of thin bare ankles above
wrinkled socks

ftfark laughed shortly dashed ap-

  	propriate he said

  stacy turned on him like a little tigress

  you ought to be ashamed of yourself
she said hes really sick she was
down on her knees in an instant lifting
hemingways head and placing his thin
legs on the grass so that he lay easily
mark more concerned about her than
about the parson bent down to help

  the fellow is sick he allowed hem-
ingways face had turned an ugly greenish
yellow his eyes were rolled upward he
seemed trying to say something one hand
feebly pointed to his pocket

  stacy felt in the pocket and pulled out

the blue

a hypodermic syringe ready filled hem-
ingways tried to nod his head

  do you understand it asked mark
seeing by her face that she did not he
took the instrument twisted back shirt and
coat sleeves from hemingways arm and
slipped the syringe underneath the skin
driving the piston neatly home stacy
watched with dilated eyes

  almost immediately the greenish hue
left the mans face his eyes became nor-
mal and he attempted to sit up

  wait a bit temporized stacy

  the sun was nearly down now it was
beginning to grow dusk tombazis smok-
ing regarded the whole scene with a sort
of kindly toleration nydia looked frankly
disgusted i hate sickness i am so sensi-
tive she volunteered

  hush warned stacy hell hear she
was sitting on the grass with the head of
the semi-unconscious man pillowed in her
lap one arm as she leaned sideways sup-
porting his shoulder there was something
strangely motherly in her look as she half
nursed the derelict creature plummer
looking at her felt his heart grow warm
he remembered with fierce exultation that
there was no child of hers and hollidays

  therell be others-some day he said
to himself in that moment his belief in
his luck came back

  the man was reviving now he looked
up and through the growing dusk caught
a glimpse of a head bent over him felt a
soft arm about him holding protecting

  nydia aloof her sparkling face expres-
sive of cold disgust stood looking on and
waiting till the unpleasant incident should
end

  with sudden completeness hemingways
found himself he sat up

  youre a good girl-a kind girl my
dear he said blinking at stacy with his
drink-reddened eyes i had a girl once
-ah

  he rose unsteadily to his feet

  gimme your arm my dear to help me
to that house he said there was an odd
tone of authority about him thank you
-thank you im d- no im not-
mustnt forget the cloth but im blessed
as tombazis says if anyone shall do you
any harm

  i certainly hope no one will was
marks quiet comment he looked at the
melancholy wreck of a man as though he
were minded to ask questions but stacy
would not have it
book magazine	by beatrice grimshaw



  dont bother the poor thing she said
lets get him away to bed

  mark walked with her holding up hem-
ingways on the other side as they went
through the casuarinas toward the house
they met with holliday he eyed them
evilly in the falling gloom

  good night said hemingways sud-
denly and very loudly holliday looked
at him as if he would have liked to wish
him something much less pleasant but he
answered after some hesitation good
night and went off in the direction of the
mens house

  alone there sulking apparently he ate
his supper alone he stayed the night
marks new house was occupied by the
other men stacy and nydia in the wom-
ens house exchanged such confidences as
each saw fit to give they turned to sleep
not without some lingering distrust one of
another as each of them said silently
to herself who knew

  in the morning it seemed settled that
hemingways should stay

with the next day business began

     the tale of the giant octopus had
been told on the first evening drawing
screams of horror from nydia looks of
concern and of jealous anger mingled from
holliday and from tombazis a few sea
oaths less gentle than his usual bowdleriza-
tions it was agreed on all hands that the
octopus must die a charge of gelignite
was one of the requisites that the kikenni
had brought back from thursday island

  the diving dress too was brought to
the long beach and the pump belonging to
the outfit hemingways stayed in camp
the rest of the party joined forces and went
off looking like a picnic nydia had as
usual made a toilet stacy looked bright
in her long smock of workmanlike blue
linen tombazis was resplendent in new
socks and tie there was talking and
laughing a stranger joining the party
for the first time would have thought it the
most light-hearted band of holiday-makers
he had met in a year

  yet underneath the talk the brightness
flowed fierce currents holliday had
scarce spoken to his wife since he landed
stacy was growing momently more and
more uneasy as to what he could possibly
mean by this determined silence so unlike
his usual character mark plummer was
sick at heart with jealous rage nydia was
angry because plummer did not notice her

much tombazis was chafing because he
noticed her at all they trod the coral
sands of oro they passed beside the fair
blue-crystal bays and under the low hills
green as parrots feathers they went from
end to end of the little land that was free
of all sorrow all bitter care and cruel ri-
valry and everywhere they went they
sowed these things thick as invisible weed-
seeds in the spiritual atmosphere that had
until their coming remained pure

  will those who sail to oro in future
years feel as these men and women felt on
landing the wonder of an unflawed crystal
peace one cannot tell one thinks it may
not be so

they had reached the reef the tide was
low today but not an octopus showed
anywhere about the runnels and pools it
appeared that tombazis and holliday had
both gone down in divers dress before
but that mark plummer had not tom-
bazis nowadays could get into no ordinary
sized dress the honor therefore of mak-
ing the first descent devolved on holliday
or would as soon as the octopus was set-
tled

  charley at this began to boast

  i like going down he said done it
four times before did it at broome years
ago and once in t i and once at sa-
marai ive got what you call a natural
talent for it never bothered me from the
first they put me down-whoof-and i
knew the whole thing managed my air like
an old hand didnt tumble on my head and
i never was afraid lots of people are
theyre very brave while youre getting
them into the dress and putting on the
helmet but when you tell them to get over
the side of the ship and they see the water
coming up their legs why most of the
beggars chuck it and beg to be taken back
fact ive seen it but not i i showed
them from the first

  that was very nice of you commented
tombazis so gently that nydia felt sure
there was mischief coming youre a
wonderful man now i remember you were
never sick on board the kikenni were
you sick anywhere else

  never lied holliday cheerfully
dont know what it is

  you do all your throwing off on land
dont you my darling chap asked tom-
bazis stacy who knew the australian-
ism and understood what a crass insult was
conveyed by the accusation of throwing
the sands of oro

off-namely bragging-felt uneasy for
a moment but blazes had judged his man
better holliday missed the implication
and went on telling of his wonderful deeds
plummer who had avoided speaking to
holliday now began to look at him in a
way that made stacy uneasy

  oh arent we going to get at the oc-
topus she asked hurriedly the papuan
diving-boys who had been brought with
the party were standing about in the coral
pools staring at nothing the sun was get-
ting high outside the reef where the
giant octopus had its lair there was not
a sign to show that only two nights before
those terrible steel arms had been cast far
and wide into the harbor of the lagoon
it might not be the safest place in the world
for hanging about in but nobody remem-
bered that or would have troubled about
it if anyone had remembered

dlummer let no man do the handling

	of the gelignite but himself

  too many one-armed men in papua al-
ready he explained briefly stacy who
knew his utter recklessness where only he
was concerned smiled a little as she saw
him trimming his fuse with meticulous care
-neither too long nor too short-cutting
it in halves and lighting the spare half to
test its burning before he put the first
into the package of gelignite it was like

mark to consider others charley

would have cut the fuse to a couple of
inches and used it untested just to show
his pluck

  all of you get out of the way ordered
mark taking his stand on the edge of the

reef no farther than that

thatll do keep there he lit a match

  stacy had a bad moment when she real-
ized just why mark had planted the rest
of the party so well out of the way she
of all people alive had reason to know how
long the terrible steel arms were how far
into the lagoon they might reach mark
had put everyone well out of danger-ex-
cept himself

  there was a tense moment of expectancy
no one moved the sound of the tide
licking slowly out among the reef pools
was like the last breaths of a dying man

  the package flashed up and fell there
was a huge thumping explosion almost
in the same moment mark stepped actively
off the reef edge and half walked half
ran back through the lagoon toward the
rest of the party

the blue

  a shriek from nydia followed the ex-
plosion something long-very long dark
and whiplike-had flung itself out of the
water within a yard of mark and swept
past him like a cable-end sweeping the
wharf when it breaks on the bollard and
scatters death around the thing shone
wetly in the sun it had white spots-one
could not tell where it began to whip
about furiously

   oh run run said stacys lips silently
it was almost a prayer

  mark threw a look over his shoulder

  dont worry its done he called in
the moment of his speaking the thing sank
down and began to wriggle like a cut
worm among the coral pools then it slid
-back back like a snake going home it
slipped across the edge of the reef yard by
yard weight only was dragging it back
the life had gone

  grappling irons ordered mark fol-
lowing the coils as they slipped

  right said tombazis who was close
on his heels those lovely things they
dont float once theyre dead give me the
grappling iron ive harpooned whales in
my time

tie stood on the edge an immense bulky
figure beside the tall leanness of mark
and cast the grappling-iron with a prac-
ticed hand it was touch and go the oc-
topus lead-heavy was already well under
water and sinking but the iron caught the
flesh of a long tentacle and held droop-
ing downward awash in the tide the horror
of the seas swung helpless dead

  mark leaning over stared at it fasci-
nated not often he knew did man have
a chance to see such a sight and live to
tell it after the dead thing had been
badly shattered by the gelignite which had
at the same time blown a great lump out of
the reef its body big as one of the giant
buoys that roll in harbor tides was a mere
mass of gray tatters two or three arms
were severed the saucer-like sucker-
plates showed as the feelers swayed about
the thing was splashed and spotted with
its own ink an eye that had escaped
floated loose on the surface of the water
black and white big as a dinner-plate

  by gosh asserted blazes she was a
lovely one youve bust her up all right
must have been dead when the feeler came
thrashing about

  yes-muscular action like the tail of
a lizard when the lizard sheds it and


book magazine

leaves it kicking about like a worm
theyre hard to kill but this one is done
boys you can have him to eat

  howls of joy accompanied the securing
of the food the natives who had been
keeping well away rushed in and hacked
the terrible arms to pieces with their
knives loading themselves with lumps of
whitish-gray semitransparent meat

  miss nydia said tombazis as the
women began cautiously to approach
you shall have something good-you cant
think how good-for supper tonight he
reached down and hooked a lump of meat

  shall i said nydia with interest
ive heard of it

  do you want any asked plummer of
stacy

  she shuddered

  i cant bear even to look at it she
said i feel it all over me again holding
me--dragging-ah 

  well i dont much like eating crawly-
bugs of any kind myself so here goes
he drew the iron out the rest of the
huge shattered mass of body and tentacles
sank heavily waving as it went like coils
of giant seaweed before it was out of
sight black shark-fins began to show near
the reef in a minute looking down the
human watchers saw long yellowish bodies
horribly flexible darting at the dead mon-
ster and tearing into it as it sank

  that stops diving for today was
marks comment

  surely no one means going down in such
a place demanded stacy

  i shouldnt mind a bit loudly pro-
claimed her husband im not afraid of
sharks once in t i-

  tomorrow will be reasonably safe
went on mark as if he had not spoken
ill take the first trip-

  you why you havent-

  no but everyone has to begin some-
time and i may as well say-since were
all in it-that ive been pretty certain ever
since those malays were done for crossing
the reef just here that the old jap put his
stuff somewhere in the neighborhood it
was a queer grotesque sort of idea just
what youd expect from a jap you can
all have a look at this he produced the
shell and passed it round

  ah ive seen that said nydia with
superiority

  stacy wanted to add so have i but
restrained herself the men put their
heads together and handled the shell

by beatrice grimshaw



  by ginks but this is interesting com-
mented blazes what do you suppose this
line of dots means are they dots or-
mark gave him a quick look

  i think they might be or myself he
said it does seem a big lot of fuss to
make over a smallish thing doesnt it
holliday looked from one to the other
whats the idea he asked

  when you go down my darling man
said blazes pleasantly youre liable to
find out

ctacy looked from one to another she
 understood too clearly for her pride
just how they classed the man who was her
portion out of a world of men men
among themselves can be brutally plain

  charley of course did not see he
never did see when people wanted to snub
him his vanity was armor

  i shall go down he said the first
thing inthe morning ill-

  plummer and tombazis were clearly not
listening the big man spreading himself
about in wide greek gestures and talking
excitedly in an irish accent was telling
mark just where he thought search ought
to be made

  ye see me dear man he was declar-
ing the beautiful reef just here goes in
in places like the fingers of a blessed hand
see that sort of breakwater shticking out
if it hadnt been there the octopus couldnt
have stopped i know them the beautiful
darlings and they dont like the open sea
hitting them too hard well there it was
the lovely thing in its hole hanging on
to the reef wall and sheltered by the bit
that was a breakwater and alongside of
it-see 

  the reef as blazes said did in this
place somewhat resemble a hand fingers
being represented by long tongues of coral
and spaces between by greenish-blue shal-
lows filled with rocks of silver

  in there me darling man-in there
where its shallowish and where the big
deeps alongside-

  and where the octopus sat like a guard-
ian devil-i see i see a dashed ingeni-
ous beggar that old jap mark bent
over the reef-edge and stared to left of
him depths unplumbed black-blue went
starkly down to right a little way ran
out the coral fingers guarding shallower
channels that were colored turquoise green

  the sharks between the green and the
blue went nosing about tearing the last
the sands of oro

of the great octopus slivory flesh it was
blood-chilling to see them so near not stiff
like other fish but horribly flexible hide-
ously intelligent looking up with cold green
eyes-to watch them moving at their hate-
ful work yet hear no sound

  well said mark straightening up
for tomorrow boys bring back the
dress to the house ill have the first try in
the morning

  oh no you wont laughed holliday
maliciously

  mark paid no attention to him at all
he walked on across the shallows leaving
the rest to follow

  plummet- wont go down tomorrow
maintained holliday addressing tombazis
now

  why wont he asked the latter
shortly

  because the dress is too small for any-
one but myself

  the helen of troy it is who says
so i ordered it full size from harry
kiriko and i saw it sent on board just be-
fore we cast off

  yes so did i and i saw it was small
you were too busy getting up the-

  why you beautiful blessed-you-
why didnt you let me know

  wasnt my business said holliday
mulishly

  tombazis looked at him swelled and
gasped once or twice as if about to blow
up from the pressure of violent language
contained within and then with a frantic
gesture of his large hands strode off behind
mark plummer nydia and stacy were
already well away but not quite out of
earshot

lli ark fortunately was not with the
women of the party when tombazis
found him and he had therefore no diffi-
culty in expressing just what he felt when
he found out that the only member of the
party qualified to use the dress was holli-
day

  i dont trust him as far as i can throw
him he said at the end of a brief but
effective commination service

  nor do i agreed tombazis there
were no frills on his speech now alone
with men he was a different tombazis
and whats more i believe he knows
something you and i dont

  how could he

  i dont know but hes as cunning as a
basket of weasels theres something up

the blue



between him and the parson that i dont
quite get aboard of though ive guessed
quite a lot of it

  by the way why did you bring that
parson honestly

  honestly mark old son i brought him
to marry that little et cetera of a nydia
and me

  marry her marry a wildcat

   cats have their points persisted tom-
bazis i like cats always have one or
two about the kikenni

  she wont have you said mark twist-
ing his mustache thoughtfully though the
least vain of men he was not minded to
deny an obvious conquest

  make your mind easy replied tom-
bazis she will

  bet you five pounds

  done itll buy me two new white
suits in t i 

you seem jolly certain of winning
its so much a certainty said blazes
that i dont like the idea of taking your
money id even venture another bet
but-

  what

  youre an impulsive sort of a cow at
times you might knock my head off
mark suddenly blushed scarlet

  i havent the least idea what you
mean he declared hurriedly dont you
think it must be time to turn in

they were strolling under the casuarina
 trees in the cool night wind that drew
up from the lagoon stars bright and many
hung among the dark-tressed branches like
little magic fruits of gold stars made long
pencilings of light in the sea-water some
way off the henna glow of the hurricane
lamps showed dimly inside the palm-leaf
houses

  tombazis bent forward and laughed
soundlessly till he shook

   youd best not do that too often com-
mented plummer disapprovingly you
might burst

  i feel like it but i wont-i wont
he stopped in front of mark and slapped
him hard on the shoulder i want to
burst he said i want to blow up you
watch me when i do

  if youre not quite mad finish your
smoke and come on in dont you ever
sleep asked mark he did not seem par-
ticularly curious

  tombazis turned back toward the
houses as the two men walked together
book magazine



they almost ran into a third-heming-
ways

  good night your reverence bellowed
tombazis hope youre better

  much better thanks i think the place
agrees with me-as much as any place
can was the derelicts answer  he passed
them and walked on alone

  mark plummer some while after saw
him coming back he was with holliday
the two separated just as they reached the
square of light cast by the open door of
the mens house it seemed as if they did
not want to be seen together

chapter xvii

mow said tombazis are you ready

  the kikennis whaleboat was moored
inside one long finger of the reef the
pump was on board tombazis had gone
over it tested it and pronounced it fit to
be trusted with the life of a man the
air-tube was in order the valves of the
dress working tombazis had with his
own hands screwed tight the nuts that fas-
tened holliday into his little prison the
lifeline was in place the weights were on

it still remained to close the opening
through which hollidays arched nose and
prominent eyes looked forth by screwing
up the front glass after that the man
would be for all practical purposes deaf
and dumb in another minute he would
die the little death that divers all day
long are dying he would be out of sight
and hearing out of reach save through the
medium of the lifeline buried at the bot-
tom of the sea

  ready aye ready answered holliday
boastfully he could not even don a div-
ing dress without showing his essential
cheapness of nature yet he was no coward

it is a mixture more often met with in real
life than in fiction which persists in re-
garding the boastful man as essentially
poor-spirited

  theres no sharks about said tom-
bazis its a beautiful day in every way

he spoke much as if sharks were in the
nature of flies or mosquitoes annoyances
that came or went with the weather not
a ripple-no ground-swell even might
have been made for you down you go

he screwed in the glass and flung his own
weight on the opposite gunwale as holli-
day crawled over the edge of the whaleboat
and down the rope-ladder

by beatrice grimshaw

  to stacy who had never seen a man go
down before the sight was nerve-shaking-
it seemed so like deliberate suicide she
could not help admiring her husband for
once it was certainly a brave thing to

do sitting in the dinghy which

had been brought out for her and nydia
she looked fearfully over the side there
he was-there-a dark thing going down

and downhe had reached the end

of the ladder now with a sudden drop and
swirl he disappeared and there was no
more holliday only a small stream of bub-
bles coming swiftly up and bursting in sil-
ver on the tourmaline green of the sea

  for quite a while now as it seemed to
her they sat in the dinghy waiting-listen-
ing to the faint sucking of the water against
the deep sea-wall to the regular sighing of
the air-pump to the pat-pat-pat of the
tides soft hands against the keels of whale-
boat and dinghy stacy looked down at
her own hands and at her arms in their
short sleeves burned to the color of bark
she looked out across the islets and the
reefs noticing as she did how the out-
door life of oro had lengthened her sight-
she could see almost as one does through a
telescope she could hear like a bat or a
bird-not a sound among the reef pools or
in the air was missed by her-a faintly
splashing fin a fish-hawk ever so far up
that called to its unseen mates was loud
as something spoken at her elbow she
felt the life of the open air and the sun
warm powerful equable coursing through
her veins she knew she could not have
told how that she had grown on this far
island prettier than ever before she had
been in her life she was glad-very glad
of that so ran her thoughts

  and all the time the other half of her
mind was down at the bottom of the sea
with charley wondering what he was look-
ing for-what he would find like every-
one else in the party she had caught the
contagion of the idea that there was a
mystery about the island that the original
idea of a simple cache of stolen pearl-shell
was very far from covering the ground the
mystery seemed close to her now the shut
door stood almost visible before her
eyes

  she waited

xtydia as soon as holliday disappeared
 had put him out of her mind she
was much more interested in mark who
had been staring at her that day-he was
the sands of oro

staring at her now she knew though he
managed to avert his eyes every time she
looked up she thought it seemed hopeful

  if she had known it was and it was not
mark was taking just that interest in her
that all men take in a possible bride he
was turning over in his mind tombazis
words of the night before and speculating
as to what lay behind them he knew
men and the world of men well enough to
understand that blazes bet had been
grounded on no empty boast and yet-

  he turned his thoughts to his own affairs
they looked bad the luck that he had
blindly counted on-the gamblers gold-
finders luck that had never failed him yet
-seemed to have taken wings he saw
in that moment of depression no possible
chance of ever calling stacy his own

  it was nydias moment had she but
known it there is always the moment
when the woman is in earnest many a
love deserted many a wife who has had to
forgive knows that-bitterly

  mark plummer loved stacy as he had
never even dreamed of loving any woman
in all his wandering career but he was
a man and nydia as the probable cap-
tive of tombazis became interesting to
him and she loved him and stacy was
not for him-ever

  more things than one mans life hung at
the end of a string were trembling in the
balance just then

  nydia always tuned keenly as a wire-
less receiver to catch flying thoughts about
herself looked up again she met marks
glance and this time he did not withdraw it

  at the same moment stacy leaning over
the side of the dinghy in which they all
were sitting cried out

  hes coming up

  in an instant every eye was fixed upon
the water a dusky shadow underneath
the whaleboat was rising-rising tom-
bazis attendant boy was hauling in as fast
as he could go

  a huge shiny metal head popped out
looking with its glaring front and side
glasses like some unbelievable sea-monster
coming up to take the air the boy helped
holliday over the side of the whaleboat
his front glass was unscrewed and a red
puffing face became partially visible in-
side

  what luck demanded tombazis
mark did not speak at all his hatred
for holliday and distrust of him had been
at boiling point for the last twenty-four

the blue

hours he could not trust himself to ask a
question he was fully assured that the
accident of the small-size dress if it had
not been maneuvered altogether by holli-
day had been at the least deliberately
concealed by him

  give one time to breathe grumbled
holliday and then through the window
theres nothing you may as well get
me out of the dress

comething told stacy-who knew her
charley-that he was not speaking the
truth if he had found nothing he would
have said damned dress and cursed at
tombazis while he was being unfastened
and unscrewed he was altogether too
amiable to her mind

  whatever the others felt they said lit-
tle mark was utterly silent but when
stacy stole a glance at him she saw that
his black eyebrows had come down over
his eyes like ruled lines and that his mouth
looked angry tombazis let out a string
of the absurd misfit oaths he affected
nydia cried what a pity and then a
silence fell upon the party and the boats
rocked idly with a slapping sound upon
the tourmaline sea

  all for nothing was it possible the
long voyage to oro the patient hunting
through reefs and rocks and sands the
troubles that had arisen threatening to
tangle in their common threads the peace
and happiness of at least four lives all
for nothing not even a pearl-shell

  going down again asked tombazis

  not i was hollidays answer get
me out of the thing whats the use
i walked all over the place-stayed till
i was near paralyzed im all out of prac-
tice-and there wasnt a thing but coral
and fish and seaweed not a thing

  lord man youve got to try another
beautiful place we cant give up like that
declared tombazis

  you may jolly well try yourself-if you
can replied holliday it seemed he
knew very well that the whip hand was
his he waited till tombazis under pro-
test and the native had taken off the dress
and then allowed himself with the rest of
the disappointed party to be rowed away
home

  stacy looking at mark wondered what
would come next charley had gone too
far he always did his gigantic egotism
invariably stood in the way of his obtain-
ing a fair view of other mens minds when


book magazine



his own interests were in any way involved

he did not realize that he was waking up
a dangerous devil in mark plummer
everyone could see that there was some-
thing crooked about the affair that mark
was being cozened somehow and mark
was not the sort of person to cozen

 what was charley up to she could
only guess that he had found the shell
maybe more than anyone guessed and that
he meant to keep the secret to himself
returning no doubt to oro island by and
by alone when the patience of the other
treasure-seekers should be worn out

if she was guessing other people were

  busy in the same manner it was not
an hour after their return when mark
seeing her seated under the casuarina trees
by the shore came up with what she called
his business face on and told her to come
down to the anchorage with him she
rather liked his abrupt little ways when
he had some practical matter to deal with

he was always courteous in the things that
mattered

  near the anchorage there were two or
three shallow caves-early in the search
dismissed as possible hiding-places and not
used as shelters since they faced away
from the southeast trades and were con-
sequently rather warm they were how-
ever well suited for a private talk

  in one of the caves seated on a low
rock she found tombazis and nydia ob-
viously waiting there was an atmosphere
of committee-meeting about the whole
party nydia for once did not seem to
be thinking of her appearance and wras
not even smoothing or patting her wonder-
ful hair tombazis had let his cigar go
out and was sitting with hands on knees
serious-faced he is like a pug thought
stacy

  mark found a seat for her and took one
himself

  we dont want to hurt your feelings
he began but we have to tell you we all
think your husband is not playing fair

  i should think not said nydia un-
able to resist a pinprick directed at the
woman who owned a real husband and a
real admirer too-worse owned the ad-
mirer she had marked for herself we
think he is behaving very badly she went
on

  dont you think you had better say all
that to himself was stacys answer the
meekest of wives the least happy cannot

by beatrice grimshaw

easily endure to hear her property depre-
ciated in public

  ill say it to himself fast enough by
and by replied mark but for the mo-
ment we have to hold our little council
without him wte cant hold it without you
you know unconsciously his voice took
on the tone that a mans voice holds when
he speaks of love and the loved one
nydia eyed him with green jealousy

  where is my husband asked stacy

  nobody replied for a moment then
tombazis to save the reply he saw rising
to nydias lips put in somewhat hastily

  he-hes tired and having a camp in
the house so is the parson

ctacy had seen half an hour before a
boy carrying up from the schooner to
to the house a case marked with hollidays
name she flushed and then turned pale
so is the parson- everyone seemed to
be coupling these two together holliday
and the parson-both with their feet now

on the one black roadit wanted

only that

  plummer saw but saw also that there
was nothing to be said this loved woman
must bear her owtn sorrows he not helping
he who would have-

   hid her needle in his heart

   to save her little finger from a scratch

   no deeper than the skin

  what a damned thing life is anyhow
he thought to himself writh his lips he
said

  we dont mean to give the matter up
of course blazes could go down to t i
for a diver-if necessary

   stacy was silent she felt there was more
behind

  the fact is- said mark and-stopped

  oh me beautiful man cut in tom-
bazis let me say it in my own way the
fact is mrs holliday that were going to
knock the lovely head off that beautiful
husband of yours if he doesnt tell what he
knows and so we give you warning

  stacy opened her mouth shut it again
opened it she felt she must look like a
frog

  charley she put in weakly has
learned boxing he used to win things
he- she stopped feeling the situation
to be starkly impossible it must be plain
to these people that she wras not as she
seemed to be speaking in her husbands
favor what was she trying to do
the sands of oro

  mark was looking at her but he had
shut off all expression from his eyes they
were like bits of hard blue-gray glass

  im going to put it to him tomorrow
he said today would hardly be fair
play ill tell him-

  you will not my darling fellow i
will

  we wont quarrel about it especially
before- some one will tell him that if
hes got hold of any information he may
give it up or fight for it that seems to
me a fair deal if there can be any sort
of fair dealing in such a matter mark
spoke with his committee manner you re-
membered that he was in demand among the
men of papua wherever clear and accurate
presentment of any case was wanted-in
planters and miners associations in depu-
tations meetings stacy could almost hear
the unspoken have you anything to
say which out of courtesy to her he
omitted at the end

  she answered it unspoken as it was

  i can only say im ashamed of him if
its true and ill try my best to get him
to give you his confidence

  thats what we wanted said mark
its always best to settle things peace-
ably when you can is that all

  nydia and tombazis mutely agreed that
it was

  then i should think we might be go-
ing back to the house

  they found no holliday there however
when they arrived the derelict heming-
ways who had clearly had as much as he
could carry but who equally clearly
seemed to carry it well told them that
holliday was gone out to lie down in the
shade somewhere i think said mr
hemingways choosing his words carefully
that he was somewhat fatigued

  stacy scarlet with shame understood him
only too well she could not stay with the
others-nydia who would be spitefully
sympathetic tombazis who would laugh at
it as a good joke mark who would know
exactly what she was feeling and pity hec
she left them all sitting about the camp
under a group of windy wailing casuarinas
and went away by herself down to the
shore again mark had the tact not to fol-
low her

  among the palms that fringed the back
of the beach she walked restlessly miser-
ably up and down had there not been
misfortune enough before that charley
must take to drink how was she go-

the blue

ing to bear it how endure his company
when he made up his mind to forgive her
that which he knew she had not done and
take her back again

  misery rose to flood tide she walked
madly up and down in the westering sun-
light she did not know how long she
had been there she did not know when she
could face the others again the sun was
in her eyes as she turned once again to
walk through the seaward grove it daz-
zled her so that she did not see until she
was quite close upon it a dark silhouette
advancing toward her-the unmistakable
thin bent figure of the derelict heming-
ways for whom nobody was sorry

  stacy herself was not sorry in that -
ment she choked back an impatient ex-
clamation and turned toward the unshel-
tered sand

  hemingways stood in her way for a mo-
ment as she passed held out a shaking
hand and said-what did he say some-
thing silly drunken absurd listen-
you must listen-in the intres of mrality
what did he mean she tried to pass him
he kept getting in the way he was un-
deniably drunk in the intres of m-m-
ralty mrs holliday always been a prin-
ciple of mine marry them i always say
-intres of-

  she dodged him and fled

the evening was a positive nightmare

    holliday had turned up again appar-
ently not a scrap the worse for a whole af-
ternoon spent in drunken stupor indeed
he seemed the better forit for he was cer-
tainly more amiable he did not even
resent his obvious banishment to coventry
at the hands of tombazis and plummer
he spoke to hemingways now and then
and seemed almost inclined to boast of
having been vilely drunk at all events he
referred to it with a sort of bravado more
than once hemingways who had been
fighting his own particular devil with fire
had nothing at all to say he gazed dully
about him and sometimes fell asleep

  mark on whose tact one might always
depend did his best to loosen the tension
by bringing out cards but tombazis was
not inclined for play and nydias offer
could not be refused and when they were
established at the black palm table blazes
became jealous and talked to nydia loudly
and determinedly spoiling the game
stacy wearying of the wretched scene of
disagreement and distrust left the party

and lamp in hand went down to the kitchen
to attend to her usual duties as store-
keeper nothing had been given out for
breakfast yet and it was nearly time for
the boys to go to sleep

  she found them every one sleeping
laid out on the grass about the cookhouse
so utterly dead to the world that she had
to bend down and shake the cooky-boy in
order to wake him

 whats the matter with you she
asked have you been getting at the
betel-nut again for stacy was by this
time familiar with the new guinea house-
wifes curse

  no beeselnut said the cooky me
too much blanky tired sinabada alto-
gether boy he too much blanky tired

  stacy looked at them they seemed to be
telling the truth

  what on earth has tired you she
asked but over the faces of the papuans
one and all dropped suddenly the sullen
expression that the white man knows too
much work spat out one boy briefly
and that was all they would say

  stacy gave out her stores and came
back puzzled was she going mad and
suspecting mysteries everywhere or were
there really mysteries on the island

mext morning the tension seemed to
have increased to the breaking-point
stacy had had no chance of speaking to her
husband who had vanished after break-
fast but tombazis and plummer never-
theless were determined to carry out their
plan stacy half hysterical by now and
not knowing whether she felt most like
laughing or crying at the sight saw them
actually drawing lots with straws in a cor-
ner near the mens house nydia was
shamelessly peeping through a rent in the
palm-leaf wall of the womens house
stacy thought her rather underbred until
she realized that she was doing just the
same thing herself-by the medium of two
open and opposite doors

  marks got the longest proclaimed
nydia it seemed to be true tombazis
flung his straw on the ground angrily and
walked away mark looked after him for
a moment and then deliberately rolled up
his sleeves and took in a hole in his belt
he looked about neither of the women
were in sight he asked a question of a
native and set off with long determined
strides through the grass

  are you coming asked nydia in an

unnecessary whisper putting on her hat
i wouldnt miss it for anything

  stacy opening her mouth to say deter-
minedly that she would not even think of
such a thing found herself before she had
had time to speak running hard alongside
of nydia in the grass that mark had just
passed through

  i must be there to stop it she
thought i cant allow such a thing i
never thought-

  she was beginning to be badly fright-
ened these masculine passions--these
hot loves violent hatreds and jealousies-
were dangerous things to let loose here
alone on oro away from all the world
only two well she knew that a fight be-
tween her husband and mark would have
no real reference to its apparent cause
she herself would be the cause she could
not-she could not- why hadnt tomba-
zis drawn the longer straw that would
have been another thing altogether

  run faster she urged nydia hes
right out of sight

  he got a start gasped nydia who was
not built for speed but she kept on
bravely the grass ended in a stretch
of open pandanus ground they caught
sight of two khaki figures

  keep back now warned nydia if
they see us they wont fight

  do you-do you think i mean to
let- gasped stacy dropping into a quick
walk

  you dont mean to stop them cried
nydia why therell be no end of fun
she barely dissimulated her open convic-
tion that mark was in any case bound to
win it was almost as if she boasted

  im certainly not going to let them
fight like two disgraceful prize-fighters
declared stacy walking faster come on
if you wont i will run down this slope

youll catch them quickercharley

mr plummer ah

che gave a cry and started running
    harder than ever

  the two men were in sight close together
and as nydia delightedly put it dodging
to hit mark had his back to the women
holliday did not see them or if he did did
not mind he had enough to do guarding
his own head from the lightning blows that
mark was delivering any man who un-
derstood the sport would have called it
very pretty stacy wanted to stop them
-to scream-she did not know what
the sands of oro

  nydia gave a cry of delight

  marks got him-hes punched him a

good one oh what are they

stopping for

  one of charleys teeth has been
knocked out said stacy very pale its
hideous i- she began to move for-
ward nydia caught her by the skirts

  dont spoil it she begged theyll
start again directly i cant see why they
stopped anyhow men dont worry over a
thing like- good heavens

  there was some reason for her cry
they had both seen holliday a moment
before spit out a small white thing on the
ground they now saw him drop half a
dozen after it spitting blood at the same
time for one of marks blows had gone
home on his upper lip and split it

  he cant have hit out all those de-
clared nydia does your husband wear
false- lord marks picking them up is
everybody mad

  discarding all attempt at concealment
she ran down the slope followed by stacy
the two men wheeled round as the
women appeared holliday one hand up
at his mouth seemed to be feeling his in-
juries and at the same time feeling for
something that was not there mark
plummer was holding in the palm of one
hand seven or eight large round pearls
a red-hot epithet had just hurtled through
the air toward holliday the coming of the
women stopped others that were appar-
ently ready to take flight after it

  so thats it is it asked mark breath-
ing hard so you didnt know anything
and wouldnt speak-no wonder with that
in your mouth you saw me coming and
hadnt time to- where are the rest of
them

  damned if i tell you anything was
holli lays answer he turned his head
aside and spat blood on the ground
what do you want here he demanded
of stacy get back to your kitchen

rn the pandanus slope behind a gentle
 song sung in a voice tha was any-
thing but gentle began to sound as tom-
bazis with careful carelessness strolled
toward the excited group trying to look as
if he had come there entirely by accident

  from my fond lips the eager answers fall

   thinking i hear thee call

sang the understudy of bully hayes ad-
vancing toward the excited group

the blue



  so hes told you was his comment
he has not told me he spit these
out on the ground when i hit him mark
held up the handful of pearls they were
of different sizes one or two very large all
perfectly round and shining with the blue-
white luster that in t i the home of
the pearl industry marks a perfect
stone

  tombazis blew a long significant whis-
tle in the brief silence that followed the
four white people looked at each other
stacys eyes were fixed on the sulky down-
bent countenance of her husband she was
flaming all over with the shame that he
clearly did not feel at all nydia and
tombazis too stared at holliday mark
plummer calmly pulling down his sleeves
kept his eyes on hollidays wife wthat
would this last discovery mean to her

  from a pandanus tree above them a
leatherneck burst out suddenly in the
weird bad language used by these strange
birds

  yer a regular cockolly-co yer a reg-
ular cockolly-co yer a reg-

  the group under the trees did not hear
it they would scarce have heard a hurri-
cane had one broken over their heads just
then it seemed as if no one knew who
should speak first or what should be said
holliday solved the problem

  whats all the damn fuss about he
said impudently cant i look for pearls
where i like

  why you- mark began and broke
off he went on with visible restraint-
whose pearls are you stealing

  i like that declared holliday mine
as much as anyones the island may be
yours but im hanged if the pacific ocean
is

  tombazis is he right asked mark
turning toward the sea captain who had
seen as many strange things and upon the
sea as he had on the land

  my darling chap replied tombazis
im inclined to think he is

  there now declared holliday i told
you i was within my rights

  i dont remember that you did i
only remember that you were sneaking off
somewhere by yourself and when i came
on you and spoke to you you wouldnt
answer youd just been putting those
things into your mouth out of your hand
because i had holes in both my trouser
pockets

  it doesnt matter a button where you
book magazine



had holes you were morally stealing and
you knew it

  oh morally oned think youd been
talking to old hemingways hes always
gassing about the interests of morality i
suppose-to tombazis-thats why you
brought him up to marry miss leven and
you-in the interests-

  do you want your face smashed in
suddenly roared blazes turning in an in-
stant from a peaceful ship-captain ashore
to a raging pirate

  any time you like but not before la-
dies was hollidays reply

  whats there between the parson and
you asked mark sharply as the cut of
a whip

the blow got home hollidays jaw
went down and he turned a little pale

he could not find an answer mark stared
at him harder over hollidays blunt
high-nosed face there crept by degrees a
flush of dark red

  meantime nydia who had held out her
hand eagerly for the pearls was turning
them over and gloating on them

  where he got these there must be lots
more she said what do you think of
them captain tombazis

  ill run them over by and by replied
blazes just now id like to knock some
of the stuffing out of this beautiful lovely
chap if only you ladies would find an er-
rand somewhere else mark old son its
my go-it is indeed youve had your
chance his face was as red as holli-
days he was breathing hard like a man
who runs clearly it was with difficulty
that he held himself back

  mark gifted with more self-control
looked at him and replied

  you know something more you might
as well tell us

   yes lets hear all the lies jeered hol-
liday who seemed to be recovering from
his momentary fear

  what roared tombazis what did
you mean by taking plummers yassi-
yassi boys on the sly yesterday when ev-
eryone even the parson thought you were
laying off drunk where did you take
them to

  if you know said holliday why do
you ask

  i do know blank dash you you blank
dash i know you took them to the reef-
because you knew we wouldnt make two
visits in a day-and you had them doing

by beatrice grimshaw

skin diving all the afternoon and what
they brought up you opened and you got
those out of them and you meant to go
on at the game on the sly terrorizing the
boys so that they wouldnt-

  how did you find out asked mark
just now-with a bit of lawyer cane
and you talk of terrorizing sneered
holliday

tombazis went on still bellowing like
 a bull

  plummer took you up when you were
broke and brought you here where you
were no good to anyone just out of kind-
ness and gave you shares and you go be-
hind his back and take his- you-i
swear to god ill break every-

  tombazis came marks voice very
even and quiet i want to ask you some-
thing

  what roared blazes turning on
plummer as if he had been the very culprit
himself

  i want to know-as youve done plenty
of pearling-why you think the old jap
left all that bed of rich shell alone when
he seems to have known about it it
seems a bit risky

  how do i know what a beautiful jap
thinks in his lovely mind if he has any
demanded tombazis but he seemed to be
cooling down

  well it looks odd to me i could un-
derstand it when it was only a question of
a cache of shell but now i dont quite-
you dont want to understand any
more than you see the pearls are there
loads of them and hollidays found them
yes and i dont mind telling you said
holliday boastfully that you dont come
in there was only a very little bed there
altogether i ripped one shell open under
water and found a big one and after that
i knew what to do i got the whole lot up
yesterday opened them this morning be-
fore any of you were about and all of them
you dont see in plummers hand-hes
stolen them by the way-are put away
where none of you will get them what
are you all howling about cant a man
use his brains when hes lucky enough to
have them when i was in hospital at
darwin there was a jap in the next bed
who used to talk to his friends when they
came in-never knew i could understand
i was attached to the british legation in
tokio in nineteen five they didnt treat
me decently there so-
the sands of oro

  what did your beautiful jap say

  doesnt matter what he said but i
guessed it wasnt only shell that was up
here and i guessed right who wins the
game now

there was a silence the men looked
at each other in the pandanus above
their heads the leatherneck began again
insanely

  look at yer coat now look at yer
coat now do it youre a regular cock-
olly-co get up

  a movement began it seemed general
at first but by and by it became plain
that everyone was moving except one man
-holliday blazes hands swinging out-
ward at a sailorly angle head well up
was seen detached from the group and
marching smartly away stacy with an
impulse she could not control turned from
the man whose name she bore and made
for the camp with nydia close at hand
mark stayed just a minute he was busy
lighting his eternal pipe he paid no at-
tention at all to holliday while doing it
shortly with the pipe hanging from its
usual corner he followed the women hol-
liday was abandoned

  damn them all he said unemotionally
he had not much nervous voltage to come
and go on at the best the past scene had
worn it out almost indifferently he
stooped and collected the pearls which
some one-perhaps mark perhaps tom-
bazis certainly not nydia-had thrown on
the ground he took a handkerchief out
of his torn pocket tied the gems carefully
in it and carrying them turned off in a
direction opposite to the camp

  it had seemed to stacy the day before
that things could not possibly be worse
than they were she had had to find-as
most people do find who throw down such
a challenge to fate-that things certainly
could be worse by a good deal the eve-
ning that followed on hollidays conviction
was the worst of all he was in an un-
pleasantly exalted mood it was plain that
if the drunkenness of the other day had
been assumed that of the existing moment
was not hemingways too had been
drinking but for him stacy could find ex-
cuse she knew by now that the sudden
fits from which he suffered were commonly
followed by maddening pain and that the
intervals between the fits and the bouts
of agony grew month by month slowly
certainly less

  when they meet and overlap it will be
the conclusion i shall be finally termi-
nated hemingways had said to her with
his ineradicable love for the overpiled
period of the sermon it may be a consid-
erable space of time before that occurs-per-
haps a year or two perhaps somewhat
more in the interim i do my best to
make both ends meet-to keep body and
soul from premature separation life on
any terms is not without certain charms
strange though that may seem in the
present instance

  im quite sure you would like to live
as long as possible we all do had been
stacys trite but comforting reply and
i do think the island is doing you some
good

  thank you-thank you its kind of
you to think about me at all was hem-
ingways reply in his dull eyes there was
the immense loneliness of the man doomed
to wander through the earths dead ends
incredibly far from all that had once meant
home hopelessly out of touch with all the
things among which he was forced forever
to live you dont mind my drinking do
you he asked her plainly i never hide
it i can do a great many undesirable
things but lying is not one of them i
have had some apprehension that your en-
ergetic friend mr plummer who i under-
stand is in charge of the settlement might
object in some practical manner by oblig-
ing me to go

  i dont know whether he would de-
clared stacy but im sure of one thing
that he shant she knew she could man-
age mark so far what did it matter if
this most miserable creature sought the one
miserable refuge open to him

  i am glad that you can answer for
him hemingways had said with some-
thing like a sparkle of amusement in his
half-dead eyes stacy wondered a little
why he was glad it seemed scarcely right
for him to be glad if he thought-and per-
haps he did think-that she and mark-

tonight the wretch was sitting dull
and glassy-eyed on one of the log
seats with his back against a tree while
mark and tombazis played cards and
nydia hovered about restless and dearly
disturbed in mind nydia did not know
what to think of the failure of the expedi-
tion blazes and mark were already
speaking of return seasoned by many a
disappointment they took things calmly
book magazine

-more calmly than she could pretend to
do her money her precious money thus
mark had said that she should have it
back and had brushed away her feeble
scarce half-hearted pretense of wanting to
take her share of the risks and failures
but could they raise it among them this
company of broken men she was by no
means sure she despised them-at least
she tried to despise them having been
brought up in a creed that attached almost
american importance to the necessity of
making good mark might be-was-
the sort of man that almost any woman
would want when she saw him but she was
not so sure that he was the sort of man
a prudent woman would marry when she
got the chance as of course she would-
they had said he owned the devils own
luck she saw no sign of it

  as for tombazis-she did not know
what to think about tombazis her
thoughts fluttered about the reckless sailor
as moths flutter about a lamp she was
still afraid of tombazis she knew he was
not done with

dy and by she saw holliday in the
lamplight leaning over the table and
ostentatiously handling something or other
-it seemed to be one of the small enamel
bowls they used in the kitchen nydia
eternally curious managed to walk behind
him she clapped her hands across her
mouth to keep back a scream the bowl
was full of pearls

  holliday had brought out the whole of
his dishonest gains and was with the worst
possible taste displaying them publicly
under pretense of sorting them he picked
out one from the rest held it up and
looked at it then he dropped it among
the others selected a handful and let them
run through his fingers like rain then
he matched two and compared them all
the time his hands were shaking his eyes
shone drunkenly it was clear he had had
more than was good for his feeble nervous
system a very little made charley holli-
day foolish a little more maudlin and then
violent he was rapidly verging toward
the latter stages having drunk a good deal
just before joining the rest

  look-er this he proclaimed in a loud
tone of voice look-er this lovely pearl
two of em matches by gosh earrings
fit for prinshess can hang m wife all
over with them like a hindoo id-hindoo
isol-and she wont have anything to do

by beatrice grimshaw



with me he shook his head violently
and seemed to be near tears

hthe derelict from his corner looked on
with more interest than one would
have thought possible to anyone in his con-
dition his pale eyes shone as they met
the gems his fingers made clutching mo-
tions it seemed he thought he was han-
dling pearls

  holliday went on with his foolishness
blazes and mark played cards they fin-
ished their game mark produced a pen-
cil and gravely noted down what he owed
tombazis

  that and five pounds by and by to
the back of it tombazis remarked mark
kicked him viciously

  oh you neednt be afraid of shocking
her shes not so beautiful easy to shock-
that one said blazes who seemed rather
irish this night-a sure sign he was in a
good humor

  well you can talk about the bet an-
other time

  whos betting asked holliday loudly
shocking thing betting and gambling
very immoral never do it myself ex-
cept sometimes now wholl bet me ten
pounds ill get ten thousand in t i for
this little lot

  one word had caught hemingways ear
in the intres of morality he began
monotonously in the intres of mrality
i must have half

  the devil you must shouted holli-
day suddenly quarrelsome i said one
fourth not a penny more these are
worth ten thousand- ten twelve
blazes you know pearls come here you
han-you hannel these take em up
look at the size of em twelve thousand
fifteen-twenty look i tell you

  im looking said blazes in rather a
queer voice he had come forward and
taken a few of the largest pearls out of
the bowl his huge red face impended
over holliday like the night signal of a
train the lamps set low on the table
threw lights of henna and shadows of
prussian blue on the heads of holliday
nydia and tombazis on the little gleam-
ing gems that lay like seeds of some magic
fruit within the circle of the bowl

  mark at the far end of the table was
methodically shuffling the cards and put-
ting them together a small wind sud-
denly blew up from the sea it ruffled the
loose cards and shook the lamp-flames to
the sands of oro



the blue

and fro tombazis seemed to be-perhaps
was-grinning something in his looks ar-
rested marks attention he put down the
cards and walked to the end of the table
where holliday was gloating over his bowl
of pearls

  what is it blazes he asked

  there could be no doubt now that tom-
bazis was grinning he held a big pearl
in his hand-a jewel fit for the crown of
a reigning queen he looked at it lifted it
and laid it against his front teeth draw-
ing it lightly backward and forward so
that one heard it scrape then he put it
down on the table and took another-a
third each one he scraped lightly on his
teeth each he laid down apart from the
rest the fourth pearl he took in his hand
looked at it and tossed it away carelessly
to the shadows of the night

iiolliday sprang up with a curse
 tombazis paid not the least attention
to him

  these beautiful pearls he said ad-
dressing plummer stacy and nydia and
to some extent the derelict hemingways
who seemed to have roused himself amaz-
ingly these beautiful pearls are every one
cultured manufactured they call it in
t i-cultured in london but its the
same anywhere theyre made the jap
made them-with the beautiful oyster to
help theres a secret in it that only
these japs know-button pearls almost
anyone can manage but not the round ones
theyre worth-if you market them hon-
estly which some dont-a few shillings
each i reckon the jap meant to fool peo-
ple with them theyre the best ive seen
anyone would buy them for real if he
didnt know enough to rub them against
his teeth as they do in t i 

  scott said mark plummer

 how do you know asked nydia
sharply

  lend me your pearl ring beautiful
lady and ill tell you or dont lend it
do as i did with it now take one of hol-
lidays delightful pearls and do the same
with that eh eh

  its not the same allowed nydia
amazed

  whats the difference

  my ring sticks-clings-just a little
and the other slips

  just so my lady just so thats the
test they use in t i there are people
who have given good money to know it

  do you mean to say demanded hol-
liday in a strangely tamed and lowered
voice that these pearls of mine are manu-
factured

my dear beautiful man said tom-
bazis pleasantly ive known it ever since
you told us about your stealing them
holliday in that sudden state of col-
lapse did not seem able to resent the term

  why he asked feebly wiping his lips
with a dirty handkerchief

  mark put his finger on the weak spot
i didnt choose to allow it just then but
it came home to me next minute my dar-
ling chap why would any beautiful jap
find a bed of pearl-shell simply rotten with
pearls and go off to god knows where
making a memorandum about it and doing
nothing else can you see him i cant
but i tell you what i can see i can see
that beautiful jap-who seems to have
gone farther in the way of cultured pearls
than almost anyone else has done i can
see the chap taking up this island-which
is on the whole pretty handy and yet a
mighty hard one for anyone to get to who
didnt know the reefs-and putting down
his little oyster bed there safe that no one
would find it and choosing just that
finger of the reef that was shut up safe by
the granddaddy of all the octopuses--think
of the two malays and then the lovely
chap went away to let them grow into
beautiful necklaces and he died which was
delightfully hard on him if you ask me
and thats the story my beautiful stealer
of other peoples pearls and were all in
the same basket and delightfully sold but
youre the soldest of all

  captain tombazis demanded nydia
who seemed almost more deeply moved
than anyone will you really tell me that
all those lovely pearls are worth almost
nothing

  i dont say that dear lady if a man
had his wits about him and knew where
to pass them off- but you can be jailed
for it if its found out

tydia heaved a deep long sigh and

	 fixed upon the pearls a look tender re-
gretful infinitely pathetic

  it seems the most frightful pity i ever
heard of in all my life she said

  holliday stupefied with drink and sud-
den disaster was sitting all in a heap star-
ing at the beautiful useless gems as one
hypnotized stacy half hating him al-
together despising him yet felt the old tie
book magazine

between them stir in some degree he had
been hers-he was in misfortune worse
than the trouble that had overthrown him
at siai station she wished that there was
anything she could say to lift him out of
that dead misery men looked so wretched
when things went really wrong

  then in a minute he laid all her kindly
impersonal feeling dead with one stroke

  if i havent got any money after all
he said thickly looking up with red eyes
at stacy ive got my wife still and its
time she knew it stacy-he said
stashy she noted with a shudder of dis-
gust-you and i will get to thursday
island as soon as blazes will take us and
make a fresh start there theres been too
mush-too mush- he did not say what
there had been too much of but he rose
unsteadily to his feet and put a drunken
arm across stacys shoulders

  stacy let out a little cry as of a bird
caught suddenly in a snare mark plum-
mer made one fierce long step forward
and then stopped he stood for a moment
motionless lips set in a hard line eyebrows
bent low over brilliant clever eyes then
he turned and seized the half-sleeping
hemingways by the arm

  wake up he said a jug of water
stood on the table mark seized it and
dashed the contents into hemingways face

  whats between you and that damned
cur he barked as the parson sprang to
his feet choking and struggling

  hemingways fully aroused stared at
holliday who still held the girl in a half-
drunken grasp

  i-he- he began

  he promised you money hes got
none tell it or ill- no tell it man
he hasnt a penny the pearls are bung
blazes says so blazes knows something
too hell make you talk if i dont

  i have been listening- began the par-
son then pulling himself together with
surprising effect he called out to holliday
sir in the interests of morality i must
ask you to treat that lady with respect

  oh youre awake are you said hol-
liday slackening his hold tell it then
tell it and be damned to you you know
i cant buy you now to put another year
into your wretched carcass no you
shant tell it ill tell it myself to keep
you from the pleasure you married me
and that mata girl in the interests of your
cursed morality didnt you in t i four
years ago

by beatrice grimshaw



  i certainly did perform the ceremony of
marriage between you and the native girl
you had led astray by taking her from
her village on a trip to thursday island in
your company i did so because the gov-
ernment of papua visits that offense with
a high fine-removing a native without
permission-and because you had rendered
yourself liable-

  oh curse it you did it because you
knew you could blackmail me for a mar-
riage-fee by threatening to tell

  not so i saved you from the conse-
quences of-

  and you charged five pounds

  i did it in the-

  of course you did in the interests of
the reverend mr hemingways as you al-
ways do well youve done for me now
and not helped yourself very much by
doing it

  may i inform you said the little par-
son turning formally to stacy that your
marriage with this man was not legal-un-
doubtedly not from a legal point of view
indeed it does not exist

  we were never legally married asked
stacy white as the foam on the reef below
her great eyes staring

  certainly not

  then all the time i thought i was his
wife i was his- oh with the inevita-
ble world-old gesture of the woman
wronged she flung her hands before her
burning face and stood a picture of
shame

xjydia that self-conscious and self-val-
  uing maiden looked at her with an ex-
pression that seemed to say which of
us is the better woman now you proud
matron tombazis seeing it and not
much liking it bent over from his big
height to whisper one sentence in her ear
nydia jumped as if she had been shot she
had actually forgotten that aspect of the
matter

  they would-of course they would and
what was to become of her

  nobody was thinking very much of her
in that moment holliday had slipped
away one might without exaggeration
have said that he siunk mark plummer
watching him turned to tombazis and
lifting his pipe out of his mouth said
casually

  you were talking about an end of law-
yer cane this afternoon where did you
leave it
the sands of oro



the blue

  cook-house said tombazis cheerfully
he rubbed his hands together as one well
pleased

  mark without another word went off
into the shadows and stacy saw him no
more that night

  nor did she or tombazis or nydia or
the derelict parson see holliday but next
morning when it became known that hol-
liday was in the separate hut originally
built for mens quarters by himself and
that he was not well enough to get up for
breakfast everyone not excluding the na-
tive cooky-boys knew that mark plum-
mer-and the end of lawyer cane-had seen
charles holliday again

  i suppose said nydia greeting tom-
bazis at breakfast that things have about
done happening by now i think id like
a little quiet for a change

  i think they have done happening my
lady-all but one thing answered the cap-
tain and you know what that is
nydia bridled she thought she knew
but she did not nor did tombazis the
surprises of fate were not yet-quite-at
an end

chapter xviii

in a windy red dawn promising near
 rain stacy found her way down to the
beach she had lain waiting for the light
through interminable hours talk with
nydia was what she could not face just
then she had come very late to bed and
meant to be up and away before the steady
snoring at the opposite side of the hut died
out in snorts gasps and the inevitable
oh-is it time to get up-followed to-
day as it would be if she stayed by some-
thing barbed and insinuatingly scornful
nydia she knew could not forgive her for
attracting mark and she had the means
of revenge well within her grasp now if
she chose to use it stacy was burningly
sensitive about the position in which hol-
lidays selfish and criminal folly had placed
her she felt that she wanted an hour or
two of complete quiet before the begin-
ning of the day to find herself a little and
grow accustomed in some degree to the
changed horizon of her life

  not that she had failed to realize from
the first moment what this freedom must
mean to her and mark but she was like
a sailor escaped from a wreck who has
been battered so long against drowning

seas that he finds himself once ashore
unable to do anything but lie still and take
his breath scarce even thankful to find
himself alive

  the wind in her hair was comforting
cooling after the hot night she stood face
to the east watching the sky redden glo-
riously with the coming of the sun and
thinking as well as she could think after
the bewildering crash of events in the last
few hours about that other morning-it
seemed already long ago-when she and
mark had stood together in the dawn
watching the ship sail in to break their
dream the dream was a dream no longer
some day--not yet-she would be able to
realize that

  the wind was rising it blew her loosely
coiled hair in long waves away from her
face it flung her white short dress out
backward she looked in her long stock-
ings and arched little shoes like some new-
fashioned figurehead for a new sort of ship
-not classic but twentieth century in
every line yet as she stood an inspiration
for a sculptor

  you look as if you ought to be on the
bow of something was mark plummers
comment as he came up behind her walk-
ing rustlingly through the sea-grass that
lined the beach

  she had known he would come she had
had the space of quiet that she wanted
now she was steady and could face the
great hour of her life

  well was all mark plummer found to
say but he made his eyes speak for him
-those splendid gray-blue eyes that so
many women had desired that had through

all the years kept their best for her

mark had loved and gone away more than
once more than ten times but he had
never looked at any woman as he looked at
stacy now

che could not have told afterward which
 of them it was who kissed the other
first the leathernecks might have told-
they sat close by in the tops of the nearest
palm trees having the morning hate for
which a leatherneck is chiefly distinguished
and seemed in the intervals of mutual
commination to be watching the two hu-
mans with malicious interest yet there
was nothing gratifying to a leatherneck in
the sight of two people who stood with
their arms about one another minute after
minute saying silly things they could so
much better have stood a little apart and
book magazine	by beatrice grimshaw



exchanged recriminations-like the small
people with the necks of leather and lungs
of cast iron who sat aloft and cursed in the
tops of the palms

  when are we going to be married was
marks first question

  ive got to be unmarried first an-
swered stacy drawing apart from him
do let me alone mark and let me think
you-you bewilder me

  im very simple all the same i know
exactly what i want stated mark loos-
ening the long hold he had kept of this
loved woman and looking as if he purposed
to resume it very soon

  i wonder said stacy suddenly turn-
ing white if we were right to believe all
charley and that man said theres no
proof but their word

  make your mind easy holliday was
speaking truth he was fairly candid-
after

  what did you- began stacy but
she saw the shut-up look she already be-
gan to know coming over marks face
she changed her sentence when mark did
not want to tell you anything-

  how can you check it was what she
said

  easy enough go down to t i and
take a copy of the register and by the
way you might as well know that he isnt
quite the stage villain he appears to be
bad enough but-he thought the first
marriage wasnt legal indeed he didnt
mean it to be

 how

  well you know the papuan laws-he
was liable to get into a row for taking the
girl out of the country but not if he was
married to her so he thought hed do
what thieves call the double cross hem-
ingways had got at him and was more or
less blackmailing him and the resident
had heard of it and threatened to report
him to the lieutenant-governor of papua
and the girl herself was trying to make a
deal of it he thought he saw his way out
by giving a flse name to everyone-since
he wasnt known-and marrying mata as
james brown its a very common delu-
sion by the way-that marrying under a
false name makes the marriage illegal of
course it doesnt i will say this much for
the cow he did not mean to commit big-
amy he meant to do all right by you it
was a big shock to him i reckon when
hemingways got at him and told him how
things were

  would hemingways have kept quiet if
--charley-had had the means to pay
him

  who knows thank heaven he didnt

  thank heaven echoed stacy i
cant realize it all mark ive dreamed it
so often i cant think its true this time
really

  i could help you to realize it sug-
gested mark twisting his mustache his
arm stealing again toward her waist i
find i can realize it quite well my-
damn

the parson was standing beside them

	neither had heard him come but he
was there black-clad stooping red-cyed a
blot upon the beauty of the scene

  how long have you been here might i
ask demanded mark sharply

  i have only just come replied hem-
ingways i spent a disturbed night the
old enemy-the old enemy

  you mean whisky suggested mark

  dont be so hard on him whispered
stacy he cant help it

  i mean the physical disability from
which i suffer-the thorn in the flesh-
ah he paused a moment i hope youll
have a pleasanter way of exit when your
time comes both of you

  i must say youre a cheerful sort of
beggar

  we have all got to die and meantime
we have got to live which brings me
to the point

  i thought we were heading toward
that

  you know my dear mr plummer and
my good mrs holliday-i give you the
title as a matter of courtesy it is not justly
due because my marriages are sound mar-
riages and they always hold no one has
ever- i think i wander a little what i
meant to say was that i have always tried
to act in the interests of-

  yes i know

  so to come briefly but effectively to
the point i am quite prepared to marry
you at any time you may wish his
dead eyes glowed he looked like a fisher-
man who in the clear waters at his feet
has spied his fish and hopes for an imme-
diate bite

  mark tall personable looked down at
him with a half-smile and kept on twisting
his mustache

  it doesnt sound such a bad- he
began
the sands of oro

  id do it cheaply interrupted heming-
ways with sudden eagerness id do it
for- he paused briefly eying the two
with a horse-buying sort of look four
pounds he ended

  mark was opening his lips but it was
stacy who interrupted now

  i never heard such nonsense she said
crisply as if i would be married in any
such way we should have to look things
up-and see that everything was all right
and-and get some clothes perhaps any-
way its not to be thought of

i iemingways fingered his chin disap-

	pointed

  if its holliday stands in the way he
said -i understand mr plummer settled
with him that hes not to stop and run the
risk of being charged with bigamy on ac-
count of the scandal hes to go away to
africa or somewhere and send an account
of his death to the papers

  mark is that true demanded stacy
quite replied mark calmly i
thought it the best way for everyone con-
cerned

  then that settles it of course you
will have to marry me as a widow i only
hope nydia will keep from talking

  i dare say tombazis will manage that
tombazis likes you quite a little observed
mark pulling a long stem of grass between
his hands he was very matter of fact
now you would never have supposed that
the leathernecks only five minutes earlier
had seen and heard all that theyd seen and
heard

  is she going to marry him

  probably i know blazes

  it might be as well to go and discuss
the matter with one or other said hem-
ingways thoughtfully by the way he
added over his shoulder if you should
happen to be in thursday island or the
neighborhood when the happy event
occurs may i ask that you will-

  you may answered mark pleasantly
and i may answer that ill see you
damned first

  mark remonstrated stacy as the
derelict rustled away through the long
grass-which strangely enough had given
no such notice of his arrival as now it gave
of his departure-mark

  thats my name  mrs mark
plummer-i think it doesnt sound badly
do you think i would give that rat the
job more likely sydney cathedral and

the blue



a bishop assisted by some one or other
unless of course- he did not finish

  impossible said stacy with decision
mark-do you know were going to be
very poor

  plummer seemed to wince a little

   i do know it when i let myself think
he answered then i realize that i ought
to be kicked for letting you take up with
me i havent even a present for you
ive got one for you allowed stacy
beginning to blush

  what the little thingummy you always
wear and wont let me see

  its my luck-and yours i cant help
being superstitious about it i couldnt
show it to you before but i promised my-
self if ever-i promised you should have
it then she was fumbling inside her
blouse a long gold chain came forth
from its end she detached a little shining
heart and laid it in plummers ready palm
isnt it wonderful she breathed

plummer stood absolutely motionless
  staring at the heart

  my god he said where did you
get this he lifted it to his lips and
stacy thought he was going to kiss it in-
stead he bit it hard

  do you-do you know what it is he
asked her and stacy for the first time saw
her man of iron shaken marks hands
were actually trembling

   its a heart

  its a nugget-gold

  gold

  yes where did it come from

  the creek stacy was woman enough
to feel a little disappointed at the recep-
tion her gift had met with not quite thus
had she pictured the tender scene

  the creek will somebody kick me
-hard

   is there likely to be more gold there
without answering her question mark
put both arms around her gave her a
tender but almost hasty kiss and started
walking five miles an hour for the cook-
house

   tell them he called over his shoulder
to expect me when they see me

  stacy reached the cook-house riot long
after him but he was gone

  taubada explained the cooky him
takem one basin him taken one fick
pick him go long creek what name i
makem breakfass tooday hamanegg i
make tausage i make

it was ten oclock-a long space of time
 for stacy-before mark came back to
the camp he came covered with mud
wet through tired and hungry but with
the light of victory on his face-and
another light as well that she was to know
many times in the years long after that
she did not yet know as the flush of that
most formidable of fevers-gold-fever

  ive got it he informed the assembled
camp

  what have you got asked tombazis
leaning back lazily against a palm trunk
and smoking a long cigar

  ive got the most promising gold-field
ive seen since the yodda broke out

  what tombazis hemingways and
nydia all screamed out the word together
all jumped to their feet at once no one
doubted mark he was known all over
papua as the surest prospector in the ter-
ritory

  ive been the biggest idiot-comes of
meddling with something else than your
own business if id just stuck to pros-
pecting what i understood- well we have
it anyhow and it wasnt me who found
it it was-he hesitated for the fraction
of a second over the name he did not
fancy using the hateful married-unmarried
holliday or the maiden name that was
more or less an insult it was stacy found
it he finished boldly and in that word
nydia of the golden hair saw her hopes
forever go down

  characteristically she reached for con-
solation to the next best thing how
much share have i she demanded on the
spot

  one-fourth answered mark

  and stacy has the same

  stacy and i have half you have a
fourth blazes has another its going to
be a real good thing of course my own-
ing the island doesnt prevent anyone
coming here to take the gold-

  oh-how unjust came from nydia

  not at all thats law but we can
pretty well clean it out before anyone gets
on to it stacy girl you never spoke a
truer word than when you said the little
heart was our luck

there was perhaps a touch of pain in
another and a warmer heart of gold at
plummers words perhaps in that min-
ute stacy saw far ahead the years when
gold and she were to struggle against each

the

other for home peace stable position all
that a woman loves besides love itself per-
haps she saw in a prophetic flach just
what a woman must pay in just how many
pieces coined of her own hearts blood for
the love of a pioneer

   if so she lifted the burden as once she
had lifted another but this time it was
with pride

  hemingways obsessed by his one idea
had been slyly watching nydia and tom-
bazis he had seen how the eyes of the
big man turned toward her how she with
the talk of gold and of shares kept looking
oftener and oftener at him the iron to
his mind was hot he struck

  i hope he said with a ghost of his
old lost society manner i may have the
pleasure of shortly marrying you the
words were distributed judiciously he felt
between the two

  it was tombazis who answered him

  very soon he said in about half
an hour give the lady time to do her
hair

jydia let forth one of her little screams

	 my hair doesnt want doing and im
not going to be married she said there
was the least possible weakening in her
tone

  a ladys hair always wants doing as-
serted tombazis but if youve any
doubts- he leaned forward in a mo-
ment nydias dress down to the knees
was hidden by a cataract of gold

  how dare you she asked feebly

  i can do what i like with my own
property said blazes coolly out of his
eyes there looked for a moment the spirit
that had changed his name among men to
the fiery title he bore stacy at such a
look would have risen and shaken off any
chain by which he held her nydia seeing
it cringed and was almost pleased to
cringe

   ill go and tidy my hair she said

  put on your best dress at the same
time counseled tombazis make your-
self look very nice its your wedding day
remember

  and nydia down at last said only
yes and went

  it will be five pounds said heming-
ways quickly

  ask mr mark plummer for the five
answered tombazis in a lordly manner
he owes it to me

dull it may have started that way but a couple of
young riots occurred before it was over an excellent story

mood furnishes the spectacles
through which we view the world
and a thousand different factors
combine to furnish our moods health is
one its bearing is too plain to need illus-
tration experience is another the storm
which a sailor dismisses as a capful of wind
gives the new voyaging landsman thrills
that will last a lifetime the condition of
the stomach is still another the short tem-
per of a hungry man and the complaisance
of a well-fed one are the two fixed points
in domestic diplomacy in general any-
thing that makes a man satisfied with him-
self makes him easy to suit with the world
anything that depresses his vitality or
wounds his self-love causes him to view
the universe with a jaundiced eye and
mourn that times are out of joint

  now important as is this truth with an
adult it is ten times more so with a boy
pope being an old bachelor said that a
child is pleased with a rattle and tickled
with a straw sometimes that is true and
at other times the same child cannot be

pleased with a calliope or tickled with a
church-steeple it all depends on how he
feels in the right humor he can find thrill-
ing drama in sailing a raft across a four-
foot puddle if hungry or tired if his
internals are complaining or if something
has happened to make him think the world
is treating him unfairly he can fall over a
dozen melodramas without seeing them or
sit with bored indifference while fate stages
a spell of hysterics that would tear his
fathers nerves to ribbons and when two
boys of the same age and both in this mood
of disillusionment get their heads together
they might as well be left to sleep it off
they cannot be spanked or scolded out of it

cteve hrdlicka shuffled downstairs
from the parental flat one fine morning
in the summer of  in a mood of large
disgust with the world the planet in his
eyes had become a flat stale and unprofit-
able place of habitation item one after
too heroic abstinence from sugar for the
sake of the soldiers steve had succumbed
a dull day



by george l knapp

to temptation the night before and filled
up on indigestible stuff misnamed candy
acquired in three-cent lots at the maxwell
street market he was paying for his sins
with a dull discomfort in his middle region
a dark brown taste in his mouth and an
uneasy feeling at the back of his head that
it served him right not for worlds would
he have admitted this however since other
events made it clear that the earth was in
a conspiracy against him for weeks he
had been practicing one of the solo parts in
a projected childrens concert the day be-
fore item two he was sent back to the
chorus and the solo was given to morris
shapiro for no better reason than that
young morris was the better singer steve
could have made morris ineligible for pub-
lic appearance in about thirty seconds but
the director had taken canny precautions
against such action if anything happened
to morris steve should not sing at all-
which was item three what chance had
a kid in a place where things were run like
that manifestly none

  he started listlessly for the grocery half
a block away to get bread and cereal the
place was full of other breakfast shoppers
and while waiting his turn steve saw an
acquaintance aleck ralli aleck was in
the dumps likewise though his gloom was
a shade less leaden

  hello steve he said

  hello

  what you after

  chow

  som i the conversation fainted
there but after a space steve revived it
with a question

  where you stayin alecks mother
was dead

  mrs santos its fierce she bosses 
me all the time

  steve gave a grunt that seemed to say
anyone could guess that aleck got his
packages and went out steve obtained
his bread laid it on the counter while wait-
ing for the cereal and then carried the lat-
ter away alone he did not discover his
loss till it was called to his attention at
home with sundry comments in czech and
english on boys who walked in their sleep
he went back protestingly retrieved the
bread returned and ate a sullen breakfast
at the close of the meal he was told that
for some hours to come he must mind the
baby

  steve was by many years the youngest
of his direct family the baby was his

nephew son of an older brother then en
route to france whose wife was living with
steves parents during her husbands ab-
sence minding the baby is not a favorite
sport among boys of ten or eleven but
steve was both fond and proud of his
young kinsman and on ordinary occasions
for a brief time really liked playing with
him this occasion was not ordinary but
it had to be endured and he would not take
out his spite on the youngster casting
about for some way to make the task less
boresome steve saw his pushmobile and
a scheme was born

a n empty soapbox was lying in the yard

    steve annexed that and nailed it on the
pushmobile martin watched the process
with interest steve now went exploring in
the basement and came back with a piece
of frayed clothesline which he tied to the
pushmobile back he went to the base-
ment again the baby holding by his
breeches-leg and got some boards these
he laid on the steps leading from the yard
to the basement forming a run-plank or
inclined plane then he lifted his nephew
into the box and put the pushmobile on the
run-plank

  heres where we shoot the chutes mar-
tin said steve almost good-humored from
the tonic of doing something for somebody

  he let the pushmobile run down the
slope holding by the rope to prevent too
vapid progress martin voiced loud ap-
proval steve hauled him back and gave
him another trip-then another and an-
other he was hauling back the car for
perhaps the tenth time when the rope
broke the pushmobile went whizzing down
the short runway tipped over at the bot-
tom and spilled martin out on the hard
cement

  the yells woke the neighborhood and be-
fore steve could rescue or pacify the baby
fully twenty persons were in the yard or
were looking into it from their windows
in the van of the arrivals was martins
mother frightened and furious though she
did no scolding save to ask steve if he
wanted to kill the child the question did
not seem to require an answer martin was
carried away still weeping while the other
visitors laughed at steve and guyed his in-
vention till he flung the offending contriv-
ance into a corner of the basement and
escaped out to the street the cloud that
had begun to lift shut down on him once
more thicker and darker than ever
a dull day



lie glared up and down the street look-
ing for trouble he could lick anyone
of his age within a radius of four blocks
and had proved it too thoroughly to have
his prowess disputed there were some-
what larger lads however who could give
him a run for his money and a fight with
one of these might have worked off his
spleen but before any such saving chance
could befall he met the director of the
coming concert and was sent to deliver
some music a few miles farther west

  go on the elevated said the director
handing him some money ill call her up
and tell her youre coming

  all right said steve as if earning a
quarter by an hours easy trip were a trial
to be borne rather than a chance to be
seized

  he was lucky enough to get a seat by
the window facing backward but the car
filled up quickly and when it left the next
station all seats were taken the woman
who had been sitting by him got up he did
not know why and then he heard a heavy
voice

  hey moof ofer

  steve looked up at a big man whose
boundary lines were all convex curves his
cheeks bulged out from the bones of his
face his neck bulged over his collar his
front elevation from throat to waistband
was a study in progressive protuberance

he had a short clipped gray beard and his
gray hair cut straight across and standing
up stiffly made steve class him at once as
an enemy alien

  veil moof ofer repeated the new-
comer dropping into the vacant space and
shoving the lad aside by the mere breadth
of his base of operations

  it would have been a tight fit at best
but the man was deliberately making it
tighter he wanted to make some one un-
comfortable and though a kid was poor
satisfaction it was better than none steve
squirmed and scowtled and the enemy alien
glared at him

  vots der matter he demanded

  youre taking up all the seat retorted
steve

  veil if you dond lig id ged oud re-
turned the other rudely

  steve knew-by experience-exactly what
to do in such cases provided conditions
were right first get up in a weary dis-
couraged way but stand close then as
the car slows for a stop soak the offending
adult on the nose and bolt but these tac-

the blue

tics tried and tested though they be can
be used only on a surface car since they
require a clear aisle and an open door
this aisle was not clear and the guard
not occupied like a street-car conductor
with collecting fares would be sure to in-
tervene steve sighed and was about to
yield to his fate when he noticed a strap-
hanger near by

che was a negress of a deep chocolate-
 brown color and a physique that a coal-
heaver might envy not much below six
feet in height and of ample breadth and
thickness her plenteous fat was laid on a
frame big enough to carry it with dignity
under one arm she held a bundle the
other hand alternately clutched a strap and
wiped sweat from her shining countenance
and she grinned pleasantly at steve as she
caught his upturned eye steve grinned
back and rising with the best movie-hero
manner that he could muster offered the
colored lady his seat she started to re-
fuse grasped the situation and her grin
broadened

   much bliged lil boy  she said ah
suah tell de worl yous been mighty well
raised much bliged and she sat down
with the persuasive finality of a pile-
driver

  hey vot you doin cried the other
occupant of the seat the colored lady
looked around as if she had not known he
was there

   scuse me mister she said ah
didnt mean to set down in yo lap jess
wait till ah gets fixed right

  she wriggled a few times crushing him
tighter and tighter one side of his ample
paunch was squeezed against the window-
sill-he had taken possession of that two-
thirds of the seat when steve rose-and
the colored ladys elbow indented the
other side the irate unfortunate felt as
if he had been inveigled into a hay-press
the chocolate amazon spoke again

   pears to me yo takes up a powful
lot o room white man she remarked is
yo paid two fares

  the only answer was a throaty growl
the colored lady went on

  ef ah wras in yo place white man
ahd ship myself by freight an have a
truck waitin fo me tother end of de line
yessuh dats what ahd do taint safe
fo yo to ride on no elevated yous liable
to bust de timbers yo wants to git right
down nest to de groun an stay dere
book magazine

  her voice though pleasant and musical
had the carrying quality of a steam whistle
the whole car was enjoying the fun and
testifying to its pleasure by unblushing
laughter the fat man was fairly frothing
with rage but in the face of a verbal at-
tack of this sort he was inarticulate his
tormentress took a new tack

  say fat man she demanded how
much food is yo done saved to help win
de wah

  there was no answer though the big
mans mouth opened and closed like that
of a newly landed fish steve was almost
happy the next station was his land-
ing-place and he moved toward the door
the colored ladys voice rang out again

  look heah white man ah begins to
have a spicion yo aint patriotic is yo
a spy

the car shrieked and the teuton un-
able to stand the chaff any longer tried
to struggle to his feet the train stopped
and the guard threw open the gates several
passengers were leaving steve hung back
as long as possible to watch the fun the
german pulled himself free at last and
made for the door shaking his fist at the
grinning boy steve already hurrying out
put the thumb of scorn to the nose of de-
rision and twiddled his fingers but alas
he could not do this and watch his step
a lady was entering the car holding a
parasol thrust out before her with one hand
and leading a spoiled and overdressed little
girl with the other steve tripped on the
parasol and fell sprawling just as the car
went into another gale of laughter at the
fat man

  oh what a silly boy exclaimed the
beribboned angel child hear them laugh
at him mamma isnt he silly she
added her shrill squeal to the mirth steve
had gained his feet like a cat but the pride
and pleasure of baiting the fat teuton had
vanished he slunk down the stairs mut-
tering savagely to himself

  darn fool girl i hate girls always
giggling darn old umbrella

  he looked so woebegone that when he
delivered the music the recipient tipped
him a nickel out of sheer sympathy steve
accepted the coin but it did not cheer him
a drugstore was near by and he thought
for a moment of getting an ice-cream
cone but gave over the project his in-
teriors did not seem to call for extra nour-
ishment he boarded a street-car not

by george l knapp



noticing that it was one which turned north
four blocks from his home instead of pass-
ing the nearest corner he discovered his
mistake only after being carried a block in
the wrong direction and the mishap added
to his grudge against the universe

  wisht i was in the army he muttered
to himself

  a little farther on he encountered aleck
ralli again the italian boy was shuffling
along more dejectedly than ever and as
he looked up the reason for his added
gloom was plain to see one eye had
been decorated by an unfriendly but force-
ful hand steve registered mild interest
who give you that shiner he asked
jim prevalsky ill get even with him
one of these days ill lay for him

  hes too big for you ill lick him for
you sometime

  i know where he is said aleck hope-
fully

  i dont want to now said steve
too hot

  a grown-up stranger would have thought
the boy was dodging the combat but that
was not the case steve felt sure of his
ability to lick jim prevalsky did lick him
a week later but was too bored and world-
weary to be bothered with the job just
now aleck understood and sighed they
walked a little farther and then both boys
sat down on the curb bare feet in the
street living picture of juvenile ennui

  aint it fierce said aleck

  yep said steve without asking about
the antecedents of the pronoun every-
thing was fierce

a honk interrupted their forlorn medi-
tations and they jerked their feet away
barely in time as a flivver truck dashed up
to the curb at a hot pace and stopped with
a protesting rattle and squeal

  say you red-headed crap-shooter where
do you think youre goin with that dish-
pan band demanded steve startled into
a momentary interest the carrot-topped
youth of eighteen who climbed down from
the drivers seat turned on the boys sourly

  shut your trap an keep your feet outa
the streets he ordered

  you go chase yourself you organ-grind-
ers monkey returned steve you
couldnt drive a junk-wagon

  the young man started forward threat-
eningly and steve sidestepped toward a
fruit-stand where some extra spiny pine-
apples were displayed for sale but noth-
a dull day

ing happened the red-haired youth halted
in the middle of a stride and turned away
with an air of elaborate unconcern glanc-
ing over his shoulder to see what had oc-
casioned this change of heart steve spied
an approaching blue uniform

  oh rats he exclaimed disgustedly

  somebodys always takin the joy outa
life quoted aleck

  damn the kaiser added steve list-
lessly

  wisht i was big enough to go into the
army said aleck as they wandered on

  no good returned steve forgetting
that he had wished the same thing half an
hour before the kaiserll quit soons
our boys get goin good

it was noon when they reached the hrd-

	licka flat and at steves invitation aleck
came up to dinner the meal over and a
few chores performed both boys went down
to the street again after some aimless
wandering they stopped at an alley by
mutual consent morris shapiro lived in
a flat whose yard backed up on that alley

  goin after him asked aleck who
knew the story

  steve shook his head but turned down
the peddlers thoroughfare aleck following
morris was in the yard with half a dozen
other lads he saw his rival coming and
knowing that he had not a ghost of a
chance in physical combat resorted to the
quick placating diplomacy of his race

  hello steve he called cordially
come in hello aleck

  aleck answered steve did not but both
boys entered the yard the very presence
of them brought gloom one lad already
there gave his vote on some proposed play

  aw shucks that aint no good he said

  well then what you want demanded
morris here lets leave it to steve
what you want to play steve

  nothin said steve there was silence
for a moment and then some one made the
inevitable suggestion

  lets play injuns

  none of them ever had seen an indian
save those belonging to the cigar-store
tribe but the movie has done more to re-
popularize the more or less noble red man
than j fenimore cooper ever accomplished
there was a general chorus of approval

  in a few moments parts were assigned
to all steve was chief on morris nomina-
tion and morris was prisoner-on steves
morris accepted the post readily enough

the blue



he was determined to be thorough in placat-
ing so dangerous a rival and did not real-
ize all the implications of his role en-
lightenment came in a hurry

  thats good said steve well tie
you to the stake an burn you

  morris entered instant objection declar-
ing among other things that his mother
would not want him cooked steve dis-
missed such trifles with a wave of the hand

   taint real he said in vast contempt
and youll be hero

  that decided it morris remembered a
movie that chronicled the adventures of
sure-shot sam the scalping scout of the
sierras in sixty-seven blood curdling epi-
sodes he consented to be the scalping
scout the next problem was the choice
of a place steve insisted on real fire and
obviously a performance of that sort in
the back yard would attract the attention
of some meddlesome adult

  theres the basement suggested some
one

they adjourned to the basement it had
a cement floor and several wooden
posts which helped hold up the beams of
the flat morris was tied to one of these
posts some boxes were broken to pieces
and the fuel placed around him-at a little
distance for no one really wanted to hurt
the boy though no one realized how readily
box splinters blaze up steve struck a
match and lighted the heap and then the
band of red men began to dance around
their victim uttering terrifying yowls the
busy adults above and around paid no
attention they were used to yowling
then came a crash in the alley and the
chorus in the basement stopped

  bet its a bomb exclaimed one boy
and all of them ran out

  hey cried morris come back an
tie me loose

  no one paid attention the boys reached
the alley and found a couple of delivery
autos which had locked mudguards as they
tried to pass the drivers were arguing
the matter fist to fist but the combat was
unequal and short the noble red men
waited hopefully for further excitement
when they heard a terrified screech

  help fire murder im burning
he-e-elp 

  it was morris and the smoke coming
out of the basement showed that there was
reason for his fright the lads rushed
back steve ahead but even as they
book magazine



crowded into the area way a clawing rag-
ing she-thing plunged through them knock-
ing them right and left as a liner might
knock a fleet of rowboats caught up a pail
of water emptied it over the blaze that was
singeing morris legs dropped on her knees
to inspect her offspring and then find-
ing him really unhurt mrs shapiro arose
and spoke

  her remarks came in a torrent that left
the small culprits gasping and stunned
after a bit realizing that most of the boys
did not understand a word that she was
saying mrs shapiro switched to what she
believed to be english the change slack-
ened her speed though she still made some
hundreds of revolutions per minute but she
got over the footlights she did not call the
boys indians perhaps from an instinctive
feeling that they would like it but that
was the only term she spared them

  loafers no-counts worthless nix-nux
lazybones boches bulgars cossacks po-
grommers kannubbles who wanted to roast
poor morris alive and eat him-these were
merely the high spots in the oration as
she felt herself running out of epithets
mrs shapiro began to punctuate her re-
marks with swats delivered by a far from
feeble hand and the boys hemmed in by
a circle of sympathizing neighbors could
do little but crouch and dodge morris
pleaded in vain with his irate parent she
kept at her task till the boys broke through
the ring and scattered like a covey of quail
aleck and steve stopped breathless a
block away the latters nose was bleed-
ing and the italian boys damaged eye on
one side was balanced by a scratched cheek
on the other

  aint it fierce asked aleck again and
again steve assented without asking ques-
tions the whole world was fierce

i ie bethought him of the quarter received
 for the mornings errand-that it had
remained unspent so long was sufficient
evidence of his distress of mind and the
two adjourned to a near-by shop for some
strawberry ice-cream cones the color of
the cream seemed to show that american
chemists were making progress in matching
german dyes and when a drop of the
melting stuff fell on alecks hand it left a
bright scarlet stain he contemplated it
in some doubt

  spose its poison he asked

  mebbe returned steve and went on
eating what did a little poison matter to

by george l knapp

one wnose young life was blighted any-
way aleck stared and then not to be
outdone went on eating too

  they finished their cones stood up felt
nothing worse than a vague heaviness and
sourness under their waistbands and wan-
dered on an hours aimless sauntering
brought them to one of the little west
side parks there is a shallow lagoon in
this park and just now twenty or thirty
children were wading and splashing around
therein mostly with underwear for bathing
suits as aleck and steve looked on wist-
fully a group of their friends joined them

  why dont you go in asked one of
these boys

  no bathing suit answered steve

  do like me said the other lad patting
his soggy union suit which gaped and
yawned at all the important sectors but
furnished protection from police interfer-
ence

  dont want to answered steve-which
was rank evasion he had no underclothes
he never wore them in hot weather unless
his mother personally saw to it that he put
them on she had overlooked that cere-
mony this morning and the union suit was
tucked away under steves mattress

  well why dont you go in without a
suit demanded the older boy

   taint allowed said steve

  a heap you care about that retorted
the other who knew steves supreme con-
tempt for regulations that ran counter to
his wishes youre scared thats all

  i aint neither

  you are too

  steve ran his eyes rapidly over the pool
all the bathers in sight were boys he did
not like the adventure being thrust upon
him but he hated to appear afraid and
what difference did a suit of underclothes
make anyway among a bunch of kids

  you dont dast repeated his tormen-
tor

  i dast too

  prove it then you can peel off by
them bushes you dont dast youre a
fraid cat steves scared he began to
intone backing away for he well knew
the most probable retort to such a taunt
but neither steves mind nor his fists were
as nimble as usual that afternoon

  i aint scared he retorted you
watch

a number of adults were sitting or
lying around the pool but a clump of
bushes some thirty feet from the bank was
a dull day



by george l knapp

reasonably secluded steve retired thither
a screen of other lads around him and
doffed his hat shirt and breeches then
outwardly blustering but with his heart in
his mouth he charged like a white streak
across the open space and into the pool

  for a full minute no one noticed him
which seems to show that the japanese are
right and that we western folk see im-
propriety in such cases because we are
eternally looking for it then the boy
who had taunted steve into the exploit
gave tongue

  o-o-o-o-e-ee lookut steves nakud 
all eyes turned toward the pool and in
the pool all eyes turned toward steve he
stopped embarrassed and furious and
with common accord the youngsters in the
water raised voice and hand against him
he had broken the customs of the pack
and he seemed afraid therefore by ancient
law he was fair game

  ai yow nakud they yelled sha-a-
a-ame they came toward him splash-
ing water and throwing the twigs and small
sticks floating on the surface while two
in the shallower parts clawed up handfuls
of mud from the bottom and flung them
the spat of these missiles changed steves
embarrassment to anger and he counter-
attacked at once two of the pack went
down from his blows and pushes and the
rest gave back but then came a diversion
the racket had roused a drowsing blue-
coat and a bull-like voice bawled out
hey there ye young scut come outa
that quick

  it would have been better for steve had
he obeyed the policeman had boys of his
own and would have counted a fatherly
tongue-lashing ample punishment for such
an offense but steve was too furious and
too startled to act sensibly he whirled
instead and raced through the shallow
water toward the side where his clothes
lay and instantly the pack was splashing
at his heels while the cop active in spite
of his weight and with the advantage of
solid footing ran round the bank to head
off the culprit he succeeded but steve
turned and flailed his way through his pur-
suers there were women on the opposite
bank but in his extremity the boy did not
care for he counted them negligible as
obstacles it was a fatal mistake he out-
paced the officer but as he left the water
a womans hand clutched his arm he
twisted free staggered and plunged head
foremost into the folds of a skirt whose
wearer was a person of weight and sub-

stance not to be thrust aside by any lad
of steves years

  ive got him she shouted it was a
needless remark she was holding steves
head between her knees and applying a
practiced hand where it would do the most
good the policeman ran up panting

  give him wan for me mrs shane
he exclaimed mrs shane finished her
massage and the cop took a firm grip on
steves arm

  aint ye shamed o yerself he de-
manded jerking the boy upright there
was a twinkle in his eye and he winked
at his female helper over the culprits head
tearin in here like a wild injun searin
the women an children half to death-
particularly the women  he winked again
and mrs shane chuckled come on
now he ordered

i ie superintended steves dressing and

	a ordered him out of the park on pain
of immediate commitment to jail then
turned back to the pool

  aint he the fine young fightin divil 
he exclaimed i fair love a kid like that
twas that lump o sin mike miller put
him up to it i expect-dared him most
likely sure if i find him knockin mikes
block off ill be blind in wan eye and un-
able to see outa the other

  but steve did not know that those who
had punished his conduct approved his
character nor was he able to find his
tempter the same lump o sin that the wise
cop had named mike had judged it best
to vanish aleck had waited and with
this faithful retainer steve watched and
hunted for hours but to no avail then
came an unrelished supper and then beg-
ging seven cents to enable him to stand
treat steve took his henchman to a ten-
cent movie for an hour they forgot their
troubles while following a deep dark des-
perate melodrama of spies and secret-serv-
ice heroes but then they had to return
to the street and drab reality once more

  as they came to the corner where they
must separate for the night a phonograph
which had been declaring that it wouldnt
go home till something was over over
there changed suddenly to the end of a
perfect day but the boys did not notice
the irony they were feeling a shade bet-
ter than at some periods through the day
but they did not know it steve yawned

  gee  he said i wisht we lived where
somethin happened

  so do i said aleck well g night
fifty cans of opium

         a quaint little episode which has to do with murder
         and sudden death and smuggled opium and a white
         man who ventures a battle of wits with a chinese

by dris deming

chongs slant eyes narrowed as he
studied the white man who faced
him across the teakwood table in the
orientals sumptuous quarters chong kee
ex-gunman smuggler dealer in opium and
slave-girls had many reasons to hate-and
fear-the police

  its a cinch chong argued cartwright
this guy doesnt know chinatown and
hes asked me to put him hep to some mud
hes got five thou to invest see he fig-
ures on going up the river and making a
clean-up

  fi tousan dolla repeated chong in
his harsh clipped english too much
one hunna dolla-one can fibty cans
no can do

  cartwrights unshaven jaw went out ag-
gressively his small eyes flashed

  dont give me any of that no can do
talk you can do it and you will now
you sit pretty and listen to me

  ill tell pattison how to get to your
place ill give him a card so youll know
its o k you show him the fifty cans
let him test em-if he knows that much

then when he pays over the coin and
leaves with the hop you go to that window
and give me the high sign savvy

  chong grunted but held silent

  ill be down in the alley with minard
my side-kick went on cartwright min-
ard will tail pattison until he gets far
enough away from your joint that he wont
suspect you are in the deal then hell
flash his buzzer and grab him

  minard will claim to be a federal pro-
hibition agent he will call pattison by
some other name and accuse him of having
liquor in the suitcase about that time
pattison will be wishing it was liquor-any-
thing but opium see hell be so scared
of going to the pen hell drop the suitcase
and beat it

  theres where the fine-work comes in
minard will pretend to chase pattison but
of course he cant go far lugging that suit-
case of opium when he is sure pattison is
out of the neighborhood minard will con-
nect with me and ill bring all your opium
right back to you get it

  in return you give me four thousand of


fifty cans of opium



the blue

the money pattison pays you you make
a thousand cleav me and minard split the
rest what say

  ghongs yellow face was as expressionless
as a stone

  you still in plice depatment he in-
quired casually

  sure but dont let that bother you i
aint framin anything-on you

  chong took a chinese cigarette from a
pocket of his blouse lighted it with a steady
hand

  a right he concluded without enthu-
siasm pattison come leben oclock i
have opum leddy pattison pay fi tousan
dolla he take my opum you bling my
opum back i kip one tousan gib you
fo tousan a right i sabby

  cartwright arose he tossed his ciga-
rette-stub into the sand and ash of a huge
brass censer that stood on the floor by the
desk

  one thing more chong how will you
signal me when the deal is over come to
think of it youd better not show up at
that window

  the chinamans narrowed eyes darted
swiftly around the elegantly furnished room
and came to rest on the heavily figured
cantonese hanging that draped the window
indicated by cartwright

   i tell you i leeb little light showin at
window all time see when pattison pay
money ah sin will shut off lights then
ah sin quick make em light again
sabby

  good enough agreed cartwright ill
watch the window

nthe door closed behind the white man

  for a moment chong stood still lis-
tening then he glided swiftly to the censer
bent over and grasped it by the turned
edges to all appearances the censer was a
massive affair of hammered brass the
huge bowl appeared to be full of sand in
which stood nine sticks of burning punk
chong however lifted the bowl with sur-
prising ease revealing the figure of a chi-
nese sitting on the rug his head bent in a
listening attitude his arms clasped around
his knees

  chong spoke now in rapid cantonese
  ah sin did you listen sharp

  i heard everything replied ah sin
springing to his feet like a cat its a
clever scheme

  chong grunted its a clever trap he
said laconically

  ah sin blinked but made no reply to
this

  a foreign devil who is false to his own
people will not be true to us said the old
smuggler cartwright told me that he is
still in the employ of the police he lied
detectives cartwright and minard were dis-
missed this morning for good reasons they
were caught selling opium that had been
seized as evidence

  haie breathed ah sin in sudden
alarm then of course you will have
nothing to do with this mans scheme
chongs brow lowered in a black scowl
cartwright is a dangerous man he said
thoughtfully i am afraid to cross him
also i am afraid to go on with his scheme
whichever way i turn i am in danger i
see no way out however it is written that
a bamboo fence seen at a distance appears
impregnable while on closer view one may
find an opening tsau kom lok

it was exactly eleven oclock by chongs
gold watch when dan pattison rapped on
the door chong admitted him neither
spoke until the door had been closed again

  pattison unacquainted as he was with
chinatown nevertheless had the sure man-
ner of the crook who plays only when he
thinks he has protection for a moment
he eyed the old smuggler with an air of
superiority that bordered on insolence
then he handed chong a card

  who gib you this queried chong po-
litely

  pattisons lips curled get busy and cut
the talk you see the card dont you
chong nodded his approval he tore the
card to bits and tossed them into the ash
tray then he drew one of the hangings
aside disclosing a large wall-safe he
opened the safe and brought out a small
brown suitcase

  chong set the suitcase on the table and
opened it inside arranged in neat order
were fifty cans each about twice the size
of an ordinary deck of playing-cards on
each can was a label bearing chinese char-
acters that meant nothing to pattison to
chong they spelled no  smoking
opium macao

the white man selected three of the cans
pried up the lids and smelled the black
gummy contents then he dipped up a
small quantity on the end of a match
heated it over the flame of another match
and held his nostrils over the white vapor
book magazine

  all right chinky said pattison he
drew out a roll of bills and began counting
them

  chong watched the count meanwhile re-
packing and closing the suitcase

  here is the money said pattison
  here is your opum said chong

  then-the lights went out

  there was an instant of darkness the
lights came on again

  chong picked up the pile of bills pat-
tison took the brown suitcase and left

  the opium-dealer was putting the money
in the safe when ah sin entered chong
closed the safe and went quickly to the
teakwood table he opened the drawer
and took out a chinese dagger with a short
but wickedly curved blade

  take this he said to ah sin be on
your way quickly and remember if you
strike a tiger and do not kill him you be-
come his prey

in shanghai alley behind a pile of old tea-
boxes two men bent over a small brown
suitcase

  dead easy chuckled minard pat-
tison was so scared i bet he is running yet
when he reads nothing of this in the papers
hell do some tall guessing eh

  let em all guess growled cartwright
tonight we clean up and blow for good
get that other package open

  here it is said minard

  good cartwright chuckled now
out of the little brown bag comes chongs
fifty cans of good opium into the little
brown bag goes our fifty opium-cans filled
with axle-grease with a thin layer of opium
on top

  minard laughed

  ill take the suitcase with the fifty cans
of grease up to chong went on cart-
wright ill collect the four thousand dol-
lars then ill come right back here four
thousand dollars and fifty cans of opium-
not so bad for a nights work eh

  not so bad agreed minard -if
chong doesnt get wise

  chongs a fool said cartwright he

by dris deming



might open a can look at it smell it but
he wont bother to dig into it the cans
look all alike so he wont suspect itll be
bad for his health if he does get me

  i get you replied minard he took
the package cartwright gave him and
turned to leave

  behind him he heard a sudden startled
gasp he whirled a shadowy figure had
leaped upon cartwright a naked blade
short but wickedly curved caught the faint
gleam of the street-lamp at the end of the
alley glittered for an instant then van-
ished there was the dull sound of a blow
a hideous gurgling moan then--silence
minard fled

co that was it  chong rumbled into the
mouthpiece of his long-stemmed pipe
they robbed pattison and intended to
swindle me with cans of axle-grease

  sir that is correct cried ah sin
greatly agitated and now i must tell you
how wretchedly i have failed i brought
you only the brown suitcase with the fiftv
cans of grease minard escaped with your
fifty cans of opium

  haie cried chong you were very
careless 

  i did my best sir i had no chance at
minard he got away while i was-ah-
taking care of cartwright

  will cartwright bother us any more
the dead do not trouble the living
said ah sin solemnly

  then said chong you have done well
enough as for minard-well this after-
noon when i had smoked my four pipes of
opium i saw a way out of cartwrights
trap i made ready when you turned
off the lights to signal cartwright i
switched my suitcase of opium for another
exactly like it that i had ready on that
stool beneath the table

  so after all it is very funny my
opium is still there in the safe i have
the five thousand dollars cartwright will
bother us no more and minard is running
away with fifty opium-cans full of black
molasses

the plymouth express affair

          the little gray cells so often referred to by the great de-
          tective hercule poirot certainly get in their fine-work in this
          intriguing mystery story by an exceptionally talented writer

by agatha christie

alec simpson r n stepped from
the platform at newton abbot into
 a first-class compartment of the
plymouth express a porter followed him
with a heavy suitcase he was about to
swing it up to the rack but the young
sailor stopped him

  no-leave it on the seat ill put it up
later here you are

  thank you sir the porter gener-
ously tipped withdrew

  doors banged a stentorian voice
shouted plymouth only change for
torquay plymouth next stop then a
whistle blew and the train drew slowly out
of the station

  lieutenant simpson had the carriage to
himself the december air was chilly and
he pulled up the window then he sniffed
vaguely and frowned what a smell there
was reminded him of that time in hos-
pital and the operation on his leg yes
chloroform that was it

  he let the window down again changing
his seat to one with its back to the engine
he pulled a pipe out of his pocket and lit

it for a little time he sat inactive look-
ing out into the night and smoking

  at last he roused himself and opening
the suitcase took out some papers and
magazines then closed the suitcase again
and endeavored to shove it under the op-
posite seat-without success some hidden
obstacle resisted it he shoved harder with
rising impatience but it still stuck out half-
way into the carriage

  why the devil wont it go in he mut-
tered and hauling it out completely he
stooped down and peered under the
seat

  a moment later a cry rang out into the
night and the great train came to an un-
willing halt in obedience to the imperative
jerking of the communication-cord

jvion ami said poirot you have
i know been deeply interested in this
mystery of the plymouth express read
this

  i picked up the note he flicked across
the table to me it was brief and to the
point
the plymouth express affair

  dear sir

    i shall be obliged if you will call upon me
   at your earliest convenience

yours faithfully

                      ebenezer halliday

  the connection was not clear to my
mind and i looked inquiringly at poirot
for answer he took up the newspaper and
read aloud

   a sensational discovery was made last
night a young naval officer returning to
plymouth found under the seat of his com-
partment the body of a woman stabbed
through the heart the officer at once
pulled the communication-cord and the
train was brought to a standstill the
woman who was about thirty years of age
and richly dressed has not yet been identi-
fied

  and later we have this the woman
found dead in the plymouth express has
been identified as the honorable mrs
rupert carrington you see now my
friend or if you do not i will add this
mrs rupert carrington was before her
marriage flossie halliday daughter of old
man halliday the steel king of america
and he has sent for you splendid
i did him a little service in the past-
an affair of bearer bonds and once when
i was in paris for a royal visit i had
mademoiselle flossie pointed out to me
la jolie petite pensionnaire she had the
jolie dot too it caused trouble she
nearly made a bad affair

  how was that

  a certain count de la rochefour un
bien mauvais sujetl a bad hat as you
would say an adventurer pure and sim-
ple who knew how to appeal to a romantic
young girl luckily her father got wind of
it in time he took her back to america in
haste i heard of her marriage some years
later but i know nothing of her husband
hm i said the honorable rupert
carrington is no beauty by all acounts
hed pretty well run through his own
money on the turf and i should imagine
old man hallidays dollars came along in
the nick of time i should say that for a
good-looking well-mannered utterly un-
scrupulous young scoundrel it would be
hard to find his match

  ah the poor little lady elle nest pas
bien tombee

  i fancy he made it pretty obvious at
once that it was her money and not she
that had attracted him i believe they
drifted apart almost at once i have heard

by agatha christie



rumors lately that there was to be a definite
legal separation

  old man halliday is no fool he would
tie up her money pretty tight

  i dare say anyway i know as a fact
that the honorable rupert is said to be
extremely hard up

  ah-ha i wonder-

  you wonder what

  my good friend do not jump down my
throat like that you are interested i see
supposing you accompany me to see mr
halliday there is a taxi stand at the
corner

a very few minutes sufficed to whirl
us to the superb house in park lane
rented by the american magnate we were
shown into the library and almost imme-
diately we were joined by a large stout
man with piercing eyes and an aggressive
chin

  m poirot said mr halliday i
guess i dont need to tell you what i want
you for youve read the papers and im
never one to let the grass grow under my
feet i happened to hear you were in lon-
don and i remembered the good work you
did over those bonds never forget a
name ive got the pick of scotland yard
but ill have my own man as well money
no object all the dollars were made for
my little girl-and now shes gone ill
spend my last cent to catch the damned
scoundrel that did it see so its up to
you to deliver the goods

  poirot bowed

  i accept monsieur all the more will-
ingly that i saw your daughter in paris
several times and now i will ask you to
tell me the circumstances of her journey to
plymouth and any other details that seem
to you to bear upon the case

  well to begin with responded hal-
liday she wasnt going to plymouth she
was going to join a house-party at avon-
mead court the duchess of swanseas
place she left london by the twelve-four-
teen from paddington arriving at bristol
where she had to change at two-fifty
the principal plymouth expresses of
course run via westbury and do not go
near bristol at all the twelve-fourteen
does a nonstop run to bristol afterward
stopping at weston taunton exeter and
newton abbot my daughter traveled
alone in her carriage which was reserved
as far as bristol her maid being in a third-
class carriage in the next coach
the plymouth express affair

doirot nodded and mr halliday went

	on the party at avonmead court
was to be a very gay one with several balls
and in consequence my daughter had with
her nearly all her jewels-amounting in
value perhaps to about a hundred thousand
dollars

  un moment interrupted poirot who
had charge of the jewels your daughter
or the maid

  my daughter always took charge of
them herself carrying them in a small blue
morocco case

  continue monsieur

  at bristol the maid jane mason col-
lected her mistress dressing-bag and wraps
which were with her and came to the door
of flossies compartment to her intense
surprise my daughter told her that she was
not getting out at bristol but was going on
farther she directed mason to get out the
luggage and put it in the cloak-room she
could have tea in the refreshment-room
but she was to wait at the station for her
mistress who would return to bristol by
an up-train in the course of the afternoon
the maid although very much astonished
did as she was told she put the luggage
in the cloak-room and had some tea but
up-train after up-train came in and her
mistress did not appear after the arrival
of the last train she left the luggage where
it was and went to a hotel near the station
for the night this morning she read of
the tragedy and returned to town by the
first available train

  is there nothing to account for your
daughters sudden change of plan

  well there is this according to jane
mason at bristol flossie was no longer
alone in her carriage there was a man in
it who stood looking out of the farther
window so that she could not see his face
the train was a corridor one of
course

  yes

  which side was the corridor

  on the platform side my daughter
was standing in the corridor as she talked
to mason

  and there is no doubt in your mind-
excuse me he got up and carefully
straightened the inkstand which was a little
askew je vous demande pardon he
continued reseating himself it affects
my nerves to see anything crooked strange
is it not i was saying monsieur that
there is no doubt in your mind as to this
probably unexpected meeting being the

the blue

cause of your daughters sudden change of
plan

  it seems the only reasonable supposi-
tion

  you have no idea as to who the gentle-
man in question might be

  the millionaire hesitated for a moment
and then replied

  no-i do not know at all

  now-as to the discovery of the body
it was discovered by a young naval
officer who at once gave the alarm there
was a doctor on the train he examined
the body she had been first chloroformed
and then stabbed he gave it as his opinion
that she had been dead about four hours
so it must have been done not long after
leaving bristol -probably between there
and weston possibly between weston and
taunton

  and the jewel-case

  the jewel-case m poirot was missing
one thing more monsieur your
daughters fortune-to whom does it pass
at her death

  flossie made a will soon after her mar-
riage leaving everything to her husband
he hesitated for a minute and then went
on i may as well tell you monsieur poi-
rot that i regard my son-in-law as an un-
principled scoundrel and that by my ad-
vice my daughter was on the eve of freeing
herself from him by legal means-no diffi-
cult matter i settled her money upon her
in such a way that he could not touch it
during her lifetime but although they have
lived entirely apart for some years she
has frequently acceded to his demands for
money rather than face an open scandal
however i was determined to put an end
o this and at last flossie agreed and my
lawyers were instructed to take proceed-
ings

  and where is monsieur carrington
in town i believe he was away in the
country yesterday but he returned last
night

  poirot considered a little while then
he said i think that is all monsieur
you would like to see the maid jane
mason

  if you please

i talliday rang the bell and gave a

	short order to the footman a few
minutes later jane mason entered the room
a respectable hard-featured woman as
emotionless in the face of tragedy as only
a good servant can be


book magazine

  you will permit me to put a few ques-
tions your mistress she was quite as
usual before starting yesterday morning
not excited or flurried

  oh no sir

  but at bristol she was quite different
yes sir regular upset-so nervous she
didnt seem to know what she was saying
what did she say exactly

  well sir as near as i can remember
she said mason ive got to alter my
plans something has happened-i mean
im not getting out here after all i must
go on get out the luggage and put it in
the cloak-room then have some tea and
wait for me in the station

   wait for you here maam i asked
 yes yes dont leave the station i
shall return by a later train i dont know
when it maynt be until quite late

   very well maam i says it wasnt
my place to ask questions but i thought it
very strange

  it was unlike your mistress eh

  very unlike her sir

  what did you think

  well sir i thought it was to do with
the gentleman in the carriage she didnt
speak to him but she turned round once
or twice as though to ask him if she was
doing right

  but you didnt see the gentlemans
face

  no sir he stood with his back to me
all the time

  can you describe him at all

  he had on a light fawn overcoat and
a traveling cap he was tall and slender
like and the back of his head was dark
you didnt know him

  oh no i dont think so sir

  it was not your master mr carring-
ton by any chance

  mason looked rather startled

  oh i dont think so sir

  but you are not sure

  it was about the masters build sir-
but i never thought of it being him we
so seldom saw him i couldnt say it wasnt
him 

  poirot picked up a pin from the carpet
and frowned at it severely then he con-
tinued would it be possible for the
man to have entered the train at bristol
before you reached the carriage

  mason considered

  yes sir i think it would my com-
partment was very crowded and it was
some minutes before i could get out-and

by agatha christie



then there was a very large crowd on the
platform and that delayed me too but
hed only have had a minute or two to
speak to the mistress that way i took
it for granted that hed come along the
corridor

  that is more probable certainly

  he paused still frowning

  you know how the mistress was dressed
sir

  the papers give a few details but i
would like you to confirm them

  she was wearing a white fox fur toque
sir with a white spotted veil and a blue
frieze coat and skirt-the shade of blue
they call electric

  hm rather striking

  yes remarked halliday inspector
japp is in hopes that that may help us to
fix the spot where the crime took place
anyone who saw her would remember her
precisement -thank you mademoi-
selle the maid left the room

  well poirot got up briskly that is
all i can do here-except monsieur that
i would ask you to tell me everything-
but everything

  i have done so

  you are sure

  absolutely

  then there is nothing more to be said
i must decline the case

 why

  because you have not been frank with
me

  i assure you-

  no you are keeping something back

there was a moments pause and then
halliday drew a paper from his pocket
and handed it to my friend

  i guess thats what youre after mon-
sieur poirot--though how you know about
it fairly gets my goat 

  poirot smiled and unfolded the paper
it was a letter written in thin sloping hand-
writing poirot read it aloud

   chere madame

      it is with infinite pleasure that i
look forward to the felicity of meeting you
again after your so amiable reply to my
letter i can hardly restrain my impatience
i have never forgotten those days in paris
it is most cruel that you should be leaving
london tomorrow however before very
long and perhaps sooner than you think
i shall have the joy of beholding once more
the lady whose image has ever reigned
supreme in my heart

   believe chere madame all the assur-
ances of my most devoted and unaltered
sentiments-

          armand de la rochefour 
poirot handed the letter back to halli-
day with a bow

  i fancy monsieur that you did not
know that your daughter intended renew-
ing her acquaintance with the count de la
rochefour

  it came as a thunderbolt to me i
found this letter in my daughters handbag
as you probably know monsieur poirot
this so-called count is an adventurer of the
worst type

  poirot nodded

  but what i want to know is how you
knew of the existence of this letter

  my friend smiled monsieur i did not
but to track footmarks and recognize ciga-
rette-ash is not sufficient for a detective
he must also be a good psychologist i
knew that you disliked and mistrusted your
son-in-law he benefits by your daughters
death the maids description of the mys-
terious man bears a sufficient resemblance
to him yet you are not keen on his track
why surely because your suspicions lie
in another direction therefore you were
keeping something back

  youre right monsieur poirot i was
sure of ruperts guilt until i found this
letter it unsettled me horribly

  yes the count says before very
long and perhaps sooner than you think
obviously he would not want to wait until
you should get wind of his reappearance
was it he who traveled down from london
by the twelve-fourteen and came along the
corridor to your daughters compartment
the count de la rochefour is also if i
remember rightly tall and dark

  the millionaire nodded

  well monsieur i will wish you good
day scotland yard has i presume a list
of the jewels

  yes i believe inspector japp is here
now if you would like to see him

japp was an old friend of ours and
 greeted poirot with a sort of affectionate
contempt

  and how are you monsieur no bad
feeling between us though we have got our
different ways of looking at things how
are the little gray cells eh going
strong

  poirot beamed upon him they func-
tion my good japp assuredly they do

the blue

  then thats all right think it was the
honorable rupert or a crook were
keeping an eye on all the regular places of
course we shall know if the shiners are
disposed of and of course whoever did it
isnt going to keep them to admire their
sparkle not likely im trying to find
out where rupert carrington was yester-
day seems a bit of a mystery about it
ive got a man watching him

  a great precaution but perhaps a day
late suggested poirot gently

  you always will have your joke mon-
sieur poirot well im off to paddington
bristol weston taunton thats my beat
so long

  you will come round and see me this
evening and tell me the result

  sure thing if im back

  that good inspector believes in matter
in motion murmured poirot as our friend
departed he travels he measures foot-
prints he collects mud and cigarette-ash
he is extremely busy he is zealous be-
yond words and if i mentioned psychol-
ogy to him do you know what he would
do my friend he would smile he
would say to himself poor old poirot he
ages he grows senile japp is the
younger generation knocking on the door
and ma foi they are so busy knocking
that they do not notice that the door is
open

  and what are you going to do

  as we have carte blanche i shall ex-
pend threepence in ringing up the ritz-
where you may have noticed our count is
staying after that as my feet are a little
damp and i have sneezed twice i shall
return to my rooms and make myself a
tisano over the spirit lamp

i did not see poirot again until the fol-

	lowing morning i found him placidly
finishing his breakfast

  well i inquired eagerly what has
happened

  nothing

  but japp

  i have not seen him

  the count

  he left the ritz the day before yester-
day

  the day of the murder

  yes

  then that settles it rupert carring-
ton is cleared

  because the count de la rochefour has
left the ritz you go too fast my friend


book magazine

  anyway he must be followed arrested
but what could be his motive

  one hundred thousand dollars worth of
jewelry is a very good motive for anyone
no the question to my mind is why kill
her why not simply steal the jewels
she would not prosecute

  why not

  because she is a woman mon ami she
once loved this man therefore she would
suffer her loss in silence and the count
who is an extremely good psychologist
where women are concerned-hence his
successes-would know that perfectly well
on the other hand if rupert carrington
killed her why take the jewels which
would incriminate him fatally

  as a blind

  perhaps you are right my friend ah
here is japp i recognize his knock

  the inspector was beaming good-hu-
moredly

  morning poirot only just got back
ive done some good work and you
me i have arranged my ideas replied
poirot placidly

  japp laughed heartily

old chaps getting on in years he ob-
served beneath his breath to me that
wont do for us young folk he said aloud
quel dommage poirot inquired
well do you want to hear what ive
done

  you permit me to make a guess you
have foftmd the knife with which the crime
was committed by the side of the line be-
tween weston and taunton and you have
interviewed the paper-boy who spoke to
mrs carrington at weston

japps jaw fell how on earth did you
know dont tell me it was those al-
mighty little gray cells of yours

  i am glad you admit for once that they
are all mighty tell me did she give the
paper-boy a shilling for himself

  no it was half a crown japp re-
covered his temper and grinned pretty
extravagant these rich americans

  and in consequence the boy did not
forget her

  not he half-crowns dont come his
way every day she hailed him and bought
two magazines one had a picture of a girl
in blue on the cover thatll match me
she said oh he remembered her per-
fectly well that was enough for me by
the doctors evidence the crime must have
been committed before taunton i guessed

by agatha christie



theyd throw the knife away at once and
i walked down the line looking for it and
sure enough there it was i made inquiries
at taunton about our man but of course
its a big station and it wasnt likely theyd
notice him he probably got back to lon-
don by a later train

  poirot nodded very likely

  but i found another bit of news when
i got back theyre passing the jewels all
right that large emerald was pawned last
night-by one of the regular lot who do
you think it was

  i dont know-except that he was a
short man

  japp stared well youre right there
hes short enough it was red narky
who on earth is red narky i asked
a particularly sharp jewel-thief sir
and not one to stick at murder usually
works with a woman-gracie kidd but
she doesnt seem to be in it this time-un-
less shes got off to holland with the rest
of the swag

  youve arrested narky

  sure thing but mind you its the
other man we want-the man who went
down with mrs carrington in the train
he was the one who planned the job right
enough but narky wont squeal on a pal
i noticed that poirots eyes had become
very green

  i think he said gently that i can
find narkys pal for you all right

  one of your little ideas eh japp
eyed poirot sharply wonderful how you
manage to deliver the goods sometimes at
your age and all devils own luck of
course

  perhaps perhaps murmured my
friend hastings my hat and the brush
so my galoshes if it still rains we
must not undo the good work of that tisano
au revoir japp

  good luck to you poirot

  poirot hailed the first taxi we met and
directed the driver to park lane

when we drew up before hallidays
 house he skipped out nimbly paid the
driver and rang the bell to the footman
who opened the door he made a request in
a low voice and we were immediately taken
upstairs we went up to the top of the
house and were shown into a small neat
bedroom

  poirots eyes roved round the room and
fastened themselves on a small black trunk
he knelt in front of it scrutinized the
the plymouth express affair

labels on it and took a small twist of wire
from his pocket

  ask mr halliday if he will be so kind
as to mount to me here he said over his
shoulder to the footman

it is suggested that the reader pause in his
perusal of the story at this point make his
own solution of the mystery-and then see
how close he comes to that of the author-
the editors

  the man departed and poirot gently
coaxed the lock of the trunk with a prac-
ticed hand in a few minutes the lock
gave and he raised the lid of the trunk
swiftly he began rummaging among the
clothes it contained flinging them out on
the floor

  there was a heavy step on the stairs
and halliday entered the room

  what in hell are you doing here he
demanded staring

  i was looking monsieur for this poi-
rot withdrew from the trunk a coat and
skirt of bright blue frieze and a small toque
of white fox fur

  what are you doing with my trunk
i turned to see that the maid jane mason
had just entered the room

  if you will just shut the door hastings
thank you yes and stand with your
back against it now mr halliday let
me introduce you to grade kidd other-
wise jane mason who will shortly rejoin
her accomplice red narky under the kind
escort of japp

it was of the most simple poirot
 waved a deprecating hand then helped
himself to more caviare it is not every
day that one lunches with a millionaire

  it was the maids insistence on the
clothes that her mistress was wearing that
first struck me why was she so anxious
that our attention should be directed to
them i reflected that we had only the
maids word for the mysterious man in the
carriage at bristol as far as the doctors
evidence went mrs carrington might easily
have been murdered before reaching bristol
but if so then the maid must be an ac-
complice and if she were an accomplice
she would not wish this point to rest on
her evidence alone the clothes mrs car-
rington was wearing were of a striking na-
ture a maid usually has a good deal of

by agatha christie



choice as to what her mistress shall wear
now if after bristol anyone saw a lady
in a bright blue coat and skirt and a fur
toque he will be quite ready to swear he
has seen mrs carrington

  i began to reconstruct the maid would
provide herself with duplicate clothes she
and her accomplice chloroform and stab
mrs carrington between london and bris-
tol probably taking advantage of a tunnel
her body is rolled under the seat the maid
takes her place at weston she must make
herself noticed how in all probability
a newspaper-boy will be selected she will
insure his remembering her by giving him
a large tip she also drew his attention
to the color of her dress by a remark about
one of the magazines after leaving wes-
ton she throws the knife out of the win-
dow to mark the place where the crime pre-
sumably occurred and changes her clothes
or buttons a long mackintosh over them
at taunton she leaves the train and returns
to bristol as soon as possible whera her
accomplice has duly left the luggage in
the cloak-room he hands over the ticket
and himself returns to london she waits
on the platform carrying out her role goes
to a hotel for the night and returns to town
in the morning exactly as she said

  when japp returned from his expedi-
tion he confirmed all my deductions he
also told me that a well-known crook was
passing the jewels i knew that whoever
it was would be the exact opposite of the
man jane mason described when i heard
that it was red narky who always worked
with gracie kidd-well i knew just where
to find her

  and the count

  the more i thought of it the more i
was convinced that he had nothing to do
with it that gentleman is much too care-
ful of his own skin to risk murder it
would be out of keeping with his character
well monsieur poirot said halliday
i owe you a big debt and the check i
write after lunch wont go near to settling
it

  poirot smiled modestly and murmured
to me the good japp he shall get the
official credit all right but though he has
got his gracie kidd i think that i as the
americans say have got his goat

   its not easy to keep the secret ofa rich mine when the sea-wolves
   are on ones trail-as witness this thrilling story on the trail
   of a platinum mine - one of the gifted mr zandtts best

by culpeper zandtt

when the australian cargo-boat
wallacoomba berthed at a pier in
san francisco harbor two deck-
hands who had shipped for the trip up
from balboa drew their pay and went
ashore-seedy in appearance with nothing
but their small earnings between them and
the beach they had stowed themselves
in the hold of a much larger boat in syd-
ney harbor with the intention of spying
upon her activities and locating an im-
mensely rich platinum lode-ore from
which the steamer had brought to sydney
for sale but they had been discovered
and transshipped at sea to a wool-boat
which had cleared for london short-
handed-her master guaranteeing that hed
work them on his craft as far as that port
at least having other views however
jones and wohlberg had jumped overboard
just off the pacific entrance to the canal
managed to swim ashore picked up an odd
job or two which fed them for a week and
then shipped north after reading a notice in
the maritime news that the steamer wyano-

mah upon which they originally stowed
themselves had arrived at san diego
when it was generally supposed that she
was bound to some port several thousand
miles from there and would load for an
eastern voyage in san francisco

  wohlberg an island pearler and some-
time pirate was the more reckless of the
two-the tougher fighter in any sort of a
mix-up but jones who had been a
broken hill miner before going in for a
course of engineering study was the more
farsighted had much the shrewder wits it
was he who decided upon their next move
as they walked up toward market street

  weve less than eighty dollars between
us-aye and we must eat-aye but
therell be a man in this town wholl pay
for what we can tell him-give us a share
of the pickings if there are any-provided
weve luck in getting to him thatll be
the difficlty hes by way of being a
swell-expensive offices great house and
estate in the country-clubs society all
that well never reach him as we look


deep-water men

now so well just blow in the most of
our tin on clothes shaves hair-trimming
and visiting-cards ill do the passing upon
everything myself-because ive seen the
time when i knew what was what are
you on

  a few hours later the pair stepped into
 one of the newer office-buildings on
market street and were taken up to a
luxuriously furnished suite of offices on the
twelfth floor from the windows of which
there was an extensive view of the bay
had any of their former shipmates seen
them-or even the master himself-recog-
nition would have been almost impossible
two men of different breeding may each
invest thirty dollars in clothes and haber-
dashery with amazingly opposite results
it isnt the cost of his clothes which stamps
a man of the world with a compelling per-
sonality but their selection and the way
in which they are worn aside from this
instinctive knowledge jones and wohlberg
had rubbed against the sharp edges of life
enough to give them poise-the impression
of being at their ease in almost any com-
bination of circumstances for all of these
reasons the pair of speculators were pres-
ently admitted to a comer room of the
suite where mr corbelston an active man
of fifty with heavy features and iron-gray
hair sat behind a large flat-topped desk
his whole appearance indicated power
the closeness with which his eyes were set
together and the grim lines of his mouth
spoke of power unscrupulously used the
man was in demand at clubs social func-
tions in business circles-as a personage
on the whole he was rather liked but
there was a reserve opinion that he could
be something more than unpleasant if he
had occasion to go after anyone in earnest
nobody knew whether he had one million
or ten-but his credit was good for some-
thing over the one at least and the way
he got it was of no consequence

orbelston was holding jones card
 in his hand-looking reflectively out of
the window as they came in with a nod
he indicated a couple of chairs near the
end of his desk-not intimately so but
near enough for confidential talk

  i remember you jones-perfectly you
did me a good turn over there in australia
-though i guess you didnt know how
good well i gave what you asked--we
considered the incident closed but ive

the blue

thought more than once that if you ever
turned up again id hand you a check for
a couple of thousand-just so you couldnt
feel that i had a little too much the best
of it-would be disposed to make another
deal if things shaped up that way ill
give you that check now

  not on the old account mr corbel-
ston that was settled in full at the time
i knew what youd get out of it and was
entirely satisfied-because i fancied it
might get me an interview with you upon
some occasion when otherwise id never
get by your office people or the butler in
your house im here with wohlberg to
sketch the facts of a certain situation as
we know them-and see if youre in-
trested

  shoot

  two or three months ago a nine-thou-
sand-ton cargo-boat came into a certain
port-in ballast judging by her freeboard
-actually with a part-cargo of the richest
platinum-bearing matrix-ore ever discov-
ered the charterer who might or might
not have been the mine-operator didnt
wish it reduced for owners account
would listen to no proposition but pur-
chase of that ore outright as it lay in the
hold finally sold it and cleaned up more
than six hundred thousand dollars for
what there was on board the boat was
then cleared for brisbane in ballast-with
some talk of running over to auckland for
balance of cargo instead of that she
turns up in one of your pacific ports the
smelting compny of course put men of
their own on her track-cabled their agents
in various ports wohlberg and i got
aboard and stowed ourselves in her num-
ber two but the master discovered us-we
were transferred at sea to a wool-boat lon-
don-bound jumped overboard at balboa
-shipped on the first boat coming this
way-paid off on the pier this morning
you see that charterer refused to give any
information whatever as to the location of
the mine or who is operating it now-
whats the natural inference-out in east-
ern waters

   m-w-e---id say either the mine is so
far from civilization that the present opera-
tor knows he cant hold it against an at-
tack in force-or else he may have a land-
title to the ground which doesnt cover
mining-rights of any description in the
last case hes between two fires-risk of
confiscation by the parties or the govern-
ment from whom he purchased and the


book magazine

chance of being wiped out by some expedi-
tion with men enough to do it when theres
no warship within call

  in either case that platinum mine--a
few thousand tons from it selling for nearly
three-quarters of a million-belongs to who-
ever can take and hold it eh

  oh-tut-tut thats robbery

  take some proving to make it so-
would it not

  h-m-m jones i think one reason why
you interest me is your habit of eliminat-
ing the nonessentials and getting down to
bed facts well-suppose an expedition
did locate and take possession of that
mine it would be the word of the well-
equipped well-manned operating company
against a weak claimant as far as the legal
status went but in getting possession
you might unfortunately kill the previous
operator-possibly his whole force-eh
a very serious offense-not

  oh thats putting such a contingency
in its worst light any compny is per-
mitted by law to protect its property
against attack-protect the lives of its
operating force of course if a handful
of soreheads choose to make trouble while
we are peaceably operating our mine and
get shot while doing it no court is going
to blame us for acting in self-defense-
particularly if none of the other party is
left alive to tell some cock-and-bull story
about previous ownership what

  corbelston threw back his head and
laughed he was just that cold-blooded
himself-though with a deceiving veneer
which made him appear a gentleman with
no conscientious scruples to hold him back
or trip him up it is difficult to keep a per-
son of that sort from accumulating what
doesnt belong to him even to the fullness
thereof-and laughing at the helpless vic-
tims as a rule hes too smart to be
caught actually outside the law-and if he
is caught he knows exactly what a hun-
dred thousand or so will do by way of get-
ting him loose again he cast another ap-
praising glance over the two men then he
asked

  you havent a sample of that ore with
you i suppose it must have been al-
most impossible to hang on to it with all
youve been through

  worth giving some thought to none the
less without a sample wed have dif-
ficlty in gettin anyone intrested i had
this in a belt under my shirt-fancy ive
not lost a grain of it youll have it

by culpeper zandtt



analyzed of course-but return to me as
much as possible of it

  hmph ive a mineralogist of my own
as it happens-need him in various deals
you can bring your stuff along when we
go to see him presently-stand by and
watch until hes through with his blow-
pipe testing is either of you a navigator
wohlberg holds a masters ticket for
sail and a mates for steam im both a
mechanical and a mining engineer

  then theres no need of letting in any
of those shell-backs alongshore to split
profits with us and blab when theyre
drunk you two command the expedition
-if your stuff tests out as you say ill
give each of you a quarter-share in any-
thing we get and five thousand for im-
mediate expenses you havent given me
any workable details yet-description of
ship port charterer smelting company
but i expect you to do that when you get
the ten thousand then ill decide
whether to stop there or whether theres a
gambling chance in really going after that
stuff come along well see the min-
eralogist first-then have dinner and block
out some plan of action

three days later miss avery was
putting her cabin in order for a voyage
across the pacific in the nine-thousand-ton
cargo-boat wyanomah-joseph allen mas-
ter-which had been loading flour and
heavy-case goods for manila while she
was arranging some of her recent purchases
allen came in-bolting the door after him
from mere force of habit

  going ashore again this afternoon
claire

  yes i want to get a few more things
before we leave youll clear tomorrow
will you

  well-well have everything in before
breakfast-theres no reason why we
shouldnt though capn jennings has been
nosing around california street to see if
he can pick up anything we should guard
against and it might be to our advantage
if we waited a day longer of course he
has no idea who is really chartering his
boat-back of you and he doesnt give a
darn-says your word and your fathers
were always as good as your bond but
he knows all about the stuff we took down
to sydney-knows well run more cargoes
of it if we get the chance and would like
nothing better than to come along as pas-
senger and watch us play the game i was
deep-water men



the blue

almost tempted to invite him-but the
rajah might object and he can help us
more by staying here in frisco and being
honestly ignorant of what were doing
what do you think claire is anyone
after us right now-or have we bluffed
everybody with our regular ships business
since we cleared from sydney

  that depends a whole lot upon how
much gossip there was around darling
harbor when we left that president of
the smelting company is a pretty hard-
boiled proposition-there isnt a doubt
that he cabled his agents in more than one
port to keep track of us but theyd hesi-
tate about going very far without plainer
orders than hed give by cable and i
dont think those stowaways had any con-
nection with him-

  in spite of the fact that they got
aboard of us from one of the companys
ore-barges

  they could easily have gotten them-
selves taken on as extra shovelers-and
manners is too smart to attempt anything
as likely to point suspicion directly at him
when we found them which we were al-
most certain to do he wants more of
that ore-it paid him a frightful profit

  then there was knowledge going about
sydney as to what sort of stuff we brought
there 

  enough to put those two men aboard of
us anyhow-but they might have stumbled
upon it accidentally and had good reason
to keep their mouths shut theyre in
london by now-cant get here before we
leave-

  it would seem not-unless they got
loose somewhere along the canal

  ive been thinking of that well over-
haul the boat pretty thoroughly when were
past the farralones if we dont find any-
body except our own crew aboard i dont
see how they can interfere with us much-
short of catching us at the island by sheer
accident

  you cant be sure of anything in this
sort of game-except that our unknown
adversary is working just as much in the
dark as we are-but is not going to sleep
on the job well-ill clear her by noon
youll be aboard either tonight or soon
after breakfast i suppose capn jen-
nings says hes coming down to get better
acquainted with you before we pull out-
the old boy seems to have fallen for you
pretty hard--says it took man-size nerve to
put through that deal in sydney

vvith all their caution and forethought
 it had not occurred to either of them
that anybody could have an object in
molesting one or the other in a port where
their business of securing cargo for their
boat at more or less profitable freights was
so perfectly obvious the wyanomah was
loading a full cargo of bona-fide merchan-
dise and there wasnt an extra displace-
ment-ton in which she could have carried
anything else if her charterer had wished to
so miss avery took a jitney up to market
street and made purchases in a couple of
stores where she was known by name-then
went to see an acquaintance in one of the
office-buildings remaining for over an hour

  when she came out upon the sidewalk
a neatly uniformed chauffeur stepped
across from an expensive car at the curb
touched his cap asked if she were not
miss avery-and handed her a note in
a stylish envelope explaining that he had
traced her to the last shop in which she
had made a purchase and that one of the
clerks had pointed her out to him just as
she entered the office-building he had
waited there for her to come out again

  the man and the car had every appear-
ance of quiet respectability after glanc-
ing over them a second time she opened
the envelope and read the note the paper
was rich and creamy with the name of a
country estate engraved at the top

  my dear miss avery

    very much to my regret my chauffeur was
  unfortunate enough to run down captain
  joseph allen of the steamer wyanomah at
  a crossing when he was coming up from his
  pier he was unconscious when we picked
  him up-but stopping for a doctor on the
  way we took him out to my home a few
  miles south of the city and he was able to
  speak by the time we reached there after
  examining him the doctor thinks a fractured
  leg and bruises about the body are the worst
  of his injuries-hopes to have him out again
  within a month if nothing else develops

    but his recovery will be retarded if he has
  anything to worry about-and he began ask-
  ing at once that you be sent for as there
  are a number of matters which you must
  handle in his absence as i understand it
  his ship was to leave tomorrow and he seems
  anxious to have her go even if he has to re-
  join her later in some other port im not
  familiar with the shipping business but i
  suppose there are expenses which run up
  against a ship if she remains in port after
  her cargo is in ready to leave the doctor
  used an anesthetic while setting the leg and
  im sending my chauffeur at once to see if
  he cant trace you and bring you out here by
  the time captain allen is able to talk again

                   respectfully

  on the face of it there was nothing
suspicious about the note the name
seemed vaguely familiar to her as that of
a rich society man about thirty-five who
lived in one of the show-places of the
suburbs and whose grandfather had been
a forty-niner from boston but just to
make sure of this she went back into the
lobby of the office-building and looked him
up in the suburban telephone-book name
and address appeared to correspond per-
fectly then-just for assurance which
seemed really needless-she called up the
ivyanomah and got harry bradford the
mate on the wire he said the shipmaster
had gone up the pier within ten minutes
after she left-intending to dine at one of
the clubs after attending to some business
on market street this tallied with the
statements in the note-there would have
been ample time for the accident the tak-
ing hiift out to copelys house and the
chauffeurs return to search for her it
was even likely that allen might have given
the names of two shops in which she was
known and might be found-inasmuch as
she had told him just where she was going

  all this of course takes much longer in
the telling than it did at the time look-
ing at the note from any angle it seemed
perfectly straight-and if joe allen were
really hurt too badly to clear his ship next
day he might have decided it would be the
safer course everything considered for her
to sail without him in that case he
would need a confidential interview with
her at once probably it was less than ten
minutes from the time she read the note
to the moment she stepped into the car and
was driven swiftly off down the monterey
road

there was apparently nothing to pre-
a vent claire averys stopping the car
anywhere along the road and getting out
had she decided to do so the windows
were open-other cars passing it seemed
farther than her estimate of the distance
and soon became too dark to distinguish
houses back from the road but eventually
they swung in between handsome gate-pil-
lars with lamps on them drove for several
minutes through a thick growth of ever-
greens and came to the porte-cochere of a
spacious bungalow which didnt seem to
be as well lighted as it would have been
with guests about the place saying he
supposed she would like to go up to see
the captain at once the chauffeur removed

his cap and led the way up a broad flight
of redwood stairs along a spacious hall and
threw open the door of a room lighted by
a single incandescent with a green shade

  before miss avery could fairly make out
the different objects in it the door was
quietly closed behind her-and locked
unquestionably securely locked there
were in the room a neat white-enameled
bed davenport chairs books on a table
roses in a bowl a bath adjoining-and
steel grilles at every window of beautiful
design highly decorative but hard enough
to resist any file or any human strength

  miss avery sat down removed her hat
picked up a book eventually there
would be food in all probability-and an
explanation meanwhile-the only satis-
faction she got out of the situation was
that her instinct had been right she was
securely trapped for the present

  in half an hour the door was unlocked
to admit a big chinaman who would have
scared most women speechless some ac-
cident of birth had twisted his features
until they were those of a demon rather
than a normal human being his eyes
were deep-set coal-black and piercing-
but taken by themselves gave a somewhat
better impression than the face the man
was clean enough-his clothes neat for
their type yet the whole effect was one
which would have given the average woman
a feeling of helpless terror-and miss
avery decided at first glance that the man
had been selected to wait upon her pur-
posely with such an idea in view as he
was laying out a tempting meal upon a
table near one of the windows she studied
him closely-then with a smile ventured
a few words in the cantonese dialect a
woman who manages the business of her
fathers schooner among the pacific islands
picks up a good bit of the samoan-
hawaiian dialects and runs across the
limit of grotesque hideousness in human
features when her trading sends her up
and down the china sea she acquires a
smattering of mandarin and cantonese as
easily-becomes accustomed to even more
nerve-jarring sights

  for a second or two the big chinks
face was orientally impassive then the
more expressive eyes glanced over her
speculatively when it was evident that
she had his close attention the girl sud-
denly flung out one hand at arms length
in a peculiar gesture-the fingers crooked
in a certain position
deep-water men

  now a chinaman rarely gets pale in-
stead of that the flesh of his face some-
times appears to get pasty-as if one might
dent it deeply with the end of a finger
presumably the man was thoroughly cold-
blooded-a machine to commit any sort
of atrocity which might be ordered-had
been a hatchet-man and worse-or else
he wouldnt be where he was in the cir-
cumstances but like most of his race he
was intensely superstitious devils were
living destructive forces to him and this
white woman not only knew his own
country but apparently moved in the most
powerful devil-society loyalty to his
wages and salt were all very well in the
case of soft weak females with throats to
be cut-but nothing had been said to him
about a devil-woman that was a dif-
ferent matter altogether for the sake of
his ancestors and his own bodily safety he
was entirely at the disposal of such a per-
son

zf course the plotters in the background
 had figured that she would react to the
chinks terrorizing appearance in the usual
feminine way and be in a receptive condi-
tion when one of them finally appeared to
interview her-instead of which she had
written a coded note to captain allen and
intrusted it to the chinaman apparently
without a doubt that it would be for-
warded as she had ordered and this calm
assurance that he dare not disobey her
clinched the young womans status in ling
fos mind the ordinary white-faced girl
would have feared him-screamed at his
approach but this handsome devil-
woman had given her orders with the air
of one who knows they cannot be disobeyed
under penalty of disaster to ones body and
torment to ones ancestors-then calmly
turned her back upon him all things con-
sidered he feared the mails were too slow
and managed to send the note by a fellow-
cantonese within an hour miss avery
knew it was a chance of course-but took
it with a good deal of confidence that her
note would reach joe allen and induce him
to sail without her-which was about the
last thing the gang expected him to do

  later in the evening a man whose strong
features seemed vaguely familiar came in
and sat down to chat with her as if she
were a guest in his house instead of a
prisoner he was courteous-not in the
least dictatorial-said that his own wishes
in regard to dealing with her had been

the blue

overruled by rougher business associates
who had determined to purchase a half-
interest in the platinum mine whose owner
she was known to represent he explained
that they were prepared to give her satis-
factory guarantees that they would pay as
high as a million for a half-interest if upon
examination by their engineers the matrix-
lode proved as rich as the sample which
they had seen would indicate-but that
they must know the location of the mine
and examine it for themselves in order
clearly to bring out what she was up
against claire pretended to more fear and
nervousness than she came anywhere near
feeling

  of course you know mr copely-if
thats your name-

  it isnt were using his house while
it is supposed to be closed during his
absence in europe the two caretakers
were induced to make a little extra money
on the side im smith-if you like
youre something a good deal more
than smith if i know anything about
physiognomy some day ill place you-
and see if a man can really get away with
this sort of thing however getting back
to the main question you know as well as
i do that i merely acted as shipping-agent
for the owner of that ore-selling it as or-
dered and that closed the transaction as
far as i and my steamer were concerned
we left singapore in ballast and made a
quick run to sydney-showing that there
was but one way in which that ore could
be put aboard of us-from junks-at sea
just where did they put it aboard of
you miss avery

  somewhere between singapore and syd-
ney figure it out for yourself

  smith threw up one hand in a gesture
of annoyance miss avery he said you
fail entirely to realize the position you are
in im doing my best to get you out of
this without bodily harm and with a
minimum of detention but the crowd
who are back of this affair are as cold-
blooded as an octopus they mean to get
what you know-or-

 yes or-what

  well-the mildest thing they talk of
doing is sending you out to an isolated
bungalow the other side of the foothills
with ling fo-alone

  an expression of horror came into the
girls face she was an excellent actress

  if you persist in defying them im
powerless were i seriously to interfere
theyd accuse me of intending to betray
them-my life wouldnt be worth ten cents
and-frankly-ive too many weighty in-
terests at stake to attempt anything quite
so heroic for a woman who is simply ob-
stinate and has it in her own hands to
walk out of this house about her own busi-
ness within an hour

  youre willing to have my life on your
hands rather than make an effort to save
me thats the sort of a man you are
is it of course id kill myself at the first
opportunity after reaching that bunga-
low 

  m-well-thats putting me in perhaps a
worse light than i really deserve miss
avery it is barely possible that we may
be able to work upon captain allens
fears for you sufficiently to get the infor-
mation from him i think hell give it
rather than have you subjected to any such
treatment hell know by noon that some-
thing has happened to you-and he wont
leave port until youre found

  i think you overrate my importance to
him or his shippers he must run his ship
according to his business agreements for
his cargo-some of which is perishable

  smith laughed-overconfidently as he
was afterward obliged to admit at the
time he would have gambled any reason-
able amount of money that joe allen
would no more leave san francisco know-
ing that she was in the hands of unscrupu-
lous scoundrels than she would have sailed
without him in a similar position had it
not been for the note which she smuggled
out by ling fo smith would have won his
bet-because his knowledge of human
nature and conviction as to a strong liking
between the two were not at fault it was
simply that both were playing a game far
bigger than their own personal interests
and were risking something at every step

a llen had come down the pier to his
 ship about six bells-finding at the
gangplank a well-dressed cantonese who
spoke fairly good english waiting for him
with claires note once assured that he
was captain allen himself the chinaman
disappeared before he had read it through
it took but a couple of minutes for allen
to grasp the fact of her abduction-and
sprint up the pier in record time but the
messenger was nowhere in sight the
watchman said he had crossed the street a

few seconds before-which was all the
satisfaction the shipmaster got as well
try to locate one particular flea on a big
dog after he had reread the note in his
own cabin to harry bradford and tom
harvey they were all three inclined to
disregard it and quietly set the whole po-
lice-force at work but gradually they
came around to the belief that the girl was
right and stood a good chance of outwitting
the gang of pirates-even securing much
valuable information if they did as she re-
quested the note was in a cipher which
claire and the captain had worked out to
be quickly read without a key and yet
completely baffle a casual reader who would
suppose it much more complicated than it
actually was translated it read

  dear joe

    they got me through a fake note stat-
  ing that you had been run over by a car
  and wanted to see me at once i tested it-
  two ways-seemed perfectly straight of
  course theyre using pretty nasty threats to
  force information out of me

    just by luck they tried to scare me with
  a frightful-looking chink who has more anx-
  iety about what i may do to his ancestors
  than keeping his job barring accidents if i
  lose my nerve hell obey my orders at every
  turn-which is something

    they expect you to hold up the ship and
  search for me if you do they are likely to
  get you also or force your hand with threats
  concerning me if you clear as intended im
  fairly sure it will disarrange their plans a
  whole lot because theyre not expecting you
  to do anything of the sort and wont have
  any boat of their own ready to chase you
  on the jump so if you pass the farralones
  before theyre in sight they wont get a
  glimpse of you all the way across theyll
  calculate your time into manila pretty closely
  -probably arrange to get there four or five
  days later-before you can load and be off
  again after discharging

    my impression is that if you let the news-
  papers get hold of my abduction-make quite
  a story of it without any apparent explana-
  tion-it will make other parties who may be
  on our track think that youll never dream
  of looking for any business out of the usual
  run until im found you can make manila
  at least three days quicker than anyone sup-
  poses-set down in the log that you were
  making a test-run with picked coal under
  exceptionably favorable conditions capn
  jennings can be fixing a part-cargo in the
  right direction while youre at sea-so that
  you can be out of manila before this crowd
  reaches there catch the idea

    never mind about me ill probably find
  out a lot before they get through with me-
  and unless a streak of unexpected bad luck
  happens along i think i can get loose when
  it begins to look as though id better if i
  get a chance will communicate by radio

the mate and the engineer were inclined

	to minimize the danger which miss
avery might be running in the hands of
her captors the fact that she had suc-
ceeded in getting her note through to the
captain and appeared to have been treated
well up to that time indicated as they
thought that whoever had abducted her
would have too wholesome a respect for
criminal punishment to do her bodily harm
on the other hand her being in their power
seemed to offer a better chance to run an-
other cargo of the ore than they had really
expected to get for some months-from
the fact that her captors would never think
of the captains risking it on his own
responsibility without her but allen
knew the seriousness of the game better
than they did

  it probably does give us some chance
of running another cargo after we leave
manila-provided those cowards who have
miss avery happen to represent a combina-
tion of the onl parties who are making a
serious effort to run us down and discover
the location of that mine but we cant
safely assume anything of the sort that
sydney smelting company want to keep a
good thing for themselves sufficiently to use
every effort toward preventing any knowl-
edge of the ore from leaking out theyre
equally certain however to have one or
more agents of their own shadowing us even
if the men have no idea of just why they
are doing it

  now suppose that some one else with
access to their plant happened to get hold
of a sample and tested it-knowing the
source from which the company got it
that would make at least two different
parties on our trail the companys own
agents might be cautioned against getting
caught in anything really outside the law-
though i think both manners and sladen
have nerve enough to take a chance for
what they know there is in this proposi-
tion but the possible outsiders wouldnt
be influenced by any scruples at all if
they know the amount paid for that part-
cargo of ore-and they undoubtedly would
if they know anything at all about the
stuff-they wont even stop at murder
theyll have no more mercy on claire
avery than they would on a cat which had
something of value to them inside of her
in spite of her letter im going to stay
here until i run those brutes down and
get her out of their clutches

  i think youre wrong and shes right

capn first place shes sized up the
proposition just about as i do-youll be
a darned sight more likely to wind up in
their clutches yourself than you will to
locate and get her out of them perhaps
youd be lucky enough or smart enough
not to-but say they do get you that
puts the two of you in the gangs hands-
and well suppose this lot to be the more
determined unscrupulous one now imagine
yourself securely bound to something solid
watching them do things to her right be-
fore your eyes see if it were a case
of you alone blabbing youd tell em to
go to hell and cut the liver out of you
but if you saw em trying it on her-and
couldnt do a thing-youd weaken inside
of a minute any of us would

  suppose on the other hand you clear
the boat as she wishes and let capn jen-
nings do the chasing of those brutes while
we are on our way he likes her a lot-
hell see red when he hears about this-
and hes got a lot of influence both with
the city government and the federal ad-
ministration he might even get a detail
of doughboys from presidio to work on
the quiet while the city police are tracing
her in their own way if the wyanomah
unexpectedly gets away to sea before they
can follow her with some faster boat itll
make em damn careful what they do to
miss avery if they maltreated her use-
lessly when the key to the whole proposi-
tion was chasing after us they not only
wouldnt gain anything by it but thered
be a good deal less mercy shown them if
or when they are caught seems to me
the safest thing for miss claire is to do
exactly as she says

eventually allen came around to
- their belief-though he felt sick all
through at the idea of leaving claire in
such a position they were at breakfast
next morning when a note was put aboard
by some messenger who got away before
there seemed any reason for detaining him
this communication was expressed in
courteous terms by a person of education
but its grim purport was none the less
clear miss avery was being detained
by certain interests who were determined
to purchase a half-interest in the mine
whose owner she represented she was in
a place secure enough to make any search
for her useless and would be treated with
consideration if she gave them the location
of the mine within a reasonable time if
book magazine

unfortunately she remained foolishly ob-
stinate the interests would be regrettably
obliged to use pressure in the circum-
stances captain allen must use his own
judgment based upon his knowledge of her
as to whether it might be advisable for him
to remain a week or more in port-or
whether if there seemed to be nothing
gained by waiting he should clear at once
as intended

  the shipmasters immediate reaction to
this note was both as the writer had an-
ticipated-and very much otherwise allen
was seen motoring furiously to the offices
of the jennings shipping  navigation
company-then with captain jennings to
call upon the police commissioner after
that by cable-car and on foot he cleared
his ship at the customhouse in his usual
businesslike way-and the wyanomali was
actually steaming out through the golden
gate before the interests wexe convinced
that he had really done so

at two oclock there was a hurried coun-
cil-of-war in the corner room of cor-
belstons office-suite between the financier
jones wohlberg and two other men who
had been taken into the game as com-
petent executives corbelston had seen too
many propositions of all sorts-been
through too many risky adventures-to get
much excited over a serious reverse when
one happened to disarrange his plans his
voice was quiet-he seemed to be enjoying
his cigar but if he had lost one trick he
meant to take the next one he wasnt
playing for marbles either

  after wed finished breakfast this morn-
ing out at the copely place id about de-
cided to pull out and quit i dont pretend
to know so very much about women-but
im pretty well satisfied that well get noth-
ing from that girl and she has a perfect
horror of ling fo too makes her faint
even to look at him if im any judge of
expression and nervous reaction of course
we can try going the limit with her-but
if we do and get nothing were not only
where we started as far as she is con-
cerned but were up against conviction for
murder if the police run us down shell
kill herself and her friends wont let up
until they get us the only thing which
made me hesitate was the chance that we
might get captain allen too while he was
searching the city for her it never oc-
curred to me that he would actually sail
and leave her in any such position here-

by culpeper zandtt

not one man in ten thousand would have
done it and i figured that by working
upon the fears of each for the other we
might get somewhere

  well-allens clearing his ship and get-
ting to sea in the circumstances puts an-
other face upon the matter altogether so
far ive been interested in this game of
jones and wohlbergs as a gamble with
some chance of potting half a million if
we were lucky-perhaps a bit more and
the thing began to look as though our
chances were poor unless we got in deeper
and took more serious risks than it was
really worth  but now-im plumb in-
terested im going to sit in this game to
win if that girl will actually risk being
alone with ling fo in a mountain shack
rather than tell us what she knows-and
this shipmaster allen will risk leaving her
in our hands with all which that implies-
the game is far bigger than any of us have
dreamed its not a matter of half a mil-
lion but of twenty-thirty-fifty millions
unless its absolutely necessary with rea-
sonable prospect of her weakening i wont
stand for doing that girl any real harm
ive too much to lose personally by get-
ting implicated in anything of the sort-
otherwise of course she or what happens
to her are of no interest to me

  but-hell what can we do now if
she doesnt come across allen and his
ship are out of sight by this time-at sea 
well-they can be followed if we get
busy at once we can clear the llangow
city and be outside point lobos by sun-
set according to capn wohlbergs esti-
mate of the wyanomahs engines our boat
should have the edge on her by a good four
knots-overhaul her in forty-eight hours if
she sticks to a straight course for manila-
aye-but suppose allen doesnt hell
save time and coal by a great circle course
-making his southing off japan-differ-
ence of close upon two days in the run 
we dont really care much either way
theyll post the wyanomah on the black-
board at the maritime exchange as being
due in manila on a certain date-knowing
better than we do how long she ought to
take at sea we may fairly assume i
think that the platinum mine is not upon
any of the pacific islands-inasmuch as
that boat picked up the ore somewhere be-
tween singapore and sydney she hasnt
a single ton of space for it until after she
discharges at manila so all we have to
do is to make manila about the same time
deep-water men



or possibly a day ahead of her even if
she beats us a couple of days she wont be
discharged and loaded again

  didnt you say you could have char-
tered an eight-hundred-ton seagoing yacht
for a little less than you got the llangow
city mr corbelston why wouldnt she
have been a better craft for the sort of
chasing and cruising were likely to do
cost more to run her-attract too much
attention wherever we went-too easy to
spot and start gossip in different ports
on the other hand a modern tramp like
the llangow city under u s registry
getting no business at the freights she has
to charge might easily pass through the
hands of six or eight different owners-
be put under european registry again-be
sent from one port to another in ballast
for delivery-be chartered on short time or
for a single voyage-pick up a little busi-
ness here and there during these changes
of ownership-and attract no attention
whatever to the six or eight men who hap-
pen to be aboard in addition to her crew
also-shell carry that ore when we get it
i went over all this before chartering her

  well-ill leave word in my offices that
ive been suddenly called to the east-
then get aboard the tramp from some
launch on the side away from the pier
before the last coal-barge hauls away
meanwhile capn wohlberg will clear her
and gurney will either get some guarantee
from the girl that shell go aboard without
making any disturbance-face pretty well
covered-or else drug her and come down
in an ambulance with a sick woman
dont do that however unless you have to
its too risky with the police combing the
city for her my impression is that shell
go with us willingly-particularly when
she knows weve cleared for manila and
are proceeding there direct i foresaw the
possibility of having to bring her along
and have had men fitting up a stateroom
on the hurricane-deck just under the wheel-
house also ive signed on a well-recom-
mended steward and stewardess well
take a gang of fifteen or twenty husky
scrappers from longshore with us-and a
couple of machine-guns just in case we
locate that mine within the next few
months but well berth them aft under
the turtle-deck-away from the crew and
where theyll have no business in the mid-
ship-house at all with that outfit we
can go most anywhere and do pretty
nearly anything now-if youve got the

the blue

layout thoroughly in mind lets go get

busy

puring the twenty-four hours claire
avery had been materially strengthen-
ing her influence over ling fo in a way
that was entirely psychological and which
she artistically worked for all it was worth
the big demoniac chinaman had been
given to understand by corbelston-as the
supposed copely-and his companions
that they had a young woman in their
power from whom they meant to get cer-
tain information in one way or another-
no matter how far they had to go with
her his natural inference based upon
oriental methods in such cases was that
they were dealing with a female already
frightened out of her senses and that either
they would turn her over to him as a play-
thing or order her throat cut to get rid of
her after getting the information they
wanted when she laughed at him-look-
ing into those fathomless eyes which were
not so bad as his face without the least
evidence of fear-and proved herself the
possessor of knowledge supposedly given
only to those upon intimate terms with both
gods and devils he was convinced that a
mistake had been made somewhere so
he closely watched her bearing with the
supposed copely-smith and gurney who
was brought in to attempt a little third-
degree

  had she weakened with either of them
he would have begun to distrust the extent
of her power for evil or good in his own
case but she appeared to be laughing at
them also-answering their questions and
accusations with a simple innocence which
the chinaman saw with a quiet grin of
his own was simply playing with them
fencing telling nothing they wanted to
know so being apparently in their power
to kill or abuse in any way they chose if
she actually was so little afraid of them
as to smilingly defy the worst they could
do it was manifestly probable that she
could have some willing devil strike them
dead with black magic at any moment she
wished to do so and thinking of cer-
tain stuff in little teakwood boxes concealed
in secret pockets of his quilted jacket ling
fo rather hoped for selection as that
willing devil himself upon occasion he
was entirely at her service-it could be
quite easily done and no great bobbery
about it if the bodies were properly made
away with
book magazine

  when it appeared that she had nothing
of this sort in mind for the present ling
fos respect increased if anything she
would use the fools for purposes of her
own it seemed-when they supposed her
in their power the artistic finesse of this
appealed to him all in her own good
time decidedly this was admirable in
the serving of such a one there was much
to be learned when he found that they
were to make a journey at sea in the gen-
eral direction of his own country and that
the woman was to accompany them quite
willingly the oblique mind of him grinned
while his face remained impassive this
was getting to be more and more a joke
which none but the oriental brain could
thoroughly appreciate it was conveyed
to him in simple but forcible language that
the woman would be more or less in his
charge-that he was to look after an-
ticipate her wants tempt her appetite with
his choicest cooking-but that under risk
of sudden death he was to see that no harm
came to her from anyone this mind
you from the very employers who at first
pretended indifference as to whether her
throat was cut or anything else that might
happen to her hmph they had been
as putty in her hands

when he first heard of the eighteen
roughnecks who were to be quartered
aft upon the same boat it presented an-
other aspect of the affair handling three
or four men with brains enough to con-
sider their own safety was a different prop-
osition from controlling a dozen and a half
beachcombers who were likely to be fairly
primed with hard liquor and oblivious to
personal danger for that reason but if
for example ling were to constitute him-
self assistant steward as would be the nat-
ural selection aboard the tramp it would
be among his duties to carry meals aft
from the galley to this bunch of driftwood
under the turtle-deck and if the woman
considered it advisable to so order it any
time he would provide himself with more
little teakwood boxes of different sorts to
be used in connection with the food-the
contents of some producing wholesale obliv-
ion for many hours while others made the
effect unanimous and permanent all
things considered ling fo went aboard
that afternoon with no misgivings either for
himself or his devil-woman-who seemed
equally satisfied with the course matters
were taking and as they rounded point

by culpeper zandtt



lobos the evening papers were out with
big headlines concerning a handsome girl
well-known in shipping circles as the char-
terer and supercargo of a nine-thousand-
ton steamer who had been mysteriously
abducted for no apparent reason-who was
being diligently searched for both by the
city police and army-details from presidio
it was rumored that international compli-
cations might be mixed up in the case

  corbelstons private secretary had been
told that he could be reached by radio--
and paid over a hundred dollars to have
the gist of the news broadcasted the
operator on the llangow city-corbelston
himself happened to be the only man
aboard who could adjust a regenerative set
and use continental-picked this up as
it came noticing with surprise and much
satisfaction that no hint of their real game
had been even suggested in relation to the
girls abduction so far it seemed the ef-
forts of the various conflicting interests
to locate the mysterious mine had been
leak-proof

in the mess-saloon that evening miss

	avery saw jones and wohlberg for the
first time since her abduction as they
had not been on the deck of the wyano-
mah for over five minutes before getting
into the boat which transferred them to the
wool-steamer and had presented a pretty
tough appearance after their thirty-six
hours in the hold they didnt suppose she
would recognize them for a few minutes
she didnt-couldnt place them in spite of
the something familiar in their faces then
wohlberg scowled in a peculiar way and it
instantly recalled the look on his face after
allen had knocked him down she smiled
in frank good humor-and renewed the ac-
quaintance

  ive been unable to guess why i was
abducted and what all this was about but
of course if you two are in it that explains
a lot-though why you should bear any ill-
will toward me i dont know how did
you manage to get off that wool-boat we
understood her master to say he was short-
handed and would be glad to work you as
far as london anyway

wohlberg scowled in a peculiar way and it
-merely glowered at her across the table
but jones had gotten more of his rough
edges polished off and for that reason
was perhaps the more dangerous of the two
because it enabled him to keep his real in-
tentions entirely under cover corbelston

was presumably another passenger like
herself-yet in a few moments she sensed
the air of command which indicated him as
the man in supreme authority from his
manner she judged that he was fully aware
of the risk to all of them if they ill-treated
her-that it was his intention to be as
courteous as circumstances permitted
again the impression crossed her mind
that he was really a person of social prom-
inence-well-known in california the
difficulty would be to prove such a mans
identity with this gentlemanly pirate who
was certainly breaking the laws in her case
and presumably in others

c rom her stateroom she once or twice

	caught the snapping of a radio-spark
which seemed to be just overhead in the
masters cabin abaft the wheelhouse she
knew that corbelston had appropriated this
for himself and thought it likely that there
would not be space enough up there for
the more bulky parts of the outfit-either a
large storage-battery or a small automatic
dynamo controlled from above in such
a case these would be possibly in a store-
room adjoining hers so at first oppor-
tunity she had ling fo get her a small
electric torch and a pair of pliers the
serviceable automatic which she had been
wearing concealed in her clothes of
course hadnt been discovered

   feeling practically certain that corbel-
ston-the supposed smith-wouldnt go
into this storeroom unless looking for
trouble in his outfit or have jones overhaul
it unless necessary she managed to pick
the lock and slip in there during the night-
watch unobserved to make a thorough ex-
amination as she had thought likely
there were a number of the smaller parts in
duplicate spares-in the way of wire
switches extra batteries keys head-frames
with ear-receivers spark-coils condensers
and so forth the connections from the
masters cabin were led down through a
couple of three-inch iron tubes-there was
even a manhole plate in the deck which
permitted access to the storeroom and its
various parts of the outfit in case of mutiny
or other trouble aboaed as nearly as she
could judge this manhole cover was under
the chart-desk on the side opposite corbel-
stons berth and she found that by stand-
ing on top of the dynamo she could
manage to push it up at any time she
wished hauling herself up through it was
a more difficult matter-but it was possible

the blue

at a time when smith was playing
cards with the other men in the mess-
saloon within thirty feet of her she took
the chance of going into the storeroom
bolting the door putting a wooden box on
top of the dynamo and actually getting up
into the cabin above drawing the blinds
so that no reflection from her torch could
be seen from the bridge she examined the
wires leading up to the antennae and found
a place where a branch-loop could be
spliced in on them without being discov-
ered unless a careful search were made
then letting herself down into the store-
room again she sawed an opening in the
bulkhead through which she crawled into
the space under the berth in her own state-
room

  as ling fo had charge of its cleaning
and bed-making the steamer-trunk contain-
ing an outfit of clothing hastily purchased
for her offered all the concealment neces-
sary when shoved under her berth on
the other side an empty wooden box was
placed against the hole she was now in
position to make her next moves with more
leisure and less chance of being caught at
them-as every signal over the aerials
passed through her branch-loop and she
could cut-in with her switch at any time
having access to the storeroom without the
risk of going in from the gangway

  having handled a battery-set for her
father on the old trading-schooner she was
a competent amateur electrician and had
kept up with recent developments of the
regenerative telephone-sets so that with
anything as comparatively simple as a spark
and code outfit she had little difficulty in
rigging up a pony transmitting buzzer and
key-from a spark-coil and two cells of
battery-which was weak enough to sound
as though it were coming from distance
when corbelston had the receivers over his
ears in the cabin above an experienced
operator might have detected something
about the strength of the signals which
would have started him investigating but
to corbelston there seemed to be nothing
at all out of the way with them when she
cut in and asked him to relay a message
to some other steamer that night

the other men hadnt considered that
 there would be anything more they
could do on the voyage across the pacific
than get to manila about the time the wya-
nomali did and start the real chase from
there but corbelston was now in the


book magazine



game to win and was using his head he
had a confidential agent in most of the ori-
ental ports with whom he used a private
code for more particular communications

so he began on the second day out to ad-
vise his manila man that he wanted con-
fidential information concerning all cargo
offering there for australian or oriental
ports-and received messages two or three
times each day upon this subject half
way across he was amazed to hear that
the wyanomah was expected within forty-
eight hours-having made a test-run with
picked coal over the northern or great
circle course-and that a part-cargo of
hemp and tobacco for brisbane had been
fixed for her by the jennings agents there

if this information had any basis of truth
corbelston knew that he must have been
misled upon some of jones or wohlbergs
data-and put it squarely up to them

  didnt one or both of you tell me the
wyanomah couldnt do better than fourteen
-usually logged around thirteen

  aye sir down to her plimsoll shell
not do thirteen 

  well youre crazy in the head i reckon
shell be in manila within forty-eight
hours-been making a test-run with picked
coal-northern course and shes got a
part-cargo fixed for brisbane

  did you get that by radio well-its
a lie its not in her to do it in the time

i listened to her engines through that bulk-
head for two days an they were shovin
her-we could tell by the way she was
buckin into them head-seas countin the
revolutions-knowin the size an pitch of
her screw-its not difficlt to figure her
average speed turn up lloyds regis-
ter-youll find her rated twelve-and-a
half

  h-m-m-youve pretty good reasons
for your belief--but ive a hunch that
youre wrong all the same that boat
must have a good four knots in reserve
anyhow-say the report is correct
what would you suggest

  if the report is right-which it just
cant be-alienll be loaded an outa ma-
nila at least a day before we get there
going to brisbane his course is down
through gilolo passage and torres straits
-if he goes direct by changin our
course right now we could probly reach
gilolo a bit ahead of him got any agents
in those waters thatd be likely to hear of
his being spoken

by culpeper zandtt

  one at iloilo-one at zamboanga-and
the one in manila

  the manila one might pick up rumors
at the maritime exchange tell him to let
you know the minute any other craft
speaks or sees the wyanomah hes got
agents of his own who can watch for her
corbelston did this at once and changed
his course to make the gilolo passage
claire avery did some concentrated think-
ing she first ordered ling fo to put
something in the pseudo smiths cock-
tails which would keep him dead to the
world until the next morning at least-and
when the chink brought word that the
man couldnt keep his eyes open ten
minutes longer she crept up through the
manhole into his room-examined him
carefully to see if he were really uncon-
scious-bolted the door and sat down at the
radio-outfit to send out her code-call for
the wyanomah in half an hour she got
an acknowledgment from allen himself
who instantly recognized her sending she
gave him the main points of corbelstons
plans so that allen might easily avoid
being spoken at sea

ctve days later she talked to corbelston

	in the room above with her pony set
-saying the wyanomah had been sighted
and spoken off sandakan north borneo
apparently bound macassar way-but
botched the signature so that he couldnt
tell which of his agents supposedly talked
with him he changed his course for
borneo but got no other report of any-
one sighting his quarry-went  miles
out of his way on a fools errand while
allen was safely taking aboard another
lot of ore at the mysterious mine on lajoe
koera-loafed around torres straits for a
week-then read in the maritime reports
that the steamer wyanomah allen mas-
ter was discharging at brisbane and pro-
ceeding from there with a part-cargo for
the big smelting and refining company in
sydney when he got back aboard the
llangow city with his news he found that
miss avery had somehow managed to get
ashore at thursday island during the
night and knew that she would go to the
british resident with the story of her ab-
duction as soon as she could see him cor-
belston didnt even wait to get his anchor
up-cut the cable and steamed off down
the straits at the best gait the deceptive-
looking tramp had in reserve

  a t least twice a year when he came in
  to stovepipe springs to get his mail

	v and flour sagebrush answered to
the cognomen of george beam this was
one of the occasions to his acute con-
sternation he had discovered that the
springs was crowded with life and gayety
for there was a strange female stopping at
the hotel and another pilgrim was coming
in by stage this same afternoon

  sagebrush presented a general vista of
whiskers red nose and nondescript gar-
ments bleached by sun and white with al-
kali dust yet it was his proud boast that
he was the only man between death valley
and the big bend of the colorado who kept
abreast of the times subscribing to sev-
eral weekly magazines he came in once
every six months to get the accumulated
copies then he sat down and answered
the advertisements requesting circulars
thus he had a burro-load of magazines to
read for six months then a burro-load of
circulars wherewith to while away the next
six months-an involved and vicious circle
in which sagebrush was always trying to
catch up with himself he kept the post
office on the map however

  now dog-gone it he observed to his
three patient burros as he tied on his grub
and magazines and a bundle of postal
cards you and me got to hike out again
in order to git our correspondence goin in
peace dad blame this dad-blamed town
what in hell is folks crowding in this coun-
try for anyhow

  haywire johnson assistant postmaster
and general utility man about the hotel
showed up in time to answer this query

  hi sagebrush aint you stoppin over
in town things is pickin up right fast
we got a settler yesterday and we got a
tourist cornin today

  thats jest it growled sagebrush a
feller cant have no peace no more that

  sagebrush grunted hitched his three bur-
ros to the rail and vanished in the hotel

fvnce stovepipe springs had been a
boom mining town but now it was dead
and dried out to west and north lay
desert to the south lay more desert and the
colorado to the east was the chuckwalla
range-in it and beyond it rich cattle
country with water galore here in stove-
pipe springs and over across the chuckwal-
las men talked different languages had
different customs and were themselves dif-
ferent no cow-men came over this way
unless they were well ahead of the sheriff
and stovepipe springs having its own rail-
road connections at a distance of twenty
miles was supremely independent of the
remainder of the county and heartily de-
spised all ranchers and cow-men

  here besides the hotel were five inhab-
ited houses and two stores a bank and a
garage had it not been for the literary
enterprise of sagebrush beam even the
post office would have long since been wiped
off the map the town was a point of call
for desert rats and being at present on a
detour of the cross-continent automobile

  highway had more business than its looks
would warrant its inhabitants lived only
for the day when some one would strike it
rich and bring back the boom

  it was three in the afternoon and blazing
hot when the exhaust whistle of the auto-
stage announced its arrival the entire
dozen persons of the local constituency
gathered to watch one of these onlookers
was a small man in rusty and dilapidated
attire he stood barely five feet six his
face was a grayish mask from which shone
two bright and glittery gray eyes and
there was a stoop to his shoulders-but he
was not crowded he was not only the
most flourishing but he was the most re-
spected citizen of all chuckwalla county

  the stage whooped out a final whistle
and came to rest amid a whirl of dust in
front of the hotel the driver flung off
a mail-sack handed off an empty express-
box then swung down and vanished
abruptly into the hotel his solitary pas-
senger meantime descended before the as-
sembled gaze of stovepipe springs staring
around with unassumed interest and
stovepipe springs after the first gasp
stared back-hard


cactus and rattlers

the pilgrim was apparently a young
man though little could be seen of his
features he wore an enormous pith hel-
met which shaded his face tinted yellow
goggles which hid his eyes and from the
collar of his khaki coat to the tip of his nose
was wound a bright green shawl which
draped back over his shoulder just then
haywire and sagebrush came out the side
door of the hotel and sagebrush halted as
though smitten

my gosh haywire he exclaimed
what was in that there licker i never
seen nothing like this before-not even from
tequila is that thing really there

  she is said haywire with a startled
look wait-its goin to talk

  the arrival had unwound the green
shawl to disclose a mouth and chin which
were certainly square-cut enough for any-
one he glanced around the circle of star-
ing faces and his goggles fastened upon the
little man in rusty attire toward him
the newcomer stepped met the glittery gray
eyes and spoke

  am i correct in assuming that this is
stovepipe springs he asked

  yep returned the small man curtly
excellent an admirable spot i am
percival henry j tompkins a humble
member of the american society of mam-
malogists in search of material for a paper
on the fauna of the great american desert
mr tompkins spoke in a precise neatly
clipped voice i seek a temporary domi-
cile here-

  git over to mormon wells then
snapped the small man

  you misapprehend my meaning said
mr tompkins patiently i seek rooms at
your hotel and a guide i want a man
who knows the desert who can lead me to
the haunts of its creatures particularly i
desire to study the habits of the crotalus
cerastes

  with a flick of his shoulders the small
man turned as though to leave mr tomp-
kins reached out and laid a restraining
hand on his shoulder unwarned by the
gasp from those near by

  my dear sir i am addressing you-
what happened was startling to see
the little man moved with a swiftness that
the eye could not follow then stood snarl-
ing his gray mask of a face glittering with
sheer malignity tompkins knocked
sprawling half across the road rolled over
sat up and then struggled to his feet he
stood blinking around

the blue



  that-er-that was a most remarkable
thing he exclaimed in his precise tones
did somebody run into me

  with a sneer  and a snap of his teeth
the little man turned and departed toward
the bank which he owned haywire drew
the old desert rat hastily aside

  look out sidewinders feelin mean
today him and that female woman have
been talkin chicken-ranches i reckon oh
my gosh now that there mistake for a
human is headin this-a-way-

  mr tompkins indeed seemed to sense
a general lack of cordiality all around him
except in the gaping countenance of sage-
brush whom he now approached

  my friend-

  pilgrim dont bother me said sage-
brush defensively it jest cant be true
ill pay three dollars a day to a man
who knows the desert

  sagebrush changed countenance so did
the remainder of stovepipe springs there
was a general forward movement but the
desert rat was the first to recover voice

  youre done pilgrim youre sure en-
gaged what was it you wanted to find
crotalus cerastes undoubtedly you
can introduce me to specimens

  sagebrush swallowed hard but had a
reputation to sustain and upheld it nobly

  you bet he announced promptly
lots o them specimens up around marble
canon and over by lost waterhole ive
seen em so thick you couldnt hardly move
without steppin on em ill take you right
where them things breed perfesser

  the perfesser looked slightly startled
but nodded assent

  very well you are engaged we shall
have to hire an automobile

  you got to see sidewinder crowfoot
about that he owns em all

  very well come to my room in an
hour when i have had a chance to remove
the stains of travel by the way where is
the hotel i wrote to engage rooms but
see no hostelry

  right yere under your nose perfesser
hassayamp is takin in the mail-thar he is
-hey hassayamp meet my friend the
perfesser this is hassayamp foster per-
fesser the perfessers a bug-hunter has-

  with bath said tompkins hassa-
yamp halted and blinked

  bath good gosh we dont allow no
washin in the springs this time o year
got to use a cream separator to git enough
drinkin water rains are over but they
aint filled the springs yet-not for another
two weeks i reckon

  i refer sir to a bathroom attached
explained tompkins

   well there aint none said hassayamp
whars your grips

  two enormous and bulging suitcases
each as big as a small trunk were inlhe
stage boot and hassayamp hauled them
out with antagonistic air and led his vic-
tim away

ryhe stovepipe house was built for desert
use not for looks the front building
contained post office and hotel dining-room
and passing through this tompkins de-
scended the rear steps and found two long
adobe structures stretching in front of him
each divided into cells between them
drooped some parched flowers and shrubs
he was shown to his cell a room twelve by
twelve furnished with all the comforts of
home

  dont do no cussing nor singing after
midnight warned hassayamp as he shoved
in the two enormous grips  cause a ladys
got the next room when the bell rings
for supper you show up prompt my old
womans liable to be real ornery if folks
dont predate hot vittles two-fifty a day
what did you go tangle up with that old
desert rat sagebrush for id ha been glad
to pilot you around my own self intrested
in mines are you dont let him show you
no specimens puffesser that old rascal
would salt hell and unload it on a pilgrim
dont you trust nobody around here but
me i got two quartz lodes and a placer
location thatll make your eyes water-
not interested in mines thanks said
tompkins cutting short the flow of talk
if i saw a good chicken-ranch i might
invest but not otherwise ever hear of
anyone around these parts by the name of
ramsay alec ramsay might have
passed through here a year or so ago
nope said hassayamp shaking his
mustaches well if ye want anything
come and holler for it

  hassayamp withdrew in more haste than
he had previously displayed he ducked
around the side of the hotel rambled down
the desert sands of the nominal alley and

in three minutes was rapping sharply at the
back door of the adobe bank this was
opened to him by the small gray-faced man
who was no other than sidewinder crow-
foot hassayamp slid inside and closed the
door behind him

  well rasped sidewinder whats
up

  that bug-hunter said hassayamp
agitatedly what ye think he said that
if he knowed where there was a good chick-
en-ranch he might buy it

   a thin smile appeared in the gray mask
   that so well see about it

  and he asked if i knowed anyone
around here a year back name of alec
ramsay

  the smaller man started and his eyes
glittered venomously

  so thats it-so thats it murmured
sidewinder i thought he didnt act right
natural by gosh ill look into him
want ramsay the one began has-
sayamp that bought that there claim from
mesquite up in pinecate canon and got
mixed up with-

  shut up snapped the other man sud-
denly listen to me now ill attend to
this gent myself if he needs it let him
run as fars his hobbles will let for a while
first we got to fix up miss gilman you
got to take her out day after tomorrow-
sabe ill have her all primed up about the
location-you sell it to her take her up
the chuckwalla road then off to pinecate
mesa and up the canon to that big boulder
sell her the same ground we sold that ram-
say fool thered ought to be water in it
right now and itll look mighty pretty
sell her any location she picks out sabe
all right said hassayamp and ye
neednt worry much over that bug-hunter
hes jest a natural-born fool

  maybe was the response but dont
be too durned sure

  idewinders doubts would have
been verified could he have seen profes-
sor tompkins at the same moment tomp-
kins had removed goggles and helmet
reveal snapping blue eyes which loc
anything but weak and close-cropped
hair that spelled trouble also from
neath his shirt he had produced an aui
matic pistol and was now careful
examining its load when he spoke to
himself his voice lacked all the precision
and clipped utterance it had displayed in
public

  confound it theres one thing i sure
overlooked he was musing as he frowned
at a silver plate set into the butt of the
pistol if i take it off dust will get into
everything if i leave it on im running
risks well guess ill run risks if i need
you my friend ill sure need you real bad
the initials on the silver plate were

imagination could be made to fit the name

chapter ii

the usually free-and-easy dining-room
of the stovepipe house was hushed and
uneasy when supper came around before
the unwonted presence of a strange female
tompkins had a table to himself and at
the next table was miss gilman there
were only two other occupied tables

  tompkins was interested in his fellow-
plgrim she was a young woman she was
possessed of an indoor complexion and if
not exactly beautiful she had an air of
character and firmness when she smiled
indeed as she did whenever haywire came
to her table with his tray a dancing light
came into her eyes and haywire was
straightway confused and flustered seated
with his wife at another table was has-
sayamp and tompkins observed that the
proprietor addressed his better half in a
tone of voice intended to reach other ears

  marier we got to improve on manuelas
cookin fore next week when them road-
workmen git here i aint stuck on mex
cookin my own self well be right
crowded up with folks workin on the high-
way next week mose pincus tells me to-
day theres a feller name o rosenblum
cornin in from meteorite goin to open up
a army goods store for this here district

kids and a missus and a store front

springs chamber o commerce id say this

-art o dust today too wouldnt sprise
 a mite if a rushd start this way thatd
-jde gold hills a mile dang it i wisht
c didnt have to ship in these here aigs
somehow they dont taste like aigs should
as i remember em

  miss gilman departed and thereafter
hassayamp essayed no more information at
large tompkins who was decidedly hun-

gry was the last out of the dining-room
he came through the post office lobby per-
formed the delayed ceremony of registering
and was then escorted outside to the street
by hassayamp they found miss gilman
standing under the tin sun-shade and look-
ing up at the glorious sunset that flooded
all the sky with gold and scarlet she
turned at their approach and hassayamp
performed the introductions

  miss ethel gilman lemme make you
acquainted with the puffesser you folks
want to make yourselves to home in stove-
pipe springs we dont put on no airs
here and everybodys sociable miss gil-
man she figgers on startin a chicken-ranch
and settlin in our midst and i dunno but
what we might make her our school-teacher
this time next week wed ought to have
six rosenblums and we got four little
garcias right now and manuela tells me
her brother is liable to come over from
chuckwalla city next month and hes got
five more that looks right healthy dont
it then take the old alcora dance hall
down the street itd make a right smart
school if we fix her up and spill a little
paint around and so forth the puffesser
is likewise intrested in hen chickens miss
gilman hes lookin up bugs right now
but-what did you say your name was
perfesser

  tompkins cleared his throat and bowed
to the young woman

  percival henry j tompkins entirely
at your service madam may i solicit the
pleasure of your company in a short walk
to breathe the inspiring evening air and
view the noble aspect of the creators
handiwork in the heavens

  gosh murmured hassayamp in awe
miss gilman gave tompkins a curious
glance as though wishing to peer past those
tinted goggles a smile was in her eyes as
she made demure assent

  thank you id enjoy showing you the
sights you just arrived today

  only this afternoon madam returned
tompkins mr foster if you apprehend
any specimens of crotalus cerastes in the
near future i should be glad if you would
confine and preserve them for me

  id sure like to puffesser said has-
sayamp blinking but we aint got a bug
in the house if you was to go up to
garcias you might have some luck
tompkins waved his hand and strode
off beside miss gilman who seemed rather
red in the face

either of them broke the silence

 they passed down the street came to
the fast-disappearing rows of ancient build-
ings relics of boom days and presently
were walking along the open desert follow-
ing the white road that went straight as a
die across the horizon the silence be-
came oppressive until suddenly tompkins
chuckled and spoke in his natural voice it
was a drawling rather whimsical voice and
drew a swift glance from the girl

  our friend hassayamp is a human
phonograph he said

  youll go too far one of these days
said miss gilman tompkins stopped
short and stared at her

  eh just what do you mean

  nonsense exclaimed the girl sharply
yet with a laugh in her eyes that red
hair and your natural voice and the shape
of your head dont go with your assumed
character mr tompkins take off those
glasses and let me see what you look like
and stop fidgeting with that pipe in your
pocket take it out and smoke id like
you to

  tompkins broke into a laugh reached
up and removed the goggles and met the
curious regard of miss gilman

  what do you wear them for she de-
manded you look better without em

  protection he drawled bringing forth
his pipe youre an observant young
woman but i trust fervently that youll
keep your observations to yourself i look
very much like another man and do not
care to be recognized for him-or mistaken
for him

  the girl laughed you dont look like
a criminal mr tompkins

  im not im really a mammalogist
now everybody here is positive that a
bug-hunter is crazy so im making it easy
all around by playing up to the part you
however dont look like a chicken-raiser

  but i am-at least thats what im go-
ing to be ive come from los angeles to
start a ranch here land is cheap theres
no fog the climate is ideal and for a while
i can sell all i can raise right here in
town

  dyou mean it asked tompkins in-
credulously

  of course i do the prospect looks a
whole lot better to me than the prospect of
your finding any animals or bugs out on the
desert

  you dont know a whole lot about the
desert do you he asked dryly

  no do you

  a little tompkins puffed at his pipe
rather hard for a moment frowning at the
sunset then he came to a halt and turned
to the girl with an air of decision

  see here miss gilman really i dont
want to intrude into your affairs but i
think that youre going ahead rather
blindly are you all alone here in town

  yes her eyes dwelt on his strong
rather harsh features with questioning
scrutiny but ive lived on ranches ive
taught school i have some money saved
up-and really mr tompkins im able to
look out for myself

  no youre not he said quietly sud-
denly a look came into his eyes that made
the girl catch her breath so furious and
deeply filled with passion was it youve
got to get out of here he exclaimed with
abrupt anger in his voice you dont
know what sort of a place this is-what
sort of men are centered around here
theres a gang of the vilest murderers
somewhere about stovepipe springs that
ever saw the light of day the whole place
is a decoy-trap for the unwary-for people
like you if that town knew what my
real name was what my errand is here my
life wouldnt be worth a plugged nickel

  startled by his vehemence sobered by
his words the girl met his gaze for a mo-
ment then frowned

  why do you speak this way she de-
manded calmly i think youre far off the
mark mr tompkins ive met everybody
in town since arriving yesterday theyre
good simple people-ignorant if you like
but at heart really fine im afraid youre
an un-american sort of person do you
regard everybody outside of new york
with the same savage intolerance do you
think that because nobody speaks french
in stovepipe springs evervbodv is a poor
hick

  tompkins stared at her for a minute

  good lord-my dear girl get me
right he exclaimed i mean literally
what i say i dont know what youre
talking about but i know what im talking
about 

  what then-bands of outlaws and rob-
bers she smiled ironically and the smile
stung tompkins

  something like that yes

  then i simply dont believe you she
said with quiet finality shall we go back
now

  as you prefer i hope you dont have
cactus and rattlers

any cause to remember my warning with
regret

hto this she made no response and they
returned in silence to the hotel tomp-
kins inwardly cursing his very undiplomatic
way of presenting the warning upon near-
ing the hostelry they encountered mose
pincus an earnest alert little man who
kept the general store and he immediately
cornered miss gilman with a request that
she send all orders for chicken equipment
through his agency tompkins went on
alone to his own place and when the lamp
was lighted he picked up his newspaper
and went definitely to work he knew
what to look for now

  it was a los angeles paper which he
had bought on leaving the railroad at
meteorite because it was the latest sheet to
be had now he searched the advertising
columns and after a moment chanced upon
the very thing he sought it was a large
display advertisement and after reading it
tompkins clipped it out and then perused
it more carefully and with keen apprecia-
tion it read as follows

chicken ranchers
come to chuckwalla county

  no california fogs in this state an ideal
  climate for chickens stovepipe springs will
  welcome you local demand for eggs is
  heavy not a chicken within a radius of
  thirty miles in one direction and  miles
  in all others

  off railroad but on state highway land
  from  to  per acre taxes so light they
  make you laugh correspondence invited
  the stovepipe springs chamber of com-
  merce will cooperate with you in every way
  write the secretary m j crowfoot first
  state bank stovepipe springs

  putting the clipping away in his pocket
tompkins got his pipe going and puffed for
a while in frowning reflection at length
he sighed

  well i suppose i cant help her any-
and i dont know that i blame her for feel-
ing as she does to all appearance this
is a harmless little desert town and nothing
else i dont even know that im right
havent a darned bit of proof to lay before
her but this sidewinder crowfoot sure
lays a clever trap for suckers not a
chicken around here eh hes dead right
at that what with coyotes skunks lynx
and snakes not to mention rats any
chickens would have a hard struggle and
the advertisement doesnt mention water
hm i wonder how many poor flies have

the blue



been drawn into this spider-net and sucked
dry and i wonder how many poor devils
have gone out into that desert around here
and never come back-like my brother
alec ramsay

  he puffed on a somber frown darkening
his keen eyes

chapter iii

vwhen percival henry j tompkins
 mammalogist walked into the first
state bank the next morning he wore his
best professorial air

  moses j crowfoot more generally
known as sidewinder was his own banking
force and sat alone at a desk behind a grill
which hedged off most of the bank he
was not afraid of robbers no professional
robber in the combined areas of nevada
utah and new mexico would have dreamed
of tackling the stovepipe springs bank be-
cause sidewinder crowfoot was an old-
timer who knew his business three
amateurs had undertaken the job two years
previously and each of them received a
forty-five slug squarely between the eyes

  the nickname was highly appropriate
like his namesake crowfoot was highly
venomous he struck without warning and
he struck to kill he was not a pleasant
man and he did not care to be pleasant
he lived alone in the old dim days side-
winder had been a monte dealer in the
alcora dance hall when the law clamped
down on gambling he had owned the oasis
saloon when the law clamped down on
liquor he had gone into banking some
people would claim this was natural evolu-
tion

  he looked up at his visitor without
speaking tompkins entirely ignoring what
had happened upon his arrival in town
came forward to the grill and smiled

  this i believe is mr crowfoot i
have been referred to you as owner of the
local garage i desire to rent an auto-
mobile with which to survey near-by areas
of the great american desert and pursue
my investigations of the fauna-

  cant be done said sidewinder curtly
we only got one rent car and thats en-
gaged the others a demonstrate and
we cant rent it or wed never sell it
ah thank you very much indeed
said tompkins and turned to the door
in that case i had better buy it

before sidewinder could call up any suit-
book magazine

able retort his visitor was gone to the
garage next door before sidewinder could
get there money had changed hands and
the shiny flivver reposing on the garage
floor was the property of the professor
finding himself too late to prevent the pur-
chase crowfoot put on his best air and
engaged tompkins in amiable talk while
the mechanic in charge filled the car with
oil and gas and put in half a dozen water-
bags

  hassayamp was telling me observed
the banker that you were askin about a
man named ramsay seems to me like i
recall the feller friend of yours

  a mere acquaintance said tompkins
i met him at palmdale on the other side
of the mohave while i was engaged in a
study of the curious flora over there poor
fellow i felt sorry for him he had lost
one eye and was afflicted with tuberculosis
and was at the age of sixty-five with not a
cent in the world he mentioned that he
thought of coming in this direction to
locate having been here some twenty
years ago during the mining boom

  oh said sidewinder with a relieved
air then it aint the same one the one
who went through here last year was a
right young feller red-haired and active if

i	was you perfesser id get loose of that
sagebrush he aint only a desert rat and
folks tell mighty queer stories about him
all desert rats are queer in the head you
know

  why-er-thats very good of you in-
deed said tompkins gratefully still i
have engaged the man perhaps heedlessly
and must keep my promises for a certain
time i suppose if i were to deposit my
money and valuables with you id be in
no danger

  right good plan said sidewinder
step into the bank and well arrange it

  tompkins obediently retraced his steps
and when he displayed his two certified
checks and his roll of loose bills the
banker became almost affable tompkins
meantime was quite conscious that he was
being closely studied and did not hesitate
to shove out all his chips and play the
game of innocence he agreed at once that
the best scheme was to deposit all his
money in care of mr crowfoot taking the
latters receipt for it and his air of eager
gratitude was pleasant to behold

 whom would you recommend as a
guide he inquired when the transaction
was completed after a trip with the

by h bedford-jones



person i have engaged i might find it ad-
visable to take another cicerone

  right good idea said mr crowfoot
hassayamps a good man- i tell you
theres a feller will be in town next week
ill speak to him about it harrison his
name is-mesquite harrison

  a slight pallor crossed the face of
tompkins but he responded gratefully
by all means kindly engage him for
me i shall expect to use him at once and
thank you again for your kindness in the
matter

  dont mention it said sidewinder
and grinned to himself when his caller had
departed there was no longer any doubt
that the professor was what hassayamp
proclaimed him-a natural-born fool like
all bug-hunters no one else would have
handed over his money so readily

tompkins walked back to the hotel
a and on the doorstep of his own cell
found sagebrush awaiting him inside
with the door closed the desert rat
chuckled

  i reckon hassayamp is right uppity
over losin the chance to guide ye per-
fesser he announced but you done jest
right hassayamp dont know nothin
about the desert

  no tompkins lighted his pipe he
lives here doesnt he

  sho hes like jose garcia let a vine-
garoon git on him and he throws a fit
no sir hassayamp jest plumb aint a
desert man he knows a sight o locations
him and sidewinder have sold a hell of a
lot too folks buy a place and set awhile
and next time i come in to town theyre
gone thars cabins all over betwixt yere
and the chuckwallas where the ground
has been sold and deserted hassayamp
hires fellers to prove up on homestead
rights then buys the homestead offm em
and sells it again he aint no guide though
all he knows is roads git him offm the
road or show him a trantler in his blan-
kets and gosh hassayamp is worsen a
tenderfoot say i heard a good one on
him this trip

  sagebrush chuckled again spat on the
floor and scratched his whiskers

  met up with two fellers in the salt
pans-ol hardrock miller from tucson
and another feller hardrock used to be a
mormon fore they run him out of arizona
for bein too durned mormonistic he tells
me hassayamp used to be one too away
cactus and rattlers

over to st johns bout fifteen year back
cordin to him hassayamp vanished real
sudden one night and so did all the money
helongin to the church and several head
of hosses belongin to other folks may not
be true though hardrock miller saved
hisself from bein lynched once by tellin
the truth and aint never done it since
afraid his luckd turn maybe

  tompkins smiled know a fellow by
the name of mesquite harrison

  do i sagebrush scowled and spat
again is that skunk in town then by
gosh im goin for him the desert rat
shot a hand to his waistband where there
was a swelling about the size of a revolver
why perfesser mesquite is rank pizen
yessir ive knowed him to rob prospec-
tors of their grub-its a fact and once
he changed the signs over in the salt pans
sos a poor pilgrim took his team the
wrong way and durned near died and that
skunk mesquite robbed him bare by gosh
anybody who changes water-hole signs in
the salt pans gits shot on sight mesquite
knows it too he dont come to town
when im due usually-

  hes not here now said tompkins
i heard the name mentioned thats all
ive bought a flivver and i wish youd
purchase all supplies necessary and get
them loaded into the back seat strap her
down good we can get off in the morn-
ing

  gosh said sagebrush a far-away look
in his eyes itll seem lonesome as hell
without them burros-well spose i got to
do it where we goin to

  dont know yet

  id sort o like to look over them ledges
jest this side the chuckwallas-over by
pinecate canon said the desert rat
thoughtfully

  can we find any crotalus cerastes
there

  i reckon so find most anything
there sagebrush inspected his employer
curiously say you aint so bad a feller
when you git off to yourself perfesser
you talk real human kind of put on dog
when theres any folks around dont you
tompkins laughed i expect i do sage-
brush how about water over by that
place you mentioned-pinecate canon
plenty right now rains aint only jest
quit another two weeks and we wont
find nary a drap canon ought to look
right pretty too with the flowers the
desert sure is handsome this time o year

the blue



all the bugs cornin out too sos youll
feel to home lots o tumble-bugs oyer by
the mesa and canon-thats how come its
called pinecate bein the mex name for
tumble-bug

  ever hear of a fellow named ramsay
who was interested in mines around here
nope sagebrush rose well i
reckon ill go git them supplies then git
my correspondence finished today see you
around sunup tomorrow

iie departed tompkins left alone
opened his two large grips and began
to pack one of them for the trip the
larger part of the contents consisted of sup-
plies such as could not be purchased in
stovepipe springs there was even a large
alcohol stove with plentiful fuel the pack-
ing finished from a secret pocket inside
the grip tompkins took a letter and began
to peruse it carefully not for the first nor
the tenth time the envelope had been
postmarked stovepipe springs and bore
a date of a year past it was the final
portion of the letter which attracted the
rereading of tompkins however

    enclosed is the deed to the property i
  am more than satisfied with the prospects of
  the location you will notice that the min-
  ing rights revert to the state in most in-
  stances but here i have bought the land
  outright so there is no question of mineral
  rights a man called mesquite harrison
  owned it

    i have seldom seen a more beautiful spot
  even after the desert rains fbr it is filled
  with all kinds of flowers what a pity that
  flowers and water cannot last halfway up
  the canon there is a huge boulder of pink
  granite split squarely in two with three
  pinons growing out of the split and a tiny
  spring trickling from the pinons really a
  marvel i understand the spring never fails
  though it is too tiny to be of much use
  well good-by for this time im going
  to spend two months at the location and
  if it has any gold ill know by that time

 your loving brother

		alec

  tompkins folded the letter and put it
away again then sat down and sucked at
his empty pipe

  poor alec-what happened to him i
wonder he muttered and not a thing
to go on deed to the property lost no
way of finding its location never recorded
the deed how was that deed lost the
letter was mailed here it must have been
in the letter therefore-but ive no proof
hell once let me get a grip on something
definite
book magazine

  he seized his glasses impatiently donned
them and left the room outside he al-
most ran into miss gilman she greeted
him brightly

  good morning sir i hope your diges-
tion is better today

  no its worse tompkins smiled
please remember to say nothing of my
remarks

  ill have no chance she returned
were leaving after breakfast tomorrow
mr foster-otherwise hassayamp-is tak-
ing me over toward those hills in the east
he knows of a splendid location for my
chicken-ranch pinecate mesa-isnt that
a romantic name

  very said tompkins gravely very
romantic it means tumblebug i may
be going in that direction myself so ill
hope to see you again

  and before she could say yea or nay to
this he went on his way

chapter iv

cunrise found haywire serving an
 early feed to tompkins and sagebrush
while the laden flivver rested out in front
of the hotel awaiting them tompkins ex-
pected to drive the flivver-in fact he was
forced to drive it when they had about
finished their breakfast hassayamp ap-
peared yawning

  you gents sure are industrious critters
he observed casually which way you
headin for

  west said tompkins promptly we
shall impersiflate the great and boundless
expanses of the arid lands beneath the set-
ting sun

  thats good hassayamp bent a signif-
icant eye on sagebrush its right healthy
out in the flat country i got to go east
my own self today well so long and
good luck to you puffesser hope you find
lots of bugs

  travelin with me said sagebrush
the perfesser wont find nothing else

  i believe it returned hassayamp
acidly i sure believe it

  meanin what demanded sagebrush
one hand slipping toward his waistband

  meanin that you sure know the desert
o course what else would i mean
sagebrush grunted and departed while
hassayamp muttered inaudibly and glared

  tompkins climbed into the flivver
sagebrush climbed in after him and with a

by h bedford-jones

roar the little car started out of town one
mile north of stovepipe springs the main
highway turned abruptly to the right for
the chuckwalla range and beyond it the
civilized purlieus of chuckwalla city
thirty miles away the desert highway
continued on ahead and ran a flea-bitten
track straight over the northern horizon

  i suppose asked tompkins as they
rattled out of town you never happened
to meet up with a large pink granite
boulder halfway up a canon split in two
with three pinons growing out of it and a
little spring at the foot of the pinons
nope said sagebrush after a moment
nope cant say that i have but that
dont signify much aint no pinon trees
around yere except toward the chuck-
wallas pink granite is most anywheres im
right disappointed you aint headin east
id kind o set my notions on looking over
that there pinecate section

  tompkins chuckled then as they ap-
proached the turn in the highway he
swung the car to the right and headed for
the distant peaks of the chuckwallas
thats where were going sagebrush
how come you told hassayamp-
because i was telling hassayamp
sagebrush grinned got out a black plug
of navy cut and bit happily at it

  you and me sure is goin to get on
perfesser whoop her up then he
grunted you heard what he said bout
it bein healthy out to the desert durn
him durn him and sidewinder and all
the rest o them galoots  they been tryin
to keep me out o the chuckwallas for
quite a spell back i bet hassayamps got
some claims over there hisself

  why have they been trying to keep you
out of there

  dad-blamed if i know jest plumb
ornery i reckon maybe theyre afraid
id meet some o the pilgrims they gets
located over there and talk they alius
locates some over there this time o year
when theres lots o water and things look
good

tompkins who had removed his yellow
blinders squinted out at the desert with
frowning eyes and drove on in silence he
was reasonably sure that in sagebrush
beam he had chanced upon the one man
who might be of incalculable value to him
however he was not disposed to take any
premature chances his own real business
here was a matter for himself alone


cactus and rattlers

  the flivver ate up the miles rapidly ever
advancing upon the chuckwalla hills which
appeared to recede as it approached to
one acquainted with the desert only from
the window of a railroad car this mornings
ride would have been a tremendous sur-
prise under close inspection what ap-
peared to be ground flat as a billiard table
was shown to be in reality dissected by al-
most invisible arroyos aijd crowned by
slight rises the blinding white desert
glare was in fact a spectrum of brilliancy
only visible to accustomed eyes the
eastern horizon was barred by the chuck-
wallas a rather high range which on their
western slopes presented only a bleakly
dun expanse streaked with purple to
west and north were scattered buttes in
splendid colorings of scarlet and lavender
and gold while the patches of cacti across
the desert floor made brilliant carpet-spots
of vivid green sprinkled with the raw yet
blending hues of an oriental rug here
were ocatilla sprays towering up many feet
in glowing blossom here were opuntias
gorgeous with red and yellow clusters
gaunt joshua trees gay with bloom-all the
brief flower-time of the desert was at its
height in a few more days the blossoms
would be gone the myriad flowers spring-
ing from the earth would be withered and
the white glare would break only over the
brownish-green verdure of brush and cactus
in summer garb

  hot as that glare might be the motion
of the car kept its occupants comfortable
and the flivver itself specially equipped
vith water-pump for desert use made no
complaint as the miles dropped behind
now and again tompkins asked a ques-
tion sagebrush responding curtly gar-
rulous as he was at times the old desert
rat was for the most part silent as the
desert itself whose quiet was broken only
by the angry chattering of cactus wrens or
the occasional shrill call-whistle of a
thrasher

  twenty miles had been covered and the
chuckwalla slopes apparently as distant
as ever were now broken up into foothills
and deep canons all a dead dun glare
under the white sun when sagebrush
touched the arm of the driver

  half a mile ahead the trail branches off
to pinecate mesa thats it off to the left
-reglar saddletop look out for a dry
wash soons-ye leave the road

  tompkins looked at pinecate this was
a great gaunt saddleback that ran off into

the blue

the range he set it down as about ten
miles distant and well to the left the
canon which gave access to the mesa itself
was as sagebrush informed him on the
north side and therefore out of sight at
present

  the turnout was almost invisible but
tompkins caught it swerved the car into
the looser sand and was aware of a grunt
of assent from beside him then he
jammed on the brakes and slid into a dry
wash which at the moment was a foot deep
in water splashed through and climbed
out on the other side

  hold on a minute spoke up sage-
brush lets have a look at this yere
trail

  the car halted and both men got out
here off the highway and sheltered by the
mesquite on either hand the loose earth
would bear any sign indefinitely for
nothing less than a sandstorm would wash
over the tracks sagebrush examined the
sand attentively then expectorated and
turned to tompkins who had donned his
yellow blinders as a protection against the
glare

  what dye make of it

  automobile said tompkins how
long ago i cant say

cagebrush grunted at this and
 pointed to a series of scroll-like mark-
ings which followed the right-hand tire-rut
then he indicated further prints in the
shape of a maltese cross which had ob-
viously been made over the scrolls

  flivver come along yere yestiddy he
stated last night a sidewinder come
along and follered the ruts then this
mornin early a roadrunner come along
likewise

  all obvious but the time sherlock
said tompkins gravely how do you
know it was yesterday and not last week

  cause i seen that thar cuss hassayamp
ridin out this-a-way yestiddy momin as

i	was cornin in to town to mail my post-
cards some skullduggery goin on

  hm tompkins frowned sagebrush
that mesa up ahead would make a fine
place for a chicken-ranch wouldnt it

  hell of a fine place affirmed the
desert rat squinting at the long saddle-
back danged fine place perfesser
every wildcat and coyote in the chick-
wallas would be pointin that way inside
of a week if a gent was feelin real
philanthropic and wantin to help out the


book magazine

pore desert critters id say start him a
chicken-and-egg factory right up yonder
yessir thats like haywire johnson
done time he was livin down to meteorite
he started him a egg-ranch-done it to get
ahead of some other folks and kep it real
quiet got all his chickens clear from
phoenix and yuma danged near a hull car-
load of em and set up incubators and all
that truck then he begun to figger on
how rich hed be every oncet in a while
hed go out to look for eggs but dad blame
if he got any he fed them chickens on
everything from ground-up lizards to egg-
plant and nary a egg come along finally
he got desprit and called in help-and
dumed if all them birds wasnt roosters
yessir not a female chicken in the lot
thats how come haywire went broke and
had to come over yere to work for hassa-
yamp

tompkins grinned despite himself

  then he sobered

  look here sagebrush remember that
young woman at the hotel theyve framed
up a deal on her theyre trying to sell her
a chicken-ranch on this mesa

  sounds like them city fellers dad
blame theyd rob a dyin man serves the
female right too for havin that much
money females aint got no right to have
money oncet when i was married and
livin down to umatilla my ol woman got
ten dollars from one of her relations and
went to phoenix and durned if she didnt
spend it all in three days when i trounced
her for it she up and run off with a mor-
mon from yuma and thats the last of
her twenty years ago that was and i
been happy ever since and aint looked
twice at no females

  thats a novel argument certainly
said tompkins but im going to try and
keep miss gilman from getting robbed
are you with me

  sagebrush rubbed his whiskers squinted
at the sand expectorated over an unwary
chuckwalla lizard and then responded
without enthusiasm

  nope quicker that there female gits
skun and gits out o this country better
off ill be i dont hanker after no females
spoilin the scenery besides which i aint
pinin to start no argument with side-
winder crowfoot and his crowd not with-
out they force me into it leave the other
feller alone i says so longs he dont crowd
ye none

by h bedford-jones



  all right then said tompkins briskly
and turned to the car lets get moving

they drove on in renewed silence

  tompkins had a new angle on his com-
panion and was not sure that he liked it
at all events he perceived that sagebrush
knew his own mind and was not to be
depended upon as an assistant under the
present completion of things the desert
rat had a certain peculiar philosophy of his
own like all old prospectors and argu-
ments against it would be as useless as the
teeth of a coyote against the shell of a
tortoise so tompkins held his peace

  the flat desert gave way to hills and
depressions as they drew closer to the
range and by the action of the engine
tompkins knew that they had been on a
steady climb also he began to sight
scattered pinon trees indicating a higher
altitude and was conscious that they were
following an ancient road presently the
car was climbing along a well defined valley
which sagebrush called mint canon

   stamp-mill ahead of us he an-
nounced fellers used to bring quartz
down to it from all around in the ol days
got to leave the car there job carter put
up that there mill four-stamp crusher she
was-dad blame how job did like his
licker used to make mint juleps in a
bucket thats how come he growed mint
job he used to whiff the mint and then
throw down the licker while he held his
breath one night he wakes up with a
pain in his stummick and mixes him a
julep in the dark and got him the cyanide
bottle by mistake and hes buried some-
where back o the mill right now thats
what comes o not stoppin to appreciate
your licker as it goes down

  they rounded a low hill and halted by
the remains of the stamp-mill-a structure
of weather-beaten boards open in front
with the remains of a shed adjoining the
machinery was rusted and strewn about
the place haphazard and the whole place
was the epitome of desolation to one side
was a board floor-the only relic of what
had once been a roadside saloon adjoin-
ing the mill

  sagebrush pointed out that by leaving
the car here in shelter of the shed they
could then shoulder packs and cover the
last three miles to pinecate canon on foot
the professor took one look at the duffle
in the rear of the car and threw in the
gears
cactus and rattlers

  not by a blamed sight he said cheer-
fully looks like hassayamps car has
gone ahead so well do likewise did i
mention that hassayamp is bringing miss
gilman out today to look over the canon
for a chicken-ranch site

  dad blame it groaned sagebrush
then im goin to take my pick and go
look over the north end o the mesa you
can pester around that female if ye like
perfesser but not me send up a smoke
when theyre gone and ill come in
agreed and tompkins laughed as he
sent the car ahead in the faint tracks left
by the other flivver

chapter v

xioon was past and over tompkins

	 ensconced in a niche of the canon was
delightedly observing the scene before him
sagebrush was gone the flivver was laid
up out of sight a half-mile away in a
thicket of cactus and pinon

  it was peaceful here in the canon and
hot tompkins lay shaded by an over-
hanging rock which concealed him and en-
joyed himself while he waited he was a
third of the way up the canon which
wound upward for another mile before
opening on the mesa here it was fairly
wide and the sun had excellent chances
to radiate from the holders and the spring
life of the place was warmed into activity
patches of cacti and jack-pine abounded
no water was in sight but tompkins had
a water-bag within reach

  he lay perfectly quiet watching a trade-
rat whose nest lay in a cranny of the rocks
just to one side and a young coyote which
was vainly endeavoring to investigate the
rat and nest it was obvious that this
particular rat had migrated from the desert
below for while his nest was composed of
pebbles and sticks and all manner of queer
objects it was protected after the peculiar
fashion of his desert brethren two run-
ways entered the nest itself nearly out of
sight under the rocks and about these
runways laid with mathematical precision
were hundreds of terrible opuntia joints

  to tompkins as to every other natural-
ist it was an unsolved mystery how the
pack-rat with delicate and unprotected
paws could handle these joints of cactus
no other living creature can face the cholla
cactus whose spines as the indians de-
clare jump at one inflicting acute agony

the blue



even the rattler avoids it gingerly here
for a space of ten feet around the nest
were heaped the matted cholla joints while
the pack-rat who owned the establishment
sat out in full sight and insulted the hover-
ing coyote with angry taunts

  that the coyote was young and hungry
was obvious or he would not have at-
tempted to molest so well-entrenched a rat
oblivious to the presence of tompkins
who sat perfectly motionless he charged
again and again on those defenses each
time his courage failed at the last moment
and he would draw off snarling and snap-
ping in futile rage before his nose touched
the cholla

  in a cool niche between two rocks in
sight of tompkins above but concealed
from the furious coyote lay a fifteen-inch
sidewinder safely sheltered from the deadly
rays of the sun his brown-and-gray length
practically invisible against the rocks he
lay stretched out head lifted ready to
strike a venomous and malignant thing be-
yond all words with his horned features
and green jewels of eyes the coyote un-
conscious of this lurking death continued
backward and forward now rushing and
now sending a flurry of sand flying in his
anger one such flurry had aroused the
sidewinder and tompkins waited for the
inevitable since the coyote was drawing
closer and closer to the unseen death

  now it came with such rapidity that the
eye could scarcely follow pawing the
sand the coyote came sidewise toward the
niche of the sidewinder then went forward
in another rush stopped short snarled and
took courage again his leap brought him
past the niche and the sidewinder after
the fashion of his kind struck without
warning or coiling there is nothing swifter
than the strike of a sidewinder-but the
coyote saw the lurking death just in time
a frantic yap of fear broke from his jaws
he gave a desperate twist sidewise in mid-
leap-a doubling-up of his body that
evaded the reptiles blow-and in mad
panic came down and leaped again blindly
he landed squarely in the matted cholla

  agonized howls rent the air and sticks
and bones and odd objects from the pack-
rats nest were hurled about the coyote
became a whirlwind of furry agony from
which proceeded howl upon howl of an-
guish then tail between legs waling to
high heaven with every leap the wretched
coyote went down the canon like a streak
and was gone
book magazine



by h bedford-jones

tompkins caught up the stone under

	his hand and hurled it then rose
crushed the sidewinder lay quivering a
glittering object had caught the eye of
tompkins and now he raked it forth from
the cholla with a long stick it was one of
the mass of objects which had formed the
rats nest flung about by the agonized
flurry of the coyote when he had it
within reach tompkins picked it up and
stood staring at it incredulity and horror
mingling in his eyes it was a small tar-
nished cigarette case of silver and upon it
he made out the initials a r

  the case i gave alec for christmas two
years ago

  the words died on his lips it was the
property of his vanished brother alec ram-
say holding the case in his hand he
stared over the desolate empty canon until
the heat of the sun roused him he
stooped donned his pith helmet and then
looked again at the metal case mechani-
cally he pressed the spring which refused
to work taking out his knife tompkins
pried the case open-and beneath the
spring-holder discovered a folded paper on
which was scrawled in pencil the writing
of his brother

  his blurred eyes cleared at the top
was written

    send this to pat ramsay glendale apts
  denver

  and below scrawled more sharply but
ending with an uncertain dash

    dear pat forgot to mail this too late
  they got me shot through lungs  men
  in party bad gang here all located
  hourglass canon n e of here box
  canon cholos and whites sidewinder-

  that was all lips compressed tomp-
kins read and reread this fateful message
which now he knew to be a message from
the dead then in that cold certainty he
opened the folded paper and found it to
be a deed made out by mesquite harrison
to alec ramsay

  by glory-the deed to alecs mining
property he ejaculated as he conned the
writing therein then when he had finished
reading he folded up the deed replaced it
in the cigarette case slipped the case into
his pocket and stood staring up the wind-
ing reaches of the green canon

  that property was located in this very
canon stunned as he was by surprise
heaped on surprise he realized this only too

clearly his brother was dead the
property in question had been bought from
sidewinder crowfoot for whom mesquite
harrison had acted as a blind it lay
somewhere up there toward the mesa-
marked by that split pink granite boulder
perfectly described in the deed as to
bounds and extent it was this identical
canon for which he had come searching so
blindly had he gone on around the next
bend he would have found the boulder
with its pinon trees

  tompkins sank down and took his head
between his hands striving hard for sanity
his first impulses were not sane at all
they were murderous his brain was seeth-
ing in tumult he was not red-headed for
nothing

  by slow degrees his thoughts settled down
into grim coherence now he knew what
he had long ago presumed to be the case-
that his brother was dead but here in his
pocket was evidence as to who was re-
sponsible there was no direct evidence
against sidewinder crowfoot but tomp-
kins brushed this impatiently aside he was
perfectly convinced that crowfoot was the
man behind everything going on here

  at the same time ive got to be sane-
got to be he thought desperately fight-
ing for self-control i cant go off half-
cocked theyve got brains theyll get
me if i let out a peep nothing but my
own brains will save me now and if i
dont go slow im a goner sure this
changes my whole program now i know
everything-and its up to me to get busy
first thing to do is to get back to town
and get this deed recorded-send it in by
registered mail the stage goes out in the
morning so any time wttt do for that
chuckwalla city is the county seat might
run over there in the flivver only id
better see sidewinder crowfoot get my
money and sever connections and ill
want a rifle before i go up against that
crowd in hourglass canon wherever it is
then-

iie was abruptly startled from his reflec-
tions by an eager hail and looked tip
to see miss gilman approaching with
hassayamp trailing behind her he had
forgotten the girl and now an exclamation
of dismay broke from him then he rose
donning glasses and helmet again and nerv-
ously lighted up his pipe

  we didnt see you till we were almost
on top of you exclaimed miss gilman
cactus and rattlers

were you asleep what makes your face
look so white

  a touch o sun madam no i was
not asleep i was watching the peregrina-
tions of yonder pack-rat not so fast mr
foster-there is a large crotalus cerastes
just by your left foot

  a which demanded hassayamp by
no means pleased to see the professor

  i believe you would term the reptile
a sidewinder-

  oh my gosh hassayamp saw the
dead snake and did an acrobatic stunt that
removed him some distance away while a
revolver came out in his hand

  dont shoot said tompkins hes
dead i killed him

  why in hell didnt you say so first
snapped hassayamp angrily what you
doin up this-a-way thought you was
headin into the sink-holes

  i changed my mind said tompkins
he showed miss gilman the pack-rats
nest thats worth seeing i have a
particular reason for asking you to remem-
ber it but may i inquire whither you two
are heading

  up the canon to look at a chicken-
ranch site said the girl glancing from him
to the nest and back again will you
come along or dont you feel well
really you looked almost ghastly at first
mr tompkins

  reckon the climb would be too blamed
hard on the puffesser maam struck in
hassayamp who did not desire company
and there aint no bugs up there

  all the more honor in discovering some
sir i accept your invitation madam and
shall accompany you a little way

  weve brought lunch along if youll
join us invited miss gilman starting off
again with tompkins at her side he
glanced around and saw that hassayamp
had paused to wipe a dripping brow and
bite off a fresh chew and was momentarily
out of earshot swiftly he took the
cigarette-case from his pocket and passed
it to the girl

  open this and read it-quick now i
found it in that rats nest when i tell
you my real name is pat ramsay youll
be able to guess why i came here-and
whether my warning was well founded
read the deed carefully then see whether
the place youre going to buy corresponds
with it quickly ill hold this rascal
engaged read and give it back to me i
must get back to town at once

the blue

vvith this rapid utterance he turned
 abruptly from the girl and walked
back to hassayamp halting the latters ad-
vance with upraised hand

  mr foster he said solemnly may
i inquire sir-ah that is a very interesting
creature on your collar very interesting
indeed 

  hassayamp screwed his head to look at
himself but could see nothing

  what is it he demanded nervously
a beautiful little creature peculiar to
our deserts said tompkins in bland ac-
cents undoubtedly it has sought refuge
from the sun under your shirt-collar you
know of course that the solpugid is really
an insect having tracheal tubes instead of
the spiders book lungs-

  a spider exclaimed hassayamp git
it offm me puffesser quick

  not a spider at all my dear sir and
quite harmless i assure you despite local
superstition ah there it goes about your
collar-no wonder the dear little creatures
are called wind-scorpions or vinegaroons-
a matavenado-wow my gosh git
him offm me hassayamp let out a yell
and began to claw at himself im a dead
man-git him offm me-

  tompkins seized him and brushed
vigorously at his back

  there-hes gone pay no more at-
tention to the matter i implore you i
was about to ask whether you ever in-
dulge in spiritous liquors mr foster in
such case i have in my pocket a small
vial of medicinal whisky i understand
that it is the custom in the desert to offer
a drink-

  hassayamp who like many another man
with slight experience of the harmless but
frightful-looking vinegaroons believed them
to be deadly creatures was pale with
emotion and with more than emotion
too

  if you got a drink puffesser he im-
plored for gosh sake give it here i
swallered my plug

  tompkins produced a small pocket-flask
and began to unscrew it hassayamp be-
came yet more pale and agitated

  oh gosh he groaned ill never eat
no more tobacker-

  he reached out and took the flask he
sniffed it and into his melancholic eyes
came a glow of warmth and happiness
tompkins beamed upon him as he lifted
the flask

  i forgot to mention mr foster that


book magazine



you must use your mustache as a strainer
because in that whisky i am preserving a
very fine specimen of rock scorpion which
i recently discovered and i should be very
sorry to have it lost-

  hassayamp jerked the flask from his
lips he looked at the professor with
slowly distending eyes then thrust the
flask at him and with one agonized groan
retired among the near-by boulders

  tompkins turned and rejoined miss gil-
man

  hassayamp will rejoin you shortly he
said he unfortunately swallowed his
chew of tobacco-an accident which will
unnerve the strongest man i assure you-
the girl looked at him with strained and
anxious eyes

  but this-this paper do you mean to
tell me that this man alec ramsay was
your brother

  tompkins nodded quietly yes miss
gilman i came here to trace him-and
by a stroke of sheer luck i found this
cigarette-case you have read that deed
then i advise you to go on up the canon
and see if the description fits i havent
been up there be very careful to say noth-
ing to hassayamp about this ill see you
tonight if- may and well talk over what
is to be done now i must get off-youd
better keep a sharp lookout for rattlers
among these rocks dont wait for hassa-
yamp hell be along as soon as hes able
hast a la vista

  she made no response but stood gazing
after him thoughtfully as he turned and
dfparted

chapter vi

as tompkins climbed down the rock- 
 strewn canon toward the thorny growth
which hid the flivver from sight he came
to a decision upon his course of action
forcing himself to determine upon a cau-
tion which was distasteful and yet neces-
sary

  hasta manana he resolved until
tomorrow at least i must remain percival
and so forth tompkins-and then ill be-
come pat ramsay once more and get into
action the damned murderers i won-
der how many men have gone the way of
poor alec i wonder how many people
have been decoyed into this spiderweb to
lose everything they had alec must have
gone investigating must have discovered

by h bedford-jones

the headquarters of this gang-and so
they finished him hes probably lying
somewhere up that canon now well time
enough to look him up just now ive got
to watch my step mighty close

  he was now assailed by the problem
of locating sagebrush since he could not
well run off with the car and leave his com-
panion to rusticate in the desert solitudes
as he came in sight of the patch of pinon
and cactus which enshrined the flivver he
caught no sign of the desert rat he knew
that he could recall sagebrush with a
smoke but this he did not desire to do un-
less necessary

  when he drew near the clump he per-
ceived hassayamps flivver on the other
side with strips of canvas flung over the
tires to protect them an unusual object
beneath this car attracted his attention and
upon closer approach he discovered it to
be no other than sagebrush he gave a
hail and the old desert rat crawled out into
the sunlight

  an exclamation broke from tompkins
and he hurried forward the left arm of
sagebrush was out of its shirt-sleeve and
roughly bandaged and the bandage was
dark with blood

 what happened he demanded
howd you hurt yourself old-timer
sagebrush clawed at his whiskers and
flung the inquires a pained look

  you got it plumb wrong perfesser he
observed i aint been meanderin around
these parts for fifteen year or more thout
leamin how not to hurt myself i aint no
pilgrim by gosh

  my humble apologies said tompkins
dryly may i ask then who hurt you

 sagebrush grinned

  another of these yere smart gents who
think that cause a mans a prospector and
dont wear galluses hes a babe in arms
i aint right certain as to this fellers name
but when i was over to mohave six months
ago i seen a picture of him in the sheriffs
office name was joe mendoza or some
such cholo name

  the speaker enjoyed hugely the bewil-
derment of tompkins

  you dont mean you had a scrap sage-
brush

  nope sagebrush expectorated wiped
his lips and grinned i was peckin away
at a ledge in a canon a couple mile east
of yere when durned if that feller mesquite
harrison didnt come ridin down the
canon on a hoss yessir right on top
cactus and rattlers



o me fore i seen him too he started
throwin lead and i covered up and fore
i could git into action the coyote was
gone then along come another feller that
i hadnt seen this yere cliolo and dumed
if he didnt pick on me too but i was
ready for him you betcha i gives him
jest one crack from op betsy-here
sagebrush patted his waistband signifi-
cantly-and he flops i walks over to
him and seen he looked like this cholo men-
doza and then i come back yere and set
down to rest a spell

  killed him asked tompkins curtly

  hope so he was some dead when i
left him anyhow but you never can tell
bout them marihuana-eaters i knowed a
cholo over to mormon wells oncet that et
marihuana and smoked it likewise finly
one night he got plumb filled up on it and
jumped into the corral and begun to slash
the hosses with his knife sheriff and two
other fellers sat on the bars and pumped
lead into him for as much as five minutes
but he didnt quit till hed slashed every
hoss there then he quit sheriff allowed
hed been dead with the first shot but the
marihuana had kep him goin sames a
rattler keeps a-twitchin till sundown after
hes dead that there hop is powerful
stuff perfesser

tompkins stood staring at the desert

	rat for a moment then

  the whole gang will be after you now
wont they

  sagebrush gave him a queer look how
come you know so durned much perfes-
ser

  thats what im here to know snapped
tompkins suddenly remember my ask-
ing you about a boulder with pinon trees
growing out of it well that place is up
yonder in pinecate canon my name isnt
tompkins at all its pat ramsay last
year my brother alec came over here to
spend a year in the desert and clear up
his lungs he bought a place and vanished
-clear vanished and couldnt be traced
the last heard of him was from stovepipe
springs he wrote me about a place he
had bought describing that boulder i
found this up the canon in a pack-rats
nest look it over while i get the car
ready

  he gave the cigarette-case to the staring
desert rat then turned and went back
to his own car when he got this out of
the brush he removed most of the load

the blue

and hid it securely among the trees this
done he returned to sagebrush who was
sitting on the running-board of hassa-
yamps car examining the deed

  anything i can do for your arm he
asked

  nope bone aint hurt say perfesser
youve sure struck me all of a heap still
i knowed you wasnt the danged fool you
looked

  thanks tompkins laughed curtly
now sagebrush im going to town speak
easy to everyone and slide back here
first i want to investigate that hourglass
canon wherever it is-

  i know where it is said sagebrush
scratching his wealth of whiskers

  all right where do you come in on
the program want to be left out
sagebrush produced his pipe and sucked
at it at length he made slow answer

  perfesser theres some folks around here
jest pining to be left alone and most gen-
ally they gets left alone that cholo men-
doza was one such and killin him aint
botherin me none most likely youve dis-
counted sidewinder crowfoot

  my guess is that hes the head of the
whole gang

  reckon ye aint far off now so long
as i aint bothered i aint troublin nobody
my motter is never to bother a rattler
whats a gent and sounds his rattles-but
if he acts like a sidewinder then bash his
head and do it pronto yestiddy you asks
if ill help keep this yere female from get-
tin skun and i says no i still aint in-
trested nohow but two of that danged
crowd have set in on me with a cold deck
this mornin and im plumb riled yessir
im riled

  sagebrush stood up his bent figure
straightened a trifle and a sudden savage
expression showed in his eyes half masked
behind the hairy growth of whiskers in
a flash all his dirt and squalor all his un-
kempt and sun-bleached appearance was
gone in the eyes of tompkins he saw there
a desert man who cared nothing for ex-
ternals but who could cope daily with the
bitterest and most fearful forces of nature
-and who was now ready to turn his in-
ward strength against men the drab and
plodding desert rat suddenly showed for
one flashing moment what unsuspected
depths of character lay within him and a
rush of anger unbarred the floodgates of
his reticence

  yessir im riled ive seen them go-
book magazine	by h bedford-jones



ins-on and said nothin ive seen them
outlaws rulin the roost around yere and
said nothin twant no skin offm my
nose i hadnt no call to butt in ive
seen folks come in yere right happy and
seen em go out skim and misable and
busted ive seen one feller after another
come in yere with the law two jumps be-
hind him and he goes over to hourglass
canon and lives happy no law reaches
in yere nobody dast to interfere and no-
body knows about it anyhow stovepipe
springs dad blame it is jest a blind if
any law-offcer comes pirootin around he
gits steered plumb careful and goes away
thout learnin nothin but now by gosh
im riled yessir perfesser im with ye
six ways from sunday them skunks have
sold us chips in this yere game and by
gosh ill play them chips till hell freezes
over name your ante perfesser and
lets go

cagebrush relaxed he stuck his pipe
 in his pocket brought out his plug and
bit off a large section tompkins taking
the cigarette case and pocketing it nodded

  good im going to get a rifle in town
and come back tomorrow morning without
anyone suspecting what i have in mind
then ill be pat ramsay once more want
to go to town with me

  reckon not said sagebrush reflec-
tively mesquite was headin for town
and him and me would sure collide that
might spoil your hand and say i re-
member that brother o yours i seen him
with mesquite one time he looked a heap
like you do thout them specs and all

  tompkins produced his pocket flask
opened it and held it out

  heres to our luck sagebrush good
hunting 

  with a grunt of delight sagebrush lifted
the flask and absorbed his share of the
contents tompkins finished it off undis-
turbed by any thought of rock scorpions
eyed the empty glass container and with a
laugh tossed it into the clump of trees

  then im off ill be back in the morn-
ing have to send that deed to be re-
corded anything you want from town

  sagebrush wiped his lips and nodded

  yep theres jest one feller there ye
can trust-haywire johnson up to the
hotel register that deed and send it by
him and tell him to shet up about it
otherwise that durned hassayamp will
poke his nose into it then tell haywire

to give you that there gun hes keepin for
me i dont aim to carry moren one gun
these days not havin much use for it and
haywire has been keepin my other one
ill mosey up this yere canon and have
breakfast ready for ye in the mornin git
out early

  with another nod tompkins climbed
into his car started the engine and started
away he knew well enough that sage-
brush would carefully avoid meeting has-
sayamp and miss gilman

  what most stirred in his mind however
as he headed for town was that mention
of his brother and mesquite harrison--and
mesquite was now in town taken in con-
junction with crowfoots recommendation
here was a chance not to be missed

  ill sure interview mr harrison and
give him the time of his life before im
done with him thought tompkins and
he glanced at the sun hm i can get
to town and clean up everything before
supper then ill want to see miss gil-
man she must be persuaded to get out
of here at once hm queer how old
sagebrush showed up to all appearance
hes a comic-supplement character put him
on a city street and hed gather a crowd-
but how many of that crowd would last a
week with him on the mohave these
smart alecs back east who think europe
is better than america and who part their
hair the way the prince of wales does it
and who look on everyone west of newark
n j with supreme contempt-wouldnt i
like to see em get out in the desert with
old sagebrush though theyd find out
what sort of man it was who made this
country what she is

  it did not occur to him that in under-
taking to play a lone hand against the
hourglass canon gang he was likewise
carrying out certain traditions of amer-
icanism

chapter vii

the first state bank of stovepipe
springs had no banking hours but was
open whenever sidewinder crowfoot was
there it was nearly supper-time when
percival henry j tompkins entered and
sidewinder gazed at him in astonishment
thought you were off bug-hunting
tompkins shook his head sadly

  i regret to say sir that the man whom
i had engaged proved to be an unworthy
cactus and rattler



fthe blue

rascal i refer to mr beam in common
parlance he was drunk insisted on taking
me in the contrary direction to that which
i desired and even threatened me with a
revolver i abandoned him in the desert
but had i not encountered miss gilman
and mr foster i might never have found
my way back to town here is your re-
ceipt sir and i shall have to withdraw my
money temporarily until i can recompense
mr foster for his assistance and make
certain purchases tomorrow i hope to
start off again with a new guide

  the glittering gray eyes of sidewinder
were masked for a moment then shot up

  thats right good news he exclaimed
that feller i recommended to you mes-
quite harrison is here in town right now
want to see him

  by all means said tompkins grate-
fully if he can come to the hotel later
on this evening i shall be very glad-or
let us say early tomorrow morning i shall
be up with the sun and i trust early ris-
ing will not discommode him

  none to mention said sidewinder and
took an envelope from his safe heres
your money bring back what you got left
tomorrow and well take care of it
thank you-thank you very much
said tompkins and departed

  halting at the garage to see that fresh
supplies of fuel were put aboard the fliv-
ver which he left standing in the street he
walked on down to the hotel and found
haywire johnson in the office alone mr
tompkins produced a ten-dollar gold-piece
and laid it under the eyes of the startled
haywire

  want to earn that partner he asked
in his natural voice

  gosh yes said haywire promptly
whose mail dye wtant

  nobodys give me an envelope and
some sealing-wax when he was sup-
plied tompkins wrote a short note in-
closed with it the deed to alec ramsays
property in pinecate canon addressed the
envelope to the recorder in chuckwalla
city and sealed it up then he gave it
to haywire

  register this and slip it into tomorrow
mornings mail-sack without giving hassa-
yamp a squint at it that earns the first
ten tompkins now produced a second
gold-piece at which haywire goggled fran-
tically heres another you can earn go
over to pincus store and buy me a rifle
yrith a box of cartridges-

  hold on puffesser broke in haywire
quickly i got one ill sell cheap good
gosh yes five year old but bettern they
make em now distance sights

  all right sneak it into my room with
a box of cartridges to fit and ill pay you
for it bring along that gun youre keep-
ing for sagebrush beam too he wants it
theres the other ten youll earn it by
keeping your mouth shut real tight and
listen will you or hassayamp be on deck
along about sunup in the morning
hassayamp wont thats certain said
haywire staring at tompkins im liable
to be if ye want me

  all right you know mesquite harri-
son hes coming to see me bring him
right to my room savvy then if you
hear him yell be deaf in both ears and
if you see anything funny going on be blind
in both eyes

  all right puffesser gosh ye doht talk
like the same feller ye was-

  never mind your job is to be a human
sphinx supper ready

  bells just about to ring puffesser ill
be along drectly

ceeking his own cell tompkins en-
 joyed a thorough wash-up and before
he finished heard signs of life in the
adjoining room which tokened that miss
gilman had returned on his way to the
dining-room he encountered hassayamp
looking more melancholy than ever and
was given a cheerless nod then a flicker of
interest seized the hotel-proprietor

  say puffesser thought you aimed to
stay awhile in the desert

  so i did mr foster said tompkins
blandly so i did but i regret to say
that i had trouble with my companion
perhaps you observed that i was alone
when we met each other this afternoon
luckily i was able to follow the tracks of
your car back to town or i might have
been lost i trust your stomach trouble
has quite passed over

  more or less said hassayamp and
went his way

  tompkins went in and dined heartily
now confident that even if hassayamp and
sidewinder got together in conference dur-
ing the evening they would be unable to
figure him out to any great extent

  when miss gilman appeared at her
table she gave tompkins a smiling nod
and he perceived that her day on the burn-
ing sands had done its work well
book magazine



by h bedford-jones

  cold cream is recommended he ex-
claimed may i inquire whether you will
view the beauties of the sunset this eve-
ning in my company madam

  i shall be charmed-perfesser she
responded and tompkins grinned

  there was no sunset to view that eve-
ning however when they met in front of
the hotel a keen wind was coming down
off the chuckwalla hills and clouds had
appeared like magic in the sky they
walked together in silence toward the de-
serted buildings of the old boom town
until tompkins spoke

  well have snow upon the deserts
dusty face in the morning old omar
khayyam sure had been there ive seen
an inch of snow on the mohave at sun-
rise and itd be gone in an hour this is
probably the tail-ender of the season-
rains are all over now well how did you
find everything up the canon

  it was just as described in that deed
she said soberly oh im sorry for the
way i spoke the other night i didnt
think it could be possible mr-shall i
call you tompkins or ramsay

  neither one he responded with a
whimsical smile call me pat

  no i think you dont need any en-
couragement to impertinence and she
laughed but really-that canon was a
dream of beauty there was water run-
ning and in pools and all sorts of lilies were
there and flowers-

  sure a regular desert canon after the
rains said tompkins and not very far
away a dead man

  oh i didnt mean that i didnt want
to think of your brother as-

  im not talking about him another
man

che gave him a startled look you mean
 a man was killed out there

  yes and another wounded several are
going to be killed in the near future if
im any judge you neednt look alarmed
about it miss gilman theyre outlaws
ive opened up the whole situation pretty
well i think now i hope youll take my
advice and get out of this town tomorrow
morning on the stage i expected to be
gone about sunrise as i have work waiting
for me out yonder but if you think youll
need any moral backing in drawing out of
the game ill stay and see you through
no thanks she returned quietly im
staying

  after what ive told you and showed
you he said with a frown

  yes now let me explain and dont
get too bossy hassayamp wanted to sell
me that claim belonging to your brother
its one of the most beautiful spots i ever
saw however i made some excuse about
it not being suited to chickens and im
going to buy the five acres adjoining it
and just above you wait till you see that
place its got-

  my dear girl said tompkins dont
you know chickens cant be raised here
without large and expensive precautions
oh im not quite a tenderfoot chick-
ens or not im going to own that piece
of land and ive taken warning from
you too because ill not turn over the
money until the title is clear and the deed
recorded the five acres cost me three
hundred dollars mineral rights and all
hassayamp owns it he showed me where
a mine used to be-its played out now
i dont care a bit if the place is never any
real good to me im going to keep it just
to live on when i get old and enjoy it
why you get a wonderful view from the
upper canon out over the desert 

  well said tompkins reluctantly
since your eyes are open i cant of course
make any more objections though you can
buy plenty of desert canon for less money
but what about transport

  ive bought hassayamps car its an
old one but i know all about a flivver
and it will do me then im going to get
a big tent set up there-

  tompkins groaned inwardly but pres-
ently changed the subject it was no use
whatever to raise up practical objections
the girl would have to find things out for
herself she was obviously determined on
her course and the more he saw of her the
more he began to feel that she was a pretty
competent young woman in fact as they
walked and spoke of cabbages and kings
he was distinctly and unpleasantly sur-
prised to find that it had grown dark and
very cold and that they must return to
shelter immediately when they had
reached the adobe cells that constituted the
hotel he paused at her door and shook
hands

  from now on miss gilman my names
ramsay-only youll come to calling me
pat especially if were to be neighbors if
you have any need of me dont hesitate to
summon me i believe haywire johnson
is a good sort and you may confide in him
cactus and rattlers

any time and by the way if you hear
any queer noises early in the morning dont
call for help

  i usually dont she said smiling
why

 one of the men who murdered my
brother is coming to call on me i hope
the smile died on her lips her eyes
widened on him

 you mean it but-but surely you-
you dont intend-

  were going to have a talk thats all
said tompkins good night and pleasant
dreams ill see you again dont forget
to look through your blankets for stray
lizards

  he went on to his own cell and in twenty
minutes was sound asleep

with dawn tompkins or as he was now
 to become pat ramsay wakened to
a glorious sunrise just breaking over a
transformed world as he had predicted
snow had come during the night every-
thing was covered with a soft white gar-
ment unusual but by no means unheard-of
in the desert which would be gone again in
an hour

  he shaved and made his ablutions and
got ready to travel he inspected the rifle
which haywire had left in his room and
found it good he was still looking it over
when haywire himself knocked at the door
say puffesser mesquite is out there-
all right bring him right along hold
on i want to settle with you for this gun
and wheres that revolver that sagebrush
wanted

  - got it right here puffesser-

  taking the old forty-five that was
handed him ramsay paid for his rifle and
then swiftly made ready for his visitor
he pulled down the blind of the window
partly darkening the room then rubbed his
face with talcum powder and seated him-
self without glasses or helmet with his back
to the door the rifle in his hand after
a moment came steps then a knock
come in he said

  mesquite harrison stepped into the room
and stood blinking at the swift transition
from snow-dazzle to this obscurity he was
a cadaverous person with straggling mus-
tache and rudimentary chin adenoidal
mouth and projecting front teeth his en-
tire countenance was stamped with vicious-
ness and weakness and one glance showed
ramsay that his ruse was bound to suc-
ceed

the blue

  heard ye wanted a guide said mes-
quite

  i wanted you said ramsay and i
came back to get you

  he swung his chair around so that the
light stmck his face

  mesquite harrison uttered one low gasp
and then stood absolutely petrified struck
into helpless motionless silence his mouth
opened and his piggish eyes widened into
round disks he stood with hands thrown
back against the door and a ghastly pallor
crept across his horrified countenance

  thought you were safe when you knew
i was dead up there in pinecate canon
didnt you said ramsay in a hollow
voice you thought that after shooting
me through the lungs you were safe eh
but youre not ive come back to get
you dont move a muscle or ill put a
bullet through you

  his likeness to the vanished alec ram-
say was strong-so strong that the wretched
mesquite harrison made no query about
how a ghost could shoot a rifle this in-
teresting conundrum was about the farthest
thing from mesquites mind at the moment
his distended eyes were fastened in horror
upon the face of ramsay and now a low
wail broke from him

  leave me be fer gawds sake he
howled it wasnt me it was cholo bill
and tom emery done it-i was jest trailin
along with em that day it was tom
emery fired that shot leave me be and
ill be good-

  he plumped down on his knees and his
teeth began to chatter with fright

  all right said ramsay in contempt
get up turn around and walk out that
door and walk out to the street then
start going-and keep going head for
meteorite and dont stop ill be right
back of you until you get there you cant
see me after we get out of town but ill be
there get going

  the unhappy mesquite lost no time in
obeying he flung open the door darted
outside and started for the street ram-
say followed more leisurely when he
passed through the hotel front he saw
mesquite standing outside staring back
and as ramsay appeared in his wake the
thoroughly frightened rascal uttered an-
other howtl and started for meteorite

  dont ever come back here or ill get
you called ramsay and the last he saw
of mesquite harrison the latter was plug-
ging along through the snow head down


book magazine

and arms going as he ran ramsay turned
back into the hotel office and met the stare
of haywire

   gosh said the latter whatd ye do
to him puffesser

   without replying ramsay went on back
to his room there he got his belongings
together and carried them to the car which
was standing in the street while he was
putting them into the flivver he saw has-
sayamp appear at the front door of the
hotel yawning mightily ramsay jerked
off his glasses and sun-helmet and went up
to hassayamp in the latters startled
gaze he read instant recognition for this
was the first time hassayamp had ever
seen him without the yellow goggles

  listen here said ramsay tapping
melancholy hassayamp on the arm and
boring into him with stern gaze i sup-
pose you thought that little escapade of
yours back in st johns arizona a good
many years ago had been forgotten eh
hassayamp turned white whether or
not he recognized his interlocutor as sin-
gularly like the vanished alec ramsay in
looks he certainly recognized the remark-
able change of voice and manner in the
supposed professor mention of st johns
brought the pallor to his cheeks over his
shoulder gaped haywire intensely in-
terested

  well continued ramsay it hasnt
been forgotten my friend one of my er-
rands here was to remind you of the oc-
currence if i were you i wouldnt rely
too much on the protection of sidewinder
crowfoot the theft of horses may be for-
gotten with the years but what about that
church money you stole eh

   i-ill pay it back stammered hassa-
yamp now convinced that the mormons
were on his trail

   you wont get the chance if i didnt
have other and more important fish to fry
id attend to you right now but i guess
youll keep until i get back then youll
come along with me

  hassayamp turned yet whiter the
southwest has by no means forgotten the
days of mountain meadow and the aveng-
ing angels of mormon and while in these
more settled times the followers of that
faith are certainly guiltless of any ill-doing
there is an heritage of uneasiness that
lingers about the very name of mormon
and will not be stilled

   so ramsay strode out to his car donned
goggles and helmet and went chugging

away to get his breakfast at pinecate
canon

chapter viii

gagebrush who had camped at the
 entrance of the canon listened with
hearty approval to ramsays recital of the
mornings events his roar of laughter
echoed back from the rocky walls and went
thundering away up toward the mesa

   burned if ive laughed so much since
my ol woman run off he exclaimed
shootins too good for that coyote mes-
quite anyhow hell run into jail to me-
teorite cause hes wanted there for rob-
bin an injun off the reservation last year
yessir thats how mean that pesky
critter is done robbed an injun squaw
what had been sellin beadwork to tourists
on the trains

  do you know those men he mentioned
as the actual murderers queried ramsay

  nope never heard o cholo bill-
most likely hes a halfbreed greaser sames
that cuss mendoza tom emerys dif-
ferent hes a bad man real bad got
out o jail in arizona two year back mur-
dered a rancher in the white mountains
and skipped out i reckon theres a re-
ward for him

   all right you collect all the rewards-
what im after is scalps

   that suits me perfesser she goes as
she lays whats the program

   ramsay having finished his breakfast
lighted his pipe and considered

   the thing to do of course he said
tentatively is to apprise the nearest legal
officers of conditions get the sheriff to
work and round up the gang

   sagebrush eyed him askance in no little
astonishment

   is that there your program then
no ramsays blue eyes twinkled
no it isnt i only mentioned it as the
proper thing

   if we all done the proper thing this
would be a hell of a world and sagebrush
sighed in relief i nominates that we
light a shuck out o yere go over to that
there hourglass canon and clean her up
everybody there is wanted you betcha
we dont need no warrants nor no officers
fussin around to see things is done right
nomination seconded said ramsay
promptly how far is it from here
hold on warned the desert rat this
cactus and rattlers

aint no picnic party perfesser we got to
git busy fore sidewinder gits busy but
theres no sense to rushin things we cant
take no autybile over there we got to
hike grounds durned rocky and rough
yessir were headin east on a rough and
rocky road and no mistake thats one
reason nobody aint never follered none o
that gang to the roost nobody much aint
been along this yere range for ten or twelve
year-shes got the repytation of havin
petered out you and me can probly git
there sometime tonight ease up the canon
git the lay of the land toward sunup and
git into action wipe out the hull durned
batch

  ramsay frowned thats a trifle
bloodthirsty isnt it i want those two
murderers if i can get em alive to stand
trial all right if not-

   theyre all in the same kittle snapped
sagebrush wipe em out yessir im
riled but no sense goin too fast we
got to see whos there and how many and
what things look like that there canon
is shaped like the figger x and where the
lines cross is a right narrer gap the back
end is a box canon all right with durned
steep walls and lots of timber only green
spot this side o them hills last time i
was there was ten year back when chuck
martin busted his whiffletree and we rode
over yere to find a new stick we had
some liquor along them days and chuck
he took a drap too much and went to sleep
in an op shack and when he woke up it
was dark and they was a hull passel o
phoby skunks holdin a carnival and
chuck busted up the dance fore he knowed
what it was gosh i can smell him yet
when i think of it yessir look fore
you sleep is a dad-blamed good rule to
foller in these ol shacks-and anywheres
else too i reckon well ill git the packs
made up while you clean camp

rthe two men set to work after the
flivver was laid out of sight in the
clump of pinon trees and thorny mesquite
the loads were assembled and within
twenty minutes the partners were on their
way what with grub and blankets rifle
and water-bag ramsay had all the weight
to carry that he wanted and he faced the
prospect of a full day in rocky desert
ground with a grimace

   his expectations were entirely fulfilled
sagebrush led the way skirting the high
and precipitous mesa for a time and then

the blue

striking directly off toward the hills to the
northeast the abundance of rocks showed
ramsay that no flivver could hope to cover
this ground the snow had all vanished
long since and no trace of moisture re-
mained to mark its passing

  fortunately for ramsay the old desert
rat was used to the slow burro pace and
shuffled along at a steady plodding gait
which was not difficult to sustain and
which ate up the distance slowly but surely
to anyone not used to it there was some-
thing terrible in the thought of thus shuf-
fling across the desert day in and day out
for years eternally seeking the yellow
dust and yet men did it hundreds of
them and were not happy unless doing it

  pat ramsay faced the project which lay
ahead of them unblinking the facts and
not shirking what was to be done he now
knew what before he had only conjectured
impossible as it seemed he knew it to be
true here at this back door of civilization
existed a number of men whose business
in life was robbery and if necessary mur-
der-an abnormal situation to be handled
with other than normal methods ramsay
was no innocent in the waste places he
knew that in these vast stretches of desert
country there existed strange things that
in this apparently empty basin of forgotten
seas there were still unsolved problems and
undiscovered wonders if he was to go
seeking the men who had murdered his
brother he must put away all thought of
haling them before the bar of justice the
only justice which obtained in the desert
was that of the strong hand and the in-
exorable requisitions of nature if men
offended the laws of nature a terrible
punishment was exacted from them if
they offended the laws of man as they did
every day the ordinary machinery of mans
justice could not always reach them-and
they knew it

  by gosh said sagebrush when they
halted at noon in the shade of a towering
pinnacle of rock ye done a good stroke
when ye got to work this mornin and cut
off sidewinder from them fellers yonder
yessir id think twicet or maybe three
times fore i tackled that there gent most
likely that cholo and mesquite rode in to
git supplies and cuttin them off was a
right smart piece o work wisht we had
a hoss apiece sing out next you see a
nice fat chuckwalla id like to git me a
good chunk o lizard-tail for supper per-
fesser


book magazine

defore they had left the overhanging
rock indeed sagebrush located a fine
big lizard and staged a battle royal the
lizard ensconced in a rock cranny inflated
himself and could not be dislodged for all
the tugging of sagebrush who in the end
was content with taking the tail this the
chuckwalla gladly surrendered and sage-
brush stowed it away in his pocket after
ramsay refused to share the delicacy

  the afternoon drew on they did not
hurry yet the ground was covered steadily
and no moving object broke the dun ex-
panse of glaring rock and sand gradually
they approached a patch of green high on
the hills which served as landmark but
the entrance to hourglass canon itself did
not open up before them when the sun
was drawing down to the western horizon
sagebrush halted

  no use goin on now-well be in the
canon in half an hour and cant take no
chances goin to be a clear night and
cold as hell why dont preachers make
hell a cold place perfesser dad blame if
i can see anythin ornery in hell the way
its laid out i bet it aint no hottern the
ralston desert up in nevada and that
dont stack up noways alongside what im-
perial valley used to be fore they started
growin melons and garden truck there
reckon im goin to freeze tonight thout
no fire but cant be helped lets git our
victuals washed down and then well mosey
along and take it easy till dark

  when the sun was down they moved on
again and before the last of the daylight
died into the starry radiance of night
ramsay descried the lines of the canon
opening out from the general mass of hills
ahead the night was clear with a thin
green-silver crescent of moon hanging high
but nothing could be seen of the environ-
ment though old sagebrush plodded along
without a pause a little later he broke
into speech

  trail no talkin now watch out
underfoot

  a trail indeed-at least a path beaten
by the hoofs of horses sagebrush had
need to mind his own warning for the next
moment he jumped sharply aside dropped
his pack and picked up the nearest rock to
crush a sidewinder in his path after this
both men kept a sharper watch for the
nocturnal reptiles than on the surrounding
scenery

  they had proceeded perhaps two miles
when ramsay found the canon walls

by h bedford-jones

closing in ahead apparently forming an
unbroken barrier then he began to ap-
preciate the strategic value of the place
which to anyone on the search would ap-
pear to be an empty canon while in reality
there was a narrow passage opening into
a second but completely hidden canon
this was a freak of erosion and wind-carv-
ing for the trail led them sharply to the
right and then into a black hole-a widen-
ing cleft in the rock ten feet in width and
twenty through to the other side sage-
brush halted his companion and stole for-
ward cautiously then summoned ramsay
the opening was unguarded

  passing through both men came to an
astonished halt they stood in an almost
circular bowl which so far as the deceptive
light told them was not more than a mile
in diameter closed in by gigantic walls of
rock which on the side opposite them
presented only blackness which was illu-
mined by three yellow pin-points

  lamps said sagebrush got some
shacks over there by gosh

  it was not this which had startled them
both however in their immediate vicinity
were great masses of jumbled rock fallen
from the walls that hemmed in the en-
trance at a distance of fifty feet from
them the scattered rock and sand gave
place to a thick green carpet which seemed
to cover the entire bowl and across this
carpet moved masses of horses quietly
grazing

  the explanation was simple just now
immediately after the rains this hidden box
canon was saturated with drainage from
the slopes above and behind either the
growth of grass here was natural or as was
more likely it had been sown by the oc-
cupants of the canon

  set said sagebrush slipping off his
pack and squatting down ramsay fol-
lowed suit and the desert rat softly eluci-
dated the situation

  we got things straight now perfesser
this yere crowd is right happily located
for a fact the idee is they slide acrost
the hills to the chuckwalla range and slide
back with a few hosses picked up over
there when they get a right good remuda
they drive em over to the railroad at
meteorite or maybe up north acrost the
salt pans to silver city they keep em
yere maybe six months till the hairs growed
out over the rebrand and by that time
everybodys give up looking they probly
git a lot o foals too


cactus and rattlers

  with a base of supplies at stovepipe
springs theyre safe commented ramsay
and sidewinder crowfoot is the brains of
the outfit all right what dyou want to
do

  sneak up and look things over better
let me do it when we git right close then
ill come back yere and lay up in these
yere rocks with both guns handy you cut
around and open fire on them shacks
youll jest naturally catch em penned up
and if they git away ill catch em yere
if they dont bust loose ill come over and
help you hows that strike ye per-
fesser

  first rate said ramsay what does
tom emery look like

  red whiskers cant miss him lets
mosey along

  they rose picked up their loads and
set forth

in the darkness of the upper canon with

  the stars glimmering far above the
scout was made and all things considered
it was a good scout but when it had been
ended the two men drew off together for
consultation upon both of them settled a
silent consternation for here was a factor
they had not reckoned on

  three cabins and in one of them four
men sitting playing cards a lantern swing-
ing from a rafter one was tom emery-
a brutal giant of a man with a great fringe
of flaring red whiskers and matted red hair
a murderer and escaped jailbird with a price
on his head one whom old sagebrush
did not know was a swarthy halfbreed
doubtless the cholo bill mentioned by the
dying alec ramsay-a slender furtive
man on the surface all smiles and all
deviltry beneath the third card-player
was identified as gentleman jimson an
elderly man with handsome ascetic features
and the general air of a benevolent
preacher he had escaped from a california
penitentiary three years previously where
he was serving a life term for murder and
forgery the last of the four men was a
pure mexican one manuel ximines-a
scowling sullen scoundrel from below the
border a murderer of women not all this
had given the two friends pause however
but the shrill wail of an infant from one of
the other shacks and the thin voices of
two mexican women

  women everywhere aint it hell de-
manded sagebrush when they were at a
safe distance and now what

the blue

  walk in on the four of them said
ramsay promptly and we have em
nope them cholo women would jump
us in the back in a minute then if any-
thing went wrong the bunch would scatter
in the darkness we dont know the lay
o the ground

  all right then stick to our original
plan

  sagebrush dissented with a grunt pard-
ner it means the females fight with the
men now i jest naturally cant abide
that notion nohow when it comes to put-
tin a bullet into a female i pass we got
to seprate them fellers from the females
granted assented ramsay at once
how

  there aint but one way out o this yere
canon-the front way lets you and me
go back through that hole in the wall and
wait if anybody comes we got him if
anybody leaves we got him then come
sunup we lights a fire out beyond they
see the smoke and most likely that feller
ximines comes out to investigate we got
him the other fellers come out when he
dont return-and we got em all

  good said ramsay lets go

chapter ix

a ll that night coyotes howled dismally
 upon the hills and ramsay stretched
out beside sagebrush near the hole in the
wall wakened from time to time at their
almost human cries

  the scheme proposed by the old desert
rat was simple and promised to be highly
effective it had only one drawback com-
mon to all human propositions-it failed to
take into account the dispensations of
providence not anticipating the unexpected

  the misty gray darkness that precedes
dawn was over everything when ramsay
on watch wakened sagebrush and the
desert rat sat up shivering

  gosh its cold he observed throwing
off his blankets and pulling on his boots
thus finishing dressing operations he rose
their camp was just outside the rock
crevice which gave access to the inner
canon mights well git us some hot coffee
while were makin that fire ill rustle up
some bresh along the slopes while youre
gittin the grub little skillet layin in my
pack for the side-meat we got lots o
time-they wont disciver our smoke until
after sunup


book magazine

  he shuffled off toward the slopes on the
right and disappeared in the darkness
ramsay went to work at breakfast prepar-
ing the coffee with the last of their water
and slicing up some bacon

  getting some dry and dead twigs to-
gether ramsay heaped them in readiness
to build a fire as he rose a voice sud-
denly impinged sharply on his conscious-
ness

  up with em stranger-reach high and
quick 

  he put up his hands and turned there
standing at the rock opening through which
he must have come unobserved stood the
tall stooped figure of gentleman jimson
his pistol covering ramsay

  what you doing here demanded jim-
son who you looking for

  his rifle out of reach ramsay knew
himself caught his brain worked swiftly

  im looking for tom emery he said
raising his voice in order to warn sagebrush
whose proximity was evidently unsuspected

  oh looking for tom are you jim-
son sneered on what business

  thats for him to hear returned ram-
say sidewinder told me to camp here
until morning youre jimson i spose

  the other was momentarily astonished

  what sidewinder sent you here did
he wheres mesquite

  gone to jail in meteorite i guess that
greaser with him was killed

  what jimson looked startled then he
frowned youre a cussed liar whats
this youre pulling off anyhow sidewinder
would never have told you to wait out here
before telling us all this march over here
--leave that rifle where it lays quick
now or ill drill you

the voices had risen shrill and distinct
on the quiet air of the dawn and had
quite accomplished the purpose for which
ramsay hoped jimson caught a movement
on the hillside from the corner of his eye
and turned-but his pistol did not swing
quickly enough the roar of a forty-five
crashed out then again gentleman jim-
son with a look of frightful astonishment
dropped his automatic took two staggering
steps then slumped face down

  sagebrush standing on the hillside to the
right emitted a whoop of exultation

  ye will crowd me and my pardner will
ye reckon thats one reward ill collect
suddenly his voice rose shrill hey per-
fesser look out-hosses cornin

by h bedford-jones

  ramsay already scrambling for his rifle
heard the pounding of many hoofs and
sprang up wildly startled by that shrill cry
he saw coming in upon him from the des-
ert a mass of horses one glance at sage-
brush and he caught sight of the latter
staggering out of sight-then rifles cracked
a bullet sang past his head

  with a leap ramsay darted toward his
only protection the hole in the wall he
jumped the motionless body of jimson
turned and began firing the scream of a
frantic horse answered his first shot then
bullets began to whang on the rock around
him he saw that a dozen or more horses
were charging in had a vision of two men
firing then he slipped back into the ten-
foot passage with the rush of animals at
his very heels

  as he ran for the other side a curse
broke from his lips sagebrush was shot
down and their whole scheme of action was
disrupted it was plain enough that two of
the gang were returning with stolen horses-

  they were upon him and nothing saved
him from trampling but a hasty shot from
under his arm at the report a horse
leaped high and then came down kicking
something struck ramsay as he gained the
inner opening of the passage struck him
and sent him headlong to one side he
crashed down rolled over picked himself
up a rifle roared above him the bullet
sang by his face and as he himself fired
he had a swift vision of a bearded rider
flinging out arms and pitching forward
then he was working the bolt looking for
the other horsethief as the rush of animals
swept past and went pounding up the
grassy canon no other appeared

  ramsay stood panting waiting rifle
ready twenty feet away lay the outlaw
he had shot from the saddle-but where
was the other from the other end of the
canon lifted faint shouts of men the gang
there were alarmed but it was still too
dark for them to make out anything

  something flickered from the black
depths of the passage before ramsay
could comprehend its import a lariat set-
tled over his shoulders and was jerked taut
he was fighting it instantly trying to whip
around his rifle-fighting it furiously
fiercely vainly a hoarse laugh made an-
swer then he was drawn off his feet and
hurled sprawling next instant a horse
came leaping through the opening and
started away the rider holding the rope
with ramsay dragging behind


cactus and rattlers



in the space of a few seconds terrible

  things can come to pass arms caught
just above his elbows and fast bound to
his body with the rope cutting into the
flesh ramsay was dragged along for half
a minute jerking and helpless clothes
ripped away death threatening with every
rock that loomed in his path he came to
the grass slid over it more easily heard
the outlaw yelling at his mount to increase
its speed-and all the while held on to his
rifle though it was nearly torn from his
hand

  and then came a merciful relaxation
the horse stumbled suddenly was reined
sharply in-the lariat slackened ramsay
rolled over on his side gained his feet with
a leap cocked and fired the rifle from his
hip it was a chance shot but a good one
the poor horse sank forward its outlaw
rider leaping from the saddle turned and
threw up a pistol but ramsay working
up the lariat had ejected the shell and now
fired again the outlaw pitched forward
on his face shot through the brain

  all this took place with incredible rapid-
ity indeed it must have passed swiftly
for no man can long survive the dragging
at a lariats end as it was ramsay knew
himself bruised and hurt torn and scratched
-but in essentials undamaged he was
not thirty yards from the passage and
turned to it as he did so that dark cleft
in the rock wall vomited a spat of flame
and to the smashing report of a pistol a
bullet whined past him

  instantly ramsay whirled threw himself
at the dead horse gained it and took shel-
ter another report and another bullet
went screaming over him he answered it
with a blind shot panting he realized his
intolerable position he was out here in
the open trapped and from the shouts at
the other end of the canon he knew the
three men there would soon be sweeping
down on him swiftly he weighed the
chances for a dash toward one of the side
slopes-and then he saw a grim thing yet
one which spelled his salvation

  he had supposed that these shots from
the passage must have come from a third
horsethief now he perceived a figure take
shape in the grayness and was about to
fire when he saw it staggering forward and
checked himself it was the tall figure of
jimson mortally wounded and yet still
alive blindly reeling on pistol in hand as
ramsay waited the pistol dropped for a
moment jimson stood there swaying then

the blue

dropped slowly to his knees and fell in a
limp heap

  in a flash ramsay visualized what was
now sure to take place it was his one
chance and a sure chance none of those
three outlaws at the head of the canon
would know what had happened here he
leaped up and imagined that he could see
riders coming from the gray background
of the canon that he was unseen he knew
well enough next instant he was running
for the heaped-up rocks near the passage
as he went by jimson he saw the dying
man was still alive and trying to rise but
kept on and a moment later threw himself
down in cover of the boulders

  no time to ask after sagebrush now-
heres the great chance to clean up the
whole gang  he thought as he reloaded his
rifle and drew long deep breaths to calm
himself by glory we havent done so
badly so far either three of them done
for now they came asking for it and they
got it if things work right ill get these
last three scoundrels alive-ah theyre
coming all right

lie waited eyes glittering bloody and
bruised figure tense rifle ready now
the gray darkness was clearing off and the
clearer light of day was breaking through
coming across the grassy canon at a break-
neck gallop were three riders impeded at
first by the mass of frightened and rushing
horses now free of the remuda the three
were plunging toward the passage and the
three outstretched figures lying there in the
open one of those figures was moving
slowly crawling upward jimson dying
hard got to one knee and remained thus
swaying

  the three outlaws swept on straight for
the figure of jimson and the man in the
lead was tom emery his mass of flaming
whiskers marking him clearly all three
had rifles and were girded with gun-belts
ramsay grinned excitedly as he waited out
of sight

  they dont know whats happened he
thought in exultation jimson is baiting
them right into the trap-

  jimson was not forty feet away from
him and the three outlaws came thundering
down with shouted queries and wild oaths
of rage as they drew closer ramsay
could see them looking from jimson to the
girdling masses of rock and knew that he
was out of their sight tom emery was in
the lead riding like a centaur his face like
book magazine



a red blur behind him were the sullen
scowling ximines and the more dapper
halfbreed cholo bill eyes glittering like
dots of jet

  they came hurtling down upon jimson
threw themselves from the saddle and gath-
ered around him with a burst of excited
speech but they came too late for jim-
son swaying toppled over as they reached
him and lay quiet-this time forever the
three stared one at another but only for an
instant

  stick em up-pronto commanded
ramsays voice drop the rifles

a raging oath burst from emery all
three turned facing the rock wall and
the passage dismounted caught in the
open their three dead comrades to serve
as warning they comprehended instantly
that they were trapped snared mercilessly

in silence they obeyed the mandate but
their faces were eloquent as they dropped
the rifles and elevated their arms

  tom emery continued ramsay his
voice cool and deadly in its slight drawl
you and cholo bill are wanted for the
murder of alec ramsay last year ximines
you can come along on general principles
you take your own pistol and drop it over-
board then relieve your two friends of
their weapons leave em all in a pile i
dont need much of an excuse to put a bul-
let into you so watch out you dont give
it to me

  the scowling mexican deposited his own
pistol and those of the others in the dust

  now tep forward ramsay rose rifle
at his shoulder step forward please

all three-thats right walk right through
the hole in the wall and dont walk too
fast the hand is quicker than the foot
gentlemen now into the hole-you first
senor ximines then cholo bill and mr
emery last close together and slowly

  he strode forward as the three came to
the passage that gave on to the outer canon
their eyes glittered on him with unspeak-
able rage but they said not a word in the
order assigned they entered the cleft and
ramsay brought up the rear with the muz-
zle of his rifle thrust against the back of
the gigantic emery whose red whiskers
were bristling with suppressed fury ram-
say chuckled as he marched them forward

  i expect youre due for a shave before
long mr emery and a free haircut to
boot keep right ahead of each other
gentlemen and walk straight out into the

by h bedford-jones

daylight when you are safely taken care
of well all start out and have a nice little
walk over to town and interview mr crow-
foot now everybody four steps forward
then halt and about-face

dy this time the full morning light was
spreading over everything and the
three captives left the rock-cleft and
marched forward as directed ramsay
not daring to take his eyes from them fol-
lowed for a pace or two and then halted
as they turned and faced his rifle for a
moment he met the savage gaze of emery-
then the latter suddenly looked up behind
ramsay and his eyes widened in surprise

   ramsay cast one startled glance over his
shoulder he saw to his utter consterna-
tion a horse close pressed against the rock
wall to the left of the opening and holding
the reins in one hand and in the other a
leveled pistol-sidewinder crowfoot for
an instant those glittery gray eyes held
ramsay paralyzed

  careful with that gun warned side-
winder a deadly whine to his voice grab
it tom then grab this gent-and do it
careful hes got to do some talkin real
soon tie him up and leave him be
ramsay knew better than to resist ut-
terly dismayed dumbfounded by the simple
manner in which he had been trapped in
the very moment of victory he let himself
be seized hurled to the ground and then
none too gently be bound hand and foot
a swift search and he was disarmed

   a flood of curses burst loose and for a
moment he thought the mexican would
stamp on him in rage but sidewinder in-
terfered and quieted the noise

  whats happened here he snapped
emery made profane response

  dunno the boys come in with them
hosses they went after but they come dead
jimson come out to meet em and hes
dead this feller jumps us says were
wanted for killin ramsay last year what
is he-sheriff or detective

   thats what well find out said side-
winder he sure played hell around here
didnt he well im dead for something
to eat any of his friends around
nope i reckon he done played a lone
hand said emery not without a trace of
admiration you aint seen no one out
here

  no said sidewinder nary a sign
this hoss of mine is clear done up and
staggering i seen what happened from
cactus and rattlers

the passage and come back to lay for him
-and got him tom take charge of him
and walk him in ill take your hoss and
ride over to camp this gent has played
hell in town as well as here i been on my
way since yesterday noon-had to come
all the way on hossback leave the hoss
here-hell wander in after he comes
around all ready boys-lets go

emmery jerked ramsay to his feet cast
loose his ankles and propelled him for-
ward into the passage he went dumbly un-
resisting appalled by the disaster which
had overwhelmed him

   behind them the outer canon was empty
of life save for the horse which sidewinder
had ridden and which stood with legs wide
apart head drooping exhausted and spent
red and gold streaked across the sky as
the first fingers of sunrise reached up to the
zenith presently the horse still saddled
and bridled made a convulsive movement
and came out from among the rocks and
stood white with lather he was still
standing there twenty minutes later when
the first rays of sunlight struck down from
the hilltops and smote all the desert spaces
into gold and purple and up on the hill-
side stirred something that presently took
definite shape this was sagebrush beam

   the desert rat painfully gained his feet
staggered forward lost his balance and
came sprawling down among the rocks he
lay quiet for a while blood spreading
across the grizzled expanse of his tangled
beard then warmed by the sun he lifted
himself again feebly gained his feet and
came tottering across the sand to where the
horse stood watching him for a little he
clung to the saddle helpless after a time
he made an effort to draw himself up
cursed vividly if weakly and at the second
effort made shift to mount

   the exhausted horse submitted to its fate
and started out into the desert with sage-
brush limp and clinging to the pommel

chapter x

the three shacks at the head of hour-
glass canon were set amid trees and
near a trickling brook which in another
three weeks would be only a summers
memory and which was lost in the grass a
hundred yards distant ramsay was al-
lowed to sit against a tree and was set
free of his bonds while his four captors

the blue



surrounded him the two frightened mex-
ican women wretched creatures who be-
longed to ximines and cholo bill fetched
coffee and tortillas

  ramsay had been studying his captors
ximines was the most dangerous because
the most vicious and debased cholo bill
was far above him in character tom
emery had some traces of humor in his
brutal countenance all three of them were
distinctly perturbed and uneasy yet de-
ferred everything to sidewinder and ram-
say perceived that crowfoot himself be-
neath that grayish mask of a face was
more alarmed than he cared to betray

  now you going to talk or do we got
to make ye demanded sidewinder his
reptilian gaze fastened on ramsay the
latter smiled slightly

  you give me a share in your breakfast
and let me get my pipe going and ill swap
all the information you want

  fair enough grunted sidewinder and
summoned one of the women

d amsay found his tortillas excellent and

	 the coffee passable and attacked his
breakfast heartily his chief concern was
for sagebrush the latter was either dead
in which case he could not be aided or else
was wounded in which case he was better
off without sidewinders help in either
event his participation in the mornings af-
fair was not suspected and must not be
suspected in all other respects frank
speech was the best policy

  the meal finished ramsay got his pipe
going while the other four rolled cigarettes
and sidewinder started his catechism

  first off what kind of an officer are
you anyhow county state or fedral
neither one ramsay chuckled my
names pat ramsay i came here to get
mr emery yonder also cholo bill for the
murder of my brother alec last year you
were a party to it also

  emery started to speak but sidewinder
flashed him a look that held him silent

  it wasnt no murder said sidewinder
it was a straight killin-

  no use passing any lies said ramsay
quietly lets all stick to the truth alec
left a message for me also the deed to that
property he bought from harrison-told me
all about it i found em in pinecate canon
the other day the deeds gone in to the
recorders office so has an explanation of
the circumstances i expect the sheriff will
be along any time to look things over
book magazine

a n outburst of startled oaths broke from
the three outlaws but sidewinder only
grinned and put a hand to his pocket he
drew forth an unopened letter ramsay
in dismay recognized it as that containing
the deed which he had registered with hay-
wire johnson

  here yare said sidewinder and tossed
it to him with a malignant grin i reckon
ye mights well keep it serve for identifi-
cation darned good thing i took a look
through that mail-sack fore it went out
yesterday eh whatd you do to hassa-
yamp anyhow he got miss gilmans
money took mesquites hoss and beat it for
parts unknown

  ramsay although he flinched under the
blow rallied quickly

  i jogged his memory about a job he
pulled off down in arizona before coming
here

  and ye sure give mesquite a scare
reckon hes still goin so you aint no of-
ficer eh you just come nosing in here on
your own hook eh well youve sure
played hell i wonder how you can set
there and eat and smoke and laugh after
wipin out three good men this morning
aint you got no conscience dont it mean
nothin to you that yeve killed three men
ramsay shrugged

  it doesnt worry you to bring in people
from outside and cheat them or murder
them does it he retorted and it
doesnt worry anyone to wipe out a rattler
you fellows and desert rattlers are about in
the same class

  and youll be in the same class with
your brother when we get through with
ye said sidewinder acidly

  he knows too much said ximines in
spanish kill him now quickly

  you back down and rest your heels
snapped sidewinder im running this
show now ramsay youre alone in this
deal-you and miss gilman-

  shes not in it broke out ramsay
quickly alarmed by the mans look

  dont ye lie to me you and her have
been carryin on together got to town
about the same time and been thick ever
since she fooled me at first all right but
now im wide awake and ready to strike
youve earned your victuals now shut up

ywith this sidewinder turned to the
three outlaws and briefly described
miss gilmans activities while ramsay
listened in acute anxiety

by h bedford-jones

  all good things have an end he fin-
ished weve just about reached the end
of our rope the thing to do now is to
bust up camp better get them women and
the kid off right now with hosses let em
ride in to town and jose garcia will take
care of em until youre ready to send for
em then get busy with a running-iron
and a knife and well go over them hosses
on hand any that cant be worked over
leave here youll have a right good
remuda and you three fellers can run em
up to silver city emery you know how
to get there across the salt pans dont ye
tom emery nodded in silence but jerked
his thumb at ramsay

  dont worry none about him first
get them women off then get busy with
the irons well be until night gettin the
remuda worked over and in good shape
then early in the morning well ride over
to pinecate canon with this inquisitive pil-
grim that fool woman is goin out there
sometime today to camp and see about
where to build a shack well nab her and
her car -hey ramsay wheres that
rat sagebrush

  last i saw of him was out in the des-
ert said ramsay truthfully he didnt
fancy any acquaintance with miss gilman
and got right huffy over her being around
so he run off eh blamed if that aint
old sagebrush all over sidewinder
chuckled dryly wheres your car

  at pinecate canon

  all right sidewinder eyed his three
men ye see we cant afford to take no
chances if we kill this hombre there may
be questions asked-and whatd we do with
the gilman woman i dont aim to murder
a woman

  give her to me suggested ximines
with a grin

  you go plumb to hell snapped side-
winder i dont guess any of us want a
double murder charge follering us so
heres the program with them two leave
em in pinecate canon with some grub
they aint going to walk away from there
in a hurry-

  hamstring him ximines gave ram-
say a scowling glance

  good idea approved sidewinder with
a nod fix him sos he cant travel any-
how then ill have jose garcia come over
there from town and camp out to keep an
eye on the two of em you boys run the
remuda up to silver city sell her and then
scatter ill get sold out in stovepipe


cactus and rattlers

springs and disappear three weeks ought
to fix us up all around then garcia can
remove himself likewise by the time ram-
say and that fool woman get out to where
they can tell their story-let em tell it
thats the general scheme we can fix the
details later hows it suit

  fine with me said tom emery paw-
ing his red whiskers

  cholo bill nodded bueno but my
woman she go with me and the remuda

  mine too growled ximines

  then get busy sidewinder rose tie
up this gent

o	am say despite his protestations was
 seized and lashed firmly to a tree after
which he was ignored for the remainder of
the morning he was somewhat relieved
by the exposition of sidewinders plans
since these did not at least include murder
this relief was more than balanced how-
ever by the menace directed toward ethel
gilman

  the hours dragged past while sidewinder
and his three companions worked like
slaves the entire band of horses num-
bering nearly forty had to be gone over
each animal had to be examined carefully
and his brand worked upon with running
irons to make it accord with the brands
used by sidewinder while the other marks
also had to be altered to suit

  there was an hours lay-off at noon
when ramsay was given temporary liberty
then he was closely confined again and the
work went on five of the unavailable
horses were turned into a small corral be-
hind the shacks and one of the women was
sent to the outer canon to bring in the
horse which sidewinder had left there she
returned later with word that the animal
had wandered off out of sight

  it was nearly sunset when the work was
concluded and the four men weary to the
point of exhaustion came in and flung
themselves down the two women had pre-
pared a meal which was eaten hurriedly
then ramsay who had been released tem-
porarily was again bound and relegated to
his post against the tree ordering the
women to wake them at midnight side-
winder and the others rolled up and were
asleep at once

  benumbed by his many and tight lash-
ings stiff and sore with his hurts and
bruises ramsay resigned himself to the in-
evitable and after a little dropped off into
a doze from this he was wakened to find

the blue

ximines cutting him free and playfully jab-
bing him with the point of a knife as he cut

  so leetle senor you come weeth me
eh in the starry darkness the white
teeth of the swarthy mexican outlaw
flashed faintly you ride with manuel
continued the man in spanish which ram-
say comprehended perfectly and while
you ride conmigo we shall talk eh

  ramsay rubbing his stiffened limbs
glanced around and saw that they were
alone he gathered his muscles-

  careful senor  the muzzle of a pistol
touched him turn and walk to the
horses

  five hundred dollars and a get-away
ximines he said softly if you turn me
free

  the other growled bah if you have
that much money i shall take it anyway
and take the pretty senorita too when
we get to that canon of pinecates eh then
this sidewinder will go away and maybe
manuel will come back eh and you will
not be able to object my little senor
vamanos to the horses

cidewinder called ramsay hope-
less turned and went to the horses
saddled by the other men he was put into
a saddle his feet roped to the stirrups and
his arms bound then ximines without
orders but for reasons of his own impro-
vised a dirty bandana into a gag which
he lashed about the jaw of ramsay

  bring him along said sidewinder im-
patiently and mounted leading the way
the others trailed out after him after
cholo bill rode ramsay the reins of his
horse held by ximines at his stirrup as
they rode out across the grassy canon the
mexican laughed and spoke softly to the
captive

  ho little senor what is it i read in
the newspaper that the wise men say in
your town of new york eh they say
that the americano he is not civilized-
that the americano of the west he is an
animal ho well when i come back to
that canon of the little tumbling bugs
senor you shall see how we treat gringos
dogs of americanos in my country and
you will not be able to walk for i shall cut
your legs behind-que lastima what a
pity little senor and when i kiss the
senorita eh it will be amusing to hear
you curse uncivilized americano

  ramsay now perceived why he had been
gagged by the mexican and beneath the


book magazine



raging fury that the taunts and threats
roused in him beneath wonder that on the
lips of such a man he should find the smart
sayings of the radicals of new yorks east
side slowly mounted a growing horror at
the prospect for he comprehended that
this swarthy mexican whose cigarettes had
such a queer and unholy odor was a smoker
of the marihuana weed-a monster beside
whom the cocaine fiend was as a pale angel
a creature debased and degenerate whose
one craving was for blood for cruelty for
torture

  so the five riders passed through the hole
in the wall and came out upon the lonely
starlit desert and headed for the pinecate
mesa and upon the hills the coyotes
howled dismal orisons to the stars

chapter xi

a nother dawn was breaking when the
five riders approached pinecate canon
and the sun-spears were thrusting across
the eastern sky the lower reaches of the
rocky canon were desolate and empty save
for the figure of a saddled and bridled
horse moving about sidewinder with a
grunt of recognition broke the silence

  theres that cayuse of mesquites
now-started for town and stopped on the
way probly smelled water here

  and yonders the auto said tom
emery with a jerk of his head two of
em 

  there was no need to question ramsay
about his car for that of ethel gilman had
been thrust beside it into the cover of the
trees and mesquite clump so that both cars
stood protected from sun and dew but
plain to be seen sidewinder flung them
a glance then turned his horse into the
canon

  come along-ride as far as we can any-
how her place is quite a ways up

  the five rode slowly up the canon until
they came to the spot where ramsay had
found that cigarette-case here sidewinder
drew rein since it was becoming increas-
ingly harder for the horses to climb ahead
was the bend in the canon

  manuel you stay here with ramsay
youd better stick here too tom come
ahead when i call you come with me
bill

  sidewinder dismounted and with the
dapper cholo bill swinging along beside
him ascended the rocky floor of the canon

by h bedford-jones

on foot a faint thread of smoke began
climbing into the sky from somewhere
around the bend sunrise in all its glory
was spreading a riot of color across the
heavens

  some distance above them was a great
boulder huge as a house in the center of
the rapidly narrowing canon it was a rich
and ruddy rose-pink in the first sunlight
and was split squarely in two with a num-
ber of small pinon trees growing from the
split water came from it came from the
canon above it also and ran down into sev-
eral pools and short falls it was the
evanescent water of the desert springtime
giving a short-lived existence to lilies and
masses of flowers on either hand above
this boulder and to its left could be seen
the brown outline of a small tent with the
figure of ethel gilman tending a fire close
by sidewinder raised his voice in a hail
and waved his hand

  leave the talk to me now he growled
its all right-shes alone here dont
want to frighten her scare a fool woman
and shes like a locoed horse

  seguro senor assented the halfbreed
with a flash of his white teeth sidewinder
now that the girl had seen them turned
and sent a stentorian hail down the canon
bidding emery come along up then he
started climbing again to where the girl
stood beside her little fire staring at the
arrivals in alarm and fear that could not
be wholly veiled

  morning miss called sidewinder as
they approached her camp hows every-
thing

  all right thanks she returned low-
voiced cbviously startled

  i wa goin by with some friends o
mine said sidewinder puffing with the
climb and thought wed stop in and see
if you were all right -bill rustle up some
firewood for the lady

fholo bill smiled and went about his
 task sidewinder approached the girl

  were going to leave ramsay with you
a spell he said hes a mite scratched
up but aint hurt to speak of fell off a
hoss i reckon miss wheres that pistol
of yours lets have a look at it

  he did not miss her start at ramsays
name his gray eyes glittered on her bored
into her and as she met that deadly gaze
there was a struggle in her face

  you want-my pistol she faltered

  if you please maam
cactus and rattlers

  her hand went to her bosom and pro-
duced a small flat automatic still she
hesitated a surge of anger coming into her
eyes-then as she looked past sidewinder
she saw the other three figures turning the
bend at once she held out the weapon

  there now what you need not pre-
tend that you want to help me

  sidewinder took the weapon and thrust
it out of sight

  we aint goin to hurt ye not a mite
he said harshly we got ramsay where
we want him and neither one of ye is go-
ing to do any talkin thats all were
goin to leave him and you here and fix it
sos yell stay here a spell nothin to be
scared of miss if youve got any grub
lets have some ill send ye out plenty
from town as soon as we get back the
waterll last ye long enough so theres
nothin to be scared of

  ill get what i have she said quietly
then turned and went into the tent-whence
she presently reappeared with coffee
and bacon coffee-pot and skillet cholo bill
came in with an armload of brush which
he heaped over the fire arranging several
stones to hold the coffee-pot a moment
later tom emery strode up followed by
ximines and ramsay who was still gagged
and his arms bound miss gilman stood
staring at him wide-eyed-this scratched
and bruised and helpless man with the gar-
ments hanging in shreds about him was
somewhat different from the pat ramsay
she had known previously

  i reckon he needs a shave maam
sidewinder chuckled but thatll keep
set him against that rock manuel the
lady can let him loose after were gone get
some water tom-the quicker we get a
bite to eat and get off the better

rmsregarding their curious glances
miss gilman looking only at the figure
of ramsay returned to her tent and sat
down before it sidewinder and his com-
panions managed a makeshift bite to eat
and a swallow of warm coffee apiece then
sidewinder rose

  well leave the hosses here wthich of
you boys can drive a car got to take em
both to town with us

  i can said tom emery

  all right-

  somebody better stay and watch things
and attend to the horses spoke up manuel
ximines who was rolling one of his evil-
smelling cigarettes it would be foolish to

the blue

leave horses here wthy not let me stay
i have nothing to do in town

  sidewinder nodded with a slight look of
chagrin at the slip he had so nearly made
to have left the horses here unwatched
would indeed have been fatal

  all right he said curtly you stay
dont bother the lady none better go on
down to the lower canon ill send a driver
back with the other boys and a load of
grub in one o the cars then you boys
get back to hourglass in a hurry and get
started ill have jose garcia out here by
morning to ride herd on things

  and shall i hamstring this hombre
now asked ximines gesturing with his
cigarette toward ramsay who was glad
that miss gilman could not understand the
mexican tongue

  let him wait till tonight youll likely
need help to hold him down and we aint
got any time to waste now come on
boys

  with this sidewinder started down the
canon tom emery and cholo bill at his
heels manuel ximines however remained
sitting where he was a thin smile on his
black-avised features in his glittering dark
eyes the wild cruelty and the cunning that
mark the marihuana-smoker

jot until the three departing figures
were out of sight around the bend did
the girl move then as ximines showed
no intention of leaving she rose to her feet

  well she demanded sharply i sup-
pose i may release mr ramsay

  ximines turned his head and surveyed
her under that gaze she shrank and the
color ebbed from her cheeks

  you stay quiet or i shoot heem with
this the mexican resumed his cigarette and
stared again down the canon

  the girl flashed a terrified wondering
look at ramsay who had drawn closer a
step or two his eyes vainly trying to
give her a message of warning terrified her
the more and she stood motionless before
the tent ximines who perhaps wanted to
let sidewinder and the other two men get
well away paid her no attention but
smoked on reflectively and stared down the
canon he had drawn his pistol however
and now held it idly in his lap

  ramsay arms bound and gagged as he
was was more terrified than the girl he
knew that ximines might at any instant
leap into stark blood-madness or wild pas-
sion alienists declare that the man who


book magazine

thinks himself about to explode is the most
dangerous of all maniacs but men on the
border know that more dangerous than any
maniac is the smoker of marihuana so
with the intention of quietly working his
way toward the girl in a desperate hope
that she might be able to release his bound
arms ramsay continued his slow forward
advance

  then sudden as the flashing stroke of a
snake ximines was on his feet pistol out

  one more step little senor and i cut
your throat and drink your blood he ex-
claimed a wild and lurid glare in his eyes
a cry broke from the girl

  stop leave us alone-go on down
and look after those horses she faced
him as he turned to her grinning despite
the terror that was upon her she met his
grin defiantly bravely go on down the
canon as you were told to do

  ximines thrust away his pistol and took
a step toward her glaring eyes gripped
upon her

  manuel has come to take you little
senorita of the white throat he declared
in soft spanish and if the girl could not
understand his words his manner was be-
yond all mistake come to me little
cooing dove i shall show you how we
treat the gringo senoritas in my country

  ramsay hurled himself forward frantic
with horror flung himself at the mexican
ximines grinned avoided the rush deftly
tripped the bound man and then struck him
with an open-handed blow that sent him
headlong among the rocks next instant
with a sudden and unexpected lurch for-
ward he was upon ethel gilman and had
caught her in both arms

  come senorita-

  she struck him across the face staggering
him and struck him again so that he loosed
her and fell back hand to eyes a wild
scream burst from him and he whipped
out a knife swaying as he stood

  ha i shall drink your blood for that
blow white-throat  he yelled

  ramsay pulling himself up saw the
mexican start forward knew himself help-
less to intervene then he saw something
else

  the flap of the brown tent was shoved
aside and in the opening protruded the red
nose the tangled whiskers the sharp little
eyes of sagebrush beam the mexican
saw that movement also and furious as he
was halted and shifted hand to pistol but
he was too late

by h bedford-jones

  i reckon yeve crowded us far enough
growled sagebrush the roar of a forty-
five barked out and lifted thunderously
along the canon walls

chapter xii

cagebrush dragging himself from the
 tent but not rising called to ramsay

  kick that skunks knife over yere and
ill cut ye free

  ramsay who had been stupefied by the
appearance of the desert rat obeyed the
order and in another moment was rubbing
his arms to get rid of the numbness ethel
gilman had dropped in a heap mercifully
unconscious and almost at her side lay
manuel ximines his contorted features
staring at the sky

  where on earth did you come from
demanded ramsay man i thought you
were dead

  so i was and sagebrush chuckled
but i come to life again found a hoss and
got over yere the lady give me a lift up
the canon and took care on me i got a
busted head and a bullet in the gizzard but
im gettin all right yessir like yava-
pai ferris down phoenix way time o the
border raids some greasers drapped him
into a dry wash with two-three bullets
then some sojers come along and the
greasers crawled into the wash for shelter
and yavapai set up with a gun in each
hand and plugged ten of em the leventh
got away and yavapai said hed ha been
cured pronto if hed got the leventh yes-
sir same here pluggin that there pizen
skunk sure done me good id have done
it earlier only i didnt figger on drawin
sidewinder back yere spose you drap him
into the canon fore the lady wakes up git
his gun too

  ramsay stooped above the dead mexican
and found that the latters automatic was
his own pistol which had been taken from
him when captured at one side of the
upper flat was a great bunch of yucca its
spiny perpendicular leaves topped by the
remains of a glorious cluster of creamy
bell-like blooms carrying the body to this
ramsay dropped it out of sight

  dont forget the spot said sagebrush
anxiously i reckon theres a reward for
that gent down south

  never mind talking now said ram-
say with a glance at the unconscious girl
got any more grub in there then lay it


cactus and rattlers

out-get breakfast started anyhow
he went to the pool below sluiced head
and neck and arms with the cold water
then he turned to the girl and lifted her
head in his arms he was about to bathe
her face when her eyes opened and looked
up into his startled and wide in recognition

   youre all right he said quietly and
smiled sit still a minute young lady
and take it easy

   color rising in her cheeks the girl sat
up then sprang to her feet staring around
where is he

  he done went away maam said
sagebrush solemnly yessir that mex
done seen the error of his ways and got
converted i never seen a mex get con-
verted so sudden before neither nor with
such good results

  and we owe sagebrush a vote of thanks
for converting him added ramsay turn-
ing to the fire breakfast ready in a
minute miss gilman have you any bis-
cuits cooked up

  yeres some store biscuits sagebrush
tossed out a package say perfesser im
right worried about somethin

  about what asked ramsay

months store o magazines there and im
readin a long story in one of em i been
thinking a lot about that there story in the

to finish it if sidewinder steals em-
he wont said ramsay laughing to
himself he wont ill nab those two
friends of his when they come back with
the car this afternoon and well all drop in
on sidewinder tonight and surprise him
sagebrush was sitting up and they joined
him all three feeling considerably benefited
by the coffee and a bite of food miss gil-
man asked no more questions about
ximines and ramsay outlined what had
taken place in hourglass canon

  how badly is our friend here hurt
ramsay asked of miss gilman after he
had ended his story

  hell be on his feet in a few days i
took out the bullet-ive had a little ex-
perience nursing-and theres nothing very
much the matter with him he lost a good
deal of blood

  bloods cheap sagebrush grinned as
he leaned back comfortably he seemed
to have quite gotten over all his aversion
to this particular woman best thing for

the blue

blood is good fat lizard-meat ill get me
a likely chuckwalla and lay him in the
ashes and feed up some says pack-rats
make good meat but i dunno ive et
rattlesnake but my gosh a feller has to
draw the line somewhere and i draws it
at pack-rats so youre figgering on
roundin up sidewinder tonight perfesser
yes responded ramsay if i can get
tom emery and cholo bill-

  ye cant do it noways said sagebrush
with savage emphasis dont be a durned
fool and try it perfesser even if ye got
them two fellers covered would they give
in again not much theyd figger that
one of em would go down the other might
plug ye-and theyd take the chance
yessir after all thats happened theyd
go for ye gun or no gun ye took em
by sprise the first time but there wont
be no second time the only way to get
em is to drop em cold and get em dead
im no murderer said ramsay quietly
and im going to get em one way or
the other so stop your argument miss
gilman why didnt you put sagebrush into
your car and take him to town when he
showed up here

  he wasnt in shape to stand it said
the girl he got here only last night half
dead and very weak from loss of blood i
had to give him instant attention get out
the bullet and bandage him up i should
think youd compliment me on the recovery
of my patient instead of finding fault
ramsay smiled im not finding fault
except that i wish you were out of here
well shall we go down and attend to those
horses wed better rid them of saddles
and bridles and herd them as far up the
canon as possible we have until tonight
to lay our plans and we must get the
flivver that brings those rascals back here
as well as the two men themselves

  then yed better figger on shootin first
and fastest snapped out sagebrush

d am say laughed and made no response

	 as he started down the canon with
miss gilman at his side when they stood
beside the great boulder of pink granite
with the pinon trees growing out of the
cleft above he paused

  this is where my brother came he
said looking around i suppose hes
buried somewhere near here-if hes buried
at all and theres gold in these rocks
its a beautiful place said the girl
softly staring at the pool with its great


book magazine



clusters of yucca flowers and lilies i
suppose these flowers will all be gone in a
few weeks mr ramsay

  he gave her a whimsical look cant
you make it pat yet

  she shook her head gayly enough not
yet look up there above the boulder-
what a site that would be for a house 

  you can have it he said starting on
again i want none of this place-id
never get away from the thought of poor
alec no the place you should see is
hourglass canon theres a real beauty-
spot with water the year around if i
were you id grubstake old sagebrush
and set him to work looking for gold in
this canon my brother alec was no fool
and if he thought there was gold here in
paying quantities it is probably here
then you come over to hourglass canon
with me and start your chicken-ranch

  she gave him a laughing look you
own that other place then

  no but i will own it as soon as the
papers can be put through do you want
half

  tell you later she returned and
pointed there are the horses

ruring the next half-hour ramsay and
miss gilman were busy in the extreme
they unsaddled the five horses got the
poor beasts free of bridles and then started
to drive them up the canon as far as the
bend having found some of his own sup-
plies lying cached among the trees ramsay
left the girl to handle the horses and him-
self turned back down to the mouth of the
canon

  there where the canon gave on to the
open desert he approached the clump of
pinon and mesquite and dragged forth
the pack of supplies which he had seen

it had evidently been flung out of his car
by sidewinder he stooped to open the
pack and examine its contents-then he
suddenly stood up a queer noise had
startled him a noise which made him
glance incredulously at the sky an air-
plane

  no he turned and stood transfixed
there approaching at full speed leaping
and bounding on the rough desert floor
was one of the two vanished flivvers and
all three men were in it

  he stood staring helpless not daring to
produce the pistol from his pocket and open
fire that might have been his best
chance yet he neglected it with a grind-

by h bedford-jones

ing squeal of brakes the car rushed down
to a halt ten feet away sidewinder leaped
out in the cloud of dust followed by tom
emery and cholo bill

 manuel wheres ximines de-
manded sidewinder hastily

  up the canon ramsay waved his
hand whats the matter

  sidewinder turned to the two men who
had rifles in their hands obviously
something very much was the matter for
they were pouring out oaths at sight of
the horses and were in frantic haste

  go get manuel and the hosses-quick 
snapped sidewinder this is as far as
they can get in their car-we got the
hosses and they aint got any move durn
ye

  the two men stood their rifles against
the car and started away toward the star-
ing figure of miss gilman and the slowly
moving horses

chapter xiii

cidewinder stood snarling malevo-
 lently at ramsay his glittering gray
eyes filled with a greenish light his gray
mask of a face bitter to see

whats happened demanded ramsay

  hells to pay thats what if i thought
you were behind it id leave you here to
the buzzards dunno but what i will any-
how

  ramsay frowning in perplexity came
closer to him

  what do you mean he inquired
sidewinder flung out a hand toward the
desert behind him

  i mean that the sheriffs got on our
trail thats what probly trailed that last
bunch of hosses now we got to get along
to hourglass canon and well take you
and the girl sos ye wont do no talkin

  oh said ramsay and then lifted his
eyes to the desert is that dust caused
by their car

  an oath on his lips sidewinder whirled
-and ramsay struck

  he struck straight and hard mercilessly
so and his fist caught sidewinder just be-
hind the ear the little man was knocked
off his feet knocked headlong into the
radiator of the car and fell in a limp and
senseless heap stunned

  ramsay carried off his balance by the
furious energy of his own blow staggered
as he did so a pistol barked and a bullet
cactus and rattlers



scraped his very hair he came around to
see tom emery and cholo bill who were
not yet fifty feet away in the act of firing
on him

  a leap and he was behind the car no
protection here from heavy bullets-but he
had his own pistol out now and was tak-
ing his chances a bullet crashed into the
frame of the car another smashed the
windshield ramsay was firing rapidly
but coolly now he ducked swiftly to the
other end of the car darted out into full
sight took two quick sure shots he saw
cholo bill go down and lie quiet then
emery came for him on the run red
whiskers flaming in the sunlight pistol
spitting

  ramsay stepped out deliberately and
took aim

a bullet streaked fire between arm
and side searing his ribs-but to his
shot tom emerys giant figure came crash-
ing forward rolled over once and then lay
sprawled out for a moment ramsay
stood quiet scarcely daring to realize that
he was unhurt save for scratches until he
saw ethel gilman running down the canon
toward him

  then he sprang forward and leaned over
emery only to rise at once and hurry to
the side of cholo bill just in time too
for the halfbreed leg broken by a bullet
was trying to reach his fallen pistol ram-
say kicked the weapon away and cholo
bill with a low groan relaxed into uncon-
sciousness as ramsay obtained the out-
laws knife the girl arrived on the scene

he looked up at her with a slow laugh

  sagebrush said it couldnt be done but
he was only partly right emerys gone
can you fix up some sort of bandage for
this chap after i get his arms lashed be-
hind him his legs broken i think the
sheriff is on his way here according to
sidewinder-and ill have to attend to that
gentleman before he wakes up weve got
him and weve got cholo bill and its a
good haul

  as the white-faced girl nodded and knelt
ramsay lashed the arms of the wounded
man firmly behind him with the gay silk
kerchief that had been at cholo bills neck
then rose and ran back to the car here
again he had not an instant to lose for
sidewinder crowfoot was stirring was
dinging to the car and trying to haul him-
self up knowing with what incredible

by h bedfordjones

swiftness the man could strike ramsay did
not hesitate but stooped with a blow that
drove sidewinder prostrate again then
flung himself upon the fallen man and in
five minutes had him disarmed and firmly
bound hand and foot

  he rejoined the girl to find her finishing
her task as well as circumstances would
permit and as she took his hand to rise
he saw a change come into her face
another car-there

  ramsay swung around and a laugh
broke from him at sight of another flivver
bearing down for the canon crowded with
men

  good it looks as though the law had
come to pinecate canon at last young
lady

  fifteen minutes afterward ramsay and
the grizzled sheriff from chuckwalla city
were accompanying miss gilman up the
canon toward the girls camp while below
them the deputies were getting the prisoners
loaded up and were bringing the five
horses to the cars all five of those horses
had been among the bunch recently stolen
from the other side of the range and two
of the deputies were preparing to ride on
to hourglass canon and take possession of
the herd there

  as the three came to the bend in the
canon ramsay halted and drew from his
pocket his brothers deed still in its torn
envelope

  sheriff heres evidence of a federal
charge to lay against sidewinder crowfoot
--mail-robbery i think it will serve to
give him a long time in the penitentiary
to think upon his sins suppose you look
it over while i say a word to miss gilman
will you

  the sheriff met his whimsical gaze
grinned and then strode on around the
bend with the evidence in his hand ram-
say turned to the girl

  what do you say about hourglass
canon young lady do you want to share
it with me

  well ill go and look at it but i wont
promise anything

  all right  thats fair enough and
youll call me pat

  her eyes surveyed him merrily

  not until-you get a shave she said
and then was gone running after the tall
figure of the sheriff a laugh floating back
to ramsay

  he followed smiling

  specialization

    this is an age of specialization in
  every field of activity so complex is
  civilization and so keen the competi-
  tion in the affairs of men that success
  and happiness are assured only to the
  man or woman who knows his craft-
  his art-his business

    if you would achieve success you
  must first be trained in the old days
  training was only acquired by years of
  arduous apprenticeship now in these
  days when education is so far reaching
  there are schools organized to teach
  in a comprehensive way every specific
  line of endeavor

  if you have a desire to
paint draw design clothes or
hats then an art school or a
school of costume design will
help you to put your talent
to profitable use

  if your inclination is to sing
or play the violin or piano
then a conservatory of music
is what you are looking for

  if you have a knack for
cooking or running a house a
school of domestic science or
housecraft will train you to
do it in the best possible way

                     you may feel the lure of
the stage or the movies there
are a dozen different schools
of dramatic art or stagecraft
that will give you the neces-
sary training

                        possibly your interests are
more practical you may want
to be a druggist or a photog-
rapher an electrician or an
accountant there is a school
for every one of these fields
of work

    all these vocational schools are ad-
  vertised in the red book mag-
  azine if you are undecided as to
  what school to choose write us and
  we will be glad to advise you

   schools can raise the salaries of other
   men they can raise yours if they can
