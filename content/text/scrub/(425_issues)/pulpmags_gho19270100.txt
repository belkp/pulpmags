nerves-ncyvcs- nervesi

 millions of people are today only half alive and dont know it
 they suffer from obscure illsworry about imaginary troubles
 find it hard to concentrate and easily fall a prey to disease
 that robs them of their vital powers-all as a result of con-
 tinuous neglect of their nerves bemarr macfadden in a
 wonderful new book shows how to recharge your under-
 nourished nerves and how to acquire glowing health and
 youthful vitality by following a few easy natural rules
 no medicines drugs or self-denials no exhausting
 exercises or disagreeable diets

do you worry and fuss over non-
essentials do you get ex-
cited easily do you blush
readily is your memory weak or
your eyesight failing are your
hands and feet cold  are you trou-
bled with constipation or other stom-
ach troubles are you pale is your
complexion blotched is your hair
falling have you occasional head-
aches and dizzy spells are you
troubled with insomnia and too
many dreams are you impatient
-emotional quick to show your
joy or sorrow

  these are only a few of the signs
that show unhealthy nerves and if
you neglect them you will slowly but
surely head for the same disastrous
condition that is now bringing misery
to thousands of people

why ruin your life

  many a promising career and
many a happy home has been
ruined by some impulsive word or
act many a social position has
been irretrievably lost by some
trifling indiscretion or error of judg-
ment-due entirely to unstable
nerves to think that one marriage
in every eleven ends in divorce
and to think that  of all the
misery of the unhappily married is
due to nothing more than irritated
nerves when a man loses his
temper and flares up in excitement
when a woman begins to nag fret
and worry when a child becomes un-
ruly or shy-its simply a case of
nerve exhaustion

  it is a pity that so very few people
really know how to keep their nerves
sound and healthful how much
misery could be avoided how much
unhappiness could be changed to joy
if the countless numbers of people
who now overlook the little signs of
nervous exhaustion could be made
to see the folly of their neglect

  it is now just as easy to have

sound healthy nerves as it is to have
clean strong teeth and vigorous mus-
cles without drugs or medicines-
without tedious exhausting exercises
or enforced hateful diets-without
doing anything that isnt pleasant
and delightful you can now recharge
your undernourished nerves and live
a full vibrant life that will help
you to achieve a glorious business
and social success

  based on his many years of ex-
perience as a physical culture expert
bernarr macfadden has picked out
and set down in writing certain
simple easy-to-follow rules that
have helped thousands of men and
women to regain their lost nervous
energy and to acquire glowing health
and youthful vitality he calls his
wonderful book

strengthening the nerves

  if you follow bernarr macfaddens
advice faithfully you will be over-
joyed at the results youll look
better and feel better than you have
in years you will have greater en-
durance a keener appetite and a
happier outlook on life than you
ever had before you will banish
headaches worries constipation
your complexion will become clearer
your eyesight stronger and you will
gradually build up a vigorous body
that will be able to resist nearly
every ailment that is at present
sapping the energy of thousands

fascinating style there is nothing
difficult to understand youll en-
joy every page because it shows you
the way to glowing health and vigor
the knowledge youll gain from
reading bernarr macfaddens book
will help you throughout your entire
life for it will build for you a solid
foundation for your future success
and happiness

  your health your strength your
success your happiness depends
upon the state of your nervous
system you cant be right and be

o	oe romantic careers of a sirl from

 martinique and a

and a orown

reole a uorsican

gy then monsieur tascher de la pagerie a successful 	g

 planter of far-off martinique took his daughter marie-josephc-rose	

       called josephine to paris her languid creole manner voluptuous beauty
 graceful litheness of figure elegance of manner quick intelligence voice that
 charmed and qualities of mind and heart fascinated the young aristocrat

 alexandre de beatiharnais what must have seemed to m de la pagerie a
 most satisfactory marriage took place he never could have guessed to
 what depths his daughter was to fall or what heights she would rise or
 that after a most romantic and stormy career she was to wear the crown
 of france that a bloody revolution
 was to throw at the feet of a poor
 young corsican lieutenant

    during the revolution her husband
 was guillotined and she imprisoned

 her life saved by a lucky chance
 and released the young widow car-
 ried away by the license of the times
 and the sensuality of her nature un-
 folding her wings like a butterfly
 became the gay leader of one of the
 gayest sets of the many giddy coteries
 in the luxurious and dissipated life that
 arose after the reign of terror

   the young corsican had now be-
 come a poor and rather obscure general
 whose energy industry military genius
 power of calm calculation and self
 control was to make him the ruler
 of europe and the most universally
 known name in all history he lost

 his self-control however when he met madame de beauharnais and fell madly in love with
 her rather awed by the elegance of her dress and station captivated by her voice and
 grace of manner dazzled by her beauty and overcome by charms that the dress of the period
 scarcely concealed his passion became almost a frenzy and he became her infatuated slave

    she at last consented to marry him on the wedding ring was engraved au destin

                         i like lo read about napoleon certainly the corsican was one of the most

 josephine charming fascinating sympa-
  thetic and lender of heart the world n

mpa- i

osephine and cyapoleon

 passionate lovers

  the piquant and lovely creole led the man of destiny
  a pretty dance but while she tormented her impecunious
  lover with her extravagances she always felt that he was
  in truth the man of destiny that she grew afterward to
  love him passionately and profoundly and that she was
  devotedly faithful to him barring one eatly misstep
  during his absence in egypt is known beyond a doubt
  at times the ever-present menanceof divorce bred fear
  of him but gratitude for the undreamed of grandeur to
  which he had raised her filled her heart to the end

their peculiar fascination

  josephine and napoleon-an emperor and an empress
  risen from the people-while living were the centre of
  interest of the world to-day though dead over a hun-
  dred years they still exercise over millions a peculiar
  fascination it is not merely their lofty stations as rulers
  of most of europe that creates this interest napoleon-
  whose name fills more pages in history than any other
  mortal-the great warriorwhose marvellous career ex-
  celled that of alexander the great and caesar has always
  compelled the admiration and the interest of mankind

the truth about them

  but it is as a human being that his greatest interest
  remains to-day in some eyes a god in others a monster
  the truth is that napoleon was neither but a man with
  mans weaknesses who nevertheless continued kind
  and liberal to josephine a ban-en wife who had con-
  sented to divorce and was even lenient and forgiving
  toward marie louise the unfaithful wife who deserted
  him in time of trouble out had borne him ason after the
  divorce he was still friendly toward j osephine and allowed
  her to retain the title of empress and showed her respect
  and regard it is the truth about this living palpitating
  woman her faults as well as her virtues that attracts us

the real woman revealed

  the real woman the woman charming fascinating
  sympathetic and tender of heart beyond all the women of
  her time is revealed to us in the celebrated memoirs of
  madame ducrcst in them she lives and breathes-not
  merely as a type of the eternal feminine but as a woman
  of her period lull of sensibility and also of bumor

private letters tell about napoleon

  no more intimate picture of napoleon and his entourage
  exists than that drawn in a series of private letters written
  from paris to a nobleman in london at the time when
  napoleon was emperor with these and the memoirs of
  madame ducrcst we are enabled to know josephine and
  napoleon as they were in the flesh and to know their
  hopes and fears their joys and sorrows

ghost stories

thrilling true adventures
of famous detectives

mystery is irresistible it fascinates it intrigues you
because the desire to understand-to know why and how
-is a fundamental human characteristic

that is why when all other reading material becomes
distasteful and utterly unable to hold your wandering
attention mystery stories never fail to rekindle jaded
interest-never fail to grip your attention in a current of
magnetic attraction

long ago you probably discovered among the most
famous stories in literature many tales which were woven
about mysterious seemingly unfathomable tangles in
human relationships

but even the best of these classic tales were woven of
fiction they had no basis in fact interesting as they
proved they were nonetheless written about imaginary
happenings-their plots were synthetic-their soundness
was open to argument the sympathetic human element
was lacking

     partial contents
 of the december issue of
 true detective mysteries

  on the trail of the crimson hand
  the mystery of mata haris love letters
  i had to break the wellington gam-
  bling ring
  the talking bullet
  the loot of the eastbound express
  the woman who loved too well
  theyre going to kill my son
  they tried to insure their loot
  the clue of the stolen thumbprint
  love mad a crime of the kentucky
  hills

  the alibi that failed

  flying diamonds

  the man who lived ten lives

told you by master detectives

   now at last you can read an almost endless selection of detective
 mystery tales that are true that combine all the fascination all
 the lure of fictional stories with the sure knowledge that the
 events unfolded in cameo clearness on the page before you have
 actually happened now you can read thrilling accounts of
 actual exploits of living detectivesy-absorbing first-hand state-
 ments of how tangled tfails of criminal operations have been
 solved	

   the gripping stories are written directly for you or outlined m
 all their essential facts by some of the most noted detective minds
 of the present day they are true detailed explanations of
 detective resourcefulness and skill which beggar description and
 they are collected and printed for your enjoyment each month in

dandruff-if it doesnt stop falling hair-

this offer stands

you are not satisfied with my treatment
i dont even ask you in what way my
treatment failed

  if you are not absolutely delighted

ment fails to do any one of the things i
say it will do-simply let me know and
i will send you by return mail a check
refunding every penny of your money
and remember you alone are the judge
of whether my treatment works or not

why this offer

  how am i able to make this amazing
offer the answer is simple my
system of hair growth is founded

covery i have found

      heres proof

  for  days find a new growth of hair coming

  head-mrs ii s port angeles wash

partly bald for  years

     t have been partly bald for the last 
   years and have used your treatment four
   weeks to date blit i can already see a new
   crop of hair coming in-j a k anderson
   ind

during many years of research and ex-
perience in the merke institute fifth
avenue new york that in most cases
of baldness the hair roots are not
dead they are merely dormant-
asleep

  it is an absolute waste of time-a
shameful waste of money-to try to
penetrate to these dormant roots with
ordinary oils massages and tonics
which merely treat the surface
skin you wouldnt expect to
make a tree grow by rubbing
growing fluid on the bark-
get at the roots and
that is just what my
scientific system
does it penetrates
below the sur-
face of the
scalp it
stimulates
the dor-
mant
roots

never scoff

at a ghost

by qeorge idilliam ipilder

       ow often have you heard people say ghosts nonsense no such thing
       who can believe that any but human beings of flesh and blood exist on
       this globe there is no such thing as a haunt-and certainly no such
       thing as vengeance after death this is a material world

   attend the case of wizard clip of west virginia

   long years ago history states in a little town in jefferson county west
virginia a man lay dying he was in the cabin of a neighbor adam livingston
death seemed inevitable and livingston did all in his power to relieve the physical
suffering of his guest

   came the dying mans request that livingston get a spiritual adviser a clergy-
man livingston refused

   the guest died and from the time of that death through many years that
followed a series of portentous events colored the life of adam livingston that
only ended when he himself-in terror and a nervous wreck-sought the aid of a
recognized minister of the gospel and received what amounted to divine ameliora-
tion

   shortly after the strangers death horses are said to have been heard circling
the livingston house the steady tread tread of their hoofs jarring the nerves of the
inhabitants dishes pitched from their shelves and were broken pieces of coal
sprang from the fire a barn burned down heads were cut from chickens-all with
no physical human explanation

   next came sounds of the grinding of shears as they clipped suits of clothes
hair from womens heads shoes curtains-all were clipped to shreds this gave
rise to the wizard clip as the name of the livingston ghost

   rumor declares that a woman a skeptic going to visit the livingstons had in
the pocket of her dress a silk cap she scoffed at the livingston haunt-and
when her cap was removed from her pocket the cap was in shreds plainly having
been clipped but no one ever saw the shears or the wielder of the cutting blades

   you never saw a ghost-you never touched a ghost-perhaps you never heard
a ghost but how can you say that they dont exist beware of scoffing be-
ware-lest your clothes fall away in shreds lest the haunt of horses tramping
hoofs wreck your peace beware-lest scoffing bring upon you shattered nerves
a restless spirit a craving for peace that can be satisfied nowhere


the specter of ihe

           iphen smith uas made deputy police commissioner
           he neuer dreamed he mould be throun in touch with

there are a few hoary-
haired retired policemen
who once pounded the
pavements of new yorks
chinatown and who havent
forgotten the ghost of tsing lai
low

  but if you encountered one of
these and asked him for the story hed only wink know-
ingly shrug-then walk away without replying

  as one of the leading actors in this thrilling drama per-
haps the weirdest that ever shook new yorks yellow
quarter- from the fan-tan rat holes behind the dingy shops
to the stinking opium dives in the catacombs beneath the
roadways and ramshackle tenements-i am able to tell the
story-all of it and it will be the first time the truth has
ever appeared in print

  i must go back to early december - and for the
purpose of this tale-for particular reasons-i shall be
john smith

  six months previous i had been appointed a deputy
police commissioner and assigned to direct the fight against
the distribution of contraband narcotics in the chinese
district this appointment came largely because of the fact
that i had held a government post in china for a few years
and thereafter was supposed to possess an intimate knowl-
edge of celestials and their habits

  my asiatic experience had taught me that the harder a
white man tries to pry into the secrets of the orient the
more he realizes they are beyond his ken but however
it didnt take me long to learn that opium shipped from
germany and turkey was being smuggled into chinatown
in such quantities that the price had dropped from  a
can to 

  of course we arrested and tried to pump many of the
known persistent smokers the worst of the white and yellow
driftwood but though we kept some of these in cells until
they were half mad for a drag at the dope none would
squeal also though we uncovered and closed up a few of
the joints we never located sufficient of them to do any
good and we couldnt get a line on how the stuff was
being smuggled in and who was distributing it

plnally i decided that the contraband was being
brought into the quarter in the early morning hours
when the streets were practically deserted and the uniformed
and plain-clothes men on the night shift would be least
watchful i made a surprise trip there around three oclock
one morning and caught the men of the detail huddled in
doorways beyond the sweep of the winter wind i read the
riot act its hard enough to catch a chinese crook with
everybody on the alert with the police half asleep-good
night i after that i made it my business to slip into china-
town early each morning the men were distinctly on their
jobs but all reported nothing doing

  tliis went on for several days then came sunday
december th it was two oclock in the morning in a
raging snow storm when i swung from the chatham square

     

l station i had all but reached
the upper west corner of the
quarter when a policeman whom
i recognized as clancy a veteran
of the section came stumbling
backward out of a tenement door-
way lunging out wildly with his
club

 what the - i began as he bumped into me he

turned with a jerk and his hand went up in salute i saw
the man was badly frightened for his eyes fairly bulged
and his jaws twitched as he tried to speak

  come on man be yourself and i shook him roughly
whats up

  god he gasped then shot a frightened glance over his
shoulder toward the entry where the door stood open

  i felt certain clancy wasnt doped or drunk he was
one of the old reliables of the force and anytlring which
had given him such a jolt must be decidedly unusual

  i just had the scare of my life chief he added shame-
facedly making an effort to recover his composure i
never saw a ghost before but if i didnt see one in there

just fore you came along ill be-

  what are you driving at

 isten chief im telling you on the square i was
slipping along here looking for an unlocked door sos i
could get in out of the storm for a few minutes i stepped
into the hall i had just removed my coat to shake off the
snow when i heard a sound and looked up there was
old tsing lai low-standing on the stairs you know
the fellow they call the svise one i nearly took a flop
just as i was raising my club to give him a crack he sud-
denly pointed up then-just disappeared into the air right

before my eyes and while the hall light was on him sos-

  and you lost your head eh  i watched his expression

closely youre certain-

  i know what youre thinking chief but im telling you
straight ive known old tsing for moren twenty years
and couldnt be mistaken but-well ill swear he didnt
go up stairs and you know he didnt pass you

  i was about convinced that for once clancy had yielded
to hard liquor in the hope of warming his blood and it had
gone to his head well stop guessing and learn the truth
i replied sharply tsings flat is on the third floor ive
been there often well go up there right now walk
quietly no good waking up the whole tenement and bring-
ing half a hundred chinks around us

  obviously clancy had seen something no man drunk
or sober could have so counterfeited the fear that he had
shown and he had not known of my presence when he
came stumbling from the tenement striking at nothing
but though his story was too fanciful for me to swallow
i wanted to make certain of tsings safety for i con-
sidered him a real friend after i had established that fact
i would try to ascertain the foundation for the cops hallu-
cination however as my identity still was unknown to
the riff-raff of the quarter and must remain so if i were

assigned to clean up trade in narcotics in chinatown
some unseen uorld before his case could be settled

                                   moan came
                                   from some-
                                   where in the
                                   darkness be-
                                   yond

i found the elec-
tric button and
pressed it instantly the inner
hallway sprang- into light
again we heard the fear-
some groan but fainter jerking clancy inside i closed

 to accomplish anything i cautioned him to say nothing

   as we rounded the head of the stairway and turhed toward
 the front i thought i caught a low groan as of some one
 in pain a gasp behind me indicated that clancy also had
 heard it was with taut muscles and heart pounding that i
 hastened forward and grasped the door handle to my
 surprise the door opened but for a moment we stood
 rooted in our tracks as another groan a sort of choking

i heard a sound
and looked up there
was old tsing lai
low-standing on
the stairs




ghost stories

the door with-
out sound and
snapped one of
the several locks
upon its inner
side next re-
volver in hand
and followed
closely by the
policeman i tip-
toed to the far
end where
heavy dragon-
bedecked silk
curtains hid the
roo m beyond

this was a large
room which i
knew tsing lai
low used as a
combination
study and living
quarters i was
glad to note a
slit of light
shining between
the drapes

  the next in-
stant i had flung
them aside and
crossed  the
threshold my
weapon ready
for action what
i saw all but
stunned me the
place instead of
being as i had
last seen it-an
orderly room
rich oriental
resplendent with
hangings and
tapestries inlaid
teakwood furni-
ture and an as-
sortment of cost-
ly ornaments
from the shops
of tokyos mas-
ter craftsmen-
was topsy-turvy and litter-
strewn drawers had been
pulled and tossed to the
floor curtains had been
rudely torn from the walls
chairs had been over-
turned innumerable pa-
pers showing chinese
characters upon their

pages were scattered everywhere i also noted the gleam
of coins gold and silver here and there upon the rugs

  only a large jeweled buddha on a gilded pedestal be-
tween the heavily screened front windows appeared to be
in its proper place

  but this chaos-obviously the work of vandals who had
wrecked the wise mans quarters in a hasty and far-reaching
search for something for which they had intruded-held me
only momentarily everything suggested that something far
more sinister had occurred then i recalled the groans
perhaps they had come from tsing

picking my way carefully so as not to disturb anything
i moved toward the doorway leading to the rooms running

 dr

                    parallel to the inner hallway as i
                    rounded the desk i stumbled over the
                    body of the man i sought lying upon
                    his back his wrinkled parchment-like
                    face contorted into a horrible grimace
                    the handle of a dagger protruding
                    from above his heart indicated how
                    he had met his end unquestionably
                    the patriarch had fought hard for his
                    life for his silken garments were in
                    ribbons and blood upon the knuckles
                    of both hands indicated lie had bat-
                    tered at least one of his assailants

                  iropping upon my knees i made
                  a hasty examination appar-
                  ently tsing had been dead but a
                  brief time for his body was still
                  warm the discovery made me
                  catch my breath for it was less
                  than half an hour before-plainly
                  about the time that the murderer
                  had struck-that clancy had seen
                  the old man upon the stairway
                  but-had he seen tsing i
                  recalled that he had said the
                  thing which frightened him
                  had been a ghost-that it
                  had disappeared into thin
                  air before his very eyes
                  what do you make
                  of it chief

                                        the cops query snap-
                                      ped me back to my duty
                                      of the moment i shook
                                      my head then bent
                                      again and examined the
                                      hilt of the dagger it
                                      was short of black jade
                                      into which scrolls of
                                      silver had been cun-
                                      ningly inserted and
                                      had a peculiarly twisted
                                      guard i recognized it
                                      instantly as an arm-
                                      dagger the kind i had
                                      seen carried by chinese

of caste in the orient it fitted into a sheath strapped about
the left arm near the elbow where it was hidden by a flowing
sleeve but could be reached instantly with the right hand
in case of emergencies

  to me the weapon established two things first tsing
had not been slain by a typical tong bravo such a killer
would have used either an axe or a large caliber revolver
for the tong murderer is a terrorist he uses the more
brutal weapons that all friends of the man slain may know
that the assassination was part of an organization feud
second the old man was killed by a chinese of one of the
better castes who had come to tsing with certain de-
marfds and had struck only when the other had refused
the specter ob the yellow quarter	

into new york about two years previous
and since then she had lived in the seclusion
 his home

  i plunged into the room beyond the sleeping quarters of

and attacked him the quality o the knife told me that

 would you want to get headquarters sir queried
clancy nodding toward a telephone instrument upon a
taboret as i arose

  not yet things have been breaking too fast for me to
think clearly in the excitement i forgot there should be
others here wait till i come back dont touch anything
in the room

 the others who shared the place with tsing lai low
were lee poy his aged servant and his adopted daughter
bow ming a beautiful chinese girl of perhaps sixteen
whose existence in the quarter i believed was known to no
other white man by some means tsing had smuggled her

the murdered man the electric lights were burning
though the coverings of the couch had been drawn back
for the night the orderly condition of the bed proved the
old man had not slept there and the fact that the couch
and the other contents of the room had not been touched
indicated that the intruders either had been frightened away
before completing their search for the mysterious something
-or had located it in the study

 swung aside the curtains which i knew concealed the
 three small but luxuriously furnished rooms that tsing
had turned over to bow ming the first two were lighted
and orderly then i came to the third the girls sleeping
chamber what i saw forced a sigh of mingled dread and
relief for though she was not there and murdered as i
had feared it was only too plain that she had been there
recently and had been removed by violence the bed cloth-
ing had been dragged to the floor the garments she had
discarded when disrobing lay scattered about an overturned
chair and-

then again came that tantalizing groan--but barely audi-
ble this time-from the rear where lee poy cooked and
slept i found him all but insensible trussed and bleeding
lying in a corner into which he had been thrown by his
assailants

it required some minutes after i had removed the
cords to bring him around sufficiently for him to recog-
nize me then i helped him to a chair gave him a
drink and waited until he was able to stand before
questioning him

his story was brief he had been sleeping when
aroused by a cry from the front
rushing there he had been
overpowered by three
natives who beat and
bound him then
rushed him to the
kitchen and
hurled him
into a corner

christmas ghost

the tinkle of a tiny bell shaken vigorously by a
scarlet-coated salvation army santa at the curb
echoed cheerily through the frosty air

i stepped into the
doorway of a little
shop whose lights peeping
from behind panes festooned
with greens and holly shone
out into the shabby thorough-
f are	

  for my numbed and- tired
limbs called for a moment or
two of rest rest beyond
the reaches of the steadily
falling snow which the wind
from the not-distant river
whipped into swirls before
tossing it into drifts along
the pavement rest to re-
cover a bit of energy to con-
tinue the gladsome task which
had kept me on the move
almost continuously since
early morning

  for it was christmas
eve and i had spent
the day distributing
gifts and money among
those of the great citys
needy whom i knew
personally

  as i wiped the snow
from my eyes and
dusted it from the fur
about my throat the
little bell again sent
forth its merry clatter

  i looked at the coun-
terfeit santa who 
stamped energetically
about his kettle to keep
up circulation in his
body but no hint of
his personal discomfort
could be noted in his
twinkling eyes or his mouth
twisted into a grin behind his ill-
fitting whiskers

  and as one or another of the
bundle laden crowd that trudged past
him tossed a coin into the snow covered
bottom of his kettle there seemed lo be
music in the tone of his never faimg

thank you merry christmas

  anxious to do my bit toward keeping
that particular pot boiling with a liberal contribution which
would go toward providing a bumper christmas dinner for
the citys derelicts on the morrow i opened my purse and
reached deep with eager fingers but i gasped a bit when
they drew forth but two coins a silver quarter and a nickel
surely there must be some mistake i thought there


by antoinette qregory
as related by
eduin a qoeuey

must be a bill or two hidden in some corner but though
i searched each pocket carefully not even a stray penny
rewarded me i had been even more liberal in my christmas
giving than i had supposed all that remained was thirty
cents

and even that shabby sum would have
to be divided for between the little
shop on the outskirts of a tenement-lined
stretch of murray hill in whose door-
way i had sought temporary shelter and
my home in the middle reaches of
riverside drive there lay several
miles of slippery streets i could not
walk the distance unfatigued i would
have hesitated to attempt the hike in
the face of the storm which made all
walking a real effort but already
about all in i knew i could not
make my way on foot the nickel
must go for a subway ride which
would carry me over a portion of my
journey

i dropped the smaller coin back into
my purse but as i held the other
ready to toss it into santas
yawning kettle a new
thought came to plague me
-one which drove all other
ideas temporarily from
my mind	

i had not yet visited
  the kelly tene-
  ment at the
  other end of
  murray hill
  the little
  three-room flat
  in which lived
  the widow
  bridget kelly
  who eked out
  just sufficient
  by day work
  to maintain a
  home and feed

and his features-	and clotheher-

somehow they appeared	self and her

familiar	five-year-old

son johnny what would johnny think if i missed him

  tears of vexation came to my eyes as i thought of them
for i was fond of bridget always hard working and un-
complaining and of all my young friends i loved johnny
johnny kellys christmas ghost



lillie johnny faces a lean christmas with no
toys no cheer hardly enouqh food then
from some unseen world comes-

most for he was a manly fellow ever planning and
looking forward to the day when he would be old enough

to go to work and help mother	

  i would have given material help long ago-to both of
them-but the proud bridget would not permit kind words
she welcomed charity she refused she would continue
to work and care for johnny until he had been to school

and then-

  but how could i have
forgotten them  they
had been foremost in my
mind when i left home
that morning for three
years i had done what i
could to make johnnys
christmas brighter-to
prove that santa claus re-
membered the children of
the tenements as well as
those of the avenues my
lapse of memory hurt

even though i had
been climbing stair-
ways since early
morning
though time

with mrs kelly and her little son i wished that by some
freak of chance they could be placed in possession of a
secret hoard of money i was certain that old house con-
tained money which had been hidden there by a former
owner that cache probably would be sufficient to place
the plucky widow and her boy beyond want for a long time
but i put aside my wish in order that i might consider
the more material need of the present
it was not too late even then to make
good for my lapse i glanced at my
watch only nine oclock bracing
myself for the long walk to the nearest
subway station i plunged out into the
storm my quarter plumped into the
snow at the bottom of santas
kettle as i reached the curb
and his cheery thank you
lady merry christmas i fol-
lowed me as i dodged across the
roadway through lumbering
swerving vehicles

                            it was not until i had edged
                          my way into a seat in the car
                          of a northbound train that i had
                          opportunity to think of
                          anything but the storm
                          which i had breasted of
                          how to keep from slipping
                          and keep the snow from
                          my eyes so that i could
                          note the streets i
                          traversed but
                          when i recovered
                          my wits i at
                          once remembered

come come
johnny youre
not afraid of

santa claua are
you

after time i had replenished my stock of toys and candy
though i had spent hours planning the distribution of gifts
with wan and work-worn mothers i should not have for-
gotten johnny

  then as many times since i first had become acquainted

johnny and the
necessity of pre-
venting bitter dis-
appointment coming to him on the morrow and
the thought seemed to give me new strength
and courage i was eager to carry on until i had fulfilled
the task to which i had set myself

  then probably because of old associations connected with
the tenement in which the kellys lived i recalled the first
christmas eve i could remember for it had been spent
in the self same structure

but tilings were so different then continued on page 
tnei id ho play ipith

        if jennings distraught nervous worried could have
      the spiritual advice given by his friend then he never
      committed his cjhaslly crime
      by jim kirkland	qold to mark mellen

 ave me kirkland save me for the love of god
said ed jennings when i had led him into my living
j room dont let it get me will you his deep
bass voice now was so husky i could barely dis-
tinguish words

sit down man whatever is the matter with you  take
the big leather chair-thats right wait a second and ill

pour you a drink take it straight or with a little-

  no-no dont leave me he cried taking hold of my
arm as i walked past him toward the cupboard in the dining
room i-i cant bear to be alone

  all right-as you wish have a cigar theyre right
at your elbow on the stand there match 

  ed jennings was my next door neighbor in deauville
where detached frame houses and wide spacious lawns and
hedges were the rule his house stood fifty feet or so from
mine seeing him on the commuters special of a morning
regularly and mowing his lawns of a saturday afternoon
or comfortably reading his paper on his front porch of a
sunday morning his wife at his side-i came to know a
normal contented business man of thirty-five or so happily
married entirely satisfied with the placid routine that made
up his little world

imagine my surprise then when he walked in on me like
this-looking like the wreck of the man i had grown
accustomed to see his white collar always spotless stood
up on one side as if he had started to take it off and got
only half-way finished with the job his hair was rumpled
and hung down over his eyes he was in his vest and shirt-
sleeves and baggy carpet slippers covered his feet

  while i held the lighted match to his cigar i did some
rapid thinking what could tliis mean i knew the man
only slightly and as a dignified steady fellow to see him
looking as he did and in this upset state of mind-why i
might have a lunatic on my hands plainly my best plan
was to humor him-at least until i could be on more
familiar ground

  now tell me i said making my voice as calm and even
as i could what is this thats pursuing you

  why its a frightful clawing monster-its nothing i
really dont know what it is

  instinctively i reached toward a pair of fire tongs that
rested close at hand beside my fireplace my impulse was
self-protection if indeed i had a madman to deal with
clawing monster-nothing     outwardly i smiled
and made myself appear cool and collected but before i
could frame a reply he went on

  ive wanted to come over and have a talk with you
kirkland but i just couldnt get myself to do it hang it
why should a man thrust his troubles onto another but
tonight i felt so unstrung-so unnerved i suddenly made up
my mind to come and here i am

  the man wasnt entirely irrational back of his wild
appearance and jumpy condition he retained all his faculties
there was a sort of sensitive consideration too for he knew
he was at liberty to drop in on a solitary bachelor like me
any time he pleased i saw now that my best move was to
wait and see what was in his mind then act accordingly

  kirkland i know you are interested in spiritualism he
said i have tried every known way to rid myself of a
bugbear that hounds me every minute im awake-which is
nearly every minute i live ive failed and now im
pinning my hopes in you

  i waited rapidly i went over in my mind what he had
said it is true i hold to the beliefs of the church-sect
if you like-called spiritualism yet i was at a loss to
know just how that fact could be of use to jennings i didnt
know what it was that troubled him i didnt know whether
or not i should propound the doctrines of my belief to him-
narrate for him some of the demonstrations i had seen i
seemed to be at a complete loss

  a present and vital need as i could plainly see was to
get the man in a calm frame of mind while he talked
his hand had kept going to his head his fingers combing
through his hair and instead of looking me in the face
as he spoke he would glance at me then stare at the book-
shelves across the room quickly find the corner of the
mantel behind me with a swift glance then show the whites
of his eyes in a nervous start as he focused his attention on
me again so i took a safe tack and trusted to developments
to guide me

  let me give you a viewpoint old man i said all life
is spirit not material understand all that really lives is
spirit when you once realize that you will find your affairs
shifting around into natural grooves nothing much can
worry you if you once understand that great fundamental
trudi even death will cease to terrify you for if all life
is spirit then life goes on after death come now buck up
these worries of yours cant amount to much all that
really is is spirit

t could see i had caught his attention for he kept his
eyes on me steadily until i had finished he didnt at-
tempt to speak not until he had given some thought to what
i had said then he turned to me a light of earnest zeal

 you mean
that a man will
putter along
with something
on his mind for
months or years
maybe without
settling his
worry but if
he once got it
into his head
that all life is
spirit then he
fvould stop wor-
tying  he
would keep his
mind on the
spiritual side ot
affairs and be
calm in his
mind is that it

  precisely i was
surprised that the man
had caught my mean-
ing so well

  he drifted into an-
other few moments of
thoughtful silence and
when he spoke again

i believed he had
taken himself in hand

at that moment i lit-
tle dreamed how far
wrong my judgment
of his condition was

no reason why i
should force my personal his-	

tory on you but im going to	hj

well able to help me my trou-
ble is all in my mind it began
about a year ago it was at the

time my wife began to ail and fret so unaccountably

  and you think there is a connection between the two

  undoubtedly i wake up at night and see her standing
at the foot of my bed she is crouching ready to spring at
me her face is distorted horribly so that she seems like
a creature who might have lived ten thousand years ago-
on raw flesh and in a cave i start up terrified when i see
her so-and when i get the courage to speak or leave im-

bed lo investigate she disappears each time for three
times after this apparition has appeared i have gone to my
wifes room and there i have found her peacefully asleep
on days following these visitations i inquire cautiously
how she has slept and she gives me no sign that she was
disturbed during the night

thats very strange i said when he paused i really
was held fascinated by what he was telling me here was

all life is spirit-i can see it
i feel it after death there is
no worry-all is happiness

asked my distracted neighbor

  no she wont go she says that slenderness and a thin
face are the things for her type of beauty thats the way
she puts it and when she has a temperamental outburst
she calls it upset nerves and lets it go at that no she
wont see a doctor and frankly im worried lest she waste
away why she has gone down from a hundred and thirty
to about a hundred in the last year if she keeps on shell

die	sure

  i was drawn to the man and wanted to help him but
i couldnt see what specific thing i could say or do right
then to relieve him of his worry i could make a quiet
investigation within the few days following right enough
but what he needed was a friendly continued on page 

a poltergeist or an astral body demonstration or maybe an
example of thought transference right next door to me 
i say that my wife began to ail and fret about a year
ago he went on nervously she did she is irritable with
me apparently for no reason she doesnt like the cut of
the clothes i wear she says they should be less conserva-
tive more showy if i go out of an evening i tell her ill
be home at eleven i go nowhere without her except to
the civil club in
town for a game of
cards but if i come
home at eleven-fif-
teen even at a quar-
ter to eleven she
upbraids me for not
keeping my word to
the minute she tells
me out of a clear
sky i hate you i
dont know why i
ever married

well enough it seemed to me there might be some natural
reason why his wife was tired of him and wanted to be rid
of him but i couldnt ask him that and from what i
knew from observing the man jennings was an ideal
husband he went regularly to his work and made a fair
income in the export business i say fair for he owned a
house that couldnt be bought under twelve thousand always
dressed well and dealt with the best provision stores in

town he rarely went out
without his wife as i knew

have you seen a doctor
about mrs jennings i

you

and ten minutes later she is
putting her arms around my
neck and saying how sorry
she is to have made such an outburst then each time
she confesses to me like a child that she spoke as she

did	because she was in the grip of something-forced to
fly into a tantrum because something compelled her to
this was a serious matter but i said nothing to jennings
and nodded for him to continue

  and she is losing weight kirkland she is wasting
away and my nightmares go right on tonight i saw her
btanding at the door she pointed her finger at me and
said get away from here i never want to see you
again and when i went into the house i found her up-
stairs reading her maid told me she hadnt left her room
since lunch-time and it was that experience which weighed
on me until i came over here to talk to you tonight

  i was greatly interested needless to say i wanted to pry
into jennings affairs but i dare not i didnt know the man

ghost stories

   fearful responsibility just what do you mean
   taking charge of me from singapore to mirabalu

   the doctor relinquished his spoon and sat up

   i shall be delighted of course

   then thats settled what an idiot barry was not to tell
 me you were coming by this boat it would have saved such
 a lot of trouble

   barry didnt know i was due back a month ago but
managed to get my leave extended he surveyed her doubt-
fully i dont know that youre going to be altogether
satisfied with this arrangement i have no small talk and
my dancing is execrable

   you can tell me all about mirabalu suggested bianca
 hopefully

 in

 m

     about half-a-dozen sentences mirabalu is a wilder-
 ness populated by half-baked niggers and chinese coolies
 with about seven white men to look after them theres
 not another white woman for fifteen miles

   the girl laughed

   what a charming description if its really as
 bad as you try to make out why does anybody live
 there at all  

   that is a question which invariably crops up at
 about the fourth whisky the queer thing is that
 nobodys ever been able to answer it whenever a
 chap goes on leave he takes a fond and final farewell
 of his friends murmurs something vague about in-
 fluence and a comfortable job at home-and drifts
 back to the same old area as soon as ever his time
 is up

 bianca frowned	v

   then it cant be such a desperately bad place
after all she declared would you like to live
in england

   the doctor shuddered

   not on your life dyou know

 miss seldon i believe there were only
 nine days in the entire seven months
 when it didnt rain

 there you are cried
 bianca triumphantly

you men are all the
same you drink
more than is
good for you
develop liver
trouble and dis-
tort your outlook
on life really
and truly i ex-
pect mirahata
is a delightful

spot with glorious views and any amount of amusement
to he had if one only takes the trouble to look for it
langley smiled

   youll find out soon enough

    suppose i shall anyhow ive fully made up my mind
to enjoy myself

   youll be bitten to death said the doctor

   i dont care barry says you get over that

   youll be eternally pestered by a mob of disorderly young
 ruffians each with a proposal of marriage in the back of
 his mind

    i shall like that

   and youll be very unwise if you accept any of em
because your brothers bungalow is the very best in the
neighborhood the only one in fact with glass windows
lie chuckled to himself and moved to one side to allow the
irpward to take his plate youll like mirabalu the life
the views everything presently youll be bored to ex-
tinct ion -and then youll like it so much that you wont
want tn leave it at all mirabalus an acquired taste hut

once acquired it sticks to you like a leech until--

 i see said bianca thoughtfully but you didnt want
 to let me down too lightly at first i suppose thats the line
 you take in your profession you swoop down upon your
 unfortunate patient send him to bed terrify him with an
 endless list of probable complications until the poor wretch
 feels so utterly grateful to you for saving him from such
 terrors that he cheerfully sends an enormous cheque by
 return mail

 the pursers steward entering suddenly stared around
 the saloon until his eye fell upon langley he came across
 to the table

 excuse me sir but dr murphy sends his compliments
 and would like to see you in the cabin

 the doctor glanced up sharply

oh-whats the trouble

 i dont know exactly sir i think hes got his hands
 pretty full

 wants help eh

 thats my opinion sir

 bianca who had been trying to see out of a port-hole
 touched langleys arm

 i believe weve stopped she declared

 tleen stopped this half-hour miss said the steward

  our wireless carried away in the storm last night and
 we havent been able to pick up calls theyve just brought
 aboard a fellow who was tied to some boards the chief
 steward thinks hes japanese possibly washed overboard
 from the ship we passed yesterday afternoon he was fully
 dressed with a small box strapped to his waist i saw him
 when they got him up
the black spider



  is he still alive interposed the doctor

  i believe so sir but hes in a bad way must have been
in the water for hours

  very well ill come along now youll excuse me
miss seldon wont you

  why of course isnt there some way in which i could
help

  langley shook his head

  there are plenty of stewardesses he reminded her
besides you may have to look
after your friend

  no said bianca they
wont let me do send for
me if youre short-handed

  were short-handed right
enough put in the steward

all the staff that arent sick
themselves are up to their eyes
in it theres hardly a bit of
china left in the kitchens-and
how were going to serve din-
ner tonight i dont know

  well be in colombo to-
morrow said the doctor
grimly and nobodys likely to
want much dinner before then lets see
-which way do we go

as he made his way down the corridor
 at the stewards heels it occurred to
him that bianca seldon was going to be
something in the nature of a disturbing in-
fluence in mirabalu for one thing she
displayed an enormous amount of character
for a girl of her age and for another she
was a great deal too good-looking for all
his morbid description of the place where
he lived and worked he knew mirabalu
as a colony that was essentially masculine-
masculine in its outlook its amusements
and its excesses

  there was not a more amiable group
of men to be found anywhere and why
barry seldon had been such an un-
mitigated ass as to bring his sister out
there langley didnt know he wasnt
in the least sorry for bianca for shr
could look after herself and was bound
in any case to have a tolerably good
time-but he was mortally sorry for mirabalu for
some reason or other he was feeling depressed that
morning and was prone to regard bianca in mira-
balu and a bottle of fire-water in a camp of indians
as one and the same thing they had been perfectly all
right up to now but-when she arrived-r-

  he found the ships doctor in his shirt-sleeves he
was a fat broad-featured man with a belfast accent and
dark lines under his eyes which betrayed that he had been
up all night

  i hate to trouble you again doctor- he began but

langley cut him short

  trouble be damned murphy if you had had the nerve
to attempt to carry on without me i should have been
mortally offended what do you want me to do

  have you had breakfast 

  ive had enough to carry me along thanks i dont
mind betting you havent had a bite yourself

  right-but im going to now i wish youd take that
poor devil of a jap off my hands for a bit the steward
here will show you where he is i tell you doctor i never
want another night like this ive had eight more fresh
cases through my hands since you turned inand i dont
think one of em will live

 did dr murphy put you here langley asked

 yes sir

 the man moved aside so as to allow langley to come
 close to the berth

 how is he

 pretty queer sir hes in a high fever now and keeps
 talking first in japanese and then in english

 the doctor bent down

 itd be a pity to let him slip through our fingers-after
 all lies gone through he glanced at a chart fixed to the
 wall by a couple of pins youve been up all night too
 i suppose

 yes sir

 anybody about who can relieve you

 no sir dr murphy told me id have to hang on or
 a bit longer	continued on pane 

 langley dropped a hand lightly on murphy boulder
 get some food into you and try and close your eye
 for a spell

 a patch of green water obscured the port-hole and re-
 ceded again revealing a stretch of blue sky

 were getting into clear weather again said murphy
 thats something to be thankful for well cheerio i
 ill be getting along to see my man

 he found his patient in a spare second-class cabin a
 man in a white coat rose as he came in

by allan qordon

octor i said-and i must have been crazy
to talk like that to the man if you dont save
her ill get you im not fooling doctor you
can hide where you please but it wont do you
any good ill find you ill get you youd
better save her doctor

  i suppose doctors become accustomed to such grief-crazed
lunatics as i -as then the name of this one has escaped
me he was a large calm man slow of speech and with a
trick of smiling quietly behind his thoughtful frown i
had told the people at the hospital to find the best surgeon
in the city regardless of the cost and this was the chap
they had routed out of bed at two in the morning he put
a broad hand on my shoulder peered intently into my face
for a moment then backed me into a comfortable arm chair
as easily as i could have handled a child

  sit there he commanded me without a trace of resent-
ment in his voice youve been through a good deal to-
night i know what it means he paused and his deep
tones sank to a whisper i lost my own daughter last year
if there is any hope at all your agitation will lessen it
control yourself man look at that girl there dont
you think she feels it too yet there hasnt been a word
out of her

  i glanced about the room as he released me with some-
thing more of sanity in my mind than had been there for
the last hour just the three of us were in the room
beside the doctor and the nurse sally on the bed was
like wax and i could not see that she breathed norma
her twin sitting stiffly on a chair at the farther srde seemed
as still as her dying sister-as still and nearly as pale
she gazed steadfastly at the face on the pillows and the
resemblance between them was so complete so perfect even
to the last detail of delicately chiseled nose and sweet sensi-
tive mouth that she might have been looking into a mirror
and there was i their father and also their manager

 you have heard of the gordon twins perhaps you
have seen them they were twenty-two no more when this
happened yet they had danced their way around the world
most of the european courts and many oriental throne
rooms had applauded them could you come to my home
some day i could show you six books full of clippings-
newspaper and magazine notices write-ups in theatrical
journals-no harsh words but only praise praise praise
and they merited it all i their father should know
please forgive an old mans vanity in speaking of this

 was their teacher before they acquired such skill that
i could also be their manager did they learn first to
walk or to dance i cant remember they were with me
on the stage when they were four and to me it was as if
the spirit of their mother who died in giving them birth
had been dancing they were her image and the image
of each other she too was a dancer i have thought at
times that her soul passed to them when she died so that
they were bound to each other by a stronger tie than other
twins are but you shall judge for yourself

narrated by j paul suter

  of the last hurrying motor ride between cities through
the darkness i need not speak save to tell its end a sharp
turn of the road hidden by the blackness of the heavy
night until we were fairly upon it-a missing signal of
warning-to the left a culvert-to the right the road and
safety our speeding chauffeur swerved too late and paid
for the error instantly writh his life norma and i were
miraculously uninjured not even rendered unconscious by
the shock but sally  when the distinguished surgeon
had examined her his verdict was short and terrible

  to operate now would kill her if she gains a little
strength then i will operate

  but will she live doctor-will she live i demanded
fiercely

  do you believe in god was his reply and when i

nodded-then pray

  that was when i threatened him frantically but it was
only some shallow surface layer of me which uttered the
threats deep in my heart i knew that this surgeon as
eminent in his profession as my twins were in theirs would
not surrender while life remained but i had seen enough
of hospitals to know something else and i think it was
this knowledge which made me desperate

u ere were two of us in the little room who need not
l have been admitted no one really was needed there ex-
cept the doctor had there been any hope norma and i would
have waited in the hall the fact that we were there un-
challenged by the surgeon proved that death too stood
by-death who withheld his hand through the few minutes
during which we hoped and prayed  then struck

  only a second or two before the end consciousness
returned to sally and she looked not at me nor at the
vigilant hovering doctor but into her sisters eyes i saw
them meet-those two pairs of blue eyes the glance of
understanding which passed between them was so definite
so palpable that it seemed almost a material thing

  what did she say to you norma i demanded almost
at the instant that the surgeon bowed his head

  my other daughter-the only child i had left now-looked
at me but did not answer it was the doctor instead who
spoke to the nurse

  have them arrange for connecting rooms at a hotel
he directed a taxi too he hesitated and glanced
inquiringly at me or if you prefer you can both have
beds here the accident has left you both uninjured but

the shock-

  before i could decide norma took the thing out of my
hands speaking for the first time since the accident

  we will go to the hotel she said quietly but in a voice
from which all color all intonation had fled then she
walked slowly from the room with no backward glance i
following mechanically for the time her will had assumed
dominance i was dumb unable to think

  i climbed into the taxi beside her i had no word for
anyone-none even for my old friend bertolli manager of
the theatre in which we were to have danced the next night


the woman with two souls	

surely death does not check the qrowth of a
soul so beautiful as salhj qordonsand ycf---

who awaited us with bowed head at the hotel bertolli had
arranged for the accommodations no detail remained
undone i looked into his dark eyes filled with tears his
kindly rugged face and looked away again but norma
went to him and said something rapidly and earnestly

  bertolli started violently i could catch neither his words
nor hers but i thought-
as far as thought was pos-
sible for me - that he
seemed incredulous almost
frightened norma was
demanding something he
was protesting she had
her way however for i
saw him nod and shrug
his shoulders then walk
rapidly from the hotel

  when she returned to me her deli-
cate face was as set and devoid of
expression as that of a marble statue

she followed the deeply concerned
clerk who himself showed us to our rooms
and  followed her

  so much had happened to me in those last
few hours cutting my very soul to
that i no longer had the power
deeply i expected to lie awake but it was
not so i had
hardly said
goodnight to
norma and stag-
gered back into
my own room
leaving the door
of her room

  suddenly i was forced back from oblivion someone
had spoken the voice fell on my ear like the tinkle of a
bell soft and musical yet so commanding that even my
deep sleep was shattered i sat up the lights were still
on as i had left them norma stood beside my bed

  she was dressed in the black velvet suit of a page boy

             the costume well our act had always begun
             girls clad as pages and their first dance in
             the soft closely fitting velvet was the key-
             note for all that followed some of their
             other dances were more difficult or more
             startling but none exceeded that
             first one in grace for convenience
             they had always left our hotel clad

                                           but will
                                           the jive
                                           doctor -
                                           will ahe
                                           live i
                                           demand-
                                           ed fiercely

ajar when complete and utter weariness took possession of
my frame the bed was soft and inviting i flung myself
upon it without having undressed and was soon asleep

  but before sleep engulfed me i thought of norma as
she had kissed me goodnight-her beautiful face still cold
and stiff like marble her voice hardly louder than silence
itself she was numb too i remember being thankful for
that and wondering vaguely what terrible pangs would
come when feeling returned to us

  one other thing i wondered about what message was
it that had passed between norma and her sister-at the
last it was this thought that hovered insistently before
my mind just before i sank into unconsciousness

jn their page cos-
tumes covered by long cloaks though all the other clothes
for the act were laid out for them with the theater properties

are you ready father  she said quietly

for what i demanded in bewilderment

for the act im afraid were a little late isnt it lucky
that bertollis theater is only a few steps from the hotel
hes going to have things all ready for us father i spoke
to him and he promised ours is the only act to-night you
know

i stared at her in utter dismay so this was how feeling
had returned she thought-oh my god she thought the
two of them were to dance together as usual what could


ghost stories

i do should i remind her of the truth or should i humor
her yet how could i humor her perhaps if i took her
to the theatre and danced with her myself   

  you talked with bertolli- i began feeling blindly

for a way out and to my amazement she laughed-her old
tinkling laugh

llou know i did father-you saw us mr bertolli prom-
ised to be there himself oh i believe i forgot to tell
you i forgot to tell my poor old padre so he went to
sleep while i was changing my clothes she patted my
shoulder then threw both arms around my neck and kissed
me im sorry father-poor tired father but youll
take me over to the theatre wont you and watch me
through the act 

  stiffly i led the way to the door it was about four
oclock in the morning the hotel attaches who saw us
pass down the stairs to the lower hall and thence to the
street must have eyed us with wonder

  as for myself i saw only the slender girl in the long
cloak walking silently by my side somewhere i had
learned that when the mind has reached the limit of endur-
ance-when it totters on the brink with black insanity
ahead-all that it does must be accepted as a matter of
course if the reason is to lie saved though i was not able
to think clearly that night this idea must have possessed
me for i took her through the deserted streets to the theater
that night quite as i might have done at any other time

  bertollis theater like its proprietor was one of my
oldest friends its associations reached far back into my
own dancing days it was bertolli whose strong quiet
sympathy never intrusive but always to be relied on had
helped me
through the time
of bereavement
when my little
girls were born
-at the cost of
their mothers
life as chil-
dren they had
danced upon his

not cast our first bitter moments among strangers bertolli
was my friend and a friend of wonderful insight since
my girl had spoken to him of this strange freak of her
mind i felt he would understand he would help me save
her reason

  i was not surprised when the old man met us at the
stage entrance he had been waiting

  you still wish to dance cara mia he asked norma
softly then you will find all as it should be the stage
is set in your dressing room ate the costumes as usual at
other theaters you did your own unpacking maybe but
bertolli always arranged everything-you remember and
you my old friend he said kissing me on the cheek after
the italian fashion -she will need your help in putting
on the costumes i will sit in the audience to-night i am
the audience

  i caught his meaning when he referred to normas need-
ing my help the girls had helped each other into their
more elaborate costumes that saved time for both i fol-
lowed norma down the dimly lighted passage-way to the
dressing room but she stopped me at the door her blue
eyes wide and inscrutable like those of a sleep walker
looked into mine and she smiled

  i shant need your help father sit with mr bertolli

rt-hat night she was in command i could do nothing
but obey my old friend just behind threw an arm
affectionately over my shoulder

a rehearsal in a darkened house he said making an
effort to laugh it will be like that we shall sit quite
near the front i think that will be better if she sees with
her mind a house full of people clapping stamping with
their feet-bravo-you and i we shall not
spoil the picture come

              as we crossed the stage and descended by
            the little flight of steps at the side i glanced
            about bertolli had done his part indeed the
            stage was set for our act just as he had set
            it many times before deep red curtains hung
            in the background undulating even now with

                                   stage and his shrewd eye
                                   had detected faults for
                                   me to correct before

they grew into habits

  many times since the old theater had welcomed their
tripping feet and had echoed back the applause of forgotten
audiences though fate had meted tragedy to us she had

i cried out and tried to
rise but bertollis iron
hand held me down

                                 the ripple of wind that
                                 sighed through the empty
                                 theater in my day i
                                 had used black hangings
                                 but years before norma
                                 and sally had suggested red they were right there was
                                 more of mystery in the warm red shadows

  when they stepped from the large frame-like a picture
frame-in which they were discovered when the curtain
rose a quiver always went through the audience it was
caused partly by their grace but also i think-though the
very people through whom the thrill was passing would not
the woman with two souls



have guessed that-by black velvet merging into red softly
inexplicably yet always to be distinguished by the eye-so
carefully chosen was the shade of red

the frame was there now shielded by curtains across its
front which could be drawn

 body arched forward one arm outstretched she was
 smiling and as the significance of that smile sank into my
 dazed mind i too sobbed for it was thus she had always
 been posed at the begin-

 aside with the pressure of a
 spring by the dancers with-
 i choked at sight of it
 something of the spell
 which had held me in its
 grip since we left the hos-
 pital was dissipated and i
 might have broken down
 entirely had not bertolli
 seized my arm with an im-
 perative come

   mechanically i went with
 him across the orchestra
 pit thence into the aisle

 he was careful not to re-
 lease me again i saw him
 glance sharply into my face
 once or twice as if to read
 my thoughts when we
 were seated there came a
 silence before he spoke

   old friend her mind is at
 stake he whispered grimly do
 not ask how i know i cannot tell
 you i see beneath the surface
 in things like this i have vision
 which others have not it is her
 mind i tell you-her mind if
 this shock is great for you-a
 strong man-think what it means
 to her to-night i hope by do-
 ing just as she says-by humoring
 her-we shall keep her sane

   i looked at him dumbly often
 when with him i had felt the
 truth about himself which he now

my little girl was supported by a
ghost figure-the figure of sally

tense

put into words certain things hidden to other men were
revealed to him but i have always been practical even
now a commonplace objection came to me and i told him
of it the act was arranged for two dancers throughout
it was a poetry of give and take in which the actors at once
opposed and helped each other i could not see how even
norma could go through it alone but bertolli shook his
head and in the dim light his seamed face softened in a
comforting smile

  have no fear for that my friend this that she does
to-night is not an exhibition of your art if she satisfies
herself with her dancing that suffices she will be
saved

a soft quiver passed along the curtains which hid the
 little stage within the frame i felt that norma had
entered i started and leaned forward bertollis firm hand
gripped my knee for an instant steady he whispered-
and the curtains parted

  dio into his heavy voice choked with a kind of a sob
but i was not watching him norma stood within the frame
rather i should say she hovered within it clad in her velvet
page costume poised so lightly upon her toes that she hardly
seemed to touch the miniature stage beneath her lithe

ning of the act but her hand now lightly proffered into
vacancy had then grasped another hand and she had smiled
into the up-tilted face of her sister who had knelt gracefully
on one knee and returned her gaze

   she is going to do the double dance i exclaimed in
 an amazed whisper

  dio mio merciful god answered bertolli crossing
himself

rt-he dance began- she tripped lightly from the frame

  to the stage of the theater and bowed-a long sweeping
 bow directed toward vacancy in that first dance the girls

 	had touched only their finger tips approaching each other
 and retreating gliding one about the other as lightly as
 thistle down held together by but one bond-the steadfast
 gaze of their blue eyes normas eyes were steadfast now
 they did not waver from the place where her sister would
 have been they smiled at nothingness while she pirouetted
 and bowed her fingers touched nothingness with as much
 certainty it seemed as they had ever met the tips of fingers
 they should never meet again

  at the finish of the dance she opened both arms wide
with a gesture of invitation that gesture had been the
signal for sallys retreat to the continued on page

 the

 the most persistent
      spiritualism is the
      haunted cameras

           can we photograph ghosts

           in spite of the repeated and au-
 thoritative efforts to show up the whole
 business as a sham and a fraud-which most
 of it certainly is-the thing will not down

 as fast as one medium is caught at a new
 trick another scientist of indisputable re-
 spectability comes forward with evidence
 which cannot be blown away with the breath
 of contempt

   on the face of it the thing seems to be
 absurd how can any sensible human being
 in his right mind come to believe that phan-
 toms of the dead invisible to the naked eye
 can become visible present and evident on a
 photographic plate by what process of
 reasoning can men and women otherwise
 normal in all their ways of thinking accept
 such a fantastic idea that is the natural
 reaction of anyone who hears about spirit
 photography for the first time

   yet a little examination into the subject
 will make the matter clearer to him he
 may be a greater skeptic than ever but he
 will certainly be puzzled and amazed

   for the wonders of spirit photography are
 manifest and manifold nor can they be easily
 dismissed

   i remember very clearly my introduction
 to the whole subject it was through the
 pages of hours with the ghosts a very
 fine book in its period written by my friend

 doctor henry ridgely evans through his
 gentle and cynical style i first learned the
 theory of spirit pictures and their makers-
 the mediums of the camera

   it seemed that not everyone could take
 spirit photographs one had to be psychic

 in the vulgate one must be a medium if i
 used the same camera the same plates the
 same studio the same everything-nothing
 would appear there would be no ghosts on
 the negative that was because i was not a psychic but
 all that was necessary was the presence of the medium in
 the room his hand must press the little rubber bulb and
 lo-a miracle ghosts would throng into the room and
 some of them would impinge their likeness on the picture

   that was the theory my friend doctor evans went
 on to explain certain facts he revealed the methods of
 double exposure not so generally known when his book was
 

 by which prepared plates could be
 devices employed by tricksters and
 swindlers to dupe the victims

   that was perhaps a quarter of a
 century ago since that time there
 have appeared innumerable exposes
 of spirit photography the discus-
 sion has raged in scientific and pop-
 ular journals and books have been
 written for and against their gen-
 uineness the whole world knows
 of the storm of controversy that
 raged around the head of sir arthur
 conan doyle when he declared that

   some pictures are reproduced in connection with this
 article for your especial benefit these same pictures have
 been the subject of considerable controversy in the mean-
 time a society has been formed in england for the sole
 purpose of studying spirit pictures

   there are famous camera mediums in england in various

do you belieue that spirits from some unseen world

you read --

parts of the united states even in far-away australia
perhaps the most celebrated is hope of england who
made some of the
ghost pictures of sir
arthur conan doyle
that constitute strik-
ing exhibits in
doyles collection

  people often ask me
what i think of spirit
pictures in my
twenty-five years
as an investiga-
tor of spirit
phenomena i
have of course
made many ex-
aminations into
the subject be-
fore stating an
opinion i should
like to narrate

 two remarka-
 ble photo-
 graphs taken
 by camera
 mediums
 note the spirit
 faces showing
 dimly in the
 background

one or two experiences that i have had with camera mediums
and their methods and then state a conclusion at which i
have arrived

  in advance however let me say that i consider intolerant
incredulity a fault far graver than stupid credulity

  my first famous experience with spirit photography
created a national even an international furore and was a
deliberate hoax undertaken to prove that even under the

most rigid test conditions one could accomplish spirit pic
tures by fraud

              at that time-in the summer of -i
            believed that every spirit photograph ever
            exhibited was a conscious or an unintentional
            fraud i had arrived at this conclusion after
            years of experimentation with one camera
            medium after another and detecting them all
            in deliberate trickery

           there had been formed in new york
        that summer what was known as the new
       york committee for psychic science and
       philosophy an ambitious title for a serious
       little group one evening we all assembled
       at the home of doctor edwin f bowers on
       west end avenue in manhattan practically
       every one present had devoted more or less
       time in the past to investigating spiritualism-
       spirit raps mysterious messages spelled out
       by the rockings of a table slate writings trances
       and the materialization of ghostly forms the
       purpose of the organization was merely to con-
       tinue such investigations under a loose form of
       unity and coherence within half an hour after
       the first meeting was called the lights were out
       and the little group of men and women were
       gathered around the table with their hands prone
       waiting for a demonstration

           it came

           the table gave a leap into the air as if it were
alive it rocked back and forth tilted turned and
ambled from one room into another instantly
questions were put to it to which replies were
rendered in loud and sonorous knocks these
knocks seemed to come from the very heart of the
table

  is there a spirit in this table was the first
question

          it appeared that there was and the presence
        identified itself as the soul of hyslop the great
        pioneer of psychic research in the united states
        of america but no one was very cordial to the
        professor for he didnt remember his own birth-
        day or his own middle name the experiment was
        dropped in discouragement and the group applied
        itself to a serious discussion for the remainder
        of the evening

  this discussion turned on spirit photography i had just
read where sir arthur conan doyle had laid down the
rules of evidence for psychic photography and i was telling
the others about it

  sir arthur laid down the following rules by which to
judge the authenticity of a spirit photograph

  -the usual control of plates camera and photo-
grapher which means that the continued on page 

                                                      
out ofa

when ralph durham ran away to sea
came back home his father was
the durham wealth be only the

y heart was pounding
violently ait the clang
of the doorbell echoed

through the big silent house  began to wish
fervently that i hadnt come in spite of niyself
the prodigal son feeling persisted

  the old home seemed to have gone to seed i thought in
these fifteen years i had been away the yard was weed
grown the paint was peeling from the house and the porch
furniture was shabby perhaps father had sold it and had
moved somewhere else why the devil didnt someone
answer the bell  i tugged at it again

  followed another long wait then there came the faint
sound of pattering feet down the carpetless hall and i heard
the bolt being pushed back the door was thrown open
and a small bright-eyed elf of a woman stood before me

  im sorry to keep you waiting she began at once in a
thin high-pitched voice but you see i wasnt dressed fit

to answer the door-bell-- a childlike helpless sort of

smile finished the sentence more eloquently than words

  oh thats all right i found myself responding to the
faint charm of her in spite of my earlier annoyance such
a futile sort of little old lady she seemed one couldnt help
liking her i was looking for major durham who used
to own this house i told her

 oh-major durham hes dead she nodded her
head once or twice as though to give emphasis to the flat
statement his wlddy rented the house to me and moved
to tother end of town down by the railroad tracks

  father dead and that woman still alive-and living
down by the railroad tracks but i might have expected
something of that sort lots of things can happen in
fifteen years

d better stick around awhile and do a little investigating

	i thought i had no desire to see my step-mother the
cause of my youthful unhappiness-the woman who had
driven me away from home still  must sift this thing
to the bottom then i had a bright idea why not spend
a few days in town incognito i was quite sure no one
would recognize me i had met half a dozen old-timers on
my way from the station and not one of them had cast me
a glance of recognition

  was you a particular friend of his

   became suddenly aware that the little old ladys bright
eyes had been regarding me steadily with both interest and
compassion and i made an effort to pull myselt together

  yes i said slowly -in a sort of a way fact is i
hoped to do a little business with him

  cant you see his widdy couldnt you do the business
with her instead i can give you her address

  no-no thanks she wouldnt do at all i began to
think fast how about that piece of land up by the lake
that major durham used to own was that sold

  yes he sold that a couple of years before he died but
i might be able to put you in touch with the man who bought
it her face was all alight now and i could almost hear
the thoughts formulating behind that radiance she would
arrange it for us both and perhaps there would be something

in it for her foxy little old girl i
well perhaps i might be in-
terested- i smiled at her re-
assuringly meanwhile id like to find a place to stay for
a few days do you know anyone in town who utkes in
boarders and might be able to put me up

  a beatific smile greeted these words and her excitement
 simply refused to be suppressed

  yes indeed i know someone you might stay here with

me ypu know im supposed to be-well you sec--

she paused uncertainly i keep boarders there arent
any staying here right now of course but then things
havent been as busy as they are sometimes

  you mean that you could put me up here

   yes i

  why that would be just fine are you sure it wont
inconvenience you-

mot at all come right ibis way she made a futile
 grab at my bags but i forestalled her and with a face
wreathed in smiles she lead the way into the house and
upstairs

  i glanced hurriedly about as i followed her and noted
 with a pang the decay and ruin that had come upon the
 home of my childhood all that was fine all that was of any
 value seemed to have disappeared and what remained of the
 furnishings and fixtures were shabby and worn and dingy

  we had reached the upper floor now and suddenly the
 little woman-miss southwick she told me was her name
 -stopped before a door it was the door of my old room

   found my heart pounding violently with excitement
was it intuition or just strange fate that had prompted
her to give me this of all the rooms in the house she
couldnt know me for i had never set eyes on her before
in my life

  at sight of the old room memories of a thousand hours
 spent there rushed back at me like myriad ghosts strange
 too that the place was practically as i had left it save that
 some of the books and little personal belongings were missing

  will this be all right mister-

  evans is the name-george evans

  well mr evans if this isnt all right i can show you
 some of the other rooms but this one is ready and the
 others would have to be made up

 assured her that this was perfectly satisfactory

 	then she left me to meditate in the room that had seen
 the first eighteen years of my life

   found to my surprise that i was inclined to senti-
 mentalize about it yet after all i suppose anyone would
 feel the same way coming back to their childhood home
 after a long absence

  i laughed it off what was the use i must find out
what had become of the old mans money and then clear out
there was a big world outside and work to be done and
new adventures to be found no use staying around here
i mustnt let this thing get me like this

  there came a knock on the door and little mrs south
 wick entered

by ralph durham


qleaminq tomb

his falher was wealthy when ralph
dead ihe money qone where could
qhost of the elder durham could lelll

 ive just been talking to the man who owns that piece
 of land you was asking me about he telephoned me about

 something else and i just happened to mention you and-

 she stopped in confusion

not such a good actress i thought with amusement i

 wanted to stop in and see him lives right down the square
 here a little way names higgins

  higgins  ruth higgins father id nearly forgotten
ruth but now i remembered her vividly the sweetheart
of my youth she was-the little girl whose books i had
joyfully carried home from school i fell into a reverie-
forgot all else for the time being

-and its the third house from the right
i came to with a start mrs southwick had
been giving me directions as
though i didnt know every inch
of the way by heart why i
could have found
the house blind-
folded  i thanked
her and seizing my

a shadowy form
was rising-ris-
ing out of the
earth

hat hurried downstairs
and out the front door it
was more than the desire
to learn of my fathers af-
fairs that sent me hurry-
ing down the street and
through that familiar
front gate

the house had changed surprisingly
little in fifteen years i noted as i rang
the bell when the door opened ruth
stood beiore me in all the full blown beauty of her thirty
years the same fragile loveliness but with a maturity
an added poise the same gaiety tempered now with a
touch of sadness of worldly-wisdom the younger ruth had
never known

  for a moment we stood there dumbly wide-eyed staring
at each other ami i wondered vaguely whether she recog-
nized me she waited for me to speak her face inscrutable

knew she had called the man on the phone immediately
she left me

 well now that was nice of you mrs southwick what
 did he say

 he said he might consider selling it though he wasnt
 exactly decided said hed be home all afternoon if you




ghost stories

and almost unconsciously i made my decision to see through
my original plan

  boes mr higgins live here i asked as i might have
addressed a stranger

  and in the same manner she answered me yes wont
you come in

  she lead me into the library-the same familiar library

in which we
had spent so
many happy
hours read-
ing and con-
versing and
dreaming to-
gether i s a w
that it had
changed hardly
at all a few
more books per-
haps new cov-
ering on the
furniture elec-
tric fixtures in-
stead of gas nothing more

  mr higgins is upstairs

ill tell him youre here she waited a
moment half expectant then as i did
not speak who shall i tell him is calling

  evans is the name-george evans mrs southwick
telephoned him about me a little while ago

  oh yes ill tell him and she was gone

  gad what a fool i had been why she was perfect-
simply perfect and i had lost her in one swift moment
the years had rolled back like a film baring all the old
emotions the old longings the old thrill her presence had
never failed to bring me buried there in the dust of time
i found my love for ruth as fresh as alive as blooming
as it had ever been and i had not known it was there
had not dreamed it

  i smiled quietly to myself i knew now why i had never
married there had been many girls many chances in those

fifteen years of wanderings over the world-

  my thoughts were interrupted by the entrance of old man
higgins i should hardly have recognized him so com-
pletely had the years changed his appearance and it was
quite evident that he did not recognize me he greeted me
cordially and we began to talk about the land but my mind
refused to lend itself to the subject somehow the advent
of ruth seemed to have dulled it to everything else and
time and again i found myself absent-mindedly answering
some remark of his without in the least knowing what he
was talking about finally he suggested that he drive me
out to the lake to look things over and i gladly accepted
the offer

        as he went back to get the car i made a desperate
      effort to pull myself together i was here to get
      information about my father and his affairs and i
      must get it by the time the car rolled up to the door
      i had myself fairly well in hand but i couldnt help
      glancing back at the windows of the house as we drove
      away hoping against hope for another glimpse of
      ruth-a hope that was not fulfilled

     higgins had always been a cagey old bird and
     the years seemed to have intensified this quality
     talk as i would i could get no real information out

                              of him yes he had
                              owned this land about
                              four years bought it
                              of major durham
                              knew him did i  fine
                              old man that yes he
                              did have a son left
                              home years ago though
                              no one hereabouts

with trembling fin-
gers i drew out a
long legal docu-
ment-my fathers
last will and testa-
ment

                                    knew anything about him
                                    went to sea they said
                                    some said he was dead

  was there a faint tightening of the mouth at mention of
my name i fancied so but it might have been only my
imagination

  did the old man leave any property guess not mrs
durham was living down by the car tracks in the old stoner
shack she didnt seem to have any money but then you
never could tell

  as we drove up to the higgins house again i felt utterly
baffled i had learned practically nothing i didnt already
know and had spent a whole afternoon doing it at his
invitation i followed him in to look at some photographs he
was anxious to show me	continued on page 
they hanged a phantom
for murder

in the bodq of one man the soul of another kills a woman
rou can a phantom be held responsible
by doctor qrey
told by r cummings

a s i pace back and forth in my cell in san quentin
anxiously awaiting the coming hour when i will
be hanged by the neck until dead i have no re-
mm jk morse for the crime for which i am to forfeit
my life instead an ecstasy fills my whole being
and i thrill from head to foot with expectancy

  does this sound like the words of a sane man or the
ramblings of a diseased mind past the landmark of sanity
am i sane that is the question which the world wants
answered

 will start with the beginning

 everyone is now acquainted with the bizarre and
fiendish murder case that rocked the whole pacific coast
with its gruesomeness for those not familiar with the case
i will state briefly wherein doctor grey i call myself by
this name in this narrative although known to the world
by another name a prominent los angeles dentist is
supposed to have murdered his wife by administering gas-
as used by the profession in the method of extracting teeth
there was the hint of a scandal between the said doctor
grey and his assistant whom i will call grace turner

  it all came about by my attending a spiritist seance in
hollywood being of a sensitive nature-one of those
humans endowed with something akin to the mysteries-
i sooti became an interested student of the occult as i was
blessed with a clientele far larger than my fondest ex-
pectations the occult afforded me a form of relaxation from
office hours

  on this particular night i was attending a seance i was
accompanied by my wife the hostess of the evening
there was to he a party followed by a seance conducted
by a celebrated english medium introduced my wife and
myself to a dr ralston who was quite an adept in the
study of mysticism or occultism whichever you prefer to
call it it seems he had spent considerable time in the
orient mastering mysteries of the far east

   dr ralston was several years my junior of athletic build
while i am anything but athletic he had delicately chiseled
features-almost effeminate i noticed his lips were very
thin they somehow gave me the impression of a brutal
cruelty well hidden by the veneer and polish attained
through much travel and contact with many types of people
the man had that masterful self-possession which so many
strive to attain

  i learned that he was a new-comer to the state of cali-
fornia a dentist by profession and looking for a suitable
location he was perfectly at home with the ladies and
held them spellbound with his thrilling accounts of his ex-
periences in the orient and elsewhere in his study of the
occult i noted too with annoyance that he paid my wife
quite a bit of attention at the seance no one else seemed
to notice it however and i soon forgot it

  a few days later while passing a suite of rooms in the
same building in which my office was located i was greatly
surprised to see dr ralstons name printed in large gold
letters on the door next to mine i knew that the rooms had
been vacant a short while but it never entered my mind that
of all the office buildings in los angeles with offices avail-
able that dr ralston would choose the building in which
i was located

  in the course of time we became quite friendly since i
was broadminded enough not to be jealous of my competitor
and we had many things in common he belonged to the
same lodges clubs etc that i belonged to and beside
my wife was even more interested in spiritualism than i was
and enjoyed hearing dr ralston relate his many experiences
-especially those dealing with the astral plane and soul
flights

  thus entered the snake into the garden of eden

  he became a frequent visitor to our home on occasions
that sometimes came up when i was too tired or had busi-
ness matters to clear up he would escort my wife to a show
or perhaps a lecture or whatever the occasion called for

  i would usually be in bed when they returned but one
evening as i was detained down town later than usual i
decided to leave my car which had been giving me trouble
at a garage about four blocks from our residence and walk
the remaining distance as i am light on my feet for a man
of my weight i approached the house almost silently and
was about to enter when i heard voices i recognized them
as my wife and dr ralston

the doctor was pleading with my wife to run off and
leave me and go to europe with him he was pro-
fessing his love for her in the most endearing terms i have
ever heard a man use all through his siege of love-making
my wife kept trying to quiet him assuring him every so
often that she loved me only and could never love another
man as long as i remained alive




ghost stories

to make tilings worse however and to bring matters to a
head shortly after this happening my assistant who had
been with me ever since i had opened the office decided
to get married to a meal ticket she had found out in holly-
wood and i was forced to get a new girl from among
the many girls who applied i decided upon a beautiful little
southern girl by the name of grace turner

  i believe she must have loved me from the first moment
she saw me and i must say if ever lucifer tempted man
with a more
alluring
snare than

him

he cursed me
with-god pity
she didnt inspire in
me a noble love or respect
but worked  my baser na-
ture i was tortured at night with
dreams of mad desire in which she
was the central figure

sometimes i was a king and she
was my slave in these mad dreams
sometimes we were two unfortu-
nates shipwrecked on some desert
island while in these dreams i
would toss in bed as a man stricken
with fever and would waken tired
and exhausted my night
clothes soaking wet from
the violent night sweats
that always followed the
dreams

in some unexplainable
way dr ralston gained
the knowledge that my assist-
ant was madly in love with me
one night while my wife was
attending a seance with a
woman friend he told her in
the most exaggerated terms of how i was untrue and tried
to make her belftve i was carrying on an illicit love affair
with miss turner of course my wife did not believe him
so he began planning in earnest for my destruction as he
believed if i was out of the way he would have no trouble
in winning my wife who was a wealthy woman

  i should mention here that all along the doctor was pro-
fessing his friendship for me i had never disclosed in any
way my knowledge of the night i had heard him making

from the theater before bidding me goodnight he pleaded
with me to leave you she looked up at me timidly

  i smiled at her reassuringly if there is any fault here
my dear it is not yours but i have noticed for some time
that dr ralston has been paying you marked attentions
i thought he was a gentleman and would keep in his place
hereafter you will not be annoyed by him

  so that was the end of my wife going out with the doctor

  i felt triumphant in that moment that my wife was not
losing ground and was as true and as loyal as i knew she
would always be i carried an automatic in my car as there
had been a number of holdups shortly before around los
angeles for the moment i was almost persuaded to take
it and shoot hint but from the study of the occult i real-
ized that if i took his life i would probably be earth-bound
for years trying to work out my salvation for the deed
done in a moment of passion

at this moment the doctor turned around and although
 i ducked down by the side of the porch among the
bushes i had the feeling that he had seen me anyway the
voices ceased i walked slowly around to the back door and
into my room and was soon prepared for bed

  the next morning at breakfast my wife startled me by
saying dr ralston has been trying persistently to force
his attentions on me

  i feigned surprise and asked her to tell
me all about it

  last night after he
had brought me home

what was going
to happen next 
they hanged a piia n tom for murder



some mark of identification on it and deposited it on a
solid mahogany table in view of all

  as we were early-the medium not having arrived as yet
-we had a good opportunity to view the crowd as it filled
the hall there were people from almost every walk of life
and i also noticed a number of foreigners among the mass

  presently the medium came in and took his place by the
table he had with him a little traveling bag that contained
a few pairs of slates-about six pairs if i remember rightly
and several pieces of white crayon the room was full of

                                      beautiful flowers that
                                      scented the whole hall
                                      with almost a nau-
                                      seating odor

                                         the medi-
                                       um selected a
                                       little high

         doctor ralston in my body walked up
         to my wife and smiled in my usual way

most celebrated mediums to have only persons acquainted
with spiritualism attend this precaution is taken in order
to have the conditions right for obtaining the best results
but such was not true of this seance which was open to
the general public anyone could bring his or her slate
and personal writing paper i was surprised to find the
hall brilliantly lighted since most seances are conducted in
semi-darkness under a ruby light some in fact are held
in total darkness

  most of those present had written their questions at home
the few who had not already written questions were
furnished paper and pencil we wrote our questions in
this manner first the name of the dead relative or
friend then where they passed out next came the question
last-our name and place of birth  earh person placed

                    school girl and a young man of perhaps
seventeen or eighteen years of age to
come up front and wash the several pairs of slates he had
on the table he had them also wash the private slates which
different persons among the crowd had brought with them
in all there must have been twenty or thirty pairs of slates
made ready

a fter the operation of washing and drying the slates
 the medium had the two young people pick at random
from the pile of sealed questions on his desk about ten or
twelve questions these sealed envelopes were given to
certain individuals among the crowd they were each to be
kept in the pocket and opened only after the question had
been answered

  dr ralston had brought two pairs of slates that had three
large screws in each pair to hold continued on page 

love to my wife and had heard her repulse him

  one night he called me on the phone and asked me how
id like to go to a slate writing seance to be held in venice
by a member of the british research society at the time
i thought it was rather strange that he didnt mention my
wife as she had developed into a fair medium herself
then it flashed through my mind that he would be em-
barrassed after the love-making scene in which iny wife
had called him down i assured him i should be delighted
to go and see what this medium could do

the seance was the most startling and mysterious one
 that i had ever witnessed for
those of you who have never at-
tended an in-
ti e p e n dent
slate-writing
seance i will
tell as best i
can what took
place

  it is the
general cus-
tom of the
pawn of the unseen

                                       by lyon ulearson

at the

 hen martin grimm was found apparently
  i murdered in his home a number of persons were
i i y suspected terry lenihan young bachelor who
lived just across the way was one of them so
was blood the dead mans butler so was
lenore his beautiful young niece

nevertheless detective carton who was in charge of the
case could find no definite evidence against any one ofthe
three and the coroner gave a verdict of death from heart
disease

and now strange things began to happen in that death
house where the old recluse had met his sudden and mys-
terious death while seated at the telephone ghostly foot-
steps were heard horrible mirthless laughter floated
through the empty halls a disembodied hand in a circle of
light appeared and left imprints of blood where it touched

old man grimm himself lying dead in his coffin-seemed
not to be dead for a message from him appeared on a
slate it was in his handwriting stating that no undertaker
was to be allowed to come near his body then when this
warning was ignored and the undertaker arrived the heavy
door leading into the death chamber was suddenly locked
by unseen hands

when terry with his valet marius entered the death
house to investigate terrys house suddenly burst into
flames-seemingly without natural cause the fire was
put out but its origin remained a mystery was it another
warning from the unseen powers that hovered over the old

mans body terry and marius
believed that it was but never-
theless they rushed back to the death house again to con-
tinue their investigation

  there standing in the darkness on an upper stair landing
they heard a horrible scream-a scream of agony and terror
it was lenores voice and they rushed to the door of the
room from which it came

t was only an instant that they stood outside of that door

  yet it seemed an eternity they could review their lives
to their earliest childhood in that instant much as a drown-
ing man can go back over every incident of his life in the
moment of going down for the third time

  what terrible presence lay behind that door they had no
way of even guessing yet they knew that nothing should
stop them from going into that room from which they had
heard the agonized scream that they were certain had come
from lenore perhaps she was even then lying there
already stiffening in death-a death that had come to her
swift and terrible in tone with the other happenings in
this strange house what awful apparition had appeared
to her to shock her into that piercing screaming emotional
expression what shape from another and unheard of
world what portent from the powers that seemed to rule the
darkness in this place what throwback from the twilight of
our civilization and our era

  these thoughts coursed through their brains with the


pawn of the unseen



terry and ttlarius had no warninq of lhal arrow shot
from an unseen bou to chill their blood with its
dread messaqe whal is the secret of lhal
house of mystery and death

pushed in and the
room was flooded with
light from the over-
head chandelier for an instant
they blinked in the sudden light
not being able to see anything
and somewhat dazed by this swift answer to terrys remark

standing by the switch at the door completely dressed
stood the butler blood his pale ageless face was per-
fectly composed and he bowed to them in greeting just as
soon as they recognized him how long he had been stand-
ing there-or whether he had been standing there at all-
they had no way of knowing in any event if he had been
there when they entered they had overlooked him though
it was difficult to see how yet nothing of that kind terry
reflected as he stared at the butler in a moments silence
appeared to be very difficult in this house where the most
extraordinary circumstances seemed to happen as a matter
of course

  good morning gentlemen said the dead toneless voice
of blood as he looked at them steadily quietly is there
anything i can do for you

speed of light taking only a millionth of the time it requires
to detail them for terry and marius hesitated not at all
before the door but pressed forward searchlights in hand
all fear forgotten in the necessity of aiding the woman who
had shrieked what might have been her death agony

terry plunged toward the door as though to break it in
with his shoulder he was restrained by marius

wait said marius take it easy it may be open
he put his hand on the knob and pushed inward the
door opened easily

searchlights playing before them they entered the cham-
ber that must have housed the secrets
of this house yet a rapid glance
around the long room as far as pos-
sible in the light of
their hand flash-

be anything in this room said marius glancing around
well have to examine it thoroughly-every inch said

terry finally we
need light - though
these searchlights
will have to do in a

pinch-

why not switch
on the electric
light said a calm
voice behind them
and they wheeled at
the sound as a crim-
inal does at the
touch of a hand on
his shoulder

there was the
sound of an electric
light button being

he was a
little old man
and he
ed ii
aide

asleep

room was empty they ad-
vanced to the center and played
the spots on the walls and
found nothing no human was there

i dont understand this said terry forgetting in his
excitement to whisper

  doesnt seem to be anybody here replied marius and
yet-

  we heard her-and i am sure it was from this room
said terry after all there are certain things one can
be sure of-

  i wonder replied marius succinctly

  there was a silence between them for a brief space
before terry spoke

  whatever it is thats going on here is a deep game and
you can count on that i heard lenore scream-and im
going to find out where she is and whats happening to her
if its the last thing i ever do

  im with you in that-though there doesnt seem to


giiost stories

  tliere certainly is snapped terry now complete master
of himself you can tell me how long youve been standing
there and just whats happened in this room-over there

  ii motioned to a spot just in front of the door which
wa liberally stained with fresh wet blood

q lood looked at it in silence for a space there was
 an utter absence of sound in the room-a silence preg-
nant with expectation finally blood spoke his voice
was quiet and calm as before he looked terry directly
in the eye

  i have no idea sir he said coldly

  something has been going on here- began terry

with a scarcely veiled excitement a rising anger that fed
itself on his anxiety about lenore

  why do you think so sir asked blood

  why do i think so why that scream alone-

began terry

  what scream sir asked the imperturbable blood

  why you heard the scream it was lenore-she
screamed - one
of the most ter-
rible sounds i
ever heard in all
my life you
dont mean to
say you did not
hear it why
a dead man
could have heard
it

  i heard noth-
i n g s i r no
scream  noth-
ing

  marius and terry stared at blood in an amazed quiet
born of their need for adequate expression at such a time
surely this man must be lying there was something
furtive about him-always had been there was something
sinister    something  of the night   

perry recovered control of his voice and his next
 question was rapier-like in its steely hardness

  then what brought you up here

  you replied the voice of the butler who called himself
hlood

  i said terry

  yes

   you heard us

  certainly sir replied the butler quietly

  and you came up like that all dressed persisted terry
who did not trust him at all

  yes replied the butler again

  how does it happen that you are all dressed at this time
of the morning-if you came up immediately you heard us
inquired terry not to be balked

  i heard you when you were first here-when you ran
down the stairs said the butler i dressed then because
i rather thought you might be back of course sir i had
no idea who it was-nor what your errand might be here
in this house now that the master is gone

  there was a short space of quiet and then the flat voice
of blood cut in once more

  since were asking questions sir i think im within my
authority if i ask just what you and this other gentleman
are doing here at this time of the night i dont remember
letting you in sir he added significantly

  terry was somewhat taken aback by this and hardly
knew for the moment what to reply he knew of course
that his presence there was unlawful and that he was quite
without legal right or authority in the matter if blood
chose to make trouble for him he could do so with little
difficulty terry knew that he and marius were in the

position of burglars before the law and that any judge
would quickly adjudge them guilty of breaking and enter-
ing as the legal phrase has it

  the voice of blood went on suavely calmly but
there was in it an accent that transcended that of the
butler-it was a tone of inquiring authority thinly
veiled under a mask of politeness his tones dripped
with ice

  you see until some member of the family-or estate-
arrives to take charge i am in complete charge here i
should therefore be familiar with everything that goes on
here-and with everyone who enters or leaves

  terry cut in on him angrily

  it doesnt seem to me that you know a great deal of what
goes on blood-or if you do you contrive to conceal it
more than a little i think i can tell you more of what
is going on here than you can tell me at least more than
you wish to tell me it seems i see ill have to speak plainly
to you

  i dont know what you mean sir just what is there

                                       that is going
                                       on as you put

  said

terry that
rcrearn for in-
stance you
stated that you
did not hear it
now both of us
here heard it-
very loud and
terribly plain
it is not possi-
ble that there is
anybody in this house who did not hear it i am only sur-
prised that it hasnt yet been reported to the police by the
neighbors and yet you have the face to stand there and
tell me you didnt hear it

  i tell you blood there is a great deal that you know
that is going to be of interest to me-and to the police
terry paused significantly here to let this threat sink in
hut it produced not a ripple on the sinister calm of the
butler some day i intend to find out what it is why
that scream could have been heard by martin grimm who
is lying dead downstairs and it would not be the first
thing that he heard deaf as he was in life and dead as
he is now-that you claimed you did not hear

  i dont know what you are referring to sir said blood
and his cold face was emotionless

  yes you do know what i am referring to went on
terry but if you want it plainer ill tell you i am
referring to the unexplained footsteps that one can hear
in this house they are not made by any one who lives
here a deaf man could hear them yet you claim you
have not heard them

  im sorry but the deaf are subject to hallucinations
about sounds-

tj allucinations nothing im not deaf and

   neither is miss lenore we both of us heard them
on more than one occasion if youre concealing anything
blood i warn you that its going to go hard with you you
want to know what im doing here and ill tell you since
you have the face to ask i am not satisfied with the ex-
planations of the death of my friend martin grimm i
think there is more here in this house than has met the eye
and im going to find out about it and as for your being in
charge here-you were in charge until i came mr grimm
had no kin except miss lenore as you well know and as
the fiancee of miss lenore i have taken charge here until
she herself appears on the scene and makes whatever dispo-
sition of affairs-and of you-that continued on page

why should anyone-
man or qhoul-wani lo
lormenl an innocenl
child

   by arthur branscombe
   told lo dictor rousseau

ut my dear mrs temple why were you not
satisfied to let well enough alone demanded
  doctor martinus brusquely you had established
a little shrine in that room of yours you had
filled it with happy influences but you were not
content to leave that little haunt for the hallowed spirit to
revisit in its dreams why did you throw that bolt into the
mechanism of the astral universe

 well doctor you know people were beginning to talk
 about it and to say that my mind had become unhinged
 through brooding and my friends said it was heathenish
 they told me that my dear little doris is now an angel in
 heaven and that i shall meet her there when i die but until
 then there is no possibility of our knowing anything about

each other and so i-

 and so you ran to a charlatan a mere dabbler in psychic
 matters-of which he is and always will be ignorant said
 martinus savagely

 but doctor-mr craven has a very strong spiritualistic
 power and he assured me that he could lay the spirit for
 ever and so i let him try

 and instead of the little shrine you got a full-blown
 haunted house said martinus how long after this man
 craven performed his operations in that room did these
 manifestations begin

 three or four days doctor said mrs temple tearfully

 at first i thought it was my darling doris-

pulling hair and pinching and throwing glass and
crockery martinus snorted

 mr craven said it was an after-manifestation that would
 soon disappear

 and what did your heart tell you demanded martinus
 why it-it told me-

 it told you it was a devil and it was right the doctor
 shouted very well madam ill come and see what i

 can do hereafter rely more upon your bible and less on
 fools like craven and remember the passage about the
 seven devils you drove out the legitimate tenant and
 its place was taken by one devil-or seven that we shall
 see good afternoon mrs temple

   doctor martinus turned to me when our visitor had
 departed

   sometimes when i get a case like this i almost despair
 branscombe he said that mrs temple is the wife of a
 wealthy mining man now out west they have a big house
 here in new york last year they lost their little girl and
 she was almost distracted with grief

   she did what the natural instinct of nearly every mother
 bids her do she collected the childs toys and her favorite
 doll in the bedroom and turned the place into a little

that came to

against the
wall tvaa a
stand on
which was

an enor-
mous doll
propped up
b e n e a t h
three light-
ed candles

shrine-just as the japanese do when their loved ones die
and because the act was so simple and so natural and be-
cause nothing that is evil can pierce the armor of a mothers
love she turned that little room into a channel through
which the loveliest influences descended to bless that home

ou can picture the dreaming soul of the child revisiting
 its home and finding there everything that it had
known-its toys a mothers love and the mother who spent
a good part of her time there sewing or doing other do-
mestic duties because as she expressed herself it was the
happiest room in the house

  what happens the neighbors begin to talk they
say her mind has become unhinged then her friends per-
suade her that it is a heathenish practice-that the dead are
cut off for ever from the living so she goes to this man
craven this quack spiritualist who knows nothing whatever
about the real spiritualism and-he
comes on a visit of inspection

  he sees the doll and the toys and he
persuades the mother that the spirit of
her child has become earth-
bound as he phrases it and
that the mother is wrecking her

childs heavenly happiness by drawing it down from realms
of bliss to an earthly environment as if there could be
any greater bliss in heaven than the remembrance of a
happy childhood

  what does he do mumbles some incantation perfectly
efficacious not because it is a charm but because of the
intent that underlies the words this faker breaks up the
shrine lays the doll away in a cupboard turns the bed and
furniture around so that the child shall not recognize the
room and goes away telling the mother that the spirit is
laid

  that was six weeks ago branscombe three days after
that the manifestations began our friend craven had
turned the shrine into a typical haunted house

i had not been in the room during the beginning of the
doctors conversation with mrs temple you mean that
noises are heard things thrown about and so forth  i
asked and i heard something said about pinching
and pulling hair

    yes all the typical phenomena of the poltergeist
    responded martinus and that ass craven insists
    that these manifestations proceed from the spirit of the
    child angry that it has lost its earthly home stark
    nonsense

               i remember i said you once told me
                                        that these noisy hauntings generally had a
                                        merely physical explana-
                                        tion you referred to the
                                        fact that in ev-
                                        ery such case
                                        as reported from

                                        there appears to

investigators-that with the advent of maturity the etheric
or so-called astral body on which the human frame is
modeled becomes capable of enormous extension the child
discovers that it has the faculty of throwing articles-glass-
ware or crockery-from a distance by grasping with the
extended etheric hand when it is detected in the act of
throwing even from a distance the trick is proclaimed and
the explanation is considered obvious but that is neither
here nor there there is no mischievous boy or girl of
about fourteen in this case it is a case of a genuine
haunted house and the haunter is not the child doris but
one of the devils that enter into empty houses

  but let us drop the subject for the present branscombe
said martinus we have an engagement to visit mrs
temples home to-morrow afternoon and then we shall see
what we shall see

person apparently in his early forties in a semi-clerical
coat and a clerical collar-pompous over-fed and evidently
obsessed with the idea of his own importance he greeted
martinus with a touch of condescension-as a professional
might greet an amateur

  pleased to meet you doctor he said mrs temple
has been telling me about your work well we psychic
dabblers must stand together whether inside the church or
outside-eh doctor he chuckled

  martinus looked at him blankly but that did not dis-
concert him mrs temple intervened tremulously

  mr craven has been so kind as to promise to co-
operate with you doctor she said i thought two heads

might be better than one if-

  i thought martinus would explode but he did nothing
of the sort i shall be delighted to have mr cravens co-
operation he said with a cynical smile

the house which was about ten years old was a large
one standing in some small grounds and well set back
from the noisy street a maid in a cap and apron opened
the door the interior showed some standards of taste
and advanced ones of comfort as we entered we heard a
mans high rather shrill unpleasant voice in the living-
room mrs temple who was in conversation with him
appeared embarrassed

  doctor martinus let me introduce you to mr craven
she said

  martinus who had not presented me to mrs temple in
his office did so now and i was introduced to craven in
turn he did not impress me favorably a stout florid

rthats fine boomed craven nothing small about
us researchers is there doctor  we cant afford to have
any petty jealousy of each other the subjects too vast
yes-as big as the universe replied the doctor or
as small as a bath-room he added with a meaning glance
at me just as we make it you know mr craven

  i knew he was thinking of the character in one of dos-
toievskys novels who spoke
of death as a possible im-
prisonment instead of a
release craven saw
nothing sardonic in
the remark

well have you
seen the room since
ive altered it again
lie asked we might
go up mrs temple
yes doctor ive pul
everything back again
exactly as it was be-
fore im not ashamed
to own where ive
made a mistake
theres nothing petty
about me doctor

it was a pretty lit

the quarter-acre of

the law of-karma declares lhal evil deeds bring
their reward in kind if forber and roberson
could have known in youlh the terrible price
they would pay-
by colonel tlorman q thiwaites

it was expected of hetty delvilles guests that they
should do something more than eat her very excellent
dinners when invited to her attractive house in fact
unkind folks said that unless you earned your dinner
by useful conversation you were never likely to be
invited to her spacious london mansion again

  she was not a lion hunter in the ordinary sense of the
term she merely aspired to provide something that made
people talk-and she succeeded one heard such phrases as
curious thing i heard at hettys the other night and then
would follow a strange story or a weird and wild solution
of some political problem sometimes she would have no-
body more intellectual than a young subaltern who had done
something worth while-a v c or an escaped war prisoner

  she trifled with the esoteric and had some leaning towards
spiritism i confess her dinners were sometimes worth
while i was not a lion nor a raconteur but i was a good
listener and as t once told her i will always listen to a
lie once

  this story is the latest yarn i heard at hetty delvilles
table i give it for what it is worth just as it was offered
by the man who told it

  conversation had been led by hetty in her favorite direc-
tion-hypnotism ghosts premonitions etc then major
hardman with a string of letters after his name gave
tongue it was what he was there for

  hardman is one of those rather unusual persons who sits
silent when talk is general but always appears to be able
to speak an epilogue that enhances the value of everything
that has gone before we settled back in our chairs pre-
pared to hear something good this is his story

cince you have touched on the mysterious i should like
to tell you of a curious experience i had for which i offer
no explanation but which even now i cannot think of with-
out shivers down the spine

  some years ago i made a trip to east africa i did a
bit of shooting but my main purpose wras to make a report
on conditions out there for a certain group of capitalists
as a matter of fact the information was also to be passed
on to the colonial office

  by chance i ran across a man who was one of the pioneers
in the coffee growing business near nairobi there were
not many british settlers in those days this chap called
himself forber-gerald forber his real name i dis-
covered was very different he had been in the congo at
one time and various other parts of africa he claimed to

know every race and tribe on the continent and could
handle the black man better than anyone else

  forber certainly had an uncanny power over the natives
who worked for him one came across bis tracks wherever
one went chiefs and medicine men and humble bearers
knew all about hitn he was not liked and i confess i did
not take to the fellow but a white man in the wilds is not
over fastidious

  i spent a week on my way up country with forber and
on mv return had a few days more with him on this
occasion he had a fellow named roberson staying with him
as far as i could make out roberson was a sort of traveling
agent for him in addition to coffee planting they ran
some mysterious business of which they said nothing

  roberson was a rather good-looking man but was marked
by dissipation he drank a great deal i noticed i found
myself wondering why i had accepted forbers invitation
to stay with him on my way back i did not like the man
and roberson was even less to my taste

j owever there were certain reports to be completed
  and mailed home before i could leave so  decided to
put in the time with forber rather than be alone as a
matter of fact it was very hard to refuse forber anything
he was a man of extraordinary force and when he was
thwarted in anything he overcame obstacles by a sort of
concentrated earnestness that somehow suggested a menace
i had the greatest difficulty in persuading him to let me
go on the date i had fixed he was most anxious to keep
me a few days more he lived very comfortably most
of his servants were east indians excellently trained and
curiously eager to serve him in fact they were cowed-
whipped-doglike i might almost say

  we parted with the usual promises to meet again ex-
changed club addresses and talked conventionally of the
damned good dinner we would have when we foregathered
in london some day

  it must have been two years later when one evening as i
entered the junior sports club the hall porter said a gen-
tleman had been to see me not half an hour before and he
handed me his card it was gerald forber he had told
the porter he would call later i had no very keen desire
to see forber again but as i had some interests in east
africa at that time and information at first hand being
always useful i told the porter to give forber my address
and telephone number

  at eight oclock as  was about to leave my rooms the


wiia t a man sows-



he closed the
door

 he led me
into the sitting

room forber was gazing at the window
attention to me he was breathing heavily
was ghastly pale his collar was ripped off
was open at the front on his throat i noticed
finger marks and across his forehead was a
from which ran a small stream of blood i
two men had been fighting

  heres hardman said roberson

  forber sat up then sprang to his feet but

he paid no
and his face
and the shirt
at once were
long scratch
thought the

still keeping

at the window grad-
ually they both grew
more composed for-
lier repeated that it
was good of me to come

presently after a few stupid re-
marks from me and little more than grunts from forber
they appeared to regain some measure of sanity

  you will think all this very strange hardman forber
remarked but roberson and  have had a rather trying
time i cant explain it but i felt that the presence-the

presence- his mind seemed to wander and his eyes

turned to the window again roberson too was staring
round the room furtively with sudden quick twists of the
head it was uncanny

  then forber resumed the continued on age 

telephone rang a voice  did not recognize asked whether
 was in then an agonized breathless voice exclaimed
that you hardman for gods sake come round to
no-pall mall i must see you top floor    come
at once

  i replied that i was going out and asked who was speaking

  this is forber roberson is with me i we want to
see you come quickly i the voice had the sound of
terror in it

   said i was sorry but forber was not to be put off
he begged me to come round after dinner for some reason
 was curiously annoyed i answered that i could not
promise anything with that i rang of

  throughout dinner with some stodgy family friends
my mind returned again and again to the memory of
that anguished voice the result was that at ten
oclock i made my excuses and went to the address
given

  i was obliged to walk up four flights of stairs as
the lift had ceased running i had hardly touched
the bell of flat no  when the door was flung open
by roberson

  thank god youve come he said forber is
in an awful state i looked at the man he was
white and haggard drops of perspiration stood
on his forehead and his hands were trembling as

his eyes on the window with a concentrated and terrified
gaze he grabbed me by the hand thanks for coming
he said hoarsely

  there was a curious musty smell in the room that i found
very unpleasant both men were very hot although the
room was cold there was a small fire in the grate but it
seemed to throw out no heat

  well i said whats the trouble you fellows look
a bit agitated i kept an outward appearance of noncha-
lance but i confess i felt far from comfortable roberson
had sat down and he made a queer attempt to laugh forber
was mopping his brow both men kept stealing glances

 cursing under
 their breath

the outer door downstairs was closed with a sharp
click and the two men who had entered began to
ascend the well worn stairs as the sounds of foot-
steps and jerky conversation became louder the
lurking shadow at the door of john tempests
rooms resolved itself into the figure of a young man who
appeared to listen and then
as a pair of eyes rose above
the level of the corridor floor
to move softly away and be
lost in the dimness which lay
beyond the bracket light-
hut not before charles
walters had caught a startled
glimpse of that excessively
pallid face

  a look of puzzlement
flitted across walters fea-
tures-a phrase died un-
spoken on his lips he au-
tomatically paused tempest
brushed past him and stepped
to his door

  tempest was a large man

he wore an ulster over a
rough weave gray suit a
soft hat was pulled down over
his face walters was round
of feature keen of eye-a
certain type of london bar-
rister neat in his conven-
tional dress suit and dark
overcoat

  tempest pushed open the
door and turned to his com-
panion

  are you coming in

walters 

  eh no i think not

thanks

  whats the matter you
seem upset all of a sudden

  i-im all right said
walters hastily he peered
down the hall with an anxious
look in his eyes that he
could not disguise then as
if ashamed of his action and
with an attempt at a smile
he repeated im all right

tempest

  ill take your word for
it said tempest jovially

do come in for a little

walters its early yet

   walters hesitated

  ive got to be in court
early tomorrow morning it

must be midnight now i must get my sleep to keep fit

  nonsense another ten minutes wont kill you tempest
urged come in and have something to drive out the chill
that lecture hall was as cold as a tomb just a drop of
whisky for a night cap a cigarette with me and you can
go upstairs

well-all right then a drink sounds tempting but

i cant stay

  as he followed tempest
he looked once more along
the corridor with the same
puzzled stare then closed
the door

  we need something after
that hour and a halfs tor-
ture said tempest tossing
his ulster and hat on a
chair i always thought
professor capri was a fool
now im sure of it
walters took off his coat
and hat with slow delibera-
tion and laid them down
carefully standing with
his back to the open fire
he nodded

  ugh ninety minutes
on suicide jove he
glanced around the room
youre cosy in here
tempest looked up from
the tray set with glasses
and a decanter

  youd scarcely think
there was much to be said
on the subject of suicide-
apart from the medical and
legal aspect

  or that anyone would
care to sit and listen to it-
yet good heavens the hall
was packed lot of women
too what on earth do you
suppose they went for
same reason as our-
selves i imagine-curiosity
well heres your drink
heres to a well filled brief
bag old man cigarette
i would have liked to
have seen into the brains
of some of the people
there and found out what
they were thinking of

his stubby forefinger was raised--as
though to say to the tenant who would
now occupy those rooms next


four creeping walls

the personality o a living oreathinq
know the irulh-

wallers smiled though faintly

 if you had pried off my skull-
 cap youd have found i was
 thinking id have had a lot more fun watching a chorus of
 pretty girls i fancy most of our distinguished fellow
 auditors were thinking of much the same

capris a crank extraordinary looking man i must
say he spoke very convincingly too

es walters agreed there were times i was really

impressed only-well that statement of his that

 fifty per cent of humanity is on the verge of suicide was a
 bit far fetched

 of course if he had his way no doubt hed have you
 and me labelled as potential suicides tempest laughed
 heartily us im too fond of life as for you walters

with the world in front of you-suicide bosh

bosh is the word but then the public will swallow
anything these days

anything but the truth have a drop more

no thanks

want a clear head tomorrow eh said tempest as he
helped himself generously quite right you know i can
stand a lot of guff walters im open to be convinced on
most any subject-ifit is supported by logic and proof
but when capri gets up on his hind legs and blandly states
that a man for no known cause will end his life with a
messy knife a revolver or a dose of poison-thats too much
for me a poor devil whos driven to the wall
and sees no way of escape-yes thats possible

but a man who has no mental taint who has
money hope ambition health-to kill himself

why thats arrant nonsense

 yes replied walters from his chair where
 be sat gazing thoughtfully into the fireplace i
 agree with you only there have been cases
 of fcl-dcx-se where no earthly cause could be
 discovered

 id like to see
 the case tempest
 retorted

walters looked about him re-
flectively what a delightful
room it was with its dark wood
panels its carved fireplace its low book shelves well filled
and the italian cabinet which held tempests collection of
coins comfort tradition-it had everything that a students
room should have he had an idea that its beauties were

wasted  tempest even the tragedy of young-

 well said tempest sharply

a case eh take the case of young- walters

 paused oh well perhaps i shouldnt

go ahead man case of whom tempest prompted
perhaps i shouldnt have brought it up continued
walters with apologetic reluctance but as an instance
take the case of the poor devil who had these rooms before
you there was a mystery if ever there was one

 a look as if of irritation
 crept into tempests eyes

yes-from all accounts

by robert sneddon

walters did
not notice
that in the
doorway
someone
stood point-
ing at him




ghost stories

youre the one who first discovered him here werent you
walters pointed to the archway dividing the room they
were in from the bedroom beyond

  he was lying there poison not a scrap of writing to
explain excepting three words on an old envelope three

words-without sense this damned room-those were

the three words

is affairs were all in order and he had money in the
bank his life was insured three months earlier
and he had a clean bill of health so far as i could learn
not the slightest trace of hereditary insanity existed no
reason-absolutely none-for him to kill himself

   didnt your legal acumen discern any trace of the usual
woman asked tempest with a trace of sarcasm

  he was engaged to be married the girl was crazy
about him and he about her walters answered simply
-so that theory is out

  how about accident

  no one but a fool takes prussic acid by mistake what
on earth would
he have prussic
acid for any-
way- but the
one thing

 t empest
pointed to a vial
on the mantel
shelf

 what am i
doing with cy-
anide of potas-
s i u m  you
wouldnt infer
that i mean to
poison myself
because i buy
cyanide to clean my coins

  no id never suspect you of designs on your own life
tempest but-some sudden impulse coming from god
knows where swept that poor devil out of his sanity it
interests me it puzzles me some of these times im

almost tempted to lie in wait for him and ask him-

  tempest stared then burst into a loud laugh

  ask him good lord you amaze me walters surely
you arent on the level of mentality of old briggs the care-
taker you surely dont believe that yarn of his tempest
paused and stroked his chin thoughtfully but  hope
to heaven he doesnt carry out his threat to leave us hes
a thoroughly capable fellow old briggs is even if he is
overcredulous and acts like a fool at times

  what would you say if i tell you i have seen young
halliwells spirit walters asked abruptly

  id say you had more to drink than was good for you
tempest told him boisterously

  do you think i am drunk nowr

  eh-no what are you getting at

  just this said walters slowly-as we came upstairs
 saw him-at your door

  saw the poor devil who killed himself here in this room
tempests eyesbrows raised and he smiled sarcastically oh
come come walters-i didnt think capri could hypnotize
you that badly

  walters leaned forward earnestly

tm not easily persuaded of anything tempest-you know
l that when briggs came to me with his story of seeing
this thing i laughed at him in fact i said the same thing
as you said about me-too much to drink but-well-
ive changed my opinion this is the third time ive caught
a glimpse-just a fleeting glimpse of someone-or soine-
ihing-that is the image of young halliwell

  youre usually such a sane being walters but this

statement rather shakes my faith in you you dont mean
to infer that this wretched thing haunts the house a
ghost come-youre telling me that youve seen a ghost
thats a hit too much for me to swallow wrapped in a
sheet i suppose

  no very much as he was in life only his face was very
white and drawn he wore a dark suit  couldnt mistake
him tempest

  tempest laid dowrn his cigarette and looked at walters
steadily then he burst into a loud laugh

  very good excellent why old man you almost had
me believing you with that solemn old owl manner of
yours i see now how you hoodwink juries

  tempest rose to his feet with a wink and took an ex-
aggerated pose a slight impersonation of a well known
figure in legal circles he said mockingly gentlemen of
the jury as  came up the stairs on the evening of december
the twentieth on the stroke of midnight i saw before me
in front of the door giving entrance to the rooms of john
tempest the apparition of a pale young man which i state

here and now
without fear of
contradiction
sustained by the
evidence of my
own eyes by my
own unshakable
conviction b y
the confirmation
of a mind ac-
customed to
weigh every tri-
fle thrice over-
was no other
than that of a
person whom i
know to le dead

in fact gentlemen of the jury it was the ghost of-

no old man tell that to the marines or to one of your
trusting juries but not to me have another whisky

 thanks replied walters smiling faintly well
i see theres no use talking to you tempest but
seeing is believing you know

  yes said tempest drily and ive heard of circum-
stantial evidence falling down with a crash ill wait until
i see this ghost of yours  give you my word i saw nothing
as we came upstairs and i flatter myself my eyesight is as
good as yours my friend well its growing late i mustnt
keep you any longer

  walters rose and yawned

  i dont feel like it hut ive half an hours reading in
front of me tonight before i turn in

  ill wait up a little myself said tempest er-you
say you found him here did you

  yes just over there under the arch-head in the bed-
room legs curled up in this room not a pleasant sight by
any means

  tempest walked slowly over to the spot and stared down
at the dark flooring

  im afraid one of capris theories is all wrong you
remember he said something about the psychic trace of a
suicide

  no i didnt catch that what was it

  oh some crazy notion to the effect that a suicide leaves
some sort of impression on the place where he takes his life
he goes out unhappy unexpressed and leaves some-how
shall i put it-atmospheric depression a certain lingering
horror is it possible halliwell left his gruesome influence
on this room but im damned-if i feel anything one way
or the other i have nothing but a desire at present to sit
down smoke a pipe and toddle off to bed after that my
brother-in-law fond of a joke you continued on page

doctor travers
called loudly there
ivas no answer-save
the rustling of the
leaves

edwin travers eminent psy-
chologist and well known authority on
spiritism is visited by dr grover a
leader among the skeptics opposed to the
professor the doctor asks travers to
investigate the strange trance-like actions of his
pretty daughter evelyn

  professor travers magnanimously overlooks the
doctors opposition to his beliefs and teachings and consents to
visit the girl to try to unravel the mystery of the spells she
is subjected to that are such a source of worry to her parents

  professor travers learns among other things that the
notorious ronald tracy found dead from shock shortly
before had tried by threats and every other means to
obtain possession of the doctors old colonial manse
groverly near jamestown virginia to use as his head-
quarters for the dreaded devil cult-the red circle

  almost as soon as the professor arrives at the manse
evelyn falls into one of her spells and talks apparently
in the person of another being all are thrown into con-
sternation including her fiance robert briton young news-
paper man who is present a little later sam negro
butler hurries in reporting that the doctors police dog
rex has met sudden death from the scratches of a great
black cat that hovers about the place dr grover makes
a chemical test and finds that the dog died of poison-
poison scratches

  these happenings are not altogether a mystery to pro-
fessor travers who considers that they have a psychic
cause they do afford however an opportunity to furnish
to evelyns father incontestable proof of the existence of
a spirit world in constant communication with the living
in fact travers is resolved that he will win the doctor over
to his teachings and beliefs in regard to the unseen world
and he figures that these strange happenings will prove to
be the very means to help him most in this

jt was with these thoughts on his mind as the sun was
- approaching the horizon that the professor reached
the old manse feeling refreshed after an hours walk to the
ruins of jamestown and back the declining solar rays
cast grotesque elongated shadows of the old elms that lined
the driveway a few decades ago it had been a dirt road
now it was of decomposed granite with cement sidewalks
and expansive lawns on either side

  he halted and surveyed the old house in fascination the




ghost stories

structure was typically colonial of brick with green
shutters and a large veranda that ran the entire length of
the house spaced with round white columns the doctor
had taken him through it that morning explaining the
various changes that had been made in the structure as
he viewed it now he noted that the original
building comprised the right wing consist-
ing of the living-room dining-room
kitchen and servants quarters downstairs
and four bed-rooms and a bath-room
upstairs the upper right corner
facing the front he knew to be
evelyns room he had been as-
signed the room next to it and the
doctor and mrs grover
were directly across the hall
which ran parallel to the
front of the building

  the old section was
covered with ivy and
a huge ancient bogan-
villea spread its pur-
ple bloom up the side
of the veranda and in
between the upper
windows spreading
over the roof at the
corner where the brick
fireplace reared its
chimney an old grape-
vine ascended an ar-
bor to evelyns win-
dow laden with half-
grown fruit

  the new section
was half the size of
the original and was
also covered with vines though
not so thickly downstairs a hall-
way led off from the living-room
in the old section to a music-room
a library combination laboratory
and operating-room and a small bed-
room in the back that was used for
storage purposes upstairs were four
guest rooms

phe lengthening shadows of the
 tall elms bathed parts of the old
manse in a premature dusk moving
splotches of sunlight on the walls
filtering through waving branches
gave a strange animate effect to the
ancient abode the shutters stirred
slightly in the breeze with their win-
dows seeming like so many monstrous
eyes travers visualized the veranda
with its white columns as a huge
mouth the house as a squatting-mon-
ster waiting to devour passers by

  the stories you could tell he
muttered to the brooding pile tales
of the birth of america the revolu-
tion-the civil war-

  he walked on and a car swept into
the driveway he recognized evelyn
grover the doctor and young robert
briton and removed his cap to them

  well professor exclaimed dr

grover as the party stopped in front
of the house did you enjoy your
walk

yes indeed said travers bowing

to miss grover and robert this is a historic old country
hereabouts he exclaimed i poked around jamestown
today

  didnt bump into captain john smith did you pro-
fessor laughed evelyn jumping from the car

  no said travers with a smile nor patrick henry nor
your old tenant andrew brainard

                             daddy exclaimed
                             evelyn did you show
                             professor travers our
                             cannon ball 
                             by tove

all the
time tra-
cey stood
eyeing me
it waa dia-
bolical

   no i havent come professor you must see
   that old relic

        he led the way around to the rear of the
 building and pointed to a half round protuber-
 ance near the left corner just under the roof
 painted a dark color

   a relic of the revolution said the doctor
 we keep it painted so it will not rust see
 its half imbedded in the wall

   they say george washington was in the house
 at the time said evelyn -it was his head-
 quarters for over a week

   they went into the house discussing this
 ancient memento of a long-dead british artillery-
 mrs grover greeted them brightly as
 sam the aged negro butler ushered them in

   mammy janes got dinner nearly ready she
 said she glanced anxiously at her daughter

   oh im all right mother laughed evelyn
 getting out today did me a world of good bob
 beat daddy playing golf

        the doctor grinned

        darned if the young scamp didnt make
        an eagle he said the last hole in one

       yes laughed bob and the doctor
       charged me with having planted the ball
under the spell of the red circle



there the night before shows how much faith he has in me 

  they dressed for dinner which was served in the ancient
dining-room with its blackened beams peg-fastened a ven-
erable colonial buffet and other old pieces of furniture
surrounding them the dining-table itself had been pointed
out to travers earlier in the day it was of black walnut
of the finest quality over two hundred years old and
priceless

cam waited upon them with simple efficiency mammy
jane had prepared an old-fashioned southern chicken din-
ner with yams and corn-pone that put conversation to shame
travers was charmed both by the savory cooking and the
democracy in the grover household the two negroes evi-
dently loved and were almost a part of the family sam was
spoken to and made replies while serving frequently cutting
in on the conversation of the others there was an utter
absence of restraint yet his manner was always profoundly
respectful travers had never felt more completely at ease in
his life the doctor made a few joking remarks to sam about
the black cat which the aged
negro said had not been seen the
rest of the day

  the subject of the house was
brought up by the doctor and
remained the main topic of
interest

  its terribly old said
evelyn and sometimes it has
a depressing effect upon me

i dont know how to describe

hen hazlitt saw the stranger at his desk his
emotions were distinctly unpleasant upcher
might have given me notice lie thought he
wouldnt have been so high-handed a few months

ago

  he gazed angrily about the office no one seemed aware
of his presence the man who had taken his desk  was
dictating a letter and the stenographer did not even raise
her eyes its damnable said hazlitt and he spoke loud
enough for the usurper to hear but the latter continued to
dictate the premium on policy  has been so long
overdue-

  hazlitt stalked furiously across the office and stepped
into a room blazing with light and clamorous with conver-
sation upcher the president was in conference but
hazlitt ignored the three directors who sat puffing con-
tentedly on fat cigars and addressed himself directly to
the man at the head of the table

  ive worked for you for twenty years he shouted
furiously and you neednt think you can dish me now
ive helped make this company if necessary i shall take

legal steps-

  mr upcher was stout and stern his narrow skull and
small eyes under heavy eyebrows suggested a very primi-
tive type he had stopped talking and was staring directly
at hazlitt his gaze was icily indifferent-stony remote
his calm was so unexpected that it frightened hazlitt

  the directors seemed perplexed two of them had stopped
smoking and the third was passing his hand rapidly back
and forth across his forehead ive frightened them
thought hazlitt they know the old man owes every-
thing to me i mustnt appear too submissive

  you cant dispose of me like this he continued dog-
matically ive never complained of the miserable salary
you gave me but you cant throw me into the street with-
out notice

  the president colored slightly our business is very
important- he began

j azlitt cut him short with a wave of his hand my
l business is the only thing that matters now  i want
you to know that i wont stand for your ruthless tactics
when a man has slaved as i have for twenty years he
deserves some consideration i am merely asking for
justice in heavens name why dont you say something
do you want me to do all of the talking

  mr upcher wiped away with his coat sleeve the small
beads of sweat that had accumulated above his collar his
gaze remained curiously impersonal and when hazlitt swore
at him he wet his lips and began our business is very

important-

  hazlitt trembled at the repetition of the mans unctuous
remark he found himself reluctant to say more but his
anger continued to mount he advanced threateningly to


 the head of the table and glared into the impassive eyes of
 his former employer finally he broke out youre a
 damn scoundrel

   one of the directors coughed a sickly grin spread itself
 across mr lpchers stolid countenance our business as

 i was saying-

   hazlitt raised his fist and struck the president of the
 richbank life insurance company squarely upon the jaw
 it was an intolerably ridiculous thing to do but hazlitt was
 no longer capable of verbal persuasion and he had decided
 that nothing less than a blow would be adequate

   the grin disappeared from mr upchers face he raised
 his right hand and passed it rapidly over his chin a flash
 of anger appeared for a moment in his small deep-set eyes
 something i dont understand he murmured it hurt
 like the devil i dont know precisely what it means
 dont you shouted hazlitt youre lucky to get off

cfhe man idho died
  tdice
     in death as
  in life hazlitt
  was futile
  spineless in-
  effect ual
  then came
  one glorious
  opportunity

something has come between
us said hazlitts wife  feel
it like a physical presence

with that ive a good mind to hit you again but he
was frightened at his own violence and lie was unable to
understand why the directors had not seized him they
seemed utterly unaware of anything out of the ordinary
and even mr upcher did not seem greatly upset he con-
tinued to rub his chin but the old indifference had crept
back into his eyes

  our business is very important- he began

  hazlitt broke down and wept he leaned against the
wall while great sobs convulsed his body anger and abuse
he could have faced but mr upchers stony indifference
robbed him of manhood it was impossible to argue with a
man who refused to be insulted hazlitt had reached the
end of his rope he was decisively beaten but even his
acknowledgment of defeat passed unnoticed the directors
were discussing policies and premiums and first mortgages
and mr upcher advanced a few commonplace opinions
while his right hand continued to caress his chin

  policies that have been carried for more than fifty
years he was saying are not subject to the new law it

is possible by the contemplated-

hazlitt did not wait for him to
finish sobbing hysterically he
passed into the outer office and sev-
eral minutes later he was descending
in the elevator to the street all
moral courage had left him he felt
like a man who has returned from
the grave he was white to the lips
and when he stopped for a moment
in the vestibule he was horrified at
the way an old woman poked at him
with her umbrella and actually
pushed him aside

the glitter and chaos of broad-
way at dusk did not soothe him he
walked despondently with his hands
in his pockets and his eyes upon the
ground ill never get another job
he thought im a nervous wreck
and old upcher will never recom-
mend me  dont know how ill break the news to
helen

the thought of his wife appalled him he knew that
she would despise him shell think im a jellyfish he
groaned but i did all a man could you cant buck up
against a stone wall i can see that old upcher had it in
for me from the start i hope he chokes

   he crossed the street at rd street and started leisurely
westward it was growing dark and he stopped for a
moment to look at his watch his hands trembled and the
timepiece almost fell to the sidewalk with an oath he
replaced it in his vest dinner will be cold he muttered
and helen wont be in a pleasant mood how on earth
am i going to break the news to her

hen he reached his apartment he was shivering he
sustained himself by tugging at the ends of his mus-
tache and whistling apologetically he was overcome with
shame and fear but something urged him not to put off
ringing the bell

   he pressed the buzzer firmly but no reassuring click
answered him yet-suddenly he found himself in his own
apartment i certainly got in he mumbled in an im-
measurably frightened voice but i apparently didnt come

through the door  or did i  i dont think im
quite well

  he hung up his hat and umbrella and walked into the
sitting room his wife was perched on the arm of his
morris chair and her back wras turned towards him she
was in dressing gown and slippers and her hair was down
she was whispering in a very low voice my dear my
darling i hope you havent worked too hard to-day you
must take care of your health for my sake poor richard
went off in three days with double pneumonia

  hazlitt stared the woman on the chair was obviously
not addressing him and he thought for
an instant that he had strayed into the

a woman passed
through him hor-
rible he groaned

there isnt any-
thing to me
at all im
worse than a
jellyfish

wrong apart-
ment and
mistaken a
stranger for
his wife but
the familiar

lines of her profile soon un-
deceived him and he gasped
then in a blinding flash he
saw it all his wife had be-
trayed him and she was
speaking to another man

  hazlitt quickly made up his
mind that he would kill his
wife he advanced ominously
to where she sat and stared
at her with furious bloodshot
eyes she shivered and
glanced about her nervously

the stranger in the chair rose and stood with his back to
the fireplace hazlitt saw that he was tall and lean and
handsome he seemed happy and was smiling

  hazlitt clenched his fist and glared fiercely at this in-
truder into his private home

  something has come between us said hazlitts wife
in a curiously distant voice i feel it like a physical pres-
ence you will perhaps think me very silly

  the stranger shook his head i feel it too he said
its as if the ghost of an old love had come back to you
while you were sitting on the chair i saw a change come

over your face i think yon
fear something

  ill make you both fear
something shouted haz-
lilt he struck his wife on
the face with his open hand
she colored slightly and
continued to address the
stranger its as if he had
come back it is six months
to-night since we buried
him he was a good hus-
band and i am not sure that
i have reverenced his mem-
ory perhaps we were too
hasty jack

  hazlitt suppressed an
absurd desire to scream
the blood was pounding in
his ears and he gazed from
his wife to the stranger
with stark horror his wifes
voice sent a flood of dreadful mem-
ories welling through his conscious-
ness

e saw again the hospital ward
where he had spent three days of
terrible agony gasping for breath
and shrieking for water a tall doc
tor with sallow bloodless cheeks bent
wearily above him and injected something
into his arm then unconsciousness a
blessed oblivion wiping out the world and
all its disturbing sights and sounds

later he opened his eyes and caught his
wife in the act of poisoning him he saw
her standing above him with a spoon and
a bottle in her hand on which was a skull
and crossbones he endeavored to rise
up to cry out but his voice failed him and
he could not move his limbs he saw that his
wife was possessed of a devil and primitive horror
fastened on his tired brain

he made dreadful grimaces and squirmed about
under the sheets but his wife was relentless she
bent and forced the spoon between his teeth i
dont love you she laughed shrilly and youre
better dead i only hope you wont return to
haunt me

hazlitt choked and fainted he did not regain
consciousness but later he watched his body being
prepared for burial and amused himself by thinking that
his wife would soon regret her vileness i shall show
her what a ghost can do he reflected grimly i shall
pay her for this she wont love me when im through
with her

there had followed days of confusion hazlitt
forgot that he was only a ghost and he had walked
into his old office and deliberately insulted mr
upcher but now that his wife stood before him
memories came rushing back continued on page

lovely hair growth please note

amazing experience
of one who was saved
from life-long bald-
ness through koskott

 r had a very bad case of
alopecia areata writes mr
barnes it had advanced so far
that every single hair on my head
was gone and to make matters
worse my eye-brows and eye-
lashes fell out too

  i paid out  to a noted
scalp specialist for a special
treatment in the hopes of effect-
ing a cure at the time he took my
case he very frankly told me that
he would not make any promises
as it was the worst case he had ever
seen to be brief at the end of six
months treatment there were
perhaps one hundred hairs scat-
tered over my scalp-and those
were very weak in fact they
were so weak that i hardly dared
massage my scalp for fear of
having them fall out and within
that time not an eye-brow nor an
eye-lash appeared

  then by accident it seems i
came across your little book en-
titled perfect hair ever since
that day i have always thought of
it as the psychological moment i
immediately started using your
preparations without missing a
single day i followed directions
faithfully today my faith is re-
warded by having a fine head of
hair my head is completely
covered with hair

         ctimely ctopics of current interest

here are still witches-in
new jersey

  legally they still exist in the
state that lies across the hud-
son river from new york one
can still he jailed for being a witch and
for practicing witchcraft in the flourish-
ingly modern cities of newark trenton
where woodrow wilson was once
governor and the other great indus-
trial communities of the state

  some years ago a woman who claimed
to be a female preacher was arrested in
newark charged with being a witch
within the meaning of the statute at
that time it was said that the police of
the city were conducting a private war of
their own directed at witches with a wiz-
ard squad specially detailed for the job

  all this seems preposterous but it is
all true the woman minister who was
arrested on the charge no good would
be served by mentioning her name
here was the head of a ghost cult as
the papers called it and she was ac-
cused of communing with evil spirits

  michael long who was at that time
chief of police in newark was quoted
as saying about the case

  this woman is a witch within the
meaning of the statute the informa-
tion that she gives out at her circles
breaks up homes one man complained
to us that his wife had become a raving
maniac as a result of the things she
told her newark has made up its mind
to get rid of witchcraft

  all this was a number of years ago
and yet so far as can be learned the
law still prevails moreover such laws
persist today in many states although
the voters do not dream they are still
in force

  of course the belief in witchcraft is
older than the bible its practice is
gravely condemned in the mosaic scrip-
tures and it was by the authority of
such condemnations that many old
women were burned in new england
there were sorcerers anil sooth-sayers
in the days of ancient babylon and
egypt in the famous code of ham-
murabi who lived  years b c
and who was a contemporary of abra-
ham appears this law

  if a man has laid a charge of witch-
craft upon a man and has not justified
it he upon whom the witchcraft is laid
shall-plunge into the holy river and if
the holy river overcome him lie who
accused him shall take himself to his
house

  apparently the earliest record of a
witch being burned to death is in the
year  the witch confessing that
she fed her offspring the flesh of babe
at toulouse in  sixty-three per
sons were accused of being witches
eight of whom were burned to death
and the others were imprisoned for life

one of the most famous trials in the
united states was that of grace sher-

wood of princess anne county vir-
ginia who in july  was put into
water above mans depth to try how
she swims

  according to connecticut laws
adopted in  but so far as is known
never repealed anyone that be a witch
or consulteth with familiar spirits shall
be put to death

  one of the most serious problems to-
day in the philippines is the native be-
lief in witchcraft

one of the most persistent beliefs
in the rural portions of the united
states is that good luck attends anyone
who possesses a piece of the rope with
which a criminal is hanged after
hangings in maryland there is always a
division of the rope one baltimore
druggist exhibited in a showcase dozens
of pieces of rope about the length of a
mans finger and attached to each was
a tag bearing the name of the felon
whose neck was broken by the rope

one of the great occult waves of the
present century was that of the
ouija board during the war it leaped
into amazing popularity the fame of
patience worth and other psychic celeb-
rities was achieved on its shining sur-
face with the black letters and numbers
and the little moving table

  how did the ouija board originate

  its history is most undistinguished
its inventor was a baltimore manufac-
turer-a man who sold billiard tables
and who was looking for an addition
to the line he put out the ouija board
as a hazard regarding it purely as a
game just as today in the novelty and
toy shops you will find many other
fortune telling games that have no con-
ceivable importance in the minds of
serious people but the ouija board
surprised william fuld the man who
patented it over night it became a
blazing meteoric success he had to
turn his billiard table factories into
ouija board factories he even licensed
other manufacturers to produce the
boards under his patents

  president wilson had one in his home
and it was said even to have predicted
his first election sir william barrett
conducted grave experiments with it
science and religion examined it de-
bated it praised it with hosannahs or
denounced it with anathemas as be-
came them scarcely anyone ignored it

  meanwhile mr fuld continued un-
expectedly to get rich on his ouija
board to this day he doesnt under-
stand it

an amazing case of psychic power
has just come to light through the
reports of the celebrated doctor osty
one of the most famous of all the
scientific investigators of such phe-
nomena

  this case involves the recovery of

lost property and here are the facts
considerably abbreviated as reported by
doctor osty-

  in may  mme s went from
paris to versailles -for the day to visit
friends she was wearing a valuable
diamond star and on returning home
missed the jewel

  no trace could be found she was
taken to see mme morel who held one
of her gloves-mme s sitting in a
corner of the room while her friend
spoke to the clairvoyant

  mme morel who works in a light
state of hypnosis asked what am 
about to see about this woman she
was told look for something that is
troubling her at this moment she said
she is distracted about the loss of
something  a large jewel shining
and valuable it is not lost it is hidden
and will be restored  i follow this
lady as she leaves her home in an auto-
mobile with another person    she
goes to a town near here  i do not
know its name    she visits three
houses    the jewel has fallen near
one of them  i see it picked up by
a woman young very stout with light
eyes and hair the jewel has been
locked up she thought of keeping it but
is afraid    she will restore it before
the week is out no police measures
should be taken    she will give it
back

 mr s who had informed the
mayor of versailles received a letter
four days later summoning him to that
town and the jewel was restored by a
workman whose sister had picked it up
the man was stout and very fair in
coloring mr s did not see the sister
whom he supposed to resemble her
brother

  in passing it should also be remarked
that this is one of many hundreds of
such cases assembled with painstaking
and discerning care by doctor osty

a certain celebrated medium has
written the editor of this depart-
ment making two startling predictions

  one of them is so grave in its char-
acter that we are withholding it for
reasons of public policy if by any sad
chance it should be fulfilled we shall
refer to this item and then publish her
prediction

  however she also makes another
prophecy which we feel under no obli-
gation to withhold

  president calles will send troops
over the border and invade american
soil she says in her letter

  now note this important point

  many mediums make vague prophe-
cies which can mean almost anything
these are called delphic but this
woman has left herself no avenue of
escape she has made two definite pre-
dictions we are making a public rec-
ord of them here in case we should
have cause to refer to them again


ghost stories

the tdoman idith two souls



frame i watched with dimmed eyes
while norma followed the retreat of
nothingness never missing a step over-
looking no slightest turn or flutter of all
they had faithfully practiced together
for that dance until she was back on
the miniature stage and the curtains had
closed upon her

  bcrtolli i said then shall we
applaud 

the old man turned his face to me
i could not understand the look in
his deep eyes it seemed to be fear
held in check by his terrific power of
will

  i think we shall do best to sit very
still he said slowly i had re-
proached myself for not providing music
but i see now it is not needed yes we
must sit still my friend there may be
danger

  danger to her i exclaimed

  to us perhaps who can say

  bertolli i was angry for the mo-
ment danger from my little girl but
his hand closed imperatively on my
knee-again only for an instant-and
as i leaned indignantly toward him
he shut his eyes and crossed himself
once more i glanced quickly at the
stage the curtains of the frame were
parting

 the roman scene was on she was
following the act through without omit-
ting a detail in this scene two glad-
iators with swords and shields-very
light swords and shields-had charged
and counter-charged threatened and
fled about the stage never again would
there be two that thought stabbed me
through like steel but i bit my lips
until i could taste the blood and kept
silent if this was the price of sanity
for her this play-acting that wrenched
my very heartstrings because of its sug-
gestion of other days then i must pay
the price i did not even hide my eyes
like bertolli i watched her dance
through the whole of the complicated
scene exactly as she had done in the
days irrevocably gone when sally danced
opposite but now no one danced
opposite

 the mock duel ended as had the
previous scene in the picture frame
this dance depicted a fight to the death
-the dying gladiator story norma
the one who was to die pressed both
hands to her breast at last and slowly
sank to the miniature stage as her
hand drooped and the closing curtains
hid her i thought poignantly of another
figure in armor sword held aloft and
face exulting in victory whose presence
should have completed the picture was
norma too thinking of her i did not
know i could not understand what
strange fancies found place in that bent
head

  a shiver went through bertollis stout
body as the curtains came together
great blotches of sweat stood out on
his forehead

  dio mio grant that it may be over 
he groaned thickly i can not stand
it longer it is too much oh my

continued from page 

friend let us go while we may but
before i could find words to calm his
strange agitation he pulled himself to-
gether with an attempt at a smile
what foolishness is this i say we
can not go we will not go it is her
mind that is at stake we do our part
if we look and are silent ah god in
heaven it comes again

he was trembling and with the last
words his teeth chattered the
strength the self-control seemed to
have passed to me

  steady bcrtolli i urged uncon-
sciously using the very word with which
he had held me together a few minutes
before but he continued to quiver and
to mutter to himself throughout the last
dance my eyes quickly left him i was
watching with a heavy heart the grace-
ful figure of my little girl this last
scene had been a love passage of old
new york sally swain had pressed
her advances at first timidly then with
greater assurance as the climax of the
act was reached on norma the slender
old-fashioned girl in flounced skirt and
bonnet so alike were they that the
roles could have been reversed and i
am sure none of the audience would have
known

  i watched my old-fashioned girl now
trip through the graceful movements
advancing retreating running away with
laughing face over her shoulder-yield-
ing at last in that finale-again staged
within the broad picture frame-she was
to lean backward supported by her
sisters arms i wondered how norma
would do this some of the other move-
ments had seemed almost impossible for
one dancer alone yet she had not varied
them from the standard of the act

  ah how i knew that act i if she had
changed it in the slightest i could have
detected the difference she had changed
nothing yet now she would have to do
so not even her flexible muscles could
take that position unsupported i waited
she leaned backward-backward-farther
-yet farther a smile on her face i
cried out and tried to rise but bertolli s
iron hand held me down

then my eyes were opened and i saw

 there were two dancers my little
girl was supported by a ghost figure-
the figure of sally

  with staring eyes and pounding heart
i looked at them-but only for the space
of a breath-then the curtains of the
frame closed a moment later norma
still in the dress of old new york
stepped down to the stage looked about
her wonderingly then flung herself weep-
ing upon the hard boards-and i forgot
my fear-forgot everything except that
she needed me

  i ran faster to her than bertolli but
i heard him exclaiming as he lumbered
after me

 she has found tears to the good
god give thanks she has found tears
and her mind-it is saved

  not until she was calmer and softly
weeping in my arms did i know that
the past hour was gone from her the

curtain of her memory had been rung
down when something had passed to her
from her dying sisters eyes it did not
rise again until she found herself bitter-
ly weeping upon bertollis stage what
she had done that night was to be a
blank forever

two years later norma and i came
to bertollis with another act i my-
self was her dancing partner but i had
little to do for in that short time she
had become the greatest of them all
palvini-premier danseuse of the age
you will recognize the name i know
it is the one she took when she began
to dance alone to me however she is
not the great palvini but my norma

  on the first night of this engagement
bertolli and i sat in his little office at
the theater and talked of the days that
were gone it is a good place in which
to recall such things this dingy room
of bertollis yellow with age and mel-
lowed with tobacco smoke for the walls
are covered from floor to ceiling with
pictures out of the past i think anyone
of note who has ever trod that stage
has something there a photograph per-
haps or a letter in faded ink or it may
be only a sere and torn scrap of a
program with a name on it our pic-
ture hangs directly over bertollis desk
the girls in their page costumes i be-
hind them one hand on the shoulder
of each

  that night bertolli leaned back in his
chair and a shadow crossed his wrinkled
face as he looked through the clouds of
his own tobacco smoke at the picture

  in a long life filled with many won-
derful experiences that was the most
wonderful he said solemnly

 i knew what he was thinking of
the memory of that dance came back
to me and i looked away for a moment
with a lump in my throat

  did she ever remember it he asked
gently

  i shook my head

  yet she was completely cured there
was no-what shall i call it-no break-
down of the mind

  i could answer him emphatically on
that point

 she showed normal grief-nothing
more i assured him then the feeling
of what i owed the man came to me
bertolli you were right if we had
not remained silent and let her do as
she wished that night her mind would
have broken i am sure of it

  he smiled at me-a grave inscrutable
smile

  i have spent many hours my friend
thinking about that night i have tried
to explain it to myself

  i must have stared at him perplexed
for he went on slowly

 those two-they were twins they
were very close to each other-much
closer than most sisters was that
not so

 he had opened a long-pent well of
emotion i told him of my girls there
had been a bond between them indeed
all through their lives though they had


g ii  st s tor i e s

been two in body they had seemed one
in soul  rambled on and told him
stories of their childhood and of the
years afterward when again and again
as i had seen they knew each other
thoughts without words i told him too
of that long strange look between them
at the last he did not interrupt me
but nodded from time to time with his
same odd smile

 norma dances even better than she
used to do lie observed irrelevantly
when i had finished

  twice as well 

  listen my friend he leaned for-
ward and his eyes held me all my
life it has been given me to know and
to see certain things which many people
do not-you understand-the things of
the spirit that night you too saw
something

 two dancers-both my girls-at the
last i answered him finding the words
slowly it was hard for me to speak
of that even then

  but only at the last he persisted
i nodded

  i knew it would be so from the be-
ginning of the dance that night the two
were there but i feared to show the
other to you i feared for your reason
my friend i was careful not to touch

the

  he was a thin emaciated ghost but
he could make himself felt nothing
but vengeance remained to him and he
did not intend to forgive his wife it
was not in his nature to forgive he
would force a confession from her and
if necessary he would choke the breath
from her abominable body he ad-
vanced and seized her by the throat

 he was pressing with all his might
upon the delicate white throat of his
wife he was pressing with lean bony
fingers his victim seemed sunk into a
kind of stupor her eyes were half-
shut and she was leaning against the
wall

the stranger watched her with grow-
ing horror when she began to cough
he ran into the kitchen and returned
with a glass of water when he handed
it to her she drained it at a gulp it
seemed to restore her slightly i cant
explain it she murmured but i feel
as if a band were encircling my throat
it is hot in here please open the
windows 

  the stranger obeyed it occurred to
hazlitt that the man really loved his
wife worse luck to him  he growled
and his ghostly voice cracked with emo-
tion the woman was choking and
gasping now and gradually he forced
her to her knees

  confess he commanded tell this
fool how you get rid of your husband
warn him in advance and he will thank
you and clear out if you love him you
wont want him to suffer

  haiitts wife made no sign that she
had heard him youre doing no good
at all by acting like this he shouted
if you dont tell hfm everything now

you when that other was visible for
with the touch my power of sight would
pass to you also but at the last the
strain was too great i forgot for one
moment and when i put my hand on
your knee you saw

i could not reply to him at once
in the presence of this old man whose
eyes beheld the soul i had become very
humble he smiled at me and waited
lor the question which i think he knew
was coming

 you said that you could explain-

i ventured at last but he shook his
head gently

  i am not so sure of these things my
friend i said only that i had tried to
explain it to myself now that you
have told me of the last message which
passed between them-the message or
one soul speaking to another through the
eyes-perhaps i am surer when their
eyes met she who was about to pass
into the world of spirits took control of
her who was to linger in this world
it was a wise and loving control it
steadied a mind that was about to break
they were so close these two that
when the one was taken the other could
not remain sane without help until the
critical moments were over

man idho died

           continued from page 

  ill kill you ill make you a ghost

    the tall stranger turned pale he
  could not see or hear hazlitt but it was
  obvious that he suspected the presence
  of more than two people in the room
  he took hazlitts wife firmly b the
  wrists and endeavored to raise her

    in heavens name what ails you he
  asked fearfully you act as if someone
  were hurting you is there nothing that
  i can do

    there was something infinitely path-
  etic in the womans helplessness she
  was no longer able to speak but her eyes
  cried out in pain    the stranger at
  length succeeded in aiding her he got
  her to her feet but hazlitt refused to
  be discouraged the strangers opposi-
  tion exasperated him and he redoubled
  his efforts but soon he realized that
  he could not choke her he had ex-
  pended all his strength and still the
  woman breathed a convulsion of baf-
  fled rage distorted his angular frame
  he knew that he would be obliged to
  go away and leave the woman to her
  lover a ghost is a futile thing at best
  and cannot work vengeance hazlitt
  groaned

   the woman beneath his hands took
  courage her eyes sought those of the
  tall stranger it is going away it is
  leaving me she whimpered i can
  breathe more easily now it is you who
  have given me courage my darling

    the stranger was bewildered and hor-
  rified i cant understand whats got
  into you he murmured i dont see
  anything you are becoming hysterical
  your nerves are all shattered to pieces
  hazlitts wife shook her head and
  color returned to her cheeks it was
  awful dearest you cannot know how

 and help was forthcoming sally
waited to give it before she passed on
i think too my friend that in the final
dance she conferred upon her sister her
portion of the genius they had in com-
mon you see for the first time then
your norma was complete-if i may call
it that they had been mutually de-
pendent  now she depended on no one
the cord was cut which held her back
from greatness that is how i explain
it but it is only my surmise i am not
certain

  she was my daughter i cried with
a sharpening of the old grief i had
thought long buried why could i not
see her from the first why was she
hidden from my eyes until you touched
me 

  the old man shrugged his shoulders
and smiled

  who shall answer that my friend
who shall say why so few of us ever
see into the reality of the great mystery
of life that surrounds us and why are
they who have sight given a glimpse of
it so seldom

  i shook my head i was thrown into
deep thought

  no one knows said the old man -
no one can answer that question it is
one of the things we leave with god

twice

i suffered you will perhaps think me
insane but i know he was back of it
kiss me darling help me to forget
she threw her arms about the strangers
neck and kissed him passionately upon
the lips

  hazlitt covered his eyes with his hand
and turned away with horror despair
clutched at his heart a futile ghost
he groaned a futile weak ghost  i
couldnt punish a fly why in heavens
name am i earthbound

 he was near the window now and
suddenly he looked out a night of
stars attracted him i shall climb to
heaven he thought i shall go float-
ing through the air and wander among
the stars i am decidedly out of place
here

 t was a tired ghost that climbed out
l of the window and started to propel
itself through the air but unfortunately
a man must overcome gravitation to
climb to the stars and hazlitt did not
ascend he was still earthbound

  he picked himself up and looked about
him men and women were passing
rapidly up and down the street but no
one had apparently seen him fall

  im invisible thats sure he reflected
neither upcher nor the directors nor
my wife saw me but my wife felt me
and yet im not satisfied i didnt ac-
complish what i set out to do my wife
is laughing up her sleeve at me now
my wife she has probably married
that ninny and i hope she lives to re-
gret it she didnt even wait for the
grass to cover my grave i wont trust
a woman again if i can help it

  a woman walking  the street passed
through him horrible he groaned

can he really play a girl whispered
heavens nol arthur exclaimed he
never played a note in his life

they laughed when i sat down
at the piano
but when i started to play-

 rthur had just played the rosary

 - the room rang with applause i
 j decided that this would be a dramatic
 moment for me to make my debut to
 the amazement of all my friends  strode
 confidently over to the piano and sat
 down

 jack is up to his old tricks some-
 body chuckled the crowd laughed they
 were all certain that i couldnt play a single
 note

  can he really play i heard a girl whisper
  to arthur

 heavens no arthur exclaimed he
 never played a note in all his life    but
 just you watch him this is going to be
 good

  i decided to make the most of the situation
  with mock dignity i drew out a silk hand-
  kerchief and lightly dusted off the piano keys
  then i rose and gave the revolving piano
  stool a quarter of a turn just as i had seen an
  imitator of paderewski do in a vaudeville
  sketch	v

 what do you think of his execution
 called a voice from the rear

 were in favor of it came back
 the answer and the crowd rocked with
 laughter

then i started to play

  instantly a tense silence fell on the guests
  the laughter died on their lips as if by magic

  i played through the first bars of beethovens
  immortal moonlight sonata  heard gasps
  of amazement my friends sat breathless-
  spellbound

  i played on and as i played i forgot the peo-
  ple around me i forgot the

  hour the place the breathless
  listeners the little world i
  lived in seemed to fade-seemed
  to grow dim-unreal only the
  music was real only the music
  and the visions it brought me

 visions as beautiful and as
 changing as the wind blown
 clouds and drifting moonlight
 that long ago inspired the mas-
 ter composer it seemed as if
 the master musician himself
 were speaking to me-speaking
 through the medium of music
 -not in words but in chords

not in sentences but in exquisite melodies

a complete triumph

   as the last notes of the moonlight sonata
 died away the room resounded with a sudden
 roar of applause  found myself surrounded
 by excited faces how my friends carried on
 men shook my hand-wildly congratulated
 me-pounded me on the back in their en-
 thusiasm everybody was exclaiming with
 delight-plying me with rapid questions  
 jack why didnt you tell us you could play
 like that    where did you learn-
 how long have you studied-who was
 your teacher

   i have never even seen my teacher i re-
 plied and just a short while ago i couldnt
 play a note

there isnt any thing to me at all
im worse than a jellyfish

 an entire procession of men and
women were now passing through his
invisible body he scarcely felt them
but a few succeeded in tickling him
one or two of the pedestrians appar-
ently felt him they shivered as if they
had suddenly stepped into a cold shower

  the streets are ghostly at night
someone said at his left elbow i think
its safer to ride

 hazlitt determined to walk he was
miserable but he had no desire to stand
and mope he started down the street
he was hatless and his hair streamed in
the wind he was a defiant ghost but
a miserable sense of futility gripped him
he was an outcast he did not know
where he would spend the night he
bad no plans and no one to confide in
he couldnt go to a hotel because he
hadnt even the ghost of money in his
pockets and of course no one could see
him anyway

  suddenly he saw a child standing in
the very center of the street and appar-
ently unaware of the screaming traffic
about him an automobile driven by a
voung woman was almost on top of the

johnny

when i was tour years old in those
days murray hill still retained its
pristine glory as manhattans mid-town
social centre only a scattering of shops
had encroached and the tall grim
loft buildings had not yet appeared to
shut out the air and sunshine refine-
ment culture and quiet had not yet
yielded to the demands of manufacture
and trade the kind which always brought
squalor dingy tenements and rumbling
truck in its wake

in that period the tenement in which
johnny and his mother lived was a
proud old house of ornate design five
stories in height and with a scrolled
balcony of iron stretching across its
parlor floor

  and there had lived the huntingtons
the universally beloved archer hunting-
ton and his beautiful wife dolly
archer had been a great shipping mas-
ter and a financial power in the street
a man of enormous wealth for those
days but with all their materia pros-
perity the huntington home had lacked
the one thing to make it complete-a
child

 one had come-a little boy but he
had been taken away before a year had
passed there had been no other how-
ever though childless archer and his
wife had loved children with a passion
which surpassed all other interests for
them their home always was the play-
ground for the little ones of their rela-
tives and friends and dolly despite
the frail little body which made her al-
most an invalid went about daily into
the homes along the waterfront looking
after the needs of the children of the
poorer families

  archer backed her splendidly in these
efforts but his big days came with

boy before hazlitt made up his mind
to act

  he left the sidewalk in a bound and
ran directly towards the automobile
he reached it a second before it touched
the child and with a great shove he
sent the near-victim sprawling into a
zone of safety but he could not save
himself the fender of the car struck
him violently in the chest he was
thrown forward and the rear wheels
passed over his body

  for a moment lie suffered exquisite
pain a great weight pressed the breath
from his thin body he clenched his
hands and closed his eyes the pain
of this second death astonished him it
seemed interminable but at length con-
sciousness left him his pain dissolved
in a healing oblivion

the child picked himself up and be-
gan to cry someone pushed me
he moaned i was looking at the lights
and someone pushed me from behind

  the woman in the car was very pale
i think i ran over someone she said
weakly i saw him for a moment when
i tried to turn to the left lie was very
thin and worn she turned to those

christmas when he could gather chi
dren about him to his hearts content
the day before christmas in an old hall
far down in the bowery he held open
house for the youngsters of the citys
poor where there was a gigantic tree
ablaze with colored candles and long
tables heaped high with goodies and
ice cream and candy to follow

  however it was after the feast when
old archer was truly in his element
for then clad in scarlet cap and fur-
trimmed coat with shining boots that
reached almost to his hips he played
santa claus heaping toys into the arms
of each eager child as it filed past him
and he looked the part for he was
short and stout with a waistline that
stretched the belt about his gaily colored
doublet and framing his laughing eyes
and ruddy cheeks was a mass of snowy
whiskers that made artificial disguise
unnecessary

  in the evening in his great stone man-
sion just off the avenue there would be
another celebration-a splendid christ-
mas eve party to which would flock
the children of his friends and again
he would play saint nick and help
happy dolly distribute the creams and
favors and pass about the presents taken
from a glittering tree with each little
ones name written upon the wrapper

  and it was at santa claus hunting-
tons that i attended my first christmas
party i was an excited wide-eyed little
miss whose great hope was fulfilled
when santa claus huntington himself
gave me a big doll with flaxen hair that
could say mamma

however that was my only party
there for the following summer
archer and his wife steamed away in a
acht for port in the south seas where

who had gathered near where did
you carry him to she asked

  they shook their heads we didnt
see anyone madam you nearly got
the kid though drivers like you should
be hanged

  a policeman roughly elbowed his way
through the crowd that was fast gather-
ing whats all this about he asked
is anyone run over

  the woman shook her head i dont
know i think i ran over a tramp   
a poor thin man lie was  the look
in his eyes was terrible    and very
beautiful i   saw him tor a mo-
ment just before the car struck him 
think he wanted to die

 she turned again to the crowd
which of you carried him away she
asked tremulously

  shes batty said the policeman
get out of here you he advanced
on the crowd and began dispersing them
with his club

 the woman in the car leaned over
and looked at the sidewalk a puzzled
mystified expression on her pale fea-
tures

  no blood or anything she moaned
i cant understand it

it was hoped the warmer breezes would
restore the roses to dollys cheeks but
the yacht never reached its destination
and though my father archers life-long
friend and business associate conducted
a world-wide search for it neither the
boat nor its passengers were ever heard
of again

  my father as well as others of archers
intimates knew that somewhere in the
house he always kept a considerable
store of ready cash for emergencies-
such as his own and dollys charities
or to aid less prosperous friends in need
of loans for which no papers would be
signed or interest exacted this hiding
place known only to him was hunted
for repeatedly but never uncovered

 then followed long years in which
the old house remained closed and its
windows boarded up the neighborhood
changed ugly business structures el-
bowed their way in workmen de-
scended upon the old houses that re-
mained altering them inside and out
dividing the great rooms into smaller
ones-making them over into beehives
for humans and into these tenements
moved those who were compelled to
count their pennies-the overflow of the
poor from five points hells kitchen
and mulberry bend

  finally the huntington estate was dis-
posed of my father purchased the old
house hoping for sentimental reasons
to rent it as it stood thereby preserving
its outward appearance at least but he
had failed in that objective no one
wanted a whole house in that teeming
tenement district so though my father
continued his ownership he permitted it
like its neighbors to be rebuilt into
small flats

  in those years my mother had died
leaving only me to care for dad but

kellys christmas qhost

       continued from page 
ghost stories



though his hair became thin and frosted
though the old fire in his eyes was re-
duced to smouldering embers and he
laughed only when he and  were alone
in the great library at night the blow
of losing the woman who had stood by
him through his early struggles did not
sour him

  in archers time dad always had as-
sisted him in carrying out his plans
to make children happy though he al-
ways kept in the background after his
partner disappeared he continued to
carry on the labor of love but in his
own way his nature would not permit
him to play santa claus but on each
day before christmas with his pockets
bulging with bills and a car loaded with
toys lie visited the homes of every em-
ployee of his bank and personally dis-
tributed his gifts to the children and left
money for their entertainment at a
theatre or elsewhere on the holiday

  today as usual he must have been
out among his little friends i hoped
he wasnt very tired for dad was get-
ting older the spring in his step-

the raucous shout of the train guard
roused me from my reverie al-
though i did not catch his jumbled
words i knew instinctively i had reached
the station nearest my home and join-
ing the jostling crowd i left the train
climbed the sodden steps and again
headed out into the storm which had
increased in intensity

  but still buoyed up with thoughts of
what i had planned to do for johnny
that night i made speed over the few
blocks which brought me to where i
knew dad would be waiting-probably
anxious because i was returning later
than customary

  as judson swung wide the front doors
i tossed my dripping coat and hat upon
a chair and burst into the library with
a cry of dad dad where are you
but i was sorry i had been so pre-
cipitate for he had been dozing in
his big chair before the fire-place one
hand shading his eyes and i noted
those eyes were tired-very as with
tony you little gadabout where have
you been until this unearthly hour he
came to his feet arms outstretched a
great smile driving the wrinkles of
fatigue from his features

  sit down dad-after the first big
hug and kiss  forced him gently back
into his chair and drew another beside
him youre all worn out tonight
have you been overdoing things
nothing of the kind tony girl and
he slipped a hand over and held one
of mine besides and he chuckled
it was in a good cause-and only once
a year you know but tell me-where
have you been

 oh doing the same as on every
december twenty-fourth only a little
more so there seemed to be so much
to talk about everywhere and-well i
stayed longer n places than i expected
never mind if you didnt get wet
feet let me see no fine now ill
order some coffee and well have a nice

comfy chat until the chimes-

  youre a dear dad but-i cant do
more than drink one cup then i must

be off again--

 you must--what do you mean

  dad fm really ashamed of myself

but you remember the kellys-

  you mean bridget and little johnny
he nodded

  yes and would you believe it i
all but forgot them

 then as his eyes opened wide in
thoughtful interest i told him how i had
recollected my lapse my subway trip on
my last nickel and what the thought of
the kelly tenement had recalled-my
first christmas eve party and archer
huntington playing santa claus

  thats strange tony he interrupted
his brows coming down into a pucker
it seems as if ive been thinking of
good old archer most of the day my-
self sometimes i felt almost as if he
were near me particularly when i was
with the children maybe tony girl he
was closer than i knew we cant tell
do you know dad recalling archer
made me think of the money still hidden
away somewhere in that old building
and i also thought-if only the kellys
had found it-what a glorious christ-
mas present it would be for them

 it certainly would he smiled
but that money is gone-at least until
the wreckers tear down the house now
let us get right down to the practical
side of your predicament i suppose
you want  some money to make good to
little johnny

  yes dad heaps of it im going to
give him the best christmas he ever
had im going to try to atone for my
forgetfulness dad-make good to the
memory of santa claus huntington for
that first splendid christmas he gave
me

  dads hand went into his pocket and
came out clutching a roll of bills which
he thrust into my fingers

  make it the kind of a christmas for
johnny youve been thinking about-
then add a little more for archer

  oh dad ill do it and ill thank
you more tomorrow when i have time
a big kiss and im off

  but tony its a bad night i think

id better go with you and-

 no dad ill dress warmly and-

 but-

  no buts dad i sat upon the arm
of his chair drew his head about until
i looked full into his eyes and brushed
a strand of gray from his forehead i
know youre game to go if i say the
word but youre tired-far more than
you realize

  besides this is my job i overlooked
a real duty now i must make good
it wont take as long as you think if
you want to wait and doze and smoke
here well say merry christmas to-
gether maybe with the chimes ill use
the big car this time no more being
caught with but a nickel carfare if
youd rather go to bed i wont mind
for i want you fresh and rosy tomor-
row when you must be santa claus
for me

ll right tony ill telephone to
jim and reddy to bring the ma-
chine around while youre getting ready
youll need both of them with you to
help carry the bundles and-well if you
should have a blowout on such a

night-

  nothing like that is going to happen

i cried giving him a final hug and kiss
and dashing away but he followed me
into the hallway shouting good luck
over and over again as i hurried to my
room my precious roll of bills clutched
tightly in my hand

  while changing to a heavier dress and
directing minnie to strap on a pair of
arctics as a further protection against
the drifts through which i must wade
while making my purchases i thought
of mrs kelly and the probably meager
covering she possessed to shield her
against weather such as the night had
brought

  in a closet was a heavy coat with
cuffs and collar of fur which i had
bought for the housekeeper she and
mrs kelly were about of a size it
would meet the emergency splendidly
the widow should have the coat and i
would give the housekeeper money to
get another

 it hung over one arm and my purse
with the money for the kellys christ-
mas gifts was over the other when 
again headed out into the snow

  where to miss queried jim while
reddy helped me into the car and tuckeil
a big warm robe about me

 hurry over to upper broadway-
some place where the shops are certain
to be open i must get a lot of toys
and candy and-things then were go-
ing over to murray hill you know
where the kelly family lives

 another moment and we had turned
the corner and were lurching ahead
horn rasping our lights penetrating but
little through the blanket of whirling
flakes in front but we reached the av-
enue safely and the shops still were
open caring for last minute purchasers
like myself

ith reddy at my elbow i plunged
in and out of several making my
purchases quickly while bill after bill
disappeared from the roll of yellow and
green backs i bought toys and candy
and more toys and fruit-until reddy
informed me the car was pretty well
filled but i only laughed there must
be room for a few more parcels i had
promised myself that johnnys christ-
mas was to be a bumper one and 
was determined he should fare as splen-
didly as any boy in all new york

  my final errand was to a neighbor-
hood department store where the weary
clerks already were preparing to close
i am going to leave all choice to you
i said to a man behind the nearest
counter i want a number of things
for a five-year-old boy of slight build

and about so high-two pairs of shoes

rubbers two suits an overcoat a fur
cap gloves and a box of wool stockings
dont show them to me but give me
the best and please hurry

  i dont believe i ever was happier in
my life not even at my first christmas
party as the car zig-zagged its way
across town and down toward murray
hill even archer huntington if he
were looking down upon me must have
smiled at my effort to follow in his
footsteps for somthow i seemed to
feel that he was responsible for the joy
of giving which i always had known
at christmas time when we finally
drew up before the ramshackle old build-


chost stor ies

ing which housed the kellys with only
a lighted window here and there to re-
lieve its dull front i caught the echo
of chimes from some nearby church
luished and muffled by the storm till
they sounded like some wayside angelus
belis

  christmas had come it was the mid-
night hour when santa claus must star
upon his all important journey

  i latighed happily as i stepped from
the car while reddy closed the door be-
hind me merry christmas boys
wait here until i come back i want
to make certain johnny is asleep then
we can take the gifts to his mother i
carried only the coat which was to be
my personal gift to bridget kelly

  as i entered the hallway i encoun-
tered the janitress reaching aloft to
turn the sputtering gas flame to a mere
speck the customary illumination for
those of the tenements who returned
home after midnight

  she pushed her spectacles closer to
her eyes then and can it be yourself
miss gregory and on such a night and
so late ill he certain tis the kellys
you came to see but she isnt home
why she cant be working so late
no but one of the neighbors down
the blocks been taken sick shes gone
to help im lookin in on johnny while
shes away but hes asleep now i
just came from up there the doors
open if youd care to go up

  thanks ive some christmas things
for them ill just make certain johnnys
still asleep then ill have them put in
mrs kellys kitchen you can tell her
theyre there when she returns

  bless you miss theyll sure be ap-
preciated this year bridget hasnt been
able to work much lately and the doc-
tors cost a lot o money i fear she
couldnt get much for the laddie for

christmas and-

  yes

  well dont says as i said so but i
guess they been a eatin pretty poorly
for the last week

i drew another bill a twenty from
my almost depleted roll then went to
the door and told reddy to go to the
store around the corner and get a big
turkey and all the trimmings

 when i reached the fourth floor
where the kellys lived in the rear i
listened no sound came from within
and but the tiniest chink of light shown
beneath the second door which i knew
opened directly upon the kitchen and
living room johnny slept there for
it kept him near the big stove which
supplied all the heat for the diminutive
flat

  on tip-toe i moved to the other door
the one to the narrow inner hallway i
turned the knob gently entered without
sound and closed it behind me the
place was fearsomely still but as 
listened i caught the faint regular
breathing of a child johnny was asleep
i moved to the doorway of the kitchen
a lamp burned upon a table placed so
that its rays fell upon the boys bed
probably to give him courage to remain
alone while his mother was absent upon
her errand of mercy

 then my eyes wandered about and
across the shadows to the stove and

the old mantel behind it a lump came
into my throat as i noted the little
stocking hanging there johnnys stock-
ing waiting to be filled by santa claus

  poor little laddie and i had almost
 forgotten him no santa would come
 to the kelly flat but there would be
 gifts aplenty-more than johnny possi-
 bly could have dreamed of possessing

   no need to wait for the return of mrs
 kelly reddy and i would bring the
 gifts and leave them johnny was too
 sound asleep to awaken and we would
 move quietly

  i was about to turn back into the
 hallway when suddenly with a gasp of
 fright johnny sat straight up in bed and
 stared before him toward the stove witt
 wide eyes his mouth agape

 t turned and looked where he was
 i gazing and my whole body went
 numb and i leaned against the casement
 half dazed at what i saw

  for standing atop the stove-stood
 santa claus-as i had seen him pictured
 -thousands of times-smiling eyes shin-
 ing a wide belt holding his fur trimmed
 jacket close to his fat round stomach
 and high boots coining far up over his
 short legs only his pack of toys was
 missing

  but as i gazed as speechless as
 johnny the feeling of fear slipped from
 me then i noted that the figure ap-
 peared shadowy in some indescribable
 way-unlike the body of a person one
 could reach out and touch

  and his features-somehow they ap-
 peared familiar there was something
 about the look in his eyes his jolly grin
 his long flowing white whiskers which
 i seemed to remember

  merry christmas johnny merry
 christmas i the voice seemed to
 crackle with good nature and merriment

  merry chr- johnnys greeting

 died away in an awed whisper

  come come johnny youre not
 afraid of santa claus are you

  n-no sir the lads tone was more
 confident

   thats better i see you expected me
 and hung up your stocking here his
 rolling chuckle brought a grin to the
 boys face

  now johnny tell me have you
 been a good boy all year

  i-i guess so mother says so

  thats fine then he winked
 mothers always know dont they

  johnny nodded solemnly

  and since youve been a good boy
 i suppose you expect a lot of presents

  no sir not this year

  a momentary shadow flitted across
 the old fellows face lie hopped from
 the stove stepped to johnnys bed and
 leaned over familiarly resting his el-
 bows upon the footboard

  do you mean you dont expect pres-
 ents because i havent my pack with
 me

  no sir not zactly but-

  of course not you wouldnt expect
 santa claus to show little boys what
 hes going to leave for them now would
 you 

   johnny hesitated as if lost for words
 then i-i guess i dont know-quite
 -mister but mothers been sick a
 whole lot and she said when theres

 sickness you dont leave much until
 theyre well again-

ait a minute johnny the old
fellow raised a hand that trem-
bled and he held it before his eyes
listen my boy mothers are right-
almost always but-well never mind
now heres a secret just between you
and me im going to surprise mother
this time im going to make it a real
merry christmas for you both

  oh good

 yes johnny theres going to be
toys for you heaps of them-and new
clothes and candy and a big dinner with
turkey and red cranberry jelly and-

  gee 

 and listen-stoop closer theres
going to be a new coat for mother-a
long warm one with a big fur collar
and-a big surprise for you both

  the lad was astonished into complete
silence

  but johnny santa claus cant leave
things while little bovs are awake you
must close your eyes tight and go to
sleep then all the fine presents will
be left-

  and we can have them in the morn-
ing

 you surely can and if youre a
good boy next year therell be more
presents now good night and a merry
christmas

  with a flash like that of a darting
shadow the little man hopped to the
stove then to the mantel-and disap-
peared into nothingness

  but as he disappeared there came a
crash-one which startled me and
brought a cry from johnny crouching in
his bed his eyes wide staring after his
departed visitor then lie dropped back
upon his pillow his tiny mouth held in
a smile as his lids closed and he again
drifted into slumberland

  however the crash meant more to me
than it had to the boy too excited be-
cause of his talk with santa claus to
pay more than passing heed to other
things waiting only until i noted his
regular breathing i tip-toed to the stove
beside it lay a little pile of glass caused
by a vase from the mantel having fallen
and broken

 but it was the appearance of the
mantel which caught and held me a
piece of the top fully a foot in length
had dropped and was hanging i stepped
closer the piece was held by a hinge
cunningly set into the wall and the
exposed top of the upright showed an
opening i plunged my hand into it-
drew out a small tin box this i car-
ried nearer the light it was unlocked
i raised the lid-exposing a heap of
coins mostly gold in a flash the truth
came to me the hidden cache of
treasure finally was exposed instantly
i determined it should be added to the
christmas gifts of bridget and johnny

 and as i turned away to go below
and tell reddy and jim to bring the
presents i had brought i knew beyond
all question that the santa claus i had
seen was the phantom of archer hunt-
ington-that it was archer huntingtons
christmas ghosl who had touched the
spring that had uncovered the long hid-
den treasure-to gladden the heart of
little johnny kelly

stars at the time of your birth has a tre-
mendous influence upon your life

relation to your future

to the sagittarian vibrations-just as
your radio responds to the wave-length
vibrations to which it is attuned your
star of destiny then is the great
jupiter-the most powerful and benev-
olent of all the planets

  december should be a happy month

your worries and anxieties because you
will be less inclined than usual to brood
over them your intuition and fore-
sight-qualities which are characteristic
of all sagittarians-will be especially
keen i would advise you strongly to
respond as fully to this good influence
as you can it will make you feel
happier and more contented than you
have been for some time

  remember it is quite possible that
you may fall desperately in love and
you might even meet that most elusive
person-your affinity i hope you will
think of this seriously

  if you are single it is a good time
for you to marry because venus and
jupiter are the planets of love and
success if you are married this should
he a period of domestic happiness and
general prosperity for venus has much
to do with finance as well as with the
emotions and affections it is quite
lucky that this happens to lie the case

advantage of every opportunity that
presents itself this is a favorable
time to undertake new enterprises with
the pleasant assurance that all will be

well for venus and jupiter are both

mas with contentment and love for
others and you will find that prosperity
will be yours

can the spirits

photographer lias nothing to do with
these tilings until the time pictures are
to be taken the committee in charge
does all the preliminary work

 -the	picture of a dead man must
appear on the picture

 -it	must look like the dead man
but be different from any picture taken
of him while he was alive

  accordingly the following steps were
pursued

  mr robert thomas hardy mr w h
van der weyde a well-known new york
photographer and myself went to wil-
loughbys photography shop on west
thirty-second street and purchased a
set of camera plates sealed in their
original package

  across the seal of these plates wc
wrote our names so that any disturb-
ance of that paper would be instantly
manifest in the broken pencil lines

  these plates remained in my posses-
sion under lock and key until the night
of the seance

  an interesting group of people were
gathered in the laboratory of dr bowers
on west end avenue on the night which
gave birth to this astonishing and baf-
fling mystery present in the room as
guests of dr bowers were major and
mrs scott major ramus mr geiger
mr hardy miss eleanor ramos a
novelist of distinction her sister miss
marie haviland a trained nurse miss
ashtield mr v adolphe roberts a
poet mr van der weyde and his
camera and myself

the astonishing proposal by means
oi which we meant to obtain if pos-
sible a spirit photograph struck the
company with surprise it was our in-
tention to hypnotize someone and send
that person into a trance deeper and
deeper upon the astral plane and then
while the spirit might be leaving the
prostrate and unconscious body mr
van der weyde would explode a flash-
light-and we would see what we would
see it was our hope that since hvslop
had ruled our first seance we might
photograph him at the second

 with great courage miss haviland
agreed to be the subject yielding herself
to the mesmeric passes and hypnotic
suggestions of dr bowers who is an
old and practiced heirophant in the hyp-
notic mysteries

  before this was done however i in-
sisted that the most rigid control be ob-
tained over the photographic apparatus
mr van der weyde as the photographer
was barred from any direct handling of
the plates which i had brought to the
meeting they were introduced into the
holders under the observation of major
scott the camera was minutely exam-
ined

  when all was in readiness the lights
were dimmed miss haviland lay down
on a couch and dr bowers standing
over her began making magic passes in
front of her eyes and down her young
form speaking softly almost inaudibly
murmuring invitations to sleep a great
sigh escaped her her eyelids fluttered

of the dead be

continued from page 

 and closed her body seemed to grow
 rigid-then suddenly out of her mouth
 issued a stream of jargon in strange gut-
 tural intonations with fugitive snatches
 of some wild and barbaric melody

  she s talking roumanian cried
 one

   no no cried another excitedly
 its a gypsy dialect spoken in the south
 of spain

 before the matter could be decided
 the jargon ceased the girl lay ut-
 terly still and dr bowers lifted his
 hand and whispered to her

   you will not be startled at anything
 that happens

   he lowered his hand which was the
 signal to mr van dcr weyde the room
 was rocked with an explosion of the
 flashlight cartridge and a great plume
 of white smoke curled toward the ceil-
 ing as if it were itself a ghost

   not an eyelid of the entranced girl
 fluttered nor was her pulse accelerated
 by so- much as a fraction she lay ap-
 parently dead to the world dr bowers
 slowly withdrew the influence which had
 seemed to paralyze her and she woke
 up dazed but otherwise undisturbed

  there were other experiments that
 evening miss ramos was hypnotized
 and while in a trance cried out some
 exceedingly dramatic accusations it
 this were a story of hypnosis the ex-
 periences of miss ramos would require
 columns of description but i have time
 to tel only of this amazing spirit por-
 trait it was the picture taken of miss
 haviland at the moment when she was
 deepest in her slumber that produced this
 uncanny phenomenon

   the plates remained that night in the
 possession of major scott the next
 morning they were developed under his
 supervision so apparently every avenue
 of fraud was closed and barred every
 precaution taken to prevent trickery or
 practical jest all the rigid conditions
 demanded by skeptics thoroughly im-
 posed-yet the first print that came out
 of that dark room contained upon its
 surface a face that did not belong there
 a face that had not been visible to our
 naked eyes the staring bearded unmis-
 takable countenance of the old columbia
 professor who gave his life to a pursuit
 of phantoms and who died unsatisfied-
 the face of the man who proclaimed him-
 self through that rapping table the face
 of james h hyslop

 and there you have it what is the
  solution of such a mystery

   when we showed that picture to dr
 walter franklin prince at that time
 principal research officer of the american
 society for psychic research he iden-
 tified it as hyslops face no man in
 the world is more familiar with fraud as
 practiced in spirit photography than he
 all the old tricks he has been able to
 detect but here was one which lie
 could not explain

   if said he this is a fraud then it
 is most excellent most adroit none of
 the old tricks has been employed here

photographed

and if it is a real spirit picture it i
the kind of picture that i should think a
spirit would really make when you
hold your next meeting i want to be
there and observe your work

  perhaps dr prince would be able to
find the one clue that had hitherto
escaped us all but in this connection
let me point out that the one great test
which sir arthur conan doyle declares
is the true touchstone to truth in such
manifestations is here apparently met

  in one of his letters to me sir arthur
said 

  it is when you get pictures of the
dead which look like them but of which
 such picture actually exists in the
world that you have a genuine spirit
picture

  so far as we had been able to find 
such picture of hyslop as we found on
this plate had ever been known to exist

  i am an old hand at this game i have
put fraudulent mediums behind the bar
i have attended hundreds of seances

 when the newspaper reporters asked
me what i thought of this picture i re-
plied that i was certain it was a fraud
and this charge appeared in the news-
papers the next day

this was a serious accusation it
seemed to imply that someone had a
guilty knowledge i was willing to ad-
mit that it was the most amazing spirit
picture mystery of which i have ever
heard but  announced that i should
make it my business to find out the truth
of this matter and within six months i
should either expose the trick or become
a convert to genuine spirit photograph 

  within three months i gave the follow-
ing statement to the public

  it will be recalled that in connection
with the celebrated affair of the spirit
portrait which set the press and public
by the ears last summer i stated that
the entire affair was a hoax and should
not be taken seriously

  the time has come for me to speak
again about this remarkable mystery i
shall do so with all frankness fearlessly
with a full readiness to accept any con-
sequences that is the object of this
present statement

  these pictures created the greatest
astonishment all over the world the
daily press was full of exclamations of
wonder real spirit photographs seemed
at last to have been produced under
conditions which could not fail to con-
vince the pictures were reproduced in
the art supplements of newspapers and
magazines and the known tacts were
stated fairly and without exaggeration

  but at the time i said if you ask
me what i think of this picture i say to
you that i am certain it is a fraud

  i have not yet become a convert to
spirit photography nor have i given
up in despair instead i have made a
most astounding discovery

 in the last two weeks i have un
earthed certain facts which throw an
amazing if not a sinister light upon
this entire case i am now able to
state on definite authority that these so-


ghost stories

callcd spirit pictures were absolute
frauds  they were trick pictures-utter
fakes

 a rmed with the discoveries which
i made i went to the photographer
mr van der weyde and faced him with
the facts

 he smiled without embarrassment
and said mr frikell i congratulate
you you are right the pictures were
frauds i made them myself i hood-
winked you all under your very eyes 

  why did you do it i demanded

   because i had something to prove-
and i proved it he declared i am an
absolute skeptic about all such matters
i do not believe there is such a thing as
a genuine spirit photograph in existence
they are all frauds i wanted to prove
that i could make a spirit photograph
under the test conditions which sir
arthur conan doyle laid down i did
it i deceived america with my spirit
face of hyslop i could do it again
no one can detect my method 

  i will detect it i told him

  i will pay one hundred dollars to
you the day that you do he replied

  there you have mr van der weydes
statement and there you have his chal-
lenge

  i have not yet discovered how he pro-
duced the spirit photographs but twenty
years in magic and spiritualism have
taught me a great deal i believe i can
solve this mystery and if i do i am
going to claim that one hundred dollars

  in the interests of justice i am giv-
ing this statement to the public the
doubt which i cast upon the authenticity
of those spirit photos-a doubt which
opened me to the danger of a personal
prosecution for libel-is now justified by
the man whom i indirectly accused

  i am going to find the secret of that
trick and when i do find it i am go-
ing to tell the public how it was done

the above statement published under
my signature created the greatest
amount cf interest hundreds of people
wrote me asking how the picture was
made

  i am now ready to tell the complete
truth of the whole amazing episode

  as a matter of fact the secret of this
astounding mystery was simplicity itself
and any magician will tell you that his
best tricks are the simplest

 what mr van der weyde did was
this

  in his possession was a photograph of
hyslop which he had made years ago
hyslop vlid not like the picture and re-
fused to buy it and so the plate remained
in mr van der weydes files and no one
but ilyslop and himself had ever seen it
or knew that it existed this was the
plate he used in perpetrating the spirit
hoax

  he then went to a well-known supply
house in new york and purchased a set
of plates with the utmost care he
steamed the pasted sides of the package
and opened it without destroying any of
the paper container or mutilating it in
any fashion

  taking the top plate he exposed upon
it the portrait of professor hyslop he
then carefully replaced the plate in its
original wrapper and restored it appar-

ently intact the box was then sealed
and when the job was done the most
expert packer in the eastman kodak
companys plant would have been jus-
tified in taking oath to the fact that the
package had not been disturbed

 the price was then marked on the
bottom of the container this was done
to identify it as the price is never
marked on packages of this kind

it was then taken back to the supply
shop and mr van der weyde gravely
took one of the young clerks aside and
put the package in his hands

  now said he when i come in here
with two gentlemen and ask you for
two plates you give me this package

  the answer to the whole riddle is that
the clerk did give him this package and
thereafter all efforts made to prevent
trickery being brought to bear upon the
plates were absolutely futile because the
trick was done before the plates were
ever sent to the group

  please note the following letter which
i received from mr van der weyde

  your explanation is entirely correct
i enclose you herewith my check for


  and there you have it

 sir arthur conan doyle said there
were three points that must be present
in a genuine spirit photograph

  -the	picture must be that of a per-
son who is dead

  -it	must be different from any pic-
ture known to have been taken of that
person while that person was alive

  -it	must be taken under absolutely
scientific test conditions

 all these points were met and an-
swered in this picture

  it did look like professor hyslop and
was identified it was different from any
photograph known to have been taken of
him while he was alive the photograph
was made under actual test conditions

  and yet the picture was a fake

  the value of all this hoodwinkery of
course lay in convincing the public that
no matter how carefully the rules may
be laid down as doyle had laid them
down a clever man will find a way to
evade them

  but shortly thereafter i was in for
some hoodwinkery myself

  i had journeyed to chicago to attend
a scientific convention and while there
made the acquaintance of an elderly lady
who was deeply convinced of the actu-
ality of spirit photographs

 no matter who else you may have
found to be a fake she told me doc-
tor rushmore is not a fake

 and who i dared to ask is dr
rushmore 

  he is a physician she explained
living out on the border of the city
who has discovered in himself the mystic
power of mediumship

  really i asked skeptically

  yes

  can i bring my own plates

  certainly and she told me the kind
to get we had made an appointment
to call on the doctor that same evening
i went out and found a photograph shop
i was all alone and i satisfied myself
that i was not followed then i pur-
chased a packct of films-not the kind i
had been instructed to get but another

kind of the same size with these but-
toned inside of my vest i repaired to
the home of the miracle worker

 he was a very ordinary appearing
man who was something of a joke to
his wife a lady cursed with a most
caustic sense of humor he himself was
good-natured if a bit taciturn and re-
served-a serious pondering man slen-
der tall bald-headed and peering keen-
ly from behind his nose glasses as if he
saw things back of you that were invis-
ible to you

  my studio is down in the basement
he explained and led us down the stairs
into a plainly furnished place there
was a small camera set on rollers fac-
ing a hanging drop at the back and be-
yond that a door that led into the dark
room

  i loaded the film pack into his camera
watching carefully that they were not
exchanged

  i helped focus the camera

  i posed for several of the pictures and
the woman who had brought me there
posed for the others

  i removed the films from the camera
and carried them into the dark room

  i developed the films

  i printed the pictures

  we were there for half the night while
all this was being accomplished the
result was that on one of the plates we
could see the portrait of a beautiful
young girl above the head of the woman
who was with me

  here indeed was a mystery

in vain i tried to remember every step
of the way in order to find the trick
i knew there was a trick to it but
where had the doctor ferreted the
films out of my possession without my
knowing it double exposed them and
tricked me under my very nose i am
a good sleight-of-hand performer myself
and i didnt like to think i could be so
easily duped i thought of the weirdest
explanations i fancied a beam of light
playing from a concealed stereopticon
on to the lens of the camera i fancied
radioactive disks concealed in the hand
of the performer as he passed them over
the lens i tried every possible hypoth-
esis but i still could not explain it

  yet i was convinced it was not gen-
uine spiritualism i was convinced that
some jugglery too subtle for my eyes
was responsible for this astonishing re-
sult

  at last i came upon the solution if
it is disappointing to the reader that i
cannot disclose it here i am deeply
sorry but i try to be fair in dealing
with spirit mediums no matter how i
may suspect them i cannot swear that
my hypothesis is correct i merely as-
sert that i have found a simple an ex-
ceedingly simple hypothesis which does
fit the facts and by which i can dupli-
cate the surprising portraits made in
doctor rushmores studio and i chal-
lenge doctor rushmore to give me an-
other sitting if i cannot detect him i
shall publicly announce my defeat but
if i do detect him he is to admit pub-
licly that i have found him out this
is a clear cut challenge and i shall be
glad to know what he has to say about it

  meanwhile since that time i have come
upon a number of other interesting spirit-
ghost stories



 photograph mysteries that are well
 worthy of study there is for instance
 the problem of the moving picture of
 von sclirenk nortzing

 a few months ago while the present
 writer was in paris he met with a
 journalist who was interested in the ex-
 periments then being conducted in a
 scientific laboratory tliere-the chambre
 metaphysique i think it was called

   they have spirit moving pictures
 lie told me

   i smiled

   some marvelous fake spirit pictures
 have been made i remarked some
 years ago there was a serial shown in
 some of the largest picture theaters in
 america it was called the mysteries
 of mvra and i think hereward carring-
 ton was one of the authors of the story
 in the mysteries of myra there were
 ghosts all over the screen but it was
 just fake photography-admittedly so

   this is not a fake said the parisian
 journalist positively these are mov-
 ing pictures taken in seance chambers-
 reels of materializing spirits issuing from
 the side of the medium in the form of
 milk-white ectoplasm

   for  gods sake let me see them i
 pleaded

   forthwith this promising young jour-
 nalist agreed to meet me for dinner at
 gauclairs that same evening stating
 that he would conduct me after the
 meal to a private showing of some of
 these extraordinary films i would like
 to include here a full description of the
 pictures-with their ghosts and their
 mediums and all the rest of it but
 alas i must keep silent for the good and
 simple reason that i never caught sight
 of my parisian journalist again he
 vanished over one of the bridges never
 again to reappear-and my frantic in-
 quiries helped me not at all for no one
 else could be found who would admit
 that lie had ever heard of the chambre
 metaphysique

   however that started my mind think-
 ing of spirit moving pictures and 
 turned to one of the greatest authorities
 in the world  the subject-an austrian
 scientist with the wholly extraordinary
 name of baron von sclirenk nortzing

   all over the world the baron is held
 in the deepest respect by scientists he
 is a man of the highest attainments his
 word is unquestioned he is a man who
 may be thoroughly believed even though
 his observations like everyones else
 may occasionally be mistaken

 now the baron has written ah im-
 mense book in which lie details hun-
 dreds of experiments with spirit me-
 diums illustrated with scores of photo-
 graphs taken of trance sittings in which
 ectoplasm-a sticky substance which is-
 sues from the mouth ears or nose of
 the medium and forms itself into ghosts
 -is shown by flash-light and by time
 exposure

   i wondered if there were moving pic-
 tures mentioned in von sclirenk nort-
 zings book and hurried to find out

   there were

   under the strictest control according
 to the royal scientist these photographs
 had been made and the strips of cellu-
 loid film showed the ectoplasm flowing

ghost stories

from the mouth of the medium and
forming itself into the shape of a human
hand	

 these experiments were conducted
with a polish woman and the account
the baron gives of the affair in his book
-which by the way is called phenom-
ena of materialization-with the de-
tails of the location of the camera and
the medium the illumination of the room
and other essentials is very convincing

  reading his story and looking at his
reproductions of this film one is apt to
be convinced

  i then remembered that houdini had
had a seance with one of the barons
mediums and had found nothing to sub-
stantiate the sensational claims made in
her behalf i knew that houdini was
not only the worlds handcuff king and
champion medium exposer but that also
he was one of the worlds most expert
magicians and could detect trickery at a
glance

  accordingly one evening i went to the
national theater on broadway and
found him in his dressing room suffer-
ing from a broken leg but still gamely
determined to give his performance

 under my arm was the barons bulky
book of spirit seances and pictures

  houdini i said do you know this
book

  he smiled sadly

  i know it well he replied

 what about the moving pictures in
it i asked

 what about the whole book he
flared

  you tell me i requested

  this is what he told me

  i say the von schrenk nortzing book
is filled with a lot of piffle and the pic-
tures are ridiculous to the nth degree
either he is being duped or there is
somebody in his household making a fool

of him in my seance with eva the
medium about whom the baron wrote
the bulk of his huge volume at no time
did she display any evidence of being
able to produce ectoplasm regarding
the moving picture of what took place
with the present scientific methods of
taking moving pictures in a dark room
i can double-discount them men like
von schrenk nortzing are never initi-
ated

  here houdini paused and chuckled

  you know he said quizzically if
the baron and i were put together nailed
in a box and thrown overboard i am
the only one who would come up alive
that is because i know how these things
are done and the baron doesnt a
knowledge of magic-of conjuring and
sleight-of-hand-is necessary to detect
mediums-just as a knowledge of anat-
omy is necessary to a surgeon

  ow it may very well be objected
that such a denunciation as that
does not disprove the case against the
many reports of spirit moving pictures
emanating from europe as reported in
the newspapers nor indeed the very
pictures in the barons monumental
volume

  the point is however that the ex-
perience of houdini the most famous
magician in america today if not in the
world and of every other trained magi-
cian has demonstrated that all the me-
diums of famous scientists turn out to
be fakers when they are investigated by
a man who knows conjuring tricks

  one of the most recent cases is the
famous margery case in boston where
a distinguished committee of scientists
was ready to declare that the manifes-
tations they had seen were genuine un-
til houdini came along and prickcd the
bubble by discovering the trick

  another celebrated case was that of
ada bessinet of toledo ohio two
books were written about bessinet by a
columbia professor who declared she
was one of the greatest mediums in the
world sir arthur conan doyle held a
seance with her and conversed with the
specter of his dead son then a mac-
fadden publications writer who was also
a magician went to toledo sat with
bessinet and published an expose of her
tricks showing that it was all done by
cleverness instead of spirits

the same investigator exposed the

two mediums who were declared gen-
uine by w t stead the noted english
investigator and later convicted in the
police courts two associate ministers of
the first spiritualist church of new
york for one of the most astounding
ghost hoaxes ever offered to the dupes
at three dollars a ghost

 wherever a magician comes in con-
tact with a medium the trick is shown
up houdini has exposed hundreds of
them and when houdini says that the
spirit moving pictures are piffle it is not
hard to believe him

  the candid opinion of this wrjter is
that we will wait a long time before we
have five reel pictures of actual spirits
-and in the meantime we can get along
very nicely with gloria dorothy and
lillian charlie and richard and the
other glorious living

  the screen is no place for dead ones
anyway

 meanwhile should you ask me if
spirit photography is ever genuine i can
only shrug my shoulders and ask
you-

  when is anything ever wholly gen-
uine

  it is a matter to speculate over-some-
thing for us to think about

tlextl -idithin four creeping idalls

                               continued from page 

know gave me capris book but i
havent read it im not interested in
that sort of stuff i cant explain why i
went with you to his lecture except
that tonight i felt a bit fidgetty

  this is my idea of a restful room
said -walters as he picked up his hat
and coat sometimes i positively envy
you having this room old man

  you do eh answered tempest with
a complacent grin well my dear wal-
ters youll have to be content with up-
stairs this tenant has no intention of
moving out i assure you

  i suppose not said walters drily
he paused at the door to add jestingly
watch out you dont fall into capris
depression

 not much tempest assured him
upon my word walters if you stick
up for that learned ass ill have to give
you up as a bad job leave ghosts alone
and stick to your briefs good night
old man ill have a pipe and turn in
walters opened the door and peered
ahead of him dubiously seeming to hesi-
tate then he stepped gingerly out and
closed the door behind him

 for a moment tempest stood staring

at the door through which his friend
had passed a thoughtful expression on
his rugged features then he turned
slowly

 whats the world coming to a
sane normal fellow like walters he
said aloud

  he walked to the table and leisurely
filled his pipe

  hallucinations george i hope he
wont end by traveling on-by his own
hand obstinate fellow hes quite
capable of doing it though to prove his
point to me ah there he is now pok-
ing his fire upstairs damn kind of him
to remind me of the fellow who did for
himself over there eh-half in half
out of this room lucky for me i
havent much imagination lots of peo-
ple would begin to imagine all sorts of
things    ive half a mind to launch
a counterblast at old capri-write some-
thing to show him up for the self opin-
ionated ass he is wheres his book

  he went to the line of bookcases still
muttering to himself

  here we are a study of suicide by
luigi capri three hundred pages
good lord ill have a look at this

anyway there may be something in it

  he settled himself in the armchair

  the power of suggestion prospec-
tive suicides brain like that of pros-
pective murderer is peculiarly receptive
to imitative impulse this may be awak-
ened in several ways for instance
reading account of a suicide by a co-
incidence in circumstances-fellow in
trouble let us say reads of the suicide
of another in similar trouble attrac-
tion too which certain heights-bridges
for instance-have for suicides a sui-
cide committed from one of the bridges
of paris is sure to be followed by an-
other at no remote interval-just as one
atrocious form of murder is sure to have
its imitators

  another cause more occult- 

he snorted contemptuously occult fid-
dlesticks 

  he read on is it not possible i
ask you that even as the scene of a
crime arouses in the subconscious in-
telligence of one visiting it an involun-
tary shrinking a quiver of horror so
may not the atmosphere of the scene
of a suicide still be attainted by and
impregnated with the horrid impulse or
c host stories

premeditated callousness with which the
suicide took his life indeed i go fur-
ther i suggest that the soul of the
wretched taker of his own life chained
to the spot by the elemental passion of
self-destruction may linger there wait-
ing until another by his own wilful
deed supplants him in possession of the
accursed spot 

  tempest closed the book with a slam
and threw it on the table

  theres madness for you my god
what an idea death like a barber-
yes looking from the victim in the chair
to some other poor devil and politely
saying next damn it the mans a
lunatic yet-he finds an audience
theres walters now-that model of
precision and cold logic-ready to meet
capris theories halfway

hf sat staring at the fire then laid
down his pipe with an impatient
gesture and rose to his feet bor a
minute or so he paced up and down the
room

  restless i wonder what makes me
so restless hope i get a better sleep
tonight those damned dreams -all
night long-yet i cant remember them

 wake up tired as a dog

  he halted in front of his bookcases

 books books ghosts of dead
mens thoughts theres your real
ghosts for you im sick of them sick
of them ill sell the whole lot lqrd
what a lot of my life ive wasted with
my nose in a book men of my age
have done things-seen things ive al-
ways wanted to go to africa india

  im only forty-five if i had my life
to live over again id do something dif-
ferent from what ive done-drowsing
along reading-a little writing that
meant nothing-collecting coins when i
die all that the papers will be able to say
about me will bemr john tempest
the numismatist was a well known figure
at auctions his collection which in-
cludes many rare specimens is willed 
to the museum short and sweet the
obituary of a nobody

  he glanced up at the cciling

  theres walters knocking his pipe
out on his way to the bench-judge
walters oh well he deserves it he
works day and night hell have the
power of life and death in his hands
lifes a problem that even death wont
solve

  he wheeled around sharply with a
shudder

  thats queer what made me say
that almost as if-as if someone had
prompted me-like a voice at my car

  for a moment he stood still a puzzled
startled expression stamped on his face
then his rigid posture relaxed and he
shook his shoulders

 pshaw that talk of walters
what the devil did he mean by remind-
ing me i was living in a suicides room
ton my word i can believe hes so set
on having this place that hed not stop
at trying to scare me he laughed soft-
ly scare me me	

  he resumed his pacing and his mut-
tered musing

  no reason eh the poor devil must
have had a reason twenty-five they
said he was-and to kill himself ugh

i wonder-thinking-too much thinking

about himself-then all at once the
poison-a moment and then-nothing
oblivion at twenty-five preposterous
at forty-five maybe-but twenty-five
rubbish a fellow with imagination
cotdd make quite a story of the busi
ness if anyone wanted to read it

  he looked about him slowly

   funny i used to think this was
a cheerful room hut now-god-its
gloomy all this dark woodwork the
house is too old-too cluttered with

memories with tragedy that-

  he stopped short with a start listened
then going to the door opened it and
looked out

  that you briggs

  there was no answer from the shadowy
corridor he stood with a perplexed
expression then shut the door quickly

  queer sounded like some one walk-
ing up and down out there

he stood by the door listening then
returned to the fire staring at the
mantelpiece as though enumerating the
objects on it-the clock the two bronze
elephants the vial of blue glass with its
poison label

  quite simple nothing simpler-if i
wer such a fool an accident looks
just like that stuff tallifer gave me old
fool-as if i needed any of his antiquated
prescriptions a bit tired-thats all
thats the matter with me

  he held the bottle in his hand for an
instant then set it back on the mantel
shelf

 no- he looked round quickly

why should i just came into my
mind queer how you get ideas just
came into my mind-how easy john
tempest my boy youve got to get out
more in the open air soon youll be
as bad as walters with his hallucina-
tions his voice dropped to a hushed
whisper in my ear-like a whisper-

someone whispering- here this

wont do it wont

  he clenched his fist-struck the mantel
a blow

  my coins sell them-and go on a
trip algiers it will be a wrench but
ill do it go and see the curator of
the museum tomorrow and see what
hell give me if he cant meet my price
ill sell them at auction moran would
give his eye teeth for my gold stater
for a moment he seemed transformed
with a brisk air he went to the cabinet
and pulling out a tray of coins carried
it over and set it on the table he
looked them over critically a glow of
enthusiasm in his eyes

  let me see let me see these silver
ones need a little rubbing up

  he poured some of the contents of the
bottle he had taken from the mantel
shelf into a saucer then sitting down
he began to polish one of the coins with
a rag

  that gold stater ought to go high i
spent five hundred  it-worth six
times that now-good specimen as clean
as when it came from the mint the
desert i might go so far as to hire
a caravan that woman-rosita some-
thing-got pretty far into the desert
plucky woman- can surely do the
same wasted my life no love no
tame no pleasure no friends but old
fogies-except walters-judge walters

eh hell be surprised wont he gcd
forty-five thirty lost years even a-
a boy that old aunt of mine and her
tight reins its a wonder i didnt lose
my mind its a wonder-

  he paused uncertainly with a sudden
searching stare at the curtains of the
archway

  eh-did these curtains always hang
that way-out at the foot-as if there
was something there-lying-

  he laid down the rag abruptly and
put his hand up to feel his brow he
half rose from his seat his eyes still
upon the curtains then he sat down
again and drawing his handkerchief
wiped his forehead

  im cold he muttered funny-
brows wet-cold

he leaned forward and poked the dy-
ing coals coaxing them into a blaze
and at the sound walters overhead
looked up from his papers listened a
moment smiled and resumed his read-
ing

  in the room below into which a
stealthy silence was creeping broken
only by the heavy breathing of the man
who stared into the fire-nothing stirred

  then all at once moved by a draft
coming from some unsuspected crevice
the flame leapt up there was a rustling
behind him and john tempest roused
from a strange lethargy sat up swiftly
and looked at the one place in the room
where he knew he must look

  the curtains of the archway were
strained tight-pulled together as though
some unseen hand held them

  for an instant tempest sat as though
stupified then with shaking hands he
reached for the decanter and poured out
a stiff drink he carried it to his lips
tossed it down and hurriedly poured out
another which he set upon the table a
cunning look crept into his eyes and he
nodded his head

  scare me he exclaimed hoarsely
scare me with votir ghosts friend wal-
ters-scare me out of my room eh
come out-out with you let me see
you eh-you wont all right stay
where yon are

  he resumed his polishing his fore-
head wrinkled with the effort at con-
centration

  all at once he laid down the rag

  supposing i cant sell them easy
to buy but when you come to sell-you
sell for a song on and on-year after
year-those lost years of my youth
im too old to begin again

  he looked once more at the curtains

  i wonder he said softly i wonder
what you thought of it all you had
a problem-you had-what answer did
you get  eh 

  he bent forward as though to catch
the reply

  whispering what are you whis-
pering about he scowled impatiently
what is it i cant hear you the
room is full of whispering-whisperinc
voices

  he rose to his feet and shook his fist
at the curtains as he did so his jaw
dropped and he recoiled for a second
or two of pulsating time he stood-his
face a livid mask of horror as though
that which he feared was lurking behind
the swaying curtains had suddenly been


ghost stories

revealed to him then with groping
hands he reached out for the glass of
whisky it was half way to his lips
when he stopped and put out his hand
to the vial which stood uncorked upon
the table a swift tilting of its contents
into the glass and smiling strangely
john tempest lifted the glass once more
to his lips

charles walters laid his papers

down and leaped to his feet some-
thing had fallen heavily in the room be-
neath for a moment he listened care-
fully all was silent below then ap-
prehension assailed him and he ran to
his door

 he came downstairs two steps at a
time and knocked at tempests door
there was no answer he turned the
knob and stepped inside

 anything wrong heard a thud
anything-

  with horror-stricken eyes he gazed

down at the body of tempest it was
lying in the archway half concealed by
the trailing curtains

tempest what  earth my
god he cried in horrified tones

 he bent over the body and picked up
 the glass he sniffed it

good god

 kneeling he laid his hand on the dead
 mans heart then over his mouth he
 rose to his feet a look of utter perplex-
 ity on his face

 why no earthly reason 

 walters stood there looking down at
 the body intently for some little time
 he seemed to be trying to decide some-
 thing in his mind then he raised his
 head and stared about him into his
 face there crept a look of appreciation
 of eager anticipation

i could place my desk-

he checked himself with a shocked
and self-accusing gesture

 poor tempest he said softly in a

 contrite tone im sorry that it had to
 be he studied a moment id better
 phone the police

he walked to the desk in the corner
and sat down-almost with a pro-
prietary air after all it seemed good
to be there he smiled a pleased smile
he had always liked these rooms and

now that-

  walter did not notice that in the door-
way which he had left open someone
stood pointing at him-pointing at him
malignantly had he had eyes to see
he might have distinguished a staring
white face-but it was not the face of
young halliwell no it was an older
face-the face of him who had been
john tempest and his stubby forefinger
was raised-as though to say to the
tenant who would now occupy those
rooms who had kept constantly saying
that he would like to occupy those rooms
next

out of a qleaminq tomb

                    continued from page 

 didnt care a hoot about the pictures
but i was in hopes of seeing ruth again
for perhaps an hour we sat there thumb-
ing over photographs and talking gen-
eralities and i saw that the old boy
had taken a fancy to me several times
i made a move to go but each time he
brought out something else to show me
or opened some new topic of conversa-
tion and i could see he wanted me to
stay that he was enjoying my company
finally the door opened and ruth came
in the same inscrutable expression in
her eyes

  ruth meet mr evans my daughter
sir miss higgins

 miss higgins then she hadnt mar-
ried i jumped to my feet and went to
meet her with outstretched hand too

happy to hide my joy why perhaps-

  but aside from the slight deepening
of her color she gave no sign that she
noticed and replied quite calmly

  mr-evans-and i have already met
why of course of course you let
him in didnt you now i was just
going to ask him to stay and have sup-
per with us but perhaps youd better do
it instead its the women-folks plaee
to do the invitin isnt it and he
laughed jovially

  im sure well be delighted if mr
evans will stay she smiled at me
now little imps of mischief dancing be-
hind her eyes so she had noted my
confusion-thought i was some city guy
who had fallen in love with her  sight
well that was all right too id woo
her first and then tell her who i was

mrs higgins joined us presently and
we sat long over the pleasant meal
i found myself talking as i hadnt talked
in months under the skillful questioning
of ruth and the appreciative attention
of the old folks my life had indeed
been colorful-more so than i had real-
ized i discovered-and i sat there tell-
ing them tales of foreign lands and
strange adventures until the late summer
sun went down and the lights had to be

turned on it brought back old memories

  that seemed to break the spell and as
we left the room to allow the maid of
all work to clear the table mrs higgins
suggested tactfully that ruth take me
out on the porch for a breath of air
same match-making mamma she had al-
ways been i told myself gaily and
thanked my stars that so far her efforts
had been in vain this time though
please god they would be successful 
we were out on the porch now stand-
ing uncertainly at the top of the steps
there was no moon but the night was
bright with a multitude of stars and the
crickets and bullfrogs were holding their
evening concert once more the mem-
ories crowded over me and for a mo-
ment i was again that boy of eighteen
she too seemed to be feeling the spell
of the evening for she stood as silently
as uncertainly as i suddenly without
in the least intending to speak i heard
my voice saying

  well ruth

  the next instant she was in my arms
sobbing and laughing all at once re-
peating my name over and over again
ralph    ralph

 when she had become coherent i
whispered you knew me then dear
of course id have known you any-
where 

 and you knew i would come back
i somehow felt that my coming back
to her had been as inevitable as the
movements of the stars

 yes  i knew you would but it

was so long-so long- again she

buried her head against my shoulder
and i held her to me hungrily a fierce
pang of remorse tugging at my heart

  fifteen years she continued but
somehow i knew you would come back
some day theres never been anyone
else ralph

  what a rotter i was i tried to tell
her but she placed her soft little hand
against my mouth and would not listen

  oh i know ralph there have been
experiences adventures-other women

i never for a moment pictured you go-
ing through life ignoring everything-
everybody but me men arent like
that but i knew love like ours couldnt
die

  and it hasnt dearest believe me-

  i know

  after awhile she suggested that we
take a walk and as we sauntered through
the old paths and haunts i told her of
my visit and what i hoped to achieve
and she told me about my father

  my going she said seemed to have
opened his eyes to many things he had
tried desperately to find me but he
could learn nothing save the fact that
i had shipped on the freighter tim-
buctoo at hong kong i had left the
ship and disappeared completely and in
time when i failed to write him he
came to fear i had been killed but he
could never quite believe that

 he had known of my love for ruth
and he and ruth had spent many hours
together talking about me and speculat-
ing about my fate time went on and
still they had no word and gradually
my father began to age to lose interest
in things he seemed to feel and right-
ly that my step-mother was responsible
for my disappearance and there were
many bitter quarrels between them

then one day my step-mother packed
her things and went back west to
her old home father continued to live
in the old house all by himself ruth
said she understood he had sent the
woman money from time to time but he
had never actually told her so

 with my step-mothers going his
habits had changed and he had become
a recluse the only people he saw at
all were doctor nevins and judge
wyckham both life-long friends he
avoided all other contacts ruth told
me that at first she had hunted him up
as usual every so often but he was
silent morose almost surly and one
day he had asked her point blank not
to come again you remind me of-
ghost stories



him lie explained  dont want to be
reminded of him

  presently it began to be noised about
that old major durham must be los-
ing his money for he was selling his
various real estate holdings about town
then certain of the fine old family fur-
niture and rugs were sold to various
antique dealers-in fact he seemed to be
turning everything of value he owned
into money

  it was commonly believed he had
gambled on the stock market or some-
thing of that sort and lost most of
what he owned two or three years be-
fore he had suddenly dropped dead of
heart failure and he was buried imme-
diately quietly without any fuss as
was his wish his two old friends doc-
tor nevins and judge wyckham took
complete charge of everything and the
widow was not notified until after the
funeral

  she arrived in town in a fine rage
why had she not been sent for before
the funeral he had not wished it
what did that matter she was his
widow wasnt she-his only surviving
relative but the two old men paid
little attention to her and at last she
calmed down and demanded that the will
be read but there seemed to be no will
and as there was no one to dispute her
right she automatically inherited what
property there was-only the house and
a small amount of money in the savings
bank

in order to live she had to rent the
house and take the stoner shack for
her own abode and the catastrophe had
been almost too much for her never
any too pleasant she had developed into
a veritable shrew and few people would
tisk association with her so there she
lived alone bitter almost an outcast
indeed some people even went so far
as to say she had become slightly de-
mented

  as ruth unfolded this story to me
my feelings can well be imagined if
only i had known how different i might
have made things for my father during
his last years i might at least have
communicated with him i told myself
wretchedly but i had been very bitter
and i had not known he cared

  you couldnt be expected to know
she said softly you mustnt blame
yourself too severely

   took her hand in mine and for
awhile we continued our walk in silence

  is he buried here i asked we
had reached the old cemetery in which
ny mother lay sleeping ruth nodded
 pushed open the gate and we entered

  i knew the spot well after mothers
death i had come there often gaining a
measure of comfort from the simple rite
of decorating her grave with flowers
and in spite of the dark i was able to
lead the way to the family plot as we
approached it i thought i saw some-
thing move and at the same instant
ruths grip on my arm tightened

  do you see someone i whispered

  ye-es she tried to answer bravely
but her voice quavered and i could feel
her body trembling as she came closer
to me

  yon wait here and ill investigate
i whispered but she clung to me in ter-

ror and at last we both advanced to-
ward the spot silently cautiously

  as we drew near i could make out
the outlines of a white figure flitting
about and for an instant all the stuff
i had ever heard about ghosts and
grave yards raced crazily through my
head then reason reasserted itself and
i managed to get myself in hand

  good lord there were no ghosts
i was acting like an idiot this was a
thing of flesh and blood and i must find
out who it was and what it was doing
here i loosened ruths terrified hold on
my arm and whispered stand right
here dont move im going to take it
by surprise and ruth too scared for
utterance did as i told her

  slowly i advanced on the thing and
suddenly spying me apparently for the
first time it turned and fled i followed
in full pursuit and finally sensing that
i was gaining on it it turned and charged
back at me and for a wild moment i
fought the impulse to run from it but
something bigger than i kept me rooted
to the spot and as it came at me i
opened my arms and caught hold of it
tightly there was a moment of fierce
struggle then it crumpled up in my arms
and lay there panting and gasping i
lowered it to the ground and quickly
struck a match at that moment ruth
came rushing up to me

  ralph youre all right oh thank
god then seeing the figure crumpled
at my feet she gave a little gasp oh
ralph-her 

  her

  your step-mother 

  so that was the ghost

i struck a fresh match and peered
at the figure more closely what i saw
filled me with both disgust and pity
it was she all right-a moth-eaten cari-
cature of her former self her whole
body had shrunk her hair was tangled
and unkempt and gray her light clothes
hung about her in tatters but the same
features were there-the beak of a nose
the cruel mouth the receding chin

  her eyes were closed and she seemed
to be unconscious as she lay there in
a huddled heap the match flickered
and went out there was a sudden
swift movement in the darkness and be-
fore we could grasp what was happen-
ing she had darted up and away i
made as though to follow her but ruth
laid a detaining hand on my arm

  let her go ralph shes harmless-
and probably scared to death

  and of course she was right why
follow the old woman i wanted noth-
ing of her apparently the gossips who
had called her slightly demented were
not so far wrong she certainly looked
and acted crazy

  i gave a slight involuntary shudder
as i turned back toward the grave and
would have left the place at once had
not something stronger than my own in-
clinations propelled my feet i found
myself in a moment or two once more
beside my fathers grave and striking a
fresh match i stooped and studied the
simple inscription on the headstone

  for a few moments i stood with bowed
head my feelings a mixture of rever-
ence and remorse while ruth waited for
me a few feet away presently i turned

giiost stories

   to join her and as i did so a midden
   icy wind passed swiftly over me at
   the same moment a shrill scream broke
   from ruth

    ralph look look she seemed
   to have taken leave of her senses as she
   stood shrieking pointing a finger at me
   -or was it over my shoulder

     swiftly i wheeled about and for a
   second my blood seemed to freeze in
   iny veins as i too saw it a shadowy
   form was rising-rising out of the earth 
   then instantly a great calm took pos-
   session of me and i found myself mov-
   ing as one in a dream

      father 

    i would have known him anywhere
   in spite of the gray hair the bent
   shoulders it seemed quite natural that
   lie should be there even though i could
   see through him even though i realized
   this thing was unearthly unbelievable-
   a mere phantom

     i took a step toward him then some-
   thing made me stop and for a moment
   we stood regarding each other as though
   we would penetrate each others very
    souls then a beautiful smile spread
    e ver his countenance and his fine eyes
   fairly poured forth love and tenderness

     father i took another step toward
   him and at that instant a strange light
   came from over my shoulder lighting
   up the figure in the weirdest manner
   and  saw a luminous glittering mass
   as though a million tiny stars were
   lodged there with a sudden swift mo-
   tion he reached inside his coat then
   i advanced toward me the luminous sub-
   stance in his outstretched hand at that
   moment the spell was broken by a cry
   from ruth and as i turned toward her
   the figure of my father began to dissolve

   for the next few moments my atten-
   tion was centered on ruth who had
   fallen to the ground in a quivering heap
   it was some time before i could calm
   her in sheer desperation i finally told
   her that she really had been mistaken
   that her nerves were badly unstrung
   that there had been no ghost no pres-
   ence save what her own fevered imagin-
   ation had pictured but when i had
   taken her home and had left her with the
   understanding that on the morrow i
   would call upon her parents and reveal
   my identity to them i found that i too
   was unnerved

     this thing was uncanny yet we had
   both seen the thing hadnt we it was
   really my father-not a doubt about
   that

      after i got into bed i lay there trying
    to figure it out surely i had been
    wrong my step-mothers presence in the
    graveyard had made us excited we had
    imagined the rest it was with this
    thought on my mind that i finally
    dropped off to sleep

     ivl i sat up in bed and peered into
   the darkness had a voice actually
   called me or was it a dream at first
   nothing was visible then i felt again
   that unearthly icy wind and heard a
   slight rustling sound

    father the word came from me
   almost unconsciously and i had no
   sooner uttered it than he stood before
   me quite bright in the darkness with

that strange glitter over his heart more
radiant more dazzling than before

  for a long moment he stood gazing at
me then slowly he raised his arm and
beckoned and like one in a dream i
arose and followed down the length
of the room he led me then as he
reached my old book-case beside the
window he seemed to vanish straight
through the wall i was left standing
in the darkness dazed baffled and
shaken	-

  what could it mean i continued to
stand there for some time in a sort of
stupor then slowly i made my way back
to the bed what did it all mean he
was evidently trying to tell me some-
thing-but what

  i must have fallen asleep again for
once more i awakened with the distinct
impression that my name had been
called yes-there he was again he
looked distressed this time and he
beckoned me more emphatically than be-
fore again i arose and followed him
to the book-case this time he pointed
at it meaningly and again he vanished
through the wall

  i felt around for the electric switch-
turned it on this thing was queer i
would get to the bottom of this i i went
over and carefully examined the old
book-case it was empty of all save a
few books relics of my school days
that no one had seen fit to remove one
by one i took them out thumbed over
their pages and shook out any loose
papers they contained nothing of im-
portance only bits of scratch paper-
notes made at school then suddenly
in a flash i remembered

  the sliding panel    how could i
have forgotten

  quickly i pulled the book-case from
the wall and groped about for the spring
yes it was still there i pressed it and
with beating heart watched for per-
haps the hundredth time the noiseless
sliding back of the panel the disclosure
of that yawning cavity beyond built
by the original owner of the house prob-
ably to lodge a safe or something of the
sort this place of concealment had al-
ways fired my youthful imagination with
its thrilling possibilities many a time
as a kid i had hidden my most cher-
ished possessions there away from pry-
ing eyes that anyone else knew of its
existence i never for a moment dreamed
but i realized now that father must have
known of it from the start

  i struck a match and thrust it inside
the opening and in the flickering light
i saw that the space was empty save for
a flat package that lay on the bottom
beneath a heavy coating of dust i lifted
this out eagerly my heart pounding with
excitement it was a thick envelope
bearing judge wyckhams name in one
corner and addressed to me in my
fathers well-known writing

  i opened it and with trembling fingers
i drew out a long legal document-my
fathers last will and testament swiftly
my eye scanned the closely written sheet
then i started at the beginning what
i read there astounded me especially
so in view of what had happened this
night

  apparently my father was determined
that my step-mother should have none
of his money he wanted me to have

it but in the event that i never re-
turned it was to just disappear from
the earth he had conceived the strange
idea of turning everything he owned into
cash and then converting that cash into
-diamonds judge wyckham who was
appointed his executor was instructed
to conceal these diamonds in a secret
inside pocket of fathers coat over his
heart just before his burial-and to
make sure they were buried with him

  in the event of my return i was to
get the necessary court order to have
the body dug up and claim my fortune
if i never appeared the stones were to
remain forever buried with him

  there followed a description of the
secret cupboard in my room in which
the judge was instructed to place the
will against my return a truly remark-
able document apparently the judge-
had carried out his instructions to the
letter for i had not the slightest doubt
that the glittering mass apparent over
the heart of my fathers ghost was
actually the fortune in diamonds

  the whole thing was so uncanny so
weird that for a little while i sat there
as one stupified this thing defied all
physical laws and yet-it had happened
i examined the signatures of the wit-
nesses dr nevins was one and the
other was samuel higgins ruths
father he then had known of this
will too and had never told ruth-or
probably anyone else

it was broad daylight now and i be-
gan to dress since i had planned to
tell ruths parents that morning who i
really was i decided to go right over
there and take the will with me mr
higgins would advise me what steps to
take accordingly immediately after
breakfast i walked over to ruths house
i found ir higgins out watering the
lawn he greeted me cordially

 well mr evans and how are you
this morning slept well i hope

  yes thanks and you

  never better

 mr higgins-i wonder if i might
see you alone for a few moments

  why-certainly wait til i shut this
off and ill be right with you

  he turned off the faucet and led the
way into his library

  now sir what can i do for you

  i took the will from my pocket and
laid it on the table before him

  youve seen this before mr hig-
gins 

 he picked it up and glanced at it
curiously then recognizing it his whole
attitude stiffened to attention

 major durhams will what does
this mean sir he regarded me in-
tently

  i found it-where my father had it
hidden

 his face paled then you are
not-

 george evans no-im ralph dur-
ham

 he scrutinized my face closely i
could see that he was trying to recon-
cile my present personality with that of
the boy he had last seen fifteen years
before at last i saw by his face that
he was convinced but he pretended to be
skeptical for awhile longer

  can you prove that
ghost stories



  of course i have plenty of creden-
tials then i grinned you might
ask ruth she recognized me imme-
diately last night

  his face softened and he came around
the table with outstretched hand

  ruth would know he said huskily
for a moment we stood hands clasped
searching each others faces and each
seemed satisfied with what he saw

  youve kept her waiting a long time
young fellow he said finally but it
was either you or no one with ruth
i know shes a wonderful girl mr
higgins-much too good for me if i
dont do everything in my power to make
up to her for those years of waiting
from now on i hope youll come gunning
for me

 i promise you i will we both
laughed a bit shakily coughed blew our
noses and then settled down to discuss
the will

he told me of being called in to wit-
ness it a short time before fathers
death mainly i think he said be-
cause i was ruths father he was
mighty fond of ruth the major and it

was the dream of his life that some day
you would return and marry her he
didnt want to raise any false hopes so
he asked me to say nothing to her about
this will-and i never have

  in fact he added i dont suppose
anyone but just those actually concerned
in drawing it up knows about the mat-
ter itll be a nine days wonder in this
town when the truth becomes known
we sat there in silence for awhile then
he continued

  dr nevins died shortly after your
father the judge is still on circuit but
he ought to be blowing in here one of
these days pretty soon youd better
stick around til he gets home and hell
fix everything up for you in short order
always fond of you the judge was by
the way when do you and ruth figure
to get married

  we havent talked about a date as
soon as possible if shes willing

  as a matter of fact we were married
within the month judge wyckham re-
turned sooner than we expected and set
in motion the legal machinery necessary
to secure me my fortune as mr hig-
gins predicted my return was the talk

of the town for many days and they
havent stopped talking yet of the ec-
centric major durham and his diamonds

  my step-mother who was out of her
mind we took care of until her death
which occurred a short time after our
marriage little mrs southwick who
took the credit for bringing the higgins
family and me together again has been
made happy beyond her fondest dreams
i gave her the old homestead as a
present

  ive never told ruth or anyone else
the true story of how i found my fathers
will who would believe a thing so im-
probable

  yet it happened and one other visita-
tion i received from my father since
then it was on the day of my marriage
to ruth the minister was pronouncing
us man and wife there in a little church
we had attended as children and as i
glanced up at the bank of lillies about
us once more i saw it faintly but dis-
tinctly-that kind old face of my father
now smiling and happy i knew then
that he was content

 i might add that ruth and i have
found great happiness since that day

they ranged a phantom for murder

                                  continued from page 

them together-and also to prevent any
fraudulent phenomena

  the two young people began passing
out the slates at random to various per-
sons in the hall it seemed almost a co-
incidence that the doctor and i should
each receive a pair the doctors slate
had one piece of white chalk on it

  i took the pair of slates given me
and examined them they were one of
the pair the doctor had brought for us
and had the three screws which were
screwed down as firmly as when we had
placed them on the table my pair con-
tained no chalk and i was greatly disap-
pointed as i was afraid i would receive
no message

after looking them over carefully
and wiping them a few times with
my handkerchief to make sure they were
absolutely clean i then laid them on the
floor and placed my foot on them

  in the meantime the medium had gone
into a trance or coma presently va-
rious persons began to feel as though
something was writing inside of their
slates and very soon several of them
held up their slates completely filled
with writing one slate was in the
morse code written to a telegraph
agent while several were written in for-
eign languages-especially one which
finally had to be read by a chinaman

  all at once i heard something scratch-
ing inside of dr ralstons slates and
presently he opened them to find this
message

   you wont accomplish your de-
 sire tonight and in the other world
 you will also be thwarted as justice
 cannot be cheated

signed your cousin

               joe wakefield

 the doctor seemed very much dis-
pleased and disturbed by this message

  almost instantly i began to feel some-
thing vibrating and scratching between
my slates after the scratching had
ceased i opened my slates and found
this weird and uncanny message

   you will be face to face with
 death this evening and you will
 escape him only to meet him ter
 who knows what the outcome will
 be i see a hangmans noose coil
 and drop around your neck you
 also will seem to lose something of
 great value

          signed your uncle

        david lenard woods

  the cold sweat stood out on my fore-
head i trembled as though stricken
with a siege of ague but i hid my dis-
comfort as best i could and kept dr
ralston from looking at my message

  after almost everyone had received a
message either by slate or independent
answers to their questions the medium
said he was in the right condition to give
a few demonstrations of materializing-
which amounts to having the dead re-
turn with seemingly their earthly bodies
and converse with the living the me-
dium then selected three men of whom
i happened to be one to come up behind
a screen placed for the occasion and
strip him from head to foot to see that
he had no paraphernalia from which lie
might produce or imitate fraudulent
spooks

  after we were all satisfied that he had
nothing to produce spooks with we gave
him some silk pajamas to put on then
we placed him in the cabinet it was a
three sided affair built for the purpose
resembling a screen after he was
seated inside this we placed his feet

in a pan of meal

  we also had a man one of the three of
us sit in the cabinet and hold his hands
all during the seance this second
seance was conducted in semi-darkness
yet it was quite light enough to dis-
tinguish different objects in the room

the medium went into a trance and
after a short wait a white-like sub-
stance that reminded me of a spider
web began to flow from his mouth
soon faces began to take form out of
this substance sometimes an arm
would appear or a foot finally to my
astonishment a voice in the cabinet
which came from the mediums mouth
but which i would have known any-
where as my fathers called out doc-
tor grey come up to the cabinet your
father is here i

  i walked up close my nerves tingling
i could hardly believe my eyes there
stood my father he was exactly
as i had known him in life just be-
fore he died except that he looked far
more radiant and younger yet his
face wore a worried expression as if he
had been having a great deal of trouble

  charley my boy he said in quiet
tones you are in terrible danger and i
see much evil around you i am afraid
   but have courage-i will do all i
can to protect you give my love to
nadine nadine is my wifes name

 he smiled at me and began melting
away or dematerializing until just his
head remained above the floor his
radiant features gradually drew down
to an almost dazzling flash of light then
he was gone completely

  believe me if you think the slate mes-
sage unnerved me you should have seen
me at that moment by turns i became
icy cold and burning hot i dont think


ghost stories

there was a dry thread on me the
doctor was greatly upset and now my
lelief which i had held from the first
that he was a magician grew stronger
i fully believe that this was the first
time dr ralston had been brought face
to face with the genuine goods i had
better state for those of you that may
lie skeptical that twelve forms in all
appeared at this materialization some
were children of whom several were
not recognized although most of the
spirits were many people went away
firm believers while the skeptics went
away as they came saying it was the
work of the devil

  after the meeting the doctor and i
both secured our slates by each paying
the sum of one dollar i would gladly
have given a thousand dollars or even
more for the experience of seeing and
conversing with my father

  on the way home the doctor started
in making insinuating remarks about
miss turner and myself this kept up
until i could endure hi vile tongue no
longer my blood boiled i told him in
suppressed tones about seeing him make
love to my wife i was driving the car
at the time and as we were approaching
a bridge at the bottom of a steep hill
with almost cat-like agility he grabbed
the steering wheel out of my hands and
headed the car for the side of the bridge

  to late i saw this fiends plan for
getting me to come to the meeting with
him now i realized why he didnt ask
my wife to come along for he intended
murdering me and having it appear as
accidental before i could check him
he headed the car straight through the
side of the bridge there was a deep
rock-strewn ravine below

just before the car hit the bridge the
doctor gave me a mocking laugh and
jumped intending to land on the bank
ahead of the bridge but lie must have
lost his footing or the car gaining speed
altered his calculations for he gave forth
the most fiendish cry of mortal terror i
have ever heard it reminded me of a
rat that is cornered and knows that it is
going to die i jumped just as the crash
came and managed to land on my hands
and knees on the bank ahead of the
bridge the car went crashing down
below to be smashed into complete
wreckage

  outside of a few cuts and bruises i
was none the worse for the affair al-
though my nerves were playing havoc
with me i picked my way very cau-
tiously until at last i reached the bottom
of the ravine here i found what was
left of the car-and dr ralston he
was not dead when i arrived but kept
moaning i brought some water from
the stream and drenched him which
seemed to brighten him up at last lie
opened his eyes to stare at me

  as soon as he recognized me he
started cursing me and saying you
win now but damn you ill win her yet
and  will come back and haunt you
with hate then as i am hating you now

  after that outburst of passion the
blood started flowing faster a tremor
rocked his whole body his eyes began
to glaze and roll upward with his last
death rattle he wheezed out damn
you grey

  the car was a total wreck but among
the wreckage i found my slate it was
unscathed save for a few blurs dr
ralstons slate was demolished almost
beyond recognition

  i walked about a mile down the road
until i came to a ranch i told them
that we had had an accident and that
my companion dr ralston was killed
i had them summon an ambulance from
one of the undertakers in los angeles
and also a taxi to pick me up

 my wife was greatly shocked when
she learned the news of the doctors
death and how nearly i had come to be-
ing killed she seemed greatly worried
about my slate when she read about the
hangmans noose she said she had been
having some messages coming to her
from her guides that seemed to speak
of foreboding evil but they always came
in sj-mbols she couldnt understand i
tried to laugh it off to keep her from
worrying but i cant say i wasnt glad
when dr ralston was put away for
keeps into the cold cold ground

  shortly before the doctors death he
had started rumors around the town to
the effect that miss turner and i had
been carrying on an illicit love affair
the scandal was started and my pa-
tients began leaving me in such numbers
that i became frantic

about this time a wisdom tooth be-
came ulcerated and i was obliged to
call in a dentist after the dentist exam-
ined me he found another tooth that was
diseased and advised me to take gas
while he extracted them

  i did not want this but i finally con-
sented to take the anesthetic and soon f
was under its influence it seemed as
though i was floating in space and my
soul was freed from its encasement of
flesh i felt so restful and calm better
than i had felt for months for the pass-
ing events had proven a terrible strain
on me

  i seemed to be able to look down at
the dentist who was working on my
body at times it seemed as though i
saw forms and faces flit by me and i
seemed to catch fragments of thought
vibrations part of which i couldnt un-
derstand then almost at once i was
jerked back into my body and i coidd
faintly hear the dentist saying to my
assistant he is coming out of it

o	k then he began pumping oxygen
into me i felt almost angry at the
dentist for bringing me back to this
world of worry and strife

  a few days later i seemed to hear
dr ralstons voice calling to me and
saying why dont you administer
yourself some gas and rest in peace and
contentment

  i tried to shake this feeling off but at
last i couldnt stand it any longer and
after telling my assistant that i was
through for the day and that she could
go i locked the door and made ready to
take another peaceful soul flight and
explore the mysteries of the unknown

 i was soon experiencing the same
ecstasies i had experienced on the pre-
vious occasion here was contentment
peace and rest and for a while i just
floated in the ether i soon learned by
a kind of mental vibration that these
faces i had encountered were the souls

of men who once had lived on earth but
through some laws that they had broken
were doomed to be earth-bound some
of them were doomed to float about the
earth plane for centuries before they
would be able to work out their salva-
tion i expected to see dr ralston
among them for did he not have the
heart and soul of a murderer but i
didnt see anything of him it seemed
as though i had been in this world of
spirits a long time when in reality it
was but a few moments i was grad-
ually pulled back into my earthly body
and soon i gained consciousness again

  i kept this secret practice up for sev-
eral months until it was beginning to
tell on me even my old friends who
had stuck to me while the scandal was
raging full blast began winking and
tapping their heads as though they
thought i was losing my mind

  at last came the day that ill never
forget-the day that brings this narra-
tive to a climax the wife for several
days had been complaining of several
teeth that were almost driving her fran-
tic she had insisted that i pull them
but already my lady of the gas had
fastened her tentacles on me and i
didnt want to be cheated out of the en-
joyment i derived from my new-found
revelation

  i sent my asssistant away as usual
which had become of late almost a daily
custom and soon i had the mask over
my face and was thrilling from head to
foot with expectancy at last  was
freed of my earthly carcass but in giv-
ing the gas i must have been in too big
a hurry heretofore an elastic-like
silken cord held my soul to the body of
flesh now i felt it snap and i shot
up into a void which i cant describe
as space as i seemed to be beyond the
control of gravity

as i shot upward i looked back i
saw my earthly body topple from
the dentist chair and slump down in a
heap almost at once i heard a fiendish
laugh i knew it to be dr ralstons
and too late i realized his horrible pur-
pose

  in a second it seemed to me i saw my
earthly body squirming around on the
floor stretching first one arm out then
another and gradually get to its feet
then i saw my own face distorted with
passion and lust grinning at me in a
fashion that would put the devil him-
self to shame

  i next saw my wife enter the room
at first this puzzled me but i remem-
bered i hadnt locked the door as usual
dr ralston in my body walked up to
my wife and smiled in my usual way
he patted her on the back sympathet-
ically what was going to happen next

  he placed her in the chair and made
ready to extract her teeth he adjusted
the mask over her face and began pump-
ing i was frozen with horror wouldnt
the fiend ever stop pumping then it
dawned on me that he was murdering
her i couldnt utter a word of warning
and if i could have i knew it would
never be understood because only thought
telepathy is effective on the astral plane
my brain was paralyzed from the sheer
horror of the situation

  at last my wifes body slumped down
ghost stories



in the chair and began getting rigid
then i saw her coming toward me with
her arms outstretched and just as i
was going to hold her to me i heard
that fiendish laughter i knew so well
the next thing i knew dr ralston had
grabbed my wife out from my grasp and
the two of them floated upward clear
through the ceiling of the office and
away to where i knew not

  i spent what was to me years of agony
in search of my wife but never a trace
of her at last worn out and heart
broken i found myself back beside my
old body and by sheer will power i
pried my way back into it i had been
out of my earthly body only a few
minutes yet it was long enough for the
doctor allied with his band of black
artisans to accomplish his fiendish deed

  i came to earthly consciousness slow-
ly hoping against hope that this was
only the fantasy of a tired deranged
brain but alas i found my wife stretched
out on the floor just as i had looked
down upon her while in the astral plane
i gathered her in my arms tenderly and
tried to bring her to life but to no avail
finally i went for help and what was
my surprise and anger when two officers
of the law placed me under arrest for
the murder of my wife the irony of it
the treasure i valued above all else
and to think the world brands me as
her murderer

  no wonder i pace back and forth in
my cell like some untamed animal it is
not the fear to die but the irony of
justice as man knows it for months
i was silent only to the extent that i
plead not guilty which as god al-
mighty is my judge is the truth i find
little consolation in the bible although
i have read it through three times if

it were not for the knowledge of another
world and of spiritual truths and phe-
nomena that i have proven i wouldnt
be consoled but i know that out in
that great beyond my beloved wife is
anxiously waiting for me with all the
tenderness known to woman

after several months of grilling
and third-degreeing which i look
back on with horror i at last confided in
my attorney these facts which i have
here given to you he laughed at me
and said i was crazy god knows some-
times i think i am with all the sorrow
and torment i have gone through i
wouldnt consent to be examined by an
alienist but needless to say i was placed
in the hands of three of the greatest
alienists in america and europe and
they all agreed that i was sane at any
rate sane enough not to be excused from
paying the death penalty

  the infallible finger print system used
in this country if nothing else doomed
me for did not the police find my finger
prints all over my wifes body also over
the gas mask and pumping mechanism

  well i was judged guilty of murder in
the first degree and now i wait the com-
ing of the day at ten oclock in the
morning when i an innocent man will
pay the price by hanging by the neck
until dead i await not in fear but
with rejoicing for will i not meet my
beloved wife and possibly justice
will not be cheated it may be that it
will be dr ralston who will pay the
price-not i

ghost stories

only living relative of dr grey must
state that although all of doctor greys
wealth was spent along with what i had
in the legal fight to save the doctors life
we could do nothing he was hanged by
the neck until dead

but let no one dare say that he did
not go to the gallows like the brave man

that he was he knew that he was in
the right

  also i would like to state that a me-
dium in europe on the very afternoon
doctor grey was supposed to have mur-
dered his wife received a slate message
describing in full the details as doctor
grey gave them to the public but the

jury refused to credit it a coincidence
some will say but let the skeptic laugh
that is life

 they hanged him no it was his
phantom they hanged not the doctor
grey that had lived on earth it was
his spirit they hanged they could not
harm that

under the spell of the red circle

                                  continued from page 

 down and placed her hands on her hips

 ah lak fer t know how yo is gwine
 to heah noises when yo make so much
 noise yoself that-

 she turned bulging eyes suddenly upon
 the offending wall holding up her
 hand a faint thumping sound was
 heard by everyone lasting but a moment

 water pipe suggested dr grover
 togo is probably using an outside
 faucet

n-no suh sam ventured de
watah pipe am undah de flo suh

 but the sound began again this time
 a trifle fainter a curious bumping or
 pounding noise muffled as though com-
 ing from a great distance

dere yo is  cried mammy jane
triumphantly deres yo noises ise
no fool 

 the sounds ceased abruptly

whats on the other side asked
t ravers

mammys room said evelyn

 ah gets it cornin an goinl cried
 mammy jane if im heah i heahs it
 an if im dere ah heahs it but all
 allows im done trough heahin it from
 now on ah packs up today 

now mammy said dr grover
youve been packing up ever since
youve been here just catm yourself

and-

 clam mahself nuthinl

probably rats ventured evelyn
if-

suddenly there was a loud crash in
the dining-room and the group rushed
in to find a large painting on the floor
lying in the center of the carpet right
at the edge of the table fragments of
glass were scattered around it

the wire broke said the doctor
picking it up strange that it fell so
far from the wall

 but-the wire isnt broken  cried
 robert and look-the nail is still in
 the wall

d-d-d-dis h-house am hanted i
gasped mammy jane seizing sam who
recoiled as if he had been shot

 dont skeer me dat way woman he
 cried trembling

 the doctor glanced at the painting
 and then at the wall

a distance of ten feet he said
puzzled this frame is too heavy to
roll the nail is still there the wire is

as good as ever theres no wind-

 a sudden sound arrested their atten-
 tion coming from the living-room it
 was a weird mocking laugh that rose
 to a shrill unearthly crescendo

evelyn screamed and tottered and
travers rushed forward to catch her

 just as a large black object bounded
 from the living-room into their midst
 jumped to the table glaring at them
 with eyes of fire and jumped to the
 floor dr grover whipped out his auto-
 matic and fired at it

 the cat gasped travers supporting
 the limp form of evelyn

 missed him grunted the doctor sav-
 agely as the animal escaped through the
 kitchen door ill get him

 he ran out and they heard him gasp
 gone how did the devil get out
 the back doors closed

 evelyn was moaning trembling vio-
 lently in travers arms as the doctor
 rushed into the room again

evelyn he cried evelyn-

 her eyes fluttered and opened as they
 carried her hastily to a chair her lips
 trembled and she stared at them with
 a crazed terrified expression struggling
 violently

 let me go she screamed in a shrill
 voice then she saw travers and
 smiled rising

 anthony she cried joyously extend-
 ing her arms toward him save me
 anthony

 he held out his arms impulsively and
 the doctor and mrs grover released her
 staring as she crept close to travers
 and kissed him upon the lips

evelyn- cried robert taking a

 step toward them the doctor placed a
 hand on his shoulder

 wait bob he cautioned as travers
 forced her away from him and held her
 at arms length

dont you know me cried evelyn
in a quaint high voice i am marie
your wife-marie jacques

 what cried travers aghast your

father is-is captain jacques-

 he stared at the doctor

 yes anthony cried the girl holding
 his face between her slim hands my
 father-your uncle anthony-where is
 he

good god gasped travers weakly
he took a deep breath and glanced at
the others grimly

 let us face this here and now he
 said his face pale eyes flashing
 doctor

 yes cried dr grover nodding go
 ahead professor

he motioned for the others to sit
down

 marie said travers softly putting
 an arm about her what has happened

 she was about to answer when a low
 wailing sound came from somewhere in
 the house she swayed and fell gasp-
 ing father

dr grover rushed forward and he

and travers caught her

 fainted i grunted the doctor
mammy-water quick 

  then as from a great distance they
heard once again that diabolical mock-
ing laugh

ches coming to said the doctor
handing back the glass of water to
the trembling negress

  evelyn opened her eyes

 oh-daddy she cried i must
have fainted

  you did her father answered grim-
ly glancing at travers who had started
from the room

where are you going professor
im going to explore the house said
travers that weird laugh-that moan-
ing it must come from somewhere
he strode into the living-room and
evelyn rose from the floor weakly

  ill be all right daddy what-what
has happened

 wh-wh-what has happened gasped
sam suddenly finding his voice -de
house am hanted mammys right
dis-

  silence sam said the doctor stern-
ly you and mammy pull yourselves
together and clear up the dishes

  it-its all right dis pullin togedder
bizness gasped sam but when ah
heahs dat knockin and groanin an dat
debblish laff ah knows ill done fall
apaht aginl

  mrs grover comforted the terrified
negro woman

 sam you ought to be ashamed 
yourself she said youre more
frightened than mammy jane and youre
a man

  mrs grover was far from being calm
herself and robert was trembling visibly
as for mammy she was speechless and
gray with fright

  come said the doctor let us go
to the living-room sam pick up that
picture and hang it up again and quit
shaking

  y-y-yes suh

the kitchen door opened and togo
the gardener canie in pausing as he
saw that the dining-room door was open
and the family staring at him

  ah togo said the doctor i ex-
pect he wants his dinner mammy jane
the negress stirred feebly and went
into the kitchen

  did you see the cat togo asked
the doctor

  me no see cat the japanese replied
  where were you

  sweep out garage-just now lock up
  have you kept your eyes open all
ghost stories



  day for any strange occurrences-

 yes doctor the oriental affirmed
 nodding me hear shot while ago
 yes

 the doctor laughed grimly

 yes i fired at that confounded cat
 have your supper togo and when you
 get through report to me in the living-
 room

 yes sir

the doctor put his arms around
evelyn and mrs grover and robert
followed them into the next room

 im going to put on a guard dr
 grover said as they seated themselves
 before the fireplace

 a guard exclaimed mrs grover
 yes every night the professor
 myself togo and sam can you stay
 tonight robert

 why exclaimed briton paling i-

i could-

 but youd rather not eh said the
 doctor grinning well i dont want
 you to against your will do you be-
 lieve that the house is haunted bob

 i dont know what to believe said
 robert those odd noises that picture
 falling in the center of the room too
 that strange laugh and that big black
 cat-

 i know its all a puzzle but surely
 you dont think it is all due to super-
 natural causes

 no-i dont believe in spirits that
 all tommyrot

 evelyn forced a wan smile

 neither do i bobby she said

 of course its absurd began the
 doctor   

 a step was heard on the stairs and
 they started and glanced up it was
 travers who descended rapidly and
 came towards them

doctor grover he said gravely
how do you get into the attic

 why-there are two attics professor
 this is the old section of the house were
 in now the attic to this is reached
 through the closet upstairs youd have
 to take a step-ladder and raise a square
 trap-door in the ceiling i expect its
 pretty dujty

 travers took a seat

 has it been opened recently

not for years when we had the
house wired is the last time thats been
twenty years ago or more before
evelyn was born

 nothing is stored there then

 no not in either attic we use the
 cellar for that its quite large the
 other attic is entered through a trap-
 door in the same manner placed in the
 ceiling of the hall

well-do both upper sections con-
nect

 yes through the hall upstairs the
 door in the end leads in to it but we
 keep it closed because the four guest
 rooms in that section are seldom used
 but why do you ask about the attics
 travers shrugged

 i was wondering if they were used
 judging from the outside they are quite
 commodious

 the doctor nodded

 but too inaccessible

 they talked at some length about the
 general construction of the house
 an odd feature was brought to light

 the inner walls of the downstairs portion
 of the old building were of brick plas-
 tered over and travers suggested the
 possibility of a secret passage

  very improbable said the doctor
the outside walls are three feet thick
being built to withstand attack and the
rest of the old section conforms to stur-
diness throughout the inner walls are
only two feet thick and even allowing
a single wall of bricks on each side the
space would hardly be large enough for
a passage the original shutters were
massive things with loop-holes so that
occupants could fire on an enemy from
within

  travers wondered if the walls were
all solid and the doctor mentioned the
difficulty the electricians and plumbers
had in drilling through-them at various
points

  togo and sam entered and the doc-
tor explained his plan of guard duty
travers nodding approval the family
would retire at nine and sam could take
the first shift from nine to twelve the
old negro was quite dubious however
and wanted to know if the lights could
be left on

  why sam laughed the doctor if
it was dark and a burglar should come
he couldnt see you

 ah duno suh exclaimed the old
negro ahm not so skeered bout bug-
glers suh as ghosts and ghosts is
skeered ob light

  travers put him at ease by stating
that he would work on the ancient code
in the library until twelve when he
would relieve sam and patrol the house
until two-thirty it was finally decided
that the doctor would take the next shift
from two-thirty to four-thirty after
which togo would officiate

  now that thats settled exclaimed
evelyn lets go to the music-room and
liven up this old house a bit its enough
to give one the creeps without contin-
ually talking about it

evelyn played the piano for them
and travers was agreeably surprised
by her deft artistry he had studied
music himself when a boy and had com-
posed an opera when he was twenty-one
that had been praised highly but had
never been produced

  she had two years at a conservatory
in boston mrs grover said and was
doing remarkably well up until her ac-
cident when she becomes stronger
she must resume her studies

  by all means exclaimed travers
he requested a few numbers and lis-
tened with rapt attention to a delicate
rendition of rachmaninoffs prelude fol-
lowed by brahms eccentric hungarian
dance number five

 she turned and beamed upon them
it seems so good to be up and about
she said and this old house needs
music to enliven it

  evelyn doesnt play ragtime re-
marked robert as if this was a pardon-
able defect

 neither do i laughed travers
somehow i cant accept the mood it
seems-barbaric

  oh do you play exclaimed evelyn
rising please let us hear you
travers shook his head

  im all out of practice besides i

would be apt to reflect the mood  this
old manse

  he glanced up at the massive dark-
ened beams evelyn laughed and came
over and seized him by the hand

  please she pleaded if you want
to you can start off with the ghost
dance

  he laughed and rose

  go as far as you like professor 
said the doctor

  i might ask you to turn off the
lights warned travers smiling as he
seated himself at the piano

  he played the ghost dance falling
into the mood and weirdly improvising
sweeping into the crashing staccato
chords with powerful nimble fingers
then on into peer gynt transcribing the
ominous portent of the ancient house in
improvisation

  oh  exclaimed evelyn as he finished
that was creepy i ugh i i could see
grinning skeletons and hideous ogres
peeking at us 

  ill say it was creepy  exclaimed
robert you certainly can play pro-
fessor

  at evelyns request travers played
liszts hungarian rhapsody number
two from memory it had been two
years since he had played it but it was
one of his favorites and he played with
a facile expressive adroitness that held
evelyn in rapt ecstacy robert how-
ever stirred uneasily during the slow
opening portion wondering what people
could see in classical music

  he recalled evelyns impulsive caress
bestowed upon travers while in her
strange lapse of identity he glanced
sullenly at the professor travers had
not evaded the kiss he had noted it
seemed rather that he had responded
affectionately-too affectionately

  evelyn was mad perhaps he was
engaged to a crazy person for some
reason the doctor and mrs grover had
kept the truth from him he resented
this their explaining that evelyns at-
tacks were hallucinations but why
should they encourage a stranger like
travers to become amorously attentive
toward her evelyn hadnt known what
she was doing when she kissed travers

the professor swept into the finale
of the rhapsody unaware of the
brooding resentment of young briton
though evelyn was conscious of roberts
unusual solemnity attributing it how-
ever to the disquieting occurrences of
the day

  bobby looks positively bored  she
laughed as traverg rose that was
splendid professor

  oh exclaimed robert flushing i
suppose im sleepy

  why said the doctor glancing at
the clock in the living-room its only
eight oclock

  robert rose

  i really must get back to richmond
and its a long drive

  the doctor suggested that he remain
over night

  not by a jug-full robert said em-
phatically ive had enough excite-
ment for one day this place gets un-
der my skin that strange laugh and
those noises are too much for me

  the doctor shrugged


g  s t stre s

  theyre too much for us too he said
grimly i confess that i am completely
at a loss to account for the disturbances

  evelyn saw robert off in the car
while the others gravely forced them-
selves to face the mysterious facts mrs
grover was the most cheerfully disposed
attributing the noises to natural causes
that would be later explained the doc-
tor and travers were both thankful for
her placid scepticism

 evelyn returned frowning and mrs
grover gave her a startled glance

  why dear you look cross about
something

  evelyn shrugged

  oh its bob we-we quarreled
she said briefly i-i think ill turn in
if you dont mind

  there was an embarrassing silence
mrs grover rose and glanced at her
husband

  i think ill stay with evelyn tonight
john youll excuse us professor

  of course

  ill be up later ann good night
good night she said smiling upon
the professor who bowed and she and
evelyn turned toward the stairs

the doctor rang for sam and the
aged negro appeared timidly and ap-
proached them

  sam said dr grover the profes-
sor and i arc going in to the library
fix us some mint juleps and bring
them in

   yes suit

  the old servant started oft with
alacrity

  and sam

  yes sub

  you can fix one for yourself you
might need it

  y-y-yes suh

  the doctor grinned at travers and
led the way into the library where they
sat down and lit cigars

  sams in a bad way remarked
travers

  i cant say as i blame him replied
the doctor stroking his beard thought-
fully those noises that picture fall-
ing-that laugli of course all negroes
are superstitious but weve never been
troubled before like this its so damned
uncanny of course mammy jane has
thought she heard noises in the kitchen
before but we all laughed at her but
confound it we all heard them tonight
and then a heavy picture weighing all
of forty pounds jumps from the wall
and lands in the center of the room
the wire is unbroken the nail still in
the wall and a weird sardonic laugh

coming from nowhere-

he threw up his hands helplessly
what can you make of it he said
and poor evelyn she called you
anthony didnt she said she was-
your wife i

  travers was lost in thought

  yes lie said at length doctor i
want you to tell me some more about
our dealings with that human devil
tracy

  dr grover frowned

  there isnt much more that i can tell
hes dead now and i suppose his or-
ganization is scattered

  the red circic said travers i
mean what took place between you and

tracy when he had the audacity to
visit you

  well said the doctor as i told you
tracy and his confounded red circic
wanted this house the first attempt
was made by letter from a real estate
man in williamsburg stating that a
client desired this estate and wanted to
know my terms i wrote stating that
the place was not for sale about two
weeks later i received another letter
from -the same agent making a cash
offer of fifty thousand dollars i have
enough money to get along comfortably
and the offer was nothing startling i
refused

  he flicked the ash from his cigar
sam appeared with the mint juleps and
served them with a proud deference

 sams a past master at making
juleps said the doctor he even has
a bed of selected mint that lie grows
himself

  real southern hospitality smiled
travers sipping the delectable beverage

 that will do sam and when nine
oclock strikes report to me for orders

 the butler bowed resignedly and
ambled out

  well said the doctor after refus-
ing to sell the second tiire i considered
the matter settled however i received
another offer this time of seventy-five
thousand dollars someone evidently
wanted the old place pretty badly but
i refused writing that it was not for
sale at any price

  a month passed and i got a letter
postmarked richmond warning me to
evacuate the premises within two weeks
or i would be sorry it was typewritten
and without signature

  hm travers looked thoughtful

  i turned the letter over to the au-
thorities along with the others the
agent was arrested on suspicion and
explained that a woman of about forty
years of age fashionably dressed had
requested him to buy the place for her
the police looked up her address at a
hotel in richmond and found that she
had moved leaving no trace the agent
was  doubt innocent and was re-
leased but the police could not trace
the warning letter

  four days later i received a second
warning this time togo happened to
be behind a hedge and saw a man sneak
into the driveway and deposit the letter
in the mail box and hastily depart the
jap was suspicious and ran in and in-
formed me we got out my car and
started in pursuit the man was in the
act of stepping in a car when we turned
into the highway and saw us hastily
starting his machine and speeding away

  my locomobile can do eighty miles
an hour when pressed and togo gave
chase gradually gaining on the man
whom we saw was alone i keep a re-
volver in the car and i got it out and
as we drew alongside i ordered the
fellow to stop his machine he saw
that i meant business and did so he
was a pale emaciated man of about
thirty-five and professed indignation at
being detained denying that he had de-
livered the letter we made him get
into the car and drove back to the
house and while togo and sam guarded
him i examined the letter sure enough
it was another warning unsigned as

usual and i was informed that i had
ten more days to get out

  dr grover laughed

 to leave my own house he said
i phoned the police they took the
fellow in custody and while on the way
to the police station he made an attempt
to escape jumping from the car they
fired- at him and he dropped the bul-
let had pierced his lung they brought
him back to me tor professional atten-
tion but the poor devil was past all
help he was rather sickly anyway
and the end came fast but before he
died travers he grew hysterical gasp-
ing out the red circic-i am damned

i questioned him pitilessly ronald
tracy he gasped and mumbled an ad-
dress which we took down and then
he passed out

  he paused blowing a cloud of smoke
toward the ceiling

  the rendezvous of tracys red circic
cult was found at the address given in
richmond and the place raided the
chief himself escaped travers we
found men and women and children
virtual prisoners in this terrible place
most of them stark mad one of the
women confessed as you will no doubt
recollect from the newspaper headlines
exposing the diabolical practises

  tracy however could not be located
and seven days later i received the
third warning by mail postmarked
richmond-but professor this time
there was a signature it was a circle
drawn in red ink

 ah the masquerading was over
they decided to come from under cover
eh

  exactly the police sent a detail oi
two picked men to guard this house
on the third day they were here the
day i was supposed to pack up and get
out a man was seen creeping across
the lower end of the estate the de-
tectives gave chase and they had no
sooner disappeared when a car swept
into the driveway and a tall man
dressed in black stepped out and ap-
proached the house leaving the chauffeur
waiting in the car i saw him approach
the house from this window he said
indicating a window that faced the front
and sam answered his ring bringing
me this card  

he took a bill fold from his pocket
and handed travers a calling card
upon which was the neat engraved
inscription

dr ronald tracy

 the nerve of the man exclaimed
travers

 i told sam to send him in tin-
man entered he was tall and thin
with a positively satanic cast of coun-
tenance pale with piercing black eyes
deeply set and thin lips that bore a
peculiar sarcastic smile he bowed and
extended his bony hand

   good morning dr grover he said
you are no doubt surprised to see me
i ignored his hand and he grinned

   you know that you are wanted b
the police i asked him oh that he
laughed leering at me you and the
bungling police have slightly annoyed
nu in- said still with that sarcastic
g ii o s t s tori e s



smile and leer that made me furious

  what is your business here i de-
manded you are quite a capable sur-
geon doctor he said i have always
wanted to look into the brain of a
surgeon

  the way he said it is hard to de-
scribe it chiliad me to the bone

  come to the point  i retorted
what is your mission

  he grinned at me in his cool cal-
culating way

   briefly doctor he said i want this
house it is indispensable in my work
i mean to have it

  is that sol i exclaimed that is
interesting i must say as the house
is mine and i intend to remain i am
afraid that you will be disappointed
hardly disappointed doctor he said
you can remain if you wish he
laughed again and now he grinned
i want you to come and consult with
me on an operation i am going to per-
form 

  travers shuddered

  i am sorry tracy i said but 
have to hold you until the detectives re-
turn he was not the least disturbed
they will never return he laughed
ive fixed that travers he seemed to
actually gloat over me if you can un-
derstand are you coming with me
he asked or must i use force all the
time he stood placidly eyeing me it
was diabolical

  i told him that we would both re-
main and that i would send for the
williamsburg police i was about to
rise when suddenly i was seized from
behind by powerful arms and a gag
placed over my mouth it was incred-
ible i was facing the door and  one
could have entered without me seeing
them the windows were open but
screened yet two of tracys accom-
plices were binding my wrists they
must have gotten into the house and
remained hidden behind that japanese
screen there i was gagged bound
and helpless in my own house under a
police guard with togo and sam some-
where about and mammy jane and my
wife upstairs i
then a surprising thing happened
tracy suddenly fell to the floor in a
fit and the men bent over him he
became rigid his eyes seeming the only
animate part of him his emaciated
face was bathed in perspiration the
automobile horn sounded a warning and
the men hastily lifted tracy and started
to carry him out can you guess what
happened next

  travers shook his head

  most anything i imagine

 sam saved the day unknown to
me he had suspected my mysterious
caller and armed with a double-barreled
shotgun he appeared suddenly and
pointed it at them

  jes freeze to d floor he told them
ahs powful nervous an dis heah gun
speaks mighty easy 

  travers uttered an exclamation
hooray for sam i wouldnt have
thought it possible

 well sir old sam called mammy
jane and my wife and they released me
i rang for the police telling them of the
disappearance of the detectives and my
capture of tracy and his confederates

sam and mammy stood guard over the
lot while i turned my attention to
tracy who lay on the floor without
power of speech or motion it looked
like a case of traumatic neurosis but of
course there was  wound his pulse
was a trifle high his temperature around
a hundred and five it was nothing
more or less than a sort of trance he
remained in that condition until the
police arrived the rest you probably
know-his conviction and sentence to
prison

  travers nodded

  also his escape i hadnt heard of
his death though until you told me
so then up until recently you havent
been troubled by the red circle

  not a bit only by evelyns un-
fortunate obsessions

  they were silent the heavy silence
of the ancient house hung like a brood-
ing omnipotence about them broken
only by the distant booming of the living-
room clock as it struck the hour of nine

  then footsteps sounded faintly  the
stairs

travers peeped cautiously out the
door and laughed

  only sani he said grinning at dr
grover my nerves must be on edge

  the old negro entered respectfully

  yes suh its nine oclock suh

  all right sam said the doctor
you will go on patrol right away
have you got that automatic handy

  yes suh

  the doctor explained that he was to
go slowly and quietly through all parts
of the house every half hour and to
report any suspicious noise or occur-
rence

  youd better do your roaming in your
stockings sam the doctor suggested
because we dont want to awaken mrs
grover and evelyn well leave the
lights on if you wish you seem to be
afraid of the dark the old section of
the house is all well bother with to-
night the hall door upstairs is locked
from this side and well lock the rest
of the doors leading to the new por-
tion-

  id patrol the entire house said
travers and unlock and re-lock the
doors each window should be exam-
ined with only a few opened at the
top for air and the rest locked sup-
pose we all go around together the first
time

this was effected each outside door
being discovered locked the win-
dows were examined some being dropped
a few inches at the top to admit air
one globe in each room was left burn-
ing both attics were entered by trav-
ers and found to be empty and terribly
dusty and finally the cellar was ex-
plored and its only entrance on the
outside of the building securely locked
mrs grover had retired with evelyn
and had locked their door from the in-
side the door of the hallway leading
from the old section to the new was
locked and the trio returned to the
library

  alls well said the doctor now
sam every half hour you can repeat
the excursion mr travers will relieve

ghost stories

 yes suh replied sam somewhat
weakly

  and now i think ill turn in are
you coming up too professor

  no said travers i think ill stay
up as i want to go over this code

 he took the ancient diary from his
pocket and drew up a chair to the doc-
tors writing desk and dr grover bid
him good night and departed with a
parting remark to sam to keep a careful
watch the old negro followed the doc-
tor into the living-room

 d-dat laugh we heerd suh-

 yes the doctor asked sharply
are you afraid sam

  well suh ahs not fraid ob bugglers

but when ghosts is concerned ah-

  dont be foolish snapped the doc-
tor irritably you darkies seem to be
a superstitious lot the lights will all
be on in every room and the professor
will be in the library until it is his turn
to relieve you forget it im going
to bed

  travers found the mysterious cipher
an enigma the long deceased andrew
brainard might possibly have written it
in either french or english that was
what made it doubly difficult of solution
no doubt it was a simple code letter
for letter the first page occupied his
labors for two hours during which time
sam made the rounds of the house four
times yet he was no nearer a solution
than when he started all of the letters
were run together and comparative elim-
ination was difficult

  sam made another round of the house
and at eleven-fifteen travers told him
that he could retire much to the old
negros relief

 he went through the house slowly
trying every door ard window stopping
in his room to put on a pair of felt
slippers and to obtain his revolver and
a flashlight the upstairs rooms in the
new section were given a careful scru-
tiny travers making sure that the win-
dows were all locked he then switched
off the lights and closed the hall door
and locked it putting the key in his
pocket the rest of the upper part of
the house containing his own room
evelyns and the grovers seemed in
peaceful order he heard the deep
breathing of the doctor coming through
the partly opened door of his room
mrs grover and evelyn were no doubt
peacefully sleeping behind the locked
door of evelyns room he left the
hall light burning

  downstairs travers closed the win-
dows and locked the doors of the rooms
not in use and retired to the library to
study the old diary with its baffling
cipher the way the letters were all
run together in unbroken lines across
the page tried his patience until sudden-
ly he found a single instance where a
line was broken at the bottom of a
page possibly it was a signature

tqsoib jotxqtos

  can it be that of andrew brainard
he exclaimed then he gave a start of
excitement the number of letters were
identical moreover certain letters were
repeated it was without a doubt the
code signature of brainard made in a
careless moment

  at lastl travers muttered

  he made out a chart starting with
the letters gained

a    t n   q 
b    j        
c        p     
d   s   q

  well he had eight letters  he wrote
out the first line of the diary that ap-
peared in code marking the known let-
ters underneath

  xnxdilpiznisfyginrtnxoizixmi
  i i e e ed e a ire el e

  travers pocketed the book and made
the rounds of the house again his
flashlight cut through the shrouds of
shadows that seemed to crouch menac-
ingly at every turn not a sound could
be heard the staccato ticking of the
living-room clock was the only audible
sign of life mechanical or otherwise

he returned to the library and for
some time studied the line he had
written one thing was probable the
line ended and began with a word
could the last seven letters spell the
word receive he filled it in

  xnxdilpi znisfygi nrtnxo izixm i
  iii e ec ed e a ireceive

  further filling in following the key
to the code rewarded his efforts with

  xnxdilpi znisfyginrtnxoizixmi
  itisexpectedofmethatireceive

  ah cried travers viewing the
lower line with satisfaction-so far so
good now i should be able to pro-
ceed-

  in twenty minutes he had the follow-
ing deciphered notation

      it is expected of me that i receive
  an anthony jacques ambassador of
  the commune in paris and afford
  him my assistance and the refuge of
  my home louis xvi and the queen
  have been beheaded as have many
  others and france is in the hands of
  the people certain royal jewels are
  to be sold and anthony jacques is
  coming here for that purpose his
  uncle captain jacques is an old
  scoundrel there seems to be no
  love for his nephew i will not tell
  him that the young man is coming

  travers sat in stupefied silence
evelyn in her trance had called him
anthony moreover she had said that
she marie was his wife-that captain
jacques was his uncle this then was
what doctor grover termed a hallucin-
ation was it possible that the spirit
of marie jacques haunted the old manse
speaking through evelyn

  what else can i believe he mut-
tered defiantly here is positive proof
i suppose the doctor will be skeptical

but he cannot change the fact however
evelyn had kissed him while ob-
sessed with the personality of the long
departed marie travers clenched his
hands involuntarily he had not been
under any delusions that he was this
anthony yet he had impulsively taken
her in his arms and returned her caress
was he in love with this girl had
he not been overstepping the bounds
of hospitality under the guise of humor-
ing her while in the trance

 he wondered what the doctor and
mrs grover thought they were prob-
ably concerned primarily with evelyns
condition however but then-evelyn
and robert briton had quarreled-about
that kiss no doubt briton had seemed
rather sulky   

  what connection had the late tracy
with all of this why had he and his
diabolical cult the red circle wanted
this house there must have been a
reason and the occurrences of that
day travers forced himself to con-
sider them

 a black cat with poisoned claws
mysterious noises in the wall hinting
of a secret passage the heavy picture
leaping from the wall and that weird
uncanny laugh coming from nowhere

  an old house generations old andrew
brainard captain jacques marie
jacques anthony jacques the com-
mune in paris royal jewels intrigue-
and ronald tracy now dead-the noises
that laugh   

  god what an enigma i he exclaimed
i-

 suddenly travers heard a shrill
scream that pierced the heavy silence
coming from above followed a hoarse
cry-the slamming of a door then the
lights went out abruptly-plunging the
house in darkness

damn who turned off those lights
travers groped for his flashlight
found it and whipping out his revolver
darted up the stairs he flashed the
light on the empty hallway now quiet
doctor he cried

  the doctor did not answer nor was
he in his room with racing pulses
travers halted outside the door of
evelyns room it was still locked he
knocked on the door

 mrs grover-it is i travers-

 thank god came mrs grovers
voice

  there was a fumbling with the lock
the door was swung open and he saw
the doctors wife and evelyn standing
in the glare of his flashlight pale and
terrified

what happened-who screamed
evelyn did some one was picking
at the door mrs grover cried dis-
traught we were so frightened i
where is john

 i-i dont know i hes not in his
room

they heard excited voices below and
footsteps ascending the stairs trav-
ers darted into the hall and turned his
light upon sam and togo

 wh-whos dat gasped sam stop-
ping

its me-travers said the profes-
sor have you seen the doctor sam
good lawd suh is he gone suh
yes who in hell turned out these
ghost stories



lights togo take sams flashlight
and go to the switch at the meter ii
its turned off put it on again hurry

  the gardener hurried off and the old
negro advanced

  oh where is daddy  cried evelyn
she raised her voice

 daddy-daddy 

silence and darkness-no answer
where could he have gone gasped
travers not down stairs or i would
have seen him-ah there are the lights

  the hallway was illuminated again
travers ran to the door communicating
with the new section but it was locked
as he had left it a search of all of the
rooms revealed nothing mrs grover
and evelyn were hysterical with terror
togo ran up the stairs

  light turned off at switch all right
he said no find doctor

 no travers said grimly where
is the switch take me to it

  the switch was on the outside of the
building near the kitchen door some
one had been on the grounds and at a
signal had simply pulled the switch

  sam turn on every light in-the house
and mrs grover you and evelyn and
togo had better go to the living-room
where is mammy jane

 mammy appeared at that moment in
a white nightgown nearly startling sam
out of his wits

 here ah is -whats happened -
who-

  travers told the trembling negress the
brief particulars and as they all turned
back into the house he commenced a
survey of the outside of the building
his flashlight pierced the gloom cast by
the lofty trees after examining the
grass beneath the meter-box he ran
around the building flashing the light
in among the trees and bushes

  doctor he called loudly

  there was no answer-save the rustic
of leaves overhead somewhere along
the river came the hoot of an owl

  he returned to the kitchen door and
finding a bit of wire wrapped it around
the meter-box securing the door with
several turns

  he found the others in the living room
excitedly talking about the strange dis-
appearance of doctor grover mammy
jane was doing her best to comfort mrs
grover and evelyn

  its all right-its all right was all
she could say

  sam and togo stood to one side silent
-staring at travers helplessly the
latter glanced at evelyn finding that
oddly enough the excitement had hot
brought on another trance

  oh professor i cried mrs grover
we must do something john must be
somewhere in the house

  he should be said travers gloomily
have you been in every room sam

  yes suh

  well im going around again sam
you may as well call up the police and
tell them the circumstances ill be
back soon

he made the rounds o the house
examining every door and window
everything was just av he had left it
in his own room he had left the door
unlocked but nothing had been dis-
turbed in the doctors room however
he saw something that had escaped his
notice before a white slip of paper
pinned to the inside of the door he
took it down unfolding it

  in the centcr of the paper was a red
circle

 all the zvindoivs and doors were
locked-yet doctor grover had disap-
peared threats were made - and
ignored tracys dreaded devil cult
the red circle is taking revenge
jvho will be the next victim-the
beautiful evelyn read the thrilling
developments of this absorbing story in
february issue of ghost storied
magazine on the nezvs stands decem-
ber d you will find these new de-
velopments of tense interest

the doll that came to life

                     continued from page 

on the walls and the side of the room
farthest from the window contained a
table on which the childs toys had been
set out-everything she had had since
babyhood that had survived unbroken

  against the wall was a stand on which
was an enormous doll propped up be-
neath three lighted candles an en-
larged photograph of little doris hung
on the wall near by and some fresh-cut
flowers were in a tall vase standing be-
side the doll

 so you have put everything back
again where it was asked martinus
curtly of mr craven the whole epi-
tome of the childs life may i ask
why

  well you see replied the fake spir-
itualist i came to the conclusion that
the poor earth-bound spirit would con-
tinue to haunt this room until things
were restored my deductions had been
wrong but perfectly justifiable

  and these manifestations have ceased
now that you have pieced together the
broken fragments of the vase martinus
asked you suppose that everything is
again-as it was

he was of course speaking meta-
phorically but before craven could
reply there came a sudden crash in the
corner of the room we sprang back-
looked around us a shower of broken
glass lay on the carpet upon the stand
beside the doll the flowers lay scattered
and water was splashed over the table
that contained the toys

 my god whimpered craven his

teeth chattering who threw that
vase

  if we knew that replied martinus
we should have gone some distance to-
ward the solution of this problem

  my teeth were chattering at that mo-
ment i was under the singular illusion
that the dolls large blue eyes had taken
on an expression of intelligence

  human eyes i forced myself to look
again no of course it had been the
way the light had played upon them
they were just a dolls glass eyes

  i was surprised at martinuss sudden
cordiality toward craven i had been
afraid he would withdraw from the
case instead he had cordially wel-
comed the pseudo spiritualists co-
operation he had told mrs temple
that he proposed to hold a seance at an
early date and suggested that they might
all form a circle on the way back
martinus was silent for a long time-evi-
dently pondering over the case then
suddenly he began to chuckle

 youre wondering why i wanted
craven branscombe he asked me

  i was surprised i confessed

  i have an idea chuckled the doctor
again that cravens presence will prove
a powerful attraction to whatever spirit
it is that has usurped the childs place
in that room the fool thinks he can
tear down the shrine and reconstruct it
just as if nothing had happened as if no
consecration was necessary as if the
reassemblage of the physical elements
will call back the spirit as well sew
the head on a decapitated man and ex-

pect him to awake to life a fool like-
that should prove a powerful drawing-
card to the kind of spirit i fancy ha-
come into that room

  i thought the poltergeist when not
merely an extension of the astral form
at maturity was always an elemental
factor i suggested

  more or less right branscombe it
is a spirit of the lowest order though
it may or may not once have been in-
carnate but you must remember i am
always urging upon you that these
manifestations of the discarnate-throw-
ing of vases breaking of crockery and
so forth-are merely expressions of en-
ergy it is not to be supposed that the
spirit is actually conscious of what it is
doing it lets loose energy in the room
and this energy takes certain forms

  for instance a very dear friend of
mine once promised his sister he would
try to communicate with her after death
he supposed he had merely established
communication by taps and rappings
he was heartbroken to learn that he had
been pulling down pictures and wreck-
ing the furniture

then it may be the child after all

  i i suggested

 impossible branscombe no child
could throw a vase across a room re-
member that before maturity no human
being is more than one-tenth incarnate
little doris temples earthly residence
was the merest episode in the life of her
spirit all that remains of her is the
happy dream and the memories so rude-


ghost stories

ly shattered when the furniture of that
room was shifted no branscombe it
all comes back to cravens asinine ques-
tion who threw that vase

  i told martinus of the expression i
had fancied  had seen in the eyes of
the doll he nodded abstractedly but
made no comment

  it was two days later and before mar-
tinus had had time to go further into
the case that we had a visit from mrs
temple again she appeared in the
greatest distress

  i dont know what im going to do
doctor martinus she sobbed -and
dear mr craven admits that he is at
his wits end he was so sure that dear
little doris would be satisfied when
things were put back as they were but
its growing worse all the time and its
not only in that room now-its all over
the house my maid has left me

hat particular manifestations have
occurred asked martinus
footsteps up and down the stairs at
night-a mans heavy footsteps doors
opening and slamming pictures falling
from the wall and last night as i
lay in bed i could have sworn i felt
fingers about my throat my maid was
pinchcd black and blue too oh doc-
tor it cant be doris 

  no its not your little girl said
martinus have you been dreaming
dreadful dreams but i cant remem-
ber anything about them except that-

she hesitated

  that queried the doctor

 that i had murdered somebody and
was going to be executed but i dont
know who it was or how i was to die
she broke into hysterical weeping

  martinus made her it down and mixed
some bromide for her after a little
while she grew calmer

  i am sorry to be so hysterical she
apologized but ive gone through so
much what with my little girl and my

husband-

 tell me about your husband said
the doctor gently

  why it was just at the time doris
lay dying he was in texas and hadnt
heard anything about her illness be-
cause he was off with a posse he sent
me some clippings and that alone would
have scared me nearly to death

  a posse you say

 yes doctor you remember read-
ing about that man who escaped from
the penitentiary and shot his way clear
across three states-james oconnor
the doctor shook his head but i re-
membered the affair oconnor had
been serving a life term for murder
he had broken loose after killing three
guards and had escapcd at least a
dozen of his pursuers had been killed
and wounded before the posse surrounded
him in his stronghold there had been
summary vengeance taken the bandits
body was left swinging from a tree
riddled with bullets i recalled the cir-
cumstances

 my husband was with that posse
said mrs temple and he had written
me about being summoned by the sheriff
and that - with doris dying - nearly
killed me i was afraid i should lose
both of them jim and i have always
been devoted to each other and his ab-

sence is unbearable now hes coming
home for good soon and im trying to
hold out till then but after whats
been happening-

 martinus patted her arm sympath-
etically i think we shall be able to
remedy things mrs temple he said
suppose we come up to your house
to-night can mr craven provide a re-
liable medium for a seance

  oh yes theres mrs jimpson shes
wonderful said mrs temple why
she described my father perfectly and
gave me his name and everything

  get her to your house to-night about
nine then said martinus he turned
to me when she had gone we cant
use any of my mediums on a case like
this he said i imagine this mrs
jimpson is one of cravens crowd and
just the kind likely to attract the inter-
est of the late james oconnor

 you mean-you think its oconnor
manifesting in the house i exclaimed

  its a perfectly good working theory
and decidedly a probability he an-
swered

  you see he explained as we started
for mrs temples house if jim tem-
ple took a prominent part in the lynch-
ing of this bandit it is probable that
the fellow passed out with feelings of
intense malignancy against him and the
rest when a murderer is hurried into
eternity as you know he can hardly be
said to be dead in the sense that ordi-
nary people die cut off in the full
vigor of bodily prowess and activity he
is simply a disembodied entity just as
much attached to the earth life per-
petually rehearsing his crime and the
circumstances of his death and utilizing
every opportunity to use other physical
mediums for the gratification of his
earthly desires and for revenge

  but why should he have succeeded id
molesting mrs temple i asked

rthe fact that jim temples little girl

  i passed out almost at the same time
as himself established a rapport there
are rapports of hate as well as of love
i have no doubt that in an obscure way
james oconnor discovered this means
of at once getting into touch with earth
life and of obtaining revenge the emo-
tional condition under which mrs tem-
ple was laboring the fact that her hus-
band had her constantly in his mind-
you heard her say they were devoted to
each other-established the links in the
chain

 but he found the house occupied
the little spirit of doris guarded it and
as love is stronger than hate he was
powerless-till that fool craven took
the toys away turned the furniture
about and played havoc generally

  then when craven re-established the
shrine-well he had re-established a
road that was easy following for james
oconnor but if that mrs jimpson is
any good at all we ought to learn some-
thing one word- he cautioned me
it would be as well not to allude to our
suspicions as to the identity of the polter-
geist if they think it is the child doris
our friend oconnor will play up to them
and incidentally play into our hands

 mrs jimpson was awaiting our ar-
rival with craven when we reached the
house the interior was brilliantly lit

with electric bulbs of great power it
was easy to see that mrs temple was
afraid of the dark the childs room
in which the seance was to be held had
been arranged under cravens instruc-
tions it contained the usual curtain of
dark cloth strung across a comer to
form a cabinet and the half circle of
chairs extending from this to the further
end of the table that held the toys

 mrs jimpson was a common sort of
woman but manifestly mediumistic
there is something about a genuine me-
diums eyes that identify her she went
into the cabinet and passed into trance
with the facility of long experience i
imagined that the late james oconnor
would manifest through her much more
readily than the child

  before mrs jimpson had settled her-
self martinus took the doll from the
stand and examined it it was one of
those large mamma dolls with mov-
able arms and legs about the size of a
three months child the doctor handed
it to mrs temple

 please hold this on your lap and
under no circumstances loose your hold
of it during the seance he told her

toctor do you think this will

 u bring my darling doris back like
she was before she asked

  i think it vital that you should asso-
ciate yourself with this doll replied
martinus in his curt manner

 what doctor martinus means put
in craven blandly-i could see he did
not relish taking a secondary part in
the proceedings-is that the influence
of the mother-love will pass into the
doll creating a fetish

  thats one way of putting it said
the doctor ironically any way please
remember my instructions mrs temple
and of course you understand that
the circle is under no circumstances to
be broken are you ready mrs jimp-
son he snapped off the electric light

  i heard the medium breathing stertor-
ously within the cabinet she stirred
restlessly sighs came from her lips i
felt the tenseness emanating from mrs
temple next to me in the faint light
that came through the window i saw
the outlines of the large doll she held in
her arms was it only imagination or
did the thing actually resemble more
and more a living child the stiff body
seemed to be growing limp the head to
fall back into the fold of the womans
arm

  suddenly a whimper broke from mrs
temples lips

  it-its moving i it-oh doctor mar-
tinus i

  hold it i i heard the doctor whisper
in her ear

  i felt it move its too-too hor-
rible i

  hold it as you value your security
and your little girls peace came back
the answer

  she began breathing almost as harshly
as the medium who was keeping up a
low moaning sound inside the cabinet
i felt that cold wind that always accom-
panies such conditions chilling my fin-
gers i thought the curtains before the
cabinet seemed to bulge outward

  then i confess my nerves almost gave
way as i heard the sudden tiny piping
g ii  s t s tories



sensational
typewriter offer

voice from within the cabinet clearly

 mamina it cried-just like the
mamma doll but it did not come from
the doll-mamma

  i had thought mrs temple a hyster-
ical person but she kept herself in ad-
mirable control

  is that you doris my darling she
whispered with a quick intake of her
breath

 mamma where are you the voice
piped i cant find you ive been look-
ing for you im all alone

  here is your mother doris came
the doctors voice then to mrs tem-
ple youre not afraid of your own
child

  no no shall i see her

  not now the voice piped back but
f can feel you mamma

 a dreadful pause what was occur-
ring in the darkness how still it all
was even the medium had ceased to
moan

  how do you like your baby sister
doris said martinus softly i knew
by some sixth instinct that he was
gripping mrs temples arm to keep her
quiet come dont be afraid my child
come and see mother and her little new
baby

  again that dreadful silence my hair
felt almost as if standing on end some-
thing was moving near me in the dark-
ness suddenly a scream of uncontrol-
lable terror burst from mrs temples
lips

  thats all shouted martinus in a
moment the room was flooded with the
electric light mrs temple was lying
back in her chair in a dead faint but
still gripping the childs doll and it
was just a doll nothing more

  dear little doris always wanted a
baby sister said mrs temple later
but why was it necessary to deceive
her doctor it seems so dreadful that
she should not have recognized the doll
she was so fond of

  she had taken quite a little while to
recover from the shock martinus had
insisted on assuming the role of physi-
cian and on cravens withdrawing the
faker had taken it with a bad grace
and there had been something like a
passage at arms between the two men
before he withdrew with mrs jimpson

  my dear mrs temple if the decep-
tion comforted you surely it was justi-
fied said the doctor glibly

  but why did she not recognize the
doll-

  because she had been lost so long
you must remember time does not pass
oil the other side as it does with us it
is measured by the intensity of emotion
-and for your little doris years had
passed since she visited the shrine you
made for her

i knew martinus was offering ex-
planations that concealed some truth
he was unwilling to expound to her
but mrs temple appeared satisfied

  and you say i must keep the electric
light burning there night and day she
asked

 yes mrs temple close to the
figure so that the little spirit may never
stray again

  what a beautiful idea doctor she
exclaimed it is like a candle before

a shrine-a perpetual candle

  a good simile answered the doctor
so long as the light burns i do not
think you will be troubled with any
more manifestations but-once in a
while fuses blow out we must take no
chance of that to-morrow purchase
some large candles of the kind they use
in churches and keep two perpetually
burning in place of the electric light
after a year it will be only a matter
of sentiment until a year at least has
passed it will be essential to your
childs happiness and-he rose-let
me beg of you not to let mr craven
or any of your friends turn you from
your purpose

  nothing shall turn me from it she
answered solemnly

doctor martinus usually ex-
plained his methods to me soon
after such a case but it was not until
the following evening that he came to
me in the little study off his own where
i was preparing his manuscripts

  well branscombe you understood i
suppose just what happened last eve-
ning he asked me

 i must confess i was completely
baffled i answered i understood it
was oconnor you expected to manifest
not the child

  that was oconnor he answered in
tones that chilled my blood with horror

  that voice i stammered

  oconnor masquerading as the child
-of whose existence he had become
aware and that was no easy feat in
the land beyond death where matter is
so plastic branscombe that it may al-
most be said wishes are things that
is the real hell branscombe for souls
like oconnors-the inability to distin-
guish reality from the shapes that their
desires assume

  yet oconnor had pierced to reality
by the force of his will and that con-
vinced me that we had a subtle and pow-
erful enemy to deal with bent upon
revenge for being hurried out of life
by the hangmans noose he masquer-
aded as the child and it was only when
i tripped him up by making him think
the doll was doriss sister that i was
myself convinced it was oconnor

  i was thinking of the ghastly horror
of the discarnate life when a doll may
be mistaken for a child what fools
these ghosts arc and how true the old
race-lcgends that substantiate this mar-
tinus read my thoughts

 you must remember branscombe
he said gently that the dead can only
sense us through the force of emotion
they have not eyes to see or ears to
hear if the dead man mistook the doll
for a child it was because i had turned
his expectations in that direction

  well but-why i asked

 martinus drew up a chair and sat
down beside me branscombe he said
you are advanced enough to know that
the fetish is not a mere block of stone
or wood but actually contains the power
ascribed to it whether from an external
source or as the creation of the united
aspirations of the worshippers as our
friend craven said-i did create a fetish
but let us rather call it a luck you
know longfellows poem the luck of
edcuhall he continued impatiently

ghost stories

-how the fortunes of the house were
bound up with the existence of the crys-
tal goblet the drunken heir shatters
the goblet and the foe rush in and put
them to the sword

  yes i recalled it but is that more
than a legend i asked

  my dear branscombe did you never
know any one who kept a queer little
manikin on his desk which he called his
mascot

  i laughed as he indicated the billiken
on my own desk

  just why do you keep that brans-
combe 

  oh just for luck i answered

  what you have actually done brans-
combe is to shut up in that billiken of
yours all the little bothers and perplex-
ities and gaucheries that you want to rid
yourself of-the russian demon who al-
ways reverses your slippers the little
imp who makes you grouchy in the
morning the one that makes you shave
too high up on one side of your face
and so on well oconnor is in that
doll

  i uttered an exclamation of incredulity

  the practice of burning lights before
the images of saints branscombe con-
tinued martinus may or may not have
been designed to keep them from leaving
their habitations but it is a safe guess
that oconnor will remain immobilized
and powerless within the childs doll
just so long as there is a light in front
of it it is just as safe a guess as that
you will remain immobilized in your
bed to-night until there is the light of
a new day within the room

  but if this will of his is strong
enough to cross that light i asked is
that impossible

  not impossible branscombe chuck-
led martinus but-he thinks he is in-
habiting the body of mrs temples
youngest child and he will remain there
waiting for it to grow-until he finds
that his opportunity has slipped by
after a year or so-a year and a day
according to the conceptions of folk-lore
though there is of course no exact
period-his power for evil will have dis-
sipated itself and james oconnor will
be resolved into that limbo where he
will expiate his crimes on earth before
he gets his new chance in a new body

i have recorded this case thus far
from the notes i took at the time
martinus had engaged me to keep a
record of his cases and this was one
of the many that i attended in his com-
pany the sequel was a telephone call
from mrs temple about a week later
she announced that there had been a
complete cessation of the hauntings the
candles were burned religiously in front
of dear little doriss doll as she
termed it and she did not think it would
be necessary to trouble us again

  about two months later i was seated
beside martinus reading proof for him
when the telephone rang he picked up
the instrument i recognized mrs tem-
ples voice but i could not hear what she
was saying the doctor listened im-
patiently his face showing evidence of
extreme displeasure

  mrs temple since you have chosen
to put yourself in the hands of mr
craven again i feel it is impossible for

me to handle the case i heard him say

  there followed the tones of mrs tem-
ples voice martinus frowned and
shook his head no it is impossible
he repeated more colloquy then a
shrug of his shoulders the doctor
capitulated

well come right up he said as he
hung up the receiver he turned to me

  that womans a type of the eternal
feminine he said her husbands com-
ing home next week and she doesnt
know what to do it appears that
craven persuaded her once again that
the child had become earth-bound and
about a month ago she ceased burning
the candles and locked the door its
been locked ever since now jim tem-
ples returning and she doesnt know
bow shes going to explain things to him
craven has persuaded her to let him
hold a seance with mrs jimpson in that
room to-night but at the last moment
her courage has failed and she is
begging us to come

  have there been any manifestations
since she ceased to burn the candles
i asked

  nothing at all she told me that the
first thing thats what makes me afraid
that fool craven and mrs jimpson are
going to set loose forces that will prove
absolutely uncontrollable if that devil
can break through to-night-god help
mrs temple branscombe ive seen-
but never mind what ive seen weve
got to hurry i

  doctor i asked as we started sup-
pose that doll had been thrown into the
harlem river

 then branscombe oconnor would
have had full play for his devilish im-
pulses to-night he must be sent back
where he comes from-if we can do it

the seance was just beginning when
we arrived mrs temple did not
seem to want to open the door for us
it was clear enough that in spite of the
moment of reaction from cravens in-
fluence during which she had telephoned
the doctor she had fallen entirely under
the fakers control she announced
with a nervous laugh that there was to
be no seance after all-denied that
craven and mrs jimpson were in the
house until his voice came booming
down the stairs inquiring whether it
was us the doctor simply strode past
mrs temple and went upstairs i fol-
lowed him and she came up behind
still protesting

  the room was lighted but there was
no light before the doll and everything
was covered with dust mrs jimpson
was just settling herself in the cabinet
craven tried to bar our way

 this is an outrage doctor mar-
tinus  he shouted

 we are here by mrs temples in-
vitation answered the doctor quietly
we intend to remain

 mrs temple weakened i dont
know what to do she fretted one
advises me one thing and one another
i only want my darling little girl to
be happy

  doctor if you had the most elemen-
tary knowledge of psychic matters you
would know that every effort to attach
the spirit to earth draws it from its
heavenly reward craven exclaimed

it was on my advice that mrs temple
let those candles burn themselves out a
month ago there have been no mani-
festations since proving that the child
no longer haunts this house to-night
we propose to hold a seance to deter-
mine that all is well with her after
which we shall leave the pure spirit to
enjoy its well-earned rest

 go ahead said martinus there
will be no interference from either of
us but we propose to be present as
spectators you may be glad of it be-
fore the seance ends mr craven

  if doctor martinus and mr brans-
combe will pledge themselves not to
interfere i am sure you will not object
to their staying mr craven asked
mrs temple

  craven sulkily agreed

again we took our seats and the
light was turned off the medium
began to struggle and moan and thi
time i was conscious of a presence in-
describably evil in that room it was
like physical contact with something too
loathsome to have human form i shud-
dered i felt nauseated it was all i
could do to keep my place in the half-
circle i wondered if the others felt the
same all the while too it seemed as
if i was resisting some physical pres-
sure bent on crowding me out i
strained against the chair-heard myself
breathing hurriedly-felt the surge of
the blood through my body

 it came mammal mammal piping
out of the cabinet

  doris darling little doris mother
is here are you happy doris

  i heard the doctor catch at his breath 
as if about to speak-then he seemed to
think better of it i saw him outlined
tensely against the faint light of the
window-square

 daddy i want my daddy  came
the baby yoice

  daddy is here boomed craven

 now what induced the man to utter
that lie is more than either martinus or
i could figure afterward there fol-
lowed a tense silence then that evil
power within the room seemed to dom-
inate to overwhelm me my brain
reeled i was choking for breath

 a peal of maniacal laughter rang
through the silence and i knew there
was a body there-some vast inchoate
evil thing that seemed to fill the room

  a chair fell over the thing laughed
again and mingled with it came mrs
temples scream and a sound from
cravens throat that i cannot possibly
describe it was a cry but a cry that
seemed the embodiment of utter despair
-the cry of dissolution

 then-a heavy body toppling to the
floor and threshing it with its heels

  the light the light branscombe for
gods sake i heard martinus calling
but as if from far away

  we were both groping for the button
we struck our heads together in the
dark fumbled in the dark and at last
somehow got the light turned on

  the medium was stirring in the cab-
inet mrs temple was seated rigid in
her chair staring in front of her and
muttering the light of reason was
gone from her eyes on the floor lay
craven apparently hugging to his heart
ghost stories



the mamma doll with frantic grip

  but as we bent over him i saw that
the little porcelain fingers were fixed
in his throat like steel hooks so deep
that the swelling flesh was already clos-
ing over the arms

  craven was dead the fingers of the
doll had stopped the circulation in the
carotids completely death had been a
matter of perhaps fifteen seconds

the rest is happier than either of us
had hoped thanks to martinuss
care and certain suggestions made when
mrs temple was in a condition of
hypnosis and before she had recovered

her reason she awakened with no recol-
lection of that final scene in the drama
had she remembered martinus told me
reason would never have returned

 she was told that craven had col-
lapsed and died of heart disease at the
beginning of the seance and this was be-
lieved by mrs jimpson who was still
in trance at the time of cravens death
it was a comparatively simple matter
for martinus to issue a death certificate
to this effect and so hush up the facts

  jim temple returned to a house swept
and garnished but this time without a
devil in possession the impulse that
had enabled the dead bandit to wreak

his revenge upon the living had been ex-
hausted by that act and james oconnor
was carried far beyond the sphere oi
earthly passions the doctor burned
the doll in his fireplace when we got
home that night

  but the child-doris i asked him
where was she while oconnor was
masquerading in her place

  dont let us worry about her brans-
combe answered martinus its a
safe bet that there is provision on the
other side to protect the dorises against
the james oconnors

  then i added in any case you and
i have done our part

paun of the unseen

            continued from page 

seems to her necessary in the circum-
stances

  he paused to permit this to sink in
the faces of both marius and blood
were absolutely imperturbable though
marius knew that terrys statement
about his betrothal to lenore was not
entirely true and blood probably had
good reason to suspect this it was a
happy stroke however because it gave
terry a standing in this house which
he did not otherwise have and under
the circumstances this was vitally nec-
essary in order that he might be able
to pursue his investigations

  i have heard nothing about your en-
gagement to miss lenore sir said the
butler i am quite willing if that is
so to give over to you charge of the
affairs here but i will have to have
my authority to do this from miss
lenore who is at present the person to
whom i am responsible

  well if you can find miss lenore
said terry grimly it might solve one
or two things besides that thats the
reason im up here now-to see just
what it is that has happened to her
and thats what i want to know from
you blood i know you never liked
her-

  you are wrong sir broke in the
calm voice of the butler i never-

 i know you never liked her re-
peated terry dont you suppose i
could tell by your attitude i suppose
her appearance rather broke up plans
of your own-plans which you could not
carry out so well with a third party
around i heard about what happened
here the night miss lenore decided to
move-

tjow did you know that sir for
i l the first time a flicker of emotion
shaded its way across the impassive
countenance of blood or was it just
terrys imagination he was sure that
for a fleeting instant there had been a
sudden fear in the eyes of the butler
but if that was so it was gone equally
quickly

  never mind how i knew that went
on terry it is enough that i know it
-along with a great deal else that it
might surprise you to have me know i
know how pleased you were when she

decided to move and i know also how
pleased you would be to have her out of
the way

 i dont see how you can say that
sir said the butler impassively

terry looked at him significantly for
a long moment before replying then
he spoke

  it happens that i know that the en-
tire estate of martin grimm goes to miss
lenore by his will  if she is alive
he paused for another moment and the
air seemed to quiver in expectation of
his next words

  if she is not alive blood the estate
goes one half to the metropolitan
museum of art and the other half to   
to whom do you suppose he smiled
mockingly but the other kept silent

  why it goes to one stephen blood-
of course didnt you know that blood
how naive of you i

  for an instant the face of blood lost
its impassive character and became
livid

  how did you know that he shrieked

  there was a silence a long pause

 the man who called himself stephen
blood had resumed his mien of quiet
and calm ilis face was imperturbable
as though a mask that he held before
him having slipped for a brief instant
was now once more in place in the
silence his icy voice dripped it way
through to the two men who faced him

  i dont know that is so he said
quietly and if it is so i can hardly
see what affair it is of yours he
turned to leave the room

  and now he continued if you dont
mind i think ill go back to bed

  youll do nothing of the sort said
terry youll stay right here and help
us find out a few things that we havent
been able to unravel-yet

 very well sir said the butler
calmly

  marius and terry turned to an inspec-
tion of the room it was a large room
covering practically the length and the
width of the entire top floor of the old
private house and it was almost bare
of furniture terry torn between anx-
iety for lenore and desire to find out
the mystery of old martin grimm ex-
amined it swiftly

  leaning against the old walls were a
few canvases in various stages of com-
pletion and a glance at these showed
that they had not been worked on for
a long time-years perhaps in the
center of the floor was a great easel
and in one corner was a board dais
covered with royal red velvet-a stand
such as is used by painters in portrait
work for their sitters two or three
pictures hung on the walls and in one
corner was a rude bookcase painted
scarlet and filled with books of another
generation

  it was the work of an instant for
terry and marius to up-end the portrait
dais it was nothing but a wooden box
as they could see and was absolutely
empty there was nothing underneath
it and marius replaced it with a sigh
it was the first thing that had occupied
his eye when he had glanced about the
room

  on the scrubbed wooded floor the
blood spot rapidly drying glowed a
dark red and it was becoming momen-
tarily darker as it dried into the wood

the light in this room came from a
large window overlooking the street
and from a skylight the north light de-
manded by all painters they could see
that the skylight had not been opened in
years the iron joints were red with
rust and the rope that guided the pane
hung down rotted and unused marius
pulled at it and it broke in his hand
the room was high and it would not
have been an easy matter for any one
to reach the skylight much less to enter
or leave by it though terry and marius
considered this possibility

  do you think its possible inquired
terry

  marius shook his head

  no i dont he replied and there
was no time for such an acrobatic feat
anyway you couldnt possibly reach it
without a ladder and the ladder would
have to be so long and so heavy that it
would be quite a stunt to draw it up
after you i dont think thats the way
it was done

  yet they-or it-were in this room
i am certain of that and theres the
blood mused terry

  well if they were then its a triumph


ghost stories

of the spirit over matter because i dont
see how they could have got out-es-
pecially if one of them wasnt willing to
go and judging from that scream i
dont think that miss lenore was any
too anxious

  there were several old trunks in the
room littered with ancient paraphernalia
and these trunks they examined care-
fully dumping their contents out on the
floor in the hope that thereby they
might obtain some sort of clue to the
shady undertakings that they believed
martin grimm had been engaged on

there was nothing upon which they
could build even the flimsiest sort of
theory four or five suits of old clothes
were there clothes of the style that
hadnt been worn by men for thirty
years boxes of dried up paints several
ancient blankets a rusty hammer and
saw a box containing nails and screws
and clips and a book of newspaper
clippings these clippings were from
western newspapers they ascertained
quickly and contained notices of artistic
exhibitions in which martin grimms
paintings had been featured they also
found the uniform of a civil war drum-
mer boy evidently the one worn by
martin grimm it was full of moth
holes and had a suspicious stain of
red on it

  of evidence that could be of any as-
sistance to them there was absolutely
nothing and after another cursory glance
about the great bare room terry turned
to the butler blood who had been stand-
ing impassively by

  your late master was both deaf and
dumb was he not he asked blood

  yes sir replied blood

  but the footsteps here in this house
-he used to hear them didnt he when
he was alive-according to what he
said 

 i never heard them and i dont
think he did either replied the butler
quietly i think it was an hallucination
of his

  then how do you account for his be-
ing at the telephone as if talking and
listening when he died persisted his
inquisitor looking at him with signifi-
cance

  i dont account for it sir replied
blood

 but you must have formed some
theory about the matter surely it must
have seemed strange to you to have a
man whom you always thought to be
deaf and dumb-if you did really think
that-talking and hearing

 it was not within my province to
form theories i did not question the
doings of mr grimm i was the butler
here i am not a private detective
blood spoke without rancor and with-
out the impertinence that the words
would seem to indicate it was a simple
statement of a fact

 just what did martin grimm do for
a living asked terry though he knew
the answer to that

 nothing you know that sir he
lived on his income came back the un-
hurried reply

 always-since you have known him

 always-since i have known him

 and how long has that been per-
sisted terry feeling the futility of try-

ing to get any information of value from
this man who probably had so much to
disclose that he was careful to disclose
nothing

  twenty years sir replied blood
you came with him from the coast
didnt you inquired his inquisitor
yes sir

    has he always been deaf and dumb
-to your knowledge and has he al-
ways been without a business

  yes sir bcth-to my knowledge sir
replied blood calmly walking to the
window and glancing out at the already
lightening sky in the east

  have you any idea who the seven
is-or are asked terry

  the butler shook his head not the
slightest he replied

  have you the slightest idea as to
just what martin grimms connection
with-ah-them was just in what
way he was involved in that quarter
the butler shook his head again not
the slightest idea lie said again

  i know that mr grimm spent quite
a little time up here in this room went
on terry just what was it that he
was doing here

  once more the butler shook his head
painting i always supposed you see
lie explained nobody else was ever al-
lowed up here i myself came in here
to this room very very seldom

  he was painting you say said
terry there doesnt seem to be much
evidence of it he left no amount of
work at all so far as i can see

  the butler nodded i imagine mr
grimm was a very slow worker

there was a silence then terry
spoke he looked blood in the eye
and his tone was low but his words cut
through like knife blades

  i know that your late master was in-
volved in some illegal operations he
said i know too that you also were
involved in it-that you had knowledge
of these operations never mind how i
know he hastened to add as it seemed
that blood was about to protest his
innocence

  you see he went on -i know more
than you thought possible the word-
ing of the will of martin grimm is not
the only thing i know that you thought
i knew nothing of now i am going
to give you a chance to tell me what you
know and if i find your information of
value i will not call in the police he
paused to give this statement its proper
significance

  and if you dont    blood inter-
posed calmly giving terry look for look
his dark eyes like those of a serpent
without expression

  and if i dont ended terry i will
call in the police tell them what i know
and let justice take its course they
are aware of the fact that everything is
not as it should be in this house it
would take very little for them to renew
their interest in the strange case of the
death of martin grimm understand
me i am not interested in the police
he put in a little more kindly what i
am interested in at this time is the
whereabouts of miss lenore i want to
know just what has happened and is
happening to her and i intend to let
nothing stand in the way of my finding

out i regard it as a plain duty 

  for a space there was a silcnce be-
tween them

  blood strolled quietly over to the spot
of blood on the floor in front of the door
and inspected it critically no one spoke
as he did this finally he looked up at
terry

  if i were to tell you what i know
about this case asked blood -con-
ceding which i dont sir that i know
anything further about it than you al-
ready know-then what he paused
and looked enquiringly at terry

  if you will tell me all that you know
about this case and i am convinced that
you are telling the truth i will say
nothing to the police that is provided
of course that i manage to get in touch
with miss lenore immediately

  and if i tell you once more sir that
i know nothing in addition to what i
have already told you blood looked
terry directly in the eye

are you trying to say that you refuse
to tell me anything more said terry

yes sir-begging your pardon sir

  his tone was respectful but there was
an inscrutably mocking gleam in his
eyes terry knew that there was more
to be told he thought of lenore and
the tortured scream which had been the
last news he had heard of the woman he
loved and anger overcame him he
would shake the information out of this
mans throat

in a fury he took a step forward to
the man the last he saw of him was
the cold laughter in his mocking eyes
for bloods hand came up with the swift-
ness and quietness of a snake and in
an instant he had switched the light out

  there was the hurried banging of a
door as both marius and terry plunged
for the disappearing butler missing his
exit by perhaps a fraction of an inch

  damn ejaculated terry angered
that he should have been duped in such
a simple childish way

 something winged its way past
terrys head and thudded in the wall
above them they both started violent-
ly marius recovered himself first he
reached for the switch

  he snapped the light on there quiv-
ering in the wall was an arrow pierced
through a fluttering paper obviously
it was a message of what where
had it come from

  they looked around the room hastily
the window was closed and so was
the skylight the arrow quivered in
the wall above the door so it could
not have come through the doorway
and as they both remembered the door
had been slammed shut after the hasty
exit of blood

it must have come from somewhere
inside this room said terry mystified

  i dont see where else it could come
from replied marius whoever it is
is here now-and watching our every
movement

  they examined the room and were ut-
terly at a loss to account for the en-
trance of the winged messengtr but
both were conscious of a strange feeling
of being watched by an unseen eye-of
having their every action noted

that arrow said terry could have
pierced one of us as easily as not

listen there comes that laugh again 
there came again that strange far-
away laughter-that ghoulish glee that
seemed to belong to another world it
was somewhere in the house where
-they could not know it seemed to be
around them over them under them it
seemed to be without place-a laugh
without a body to emit it it was a dis-
embodied flat fiendish inhuman sound
terry and marius shivered and stood
rooted to the floor

  then marius went pale i dont like
that he said you are right they
do see us and they hear us lets
get out of this room

  wait said terry lets see first
what they say i always answer my
mail

he reached up and detached the ar-
row from the wall where it was
firmly embedded as though a man of
giant strength had bent the bow he
took off the paper taking care not to
tear it and there came to his nostrils
the same pungent odor the same un-
forgettable oriental perfume he had
smelled when he examined the strange
message that had come to martin grimm
on the night of his death-the message
in fact that had presaged his death

  a premonition came to terry it was
a feeling like a warning that he would
be better out of this mess but he shook
this off as the thought of lenore came
to him

  the paper on which the message came
was scarlet as had been that which had
told poor martin grimm where he was
to go it was printed with a brush in
heavy strokes the ink having crinkled
the thin paper the odor of the per-
fume was strong and seemed to envelop
both men as they stood there terry
holding the paper in his hand and marius
looking over his shoulder

  the printing on the paper was sinister

   mind your own business if you
 want to live another night this is
 the last warning remember i

              the seven

 terry said nothing for a moment
marius finally broke the silence

  smells like a chinese laundry ticket
what do you say marius asked
terry

  about what

  about this case after all this is
none of your affair i see no particular
reason why you should risk your life
in it

  are you trying to sneak away from
me again and go it alone-like you did
when you told me you were going to
bed and instead came up here by your-
self marius had a dignified injured air

  permit me to point out remarked
terry that you did exactly the same
thing yourself-and a few minutes earlier
than me too

  thats different replied marius i
simply had a scientific interest in the
psychic phenomena that appeared to be
manifesting itself in this house

  that may be though i doubt it said
terry drily however now that our

lives are threatened-

  i dont think we had better discuss
the matter any further broke in marius

as for continuing our investigation in
view of the fact that we seem to be

observed by-ah-something- he

looked around him warily but could
make out no suspicious element in
view of the fact that we have very little
privacy here i suggest that we decide
elsewhere on just what our course of
action is to be	

 terry nodded they turned to the
door

  lets go downstairs and see blood
he said

  he was answered by the low mocking
unearthly laughter that moved some-
where in the house-disembodied cruel
not of human origin they started
looking around them for the source or
the direction but could not make it out
it was distant yet somehow seemed
close it was far yet it was all around
them  at their elbow    behind
their back    fiendish hard past
them it floated and all around them
and somewhere in the reaches of the
house it died down and away

 in spite of themselves terry and
marius felt a prickly sensation at the
roots of their hair this was not some-
thing that they could control they
could reason it away in retrospect but
when it was happening it was subject
to no logic no reasoning a wave of
fear of the unknown swept over them-
an emotion they denied and refused to
give way to yet it was there what was
this cold laughter-the dead mirth of
some forgotten spirit was it the mock-
ing cacchination of some phantom

they turned to each other as they
had many times in the last few hours
now just what do you suppose that
can be asked marius weve heard
it often enough this night-not that im
getting at all used to it

  whoever it is certainly has a sense
of humor said terry drily he al-
ways seems to see the funny side of
things-though i dont see anything to
laugh at myself its the most uncanny
laughing i have ever heard in my life
i wonder what kind of a spirit it is

that keeps making itself-

 it is not a spirit said marius
there is no such thing it is a human

being-a living human being-

  well call it anything you like as-
sented terry but i never heard any
human thing laugh like that it didnt
sound to me as though it ever started in
any throat it sounded to me like some-
thing that was made up of all the ele-
ments that go to produce speech-put
together by some outside power or in-
fluence- he was silent for a mo-
ment as something struck his mind
some newspaper article he had read
somewhere recently and forgotten or
rather not forgotten as nothing is ever
entirely forgotten-but stored away in
some pigeon hole of his brain ready to
be pulled out and inspected when needed
he turned inquiringly to marius

 some time ago i remember reading
an article about one of the big electric
companies that stated that there was a
man in their laboratory who was work-
ing on what they called synthetic
speech it was a collection of delicate
machine parts run by electricity that
produced a replica of human speech it


ghost stories

was not like the phonograph which dup-
licates speech that had been sounded by
some human throat it was different in
that it spoke words that had never been
uttered it was partly explained but
not entirely as it was not yet perfected
do you remember the article

  marius shook his head no i didnt
read it but what has that got to do
with this

  nothing except that it might give
ns the physical explanation which we
are looking for this laughing now
sounded as though it might be like that

-speech that has never been uttered-

  marius nodded in that case then
there is somebody actuating the machin-
ery is that what you mean

  i dont mean anything in particular
confessed terry i am merely casting
about for some sort of logical explana-
tion of a perfectly illogical manifesta-
tion in any event we are not alone in
the house somebody is doing that

 i knew we werent alone anyway
aid marius there is martin grimm
-and his paid mourner

  i mean in addition to them said
terry if we can locate the place that

laugh comes from-

  it seems to come from every place-
from almost any place we heard it in-
side the studio upstairs before didnt
we asked marius	

  well maybe well come across it yet

 aid terry lets go on with the search

they searched systematically but
could find nothing it was now broad
daylight when they had finished with
bloods room and had had to admit
o each other that they had happened
on not the slightest clue they decided
to work their way down through the
rest of the house

  this they did without result until
they found themselves in the lower hall
just inside of the main entrance to the
house

well said terry it doesnt look as
though we have had much luck does it
no it doesnt replied marius

what now what is our next step
of course we still have the base-
ment and the cellar to go through-

  but before that i think we ought to
search one more room said marius
significantly

 you mean- began terry motion-
ing with his head to the door behind
which rested the body of martin grimm
and the professional watcher

 yes i do said marius i think
its very important - more important
than any other room in the house i
know it hardly seems ethical to disturb

the sleep of the dead but-

 the dead are not disturbed said
terry it is only the living who can
be disturbed the dead are beyond our
reach he paused for a moment but
we dont seem to he beyond theirs if-

they listened at the door for a mo-
ment but could hear nothing the
weird chant of the paid watcher had not
been heard for a long time now it had
evidently died away with the coming of
the day or a little before they pic-
tured him alone there through the long
night with his dead plying his grisly
and forbidding trade terry permitted
himself a slight shiver which passed un-
noticed marius either not seeing or at
any rate pretending not to see

 terry put his hand on the knob of
the door and turned pushing the door
inwards it opened at once and he and
marius slipped silently into the room
closing the door behind them the
room was dark except for the flickering
of the candles which burned low at each
corner of the bier in the ccnter of the
room the shades were drawn so that
no light could enter and in the shadow
the unsteady candle light played queer
tricks on the wall they saw there the
figure of a solitary watcher he was a
little old man and he sat hunched in a
chair at the side of the coffin-fast
asleep

  he had four days growth of grizzled
whiskers and a curiously shapen head
which was partly accounted for by the

fact that he had but one ear the other
being not even a stump but having
been sliced off close to his head it
gave his head a strange appearance as
though it was out of drawing-and it
made terry feel as though it had been
drawn by an artist who would presently
rub it out and try drawing it all over
again

 he sat hunched in his chair head
fallen forward on his chest one arm
sticking grotesquely out over the arm
of the chair he was snoring slightly

  the atmosphere in the room was pe-
culiar-as it always was even when
martin grimm was alive there was a
pungent odor there-almost the same
odor that they had smelled on the mes-
sage from the seven in the weird
shadows they could make out that old
grimms coffin was covered by a black
silk cloth

 for a few moments they stood just
inside the doorway without saying a
word finally terry spoke

  poor old grimm 

 he is buried tomorrow inquired
marius softly

 terry nodded yes im not going
just yet lets take one last look at the
body

  he walked to the bier and seized the
end of the silk covering drawing it
back

 as they gazed at what was under-
neath their faces blanched and the
breath came through their lips in short
gasps they leaned forward in horror
at the thing that was disclosed to them

 my god breathed terry finally
it cannot be

 who-or what-was in the coffin
why not the body of old grimm did
terry and marius look down upon the
face of lenore was that why they
were so shocked was it blood him-
self who was in the coffin or was it-

the black spider

continued from page 

  ah well well see what we can do

 he drew a card from a silver case
and bit the end of his pencil thought-
fully he wrote something and handed
it to the man

  take this along to the dispenser

  anything else sir

  yes i want you to go to the first-
class saloon and find miss seldon if
shes not there the purser will tell you
where she is ask her if shed mind
coming to see me here as soon as possi-
ble you can turn in after that i shall
want you back at one oclock

 very good sir at the door he
paused and looked back er-i sup-
pose dr murphy will understand you
see he told me-

  langley took him by both shoulders
and pushed him out of the room

  ill make it all right with dr mur-
phy he assured him and went back to
his patient

the japanese was moving restlessly
and a crimson spot burned at each
cheek-bone he seemed to be gabbling
something that langley could not catch
clutching all the while at the white
coverlet with fingers like yellow claws
suddenly he sat bolt upright a gaunt
fragile figure in a borrowed pajama-
coat that was four sizes too large

  the box he said in english staring
before him with glazed eyes -they
must not take thatl they will forget
to feed it    the thing will die i want
it to grow  

 the doctor forced him gently back
and covered him

  your box is here all right he mut-
tered rather for something to say than
having the least hope he would be
understood

  the man struggled feebly for a few
minutes then relapsed into the vague
restless state in which langley had
found him

 there was a box in the corner a
square box of painted wood with a
double row of perforations round the
top it measured approximately a foot
square

  langley picked it up and holding it
to the light tried to see in he was
about to put it down when he became
aware that something was moving about
inside

  he whistled softly to himself

  good lord this then whatever it
is is alive too

  he set the box on the closed top of
the washing cabinet and stood looking
at it his hands deep in his trouser
pockets he had the usual scruples con-
cerning prying into other peoples prop-
erty but he was equally prepared to set
such scruples aside when it was a ques-
tion of an animal requiring sustenance
he could not make up his mind as to
the nature of the beast the movements
had been queer-similar in some respects
to those of a bird and yet he did not
think it was a bird he brought his
head closer there was a peculiar un-
pleasant odor about the box that both

puzzled him and-was very nauseating

  he glanced at his patient through the
mirror then withdrew a kind of skewer
with a polished knob that appeared to
secure the drawer it had occurred to
him that this drawer might contain a
supply of the particular type of food
that the creature required but to his
amazement he found nothing but minute
metal cylinders securely corked and
labelled in japanese characters and a
hypodermic syringe

  he closed it again and replaced the
fastening

he remained for some seconds gazing
at his own reflection in the glass
then deliberately withdrew a second rod
and threw open the lid

 he dropped the skewer and sprang
back a yard nearly falling over the foot
of the bunk at the same moment the
door behind him opened softly

  queer hairy claws appeared over the
edge of the box waving suspiciously
the box tilted then fell on its side and
there emerged-an enormous spider its
body as big as his two fists the thing
was black and hardened as he was to
jungle phenomena langley thought he
had never seen anything quite so loath-
some in his life a second later it had
disappeared and then he saw it racing
up the white-painted wall with a glis-
tening strand waving behind it that
might have been a rope it sought
refuge in a corner of the ceiling

  he heard biancas little gasping cry
behind him

  dr langley what is it oh isnt it
horrible

  he backed towards her his eye still
riveted on the monster

  its a spider he said calmly our
friend here brought it on board with
him in that box im afraid i let it out
and our problem of the moment is how
to get it back again dont stay here if
youre frightened

  he reached over and pressed the bell
i am frightened said bianca but
im going to stay

  splendid  well keep as far away as
you can it may start roving in search
of food-and some of these things have
poisonous bites

  but ive never heard of a spider as
big as that

 nor have i as a general rule i
prefer them about an inch long the
japanese gentleman on the bed however
isnt satisfied yet he wants it to
grow

  the girl stared at the yellow face with
its two crimson spots

 do you mean to say he keeps that
thing as a pet

  langley nodded

  hes been babbling about it a good
deal in his delirium he seems to have
it on his mind

  im not in the least surprised said
bianca

  a steward knocked on the door in re-
sponse to the doctors summons

  dont come in said langley find

ghost stories

me the biggest jar you can-one with a
large opening-and bring it here at
once

  ten minutes later the knock came
again and langley put his head round
the door

  thats not large enough she heard
him say then thats better i think
we might manage with that 

  she saw him cross the floor armed
with a lare receptacle that might have
been used for salt he placed a camp-
stool on the floor under where the spider
was crouching and mounted it gingerly

  a feeling of nausea swept over her
and she shut her eyes

minutes passed and suddenly she
realized that he was bending over
the washing cabinct doing something
with a towel

  get me a piece of string miss seldon
if you dont mind ive got him inside
she returned presently and watched
him pass the cord several times round
the mouth of the jar he swore softly
to himself as the knot slipped the
second time she bit her lip then went
over to him and put her finger on the
cord to hold it for him

  he dumped the imprisoned insect in
the cupboard and shut the door

  thanks awfully you didnt like do-
ing that eh miss seldon

  no i didnt i hated it but i like
to make myself do the things i hate it
wasnt really very difficult once id as-
sured my weaker self that the creature
was safely inside and couldnt possibly
hurt me it was nothing to what you
did

  no smiled langley but im a-a
doctor-and have to do a whole lot of
unpleasant things

  you were going to say a man  she
challenged him i dont see why you
didnt why do men hate referring to
themselves as men women arent
ashamed of their sex

  thats possibly because theyve noth-
ing to be ashamed of

  she moved forward impulsively

  im glad you consented to look after
me i know im in good hands i think
youre a super-man

  hey met that evening at dinner
the band was playing and there
were perhaps a score of people scattered
among the tables

  tired asked langley

  not in the least thank you i think
our patient is better already dont you
the doctor pursed his lips

  he has a grip on life that is posi-
tively uncanny he said were going
to pull him through you know i under-
stand the spider has found a new
keeper 

  yes hales-and isnt he a most pe-
culiar looking man commented the
girl with a shudder im told he pushes
lumps of meat under the towel and the
brute stands up on its hind legs and
asks for more do you believe that
no said langley firmly -i dont
but the fact that it eats meat doesnt al-
together surprise me there are such
things as bird-catching spiders you
know weve discovered our friends
name by the by its kamaga

  thats interesting i hate to have to

refer to a human-being as him or it
spelt with a k

   langley nodded

  spelt with a k has he disclosed
 anything more about the spider

   oh yes-whole strings of it its per-
 fectly weird at times youd think he
 knew you were there and was propound-
 ing his theories he talked this after-
 noon about japanese gardens and the
 infinite pains taken to dwarf thing
 then he spoke of himself its awfully
 difficult to get a connected story because
 he has a disconcerting habit of reverting
 suddenly to his own language at least
 i suppose its his own

   what did you gather

  she held her head on one side and
 screwed up her eyes

   oh that hes a sort of scientist he
 aims at increasing the size of things-
 everything thats his main theme he
 hammers away at that for hours

   the doctor looked up from the wine-
 list

   increasing the size of things eh
 you dont suppose he was responsible
 for the exaggerated growth of that con-
 founded insect

   she uttered a little cry

  you mean that he-

   i mean that a creature like that would
 command a high price at a zoo or a
 freak show i dont believe a spider of
 that size exists under normal conditions
 there was a drawer under the box
 which contained drugs and a syringe
 god  i wonder if hes doping that thing
 with something lies discovered he
 shuddered lets forget about it and
 have some dinner

   it didnt look very dopey insisted
 bianca it went up the wall like a
 streak of lightning

   you saw that

   of course i was at the door dont
 you remember

   i do said langley but id like to
 forget it if i really thought there were
 insects like that in the tropics id never
 place any confidence in a mosquito-net
 again

   bigger and bigger and bigger he
 keeps saying pursued the girl with evi-
 dent relish if he really goes on as
 hes started it ought to add a new zest
 to big-game hunting

   well drop it said the doctor coldly
 -if you dont mind

 they were on the point of disembark-
 ing at singapore when kamaga joined
 them at the taffrail he had borrowed
 a suit of clothes that almost fitted and
 presented the appearance of a sleek
 good-looking boy

 	good-bye miss seldon he said i
 shall never forget what you have done
 for me

   bianca crimsoned and clung tightly to
 the doctors arm

   really mr kamaga i had little or
 nothing to do with your case if you
 wish to thank anybody you should thank
 dr langley it was he who pulled
 you through

   langley turned

   oh its you kamaga glad to see
 youre better youre lucky to be here
 at all youve the finest constitution of
 any man ive ever come across come
 along miss seldon im going to take

you to the hotel-without further delay
they moved a few paces nearer the
head of the gangway and still kamaga
followed

  i am coming to borneo very soon
he enlightened bianca i shall be see-
ing you again

 oh yes mr kamaga er-good-
bye

  good-bye said kamaga a shade of
wistfulness in his voice

  she lost sight of him in the crowd but
felt somehow that he was staring after
her until the rickshaw had whirled them
out of sight-into the atmosphere of
singapores dust and intense heat

  infernal cheek  said langley what
did i tell you

  i dont suppose he meant any harm
returned bianca

 harm i snorted the doctor he
means nothing but harm cultivates
spiders as big as footballs and means
no harm damn himl

  the girl was drinking in the sights
and kamaga was already a back num-
ber in her memory

  i dont see that its anything to get
huffy about its a hundred to one we
shant see him again arent those black
kiddies just sweet  id like to take one
home with me

  you wouldnt declared the doctor
theyre like lambs they grow up i
can imagine nothing more unpleasant
than a sheep about the house 

dr andrew langley was din-
ing with stewart-magistrate at
mirabalu-on a high veranda with an
oil-lamp above and a pall of blackness
all round

  it was ten months since he had left
the baixlcoa at singapore and he was
beginning to forget that he had ever
had a vacation at all

 langley rested both elbows on the
rail and peered into the darkness

  he nipped the end from a cigar lit it
carefully and threw the match into the
night

  barry can be mighty hot-tempered at
times he remarked suddenly

  stewart was pouring out liquor from
a long earthenware bottle with a dutch
label

  i know he replied without looking
up it takes a good deal to rouse him
but when hes really thoroughly incensed
-then look out i but what made you
say that

  something that occurred on his es-
tate the other day jimmy has anyone
complained to you lately about barry
seldon 

 the magistrate shook his head he
was a long lean man with straight
clean-cut features and eyes that were
particularly blue

  dont think so has he been knock-
ing his coolies about or something
the doctor emptied his glass

  not exactly he kicked a stranger
off the plantation last thursday-kicked
him pretty thoroughly as a matter of
fact the fellow went away swearing
blue murder i thought youd have heard
of it by now

  stewart grinned

  oh what sort of stranger

  a yellow skinned blighter of some
education who met bianca on the boat
coming out-and tried to renew the ac-
quaintance barry warned him once
before

  the d o came slowly forward his
face flushed his fists clenched at his
sides

  i dont think i quite understand you
doc a chinaman-and bianca
langley glanced from the end of his
cigar to his friend

  theres nothing to get excited about
the fellow was washed past us in a
storm and one of our boats picked him
up he was unconscious of course and
bianca volunteered to nurse him until
one of the staff could be spared to take
her place we hoped to have seen the
last of him at singapore-but unfortu-
nately she rolled up here three months
ago hes japanese

  stewart started

  not kamaga

  yes thats his name you know
him

  by sight only hes taken over a few
odd acres that were not the remotest
use to anybody and put up some ghastly
looking buildings i was away when he
came but brown saw him nobody
raised any objection to his being there
-so we let him stop he clenched his
teeth some of these chaps have the
cheek of the devil if i hear the sus-
picion of a complaint against him ill
have him deported

  the doctor nodded sympathetically
my sole regret is that i was the per-
son who was instrumental in saving his
wretched life if youve got a couple of
decent packs of cards in the house ill
play you canfield for cents

it was close on midnight when a man
rode furiously into the clearing that
surrounded the bungalow and called to
the nagistrate from the saddle
stewart-are you up there

  the d o looked over

hullo wright i you look hot come
up and have a peg the docs here
the newcomer slung his reins to an
orderly and came up the steps three at
a time

  i cant stop a minute he panted
miss seldons up there alone

he grabbed at the glass stewart held
out to him and drained it at a gulp it
was at that moment the magistrate no-
ticed that wright was white to the lips
alone wheres barry

  the planter caught at stewarts arm
god-its awful we were up there
-the three of us the others had gone
and miss seldon had just come out in
her dressing-gown to persuade barry to
go to bed she was frightened at some-
thing i think and didnt want to admit
it before me i had picked up my hat
and was making for the dining room

door when a ghastly thing happened-

something black squeezed  its way
through the open window and dropped
to the floor in front of us

  he paused for breath

  well ejaculated the d o impa-
tiently what was it

  wright stared wildly and swallowed
hard	

  youll think im mad or drunk or
something it was a thing like a spider
only a million times bigger than any
ive ever seen

ghost stories

   the doctor glanced up sharply

   it was black you say about how
 big

   wright stared vaguely around the
 veranda as if seeking some object with
 which to compare it

   it was tremendous the body must
 have been nearly a yard long for a
 matter of seconds we all stood there
 paralyzed then i pushed miss seldon
 behind me and barry pulled open the
 drawer in which he kept his pistol the
 next thing i knew the brute had sprung
 upon barry and bitten him  

   bitten himf

   the magistrates face wore a puzzled
 expression

   yes it all happened so quickly
 he staggered backwards with an ugly
 gaping wound in his neck the entire
 drawer came away with his hand and
 somehow or other i managed to get hold
 of that automatic

   i fired at the thing of course and i
 suppose i hit it anyhow one of my
 shots found the lamp-glass and blew it
 to atoms that was when the creature
 was crossing the table and i aimed a bit
 too high the lamp flared up and
 smoked like blazes and through the fog
 that descended upon the room like a
 pall i caught sight of a shadowy horror
 clawing itself out by the way it had
 come

   when i had adjusted the wick and
 got back to barrv-he was dead

   stewart took him by both shoulders
 and shook him violently

   dead are you quite sure

   as certain as i stand here the
 things bite had poisoned him i got
 miss seldon to her bed sent in the
 black girl who looks after her and dis-
 patched a runner to the doctors place
 then i reconnoitered the ground all
 round the house but could find nothing
 i had another look at miss seldon found
 barrys pony-and came across

   dr langley reached for his hat

   the black spider he muttered star-
 ing straight before him

   a moment later all three merf were in
 the clearing

 they reached the veranda together
 stewart threw open the dining room
 door and went in the doctor following
 at his heels

   a cloth had been hastily thrown over
 the body langley removed it

   well asked the magistrate present-
 ly a lump in his throat

   dead said the doctor and put back
 the covering he rose to his feet and
 glanced round the room i must see
 bianca

  suddenly wright-who was in the
  doorway-raised a warning finger

  keep quiet a minute what was
 that

   above the chirping of the crickets the
 ceaseless hum of insect creation there
 floated to their ears the sound of a
 woman screaming

   stewart clutched langleys arm

   bianca

   the other faced him squarely

   rubbish he insisted its more
 likely some native girl in the kampon
 on the other side the sound came from
 a good way off

   he crossed the floor and gaining the

passage knocked loudly on the door
there was no response he tapped
again the others listening in silence
heard the handle turn

 jimmy wright come here both
of you

 the room was in darkness and the
doctor was striking matches feverishly
looking for the lamp

 stop just where you are for a mo-
ment 

  a light flickered and presently the
apartment was dimly illuminated they
saw an empty bed an overturned chair
and the figure of a black woman lying
in the middle of the floor

  the doctor turned her over

 shes had a deuce of a knock from
behind but shes still breathing we
must send somebody to her he looked
up are all you fellows armed

stewart tapped his pocket signifi-
cantly he was unusually pale and
beads of perspiration stood out on his
forehead

  then it was bianca we heard  that
spider has been back again he turned
fiercely on the planter you ought
never to have left the place

  wright spread out his hands babbling
incoherently

 i what on earth was i to do i
had to find you i had nobody to send
   i hit the thing i tell you    how
was i to know  

  the spider has not been back said
langley calmly

  but man alive shouted the d o
biancas gone dont you understand
that she was taken from here

  i know- but not by the black spider
the spiders master is the perpetrator of
this fresh outrage

  both men stared at him incredulously
  the spiders master what in the

name of heaven-

  i havent time to explain it all to you
now weve got to find our mounts and
ride like the devil wright youd bet-
ter round up the estate watchmen and a
couple of dozen reliable coolies and
bring them across after us then send
for stewarts men i want you fellows
to be prepared to fire the scrub do you
understand 

  the planter nodded grimly

  ill fix that all right where are
they to go

 to kamagas place i want them to
surround it and await instructions

  the magistrates fingers were moving
nervously and his forehead was deeply
furrowed

  kamagas place what on earth has
that blighter to do with black spiders

  everything said langley he
breeds em poor old barry has been
the victim of one of his ghastly experi-
ments no im not mad old man i
know what im talking about come
on

   they rode into the night taking an
easterly direction through the rubber
trees

a pale moon bathed the hillside in
yellow light a fresh breeze from the
sea rustled the leafy branches overhead
and from the strip of jungle at the foot
of the slope a hornbill shrieked

a whole regiment to tackle one jap
shouted stewart suddenly

im not afraid of kamaga returned
the doctor if he was all we had to
contend with i shouldnt worry

sue of september went to

mildred honkomp

some one will collect
the awards for opinions
on this issue why not you

  they galloped down a steep incline
and onto the flat land again the doc-
tor ducked to avoid a branch and swung
himself to the ground

theres a fence of some sort here i
noticed it when i came past last week

   the magistrate joining him flashed
an electric torch on a high wall of
painted stakes set closely together

  he didnt mean anybody to get in
here 

   or out  added langley as he moved
off to the right

   theres a light up there said the
d o peering through

   and a gate here its padlocked on
the inside we shall have to break it
down

 they had found a stake and were
wrenching off palings when stewart
turned and looked back

  his eyes had long grown accustomed
to the darkness of this lone glade where
even the moons rays scarcely pene-
trated

  what he saw there behind him froze
the blood in his veins he dropped to
his knees pulling his companion after
him as a black horror-crawling pain-
fully on five of its eight legs-crept from
the trees and scaled the fence barely ten
feet from them they heard it drop on
the other side

  god exclaimed stewart its in-
credible 

  langley had picked up the pole again

  its interesting to know that spiders
have a homing instinct he muttered
kamaga must have taken it there in
some way-and let it loose we can get
through here

  they clambered through on foot leav-
ing their mounts tethered by the trees

  there was a broad moss-covered track
on the far side negotiating this they
made for a solitary light that showed
ahead then slowed down to a brisk walk-
ing pace as the first belt of outbuildings
emerged from the shadows

stewart went first up the crazy lad-
der and pushed the door wide open
there was a strip of matting across the
floor a japanese stool and a piece of
low furniture like a desk without legs

 as the englishmen entered kamaga
-clad in a white kimono that was guilt-
less of embroidery-came softly through
a curtained aperture and stood before
them

  langley had him covered

  the games up kamaga he jerked
out put up your hands do you hear
me

  the japanese raised his arms slowly

  good evening gentlemen he said
quietly you have doubtless good rea-
son for breaking your way into my
home i shall be interested to learn
your motive

  kamaga interposed the doctor i
saved your life on the batilcoa we
want you to tell us where you have
taken miss seldon

  stewarts finger hooked round the
trigger of his automatic restrained itself
with difficulty

  kamaga blinked

  the lady has disappeared

  the magistrates anger boiled over

  i cant stand this keep this black-
guard here doc im going to search
this place

  oh ill look out for myself

  he plunged through the curtains

  langley opened his case with one hand
struck a vesta on his shoe and lit a
cigarette

  its no use beating about the bush
kamaga he told his prisoner i know
everything

  the mans face betrayed no sign of
emotion

  indeed

  i am referring to the black spider
you spoke of it in your delirium you
wanted it to grow-and grow-and grow
we know now kamaga that it as
grovm keep your hands above your
head you yellow devil

  a cry came from within

  doctor 

  hullo

 bring kamaga here make him walk
in front of you and dont take your eyes
off him for a second

  langley pointed to the curtains

 get a move on he said curtly
kamaga obeyed

he was on the point of passing through
when the doctor caught the cur-
tains up and ripped the material from
the rod that held it suspended he was
taking no chances

  he found himself in a long narrow
apartment stocked with appliances and
glass jars stewart had his back to
them gazing down a broad passageway
to a room beyond the door of which
stood open there was an oil lamp in a
bracket and its light was sufficient to
reveal to the doctors horrified gaze a
menagerie of the most revolting speci-
mens that it had ever been his fortune
to encounter

  he saw tier upon tier of little square
cages each  numbered and ticketcd and
containing specimens of insects of every
sort and description greatly magnified
a blue fly as big as his hand-a centi-
pede like a serpent that kept up a cease-
less race to the roof of its prison only
to drop to the floor and begin again-a
moth with closed wings which when
opened must have covered a couple of
feet from tip to tip-giant ants-beetles
-gnats   

  at the far side of the room beyond
there was a bed completely screened by
mosquito-curtains hung from a wooden
ring fixed to the ceiling

 i want kamaga to tell me who is
sleeping in that bed said the magis-
trate

  the japanese did not reply

  why dont you go and see for your-
self asked langley

  for answer the d o stepped aside
revealing the form of a second enor-
mous spider-a quarter of the size of
the one that had poisoned barry-
crouching on the inner side of the open-
ing a metal collar round its middle and
a long chain stretching from it to a
staple in the wall the creature had
four eyes with great hairy flaps over
them like lids that kept lifting

 shove kamaga in here suggested
stewart it may help him to find his
tongue

  he caught one of the uplifted arms
and began pulling the japanese towards
the doorway on the very threshold
kamaga gave an unearthly scream

ghos t stories

 oh no it will kill me i am not
ready   

  his gaze shot to the ceiling and fol-
lowing it the magistrate saw an enor-
mous metal syringe hanging in a sort
of cradle over a zinc tank

 we dont want you to be ready
kamaga he said mr seldon wasnt
ready when you let your vile creation
loose on him come on my friend in
you go

 the man had struggled to his knees
and hung limply like a sack

  stop he screamed i will tell you
i will tell you everything the english
lady is in there she is tied but i have
not harmed her no closer    oh no
closer  it can reach   

 stewart threw him back towards the
doctor and hooked down the syringe
he gave it an experimental pump up and
down then dipped its nozzle in the fluid
in the tank and drew out the handle
until it appeared to be full

 whats that demanded langley
suspiciously

  dont know said the other dope
for the spider i fancy isnt it kam-
aga 

  kamaga inclined his head

  he squirted a steady shower of drops
at the brutes head

  presently as he watched it anxiously
the flaps drooped and did not come up
again-the legs drew gradually closer
to the body and before the doctor could
intervene the magistrate had passed it
on his way to the bed

  langleys eyes were turned from the
japanese for the fraction of a second
but in that short space kamaga found
time to act  a cloth-snatched from
the top of a case-fell over the doctors
head completely enveloping him he
threw it off after a brief struggle to find
the tank overturned flooding the passage
with a sickly sweet-smelling fluid
every cage was open and kamaga was
disappearing through the farthest door-
way

  the shot he fired after him must have
missed by a hairs breadth-and kamaga
was gone

the doctor was left amid a host of
crawling buzzing fluttering horrors
with stewart-unconscious of anything
except that he held bianca in his arms-
coming towards him

  its all right doc ive got her

  langley brought his boot down heav-
ily on something and yelled at the top
of his voice

 is there a way out through that
room 

  no its a cul-de-sac

  then run for it for all youre worth
kamagas slipped me and his entire
menageries loose

  by a miracle they got through lang-
ley declared afterwards that they owed
their escape in this instance to the fumes
of the chemical kamaga had overturned
to prevent them from employing it

  they were in the open again with the
door of the house shut securely behind
them

  we must go warily said the doctor
ive an idea at the back of my head that
we havent finished with kamaga

ghost stories

  may i try and walk please

the sound of her voice sent a pleasur-
able thrill coursing through stewarts
being he lowered her feet gently to
the ground but still held her supported
you feel all right now

  oh yes i think so im stiff of
course but thats all she rubbed her
eyes what a horrible nightmare it
seems to have been going on for years
 cant imagine how you found me did
you hear me scream or did the doctor
guess 

  both said langley try and walk
a few steps thats splendid now try
again keep moving your legs as if you
were marking time he pointed sud-
denly towards the huts look jimmy
there he goes hes making for the
path

  i cant see anything who was it
kamaga hes thrown open the
doors heaven knows whats hidden be-
hind them bianca weve got to run
for it youd better hang on to both of
us f you find yourself falling yell out
-and well carry you

 they had gone twenty yards when
bianca screamed

 look look cant you see them
in that patch of moonlight spiders
spiders hundreds of them

 both men glanced back the entire
place seemed alive with them stewart

swept the girl from her feet and they
raced headlong for the gate

 kamaga was out of pistol-shot but
they appeared to be gaining on him
his white kimono clearly visible among
the trees suddenly he halted stared
round him in bewilderment and began
coming back towards them

a voice from the direction of the fence
indicated clearly why he had turned
stewart are you up there stewart
the magistrate paused and bellowed
back

  were coming now tell them to fire
the forest look out for miss seldon
im sending her on ahead he released
the girl again bianca he told her
the gate is immediately in front of
you and wrights waiting for you down
there i want you to go there-alone
are you afraid

  she looked straight up at him

  i am afraid jimmy she whispered
-but im going

  he found time for a single sentence
more

 im glad it was i who found you-
and not the others ill tell you why-
some day

 im glad it was you jimmy she
said-and was gone

shes a wonderful little woman
jimmy what are we going to do now
the magistrate started moving off

at a brisk pace through the trees

 try and secure kamaga-dead or
alive-before the fire gets a good hold
can you see which way lies taken
yes hes over there to the left
wed better split up and endeavor to
corner him

it was ten minutes before stewart had
his quarry in range and he fired wide
to make him aware of the fact langley
appeared on the other side

  the japanese faced them placidly a
knife balanced on the tips of his fingers
he allowed them to approach within a
few feet of him then touched the naked
blade with his lips

  you will allow me the privilege of an
honorable death gentlemen
honorable be damned said stewart
langley touched his sleeve

  he means hari-kari better let him
do it itll save a lot of trouble

  and then a peculiar thing happened
a black mass dropped suddenly from
the tree above them smothering kamaga
with its enormous bulk

  both men started backward

  the black spider gasped the d 
they fled down the slope with kam-
agas unearthly cry ringing in their ears
and a belt of flame threatening to en-
circle them-and not once did they look
back

they uho play idith sacred things

                                      continued from page 

slap on the back to brace him up now

  dont let the thought of death ever
trouble you old man i said of
course you dont want to lose your wife
but remerrbcr what i told you all
life is spirit death is a happy state
spirits tell us through their various
ways of communicating with us that the
next world is a happy one there is no
pain no thought of economic progress
they pick and choose their associates

  fact is my friend a man lives this
life here on earth only t improve his
mind so that he will derive better bene-
fits from the next if any one of us
were to pass on right now at this
moment wed be far better off this
that im telling you is recorded by sir
arthur conan doyle sir oliver lodge
and other able reputable men all over
the globe

for another hour i talked to him
along this line and when he rose to
leave me he was most profuse in his
thanks you have opened my eyes to
a new line of thought he said may-
be now ill be able to handle things more
intelligently a thousand thanks to
you and with that he left

  if i had had any inkling of the terri-
ble aftermath of that evenings talk i
would have kept jennings locked up in
my house against all statute law-even
if i had to use brute force to do it but
how was i to know

  the following day i thought over all
that jennings had said i tried to figure
out a way to help him a way that would

be human and material but it came to
nothing then i turned to the viewpoint
of the spiritual but the result was the
same nothing could be done i real-
ized until i knew more about his case

 the next afternoon i went over to
call on jennings wife i was going for
no outward reason except to get better
acquainted in reality my object was
to sec for myself what sort of woman
she was and learn if possible what
could cause jennings continued mental
upset if the cause could be remedied
in a human way i would see it if i
found the condition to be one of evil
spirit influence-i at least would know
it and be able to advise him how to
fight it

 naturally i would make no refer-
ence to jennings call of the night be-
fore and i would give no indication that
he had told me any of his affairs

 a maid showed me into a well-fur-
nished reception room on the lower floor
this was my first step inside his house
and i was agreeably surprised to find
the place well furnished in a conven-
tional way with easy chairs brass
buddhas and other charms on the man-
tel oil landscapes and girls heads in
attractive frames adorning the walls

  good afternoon mrs jennings i
said as she entered she was a tall
slender woman of rather nervous make-
up i noted with a swift glance that
she wore a lacy negligee and was carry-
ing a lighted cigarette i trust you
will pardon this intrusion but i felt
that such elose neighbors as we are

should know each other better

  she knitted her brows and for a mo
ment stood staring at me she gave
me no handshake of welcome didnt in-
vite me to sit down it seemed as if she
were trying to probe what i had said
to find some ulterior motive

  i think i know you pretty well now
mr kirkland she replied taking a
deep inhalation from her cigarette ed
has told me he met you often on the
train going in youre something of a
spiritualist arent you a faint smile
puckered the corners of her mouth
youll have to excuse my saying so
but you came at a most inopportune
time

  no further hint was necessary my
apologies mrs jennings perhaps you
and mr jennings will join me at dinner
some night soon

  perhaps good day mr kirkland
and before i had reached the outer door
she had turned and was mounting the
stairs

  this was something i didnt expect
her voice had been hard in tone and
there was a hint of scorn in her man-
ner if jennings hadnt told me there
was something of an evil spiritual na-
ture in her i would have said that mrs
jennings manner indicated she was hid-
ing some guilty secret and in sending
me away summarily that she was pro-
tecting that secret from discovery by
any outsider

  well maybe i had gone too far in my
effort to help after all jennings af-
fairs were his affairs not mine

 matters went along in their even
way so far as the jennings house-
hold was concerned for about a week
i took a closer interest in them than
formerly of course but i could find no
lead that would solve the problem of
jennings spirit visitations or the vam-
pirish thing that was wasting them
away

there came a night when i was
awakened out of a sound sleep by
voices i made out a mans voice and a
womans they came it seemed from
my bedside not three feet away

 instantly i was wide awake the
first thought that flashed through my
mind was that here was jennings ghost
come to spread its evil influence over
me terrified holding my breath lest i
disturb the specter i waited then
reason came

 the voices were human enough and
they came from the head of a garage
driveway that separates jennings house
from mine in my first moment of
wakefulness i attached a supernatural
meaning to them and what i heard
those next few seconds gave me a shock
i wasnt prepared for

 no-no jim for the hundredth
time no this was the womans voice
for a year now youve made that pro-
posal and you know i cant run away
with you if ed were anything but the
poor sap he is-id go in a minute you
know that darling but i cant bear to
hurt him that way hes too good hes
too thoughtful and kind thats just
the trouble i couldnt be happy with
his misery on my mind always no
jim i cant go away with you now
dont speak of it again

  but sweetheart you love me dont
you it was a thick voice-husky i
could tell that the man had been drink-
ing

  you know it

 then i dont see-

  of course you dont you cant but
i do and thats whats keeping me
thin-thinking of ed but nothing can
keep me from loving you can it
darling

 there came a pause then

  run along now good night prec-
ious till tomorrow

  i heard a measured footstep a door
slamming shut-silence

 the woman was mrs jennings i
couldnt be mistaken for the same
hard tone of voice she had used with
me i heard coming through the dark
that night but who was jim

it didnt matter much of jennings
problem was clear to me now poor
devil it was the old story of the
steady regular husband being too con-
sistently good for a cigarette-smoking
drink-loving wife

  but how account for the ghost the
temperamental upsets the woman had
were clear now i suppose the situation
of living with an adoring husband and
loving some one else was at times in-
tolerable to her and she blew up occa-
sionally because she couldnt help her-
self but the phantom that-haunted ed

jennings-

  it was some time before i fell asleep
again and when i awakened the bright

sunlight was flooding through my win-
dow i looked at my watch and saw
that it was nearly half-past seven-
barely time for me to catch the eight-
ten

  on the train i ran into jennings he
was slumped into a window seat staring
at the ceiling

  hello i said taking the seat next
to him it was the first time i had seen
him since he came over to my house
that first night

  oh hello kirkland

  saying nothing else he resumed his
staring at the ceiling for a moment
 sensed that he too had heard the talk
between his wife and her visitor the night
before and was trying to make up his
mind what he should do

 howve you been old man every-
thing all right i asked taking no
notice of his preoccupied manner

  oh ive been all right nothing has
happened say kirkland ive been
thinking a lot about what you told me
he paused and a strange far-away look
came into his eyes all life is spirit-
i can see it i feel it after death
there is no worry-all is happiness
right i exclaimed secretly pleased
that lie showed signs of profiting by
what i had said to him

put before i could go on he had
u shrunk within hiijlself once more
and that far-away strange look had died
out of his eyes

  the train pulled out stopped at several
way stations then settled down for its
long run before reaching new york
these early inqrning trains made no
stops near new york being rated as
expresses for the twenty miles or so
just outside the city

  we had left the last stop and were
just gathering speed for the express run
when jennings aroused himself and said
suddenly no worries after death you
go right on living-always happy

 he wasnt addressing me he was
talking to himself i paid no attention
nor did i take notice when he spoke
his thoughts aloud twice more before
we reached the city no worry after
death all life is spirit well always
be happy

 he left ipe with a nod no further
word was spoken

  i went through the business i had to
attend to during the day and arrived
home about three in the afternoon the
day was gone so far as concentrated
work was concerned so i settled down
to read i selected a new book on
occult theories and collected facts-
written by an east indian and before
i had gone very far i came across the
astral body theory stated clearly and
concisely and giving at least a dozen
examples taken from life of evidences
that the theory is something more than
a theory-that it is actually a working
fact

  when the mind thinks the soul fol-
lows the thoughts i read where the
thoughts are there will the soul be
found and at times the thought is so
strong as to cause the soul to take visi-
ble shape the shape of course of the

physical body-

 jennings my mind focussed on him
at once here was the explanation of


ghost stories

the phantom his wifes thoughts were
so centered on getting him out of her
life that her astral body projected it-
self to his bedchamber to his front
doorstep it was this that haunted him
and she wouldnt leave him for fear of
hurting him

 i knew better actually she was a
coward she feared to hurt herself by
running the risk of being hounded by
conscience what a scrambled affair
that jennings situation was

  although i did not then realize it the
affair was to come to a swift and terri-
ble end that very night

 it was the dinner hour i was out
back cleaning the spark plugs in my
car suddenly my attention was drawn
to the jennings dining room which is
at the rear of their house behind a tall
hedge loud voices attracted me and
though i couldnt see i could hear
plainly what went on

  it started with a crash of china then
the voice of mrs jennings

 oh i hate you so  i dont know
why i ever married you no friends
no life in this hole-nothing three
meals a day mow the lawn on saturday
read the paper on sunday-and youre
satisfied get out of my sight before i
kill you

 the hysteria back of those words
made me nervous and there was some-
thing malignant about them

  but my dear i love you i heard
jennings say if you havent been
happy with me here you should have
said so

 the quiet way he said it wrung my

heart for the man

 love you i hate your smug face-
your smug ways is your blood made
of water havent i let you know in a
thousand ways this last year that i hate

you-despise you-

  i waited to hear no more it was too
much like eavesdropping i came into
my own house and closed the door my
dinner had been prepared by my house-
keeper but i had little appetite for it
after i had eaten i sat around awhile
in hopes jennings would call

 but lie never came he went that
night to a place far removed from the
busy world

 learned later that it was a maid
in the jennings household who gave
the alarm just as i sat down to eat i
heard hurried footsteps outside the
house and a loud rapping on the jen-
nings front door peering out i saw
two uniformed policemen they were
admitted-only to come out a few min-
utes later leading jennings mrs jen-
nings lay within the house-dead

  they had to pass my house to get to
main street and as they walked him
past my door jennings made them stop
momentarily while he glanced in at the
sitting-room window near which he had
sat that first night from behind a cur-
tain in the dining room i saw him smile
heard his lips form the words

  all life is spirit no worry after
death after death-happiness

  and for a long moment he lingered
eyeing the house the gathering crowd
couldnt understand nor could the two

officers of the law make out what he
meant but to me it was a kind of bene-
diction a kind of warped gratitude he
wanted to express to me then they led
him away

  they charged him with first degree
murder but his case never went to trial
poor jennings reason had snapped and
they put him where warmth shelter and
good food will be his lot while he lives

  from a gossiping maid the neighbor-
hood learned that on that fatal night he
found out about jim and the terrible
import snapped his reason according
to the maid lie had no censure no vin-
dictiveness only concern for his wife
and in his mental distraction he used a
pair of stranglers hands to send her
where he had come to know there is no
worry-all is happiness

  nobody ever found out who the mys-
terious jim was

  and for myself-logically i had rea-
son to take unto myself a share in the
tragedy for wasnt it i who had started
his mind to work on the channels that
brought him to ruin never mind my
motive results force me to answer my
own question with a positive yes
there is a saying that they who play
with sacrcd things know not what they
do there never was a truer saying
than this in he case of ed jennings
and his wife the result was terrible to
contemplate

  yet that should not be our last thought
in poor jennings hopes lies his future
happiness

  all life w spirit there are no worries
after death

idhat a tlldn sows-

                  continued from page 

presence of yourself or some sane and
-well somebody whose nerves are in
good shape would ease the strain   
the fact is-

  he broke off suddenly

  slowly he rose his knees bent hands
outstretched like a man about to grapple
with an adversary he warded off an
invisible blow and then closed with an
invisible foe

  the veins on his forehead stood out
-his breath came in gasps the flesh
of his neck was suddenly compressed as
by strong fingers someone or some-
thing i could not see appeared to have
him in a death grip

i glanced at roberson he stood
staring in terror he dodged this
way and that as though trying to get
hold of this invisible thing a thrill
ran through nte a chill began to creep
up my spine i found myself shivering
violently

  roberson damn you - help me
gasped forber his hands were at his
throat as though trying to tear away
iron fingers that were choking him
then he swung his right hand free and
struck the air but though i saw
nothing there was a sort of soundless
impact with each blow he grunted
perspiration streamed down his face

  forber had stooped- down now and
was apparently trying to lift something

whatever the thing was it had vigor for
he suddenly staggered back with his
hand to his mouth he appeared to have
received a heavy blow  the jaw his
hand came away stained with blood

  roberson sprang to his aid cursing
under their breath the two men stag-
gered about the room struggling des-
perately with their invisible opponent
presently they appeared to have over-
come the thing they were lifting some-
thing that struggled and they swayed
this way and that as they carried the
presence or whatever it was to the bed

  then a horrible thing occurred the
bed bounced-as though a heavy weight
had fallen on it i began to think i
had lost my senses forbers hands
were busy at the head of the bed while
roberson sat at the end holding the
thing down

  then i noticed that forbers hands
were bleeding little red marks ap-
peared-like those made by a dogs bite
he sought to protect himself with the
pillow his curses were horrible

  suddenly he looked over his shoulder
at me his eyes were bloodshot and
terror stricken

 for gods sake hardman come
here at that moment both men were
hurled back to the centre of the room
but they returned to the struggle and
again possessed themselves of the ac-
cursed thing this time forber dragged

it to the window struggling desperately

  open it whispered forber to rob-
erson but roberson fell at this mo-
ment and uttered a shriek of terror

  i stepped forward to pick him up but
something intervened something ob-
structed my hand as i sought to touch
him and with that forber fell heavily
towards the window while roberson
bumped to the floor-as though both
men had been suddenly relieved of a
strain it was as if my touch had ban-
ished some malevolent energy or in-
fluence

  thank god its gone gasped for-
ber i cant be sure whether forber
said hes gone or whether he used the
word it he came close to me he
laid his hand on my arm roberson
caught me by the hand

  you have got to stay with us said
forber very earnestly

  if you will kindly explain what the
whole thing means i said i shall be
glad to help you if i can but im dashed
if i am going to stay in this room un-
less i have an explanation

porber leaned over the desk still

	keeping his hand upon my shoulder
the next moment i was aware that he
had taken a revolver from a drawer i
looked at him his eyes were blazing
with fear and excitement i felt quite
sure that i was in the presence of two
ghost stories



 madmen who shared an hallucination
 that had in part conveyed itself to me

   but roberson spoke with more calm
 than he had hitherto displayed

   shall i tell him he asked looking
 at forber without waiting for an
 answer he said this thing has hap-
 pened before it began in africa on
 the night we went aboard at mombasa
 i was just going to sleep when forber
 started up with a shout i jumped out
 of my bunk and put my hand on his
 shoulder he was fighting something
 but as soon as i touched him he laughed
 and said it was all right

   forber interrupted by suggesting we
 should have a drink with quick jerky
 movements he fetched a bottle of whis-
 key from the mantel then he got three
 glasses and a syphon of soda i could
 see he hated to leave my side he
 poured out a stiff drink with shaky hand
 then he turned to me and apologized
 for his bad manners i helped myself
 and roberson did likewise we all
 drank raising our glasses with trembling
 hands

   though thoroughly shaken i could not
 help seeing the humor of three vigorous
 men petrified with fear and trembling
 at every sound but i was in a hurry
 to go i rose and put down my glass
 i stepped toward the door and found
 forber there before me gun in hand

   no you dont he said brutally you
 are going to stay right here you
 are a fine antidote for-for our troubles
 youre the best ive struck and you are
 going to stop with us for a bit i must
 have some rest this has been going
 on long enough i am all in im
 done

   he pulled a chair to the door and sat
 down heavily i pulled out my cigarette
 case and offered it to each we lit up
 and i helped myself to another drink

   as i passed the writing desk i caught
 sight of the telephone on the pretext
 of helping myself to some more soda i
 leaned over the desk and lifted the re-
 ceiver from its hook as i resumed my
 seat i noticed that roberson was sunk
 in sleep forber was blinking but still
 alert

   roberson is tired out said forber
 he cleared his throat this business
 has knocked us all to pieces the at-
 tacks get worse as our nerves get worse
 i need somebody around whose nerves
 are in good condition you are a good
 chap hardman you see how easy it
 was when you intervened you are all
 right hardman and we are damned-

 damned- to my amazement the big

 fellow burst into tears

 at this instant there was a knock
 at the door forber started up he
 opened the door a sleepy youth stood
 at the end of the passage and gaped at
 us forbers appearance bloodstained
 and dishevelled startled him

   well what do you want demanded
 forber

   the receiver is off said the youth
 and folks are complaining cause the
 bell keeps ringing forber glanced at
 the desk he strode across and replaced
 the receiver while i moved quickly into
 the hallway pulling the door behind me
 i held the handle firmly i heard for-
 ber dash across the room

   for heavens sake hardman he
 gasped dont leave us i

   i told him through the door that i
 would be back in a minute and stepped
 into the lift i told the boy to take me
 down quickly at the bottom i bade
 him call up any doctor he knew and get
 him to come at once

   then i dashed into the street

   at the end of st james street i saw
 two policemen chatting i went up to
 them and suggested that something very

 queer was going on at no - pall

 mall and that they ought to investigate
 my story seemed inadequate and the
 officers were not impressed

   i tried to improve on my first effort
 and eventually got them to come with
 me with due dignity the law moved
 slowly along pall mall the night por-
 ter had evidently fallen asleep and it
 took him a long time to open the door
 the appearance of the police impressed
 him and he ran us to the top floor with
 such speed as the antiquated lift could
 make

ghost stories

  i knocked at the door of flat no 

there was no response i tried the
handle and found it gave we entered
the little hall leading to the sitting room
was but a matter of three or four strides
the room was as i had left it-at first
sight then i noticed that the desk had
been pushed back against the wall and
the whiskey the glasses and syphon of
soda lay on the floor the bottle was
broken the bed in the alcove had been
violently disturbed and beside it lay
forber

  he was on his face his body was
crumpled up and one arm lay in an un-
natural position as though broken i
stepped aside to let the police make their
examination

  without comment the senior officer
turned forber over his tongue lolled
from his open mouth and his eyes stared
glassily at us

  i looked round the room for roberson
the window curtains that had been par-
tially drawn were now torn aside en-
tirely one of them hung from a soli-
tary hook behind it was roberson
hanging half out of the window

  we dragged him into the middle of
the room he was breathing with diffi-
culty in five minutes roberson had re-
covered consciousness but he was no use
to us he could not talk coherently
but blabbed nonsense	

the officer was admirably efficient
he called up a hospital and he called
up the morgue then he turned to me

  i gave him the story as best i could
he was perfectly civil and respectful
but i could see that he was in grave
indecision when the ambulance arrived
as to whether he ought not to send me
along with roberson to the alienists
im afraid i was not very articulate
the nervous excitement plus the whis-
key i had absorbed left me somewhat
hysterical perhaps

  however i was allowed to return to
my rooms after giving my address and
certain impressive references

  well thats about all i gave my tes-
timony next day before a magistrate
forber had been strangled roberson
had been knocked out by a punch on
the jaw he is still alive i believe but
has never left the asylum for mental
cases his brain gave way possibly
he is still visited by what i can only
call the thing

  

that was the story as hardman told
it at hetty delvilles dinner party
when i talked with him afterwards he
added a few items that perhaps throw
a little light on the matter

  when he picked up roberson at the
window he thought he saw someone
looking in but he was not sure and
the officer saw nothing it was a dark
oriental face with an expression of ex-
traordinary concentration when he
left the house he overtook in st james
street a dark-skinned man who turned
apprehensively upon him as he passed

  hardman did not stop but lie noticed
the mans hands were soiled and his
clothes dusty after he had gone twenty
paces he regretted his lack of enter-
prise when he turned again the man
had gone he had spoken one word as
hardman passed him at the time he
thought it was a mere exclamation of
surprise at the near collision after-
wards hardman seemed to accept the
word as sounding like karma

 i reminded him that karma is the
word usfid by the buddhists to indicate
the law that what a man sows that
shall he also reap if there is anything
in it one may surmise that forber and
roberson were the victims of vengeance

  this was borne out by one thing hard-
man told me a man he knew in africa
button-holed him in his club one day
after a few remarks about mutual ac-
quaintances he referred to forber he
spoke of a series of particularly atro-
cious cases of cruelty to natives flogging
and unspeakable practices an inquiry
was ordered evidence pointed to some
white man but the natives were reluc-
tant to give testimony forber was
mixed up in it but he appeared to have
some influence and was permitted to
clear out

  i dont offer this as a satisfactory ex-
plantation but if you believe in esoteric
influences thought waves mental sug-
gestion or hypnotic processes-it may
give you something to work on hard-
man would not go further than that

  it is guess-work at best

the specter of the ijellou quarter

became unconscious i asked him about
the whereabouts of tom tsings grand-
son who formerly had lived with him
he replied that he did not know-that
tom had not been near the house for
days

  not only through the tales told me by
the old man but from other sources i
knew that tom did most of his gambling
at a bowery resort operated by a man
familiarly known as black mike
mike was of italian extraction and very
swarthy-hence his nickname i had
met him and we were not unfriendly
knowing that gambling was as neces-
sary to the chinese as food and that
mike was accredited with running a
square game i had not had him driven
from the district

 he came promptly in answer to my
summons and talked freely in recent
weeks tom had played much at his place
luck had run against the youth but
mike had permitted him to continue
playing until he owed him  he
had done this because in the past tom
had always made good but this time
no money was forthcoming so mike
finally had insisted on at least a partial
payment threatening to collect on the

i	o us from tsing unless the youth
made good even this threat however
failed to produced coin

 then mike had taken the slips to
suing ium-better known in the quarter
as chino joe who long had been on
intimate terms with both tom and his

continued from page n

grandfather-and had asked his advice
the upshot of the meeting was that
suing lum purchased the i o us for
 cash and mike promptly washed
his hands of the matter he had heard
that tom had disappeared but could tell
nothing of his whereabouts

t knew chino joe fairly well he
l was the very prosperous proprietor of
one of the quarters best curio and jew-
elry shops and lent money on the side
i found him in his shop on the extreme
edge of the quarter he expressed the
most profound sorrow over his old
friends death and hoped that his mur-
derers would be apprehended and pun-
ished

 without hesitancy he told me about
the transaction involving tom he ex-
pressed warm friendship for the boy
insisting that his worst fault was imi-
tating the white gamblers he showed
me the i o us purchased from mike
explaining that he had obtained them so
they would not fall into tsings hands
he had sent for tom advised him to go
to some other city and recoup by honest
labor promising to hold the pledges un-
til such time as the youth could redeem
them

  he added that he did not know where
tom was but believed that as soon as
he read of his grandfathers death in the
newspapers he would put in an appear-
ance when questioned about bow
ming he refused to talk saying he

never had seen her or discussed her
with tsing considering her presence
in the old mans home his private
affair through quarter gossip he
understood that tom was to marry the
girl he had never heard of other
suitors

  i went to the restaurant of sam hack
one flight up over a curio shop i had
known sam for years-in fact had helped
him out of a certain difficulty with the
government which had made him my
friend for life since taking over my
deputys job i had renewed his acquain-
tance and under pledge of secrecy had
told him of my connection with the
police

 there were but a few rain-soaked
stragglers in the place when i entered
only a nod of recognition passed as i
went to a table near a window which
commanded a view of the tenement op-
posite and ordered a light meal by
the time sam was ready to serve me the
room was deserted save for us two and
we could not be observed by the cooks
behind the swinging doors

  i was still nibbling at my food and
striving to fasten upon the thing at
which he had hinted when a series of
high pitched cries from the street below
snapped me back into my surroundings
looking out i noted two or three
chinese huddled at the curb chattering
excitedly and pointing my eyes sought
the place they indicated-the windows of
the flat of tsing lai low
ghost stories



instantly i sprang to my feet the
pulses in my head pounding my heart
thumping and pressed my face close
to the pane for directly across from
me in a window of the murdered mans
living quarters stood tsing lai low-
or his exact counterpart-the glare from
the electric light before the house show-
ing full upon him as he stood silhou-
etted against the drapes that concealed
the room beyond

  it seemed as though his eyes met mine
full though i could not be certain be-
cause of the intervening distance and the
numbness which clutched me but as i
looked he raised his right hand palm
toward me and pressed his fingers down
the chinese method ox beckoning the
next instant he was gone-disappearing
into nothingness

  i jerked on my overcoat as i ran tore
past the befuddled officer in the tene-
ment doorway and bounded up the steps
three at a clip

  what a sight met my eyes there the
place told its own story when i last
had seen it everything had been in order
as my assistants and i had rearranged
it now everything was overturned from
end to end the killers had returned
again they had searched the place
whether they had succeeded this time
i could only guess

 how had they entered surely not
as before by one of the doors opening
from the hallway for clancy had been
on guard there quickly i ran from
room to room turning on the lights
examining the barred windows and rat-
tling the knob of each door leading to
the outer passage all were locked
yet every room had been ransacked
finally i reached the kitchen the cur-
tains of both windows were down i
jerked one up the catch was properly
turned and i could see the bars beyond
in place i leaped to the other and up
went the curtain that window was un-
locked i flung up the sash three bars
had been cut away leaving an opening
more than sufficient for one or several
persons to enter

using my flash i examined the sill
there were wet stains upon it un-
doubtedly made by the feet of those who
had entered i swung the light wider
and the means of entry were further ex-
plained the circle of light fell upon a
swinging ladder of silk rope the upper
end of which must have been fastened
to the chimney or some other projec-
tion upon the roof

  quickly i pieced together what must
have occurred the intruders were will-
ing to take desperate chances to obtain
something which they had failed to lo-
cate when they had killed tsing know-
ing we could not keep track of all the
yellow men of the quarter they had
spied upon us possibly coming and go-
ing as residents of the house until they
had learned where our guards were
placed and that the murder rooms were
vacant then knowing they could not
enter from the hallway they had gained
admission from the rear

  but while searching they had been
interrupted by something which had
frightened them was it the cries of the
chinese in the street or had they too
seen the ghost as that word flashed

into my brain i shook my head impa-
tiently no it could not have been
that

  determined to search every possible
hiding place in that flat before i de-
parted again i despatched clancy to the
hallway instructing him to see that i
was not interrupted unless something of
vital importance occurred then i set
about my task

  at various times in the past there had
been occasions when it had been neces-
sary for me to search thoroughly the
quarters of various suspects for incrim-
inating things i was thoroughly famil-
iar with the modus opcrandi and was con-
fident that with unlimited time at my
disposal i would be able to cover every
inch of die place so completely that
nothing would escape me what the in-
truders had been after was a mystery
but i was confident that it was neither
money nor jewels

  my search lasted for many hours un-
til long after gray dawn i hunted every
nook and cranny behind pictures and
hangings and under rugs i examined
the desk and all other receptacles for
hidden drawers some such i located
but the killers had been before me and
had emptied them i went over every
inch of the closets ripped open pillows
and mattresses tore upholstery from the
furniture i even looked into the kitchen
utensils and poured vegetables and other
foods from their containers but not a
single written paper of any kind did i
find

jihile striving to determine at what
uy point to renew my search i re-
called that poe and other famous writ-
ers when chronicling the thefts of fa-
mous documents had caused the thieves
to leave their plunder in exposed places
as the surest means of keeping them
from those who tried to recover them
such craft was associated only with un-
usually keen brains

 now tsing was a logician of a high
order and he might have tried a similar
ruse my eyes began sweeping the room
for a bit of paper stuck carelessly into
the frame of a picture or in some other
exposed place i noted nothing which
appeared significant finally i studied
the things near me upon a taboret at
my elbow stood an ornate covered
china bowl i knew it contained sugared
fruits for i had removed the cover in
my search still- reached over re-
versed the dish and poured its contents
upon the stand

  instantly i uttered a low cry of tri-
umph for wedged at the bottom was
a folded piece of finest parchment which
when opened i found to be covered with
a mass of small chinese characters
and in one corner was a seal stamped
with the tsing family crest-probably
made by the big ring which the wise
man wore constantly though i couldnt
translate even one of the characters i
was convinced that i had recovered the
key to the mystery-the document for
which tsing had been knifed he never
would have gone to the trouble to con-
ceal it so cleverly had the paper not
been of the greatest importance

 placing the document in my inside
pocket i left the tenement after order-
ing clancy to remain inside the flat un-

ghost stories

til relieved then i hastened to the
office of the police commissioner de-
tailed all i had done to date and showed
him the previous paper

  the translation of the document took
but a few minutes it was even more
important in text than i had anticipated

  briefly it disclosed that bow ming
had a fortune of more than a half million
american dollars coming to her at her
marriage-at the disposition of old tsing
-this money having been left to her in
this manner by her father a former
mandarin at his death but it ap-
peared that rich and powerful men of
the yellow quarter had learned of the
beautiful and wealthy girl in the seclu-
sion of the home of tsing lai low and
these had begged permission to bid for
her hand they had been refused be-
cause it was tsings wish that tom low
should marry the girl

 when tom had disappeared these
wealthy suitors believing their favored
rival was definitely out of the running
had resumed their efforts it was then
that old tsing had prepared a will pro-
viding for the girls future under the
guardianship of the leaders of the four
brothers at his death right here was
the nigger in the wood-pile

my problem then was to learn who
these suitors had been i realized
the task was well nigh impossible un-
less i could locate bow ming for from
no other native could i hope for assist-
ance

  then came the third night following
my discovery of the will i had been
in a fever most of the day but some
hunch-compelling though based upon
no reason-urged me to continue my
quest without let-up and though dusk
brought with it a furious fall of dry
snow almost as impenetrable as fog and
despite my aching limbs i headed for
the quarter floundering through the
drifts made me desperately tired so
after learning from the tenement guards
that nothing had transpired i trudged
wearily into sam hacks place noting
my condition he gave me a hot drink
pungent with native liquor then per-
suaded me to lie down in his tiny bed-
room

it was after midnight when i awoke
the snow was still falling ignoring
sams pleadings that i remain i started
for home for my head throbbed with
pain my legs shook and i feared i was
on the verge of collapse as i floun-
dered through the door to the street i
discovered i could see but a few feet
before me a man or two passed only
dark blurs identifying their presence
swinging sharply i headed toward the
bowery i stumbled across the curb
and all but fell i was in the roadway
in drifts up to my knees

 the dull raucous squawk of a horn
roused me i stepped aside just in time
to escape a cab then i plunged on
again striving to reach the opposite side
of the street but i failed to locate the
curb i twisted and zig-zagged but met
no obstruction i was lost befuddled
snow blinded-unable to make my way
across a narrow new york street the
thought was so fantastic that i laughed
aloud

 then right before me suddenly
through the falling flakes appeared the
counterpart of old tsing lai low as i
had last seen him in life though with
features set and frowning but i was
not afraid and in wonderment i noted
that no snow had settled upon his silken
robes or his flat-topped cap

  come he said the next instant i
felt my wrist seized in a firm grip and
tsing turned and dragged me after him
in a twisting route through the storm
on on we went it seemed hours my
feet lagged i could scarcely lift them

  then without warning he brought me
to a sudden halt strangely enough
now i could see quite plainly through
the falling snow we were before a
building old tsing shook me sharply
and pointed straight before us look
he said

 i noted two great doors-unusual
doors with many panels rimmed with
red i looked closer the doors were
weather-beaten and old

  then i realized that the grip upon my
wrist was gone i glanced about me
old tsing had disappeared i laughed
my addled brain had been playing me
tricks still there were buildings before
me by keeping close to them i could
reach a corner-maybe find a policeman
my eyes were closing i staggered
there was a wild rushing in my ears
the snow had gone everything was
getting black-

 when i regained consciousness i
found myself in bed in a hospital a
nurse bending over me i tried to talk
but she forced me to drink and again
i dropped off when i awoke i felt
better there was neither fever nor
pain only great weakness the nurse
told me i had been there three days
delirious most of the time a policeman
who knew me had found me in the bow-
ery slumped beside an l pillar and
had sent me to the hospital in an am-
bulance if i remained quiet i would be
able to leave soon-in two days per-
haps

  i remained quiet- all right and i left
in two days but though in that time i
thought often of the thing which had ap-
peared and guided me in the storm i
did not try to reason out what it was
it might have been a ghost or a mad
imagining of my fever-racked brain
but it didnt matter-then the only
point which possessed significance for
me was this the first time i had seen
the counterfeit of tsing it had beck-
oned me caused me to make the search
which had located the old mans will
in the storm it had led me to a place
which i would be able to identify by the
peculiar doors and i was determined
to find those doors any idea that they
did not exist that i had imagined them
never entered my mind

 from my home i telephoned the com-
missioner he was glad to learn of my
recovery and reported that no progress
in the case had been made apparently
the mysterious doors must be located be-
fore we could make a new start that
night accompanied by clancy i searched
every foot of the three streets constitut-
ing chinatown and failed to locate them
but i did not lose faith in their exist-
ence so before retiring i located the
policeman who had found me in the

storm and learned that the exact place
where i was picked up was in the centre
of a block of shabby structures a full
half mile from the yellow quarter i
reasoned that i probably had seen the
doors just before collapsing there

  the morning after i was at the point
almost with the coming of daylight
my hunch proved  per cent in less
than five minutes i had located what i
sought-a dilapidated three-story struc-
ture obviously used as a storehouse
however half of the lower floor had
been reconstructed into a shop which
was occupied by a tailor the other
half showed only two large doors held
shut by a staple and padlock in an
effort to freshen the front of the first
floor these doors had been painted a dull
gray relieved by red stripes

  from the tailor i obtained the name
and address of the -owner an attorney
in lower broadway upon learning my
official standing the latter replied read-
ily to my queries the place for some
years had been rented for storage pur-
poses to a chinese named suing lum
who ran a curio shop in chinatown
the mention of chino joe gave me a bit
of jolt

leaving him i hastened to the
quarter located two detectives on
duty and took them with me to the mys-
terious building

  still there i had scarcely completed
that business when i received another
jolt-word by telephone that tom old
tsings grandson had been arrested at
the grand central terminal as he was
alighting from a train

  when he reached headquarters-where
he greeted me like a long-lost friend
but betrayed no sign that his arrest
worried him-i had him taken to my
office and sent his captors outside until
i had interviewed him he told his
story frankly and quickly after leaving
new york he had gone directly to
denver where a distant cousin lived
his object in going-there where he was
unknown was to go to work in earnest
establish himself under the eyes of one
who knew both himself and his grand-
father and prove that this time his re-
form was genuine

  is chino joe a friend of yours i
inquired

  no he shot back frowning i tpld
him what the man had told me about
the gambling i o us thats a lie
he said joe hates me he wanted to
marry bow ming-

  what was he one of her suitors

  yes the most persistent he even
threatened my grandfather because he
would not consent that he should marry
her not once but many times he
even tried to buy me off then he
tricked me his friends got me to
gambling again i lost heavily he
bought my i o us and threatened to
take them to my grandfather if i did not
leave the city i shouldnt have done
it but i was in a panic i feared to
face my protector after i had lied to him
-and to bow ming so i went west
-to prove by hard work i was truly re-
pentant i wanted to earn money to
buy back the notes to- he stam-
mered stopped then buried his face in
his hands
  right then the solution of the case
appeared as plain as daylight chino
joe had not only tricked tom but me
what a slick heathen i swore to my-
self as i recalled how easily he had
duped me he had driven tom into hid-
ing he had demanded the girl tsing
had refused and announced he would
prepare a document which if anything
happened to him would put the four
brothers in charge of the girl joe had
struck quickly thereafter-killed tsing
and kidnaped bow ming but he hadnt
found the will-the document which
would have protected her from him even
if he had squirmed out of a murder
charge

  then came a new thought which sent
me cold all over food which i had
learned was being taken to the store-
house-was for bow ming telling
tom i would return soon and bring
about his release i turned him over to
the waiting detectives gathered three
huskies from the bomb squad and
started full speed for the warehouse in a
department automobile

  but we were halted as we approached
it by one of the men on guard he
was just about to telephone me chino
joe had just driven up in a taxicab and
entered the building he appeared to be
in a great htirry i cursed the chinese
in good round united states the in-
formation meant that one of his spies
had learned of the arrest of tom and
he had hastened to bow mings prison
to spirit her away or to force her to
tell him where tsing had hidden his
will

learning that the men previously
detailed by me had the place sur-
rounded-back front and from the roofs
-so that none could leave it i gave the
order that they were to move in closer
then at a signal from me which would
be a pistol shot they were to rush the
place from all sides leaving one of
those i had brought directly before the
storehouse door i headed for the tailor
shop

  its proprietor nearly collapsed at sight
of my badge but without explaining
i frut him in charge of a dctective and
with the third tore open the trap and
descended to the cellar our flashes
played on all sides over and behind the
great piles of boxes chino joe was not
hidden among them next we moved to
the rear the door leading into the yard
was securely fastened the chinese had
left by some other means-probably
through a passage leading into the rear
shack it took time but finally we lo-
cated what we sought it was a pas-
sage about five feet in diameter hidden
by a huge crate cunningly held by hinges
which permitted it to be moved like a
door

  instructing my companion to stand
guard at the entrance so that i could not
be interrupted from the rear i stumbled
ahead through the passage trying to
make no noise and keeping the circle of
my flash near my feet my journey
seemed endless then suddenly i heard
mumbled cries-the voices of a man and
woman gripping my revolver i in-
creased my speed  reached the foot of
a flight of rickety steps stopped and
listened sounds from above were plain-

 ghost stories

ly audible a man was shouting in
chinese a woman was crying then
came shrieks and what i took to be the
sound of blows

 i covered the steps in bounds the
door at the top was unlocked i was
in the hallway of the shack the voices
came from the floor above apparently
the beating had stopped the girl was
crying and pleading the man was re-
plying angrily i covered the flight to
the floor above speedily hugging the
wall to prevent creaking of the steps
such noise as i made was drowned by
the voices above	m

  i was at the door stooped and looked
into the keyhole but a key in the lock
a cheap affair of an old type blocked
me i noted that a bar which had held
the door fast from the outside leaned
against the wall then came another
angry cry from the man another blow
and a wild shriek from the girl that
last sent me crazy with anger without
pausing to summon help i placed my
revolver against the keyhole and fired
it was the quickest way to break in a
crash of falling metal followed the guns
report-then startled cries

  i	threw my shoulder against the door
it gave way the next instant i was
inside my pistol poised chino joe
stood over the cowering bow ming a
murderous-looking whip in his hand

 drop that i roared keeping him
covered while i helped the girl to her
feet the whip fell to the floor and he
crossed his arms over his chest

  what do you mean by breaking into
my place he stammered fighting to re-
gain his composure

  only this you yellow crook  im ar-
resting you for kidnapping bow ming
and-for the murder of tsing lai lowl

  his cruel features turned a sickly grey
at the announcement but he tried to
force a grin he shot a glance about as
if seeking some means of escape but
right then to our straining ears came the
sound of the police closing in-from the
yard - the hallway below - a dozen
points

suddenly chino joe straightened
up and shrugged in my country
he said slowly there is a proverb that
patience and a mulberry leaf will make
a silk gown you have the patience
you win but-you shall not take suing
lum 

  with a gesture as swift as the dart of
a cobra his right hand jerked from his
left sleeve at the flash of steel i leaped
to stop him but too late the dagger
apparently had gone to its mark he
stumbled and dropped as i reached him
then he coughed and for a moment tried
feebly to fight me off the next instant
the slayer of old tsing straightened out
at my feet-dead

 that about completes the story-ex-
cept that we did find dope hidden in the
warehouse though we did not succeed
in apprehending chino joes confeder-
ates

 as for tom and bow ming-they were
married within the year

  do i really believe that i saw tsing
lai lows phantom standing at the win-
dow that night in the yellow quarter

idere ijou born
in december 

         continued from page 
 strange vibrations of uranus this star
 was discovered in  and it has the
 quality of always doing the unexpected
 it upsets our judgment-makes us acl
 upon impulse-and as the sagittarian
 at the best of times is impulsive and
 inclined to promise more than it is pos-
 sible to perform the greatest self-control
 will be needed to combat the effect of
 these vibrations if your birth occurred
 within this period try to keep this in
 mind each day it will help you

 uranus gives brilliancy of intellect
 invention and originality he rules
 over electricity and radio and all the
 lajest scientific inventions the present
 age is called the uranian age because
 the world is coming more and more un-
 der the influence of this weird planet
 it is the star of astrology occultism
 and genius but it also governs all the
 cranks and eccentrics of the world
 sometimes it brings separations and
 sudden calamities

   if you are a canceranian born in the
 early part of july or a scorpion born
 in november uranus promises unex-
 pected gain or some very pleasant sur-
 prise for you for your vibrations arc
 now in harmony with his powerful rays
 if therefore you are the child of emo-
 tional cancer or magnetic scorpion you
 may make a sudden change which will
 turn out very much to your advantage
 you may form a new friendship which
 will change the whole current of your
 life or this influence may materialize
 as sudden gain through investment or
 speculation

   and whatever comes will come to
 you suddenly this is a good time for
 you to travel-to join new societies or
 to associate yourself with some progres-
 sive movement because the uranian in-
 fluence seems to work better through
 numbers of people than through any one
 individual

 if your birth occurred at about this
 time you will probably develop or
 now possess great application and per-
 severance do not grumble if you feel
 that you are overloaded with work you
 will be able to handle it and it will be
 the means of leading you to success

   april and august are the luckiest
 months of the year for those born dur-
 ing the first three weeks of december

   there is one thing you must not for-
 get and it is this the stars donot make
 your destiny you control your own life
 -within certain limitations but the
 stars do tell you whether the road of life
 along which you have to travel is clear
 or not

   therefore if along lifes road-way you
 find yourself faced with obstacles of all
 kinds and are feeling depressed and dis-
 couraged-remember this is only a pass-
 ing phase

   remember also that when you learn
 to see a little way ahead and prepare
 yourself the way becomes easier and
 success is brought within your grasp
