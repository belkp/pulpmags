dontibu  make him the

 laughing stock of the place

 but when he started
 to play the piano   

 vshat a glorious night

      henris quaint restaurant was
  crowded with joyful parties to-
  night john brent was giving a
  party for eight in honor of helen
  thompsons engagement dick
  peters had recommended henris
  as a splendid place to dine and
  dance and dick was right

 whats that in your pocket
 dick your will asked john

   no thats just some sheet
 music i bought on the way over
 returned dick

   what in heavens name are
 you doing with sheet music  go-
 ing to use it as wall-paper ex-
 claimed john

    why im liaruiiii to play the
  pinno didnt you know

    oh boy  rislen to that you
 couldnt loarn to play in a thou-
 sand years

   dick looked at john with an
 amused smile on his face

   what would you give to hear
 me play he asked calmly

    a ten dollar bill it youll go up
  there rishr now and play that
  piano what do you say  ex-
  claimed john with triumph in his
  voice	

    youre oil replied dick quick
  as a flash ill take you up 
  that little dare but not here-
  wait til we get home tonight

    xo sir youll win or lose that
  bet right now come  fellows
  lets take him right up to the piano
  and well settle it here

    dont be foolish boys youll
  onlv make us the laughing stock of
  the place begged one of the girls

    heedless of dicks pleading they
  dragged him to the platform and
  placed him at the piano by this
  time the unusual goings  had
  caught the at trillion of everyone in
  the restaurant now dick realized
  that he had to go through with it
  so summing tip all his courage and
  with a sudden burst of confldence
  lie broke into the chorus of the lat-
  est broadway hit

   john gasped he couldnt be-
 lieve his ears everyone at the ta-
 ble sat in open-mouthed amazement
 as dick sat there playing

 snappy number after another it
 wasnt until the regular orchestra
 returned that they allowed dick to
 rise from the piano amid the din
 of applause lie went back to the
 table only to be swamped with
 questions but dick refused to tell
 them the secret of his new-found
 musical ability in spite of all
  their begging

   going home that night dick
 finally gave in

    well john ive put one over
  you i learned to play by my-
 self without a teacher

    what thats impossible tell
 me more

  dick tells his secret

   dick then explained how he had
 always longed to be able to play
 some musical instrument one day

picture plays sixteenth
year

the best magazine of the screen
celebrates a birthday

 proudly picture play looks back upon its years of
service to motion-picture enthusiasts because of its success in
offering them a true record of the screen

    keeping in step with all the changes in public taste
picture play has faithfully reflected popular preferences in
films and personalities reporting them fully impartially enter-
tainingly

     its readers call it the friendliest of all movie magazines
because intimacy is its keynote

    this is because picture play is fair it has no axes
to grind no politics to play no favorites to force upon its readers
and no taboos except anything that savors of bad taste

    this is the spirit that will continue to guide picture
play in the years to come-the principle on which it will keep
old friends and gain new ones-the inspiration that will bring
added authority and power

keep good company-read picture play

through the storm

b-ehind time and in a furious
hurry the royal limited
crack train of the line was
flashing through a black night
of heavy wind-driven rain up from
the river valleys to the south it had
fought its way over the long grades
in the teeth of a howling gale and now
the thundering roar of its swift advance
was reverberating through pine-clad

 ds-c

mountains those lonely heights were
completely hidden in the dense darkness
except now and then at bends of the
road when to the men in the cab oi
the locomotive the long searching glare
of the headlight illumined steep storm-
swept slopes

  the night was half gone in the
sleepers the berths had been made up
long ago and most of them were oc-
cupied in the club smoker which had
been well filled earlier in the night only
three passengers remained presumably
detective story magazine

they were either fond of late hours or
were not going through to montreal
where the train was due early in the
morning one of the three sprawled
out in his leather-padded armchair his
pipe growing cold in his hand had
dropped into snoring slumber the
two others still wide awake were seated
facing each other across the width of
the cozy brightly lighted car they
could hear the rain pounding on the
iron roof and swishing madly against
the windows one of them long-limbed
broad-shouldered sun-browned with a
big sapphire in his tie was placidly
smoking a cigar the other smartly
dressed dark slender extremely hand-
some was being served with mineral
water by the negro porter as he raised
a slim white hand and grasped the long
glass tinkling with ice his cuff slipped
back and revealed a gold watch fastened
to his wrist with a broad decorative
blue strap

  at that moment a wizened gray-
haired passenger with the brim of a soft
hat pulled down over his eyes came
slowly and with uncertain steps from
the narrow entrance passage beside the
buffet kitchen the man with the wrist
watch cast the approaching figure an
indifferent glance which suddenly de-
veloped into a wide-eyed curious stare
the glass slipped from his fingers and
crashed on the floor the accident
seemed to jar the nerves of the old fel-
low who had just entered his feeble-
looking eyes blinked nervously from
behind steel-rimmed spectacles appar-
ently his sight was too poor to see just
what had happened and the crash close
to his feet had confused him as he
drew back from the scattered pieces
of glass the speeding train gave a lurch
that threw him off his balance he fell
forward his head struck heavily against
the arm of a chair and he crumpled
unconscious on the floor

  the man with the sapphire pin sprang
to his assistance the snores of the

sleeper in the chair a few feet away
ceased abruptly and opening his eyes
he looked at the prostrate figure with
languid interest the man with the
wrist watch rose slowly to his feet with
a bewildered frown

  on his knees on the floor the man
with the sapphire proceeded to examine
the silent motionless form beside him
nothing very serious he announced
at last his hearts pumping all right
hell come out of his trance pretty soon
a mean little bump on his head thats
all porter bring some ice

  as he waited for the porter to re-
turn he noticed that one of the un-
conscious mans hands was scratched
and bleeding little slivers of broken
glass were sticking into the palm care-
fully he picked them out and looking
for more rolled back the sleeve of his
patients undershirt a sleeve so unusu-
ally long that it had come way down
to the joint of the wounded hand a
startled expression came into his eyes
and he gave a prolonged stare of amaze-
ment at the wrist he had exposed com-
pletely encircling that wrist was an old
livid scar for a long moment it
seemed to hold him spellbound then
slowly he covered it with the sleeve
as the porter came back with the ice

  presently while the ice was being
rubbed over his forehead the patient
opened his eyes and looked up bewil-
dered into the sun-browned face bend-
ing over him after a moment he
made an effort to rise im all right
he whispered breathing hard dizzy
thats all

  if you can walk youd better go to
your berth advised the man with the
sapphire helping him to his feet ill
help you to get back there if you say
so

  the other sank into a chair no
i get out at the next stop he explained
speaking with difficulty i-i came
here thinking id just have time for
a smoke dont have to go back my
brand of the fetters



bags on the platform after pulling
out his handkerchief and wrapping it
around the scratches on his hand he
again closed his eyes couple of min-
utes rest and ill be all right he mur-
mured

  the porter proceeded to pick up
pieces of glass from the floor the
snoring passenger fell asleep again the
man with the sapphire and the man with
the wrist watch strolled away toward the
other end of the car and seated them-
selves together

  did you see that mark on his wrist
the man with the sapphire inquired
softly

  yes was the low-voiced reply
strange wasnt it

  you noticed i suppose that it ran
completely around his wrist what did
you make of it

  nothing did you

  i wondered said the man with the
sapphire slowly if it could be the mark
of a handcuff

  from the corners of his eyes his
companion shot a furtive glance at him
would a handcuff bite so deep as to
leave a scar like that

  its possible when i was a mine
boss in arizona i heard of such a case
two prisoners handcuffed together were
on their way to serve their terms one
of them middle-aged but with no previ-
ous criminal record had been given
twenty years for killing his former busi-
ness partner whom he accused of
robbing and ruining him the other
prisoner though only about half as old
as his companion was as smooth a
swindler as ever drifted into the west
they were about to get into the car that
was to take them to prison when the
younger one snatched with his free hand
the revolver of the officer in charge of
them and knocked him senseless

  the unarmed driver was forced out
and the prisoners escaped with the car
but the alarm had been spread so
quickly that there had been no time to

search the officer for the key to the
handcuffs far out on a hot waterless
desert the car broke down abandon-
ing the car and afraid of meeting some
searching party on the road they set
out across trackless country they car-
ried not a drop of water and perhaps
you can imagine what happened

 the man with the wrist watch
scowled i think i can he muttered
with a shrug

  three days later they came to a
shack where an old prospector was liv-
ing alone the man with the sapphire
continued they-were raving in de-
lirium and crying out for water for
hours they had been struggling in
frenzy to free themselves from the gal-
ling fetters which had grown as hot
as the burning sands in their insane
efforts to drag off the tight bracelets
the steel had worn through the skin and
then deep into the flesh as the tortured
inflamed wrists swelled but in spite
of the agony of it they were continuing
like maniacs to break loose

  the prospector after giving them
water and bringing them back to their
senses managed to file off the handcuffs
not to have done so would have been
inhuman cruelty he did not discover
until too late to get possession of it
that the younger one had a revolver in
his pocket they forced him to pro-
vide them with a burro a food supply
and canteens and to let them go free
but he knew they were marked men-
marked for life where the rings of steel
had bitten through the swollen bleed-
ing flesh to the bone

  and what became of them in-
quired the man with the wrist wratch

  i dont know they were never
caught i was told that the older one
had a wife and a small child a girl who
not long afterward disappeared from
their home i suppose they joined him
somewhere

  the man with the wrist watch glanc-
ing down the car observed that the vie-


detective story magazine

tim of the accident had twisted around
in his chair and was peering through a
rain-swept window it seemed as if he
must be watching for lights surely he
could have hoped to see nothing else in
that black night

  we must be getting pretty close to
the old fellows town the man with
the sapphire remarked

  the whistle of the royal limited sent
a long-drawn screech into the storm
they heard the hiss of the air brakes

  ive got to get my bag the man
with the wrist watch announced rising
from his chair i get off at the next
stop

  his companion looked up at him with
a puzzled frown i thought i heard
you telling the conductor you were
ticketed for montreal

  ive changed my mind

  hurriedly he made his way out of
the car presently arriving at his berth
he took possession of a big gladstone
bag a cane a soft hat and a light sum-
mer raincoat he put on the coat and
hat took a firm grip on the stick which
seemed like a futile appendage on such a
night and ordered the porter to carry
the bag to the door when a few mo-
ments later the train stopped at the sta-
tion he got out took the bag from the
porter tipped him generously and
catching sight of the gray-haired victim
of the accident proceeded to follow
him through the waiting room and out
onto a platform in the rear here a
stage was waiting the driver stand-
ing beside it cast a friendly grin of
recognition at the gray-haired arrival
right here waiting for you mr sher-
wood he said taking his bag and help-
ing him into the car

  where do you go the man with
the wrist watch sternly demanded of the
driver

  to northboro

  how far is that

  ten miles

  thats where im going

  plenty of room inside the driver
informed him

  a sudden gust of wind drove a de-
luge of rain into the covered platform
the man with the wrist watch glad to
find a refuge from it stepped hurriedly
into the car where he found a seat
among several passengers the gray-
haired man from the club smoker seated
facing him showed no sign of recog-
nition his weak-looking eyes were
blinking behind his spectacles his
handkerchief was still wound over his
wounded hand where the long sleeve of
his undershirt peeped out under the cuff
of his overcoat the strange scar was
completely hidden it was his right
hand that had been cut by the broken
glass therefore it was on his right wrist
that the scar had been revealed this
was a detail which had not escaped the
notice of the cold steady eyes that were
now studying him

  for a few moments the stage passed
through dimly lighted streets then the
black night closed in around it as it left
the town the man with the wrist
watch became absorbed in his thoughts
he pondered the scrap of information
that chance had given him about the
gray-haired man since leaving the train
so his name was sherwood he mused
and he was not a stranger here the
rain beat furiously against the windows
they were traveling rough mountain
roads where sometimes the grades
seemed perilously steep almost half
an hour passed before he came out of
his abstraction then he discovered
that they were again in dimly lighted
streets he raised his left wrist looked
at his watch and frowned it was very
late

  apparently they had arrived in
northboro at short intervals the car
stopped to let passengers off at their
homes the victim of the accident in
the club smoker apparently almost him-
self again got out in front of a cozy
isolated little house raised a big um-
brand of the fetters



brella and lugging his bag fought his
way through wind and rain up the gar-
den path before long the man with
the wrist watch was the only remaining
passenger

  where do you go brother the
driver inquired

  to the best hotel i can find was
the sharp reply

  thatll be the pine tree tavern a
pretty classy place

  then take me there by the way
there was a man named sherwood who
came up on the train with me do you
know him

  know him well hes the proprietor
of the biggest store in this village he
goes down to boston two or three times
a year to buy stock thats where hes
come from now i guess

  a storekeeper eh is he making a
good living at it

  you can bet your life he is why
stranger i happen to know hes got
twenty thousand dollars out on mort-
gages right here in northboro and they
say hes the biggest depositor the
northboro banks got

  a smile lit the handsome face of the
lone passenger it lingered -faintly on
his lips until he arrived at his destina-
tion

  as the stranger stepped into the lobby
of the pine tree tavern the sleepy
round red face of rufus bagley the
proprietor who had been sitting up for
the stage appeared behind the office
desk

  can i get a room and bath here
the stranger inquired stepping up to the
open register and selecting a pen from
the rack

  several of em bagley informed
him and quoted the prices

  the best youve got said the stran-
ger and he wrote on the register
archibald ely nash new york
bagley carrying the bag led him up-
stairs to the next floor and to a room
which the new arrival looked over with

sharply appraising eyes this will do
he decided presently and then pleas-
antly aware of the fact that he had not
been asked for a payment he added
im likely to be here for some time

  as soon as he was alone archibald
ely nash proceeded to prepare himself
for bed after a few moments he
paused in his shirt sleeves in front of
the bureau and studied himself in the
mirror it always pleased him to note
how well he had kept his youth so
far as his appearance was concerned
the years had been good to him he
could have passed as no more than
thirty though he was several years older
than that

  slowly lie unfastened the broad strap
of his watch from his left wrist for
a moment he paused and listened to the
storm beating at the windows then
as if with sudden bitter recollections he
stared with brooding eyes at the place
which the strap had covered com-
pletely encircling that exposed wrist was
a scar-such a scar as he had seen on
the right wrist of the unconscious man
in the club smoker of the royal limited

chapter ii

beneath the mask

the handsome stranger who had
registered at the pine tree tavern
the night before as archibald ely nash
of new york stepped out from the
lobby into the cool brisk air of a sep-
tember day the storm had passed and
the sun was shining pausing he cast a
keenly observant glance at a group of
young women seated on the broad
veranda for an instant an almost im-
perceptible smile flickered on his lips
as if he were fully conscious of the fact
that every one of them was regarding
him with critical and absorbing interest
the season was drawing to an end at
northboro and most of the young men
at the summer colony had gone

at such a time when the tavern was


detective story magazine

inhabited mostly by mothers and their
daughters and a few old fellows no
longer hampered by business ties the
arrival of archibald ely nash who to
feminine eyes was as alluring as a movie
hero had naturally produced a mild sen-
sation there was a general impres-
sion that he must be a person of social
position and of means not only his
appcarance and his manner but even his
name was impressive it is surprising
what a difference it makes when a man
uses all three of his names if he hap-
pens to have that number instead of
being content with just two and a mid-
dle initial

  archibald ely nash had discovered
that shakespeare was wrong when he
scoffingly asked whats in a name
and that there could be magic in names
sometimes and at present he needed
all the magic he could conjure to offset
the grim fact known only to himself
that the five-dollar bill nesting in a
pocket of his vest was all the money he
had in the world

  for a time he had felt that fortune
might have something in store for him
in new york but his adventures there
had been unfortunate particularly with
the police and he had decided that can-
ada offered him more safety then on
the royal limited he had caught sight
of a face that had startled him he
had stared at it doubtfully if it was
the face of a man who had suddenly
risen out of his memory it had changed
so much as to make recognition uncer-
tain and then he saw the strange scar
on the mans wrist after that he no
longer doubted

  as he stood lingering on the veranda
of the pine tree tavern he betrayed
not the least indication of his straitened
circumstances his natty blue suit
immaculate white spats over brand-new
shoes pearl-gray hat of expensive vel-
vour with its brim turned down rakishly
over his left eye fine linen modish tie
and a yellow malacca cane with an am-

ber crook were certainly not the acces-
sories of destitution the young women
in the porch chairs stared at him fas-
cinated this gorgeous stranger with
his slender beautifully proportioned fig-
ure finely modeled features clear white
skin and carefully groomed dark hair
was the most pleasing sight that had ap-
peared before their eyes all that sum-
mer

  but as befitted a man with only five
dollars to his name and a growing hotel
bill he turned his back upon them pres-
ently and passed on down the veranda
steps and along the path that led to the
tree-lined main street of the village his
handsome face showed not a care des-
perate circumstances he had faced be-
fore many a time behind him was an
adventurous career that had been long
enough to teach him many ways of
wriggling out of trouble it would have
taken something a good deal more seri-
ous than mere shortage of money to dis-
turb the magnificent pose of archibald
ely nash

  a short walk brought him into the
business district of the village here
were a few small stores a post office
and a bank northboro tucked in a
fold of the hills was a thrving little
place farmers came in from all over
the township to buy their supplies and
in summer the high dry air and the
beauty of near-by mountains filled the
tavern with prosperous visitors across
the street from the bank the big show
windows of a two-story frame building
exhibited a wide variety of goods over
the doorway was a conspicuous sign
sherwoods general store archi-
bald ely nash stopped in front of the
sign and looked in through the win-
dows it was a slack hour and the place
seemed to be deserted jauntily swing-
ing his cane he stepped inside

  for a moment he believed he was
alone and looking about he studied the
place with keen interest here crowded
into one big room it seemed as if there
brand of the fetters



must be everything a customer could
possibly want everything from millinery
to farm tools presently a soft voice
broke the silence is there something
i can show you a girl had come into
view from behind stacks of dry goods
and was addressing him from one of
the counters she was attractive enough
to draw his most engaging smile as he
stepped over to her on closer obser-
vation he thought he detected in her
comely face a faint resemblance to the
man he had come to see

  something tells me you are seth
sherwoods daughter he remarked

  his familiar advances met with no
encouragement then something tells
you the truth she returned brusquely

  but he had stirred her curiosity and
she was studying him with sharp in-
terest he was of a type that had never
attracted her for her years she was
a keen judge of character and she de-
cided there was something about this
stranger that she did not like it seemed
to her that that handsome - beguiling
face was like a mask for something evil
and menacing for a moment his cold
gray eyes held her spellbound never
before had she seen a man with eyes so
utterly lacking in human feeling they
were as soulless as the eyes of a cat

  with sudden resentment of her un-
friendly attitude his manner stiffened
i came here to see your father he an-
nounced grimly

  the girl pointed to an open door
in the rear youll find him back there
in the office

  the caller made his way into the lit-
tle rear room and finding seth sher-
wood alone there at his desk closed the
door the storekeeper who to judge
from the closeness with which he had
been holding his spectacled eyes to the
open pages of a ledger was very near-
sighted swung around in his swivel
chair and stared up at the intruder re-
proachfully who told you to close
that door he demanded

  he seemed to be very little the worse
because of the accident of the night be-
fore there was a slight bruise on his
forehead and strips of court-plaster
covered the few slight cuts on his right
hand

  so you dont remember me said
the caller with a smile the last time
we saw each other until last night we
were a good two thousand miles from
here that was twelve years ago

  the storekeepers eyes widened
youve made a mistake he gasped i
never saw you before i was never
two thousand miles from here in my
life

  you cant fool me sherwin the
dapper visitor persisted youve
changed your name a trifle and youve
grown pretty old but youre the same
bird all right the visitor drew nearer
and his voice sank to a whisper we
separated on the edge of a desert we
were hunted men you and i for you
twenty years in prison was waiting
ive made no mistake about you last
night in the club car of the train i saw
plainly the mark of the nippers on your
wrist

  for several tense seconds the store-
keeper did not speak suddenly he rose
from his chair stepped close to his
visitor and peered into his face with
a long searching look dupree he
muttered under his breath joe du-
pree 

  right but while i am in north-
boro my name is nash

  there was a prolonged silence while
seth sherwood stood staring at his
visitor dubiously the years rolled back
with the eyes of his imagination the
gray-haired man saw again the glaring
desert sands and the blistering sun flar-
ing red in a brazen sky once more
he felt fettering steel burning into his
swollen flesh he shuddered as he tried
to draw his thoughts away from a
chapter of his life he had been trying
for twelve years to forget i never


detective story magazine

expected to see you again joe he said
at last

  the visitors gaze wandered around
the little office i hear the worlds been
pretty good to you since we left each
other twelve years ago he said sul-
lenly

  i dont know that it has the store-
keeper returned with a touch of bitter-
ness my wife died the year after we
came here i dont get much out of
life except worry for all those twelve
years ive been living in fear dupree-
fear

  i never let fear bother me said the
visitor with a shrug if i were as well
fixed as you are sherwin id never
worry about anything at all but luck
dont seem to like me through all
those years ive been stepping out of
one trouble into another in fact im
in trouble right now

  what kind of trouble this time
joe

  oh nothing very serious broke
thats all i thought that perhaps you
could oblige me with a loan

  the storekeeper screwed up his wiz-
ened face as if in sudden pain im
pretty hard up myself joe he parried
after a moment of deep thought i
have to watch the pennies pretty close
to make both ends meet how much
do you want 

  a thousand dollars was the prompt
reply 

  a thousand dollars seth sherwood
cried why joe how could i ever
raise a thousand dollars a poor country
storekeeper like me

  your check would be good for that
much at any time across the street at the
bank archibald ely nash insisted i
hear this store of yours is a gold mine
and that you own mortgages all over
the village ive learned a good deal
about your affairs since i drifted into
northboro

  youve been hearing a lot of fool
gossip sherwood protested to let

you have a thousand dollars would start
me on the road to bankruptcy

  joe dupree alias archibald ely nash
gazed reflectively at the amber crook of
his cane oh well he sighed after
a moment i suppose ill have to raise
the ducats somewhere eke and mov-
ing slowly toward the door he added
i guess ill go out and have a chat
with your daughter maybe shell be
interested to hear me talk about the old
times in the west

  wait cried the storekeeper his
voice shrill with excitement youre
not going to mention that old trouble of
mine to lorna

  lorna queried nash is that
your daughters name you mean she
doesnt know

  she was too young to know she
was only eight years old at the time of
the trouble shes never found out
about it

  nash who had been a little doubtful
on that point pondered the information
silently he had heard at the tavern
that seth sherwood though an influen-
tial citizen of the village was generally
regarded as a misery skinflint with a
heart for nobody in the world but his
daughter presently he turned away
from the door and fastened on the store-
keeper a look that made the dried-up old
man tremble the evil that lurked be-
neath the handsome alluring mask was
revealing itself clearly now the cold
gray eyes of joe dupree were merciless
do i get the thousand seth sher-
wood he inquired softly or do you
want me to talk to your daughter about
the old days and then send the tip out
to a certain place in the west that a
runaway prisoner wanted there to serve
a twenty-year sentence for homicide is
one of the leading citizens of north-
boro

  the old man feeling himself becom-
ing enmeshed in that dreadful tortur-
ing thing the net of a blackmailer was
desperately trying to save himself he
brand of the fetters



was almost beaten but there was still
a little fight left in him youre a
wanted man yourself he cried if
they take me back there you go too

  i dont think so the other returned
calmly im foot-loose i could drop
out of sight pretty quick it wouldnt
be from northboro that id send the tip
out there  id wait until i was in a
safer place but you cant drop out
of sight seth sherwood-not unless
you give up your home and your daugh-
ter and your business

  the storekeeper pressed a quivering
hand to his perspiring forehead he
realized at last that he was trapped
helpless to save himself he would
have been willing to part with a good
deal more than a thousand dollars but
he knew what blackmail meant neither
a thousand dollars nor twice that much
was going to get him out of the net
this man would come again and again
always asking for more and eventually
would ruin him i-ill try to raise the
money for you joe he stammered at
last

  when do i get it the visitor de-
manded sharply

  i cant just say in a few days per-
haps its going to be hard work rais-
ing it

  i want it now go over to the bank
and draw it ill wait here

  but i havent got that much there
the storekeeper protested youve got
to give me time

  not an hour and the bank will be
closing pretty soon get a move on
yourself sherwood

  archibald ely nash had felt almost
certain that seth sherwoods bank ac-
count was more than enough to meet his
demand and that he was not mistaken
became evident when the storekeeper
realizing the futility of further protests
picked up a check book from his desk
and went out of the office a moment
atcr as he passed through the store
lorna sherwood was startled by the

haunted look in his eyes and his agitated
manner

   why father whats the matter she
exclaimed

   nothing-nothing at all lorna he
answered hoarsely everythings all
right

   but lorna knew that everything was
not all right and she was convinced that
the handsome stranger in the office had
brought bad news deeply puzzled she
looked out through one of the show
wudows and watched her father cross
the street and enter the bank soon he
was back hurrying past her without a
word and returning to his office where
immediately he closed the door it was
very seldom the office door was closed
and she felt sure that something of a
particularly secretive nature must be
going on there a few minutes passed
then the stranger came out alone he
was swinging his cane jauntily and he
was smiling it was strange she mused
that a bearer of bad news should look
so self-satisfied and cheerful

chapter iii

 poor man and heiress

j ate in the afternoon of the follow-
ing day archibald ely nash no
longer facing destitution but with a
thousand dollars added to the five-dollar
bill which had been the extent of his
financial resources twenty-four hours
earlier was sunning himself on the ve-
randa of the pine tree tavern when
a particularly smart runabout carrying
a young man and a girl drew up at the
end of the lawn

   the car could be easily recognized
as one of the most expensive makes in
the market and this evidence of wealth
stirred nashs interest at once the
young couple stepped out and made their
way up to the hotel the girl was a
tall slender stylish blonde her com-
panion a rugged athletic type square-
jawed rough-featured as they came


detective story magazine

up the steps the girl caught sight of
nash and observing that he wag watch-
ing her admiringly and that he was the
handsomest man she had seen all sum-
mer she gave him a smile which he
was quick to return

  as she and her companion entered
the hotel nash rose from his chair and
followed them ignoring the office
where on the counter the register lay
open for new arrivals the couple passed
on through the lobby and into the tea
room the entrancing smile the girl had
bestowed upon him had quickened
nashs interest from behind the office
desk appeared the round red face of
rufus bagley the taverns proprietor
and nash strolled over to him in quest
of information

  do you happen to know who the
girl is who passed through here just
now he inquired

  thats andrew j marlands daugh-
ter bagley informed him

 marland the name was un-
familiar to nash

  you never heard of andrew j mar-
land said bagley with a look of sur-
prise why hes the woolen king
owns a whole manufacturing town
down near boston he was born up
here in norothboro in the same house
where he spends his summers now you
must have noticed the place big white
house up on the hill half a mile east of
here a good many acres of private
estate with a brick-and-cement wall run-
ning round them hes fixed the old
house over considerably since he made
his pile and hes added a couple of
wings to it i understand the daughter
finds northboro too slow for her but
she cant get the old man to go any-
where else

  and the man whos with her  nash
persisted not her husband is he

  bagley grinned not so lucky hes
only the man who wants to be her hus-
band theyre supposed to be engaged
but that dont mean much to jane mar-

land shes been engaged two or three
times before lefty burke wont be
sure of her till theyre married which
isnt liable to happen the old man being
dead set against it hes so sore he
wont even let lefty come to the house
thats why they drift in here for tea
every day or two

  turning his eyes to the doorway of
the tea room through which he caught
a glimpse of the young couple who had
seated themselves at one of the tables
tash- began to ruminate deeply over
what he had just learned

  nice car out there he remarked
after a moment that burkes

  leftys gosh no thats jane
marlands lefty couldnt afford a car
like that he had to scratch around
pretty lively to raise the cash for a
secondhand flivver i aint saying he
isnt all right but hes not in the mar-
land class old marlands ambitious for
his daughter wants her to marry some-
body high up in the world lefty came
from poor folks and hes had a hard
row to hoe nice enough young fellow
lots of push to him went to college
pitched for the college team thats
where he got his name a left-handed
twirler between you and me i dont
believe jane marland cares much about
him but attractive young men happened
to be scarce around here this summer
and lefty made the best of his opportu-
nities

  and what does this bird do for a
living said nash

  oh hes got a little office up the
road sells village lots farms and in-
surance-or tries to hes got a cheap
room here at the tavern

  stroking his chin with his soft mani-
cured fingers nash gave an ironic smile
it would be quite a rise in the world
for this lefty burke if he married jane
marland eh especially when the old
man died how many millions will she
get

  quite a number returned bagley
brand of the fetters



vaguely shes the only child and her
mothers dead

  suddenly in nashs agile mind am-
bition began to stir as never before
jane marland heiress to millions had
smiled at him at least to that extent
he had attracted her he was fully
aware of his own charms he knew the
flutter of excitement he had stirred
among the girls at the tavern they
were calling him adonis as he had
learned from overhearing scraps of con-
versation not intended for his ears and
a library dictionary had informed him
that adonis was a youth so beautiful
and alluring that the goddesses fought
over him

  it would be an easy game he mused
to himself a game that would be safe
win or lose and something tells me i
wouldnt lose

  but a disturbing thought brought a
little pucker into his forehead there
would be andrew j marland to be
reckoned with if the old man objected
so strenuously to lefty burke what
would he do if he discovered the un-
known mysterious archibald ely nash
suing for his daughters hand here
was a serious difficulty indeed yet there
might be some way of overcoming it
with this perplexing problem in his
resourceful mind he began to stroll
slowly up and down the lobby his head
bowed in thought he was still there
when half an hour later jane marland
and lefty burke came out of the tea
room the girl noticed nash at once
and again she smiled at him even more
graciously than before the interchange
of flirtatious glances between the two
was so obvious that it failed to escape
burkes attention his eyes flashed
wrath fully

  see here jane he growled loudly
enough for nash to overhear i noticed
what passed between you and that cheap
romeo out on the veranda and now
youre at it again havent you any
sense at all you dont know anything

about the fellow he may be a bad
one

  jealous lefty she teased

  burke was too angry to trust his voice
he turned a truculent glare to the hand-
some stranger and with the girl beside
him passed on the incident left nash
unruffled with a self-satisfied smile
he turned to a window and watched the
pair get into the runabout and drive
away

  what a chance he mused mil-
lions of dollars waiting for the guy that
gets that girl and nobody in the way
except that poor stiff lefty burke

  but for the moment he had forgotten
andrew j marland

  ill play the game he decided ive
got a strong hunch that some day jane
marland is going to become mrs archi-
bald ely nash

chapter iv

rivals

deing in no need of money at pres-
ent nash remained away from the
victim who had so reluctantly parted
with a thousand dollars but now and
then he cast a reflective eye on the gen-
eral store across the way from the bank
he felt a sense of ownership in the
place its usually brisk business pleased
him he was confident that he could
go in there and collect the profits when-
ever he might choose once he spoke
to lorna sherwood on the street and
she cut him dead the incident made
him wonder whether she had discovered
what he had done to her father it
seemed improbable that she knew but
she had made her dislike for nash very
plain 

  that however did not worry him
in the least lorna sherwood occupied
only a small place in his thoughts there
was only one girl in northboro he was
thinking much about at present that
was jane marland he strolled out to
the hill east of the village and took a

look at the marland house and its well-
kept acres the idea that he himself
might some time own or at least share
in that fine estate gave him a thrill but
again and again andrew j marland
had come into his mind as a formidable
obstacle to his ambition marland had
been pointed out to him on the street
and nash had observed with a good deal
of satisfaction that the woolen king a
grim sharp-eyed man was getting old
and feeble what a stroke of fortune
his death if it did not come too late
would be to the crooked adventurer who
was after his daughter

  on the fickle susceptible jane mar-
land the adonis of the tavern had made
on their first sight of each other even
more of an impression than he sus-
pected she was fond of lefty and had
been taking her engagement to him
rather seriously in fact her fathers
stern opposition to the match had helped
burkes cause instead of hurting it for
jane was a girl who chafed under re-
straint and she might marry lefty just
to show that she was her own boss if for
no other reason but the idea of carry-
ing on a flirtation with the handsome
stranger at the tavern was appealing
and stirred all her romantic impulses
she decided to give him an opportunity
of making her acquaintance and two
days after the incident that had aroused
leftys jealousy she went to the tavern
alone choosing a time when usually
lefty was away at business

  it was there in the spacious lounge
room that nash discovered her she
was seated at the big center table look-
ing over the magazines as he came
strolling slowly toward her she looked
up at him and smiled charmingly

  i feel as if we were already old
friends said nash with cool self-assur-
ance you remember perhaps that we
have seen each other before though not
under such agreeable circumstances

  but i dont even know your name
she protested

  he proceeded to introduce himself
i have been hoping for this opportu-
nity he told her softly but  was
afraid i was never going to find it now
that it has come it seems too good to
be true

  jane marland laughed at him it
seems to me you are a little sudden she
said do you say such nice things to
every girl you meet for the first time
you may not believe it but girls have
seldom interested me he answered sol-
emnly until i saw you here the other
day i was heart free and glad of it
but the whole world has changed for me
since then

  really she said with a twinkle of
amusement in her eyes how nice of
you to say so i dont suppose you
mean a word of it but its a relief to find
in this dull town a man who knows how
to talk 

  it is dull isnt it he admitted i
dont know why i came here i was
going to get out after the first day
and then i saw you

  oh so youve been staying on just
on my account

  for  other reason

  jane marland leaned back in her chair
and laughed softly the adonis of the
tavern was surpassing all her expecta-
tions of him  but though she seemed
to be merely amused by him she would
have been glad to discover that she could
take his words seriously she could not
recall that she had ever met quite such
a charming man if she should find he
was really in earnest in his apparent de-
votion she was beginning to feel already
that lefty burke would have a formid-
able rival for her affections

  its tea time isnt it he remarked
a few minutes later suppose we go
and see what the tavern has to offer
they went into the tea room and
seated themselves at one of the little
tables they had been there only a short
time when lefty burke appeared in the
lobby and looked in at them lefty
brand of the fetters



was a picture of suppressed fury he
could hardly restrain himself he had
seen enough to know that the handsome
stranger was making a strong impres-
sion upon jane marland but he did
not go into the tea room and pres-
ently finding the hotel unendurable
under the circumstances he went out
and made his way to his office there
alone with bitter thoughts he remained
for an hour

  i guess its about time i had an inter-
view with that bird he decided at last
and seething with anger he returned
to the tavern jane marland had gone
and out on the veranda nash was sit-
ting alone lefty stepped up to him
with menace in his eyes

  nash i want you to keep away from
miss marland he announced abruptly
youre a stranger here she knows
nothing about you youve never even
been introduced to her as far as i can
learn you had an unholy nerve to even
speak to her if she wasnt just a
spoiled child she wouldnt have had
anything to do with you

  nash rose to his feet i dont think
i need any advice from you he said
scornfully it seems to me youre act-
ing like a fool miss marland is old
enough to take care of herself without
your interference

  are you going to keep away from
her or not lefty persisted

  emphatically not if she wants to
see me

  i happen to be engaged to marry
miss marland lefty explained

  then im sorry for her said nash
with a shrug

  suddenly losing control of himself
lefty swung a fist at him savagely
staggering back from a heavy blow on
the jaw archibald ely nash saw stars
he barely saved himself from falling
regaining his balance he stood staring
at lefty with venomous hatred its
lucky for you im not packing a gun
he hissed between his teeth

  so youre a gun fighter eh lefty
growled at him i knew you were some
kind of a crook it shows all over you
i guess ill have to watch out for my-
self or ill feel a knife in my back some
dark night

  turning away he left nash to nurse
his hate and nash was a man whose
hate was dangerous there was an
evil inhuman glare in his eyes now
that would have been terrible to see

chapter v

     struck down in the dark

w hen at last nash regained his

      composure he began to realize that
he was in a very awkward situation
jane marland had promised to call on
the afternoon of the next day to take
him out in her car and show him some
of the mountain scenery if burke
should see them together again there
would almost certainly be more trouble
perhaps another blow on the jaw nash
knew that in a fist fight he would not
have the slightest chance against lefty
and he dreaded another encounter with
him how was he going to continue his
attentions to jane and at the same time
avoid burkes vengeance it was a
problem for which he could find no im-
mediate solution however he was
quite certain he was not going to sur-
render to burkes demand he fully in-
tended to see the heiress to marlands
millions whenever the opportunity might
offer itself

  but fate was bringing an answer to
his problem more quickly than he could
have imagined fate was on the tele-
graph wire the next morning sending
a message to marland the woolen
king learned that business made his
presence at a certain directors meet-
ing in san francisco of pressing neces-
sity to get there in time he would
have to leave northboro early the fol-
lowing morning to provide himself
with money for the trip marland went


detective story magazine

  to the bank soon after receiving the mes-
   sage he drew out fifteen hundred dol-
  lars in fifty-dollar bills fresh from the
  treasury he was slipping the money
  into a pocketbook as he came out of the
  bank

   at that moment nash happened to
 pass by he noticed marland on the
 banks step with the money in his
 hands he was able to see that it was
 quite a sizable wad of large denomina-
 tions more than once in his varied
 career such a display of money had
 tempted nash to theft but there was no
 such temptation now when without any
 risk he could provide for all his needs
 merely by calling on seth sherwood
 but marland was always of interest to
 him and he watched the old man cross
 the street and enter sherwoods store
 then nash continued on his way to the
 tavern

    when marland came into the store he
  found lorna sherwood ready to wait
  upon him you carry most everything
  here dont you he said i want a
  small traveling bag thats easy to carry
  the only small ones ive got are in my
  house in boston and ive got to start
  for the west coast first thing in the
  morning

    presently lorna found a bag that
 satisfied him and as he never cared to
 run accounts in the local stores he of-
 fered one of his new fifty-dollar bills in
 payment sorry but its the smallest
 ive got he explained a nice fresh
 one just drew it out of the bank
 knew they wouldnt be open over there
 at the hour ive got to leave in the morn-
 ing

    lorna slipped the bill into the cash
  register and counted out the change
  and marland carrying his new bag re-
  turned to his home on the hill

    in the middle of the afternoon his
  daughter drove in her smart runabout
  to the tavern where she found nash
  waiting for her his handsome face
  was unmarked by the blow lefty had

given him the day before and it was not
until they were out of the village and on
a road where the mountains stretched
out before them in a magnificent pano-
rama that he made any mention of her
indignant fiances call upon him

  your friend burke seems to think
i have no right to your acquaintance
he informed her he came to see me
yesterday and spoke his mind rather
freely

  what she exclaimed he came
to see you about me why he must
be crazy

  he was one of the craziest men
 ever saw he told me he was engaged
to marry you and that i being a stran-
ger not entirely above suspicion must
have nothing more to do with you
what business is it of his she
cried angrily i thought he had more
sense ill have to have a talk with
lefty about this hes got to under-
stand that im my own boss

  so youre really engaged to marrv
that man nash sighed dismally

  oh i suppose so she returned in
spite of his faults im fond of lefty
for nash the scenery had no interest
he almost ignored it so busy were his
thoughts with the problem of how to get
rid of lefty burke and then there
was that other problem presented by
marland not only burke but the old
man too stood in his way of winning
this girl to steal her from burke he
felt might not be so difficult but what
would be the use of winning a girl whose
father might disinherit her or tie up her
money so that her husband would never
be able to lay hands on a dollar of it 

  dad starts for california to-morrow
morning she informed him when at
last they had exhausted the subject of
burkes interference

  i hope that doesnt mean you are
going back to boston he said anx-
iously

  no ill stay here its going to be
a hurried trip and hell be back in a
brand of the fetters



very short while we always keep the
northboro house open till the snow be-
gins to fly

  nash who for a moment had felt
that his chance of winning the marland
millions was slipping away from him
heaved a sigh of relief

  when hes gone ill invite you to
the house she said if lefty objects
well just tell him to go and jump on
himself

  hes more likely to jump on me
nash remarked with a frown

  well you have as much right there
as he has she returned with a toss of
her head hes been forbidden to
come and as dad sits up until all hours
of the night poor lefty has to stay
away

  so your father is a night owl mut-
tered nash thoughtfully

  always has been he never goes to
bed until midnight no matter how early
he gets up

  nash tucked this scrap of information
away in his mind as something that
might be worth remembering and pres-
ently his thoughts returned to his per-
plexing problems during the remain-
der of the ride he was unusually silent
a vague idea had taken possession of
him and was slowly growing clearer and
developing it was an idea so sinister
and desperate that it frightened him at
first but he refused to let it alone by
the time they returned to the tavern
he had considered it so carefully in every
detail and had found it so flawless that
his fear of it was gone and he was
convinced that he had found a way out
of his difficulties

  half an hour after parting from jane
marland he stepped into the public
phone booth in the drug store and called
the office of lefty burke the drug-
store booth was used so frequently and
by so many strangers on their way
through the village that he knew the
call would never be traced to himself
it was burke who answered him the

young real-estate dealer when in his of-
fice was usually alone for he had neither
stenographer nor clerk and few visitors

  my name is johnson said nash
disguising his voice i want to buy a
farm and i understand youve got some
for sale but i cant get over to see
you until nine oclock to-night can
you meet me at that time at your office 
it may be too late to see the properties
but i can look over your lists and maps
and maybe i can get a pretty good idea
from you of what youve got to offer

  lefty who had scarcely ever kept his
little office open so late as nine oclock
was under the impression that the stran-
ger johnson was calling from some
distant town ill be there he agreed
elated at the prospect of making a sale

  at a few minutes before nine lefty
strolled down the road to the isolated
little shanty where he conducted his
business it was late for northboro
and the streets were deserted the of-
fice was dark and silent he pulled out
his key and opened the door he was
groping for the light switch when there
was a sudden stir in the darkness and a
blow from something blunt and heavy
knocked him senseless

  when at last he returned to conscious-
ness he discovered that his hands and
feet were securely bound and there was
a gag in his mouth he could not even
move his arms which were fastened
tightly to his sides with ropes wound
around his body his limbs were numb
almost without feeling so tight were his
bonds the office was pitch dark and
there was not a sound he was too
weak and dazed even to attempt to free
himself

  after what seemed like a long time
he heard the door open and somebody
came in he caught glimpses of the
indistinct figure of a man who presently
bent over him the mans face seemed
to be masked but it was so dark that
to lefty he was no more than a shadow
suddenly he caught the nauseating odor


detective story magazine

of chloroform a cloth saturated with
the drug was being pressed to his nose
and in a few moments he slipped again
into unconsciousness

  then once more his senses returned
the night had not passed for there was
not even a glimmer of light but he had
no idea of the hour to his surprise
he discovered that he was free the
gag and the ropes had been removed
dizzily he staggered up to his feet
after a moment he found the electric
button and flooded the place with light
he was alone and the ropes and the
gag had disappeared completely not
the slightest evidence remained of what
had happened to him the windows
were closed and locked there was no
sign of burglary the lock of the door
however was a simple one and he knew
that anybody with experience at that
sort of thing could have picked it easily

  if it were not for a splitting head-
ache and the lingering odor of chloro-
form he would almost have belifeved the
whole affair had been only a dream it
was hard to convince himself even now
that it had really happened it was so
inexplicable so preposterous when
presently he discovered that neither his
watch nor his money had been taken
and that the papers on his desk had not
been disturbed his perplexity grew it
seemed as if the attack upon him must
have been the act of a maniac

  i guess id better keep my mouth shut
about this he decided or the whole
village will be laughing at me theyll
say i dreamed it i havent got a darned
thing to prove it except a bump on my
head which may be gone by morning

  he looked at his watch it was al-
most one oclock he turned out the
light and finding his key in the pocket
where he had placed it after letting him-
self in locked the place up with his
thoughts in wild confusion he made his
way back to the pine tree tavern
entering the lobby he saw rufus bag-
ley drowsing in the office as he waited

for the arrival of the stage fiom the
railroad

  youre keeping pretty bad hours
rufus observed sleepily as he opened
one eye at lefty

  it looks that way dont it lefty
returned and passed on to the stairs and
up to his room he was so dizzy that he
could scarcely pull off his clothes but
at last after much effort he got into his
pajamas and crept into bed

chapter vi

a left-handed murder

though the night was more than
half gone when lefty burke fell
asleep in his room in the tavern after
the inexplicable attack upon him in his
office a light was still shining in the
home of andrew j marland it was
the little lamp on the desk in the li-
brary at that desk marland had been
sitting all through the evening and now
in the early hours of the morning he
was still there and there he remained
while the night dragged on into gray
dawn the sun rose but he did not stir
and the lamp was still burning

  at last a housemaid intent on setting
the house in order for the day stepped
into the room and startled at she caught
sight of the motionless figure at the
desk stopped abruptly just inside the
door mr marland  she called are
you awake

  there was no answer the woolen
king had fallen into a sleep from which
no human voice was ever going to rouse
him timidly the maid drew nearer
hours ago marland had been writing
business letters but now his pen had
rolled to the floor and the hand that
had been guiding it lay white and still
on a sheet of paper which was slightly
spattered with ink the desk stood
close against both walls of a corner of
the room near it was a wide-open win-
dow which looked out upon neatly kept
lawns and gardens in the rear of the

            ds-c
brand of the fetters



house the weather was warm for so
late in the season in the mountains
and the maid knew that marland had
opened the window himself early in the
evening the back of his chair almost
touched a curtain of a wide doorway
which gave a view of an adjoining room
where there was another open window
the maid had discovered that marland
was dead but that he had been mur-
dered did not occur to her until pres-
ently she caught sight of the long hilt
of a knife sticking out of his back that
discovery was too much for her nerves
and she screamed and ran away

  quickly the news of the tragedy
spread over the village deputy sheriff
jim wade heard it just after his break-
fast and at once telephoned to his chief
sheriff luther hawley in his office in
millsburg the county seat twenty miles
away he knew hawley would be com-
ing over just as fast as he could drive
his car over bad roads the deputy got
to the marland house in less than half
an hour after the maids gruesome dis-
covery he had not been there many
moments before he found a clew that
startled him he was quite sure it
would startle his chief too

  wade had found out everything that
servants seemed able to tell when the
sheriff a big long-limbed powerful-
looking man with an air of authority
made his way past the little crowd of
villagers and farmers who drawn there
by curiosity had gathered in front of
the house hawley came hurrying up
the steps and at the door found his
deputy waiting for him

  tell me all you know jim the
sheriff demanded i was so anxious
to beat it over here quick that i couldnt
wait to get the details from you on the
phone

  wade led his chief into the room
where marlands body remained in the
chair at the desk just as the maid had
found it the little lamp was still burn-
ing the window was still wide open

 ds-c

the pen was still lying at the dead mans
feet apparently nothing had been dis-
turbed since the finding of the body

  i havent had a chance to talk with
miss marland yet said wade but i
found out from the butler that just be-
fore she went to bed last night her
father was sitting here writing and that
he said good night to her that was
about ten oclock it was about eight
this morning when the maid found him
everythings just the way it was then
ive got a couple of men outside keep-
ing folks away from some footprints
lucky i got here quick enough to save
those tracks from being walked over

  footprints eh exclaimed hawley
raising his shaggy eyebrows

  shoe prints to be exact said wade
step over there to that window and
see for yourself

  the sheriff went to the open window
near the desk and looked out showing
clearly in the moist earth of a flower
bed which extended along the wall of
the house were the prints of rubber
soles with fancy designs the window
was not too far above the ground for
a man outside to climb in without a
great deal of effort but there was no
indication here that a man had climbed
in-only that he had climbed out

  those prints all lead one way jim
the sheriff observed away from the
window how did the cuss get in

  through the open window in the
next room chief replied wade the
same kind of shoe prints are down below
it in that garden only they lead to the
house from outside the man could
see marland at the desk but he didnt
want to be seen himself so he went to
that other window sneaked through that
room without a sound on his rubber
soles and the instant he stepped from
behind the door curtain he was near
enough to marlands back to strike the
blow

  luther hawley stroked his square
chin thoughtfully find any shoe


detective story magazine

prints on the floor of that next room
he asked

  only some little spots of earth a
rug covers most of that floor he didnt
track any earth into this room because
by the time he got here the rug had
wiped it off of his shoes

  slowly the sheriff turned to look
around the room marlands library was
not impressive books covered only a
small part of the wall space the room
was small and simply furnished
against the bright sunshine pouring in
through the open window the light of
the little lamp looked wan and feeble
im afraid were a long way from find-
ing out who did this job jim he re-
marked gloomily

  ive got a feeling that were a whole
lot nearer to it than you think chief
his deputy returned we can have
plaster casts of those shoe prints and
theres evidence that the man was left-
handed take a look at that hilt stick-
ing out of marlands back and youll
see what i mean the blades driven in
two inches to the left of his spine and
down near his heart the hilt slants out
toward the left and close against the
left side of the chair is the wall a
right-handed man would have struck on
the other side of the spine and the hilt
would have a slant toward the right

  toward the right and also upward
hawley amended

  not necessarily said wade mar-
land was probably leaning far forward
over his work in that case a killer in-
stead of reaching far over the tall back
of the chair and striking from above
would have found it easier to bend his
knees a little and strike around the back
of the chair from his hip in that case
the hilt would be almost horizontal with
the floor just as it is now it was cer-
tainly a left-handed blow chief you
cant reason that fact away

  sheriff hawley nodded his approval
you can step to the head of the class
jim youre a bright young fella

  the deputy had been holding back a
surprise to reveal at some moment when
it would be most effective he felt that
that moment had now arrived and i
can show you something else to prove
that the killer was left-handed he an-
nounced narrowing his eyes at hawley
something thats going to give you a
jolt chief

  as hawley was staring at him with a
puzzled frown wade produced a small
pocket memorandum book with the name
samuel e burke printed in gilt let-
ters on its morocco cover thats
leftys he whispered i found it
lying on the floor up against this open
window

  lefty burke exclaimed hawley
with a start oh no jim i cant
believe hes guilty of this job

  im not accusing him-not yet said
wade but that book is his all right
its full of scribbled memoranda and i
recognized the handwriting maybe
hell be able to offer some explanation
plausible enough to make things look
less black for him but all the same i
think wed better take a look at leftys
shoes its certainly strange that that
book should be found here under that
window only a few steps from the body
when marland as everybody around
here knows has forbidden him the
house

  it would take considerable to make
me believe lefty burke did this the
sheriff declared shaking his head sadly
it was probably the work of a sneak
thief jim

  wade gave a nod of assent it cer-
tainly was chief for marland has been
robbed

  of what  the sheriff demanded with
a little upward jerk of his head

  money ferguson the cashier of
the bank came around here cross lots a
little while ago from his home on the
other side of the hill he thought id
be interested to learn that marland drew
fifteen hundred dollars from the bank
branctof the fetters



yesterday there isnt any safe in this
house marland always kept his money
in his pocketbook in an inside pocket of
his coat that pocketbook has disap-
peared its hard to believe lefty would
commit murder merely to steal fifteen
hundred dollars but chief ive got to
remind you that marlands death may
bring burkes reach nearer fifteen mil-
lions than fifteen hundreds remem-
ber hes engaged to marlands daughter
and the old man has threatened that if
she married him hed cut her off with-
out a cent he cant cut her off now
the millions are already hers she can
marry lefty burke whenever she wants
to

  hawley gave a shrug of his heavy
shoulders jim i hope youre not hint-
ing that jane marland might have had
something to do with this job

  not hinting anything against any-
body his deputy assured him bluntly
just stating facts thats all

  would a man aiming at millions
waste time looking for a pocketbook
said hawley

  he might wade insisted if he
was in desperate need of a little money
its common talk that leftys up against
it hard that hes in debt that sometimes
he cant even pay his hotel bill

  though luther hawley knew most
of the people of northboro he lived too
far away to hear much of the latest gos-
sip about their private affairs and this
information seemed to surprise him i
didnt know that he muttered gravely
and after a moment he added i think
we ought to have a talk with jane mar-
land

  well i wanted to returned wade
but shes naturally all broken up over
this and the butler said she ought not
to be disturbed whats happened to
your finger-print man chief with his
camera 

  hawley was proud of his finger-print
outfit which he had recently persuaded
parsimonious county supervisors to buy

for him and in his haste to get away
to northboro he hadnt forgotten about
it hell be over pretty soon i guess
lie answered i couldnt wait for him
but we wont find any prints on the hilt
of that knife its rough bone theres
not a smooth spot on it after hes
hunted for finger prints he can photo-
graph those shoe prints outside and
then well make plaster casts of them
but im going to see jane marland
right now jim no matter how bad she
feels

  with a look of fierce determination
the sheriff started off to look for the
butler wade followed him as they
stepped into the big square entrance hall
in front of the house hawley stopped
abruptly for to his surprise he had
caught sight of jane marland whom he
was so eager to interview coming down
the broad staircase as might have
been expected she still showed signs of
the shock her fathers death must
have been to her but though she was
very pale and her eyes were swollen and
tear stained she seemed to have her-
self under firm control

  as she reached the foot of the stairs
hawley stepped forward to intercept
her i dont like to trouble you at
such a time miss marland he ex-
plained softly but before i go any
further with this case there are some
questions ive got to ask you

  there were but few people in the
county who did not know luther haw-
ley at least by sight and the girl recog-
nized him for a moment she studied
his face anxiously and seemed uncertain
what answer to make what is it you
want to ask me she said at last

  i want to know whether you saw
lefty burke here last night he re-
plied grimly

  the girl quick to sense the suspicion
in his mind gave a slight start his
sharp searching look seemed to shake
her nerves i-i dort understand
what you mean sheriff she stammered

after a moment surely you dont

think-

  the sentence remained unfinished
and she stared past him through the
wide-open front door to a handsome
smartly dressed man who had just come
up the steps you must excuse me
sheriff she said quickly there is
somebody i must see at once

  as she hurried to the door hawley
swung around to see who was there he
had never seen the man before but
wade had seen him several times and
had heard his name he recognized
him now as archibald ely nash

chapter vii

lefty burkes shoes

s the circumstances seemed to de-
mand of him nashs face was very
grave and his manner subdued as he
grasped the welcoming hand jane mar-
land extended in welcome

  it was good of you to come she
murmured

  i couldnt stay away he said look-
ing sadly into her eyes i scarcely ex-
pected to see you but i felt that i must
call and at least leave my name and my
deepest sympathy

  nash who had developed his natural
social gifts by careful study of the ways
of the fashionable world was one of the
most tactful of men though he was
eager for information concerning the
ghostly happening of the night before
he waited silently for the girl herself
to speak of it of her own volition he
did not have long to wait for as he
stepped into the hall jane whispered
to him that big man at the foot of
the stairs is sheriff hawley and im
afraid he means to make himself very
disagreeable i dont want to speak
with him for some reason or other
i believe he suspects lefty only a
moment ago he asked me if he was
here last night

the man must be a fool nash mut-

tered dont worry about burke but
if i were you id answer the sheriffs
questions if you dont you will only
increase whatever suspicion he may
have

  oh i am so glad you are here she
exclaimed under her breath if you
will stay by me ill talk with the man
and wont feel so much afraid of him

  leading nash over to the foot of the
stairs she introduced him to the sheriff
mr nash is a good friend of mine
she explained and he thinks i ought
to answer whatever questions you want
to ask i might as well tell you right
now that i didnt see lefty burke here
last night-that he hasnt been here for
weeks

  no said hawley incredulously
he turned his eyes to nash ive just
been told by mr wade here that youre
staying at the tavern did you see
burke last night

  for a moment nash kept an awk-
ward silence see here sheriff i dont
want to say anything that might get
burke mixed up in this affair he burst
out his face full of trouble

  which means i suppose that you
do know something that might mix him
up in it the sheriff persisted with
keener interest tell me the truth
nash its bound to come out some
time you did see burke last night
where and when

  nash hesitated over his reply its
better to tell what little i know he de-
cided suddenly its impossible that
burke could have been connected with
such a terrible crime as this and no
matter what i or anybody else can say
his innocence is sure to come out usu-
ally i go out for a little stroll before
going to bed last night about eleven
oclock i was passing the marland
grounds and was nearing the gate when
i saw burke coming toward me i
spoke to him but he didnt answer

  did he come out of that gate
hawley demanded quickly
brand of the fetters



  i dont suppose so i dont know
where he came from

  the sheriffs eyes were bright with
suddenly aroused excitement jim
lets see that book he snapped he
reached out and seized the pocket
memorandum book that wade pro-
duced look at the name on this
miss marland it was found this morn-
ing lying on the floor just inside the
open window of the library it belongs
to burke can you explain how it got
there

  jane looked at the name on the cover
and gasped why its impossible she
cried her eyes wide with amazement
he hasnt been here i tell you for
weeks

  for several seconds hawley stared
into her face without a word well
all right he sighed at last plainly
doubting her well let it go at that
but jim go find lefty burke and
bring him here and if he isnt wear-
ing shoes with fancy rubber soles go
to his room and look for a pair that has

j 

em

  as wade passed out of the house
nash noticed that the girls nerves were
in a bad state and he turned to her
with a look of sympathy come away
miss marland you cant stand any
more of this

  no no she cried ive got to
see this through ive got to wait here
for lefty

  though it had seemed certain that if
lefty were in the village he would be
found very quickly it proved to be a
long wait but at last they saw him com-
ing up the steps of the house in charge
of the deputy apparently wade had
not taken any shoes from leftys room
for there was nothing in his hands the
young real-estate dealer looked com-
pletely bewildered as he stepped into
the house and saw the three persons
who were waiting there for him his
eyes widened and he stared blankly at
their grave faces

  well jim snapped the sheriff im-
patiently whats the answer

  wade scowled knowing burke i
hate to say it chief but those shoes hes
wearing seem to have the kind of soles
we want but well know in a minute
wed better take him around outside to
those prints under the windows
presently as the two officers led
burke out of the house and around to-
ward the garden in the rear jane mar-
land started to follow them nash
protested for he could see that she was
under an intense strain but she per-
sisted stubbornly and they went along
together to the spot marked by the steps
of the man who some time in the dead
of night had come to marlands library
as they arrived at the garden bed where
the footprints were so clearly visible
lefty with the two officers standing be-
side him was sitting on the ground tak-
ing off his shoes

  with fast-growing impatience haw-
ley seized the first shoe to come off and
holding it carefully over one of the
footprints in the earth found that it
fitted the mark exactly he turned the
shoe over and studied the design of
circles and crosses on the sole it was
a design that had its exact counter-part
in the imprint in the earth even to the
places where the rubber had been
slightly worn away by use

  jane marland saw everything she
saw how perfectly the sole of leftys
shoe fitted the imprint and suddenly
all her sympathy for the young man she
was engaged to marry vanished
you she cried staring at him with
flashing eyes i couldnt believe it i
never could have believed but for this
her voice sank into a sobbing whisper
but now-now i know

  stepping up to burke sheriff haw-
ley pointed a long accusing finger into
his face tell the truth he roared
you did it you cant deny it youre
the man who crept into this house last
night and killed andrew j marland


detective story magazine

theres no getting away from it burke
look at this he held up the little
memorandum book before leftys eyes
its yours it was found inside that
open window

  lefty tried to speak but the words
caught in his throat his eyes with a
wild baffled look in them now turned
to jane her nerves had broken at last
and she was sobbing bitterly archibald
ely nash had fondly thrown a long
slender arm around her shoulders-the
arm with the wrist watch

chapter viii

the clinching story

 ver since the days when they had
been friends and classmates in
school lorna sherwood had cherished
a romantic attachment for lefty burke
nobody ever suspected it not even
lefty himself she would never have
dared speak of it to anybody but that
little secret love affair coming into her
drab life had made the world brighter
for her had lifted her thoughts above
the dull routine of household chores and
her work in her fathers store

  to her quiet brown eyes lefty was
a hero a wonder man the embodiment
of all the gifts the gods have to offer
to poor humanity she hadnt seen him
very often of late but she liked to let
her thoughts wander back to the old
winter days when he had drawn her to
school on his sled and to the old sum-
mers when they had gone to the mill
pond together and he had taught her
how to swim and to fish and to row a
boat even now he was her idol

  she had never really believed he
would ever fall in love with her for
she did not rate herself very highly and
she had accepted his engagement to
jane marland without a touch of bit-
terness it was the greatest shock of
her life when lefty was arrested for
the murder of jane marlands father
the whole village might believe him

guilty in fact most of the village did
believe so already but she herself would
never doubt him no matter what the
evidence might be

  lorna had formed some specific ideas
of her own concerning the murder of
marland and these ideas all directed
her suspicion to one man that man
was archibald ely nash she had felt
a sudden dislike for the adonis of the
tavern the very moment she first set
eyes on him a keenly intuitive girl
she had been quick to sense the evil na-
ture that lurked behind the disguise of
his handsome alluring face a logical
process of reasoning told her that nash
had plenty of motive not only for kill-
ing marland but for fastening the crime
on lefty she knew that jane was
ignoring lefty in his cell in the village
jail that she had turned against him
and that nash was paying her devoted
attention

  marland who would have bitterly
opposed the smooth strangers wooing
of his daughter was out of the way
and lefty was no longer to be feared
that nash might have had strong rea-
son to get rid of both men was obvious
to lorna but apparently to nobody else
now that her father was dead the
headstrong jane was her own boss
she could - see nash wherever and
whenever she pleased lefty was no
longer an obstacle to be reckoned with
for the adonis of the tavern the way
was clear and tactful sympathetic of
polished manners and clever speech he
was making the best of his opportuni-
ties

  two other men besides nash were
the recipients of lornas bitter ani-
mosity-sheriff hawley and his deputy
jim wade she was convinced that the
two officers were prejudiced against
their prisoner and were ignoring every
fact that might point to his innocence
she had to acknowledge to herself
however that those facts were very
few and seemed to be completely out-
brand of the fetters



weighed by the evidence that had been
presented and that was continuing to
accumulate against her idol the case
of the prosecution was even stronger
now than at the time of leftys arrest
for the weapon with which marland had
been killed had been identified as
leftys hunting knife

  leftys own story was too fantastic
for general belief he had told at last
of how he had been attacked in his of-
fice and left bound and unconscious
he had argued that his shoes could have
been removed from his feet at that time
without his knowledge that they could
have been worn by his assailant to mar-
lands house and then after the mur-
der could have been put back on his
own feet and he had explained how
easy it would have been for anybody
to steal his hunting knife from his room
in the tavern but the village was
laughing at the prisoners incredible
story and convinced at last that he
was the unfortunate victim of a perfect
frame-up he had given way to absolute
despair

  lorna was feeling pretty desperate
herself almost convinced of nashs
guilt she had been seeking some way
of launching an attack upon him that
would bring him under general suspi-
cion she had been watching him like
a hawk at every opportunity remem-
bering all the details of the murder she
had hoped to find he was left-handed
in that effort she had been sharply dis-
appointed for the evidence all seemed
to point the other way she had found
that he wrote with his right hand and
seemed to use it at all times in prefer-
ence to his left

  the morning of the day after leftys
arrest nash called on seth sherwood
in his little office in the rear of the store
after the man had gone lorna ob-
serving her fathers agitation was
deeply perplexed she had not forgot-
ten how troubled her father had seemed
after the first visit nash had paid him

and now the same thing had happened
again

  a few hours later sheriff hawley
came into the store ignoring lorna he
passed on into the office where he found
sherwood at his desk

  i hear youve been looking for me
that youve got something important
to tell hawley began

  the storekeeper was looking thor-
oughly miserable his face was white
and drawn and his weak eyes were full
of anxiety im afraid i have he an-
swered drawing a hand across his fore-
head ive hated to tell you hawley
and its all i can do to bring myself to
it now for ive known lefty burke
for years and have never heard any-
thing against him

  hawley glanced at him with sud-
denly quickened interest so you
know something against burke eh
what is it

  i-i saw him hawley that night
that marland was killed the store-
keeper stammered with very obvious re-
luctance he paused frowned and bit
at his lips as if he already repented his
words

  go on sherwood when and where
did you see him

  you know my house isnt very far
from the marland grounds sherwood
resumed with an effort well there
was a letter i had forgotten to open and
i had left it here in my desk i didnt
think of it till late in the evening and
then it began to worry me i thought
it might be something important and
i felt that i couldnt sleep till i had
looked at it so i came down here and
got it i was on my way home and
was almost there when i saw a man
climbing over the marland wall he
dropped to the path right in front of
me it was burke my eyesight isnt
very good but i was so close i couldnt
mistake him it must have been about
eleven oclock and i asked him what
he was doing out so late in the mar-


detective story magazine

land grounds he didnt seem to be
quite himself he seemed dazed he
told me a rambling story about how he
had been drinking some bootleg whisky
and he said he hadnt any idea how he
got into marlands grounds i left him
there and went on home

  for a few moments the sheriff pon-
dered the old mans story in silence
until at last a slow smile lit up his
face weve got him sherwood
weve got him dead to rights now
thats the clinching story it means a
death sentence for lefty burke

  the smile was lingering on the sher-
iffs face when a little later leaving
sherwood at his desk he stepped out
into the store hawley was a change-
able sort of man though he had not
been ready to believe in leftys guilt
at first after he was convinced of it
by the evidence of the shoes his former
friendly feeling for the young real-es-
tate dealer turned into contempt and he
had been finding a grim satisfaction in
the accumulating evidence in his
cheerful frame of mind he did not
ignore lorna after leaving her fathers
office she was standing behind one of
the counters and he stopped to speak to
her

  what are you smiling so happily
about sheriff she asked

  ive just heard some pretty good
news lorna he replied your fa-
thers been talking with me about leftv
burke

  lorna could scarcely conceal her sud-
den excitement but she made an effort
to show indifference oh i can guess
what hes been telling- you she said
with a shrug he doesnt keep any
secrets from me

  that so the sheriff was in a
talkative mood and he had no very
strong reason for keeping his fresh in-
formation to himself it would come
out in court pretty soon and he thought
that probably the girl had heard the
story from her father already so you

know about lefty climbing over the
marland wall on the night of the mur-
der

  lornas wits were wide awake i
heard something about it just what did
my father tell you his memory isnt
very good and perhaps i can supply
some details hes forgotten

  why he told me about how he came
down here to the store late that night
to get something and on his way home
saw burke climbing out of the mar-
land grounds lefty told him hed been
drinking and didnt know how he got
there its the clinching story lorna
coming from a man of your fathers im-
portance in the village what he says
a jury will believe we dont need any-
thing more -now to convict burke of
first-degree murder

  lorna believed that hawley for some
reason she could not fathom was lying
to her it was impossible for her to
believe her father had told such a story
but she was trembling when presently
the sheriff passed out into the street
she rushed into the office father
what did you tell the sheriff just now
she demanded

  oh nothing of any importance
lorna he replied nervously

  he says you saw lefty climbing
over the marland wall that night he
says you told him so

  sherwood knew the whole village
would know his story before long he
wouldnt be able to keep it from lorna
much longer i had to tell him what
i saw he muttered turning his eyes
away from her

  you told him that

  yes-told him everything

  you deliberately told him that
father why did you have to tell such
a lie for it was a lie you were with
me at home all that evening you know
you were you didnt leave the house
for a moment

  sherwood looked as if he were in
agony lorna he cried desperately
brand of the fetters



i had to tell that story theres a
reason i cant talk about

  a reason for telling a lie that will
convict lefty of murder

  sherwood had reached the limit of
endurance suddenly his quivering
nerves seemed to break and a long-
drawn sob broke from his lips as he
covered his bowed face with his hands
i was forced to tell it he whimpered
yes forced theres nothing about
my past life that i must hide from you
lorna but ive got to stick to that lie
or spend the rest of my life in prison
his long shirt sleeve had slipped back
from his right wrist exposing the brand
of the handcuff lorna several times
before had seen that ugly strange scar
and had often wondered about it but
she stared at it now with fresh curiosity
for years she had suspected that there
was some cloud over her fathers past
but not until this moment had she felt
certain that archibald ely nash was
connected with it

  was it nash who forced you to tell
that lie she demanded

  hes been squeezing money from
me lorna to-day he came and prom-
ised hed never ask me for another dol-
lar if id tell that story about burke
but if i refused hed expose me would
tell everything he knew about me im
helpless lorna and so are you if
you tell that i lied it will be the end of
me ive got to testify against burke
in court or nash will have me sent to
prison for twenty years

  into his daughters face came a look
of fierce determination such as he had
never seen there before her eyes
flashed and her little fists were clenched
tightly father would prison be any
worse than the torment youd have all
the rest of your life when you realized
youd told a lie that had sent an inno-
cent man to death youve got to tell
the truth if you dont ill have a story
of my own to tell in court-a true
story

chapter ix

the saving lie

the convetous hands of archibald
ely nash were drawing closer and
closer to the marland millions the
woolen kings will disclosed the fact
that he had left to his daughter his en-
tire estate moreover the fact that the
mysterious adonis of the tavern of
whose past life nobody seemed to know
anything at all had completely won
jane marlands affections was becoming
obvious to the whole village the spell
that nash exercised over the girl was
almost hypnotic he knew that after
she had become his wife he would find
a way of doing as he pleased with her
property he had already made the
pleasing discovery that jane didnt have
much of a head for business the
tragicdeath of marland and the pitiful
plight of burke did not cause him any
loss of sleep in fact he was able to
find amusement in the thought that
while his former rival for janes affec-
tions was behind prison bars and would
probably never be free again he him-
self could look forward to a life of lux-
urious ease

  not only had lefty been abandoned
by jane marland in his time of trouble
but by almost everybody in the village
he had begun to believe that not one
human being believed in his innocence
and that he was doomed to die against
the mass of evidence pointing to his
guilt he felt that his case was hope-
less he scarcely expected that any-
body would come to see him in his
lonely prison through mere friendship
or sympathy or faith in him and when
one morning he discovered lorna sher-
wood standing at the door of his cell
his heart leaped

  oh lefty i simply had to come to
tell you i still believe in you no matter
what people are saying she burst out
with a little sob

  he had scarcely spoken with lorna


detective story magazine

for months hut now suddenly his
thoughts went back to the old days when
they were boy and girl together and the
realization that there was as least one
human being who believed in him gave
him a thrill dear little lorna he
cried youre the truest friend ive
got in the world you always did be-
lieve in me when we were kids to-
gether you thought i was going to be
a great man some day ive been an
awful disappointment havent i it
looks as if theyd got me there doesnt
seem to be any hope for me at all right
now

  i cant stay long she hastened to
tell him the jailer wont let me but
i dont want you to give up hoping
ive thought of a way to help you i
cant tell you what it is but its some-
thing that may set you free

  for a moment lefty stared out at
her through the bars with wondering
eyes then he gave a bitter little laugh
why poor little girl theres nothing
that can set me free nothing that you
could do anyhow

  youre wrong lefty she insisted
you dont know what im thinking
about i really have found a way

  she was so very serious about it and
seemed so confident that his curiosity
was stirred tell me lorna he
urged you dont mean youve found
some kind of evidence thats been over-
looked

  but i cant tell you she returned
with a frowrn and then after a mo-
ment of thought she added but yes
ill tell you this much that im going to
lie for you lefty yes thats what im
going to do im going to tell a lie that
will smash that whole case of luther
hawleys to smithereens

  and presently leaving lefty com-
pletely bewildered she went away to
look for sheriff hawley at the town
hall where he made his headquarters
during his stay in the village she
found him before long at an opportune

moment for he was alone in a little
room where he had a desk

  i never expected youd honor me
with a visit he told her gallantly
whats on your mind lorna got
something to add to your fathers
story 

  theres not a word of truth in my
fathers story she returned looking
hawley squarely in the eyes he told
me himself it was a lie and before
long hes going to be telling you the
same thing youll never have him
as a witness against lefty burke

  hawley was startled a lie he
exclaimed why lorna its hard to
believe you why would he tell such a
lie as that

  because that man archibald ely
nash told him to she answered
promptly hes a blackmailer he
knows about something-i dont know
what-connected with my fathers past
and hes been holding it over him hes
been squeezing money from him nash
promised that hed never ask him for
another dollar if father would tell that
story and father had to tell it for he
knew that if he didnt something ter-
rible would happen to him sheriff
ive come to tell you youve been on the
wrong track in this case right from the
start you fell for the neatest frame-
up that was ever put over on an inno-
cent man you never could see that
nash had a bigger motive than any-
body in the world for killing mr mar-
land he wras after marlands daugh-
ter and marlands millions and he had
to frame lefty to get him out of the
way

  now-now lorna the sheriff pro-
tested you ought not to say things
like that you cant accuse nash with-
out any more evidence than the fact
that hes on friendly terms with jane
marland

  ive got more evidence than that
lorna assured him ive got evidence
mr hawley thats going to make you
brand of the fetters



do a lot of deep thinking pretty soon
you never found the money that disap-
peared from mr marlands pocket did
you

  the sheriff seemed to be slightly puz-
zled i dont see what youre trying
to show he said scowling and strok-
ing his chin weve got all the case
we need against burke even if we never
find that money

  lorna was in no hurry to satisfy his
curiosity the last time mr fergu-
son the bank cashier was in the store
she said he told me that money was
in brand-new bills and that he happened
to remember the numbers because the
first four figures of the first number
were the date of his birth and the rest
were ciphers of course when he had
the number of the bill on the top of the
pack in his mind he knew what the
numbers of the others were for in a
new pack they ran consecutively
yes weve got the numbers haw-
ley admitted but what of it

  just this mr hawley ive got
some of that money and i know the
man who paid it to me in the store
from her purse she took a new
fifty-dollar bill and held it before the
sheriffs eyes do you remember the
number sheriff its one of those
thats on your list

  hawleys eyes widened where did
that come from he demanded nerv-
ously

  from archibald ely nash lorna
answered this morning he bought
some handkerchiefs in the store he
said that was the smallest money hed
got so i had to change it for him it
seems to me sheriff that its up to you
to take a look inside nashs pocketbook
where you may find twenty-nine other
new fifty-dollar bills

  the sheriff was too deep in thought
to speak the whole structure of the
case he had built up so carefully against
lefty burke seemed suddenly threat-
ened with destruction presently he

rose from his chair i think ill take
your advice lorna he said sheepishly
im going out right now to look for
that man nash

  what happened subsequently-the
finding of the remainder of the miss-
ing money in nashs room the arrest
of nash for murder seth sherwoods
confession that his story of seeing
burke climbing marlands wall was a
lie-were a sensational series of events
in the history of northboro the send-
ing of nashs finger prints to the police
of the big cities of the country re-
sulted in the discovery of his criminal
career and of the fact that he was
wanted as a swindler in several places
the faith of the village in lefty re-
turned with surprising suddenness and
his story was no longer doubted in
fact in the light of what had been dis-
covered about nash the story seemed
so perfectly plausible from beginning
to end that people began to wonder why
luther hawley and jim wade had
ignored it so completely presumably
nash had gone to marlands house in
leftys shoes taking with him leftys
hunting knife and memorandum book
the finding of a blackjack among
nashs possessions provided a theory
that he had first knocked marland un-
conscious with a blow on the head and
that he had then had time to strike a
blow with the knife that would appear
to have been dealt by a left-handed man
of course there was no proof of this
and there never would be unless nash
should confess but the smooth-
tongued adventurer was not that kind
of a man there was only one con-
fession he made-suicide and thats
confession enough to satisfy anybody
observed luther hawley

  to find himself suddenly facing the
certainty of conviction either for mar-
lands murder or on many other charges
when his hands had been so close to
millions had been too much of a shock
to the adonis of the tavern he was


detective story magazine

found hanging from the bars of his cell
in a strangling noose which be had made
from strips of bedclothing

  when at last lefty burke was set
free he went at once to seth sher-
woods store where he found lorna
alone

  can you guess why ive come here
little girl he asked her

  no lefty i dont think i can she
answered looking up into his face and
trying to keep back the tears that were
brimming in her browm eyes

  he took her into his big arms and
held her close and presently he
whispered into her ear i know now
that ive always loved you lorna-ever
since we were kids

  but im an awful liar lefty she
sobbed it wasnt nash who gave me
that fifty-dollar bill it was mr mar-
land

  she was still in leftys arms when
seth sherwood stepped out of his of-
fice and blinked curiously at them from
behind his spectacles but there was

no sign of recognition in his weak eyes
until he had drawn very near then
he saw how things were between his
daughter and lefty burke and he
smiled happily without saying a
word he went back to his office he
no longer feared any immediate expos-
ure of his past archibald ely nash
too busy with his own troubles to have
room in his mind for any petty spite
had failed to betray him and luther
hawley whatever he might suspect
had not the least desire to dig back into
the years in an effort to bring ruin to
one of northboros leading citizens

  for a long time the old man sat
dreaming at his desk at last he
opened his eyes pulled back the sleeve
of his shirt and stared wide-eyed at
the scar on his wrist the brand of
the fetters he whispered to himself
ill never be free from that some
day they may find me and theyll know
me by that mark its my punishment
with that mark fear will always be
with me to the end of my life

struggle that they bad no idea they were being surrounded by the law even the
lookouts left their posts and crept nearer the scene of activity suddenly there
came a warning cry and the lights went out a few escaped but the majority
were captured and arrested practically all of them gave fictitious names and
tendered ten dollars for bail they wrere charged with misdemeanor it was said

return

after a long absence our old friend the
master confidence man is with us again

ft

   by christopher b booth

author of the moving hand etc

mt ten oclock on a certain
tuesday morning in novem-
i yrlj ber mr amos clackworthy
 was a millionaire before
two oclock of the same afternoon he
owed money to his brokers between
those frantic hours which so many
thousands of people will remember with
shudders as the first day of the stock-
market crash mr clackworthy saw his
paper profits melt and vanish his mar-
gins swept away with such relentless
swiftness that there had been no chance
of salvage

  being a philosopher and a good sport
having the nerve of the gambler who
can lose his last chip without losing his

serenity the master confidence man ac-
cepted this reversal of his fortunes with-
out lament while others who had lost
less were tragically contemplating self-
destruction-and some of them making
this surrender to their desperation-mr
clackworthy merely mixed himself a
high ball lighted one of his excellent
cigars and reached the immediate deci-
sion that it was time he got back to his
business of trimming suckers having
himself been a sucker to the tune of a
cool million

  immediate activity was necessary if
he meant to remain a tenant of this
exclusive lakeshore drive apartment
for the november rent was due and to


detective story magazine

pay it would reduce his bank account to
an alarmingly small balance it was an
exceedingly satisfactory place to live
with a roof-top terrace and an unob-
structed view of the lake and he meant
to keep it but the apartment cost
money and mr clackworthys tastes
were expensively in keeping with his
abode money must be had and
quickly too

  the door of the luxurious living room
was abruptly flung open and james
early the master confidence mans con-
federate in their many successful adven-
tures burst in stormily but it was the
storm of despair clutched in his hand
was a crumpled copy of a chicago after-
noon newspaper with the news of the
stock-market crash screaming across the
front page upon his thin lean sharp-
featured face was stamped an expres-
sion of dazed anguish which however
began to relax as he saw mr clack-
worthy sitting at ease apparently in a
cheerful and carefree mood

  good afternoon james said mr
clackworthy pleasantly you appear
to be a trifle upset over something

  james early upon whom the police in
days past had bestowed his nickname of
the early bird stared searchingly at
the master confidence man for another
moment a look of something akin to
awe began to spread over his counte-
nance

  boss he gasped out you-you
got out with a whole skin huh this
here wall street game didnt make a
sucker outa you after all gee boss
you sure outsmarted the rest of this
whole cockeyed world howdja do it

  i didnt responded mr clack-
worthy no my dear james i cer-
tainly didnt

  the early birds expanding smile
began to lose radiance but viewing the
others calmness he could not believe
that disaster had been complete mr
clackworthy james decided had been
nicked but not very badly

  youre lucky at that boss why i
seen guys down in the loop that was
stripped right down to their shirts
lookit th headlines heres a bird that
puts a hunk of lead inside the place his
brains was supposed to be another one
does a high-divin act offn th monmouth
buildin the streets downtown is full
of people talkin to theirselves and the
nut ward at cook county hospital is
dustin off the old s r o sign and
gettin ready to sleep em three in a bed
i hears a street sweeper sayin to th
blind dame what peddles lead pencils
at the corner of clark and randolph
that his broker had sold him out and
lady smoked glasses comes back that
she lost five centuries in radio every-
body was playin this crazy market-
everybody includin you and me worse
luck

  mr clackworthy chuckled enjoying
as he always did the early birds pic-
turesque outbursts of speech and the
chuckle further falsely reassured the
early bird that his friend and idol had
shrewdly escaped the tidal wave of liqui-
dation

  so james youve been speculating
along with the rest of us

  yeah and heres a laugh a wise
bozo ini lasalle street slips me a hot
tip that zenith vacuum cleaner was
gonna be pushed up to a hundred and
fifty it vacuum-cleaned me all right
i aint got a bean left outa th wreck
and that aint speakin in no figurative
language neither im so flat boss that
a pancake would look like pikes peak
the early bird stripped off his nobby
english overcoat and sat down expect-
antly

  aw loosen up boss he pleaded
gimme a tell howdja manage to get
into th cyclone cellar before th tornado
struck and why oh why didntcha
give me a tip-off mebbe i could have
saved a part of my twenty-seven grand

  you dont seem to believe that im
cleaned out too james said mr
mr clackworthys return



clackworthy as he gently tapped an inch
and a half of ash from his cigar

   nix on tryin to hand me that stuff
boss he exclaimed disdainfully why
if you was clean that would mean
mighty near a million bucks and no
guy not even you can say good-by to
that much dough and look like merry
christmas so quit kiddin me and
gimme th low-down

  mr clackworthy got up from his
chair produced another glass and
mixed two drinks

   it pleases me to discover that i am
such a game loser he said the
truth of the matter is james that mar-
ket prices dropped so fast this afternoon
there was no chance for any man to save
himself one stock i was in dropped
thirty points in an hour and a half the
others were nearly as bad im all in
down and out james im in debt to my
brokers and i wouldnt be able to pay
them what i owe and meet this months
rent on the apartment

   the early birds mouth sagged open
for a moment he was like a man petri-
fied it was extremely difficult to fit
mr amos clackworthy into any picture
of poverty knocking at the door and yet
he knew now that it must really be true
mr clackworthy was broke stony
broke

  a million bucks cried the early
bird in a shaking whisper a million
bucks gone-just like this and he
puffed to imitate a gust of wind b-but
boss it-it cant be-as bad as that
down to the last dollar

  the master confidence mans mouth
tightened slightly ah but it is james
ive been close to the ragged edge more
than once but never never in my life
have i actually owed money that i
couldnt pay it puts me in a prettv bad
hole

   a wabbly smile sickly in its lack of
mirth spread over the early birds
face

   for a couple of wise guys like you

and me were certainly a fine pair of
suckers two nice woolly marys little
lambs whats gone and got ourselves
fleeced right down to the bare skin
his voice had become bitter

  weve got a lot of company ob-
served mr clackworthy but the early
bird found small consolation in that
philosophy isnt a great deal of com-
fort when apartment rent is due and the
figures of the check-book stubs have
been reduced to three figures

  it proves said mr clackworthy as
he sat down again and took a sip of his
second high ball an old adage of mine
that the sucker is a sucker for one rea-
son and one reason only-because hes
trying to get something for nothing
weve demonstrated it many times
weve merely demonstrated it again with
ourselves in the role of victims we
tried to take some easy money out of
wall street we were greedy as men
usually are when theres easy money in
sight with you twenty-seven thou-
sand wasnt enough with me a million
wasnt enough both of us wanted
more and we got it-

  we got it the early bird chimed
in dismally in the place where were
both gonna be wearin patches on our
pants

   mr clackworthy finished off his high
ball perhaps underneath his magnifi-
cent calm his nerves needed to be
bucked up but a better tonic un-
doubtedly was the early birds familiar
note of pessimism it was like old
times again to hear this prediction of
dire disaster which was to put them on
the street in rags and tatters the
master confidence man threw back his
head and laughed heartily

  wheres all the comedy grunted
james early sourly

  really james i wonder if you do
expect to see me in the bread line

  whatcha gonna do answer me
that there was a challenge in the
early birds voice although of course


detective story magazine

he didnt actually expect the master con-
fidence man ever to be reduced to any
such pitiful degree of destitution

  do murmured mr clackworthy
that my dismal friend is a question
easily answered you and i are going
to dust off the old bag of tricks and get
back to business to-days stock-mar-
ket debacle impresses me with the cheer-
ing thought of how many thousands of
people there are who are trying to get
something for nothing

  a bright sparkle lighted the early
birds eyes only to dim

  theres plenty of suckers left he
muttered but try and find one of the
poor saps whos got any jack

  mr cackworthys answer to that was
to slide open a drawer of his desk and
bring forth a small card-index file
which contained the names of various
and sundry persons who unknown to
themselves were candidate for election
to membership in the master confidence
mans own private lodge the ancient
order of suckers

  from out of the little magic box
which mr clackworthy called the pros-
pect list there came the name of a cer-
tain mr alonzo prindivale upon the
card devoted to mr prindivale there
appeared such information as the master
confidence man might find useful in his
particular field of endeavor by a series
of cryptograms a great deal was con-
tained in a small space and mr prindi-
vale would not have felt flattered to have
heard this condensed biography trans-
lated to its full meaning

  alonzo prindivale was a down-state
banker in a town which bore the family
name it was a small town and none
too prosperous but alonzo prindivale
was prosperous amazingly so consider-
ing his limited opportunities by greedy
dollar grabbing and parsimonious nickel
nursing he had become a very rich man
he owned half of prindivale and had a
mortgage on the rest

  three days after the stock-market
crash having raised a small amount of
working capital by various and sundry
means mr clackworthy arrived in
prindivale on the evening train it was
raining and this added to the dismal
outlook from the railroad station plat-
form  a block-long procession of shabby
buildings across the tracks headed by
the only three-story edifice in town the
prindivale house there was no hotel
porter on hand to look after the luggage
of arriving guests mr clackworthy
picked up his bag and started across the
street which was poorly lighted his
foot splashed deep into a puddle of
muddy water the city fathers of the
incorporated town of prindivale were
evidently not spending tax money for
any such modern nonsense as pave-
ments

   ill say grunted the master confi-
dence man that anybody who can
make half a million dollars in a town
like this is good - he smiled grimly
the greedier they are the better i like
to take em

  like its exterior the lobby of the
prindivale house was shabby and un-
pretentious thats what lack of com-
petition does to a business sometimes
a man behind the desk surveyed mr
clackworthy with a listless gaze the
lines about his face bespoke bitterness
and a state of helpless rebellion he
spoke no words of cheering welcome
knowing full well that his guests came
to him because it was the only place to
stop and that they would depart at the
earliest possible moment professional
glad-handing would be just so much
energy wasted

  mr clackworthy signed the register
in his crisp compact businesslike hand-
writing

  a room with a bath he said and
got a quicker answer than he could have
reasonably expected

  cant give you no room with bath

            ds-c
mr clackworthys return



mister got just one and mrs prindi-
vale has got that

  prindivale  murmured mr clack-
worthy do you happen to mean the
wife of mr alonzo prindivale
uh-huh even a grunt may con-
tain a quality of voice which gives an
index to a mans feelings and the mas-
ter confidence man knew instantly that
the proprietor of the prindivale house
disliked the lady in question more im-
portantly however mr clackworthy
was immediately concerned as to the
reason why mrs prindivale was living
at the hotel without her husband or
for that matter why she was living in
the hotel at all this didnt look so
good it offered a discouraging possi-
bility-that alonzo prindivale was no
longer to be listed among the living that
mrs prindivale was a widow

  and mr prindivale

  dead said the hotel proprietor
briefly sourly and thus was mr clack-
worthy informed that he had wasted a
tiresome train journey and twelve dol-
lars in railroad fare-to say nothing of
the unattractive prospect of sleeping in
one of the prindivale house beds which
he was sure would be uncomfortable

  well thats that thought mr
clackworthy with the philosophical
resignation with which he characteristi-
cally met such annoying adversities of
circumstance aloud he said so
alonzo prindivale has passed from your
midst um the community must
find it a distinct loss it will be-ah-
hard to replace such a leading and influ-
ential citizen

  the proprietor of the prindivale
house made a wry grimace perhaps
he was unconscious of it

  not so hard as youd think mister
the only difference is that this here
town of ours is bein bossed by a skirt
stead of a pair of pants i guess if th
truth was known its been bossed by the
same skirt all the time anyhow its
just the same as it was before-only

 ds-c

more so again there was that note
of bitterness but he suddenly stopped
talking as a half-frightened look leaped
into his eyes

  from out of the dining room of the
hotel strode a woman who although he
had never seen her before mr clack-
worthy knew instantly could be none
other than alonzo prindivales widow
she was tall angular and masculine
her stride was that of a man her
face was harsh and forbidding her eyes
were as cold as those of a dead fish and
her dominant jaw jutted out beneath a
thin-slitted tightly clamped mouth

  the proprietor of the prindivale
house smirked and bobbed his head

  i hope you enjoyed your dinner
mrs prindivale

  the soup was cold the beef was
tough and the coffee vile answered
mrs prindivale acridly and with that
she strode her masterful way across the
lobby and vanished through a door
which led -to the stairs

  what a pleasant person she is to
have around murmured mr clack-
worthy

  nothing ever suits her mourned
the hotel proprietor she aint happy
unless shes snapping at somebody if
the soup is served hot she reads a paper
until it gets cold just so shell have
something to kick about i buy a special
brand of coffee sixty cents the pound
and have it made special but she always
complains about the coffee too she
complains that seventy-five dollars a
month is too much for a room with a
bath and three meals a day and then
she complains because i dont meet my
notes at the bank right on the scratch

  in other words sympathetically ob-
served mr clackworthy alonzos
spirit goes marching on

  thunder burst out the hotel pro
prietor unable to resist the temptation
of unburdening himself with a freedom
with which he would not have dared to
do to any one but a stranger alonzos


detective story magazine

spirit my eye everybody in this town
thought it was alonzo but it was her
all the time that made him so mean and
hard with folks oh its easy enough
to see that now he drew a deep
breath leaned confidentially closer be-
traying the fact that his tongue was
being loosened by several drinks of
strong liquor ill lay a little bet
mister that alonzo prindivale is dog-
gone good and glad that hes dead

  mr clack worthy encouraged further
confidences regarding the amazonian
mrs prindivale he gathered that the
womans residence at the hotel was but
temporary her home had burned down
and another was being built she not
only owned the controlling stock of the
prindivale state bank but had elected
herself to the presidency of the institu-
tion she had stepped into her husbands
shoes and they fitted her so perfectly
that every one realized that they must
have been her shoes all the time she
drove the same hard bargains that
alonzo had driven-only harder her
usurious rates of interest disguised as
bonus charges were higher than even
alonzos had been she could foreclose
a mortgage with a ruthlessness that
would have made even alonzo gasp

  all of this information mr clack-
worthv carried with him into the dining
room along with his food which was
really quite excellent over his coffee
the master confidence man came to a
decision which completely overturned his
private code of ethics never in his life
had he cheated a woman he found that
he was able to do it now without a
single twinge of conscience

  it was a sartorially subdued james
early who disembarked at prindivale
from the morning train and surveyed the
local scene with an expression of deepest
disgust upon his thin sharp-featured
face the more he saw of the town
the less he liked it he couldnt recall
that he had ever disliked any place as

he did this one there flashed through
his mind the thought that possibly he
had got off at the wrong station and
heartily wished this were true but the
shabby sign over the shaibby railtoad
station confirmed that this was prindi-
vale across the street was further
proof the prindivale house

  mebbe the wall street clean-out has
made the boss cuckoo muttered the
early bird if theres easy dough in
this burg then theres orange groves in
alaska and there aint never no sunshine
in los angeles for two-bits id grab
the next rattler back to chi never-
theless he picked up his cheap suit case
and made his way toward the hotel

  missing was the early birds snappy
english topcoat absent was the raiment
of dapper elegance which so delighted
his vanity his clothes gave him a bu-
colic air the ridiculous hat a size too
small for his head made him look like
a simple-minded hick precisely the
effect that was desired

  half an hour later james early was
entertaining further misgivings inspired
by his first glimpse of mrs prindivale
the woman president of the prindivale
state bank was sitting at her desk be-
hind a railing having it out with a bor-
rower who couldnt meet his promise to
pay the early bird caught an occa-
sional word of supplication hard luck
all winter two horses died lightning
struck the barn and set fire to it ro-
sies appendix-

  the despairing tragedy of the poor
fellows face alone was enough to melt
a heart of granite but not a muscle of
mrs prindivales harsh face relaxed
and her dead-fish eyes had the chill of
death in them what did she care for
the misfortunes of other people other
than that it usually meant a heavy profit 
another farm to be foreclosed and
bought in for half its value

  the man stopped pleading realizing
how useless it was his hands clenched
curse you then he remembered
mr clackworthys return



that he was talking to a woman he
stumbled to his feet fumbling with his
hat with twitching fingers they were
gnarled hands that had worked hard to
feed his brood of young he was
breathing heavily his mouth sagging
open his staring eyes saw only the
void of black despair

  the early bird witnessed this heart-
rending drama suddenly stirred with
the fervor of a crusader

  believe me old girl he said between
his teeth you got a trimmin cornin to
you and im gonna do my best to see
you get one

  a moment later the early bird was
facing the lady ogre playing the part of
a perfect sap he sat on the extreme
edge of a chair at the end of mrs
prindivales desk looking for all the
world like a flustered yokel overawed by
a greatly superior person

  ysee maam james improvised
haltingly i come into a tidy piece of
money my aunt mathilda she died
and left me some of them liberty
bonds but shucks four per cent aint
nothin to earn on money considerin the
profit whats to be got outta th chicken
business

  so said mrs prindivale the
chicken business how well did she
know the kind of fool who with a lead
pencil and a few sheets of paper got
rich in the chicken business its the
fastest way in the world for a poor man
to get rich-on paper but she did not
tell this simple-looking stranger that he
was a fool she waited to see where it
would lead to

  yesm the early bird went on
eagerly theres a sight of money to
be made outa chickens i got it all fig-
ured out and there aint no way to lose
why maam with eggs sellin up to
seventy and eighty cents a dozen its
a purty onery kind of a hen that wont
make a clean profit of ten dollars a year
now multiply that by a thousand layin v
hens-

  do you want to borrow money
broke in mrs prindivale bluntly

  i got money without havin to bor-
row it maam ysee i was just lookin
fer a mite of advice about buyin a farm
to raise chickens on i thought mebbe
you knowed of some place that could be
got reasonable

  mrs prindivale perceptibly thawed
a smile appeared upon a face that na-
ture had not fashioned for smiling

  oh yes i see mr-mr-

  earlys my name maam

  well mr early the bank is not in
the real-estate business but upstairs is
the realty office of a man i can person-
ally recommend mr kitt undoubtedly
has some bargains in farms and hell
treat you right go up and see mr
kitt you may place full dependence
in any representation that mr kitt
makes to you if you want any more
advice ill be glad to help you

  the early bird got to his feet thank-
ing mrs prindivale profusely hardly
had he got through the railing gate than
the female bank president was reaching
for a private telephone which connected
directly with the real-estate office of mr
kitt upstairs

  listen kitt she said in her hard
metallic voice a man named early is
on the way up wants to buy a farm
and raise chickens looks like a good
chance to unload the tuccio place
what was the figure we bought it for 
fifteen hundred answered kitt
something tells me that this man
early can le induced to pay five thou-
sand

  mr kitt gasped over the wire had
he not been in such mortal fear of mrs
prindivale hed have told her that she
was crazy to expect a price of seventy-
dollars an acre for the rocky worn-out
tuccio farm he himself hadnt as yet
seen what a simple-looking sap he had
to deal with

  ill try promised mr kitt

  start at six commanded mrs

prindivale who believed that a fool and
his money were soon parted-and the
sooner the better

  it would have been a mistake for mr
clackworthy to act too quickly so
anxious as he was to recoup his finances
he quietly remained in chicago and fre-
quently smiled over the mental picture
of the early bird in the role of chicken
farmer surrounded by cackling hens
and crowing roosters and the early
bird going right ahead with the build-
ing of poultry houses just as though he
meant to stay in the chicken business all
his life with equal frequency thought of
mr clackworthy arising each morning
amid the supercomforts of the lake-
shore drive apartment but james re-
sentment was not so great as might be
imagined for he had another picture-
that of mrs prindivale putting the
screws on the poor devil who couldnt
meet his mortgage

  a week and some odd days after the
early bird had purchased the tuccio
farm for three times what it was worth
the master confidence man returned to
prindivale towns of this size are al-
ways curious about strangers especially
those who keep their affairs strictly to
themselves mr clackworthy looked
important even in chicago people would
turn and stare after him as he walked
along the street

  mr clackworthy made himself a man
of mystery each morning after break-
fasting at the prindivale house he
would go down the street to bud sea-
brookes auto livery and have himself
driven out into the country he would
take along an empty canvas bag always
empty when he started and full when
he returned he never explained what
it contained and bud seabrooke extra-
ordinarily adept at prying information
out of people went nearly crazy trying
to figure it out all he knew was that
the mysterious stranger would suddenly
order the car stopped with a curt wait
here and go striding across some farm-

ers field with his empty canvas bag
mr clackworthy might be gone an
hour he might be gone four hours
always when he returned the canvas
bag dragged heavily at his arm

  if he didnt look so sane and sensi-
ble was all bud could offer id say
the guy was a nut

  mayhe its oil suggested elmer
robinson who worked in the prindivale
printing office one guess seemed to be
about as good as another

  every few days the mysterious stran-
ger would ship a box of something to
chicago what the boxes contained no
one knew mail arrived for mr clack-
worthy a letter a day in a long heavily
sealed envelope but the address on the
flap was annoyingly cryptic merely
suite  chemical building chi-
cago

  eventually mrs prindivale herself
began to share in the local curiosity and
one evening at the hotel she engaged
mr clackworthy in conversation she
found him a pleasant gentleman willing
to talk about anything save his own af-
fairs

  while speculation was at a fever heat
mr clackworthy received a telegram
apparently it was urgent for he packed
his bags in haste and departed on the
evening chicago-bound train he didnt
say when he would return if at all and
the town of prindivale decided he never
would for almost a week passed and he
hadnt come back apparently the mys-
tery would remain forever unsolved

  butof course mr clackworthy did
return another trip into the country
this time in the vicinity of the tuccio
farm a neighborhood which he had
already visited more than once and
that evening he called upon mr kitt
the real-estate dealer whom mrs prin-
divale dominated

  mr kitt was a smallish man with a
sharp mind and a weak chin he had
shrewdness but no courage the sort who
can never be anything other than an
mr clackworthys return



understrapper overawed by mr
clackworthys magnificent presence
palpitating with an eager but timid curi-
osity he waited to see what had brought
the impressive and mysterious stranger
to his shabby realty office

  mr kitt the master confidence man
began briskly i want to begin by say-
ing that i know how closely you are
associated with mrs prindivale

  mr kitt raised his hand to his throat
and toyed with his protuberant adams
apple

 why i-er-that is- direct-
ness of speech was not his way

  i am fully aware went on mr
clackworthy just what that association
is and youre mighty poorly paid for
what you do i am here to offer you a
chance to make a thousand dollars as
my agent did you ever get a thousand
dollars in any deal in which you repre-
sented mrs prindivale the answer
mr kitt is no

  mr kitt licked his lips avidly

  i want to buy a piece of property
that belongs to mrs prindivale pur-
sued the master confidence man its
an eighty acre farm legally de-
scribed as the southwest half of the
northeast quarter of section  range
 east i want to buy it without mrs
prindivale knowing im buying it

  mr kitt took down the county atlas
and turned the pages to range  east
his eyes sought the description mr
clackworthy had given him his mouth
sagged open

  why that he gasped thats the

farm- but the next instant his

teeth had clicked together like the snap
of a steel trap and the master confidence
man pretended not to notice

  mrs prindivales money bought it
in at a foreclosure sale three years ago
for fifteen hundred dollars the title
stands in the name of oscar biddle who
i know as well as you do is only a
dummy for mrs prindivales transac-
tions

  mr kitt thought it wise to withhold
the information that the tuccio farm
had passed from mrs prindivales con-
trol he meant to find out if possible
what the prosperous-looking stranger
wanted with a worn-out farm why
had the local man of mystery picked out
the tuccio farm after weeks of roam-
ing through the country there must
be money in it-big money perhaps for
mr clackworthy one instinctively felt
wouldnt be interested in any other kind
of money

  you wasnt mebbe thinkin of farm-
in the tuccio place said mr kitt

i wouldnt hardly have took you for a
-er-an agriculturist

  never mind about that retorted the
master confidence man i want to buy
that eighty acres its salable value is
something like twenty-five hundred
mrs prindivale ought to be satisfied
with that but probably wont be im
willing to give five thousand you get
it at five thousand for me and the dif-
ference is yours

  mr kitt had difficulty in controlling
the muscles of his face true a simple-
minded sap by the name of early had -
paid fifty-five hundred for the tuccio
place but mr clackworthy was not by
any possible stretch of the imagination
simple-minded if this canny man of
the world was willing to pay five thou-
sand it was worth more-undoubtedly
a good deal more why why that
question shouted through mr kitts
rather bewildered mind and without
any answer

  i reckon sir he said when he could
trust himself to speak calmly you got
land values held too cheap mrs prin-
divale-that is mr biddle-has refused
six thousand for that farm

  mr clackworthys eyes narrowed ac-
cusingly are you trying to kid me
mr kitt mrs prindivale refused six
thousand dollars for it dont make me
laugh

  fact declared the real-estate dealer


detective story magazine

land values seem to be kind of boomin
around here lately

  then im not interested the master
confidence man said curtly and moved
toward the door when mr kitt did
not call him back he paused retracing
his steps he looked angry

  same old game they always play in
these hick towns let a stranger want
to buy something and up goes the price
but i guess i can do business cheaper
through you at that get the tuccio
farm for me at six thousand and theres
a thousand dollars in it for you

  mr kitt drummed the tips of his fin-
gers together here was a situation
which required the use of his wits he
had to have time to think

  ill see what i can do he said ill
let you know about it some time to-
morrow

  when mr clackworthy had departed
mr kitt leaped to his feet and began
pacing the floor here he felt was his
chance to make a killing but there were
obstacles to begin with the tuccio
farm had passed out of mrs prindi-
vales hands james early had paid
fifty-five hundred dollars for the eighty
acres he had spent some money on
poultry houses and chickens there-
fore it wasnt likely that early would
sell for six and there was mrs prin-
divale to be considered her wrath
would be a terrible thing if she discov-
ered that he mr kitt had been trying
to make some money on his own hook
even at the thought of it he had a faint
feeling

  its no use the real-estate dealer
muttered there aint nothin i can
do on my own i gotta turn this propo-
sition over to mrs prindivale

  a few minutes later mr kitt was
downstairs in the bank conferring with
mrs prindivale

  nearest i can figger out he was
saying this here early yap aint had
his deed recorded yet thats why mr
clackworthy thinks titles still in oscar

biddles name and he knows that oscar
biddle is really you hes crazy to get
hold of that no-good farm and im half
crazy myself tryin to figger out why
what could he want it for

  shut up rasped mrs prindivale
im trying to think

 peremptorily summoned to mrs
prindivales room luther witherspoon
the proprietor of the prindivale house
wondered uneasily what it would be this
time without much doubt it was go-
ing to be unpleasant whatever it was
he rapped respectfully at the door of
his star guest

  come in mrs prindivales voice
sounded even more forbidding than
usual she fixed mr witherspoon with
her dead-fish eyes and poor luther
shuffled his feet uncomfortably for a
moment there was silence

  luther

  yes mrs prindivale

  youve got a seven-hundred dollar
note due at the bank next monday morn-
ing can you pay it

  a sickly pallor began spreading over
the hotel proprietors face

  why-why i guess you know i cant
meet that note he stammered you
-youve been lettin me pay a little
something on it when i could

  having made it clear to luther with-
erspoon that she could put him out of
business any time she chose and hinting
that such an eventuality was by no
means impossible mrs prindivale
abruptly switched to another subject
there was no apparent relevancy be-
tween the two but of course luther
would not miss the point

  luther

  yes mrs prindivale

  this man clackworthy-what do you
know about him

  no more than anybody else maam
and which is next to nothing

  id like to know what that man is
up to luther
mr clackworthys return



  so would everybody else in this
town maam

  im suspicious of the man luther
honest men dont hide their business
like he does who is he what is he
the proprietor of the prindivale
house could only reply with a baffled
gesture

  he may be a crook luther maybe
hes planning to rob the bank i think
we should know something about him
again she impaled luther with her icy
gaze there is one way we can its
our duty to do it luther

  do what maam

  this mr clackworthy is downstairs
having his dinner youve got a pass-
key to his room i want you to get me
whatever papers hes got and bring them
here to me-at once dont stand there
gaping at me like that you dolt were
not going to steal anything

  bjbut stammered luther wither-
spoon s-suppose he walked in and
caught me goin through his things
why-why he could have me arrested

he might-

  what im particularly interested in
seeing broke in mrs prindivale is
the contents of those important-looking
envelopes that have been coming to him
in the mail from chicago her heavy
bulging chin thrust itself forward are
you going to refuse this simple request
luther she demanded ominously

  luther witherspoon gulped he was
on the brink of dilemma if he refused
to rifle mr clackworthys luggage she
would refuse to give him another exten-
sion on his note it meant he would
lose the hotel

  ill do it he capitulated with a
grimace of distaste wondering what
mrs prindivales real motive was the
elegant solid substantial mr clack-
worthy a bank robber she didnt
think that any more than she thought
five per cent a satisfactory rate of inter-
est

  it wasnt after all so difficult as

luther witherspoon had anticipated
mr clackworthy hadnt taken the pre-
caution of locking his bags resting
conveniently within the top of the suit
case was a portfolio neatly arranged
with important-looking papers

  a few minutes later mrs prindi-
vale was discovering why mr clack-
worthy was trying to buy the practically
worthless tuccio farm this informa-
tion contained in a letter on the letter-
head of the international chemical co
made mrs prindivale gasp for breath
and sent her pulse up to one hundred
and twenty anybody with a fair knowl-
edge of things knew that the interna-
tional chemical co was a fifty-million-
dollar concern and what the excited
lady didnt know or rather what she
didnt suspect was that anybody with
a printing press could print any kind
of a letterhead he chose

  one paragraph in that letter contained
the gist of the whole mysterious busi-
ness 

  radium is where you find it none of us
can quite recover from our surprise to find
it so close and in such unprecedented quan-
tities but the laboratory reports speak for
themselves the rock samples labeled no
-b make it clear that you have discovered
the richest radium deposit in the history of
the chemical industry i am recommending
to the board of directors that they vote you
a bonus of one hundred thousand dollars

  fantastic we are living in a fan-
tastic agean era of almost incredulous
miracles a man with a bicycle shop
becomes the richest man in the world
three brothers capture the motion-pic-
ture business of the world with a pho-
nograph disk and a radio loud-speaker
science is the magician which makes im-
possible things come true radium in
the rocks of a worthless hillside farm
not so fantastic perhaps after all con-
sidering all of the other amazing things
that are happening

  mrs prindivales hands were trem-
bling as she gave the filched portfolio


detective story magazine

back to luther witherspoon she was
hardly aware that she did

  radium she whispered radium
and i sold the tuccio farm for fifty-
five hundred dollars a hundred thou-
sand dollars-just as a bonus that
meant millions-millions she tried to
remember what radium sold for an
ounce as near as she could recall it
was something like fifty thousand dol-
lars

  in a trance the woman got to her
feet there was no time to be lost any
moment mr clackworthy might dis-
cover that she no longer owned the tuc-
cio farm and then it would be too late
she had to buy the tuccio place back
no matter if she did have to give the
poor fool who thought there was a for-
tune in raising chickens a profit of two
or three thousand she had to buy it
back

  having returned to chicago some
hours ahead of the early bird mr
amos clackworthy was mixing himself
a high ball when he heard the door of
his lakeshore drive apartment open
the early bird stood in the doorway
flapping his arms and crowing like a
rooster he danced a jig dug his hands
into his pockets and with a grand ges-
ture flung a fat packet of yellow bills
on the table then another and then a
third

  theres the stuff boss thirty
grand-thirty thousand smackers who
says there aint no money in the chicken
business i wasnt called the early
bird for nothin huh never has it
been such a pleasure to take money from
anybody oh boy wouldnt i give
somethin to see that female shylocks
face when she gets tired of waitin for
you to come back and buy the tuccio
farm for two or three million and phones
the international chemical co and is
told they hadnt never heard of mr
clackworthy and that theres about as
much radium in her rocks as there is

in an old shoe oh aint she gonna be
one mad lady when she finds out we put
the bee on her yeah and how i
gotta hunch boss we better slide outa
th country for a while

  the master confidence man shook his
head

  you mean that mrs prindivale may
have us prosecuted no my dear
james i anticipate nothing like that
not even for thirty thousand dollars
would she let that hick town know that
shes been a sucker but tell me james
wasnt she rather bowled over when you
screwed up the figure to thirty thou-
sand i didnt really expect you to get
more than half of that thinking you
such a boob i wonder that didnt make
her suspicious

  aw that was dead easy boss i
kind of give her the idea that mr kitt
had wised me up a little

  ah murmured mr clackworthy
thats genius james

  sure boss i let her think that kitt
was tryin to double cross her and
then i let her think she was real good
by gettin mne down to thirty-five thou-
sand

  thirty-five is it now james i
thought you said thirty

  i left five grand back there in prin-
divale boss ysee there was a guy
that mrs prindivale had put th screws
on hed had a lot of bad luck-two
of his horses died and his barn got
struck by lightnin and burned down
and he had a couple of sick kids she
was foreclosin on him yunderstand
and i kind of got soft about the poor
guy anyhow boss i slipped him three
grand he owed missus prindivale and
got his kid sent to a hospital and did a
few other little things for im you
aint sore are you boss

mr clackworthy laughed merrily
so long as you did this act of charity
with mrs prindivales money im not
one thing ive always liked about you
james is that youre so human

a short vacation

nce years ago doctor aloy-
sius moran and i went hunt-
ing together in the carolinas

we both enjoyed that trip
for we found that our ideas of sport
coincided beautifully to go hunting
meant for the chief medical examiner
of new york city-as for my humble
self-to go away out into the country
to wear rough clothes all day to forget
dignity and work and spend the time
eating sleeping and talking and occa-
sionally perhaps to wander oft into the
woods shotgun in hand and loaf
gorgeously under the trees squirrels
would scold at us rabbits would hop
about fearlessly the bobwhite quail
would whistle in our ears but the

 wild life of the carolinas was safe from
 us two we preferred to sit smoke and
 talk largely about a dream world in
 which all patients should be rich and
 grateful and all murderers crafty and
 vicious in which i might work miracu-
 lous cures and doctor aloysius moran
 might endlessly solve intricate criminal
 mysteries never failing and never
 forced to waste his powers upon mere
 obvious gunmens battles

   we had found that trip delightful
 and ever since we had at odd moments
 planned another like it but something
 always intervened when i found my-
 self comparatively free doctor moran
 would be submerged in some-to him-
 delightful murder for he was a con-
 scientious medical examiner who re-
 fused to content himself with a mere
 autopsy and a formal report of the


detective story magazine

causes of death but spent his energies
lavishly in search for the real criminal
-usually to the satisfaction if occa-
sionally to the chagrin of the police de-
partment heads and when the city
was law-abiding and its citizens re-
frained from abolishing each other so
that the doctor became restless and
irritable and complained of the dull-
ness of his job even to the oft-threat-
ened verge of inciting some likely per-
son to murder it would happen that i
had a patient or several patients in
critical condition whom i could not
leave for like every other virtuous
practitioner i was convinced that my
patients had employed the best possible
doctor for what ailed them and if i
intrusted their care to another no mat-
ter how competent they might well suf-
fer for it

  and so in spite of many false starts
and much desultory planning doctor
moran and i-doctor john pelton at
your service-never did get away to-
gether until last october

  on the fifteenth of that month just
at the end of my morning office hour as
i bowed out the last patient i heard a
tremendous chattering roar from up
the street it grew swiftly louder be-
came deafening and a huge red auto-
mobile swept around the corner on two
wheels implacable as the car of jagan-
nath it slowed down with a horrid
screeching of brakes and came to a
bucking skidding halt in front of my
house from it emerged a huge head
topped by a high flat-crowned derby
hat then a great square red face then
a pair of thick shoulders doctor aloy-
sius moran had come calling in his
usual impetuous fashion

  he bounced out of the big red car-a
man of sixty-odd somewhat under mid-
dle height but with a body as long and
wide and thick as a barrel his shoul-
ders were abnormally wide and per-
fectly square and his huge head was set
upon them without the interposition of

any visible neck so that it looked rather
like a pumpkin set on top of a big dry-
goods box his arms were very long
and thick like a gorillas and his legs
were short and thick also and much
bowed out at the knees he wore a
suit of shepherds plaid that fairly
screamed it was so loud and seemed
absurdly out of place with his minis-
terial-looking hat

  such was doctor aloysius moran
chief medical examiner-a striking fig-
ure almost grotesque but redeemed
from absurdity by a certain forceful-
ness hard to describe he was ridicu-
lous at first glance as he rushed up
the steps of my house swaying on his
short thick bandy legs but one look
into his tawny-yellow eyes would have
told the most unobserving person that
here was a man of importance

  hi johnny pelton greeted the
doctor in a deep bass shout come on
inside want to talk to you

  he removed his flat-topped derby
hat and wiped a forehead very high
and wide and bumpy and swept back
the mane of tawny hair that fell across
it his eyebrows were a continuous
inch-wide band of fulvous yellow
sweeping across his face from temple to
temple beneath it yellow eyes like a
lions snapped and sparkled he was
clean shaven his nose was short and
snubbed his mouth very wide his chin
as wide and as long as his forehead and
he was obviously in a state of vast ex-
citement-not unusual with doctor
moran

  come inside man he repeated his
voice rumbling deep in his throat
come on in got something to tell
you

  i did not move quickly enough to suit
him and his great square face turned
purple his yellow eyes blazed up
came a thick stumpy forefinger he
shook it beneath my nose confound
it come in he rumbled

  abruptly his sub-bass tones broke
satans wood



and leaped two octaves to a shrill fal-
setto squawk confound curse blast
and darn it all johnny pelton he
cried move cant you get inside

i say

  the angry color faded the doctors
wide face broke into the most amiable
of smiles he took his finger from be-
neath my nose examined it curiously
and thrust his hand into his pocket
lets go into your office dear friend
he invited his voice back to its normal
sub-cellar bass theres no use get-
ting all excited and upset and telling
the neighbors your business but you
always were an incontinent man
grinning widely at his own inconsis-
tency perhaps doctor aloysius moran
waddled past me on his short thick legs
and went into my office i followed to
find him settled in my most comfortable
chair fumbling at a pocket

  look here johnny pelton he rum-
bled let me show you now where
in blazes did i put that thing here it
is what do you think of that young-
fellow-my-lad eh 

  he produced a small neatly printed
pamphlet and slapped it down on my
desk i glanced at it hotel aradia
in the heart of the catskills

   why said i ive got one of those
myself it came in the mornings mail
yes and i got another several months
ago back in the spring it was

  doctor moran snorted so did i
what of it what of it i say blast
and incinerate it all this is now not
last spring listen

  he tapped the desk top with a thick
blunt finger his great red face wreathed
in smiles he was as blissfully excited
as a small boy planning to go fishing

  listen johnny pelton im tired
im bored things are dull-beastly
dull not a respectable murder in
months everybody honest and loving
his neighbor instead of his neighbors
wife its no city for an industrious
necrologist johnny in short im sick

  of doing nothing here in the medical
examiners office so let us go away
somewhere into the woods and do noth-
ing there how about it  lets take a
vacation johnny pelton what say
eh

  i deliberated why weve talked it
over so often and somethings always
turned up to prevent but things are
pretty slow with me too just now
yes i believe i can make it

  doctor moran jumped up lets
go he mumbled his wide mouth all
agrin come along and he started
toward the door as though about to start
his trip this instant

  hold on i called after him
there are a few little things to de-
cide first such as finding a substitute to
take care of what little practice ive got
left and borrowing some money from
the bank for expenses and all this and
that and another thing too where
shall we go

  he stared at me in apparent surprise
his tawny eyes sparkling where
where he cried what have i been
talking about all this while why to
this aradia place naturally havent
you read the prospectus darn it
good plain food quiet homelike sur-
roundings  hunting and fishing close
by what more would you ask eh

  i glanced the pamphlet over it
reads well i conceded but what do
we know about this place anyhow 

  what do we need to know what
more i mean why ive been getting
an announcement from this place twice a
year for two years now spring and fall
that shows its an established hotel
doesnt it  been running two years at
least besides argued doctor moran
pugnaciously what do we need to be
so gosh-darned careful for anyhow
arent wre old enough and tough
enough and ugly enough to take care
of ourselves it isnt as though alice
macy were loose he finished with a
sudden change of tone


detective story magazine

  i shivered involuntarily that name
was enough at any time to send a thrill
f fear up my spine for alice macy
-or alicia tavannes as she had called
herself when we first knew her-had
sworn a dreadful vengeance upon doc-
tor moran and upon me and she was
quite capable of carrying out the most
horrid threats since to our knowledge
she had poisoned a small boy and all
but murdered a woman in a peculiarly
horrible fashion by applying leeches to
her veins while she lay unconscious

  no i agreed slowly shes not
loose thank heaven

  the medical examiner grinned cheer-
fully and rubbed thick hands together
shell never trouble us again

  dont be too sure i warned him
prisoners hav escaped before now
and that woman is as clever as a fiend-
if she isnt one in fact

  theres a prison from which nobody
escapes though and the fair alice has
been committed to it

  i stared at him you mean-

  exactly i mean shes dead and
thank goodness for it i got to won-
dering about her not long ago and i
wrote the womens prison to inquire
they told me she died there quite sud-
denly about two years ago

  i pondered that a moment im
mighty glad of it i decided if its
true

  true true doctor aloysius
moran glared at me his great square
face purpling his voice leaped two
octaves to an enraged squeal true
of course its true blast it think
theyd lie to me

  he shook a thick forefinger beneath
my nose then suddenly withdrew it and
looked it all over as though he thought

i	might have bitten it off you
oughtnt to be so skeptical johnny pel-
ton he mumbled very mildly be-
cause it makes me nervous because i
felt just about like that myself

  the doctor paused his tawny eyes

   absent a curious expression on his face
his fulvous eyebrows twitched

  im not superstitious in a general
way he-went on reflectively but
there was something not quite human
about that creature she was really
beautiful you remember perfect fea-
tures and a voice like-like the ringing
of thin glass and those green eyes of
hers deep as the sea but johnny my
lad did you ever see her without
shrinking didnt she make you shud-
der inside wasnt she like a beautiful
poisonous snake

  worse than that

  worse indeed as i say im not
ordinarily superstitious but if there
are witches johnny she was a witch
and to that i agreed or a vam-
pire i added shuddering again at the
memory of alice macy her white teeth
gleaming from between parted scarlet
lips as she stooped over the exsan-
guinated form of poor mrs burbage

  well witch or vampire she was a
demon-if there are demons and im
glad shes dead johnny pelton i sleep
better of nights for knowing it

  what moved me to it i cannot guess
even to this day but my lips parted
then and i spoke it was as though
another voice used my tongue for its
own purposes

  evil never dies i said and sat
still staring at my guest in dumb be-
wilderment

  doctor moran stared back a strange
expression on his face and made an
abortive gesture as though he would
have crossed himself then he shook
his great thick shoulders and burst into
a rumbling laugh

  were two old women johnny pel-
ton  he declared thumping my shoul-
der toothless doddering grand-
mothers shame on us both now
lets plan this hunting trip and have no
more foolishness

  right you are how do we get to
this place anyhow
satans wood



  the doctor thumbed that pamphlet
pollakville station he read on the
b  a it says then you drive ten
miles or so over improved roads mo-
tor bus meets trains by appointment
one place is as good as another i
told him as long as its not too far
away and as long as its quiet whats
the proprietors name

  manew mrs sarah manew har-
rumph  doctor moran cleared his
throat thunderously as was his star-
tling habit so that i jumped peculiar
name that manew pollakville
sounds balkan doesnt it probably
manieu to begin with well johnny
pelton when shall i write mrs manew
to expect us

  i thought a moment i can get
h p d ames to look after my work
why i could start day after to-mor-
row

  good enough ill write to-night
no ill telegraph want to be sure and
get rooms

  doctor moran half rose then sank
back into his chair staring oddly at that
neatly printed pamphlet aradia he
repeated hotel aradia yes and
the seasons too may and october
theres something queer about that
johnny pelton

  whats so queer i suppose its on
account of the game laws or something
like that but lots of such places have
two seasons a year

  ye-es of course but may and
october and at the aradia

  why not

  the medical examiner eyed me as-
kance didnt you ever hear of
aradia

  we-ell i think- it sounds fa-
miliar somehow but i cant remem-
ber anything about it might be the
name of a pullman car

  it is the name said doctor moran
half seriously of the patron goddess
of all witches and sorcerers aradia
was the daughter of diana and lucifer

born in the dark of the moon and her
sign and symbol was the cat hence all
witches keep black cats

  he looked at me rather defiantly and
went on and the night of april th
is walpurgis-nacht-walpurgas eve
the spring festival of pan the night
when all evil spirits are loosened
while as for halloween the last night
in october i suppose even you johnny
pelton he finished rudely i suppose
even you must have heard tales about
halloween 

  i stared at the doctor curiously won-
dering as i had wondered before on
more than one occasion how much the
man really believed of all that mass of
superstitious lore he knew so well for
doctor aloysius moran was a veritable
mine of quaint and curious information
about ghosts and vampires and witches
and sorcerers and necromancers and
succubi and incubi and i know not what
of supernatural matters

  you dont believe that rot surely
doctor moran forced a grin or i
fancied that his smile was constrained
certainly not har-rumph but just
the same im glad alice macy is dead
if she were alive id hesitate to visit
any place called aradia and especially
at halloween time

chapter ii

witch hollow

e

it developed that mrs sarah manew
would be delighted to reserve two
rooms for doctor moran and me and
so we completed our preparations and
finally set out for pollakville on the
morning of october th as delighted
as two schoolboys on the first day of
their long vacation

  the train trip was long and tedious
we had to change three times waiting
an hour or more each time and chang-
ing from a dingy cindery local to one
still more dingy and forlorn so that
doctor moran mourned and bewailed


detective story magazine

his foolishness in taking a train instead
of motoring comfortably through the
country throughout his complaints
he eyed me with bitter meaning but i
hardened my heart doubtless this trip
was dirty smoky and fatiguing yet to
have trusted myself to doctor aloysius
morans driving through a hundred-
and-fifty-mile motor trip would have
been suicidal and so i told him

  grumble all you please i said se-
renely its dirty yes and sooty my
hair is full of cinders and theres a big
one in my eye and this day coach
hasnt been cleaned since stephensons
day all very true but my dear
good reckless friend in this way we
shall arrive at our destination dirty and
uncomfortable no doubt but all in one
piece while with your driving-i say
 more doctor moran except that i
want to go to pollakville not to my last
long home

  the medical examiner grinned re-
luctantly i suppose youd like to have
a boy on horseback riding in front of
every automobile waving a red flag
he gibed but i was not crushed

  it is a pity there cant be some
means of warning traffic off the roads
before you come along why the car
of juggernaut would be nothing to that
red car of yours not even if it had six-
teen cylinders

  har-umph said doctor moran
this must be pollakville now high
time too we might have been here
five hours ago

  the rickety engine squealed asthmati-
cally  our battered day coach bumped to
a halt and we disembarked as the brake-
man announced pollakville my
companion glanced disparagingly about
the mean dilapidated village

  if this is city what must the suburbs
be

  a flannel-shirted youth was ap-
proaching his tanned face was quite
expressionless he chewed gum vigor-
ously

  this them two doctors fr mrs
manews place  he inquired-of empty
space apparently for he looked at
neither of us

  these is them replied doctor mo-
ran promptly can you take us
there 

  uh-huh baggage

  the youth chewed his gum harder
than ever and his pale eyes wandered
about looking for our bags he seemed
a taciturn person

  we collected our impedimenta a suit
case and hand bag each and a leather
gun case or two and a jointed fish rod
each though neither of us had much
idea of hunting or fishing it would have
looked odd we had decided to come
without any sporting implements at all

  the young man took a suit case in
each hand leaving the other things for
us to bring bus around behind the
depot he vouchsafed and stalked
away

  we followed meekly to find an
ancient flivver standing at the edge of
a wide dirt road it was an open car
and topless and its fenders were sadly
crumpled and tied on with wires one
door was missing entirely and the
others swung loose but as our guide
cranked its motor after heaping our
baggage into the tonneau it gave forth
a satisfying regular humming roar
obviously for all its dilapidated ap-
pearance the thing would still run

  doctor moran and i scrambled in
and settled ourselves as best we could
among gun cases and bags and the
youtft drove off without a word we
went down the one wide street of pol-
lakville wrhere a loafer or two sat
somnolently on benches in front of
mean little shops and then struck into
a well-paved state road our driver
glanced to his right at the low-hanging
sun and opened his throttle wide so
that we sped along the pavement at the
flivvers very best pace

  the country wras rough and hilly on
satans wood



either side steep slopes climbed to
sharp summits and beyond them we
could see crest after crest higher and
higher as the foothills gave place to
veritable mountains we drove along
a narrow winding gut evidently a pass
through the mountain range and our
general direction was southeast

  our chauffeur spoke no word but he
kept pushing the flivver until its radia-
tor puffed steam it panted and la-
bored up long grades shot down steep
hills like a frightened rabbit took sharp
curves on two wheels so that i was al-
most thrown out and began to wonder
if i might not have been safer even
with doctor morans driving and all
the while the driver kept his eyes front
save for an occasional worried glance
at the setting sun and vouchsafed us no
attention whatever

  at last i leaned forward to address
him thinking that he might be shy of us
as city folks i fairly had to shout the
rickety old car made such a noise

  what kind of a town is this pollak-
ville i asked idly with nothing in
mind save to start a conversation

  the youth shrugged bum he
grunted never looking around

  i tried again funny name isnt
it

  nope settled by poliaks and hun-
kies ats all

  we labored up a long long slope in
places so steep that we had to go into
low gear and travel no faster than a
man could walk at last we reached
its crest and the driver paused to cool
his boiling radiator

  far off to our right the red sun hung
low above tall mountains the sky was
deeply blue and very clear at the zen-
ith  but around the horizon hung a
vague faint shimmering mist-a haze
rather such as one sees in indian sum-
mer i breathed deeply the keen
sweet air held a faint and far-off tang
of wood smoke

  it was a pleasant prospect that lay

outspread before my eyes here na-
ture remained virgin as far as one
could see there was no sign of hu-
man habitation and not even a road
save the one we traveled hill was
heaped up behind towering hill and all
the slopes were thickly wooded and
trees and dense underbrush grew right
up to the edge of the concrete here
if anywhere we could find peace and
solitude i thought it was very rest-
ful

  before us the country fell away in
long rolling sweeps for uncounted
miles until one coud see the distant
plain beyond the mountains on either
side the rolling hills marched off sepa-
rating gradually to leave a wedge-
shaped valley which notched deep into
the mountain range so that its head was
but a few miles before us this valley
was bare of trees for the most part
though little woodlands stood here and
there but one could make out no signs
of cultivation that faint thin haze
hung over what seemed a natural
meadow

  beside me doctor moran stirred
wild country isnt it he murmured
with a satisfied smile not a sign of
life good how far is it to the ara-
dia hotel son

  our driver started and glanced again
at the sun far enough he grumbled
too far must be six or seven miles
it ought to be in sight then i pro-
tested and searched the empty plain
which lay at our feet

  cant see nothing trees hide it
its in about there the young man
pointed briefly and started up his mo-
tor and began to plunge recklessly
down the long slope

 many people live down there
doctor moran inquired

uh-huh some must be couple
hundred folks in the hollow all told
are they poles too  mrs manews
name sounds as if it might have been
hungarian once or roumanian


detective story magazine

 the youth nodded yeah her
folks come fom the old country lotta
hunkies and all like that

  whats your name i asked cas-
ually

  lesky con lesky

  leslie

 nope lesky conrad lesky
he was entirely serious he saw no in-
consistency in his contempt for hun-
kies and all like that

  all the while young lesky was driv-
ing faster and faster until we shot
down the long hill at a dangerous speed
i protested mildly

  were in no such hurry as that
take your time

  but he only glanced over a shoulder
at the sun which almost touched the
tallest mountaintop and urged the fliv-
ver on gotta get back he mumbled
uneasily its most sunset now
doctor moran leaned forward are
the people out this way very supersti-
tious do they believe in witches and
so on

  yeah sure reglar hill-billies
ignorant as anything superstitious as
all get-out he drove faster yet
backwoods bohunks he sneered

  i was holding on with both hands
praying that we might reach the aradia
alwe but doctor moran enjoyed his
ride our reckless speed exhilarated
him he laughed aloud

  this is traveling he exulted
speed her up son

  we fairly dropped down a last long
grade and with a sigh of relief i real-
ized that we had reached the bottom of
that frightening slope now the road
wound and twisted through waste lands
from which the timber had long since
been stripped so that it was grown up
to ragged thickets of second growth
hills cut off our view and the road
twisted among them evidently the
valley which had seemed so level from
that mountaintop was cut up actually
into ravines and guts between steep

jagged rocky knolls now we climbed
one of these and i could see for a cou-
ple of miles perhaps

  almost directly in front of us was a
rather extensive woodland which must
have covered many acres it was a de-
light to the eye tired of viewing waste
brambly slashings dotted with stumps

  theres a regular forest moran i
pointed out that must be near the
hotel unless the announcement lied
theres no other woods in sight and the
notice claimed extensive forests 
how about that son inquired
doctor moran

  lesky nodded yeah its a-dog
woods a right

  what did you call it i demanded
struck by the odd name  a dogs
woods

  beside me the medical examiner
grunted significantly ordogs wood
he corrected isnt that it con  or-
dogs wood-satans wood-the hex-
enwald

  lesky looked over his shoulder turn-
ing right around so that i made sure
we would be wrecked his face was
troubled uneasy suspicious

  whaddayuh mean he asked i
saw him thrust out his left hand fur-
tively  its two middle fingers were
folded in its forefinger and little finger
thrust stiffly out in that ancient sign of
the homed hand of ashtoreth-what
the italians call the jettatura as
every one knows that symbol wards off
all witchcraft and especially the evil
eye it seemed that con lesky too
for all his contempt of such things ac-
knowledged a grain of superstition

 whaddayuh mean hexenwald 
some of the old folks does call it that
sometimes he mumbled his breath
in a foreign language i thought i
heard a word stregoica

  doctor moran nudged me means
a witch he whispered and aloud
whats the name of this settlement
were coming to

            ds-c
satans wood

 -

  witch hollow grunted young
lesky without turning and he drove
faster than ever glancing at the sun
most there now he sighed deeply
as with relief

  we had reached a crossroads there
was no house in sight nor any sign of
life no evidence that human beings had
penetrated thus far before us save the
road we traversed-its pavement gone
now to be replaced by uneven gravelly
dirt-and that other road which was
scarcely more than a track which
crossed it at right angles beyond the
crossroads lay the tall thick-standing
trees of ordogs wood con lesky
hunched his bullet head between his
shoulders as though against a driving
storm and forced the flivver to its ut-
most

  we entered the gloomy aisles of the
forest and lost sight of the sun here
it was dusk as it must have been even
at midday for the wood was very dense
tall evergreen trees crowded right to
the edge of the road our driver looked
neither to the right nor the left he was
rigid and tense and obviously afraid i
wondered why

  presently-scarcely more than a hun-
dred and fifty yards beyond the cross-
roads i noticed an opening in the for-
est at our right the great trees were
more widely spaced and there was less
undergrowth that was all the forest
remained unbroken but one could see
uncertainty between thick trunks for
several rods into the woodland

  looking that way i seemed to see a
gray-stone wall and so rubbed my eyes
and looked again yes there was a
building there in the heart of that deep
forest i shivered involuntarily it
seemed a strange place to build for
there was something strange uncanny
not quite wholesome about that ordogs
wood so that i could not wonder at its
name surely satan and no more
amiable spirit dwelt here

  i was the more surprised then to

 ds-c

see by straining my eyes that it was a
chapel which stood there in satans
wood yes it was tumble-down and
half ruined its gray stone walls
breached and half its spire fallen but
it was a veritable church none the less

  a breath a flash and we had
passed and were rocketing onward
through dense forest the ruined
chapel had vanished as though by
magic and i half doubted having seen
it at all i turned to doctor moran

  he nodded an old church i saw
it too with a graveyard beside it
odd place for a church

  our driver heard shuddered and
crossed himself then suddenly he
screamed and jerked at the steering
wheel until we lurched and skidded half
across the road the flivver slid into
the left-hand ditch and nearly upset
con lesky stared with bulging eyes at
something in the thick woods on our
right-something white which seemed
to flutter and move as i watched it

  the boy was livid with horror his
teeth chattered he muttered thickly
and i caught one word vrolek
vrolek repeated over and over

  with prompt presence of mind doc-
tor moran half rose and leaning far
over reached a thick arm past our
trembling driver to catch the steering
wheel exerting his great strength
the medical examiner straightened the
flivver out so that we scrambled back
into the road

  har-rumph said he newspaper
nothing but a piece of paper drive
on my bold lad

 con lesky flushed darkly he
seemed ashamed of his outbreak and
gripped the wheel again and drove on
none the less he glanced apprehen-
sively over his right shoulder at inter-
vals

  them woods is-is queer he mut-
tered defensively fellers got a right
to be scairt things thats happened
there


detective story magazine

  he would say nothing more though
i plied him with questions the wood
was queer things had happened
there and furthermore he must get
us to mrs manews place just as
quickly as he could because he wasnt
going to drive through ordogs wood
after sunset and he drove as fast as
if the erl-king himself rode after us

  i was vastly intrigued and i must
admit the least trifle uncomfortable
but doctor moran beside me only
grinned a placidly superior grin and
said nothing save that he whispered
once to me too low for our driver to
hear

  vrolek he said means a vam-
pire

  that called up a most unpleasant
memory once more i seemed to see
alice macy or alicia tavannes green
eyes blazing red lips parted as she
suddenly leaned over the ghastly blood-
less figure of mrs burbage on whose
bare throat was a tiny pale-lipped
wound

  i leaned forward nervously and i
was almost as glad as con lesky i
think when we made a sharp turn to the
right and a rambling white house came
into view con pointed toward it

  mrs manews place he vouch-
safed

  it was not a large building it
seemed scarcely more than a cottage it
stood well back from the road beneath
tall funereal evergreen trees fir and
hemlock that loomed blue-black in the
fading light its paint originally white
but fade to a ghostly gray gleamed
faintly from the shadows all about so
that i thought of an ancient tombstone
altogether it was an uninviting place
to reach after our drive through satans
wood

  no light shone from its small many-
paned windows no smoke rose from
its low rough-stone chimney it
seemed deserted lurking beneath those
tall sad trees like some furtive ghost

hiding from human eyes as i stared
at the old house a huge black cat ap-
peared from nowhere and sat itself
down upon the stone doorstep and
watched us with yellow shining eyes

  this cant be a hotel i protested
but as the flivver squealed to a stop i
saw a signboard freshly painted that
hung from a tree by the road and its
legend ran thus hotel aradia

  its mrs manews a right con
lesky repeated and without more
words he leaped from his seat and be-
gan with frenzied haste to fling our
baggage out upon the ground

  almost before doctor moran and i
could alight he was back in his place
and racing the flivvers motor dont
you want your pay i suddenly
shouted above its roar but he only
shook his head

  be on th bill he screamed and
backed his car and wrenched it about
in the road and was off at top speed
driving as though satan pursued

 thick dust mingled with black smoke
from the exhaust blew into our faces
and before we could protest con lesky
had vanished around the nearest curve
leaning forward over his wheel like a
jockey in the stretch

i looked at doctor moran and
laughed uneasily well here we are
har-rumph quite here we are
as you so clearly state it and i for
one am glad of it lets go eat

  the doctor picked up suit case bag
and gun case and turned toward the
hotel aradia as he stumped up the
weed-grown path i glanced westward
the round red sun had reached the
treetops even as i watched it sank as
with a sudden plunge behind the west-
ern hills and was gone

  sunset and con lesky must be in
the very thickest of ordogs wood i
wondered vaguely what he might meet
there among its shadows and cursed
myself for a superstitious foo and fol-
lowed the medical examiner
satans wood



chapter iii

the aradia hotel

     we stumbled up that weed-grown
path the huge black cat sat upon
the doorstep and watched inscrutably
in all the visible prospect there was no
other sign of life yet it seemed to me
that our every movement was watched
by something invisible as keenly as by
that enormous coal-black cat

  the beast sat still until we wrere al-
most upon it then it rose abruptly
yellow eyes aflame and arched its back
and opened its red mouth and spat at us
soundlessly its fierce triangular face
was a mask of demoniac hatred laid
back ears bushy tail sharp claws all
spoke of such fury that involuntarily t
halted

  doctor moran chuckled if aradia
has any votary hereabouts this would
be a splendid familiar he declared
nodding at the cat and then quite
undisturbed by the brutes menacing
attitude he set foot on the doorstep

  with a movement so swift that the
eye could not follow it the great black
cat whirled and darted into the shrub-
bery which grew thick and untrimmed
all about the house it was there and
it was gone and it needed no great
stretch of imagination to fancy that it
had vanished instead of running away

  in the same instant the closed front
door ornamented with a knocker cast
in the shape of a human head which
wore two short horns swung silently
back and we saw an old woman in the
aperture

  she wras a gaunt old lady much
stooped and bent with thin gray hair
drawn tightly back and knotted oddly
enough with a bright-red ribbon her
nose was large and hooked and her
pointed chin thrust forward she was
toothless so that her jaws shut together
like nutcrackers and nose and chin
seemed almost to touch as in old pic-
tures of witches beneath shaggy gray

eyebrows her deep-set eyes were
rheumy and red-rimmed and to me they
seemed haunted by some secret terror
altogether she was a strange old
woman and one who three centuries
ago might well have been burned at the
stake merely because of her eerie look
and the great black cat she kept

  but she smiled at us pleasantly
enough and when she spoke she
seemed a kindly innocent old lady as
one might wish to meet

  this is doctor moran isnt it and
doctor pelton too come right in
gentlemen elvira elvira drat
that girl shes mooning again sorry
you had to fetch your own baggage
con ought to have fetched it in before
he went but come right in gentlemen
and warm yourselves gets chilly
around sunset for all its only october
supperll be on the table in a jiffy

  so she ushered us in talking all the
while and brought us to a large pleas-
antly furnished sitting room in which a
log fire burned in a fireplace almost as
large as a hall bedroom the room was
brightly lighted with oil lamps but the
shades were so closely drawn that not
the least ray could escape to lighten the
dusk without the fire crackled and
snapped cheerfully and from the rear a
faint delicious smell of cookery floated
in to our eager nostrils

  doctor moran settled his thick body
in an armchair and spread out blunt
hands to the blaze chin on his great
arched chest he looked all around turn-
ing his eyes but not his head as was
his habit

  har-rumph quite a contrast he
mumbled outside was just the least
bit-er well ghostly so to say but
inside-fine he sniffed hugely
smells good doesnt it i cant re-
member when we ate last can you

  a long time ago i declared sin-
cerely im all ready to eat again

  our hostess had disappeared but now
she returned thrusting before her a


detective story magazine

slatternly figure clad in a soiled red
dress come on now vera she
scolded fine lot of good you are to
me mooning around like you do why
werent you outside to get these gentle-
mens bags take and fetch em up-
stairs now and hurry up about it
she turned to us

  more trouble trying to get anything
out of her than to do it myself she

complained but then- she

looked around elvira had gone out
carrying a bag in either hand mrs
manew tapped  her forehead but
then she aint hardly accountable
comes from that raggles tribe back in
the hills and theyre no bettern half-
wits all of em live just like animals
they do

  the slattern came shuffling back and
i looked at her curiously she was
young surely not more than twenty but
her face was drawn and wizened like
that of an old woman it was a rabbit-
like face almost chinless with narrow
jaws and protruding teeth over which
inadequate lips refused to close her
eyes were prominent and watery and
very pale almost colorless and they
were vacant and dull no light of in-
telligence shone in them the girl was
patently an imbecile it did not need
her crumpled ears her symmetrical fea-
tures one eye set half an inch higher
than its mate nor her microcephalic
head scarcely half the normal size to
tell me that her vacant glance alone
betrayed her

  for the rest she was gaunt and ill
made with huge hands and feet she
shuffled awkwardly stumbling over her
own feet and her loose lips were set in
a never-changing silly grin it was
pitiful

  dont earn her keep mrs manew
complained more troublen shes
worth a sight elvira raggles pick
up them bags and fetch em upstairs
you hear me stand there gaping

  elvira giggled emptily and obeyed

doctor moran gave our hostess a ques-
tioning glance its good of you to
put up with her said he but
wouldnt she be better off in some in-
stitution 

 a sight better mrs manew
agreed been in trouble already el-
vira has ony them raggleses dont
think nothing of that wouldnt know
enough to call it trouble even got a

baby bout two year old she-

  a beam in the ancient ceiling creaked
sharply and mrs manew stopped short
with an apprehensive glance upward
theres lots of queer noises in this old
house a bodyd think sometimes the
roofd fall in onto your head but its
good and solid gentlemen you dont
need to worry

  i fancied that the look of secret ap-
prehension in her deep-set eyes was
more pronounced certainly she fid-
geted nervously arranging vases on the
mantel shelf and she would say no
more about elvira raggles though we
both questioned her when doctor
moran suggested again that the girl be-
longed in an institution mrs manew
only shrugged

  cant none of us do what-all wed
like to she evaded theres reasons

i- she checked herself a look of

manifest fear in her strange eyes
your suppers all ready better come
on in and set up

  thankfully we sat down to an ex-
cellent hot meal mrs manew seemed
the very soul of hospitality she pressed
food upon us and smiled at our appe-
tites when we had finished she
showed usupstairs to our bedrooms

  we were her only guests she ex-
plained usually she had five or six at
this time but this year no one else had
copie times were hard on account of
the stock market so folks claimed
though she didnt know anything about
that she hoped wed like our rooms

  they were very pleasant indeed
large and airy and comfortably fur-
satans wood



nished there was even a well-equipped
bathroom between them the water
came from springs back on the hillside
mrs manew told us there were no
electric lights but she planned to have a
small electric plant installed another
year

  the house was small as i have said
these second-floor rooms were low-
ceiled with dormer windows and there
wras no third floor i could see only two
doors beside our own which opened
into the hall and i wondered idly
where our hostess could put six guests
if she had them

  looking absently out through the
half-open door of my room while i lis-
tened to mrs manews chatter i saw
the door opposite move silently it
opened a little way and i fancied that i
could see a flutter of black garments
through the crack

  why youve got another guest
said i forgetting what she had told us
well have to remember theres a lady
on the floor moran

  mrs manew looked frightened
why no she fluttered no no
there aint another body in the house-
not a one elvira and-elvira she
sleeps in an outhouse and my rooms
downstairs in the lean-to aint another
soul in the house ony you gentlemen
i wondered at her insistence i
thought i saw the door across the hall
swing open that was all

  mustve been the wind yes sir
doctor o course it was the wind
this explanation appeared to relieve
her so much that i said no more though
the night was singularly still but that
huge cat might have pushed the door
open and as for the draperies i had
fancied they might have been no more
than the play of shadows from a flicker-
ing oil lamp

   was too tired and sleepy to be very
curious anyhow so i yawned and
said good night to mrs manew and
prepared to retire doctor moran sat

for a moment in front of the fireplace-
for there was a fireplace in each room
with a glowing log fire therein-smok-
ing and pondering then he stretched
his long thick arms and rose

  aradia said he thoughtfully its
well named a grand place for witch-
craft sure enough mrs manew would
pass for a witch anywhere and we saw
her familiar outside

  and elvira i suppose is the prin-
cess whom she has bewitched i sug-
gested trying to make a joke of it

 doctor moran gave me a queer
glance elvira has been bewitched all
right he answered did you see
what she wore around her neck
why no what then

  take a look in the morning and see
what you think of it ho-hum im
going to bed sorcery or none its a
comfortable place this m-mm but
those biscuits were good and also the
maple sirup good night johnny my
lad

chapter iv

coven

i was up betimes and dressed and
went out into the fresh fragrant
morning air the sun was just rising
it was crisply cold and bracing so that i
felt young and exuberant and whistled
cheerfully as i walked around the old
house

  early as i was doctor moran had
been before me for i met him striding
stoutly along on his thick short bandy
legs and humming in a sub-cellar bass
rocked in the cradle of the deep
the last word came in a vibrant or-
gan tone that was almost too deep for a
human larynx to compass bravo i
applauded making believe to clap my
hands

  har-rumph the medical exam-
iner seemed embarrassed how do
you like the aradia by now

  fine i think were going to enjoy
it here


detective story magazine

  we stood beside the ancient house
where we could see the kitchen garden
at its rear and a small structure a cou-
ple of rods behind it apparently made
of logs this was the outhouse no
doubt where elvira raggles slept

  my guess was verified almost at once
for the slatternly girl emerged from it
her thin sandy hair all in tangles about
her tiny head her pale eyes swollen
with sleep she carried a shapeless
bundle in her arms and her face was
bent over it and she crooned to it tune-
lessly

  for all the asymmetry the imbecility
of her wizened face elvira raggles
was almost beautiful in that moment
her pale eyes were bright with mother
love her smile was tender she
clutched the squirming bundle awk-
wardly enough but as carefully as
though she held the worlds greatest
treasure

  then seeing us she started back with
a feral snarl like some wild animal sur-
prised and ready to defend its young
doctor moran spoke to her gently

  good morning elvira is that your
baby

  the womans face changed once
more it was vacant silly idiotic uh-
huh she nodded grinning

  let us see wont you

  she hesitated then advanced warily
and we looked at what she held

  it was a child of two years perhaps
-a pitiful object with the huge bulg-
ing head of the hydrocephalic and be-
neath it a pinched little visage like a
monkeys face from which bright black
eyes peered knowingly the little crea-
ture was deformed rachitic unwhole-
some its eyes were sore its skin was
blotched and roughened and it wore as
such children sometimes do an expres-
sion of uncanny evil wisdom such as
might have shone from the eyes of a
very ancient very learned and quite un-
principled woman yet to its mother
it was precious for she held it lovingly

and awaited our praise with patent
pride as if to say of course my baby
is wonderful

  i strove to look admiring and mut-
tered a few words and put out a finger
to touch that pitifully wrinkled cheek
the child stared at me coldly contemp-
tuously with that air of precocious wis-
dom so that i almost blushed doctor
moran rubbed his long heavy chin

  an unusual baby he declared with
complete conviction unique in fact
har-rumph

  the uncanny little creature burst into
sudden elfin mirth elvira grinned her
foolish grin and eyed the medical ex-
aminer with abject gratitude you-
youre good she declared and came
closer

  listen she whispered glancing
furtively about listen you go away
fom here gwan quick it aint-
aint-healthy

  maybe we know how to take care
of ourselves elvira replied the
doctor look and he showed her
his left hand its two middle fingers
folded into the palm its little finger and
forefinger stiffly extended in that sign
of the homed hand that con lesky had
made last night what was the man
getting at

  but elvira grinned widely and
nodded as though completely enlight-
ened oh well o course if youre
one of them over there-jerking her
head sidewise to the left-that makes
it-

  elvira elvira raggles you come
here this minute

  frightened elvira wheeled toward
the house yesm yesm yesm she
shrilled cornin stumbling over
her own feet she turned to her cabin
and darted into it to emerge again
presently without her child and shuffle
toward the house

  lets take a stroll johnny my lad
suggested doctor moran how about
it mrs manew he raised his
satans wood



voice to a bass shout mrs manew
have we time for a walk before break-
fast

  i guess so answered our hostess
in a shrill quaver breakfast wont be
ready fr an hour amost didnt figger
youd be getting up quite so early as
this

  so we set off toward the road and
crossed it and struck into the woods
beyond doctor moran wore ancient
corduroy breeches and leather putties
and thick-soled shoes and i too was
roughly dressed so that we feared
neither mud nor brambles and the
deep woodland was inviting and this
morning cheerful and innocuous
enough full of the songs of birds and
the loud chattering of squirrels wild
flowers bloomed here and there late as
it was and chipmunks whisked about
and a partridge rose with a sudden
thunder of wings almost beneath our
feet it was very pleasant in the
woods my vague fears of last night
were forgotten quite ordogs wood
satans wood indeed this was a de-
lightful spot to one who loved nature
and seldom had a chance to commune
with her

  we walked on doctor moran and i
deeper and deeper into the thick wood
wild furtive furry creatures were all
about eying us dubiously from treetops
or darting behind fallen logs to hide
or racing up and down thick trunks to
scold angrily at our intrusion

  we took no heed of direction mov-
ing now this way to examine an un-
usually tall tree now that way to look
at a fern now the other way to watch
a busy squirrel so that after half an
hour or so we had no more than reached
the center of the woodland which was
scarcely a mile wide i was about to
suggest that we turn back when my rov-
ing eye caught a glint of something
rough and gray

  hello said  we must be near
the road we drove over last night

heres the chapel that scared young
lesky so

  i started toward it and the doctor
followed but we did not reach the
ruined church that morning we could
see it plainly standing in a tiny clearing
-a tumble-down structure whose stee-
ple tilted perilously and half of whose
roof had fallen in it was all built of
gray stone moss covered and evidently
very old and long deserted beside it
was a small graveyard in which mossy
stone slabs canted this way and that

  but as we went toward the old chapel
we saw another clearing before us and
suddenly debouched into a circular open
space it might have been forty feet in
diameter and it was so regular in out-
line that one felt it must be artificial
beyond it the woods began again and
through them between close-set trunks
 could see the old chapel it was far-
ther away than i had thought more
than a hundred yards even now

  i would have struck across the clear-
ing without pausing but doctor mb-
rans shrill whistle checked me and i
turned my companion had stopped in
the middle of the open space and wras
leaning over a big rough boulder which
stood there

  come here johnny pelton he
called in a queer dry voice and tell
me what you think of this

  i obeyed and as i came glanced
about the clearing more carefully it
was round as i have said and in it no
tree grew nor any bush or shrub not
even a fern or weed or stalk of grass
grew here the earth was bare and
brown and packed hard and smooth
like the floor of a clay tennis court save
at the center where about that boulder
a few glossy thick-leaved plants grew
lustily and bore odd dark-red fleshy-
looking flowers

  the boulder beside which doctor
moran stood was of hard igneous rock
shaped no doubt by some moving gla-
cier in ancient times i am no geologist

to give it a name but it was of a yellow-
ish-gray color flecked here and there
with rust-colored spots and it surface
though irregular was fairly smooth it
was half buried in the earth at the exact
center of the clearing it stood perhaps
four feet above ground and its diame-
ter was considerably greater its top
was somewhat flattened and had been
discolored by fire apparently alto-
gether the thing somehow suggested a
primitive altar stone

  doctor moran stood watching me
chin on chest his yellow eyes very
bright he seemed oddly interested al-
most excited

  what do you make of it he asked
why i answered uncertainly i
dont know some old indian relic per-
haps it makes one think of an altar
har-rumph it does indeed but
look again johnny my lad look
closer stooping he pointed to that
side of the stone which faced east

  here the hard surface of the boul-
der had been chipped and scored ob-
viously by human hands some one
had used a chisel there i saw several
roughly graved symbols-something
vaguely like a pin wheel and on either
side other crude carvings

  why some little boys have been
here i exclaimed

  but the medical examiner shook his
head his great square face was grim
he shook a blunt forefinger beneath my
nose his deep voice cracked and
leaped two octaves to a shrill falsetto
blast it man use your eyes use
your brain if any he pointed that
is a swastika and that is the lingham
and that the yoni

  as suddenly as it had arisen his ap-
parent fury subsided he smiled am-
iably thrust both hands deep into his
pockets and nodded at me in short
he said in his normal bass if youd be
reasonable instead of flying into a tem-
per youd realize that you are taking a
very superficial view of these carvings

very i tell you man this is an altar
right enough but its no indian relic
look around you he pointed to the
hard-packed earth dancing feet have
pounded that so flat yes and recently
too see theres not one single weed in
the ring and these carvings-theres
no moss in them the rock is fresh
unweathered where the chisel has cut
those carvings have been made within
a year at most

  i wondered idly at this excitement
what of it what do you think it
means then

  it means this witchcraft demon-
olatry devil worship if you like
just that he paused glaring at me
defiantly from bushy brows

  i laughed uneasily nonsense in
this day and age

  why not devil worship isnt dead
yet by a long shot listen he
checked off the points on thick blunt
fingers a house called aradia and
aradia is the goddess of witches lo-
cated where why in witch hollow
and here in a forest called ordogs-
that is satans-wood we find a
beaten circle a fairies ring no less
such as one finds to this day in eng-
land where witches held their sabbats
once close by is a churchyard inhab-
ited by a vrolek-a vampire isnt all
that enough even without finding the
very altar stone graved with the ling-
ham and yoni and swastika

  do you seriously suggest-

  he brushed my wrords aside these
are primitive people even con lesky
is very superstitious they came from
the balkan peninsula which is of all
countries in the world the most ghost
haunted and full of sorceries why
shouldnt they bring their own beliefs
their own superstitions if you like to
this country with them and ob-
viously they have

  we-ell i said dubiously over-
borne by his insistent heat well if
so what of it it doesnt concern us
satans wood



  har-rumph t hope not johnny
doctor moran shook his great head so
that his fulvous mane waved loosely

i hope not but- devil worship

is evil my son naturally enough
yes and halloween is almost here-the
time for the autumn festival-the
witches sabbat i hope no innocent

child-

  he broke off abruptly his face was
white but thats rot of course he
glared at me accusingly as though the
suggestion had been my own nobody
but a fool would think of such things
come along johnny pelton lets go
home to breakfast

  without more words we set our
faces toward the aradia hotel for a
while doctor moran clumped along in
moody silence then he spoke

  humph said he ten days more
johnny i think that when the local
coven meets on halloween you and i
will be hidden right here or hereabout
it ought to be interesting practical
study in anthropology har-rumph
something gray flitted across an open
space before us and vanished again i
started violently my nerves had been
shaken despite my incredulity by doc-
tor morans remarks wh-whats
that

  the doctor stopped short where
ah quite what is it elvira

  the slattern emerged from behind a
tree finger in her mouth giggling fool-
ishly mrs manew she says-

  elvira the medical examiner chal-
lenged elvira whats that you wear
around your neck

  she clutched at her scrawny throat
hiding something-i could not see what
-that hung from a string like a scapu-
lar she seemed frightened she could
not speak but only goggled at us

  is it this asked doctor moran
and he stooped and scratched a crude
drawing on the earth with a bit of twig

  elvira raggles gasped you-you
know too then you are-

   ashtoreth-asmodeus  quoted
doctor moran we have heard the
word the cat spoke to the ass

  elvira

  it was mrs manews voice doubt-
less it must have been and yet that
distant call rang silver clear and sweet
so that i wondered how the old
ladys withered throat could compass it
the carrying sound floated across the
valley to be echoed from the farther
hills elvira elvira

  elvira heard and squeaked aloud in
ludicrous yet evident fear clutching
her draggled red skirts about her she
fled calling over a shoulder break-
fas all ready like i said and i aint
said nothing else neither-not a word
she seemed to be denying it not to us
but to some unseen auditor

  then she was gone and we two were
left staring at each other in silence
after a while doctor moran shook his
head somberly

  a black business he rumbled
mark my words johnny pelton a
black black business

chapter v

baby ruth

we walked on but before we
reached the edge of ordogs
wood i heard a baby crying dolefully

  must be a lost child said i and
with my companion hurried toward the
sound

  sitting on the ground beneath a huge
old tree we found a little girl-a mere
babe scarcely more than two years old
her golden curls were tousled her
pretty face was scratched and soiled
and tears hopped down her rounded
dimpled cheeks in one chubby fist she
clutched a straggling bouquet of wilted
wild flowers

  seeing us she emitted one last wail
then blinked her wet eyes and smiled
trustfully

  youse an awful while cornin she


detective story magazine

accused i cried an cried an nobody
earned till now she sniffled briefly
then scrambled to her feet but baby
ruthll fogive she good girl baby
ruth fogive everbody wanna go
home now

  and she trotted up to us and thrust a
chubby earth-stained hand out to each
my mamma wants me take me
there pease see i pick some fowers
wont she be peased 

  a trustful friendly mite and pretty
as a picture grubby though she was
doctor moran laughed aloud and swept
her up to his great shoulder where she
sat quite contentedly chattering to us
both

  whats your mothers name i
asked her

  why mamma jus mamma ats
all an me im baby ruth ever-
body knows baby ruth

  i could well believe that everybody
in the neighborhood did know baby
ruth and love her she was such a
dainty affectionate precocious mite
but we had not had that honor as yet
where does your mamma live
wite over there she pointed
vaguely no-o i guess there no-o
baby ruths losted

  her face puckered dolefully she
seemed about to weep once more then
she blinked back the tears and smiled
down at me dimpling not losted
now though she corrected with
pretty courtesy nice mens founded
me so now its aw-wite isnt it

  i assured her that it was and a mo-
ment later we broke through a thicket
and emerged upon the highroad to
our left i could see the gable of the
aradia hotel beneath its surrounding
everygreen trees and far to the right i
caught a glimpse of a red barn

toward this baby ruth pointed con-
fidently mamma she lives there so
does baby ruth with mamma see
but we need not go all the way pres-
ently i saw a womans figure hurrying

toward us and pausing at intervals to
shade her eyes and look this way and
that faintly i could hear her call
ruth-ie ba-byruth

  who-oo here i is

  baby ruth shrilled her answer wav-
ing so violently that she almost fell
from the doctors shoulder as we
hurried on she kept explaining at the
top of her lungs

  is aw-wite mamma dear i got
losted ony these nice mens founded
me baby ruth got losted and founded
and everthing aw-wite an see what

nice pitty fowers i pickted an-

  the woman who ran toward us was
calico clad and a flapping sunbonnet hid
her face yet one could see from her
graceful slender figure and swift lithe
movements that she was young-and i
guessed attractive of course the
mother of this fairy child must be
pretty too

  now she was within a few yards her
arms already outstretched beneath
her sunbonnet golden ringlets clustered
about a smooth oval face comely and
dimpled but pale now with remembered
alarm she was breathless

  oh baby baby how you frightened
me she gasped and seized the child
and hugged her desperately are you
safe are you hurt she began to
look baby ruth all over to feel her
limbs to look anxiously into her smiling
face dimpling and chuckling the baby
hugged her babbling of the pitty
fowers she had brought

  after a little her fears somewhat
quieted the young woman looked at us
you been awful good she began
nervously i-thank you so much
she was very shy and the color came
and went deliciously in her fair cheeks
she spoke with a faint foreign accent
as one not entirely used to the english
language yet as she told us later she
had been born in witch hollow but
most families hereabout spoke some
balkan tongue at home
satans wood



  baby ruth been in the woods the
child insisted tugging at her mothers
sleeves way way way back in the
woods-got losted

  her mother gasped in the wood
youve been in ordogs wood oh-h
baby ruth

  the woman was aghast her agitation
wras pitiful her face grew pale and
pinched and she crossed herself fre-
vently and whispered a prayer and
then made that ancient sign of the
horned hand

  breakfast will be waiting t re-
minded doctor moran lets get
started

  but the lady would not have us go
thus excuse me please she begged
i must thank you both so much to
find my baby me i am marie skelly
and this is my baby ruthie skelly
skelly i queried certainly she
did not look irish

  szekeli the medical examiner cor-
rected szekeli you are magyar
mrs szekeli 

  she nodded eagerly and plunged into
a guttural foreign tongue but doctor
moran shook his head smiling no i
cant understand sorry but  knew
the name they are a brave people the
szekelis

  mrs szekeli-or skelly as i shall
call her since it was thus that her name
had been corrupted-noddes proudly
but about those woods i am much
troubled for my baby these are most
bad woods how shall i say stre-
goica what you call witch work in
those woods is a wampyr that has al-
ready taken two babes she crossed
herself again

  two babies queried doctor mo-
ran sharply

  mrs skelly nodded on walpurgis-
nacht a year ago one little boy petey
lesky a year old only on allhallows
before another babe-a girl my own
husbands cousins baby celeste we
can only pray baby ruth said she

sternly if you go again in the wood
mamma must whip hard

  the child sniffed and choked back a
sob baby ruth fogive she good
girl she quavered

 come we go home now mrs
skelly turned to us and dropped a
quaint old-fashioned curtsey we
thank you very much ruthie and i to
have saved her from evil god go with
you sirs

  and with you madam replied
doctor moran very courteously and
may he watch over you both and pro-
tect you from evil always

  off they went baby ruth bobbing on
her mothers shoulder and looking back
often to wave at us doctor moran
and  walked swiftly up the road to-
ward the hotel aradia we were both
hungry we had little to say

  but once and again the medical ex-
aminer shook his great head forebod-
ingly and rumbled dee in his throat
two babies already and halloween
comes in ten days

  then he stopped short in the road
johnny pelton he said gravely with-
out a trace of that illogical heat he so
often affected johnny pelton there is
an evil abroad here-an ugly ancient
evil mystery that must be cleared up
an evil that must be exercised before
other innocent babies perish

 i gaped at him perish you
think these children were murdered
oh surely not that

  har-rumph said doctor moran
cryptically im hungry

chapter vi

changeling

a fter what we had seen that morn-
ing and particularly after doctor
morans vague references to some great
and sinister mystery mrs sarah ma-
news breakfast table was satisfyingly
matter-of-fact delicious buckwheat
pancakes with home-churned butter


detective story magazine

and real maple sirup fried salt pork
and thick milk gravy hot biscuits and
honey savory fried potatoes steaming
coffee-all these were not only delight-
ful to a hungry man but somehow ob-
scurely comforting in a world which
offered such matters i felt there could
not be anything very terrible by the
time my ravenous appetite was ap-
peased i was ready to smile incredu-
lously at the medical examiners dark
sayings

  but when breakfast was over and we
two sat smoking before a cheery open
fire my curiosity got the better of me

  look here moran i began how
much truth was there in that rigmarole
about sorcery-if any and how much
of it was an attempt to scare me into
seeing witches behind every tree

  the doctor shrugged his thick shoul-
ders and turned his whole body until
he faced me squarely i didnt even
think of scaring you he denied

  for a while he smoked in silence
his yellow eyes like the eyes of a sleepy
lion brooding upon the fire then be
spoke

  witchcraft said doctor aloysius
moran is a religion a cult if you
like and to-day a small cult though
larger than you might believe johnny
pelton yet it is a cult-a religion-
and a very old one nobody knows
how old certainly it was known in
ancient egypt and assyria and chal-
dea-all over the ancient world in
old testament days when the children
of israel went astray and worshiped
strange gods it was the witch cult
which seduced them most often

  he paused a moment then you
remember moloch whose image held a
blazing furnace into which babies were
cast alive  youve heard of the god-
dess ashtoreth who was astarte who
was hecate the horned goddess of the
moon

  i thought diana- i objected

but he waved me aside

  diana yes but it was hecate who
was the goddess of the dark of the
moon and the goddess of witches or
as the aradia myth has it diana her-
self during the dark of the moon car-
ried on scandalously and so had a
daughter by lucifer who is aradia
goddess of witches at any rate moon
worship has always had this darker
side witchcraft has always been in
part a fertility religion but there is
another element too and there satan
comes in the worship of pan was
witchcraft also-so much so that to this
day the personal devil of christian
legend wears the horns and hoofs of
pan and has the legs of a goat pan
asmondeus janicot ahriman-they
are all one the prince of this world
and witches worship him also

  you mean they did

  i mean they do now to-day in
this land of the free oh not many
perhaps yet the prince of this world
has his followers

  but devil wrorship isnt the same
thing as witchcraft

  there are cults of satanists true-
like the yezidees of persia who do not
quite belong to the witch cult yet all
of them practice incantation and work
by spells the witch religion is not ex-
actly satan worship though rather
theologists have taken the satan idea
from the witch cult janicot is not the
christians satan he is older much
older and different he is the prince of
this world-the prince of the power of
the air whose symbols are the lingham
and the yoni and whose worship is very
ancient very ancient indeed and al-
ways evil quite as evil to-day when
his ritual has been changed and cor-
rupted as it was thousands of years
ago when men called him moloch
youve been hinting around long
enough do you actually mean to sit
there and tell me that human sacrifice
is still practiced-in these united
states 
satans wood



  doctor moran sighed heavily no
smile lit his somber face can you
deny it wasnt a witch murdered in
pennsylvania within the year

  that silenced me for i remembered
reading of at least two murders com-
mitted near york of two so-called
witch doctors hexes slain by their
imagined victims

  thats not the same as human sacri-
fice i argued feebly

  har-rumph said my companion
idiot

  after that he refused to continue the
discussion maybe i imagined it all
i hope so

  a new thought struck me whats
that thing elvira wears around her
neck i demanded and what did
you draw on the ground with that twig 
i couldnt see yes and what did you
mean about the word the cat spoke to
the ass

  doctor moran grinned tantalizingly
there are no witches yet elvira
who is surely no mental giant under-
stood both my sign and my words she
is an initiate johnny pelton

  well are you dont tell me you
are initiated into this witch cult you
talk about because i wont believe it
you neednt my bold lad and im
not but i got it all out of printed
books johnny pelton-as you might if
youd been studious enough you can
find out about the mysteries by consult-
ing anthropological authorities go to
it dear friend afterward you can
try out your knowledge on elvira and
see if she reacts

  i gave it up its nothing that in-
terests me i lied meanwhile are
you planning to sit here all day or will
you come out into the air and work up
an appetite for dinner

  the medical examiner heaved up his
bulk and we went outdoors for the
rest of that day and for the days that
followed we led a delightfully lazy
comfortable existence we hunted or

pretended to carrying guns which we
had no intention of using we fished
and even caught a horn pout or so
which our hostess fried very nicely
but for the most part we wandered
idly about beneath the trees or climbed
the surrounding hills to see what lay
beyond them which invariably proved
to be more hills-or held long desul-
tory discussions 

  gradually we came to know the peo-
ple who lived thereabout shy kindly
primitive folks and very superstitious
at first they held aloof and scarcely
spoke to us but doctor morans per-
sonality-for he could be very winning
when he chose-soon drew them closer
me they came to accept after a while
almost as one of themselves but the
medical examiner they regarded as some
one greater wiser more learned than
they to him they brought their diffi-
culties and disputes and he listened
gravely and made simple explanations
or gave just judgment it was surpris-
ing to see how quickly he came to be an
authority among the witch hollow
people

  it was surprising too to see how
much more thickly the hollow was
populated than it had at first appeared
from the aradia house we could see
but one other dwelling-the skellys-
and that only in part and by an effort
but we soon learned that a number of
other farms were scattered about so
that fully two hundred folks dwelt in
the wedge-shaped valley called witch
hollow little irregular-shaped patches
of arable land lay here and there along
the creek bottoms perhaps a fourth of
the country which at first had seemed
quite wild was under plow

  as i say they were a primitive peo-
ple who rarely left their hills for the
most part they were czechs or slo-
vaks or szekelis or magyars i am not
skilled enough in race to say exactly
which at any rate they or their fore
bears hailed from the balkan peninsula


detective story magazine

being the remnant of a considerable col-
ony which had emigrated from the old
country nearly a century ago to settle
hereabout-perhaps because the moun-
tains were homelike to them most of
them still spoke their native tongue by
preference and some had no english
whatever in some ways they must
have been a little like the pennsylvania
dutch i suppose though in others they
were very different

  without exception they were densely
superstitious all believed firmly in
witchcraft and sorcery and charms and
in ghosts and demons and vampires at
least a dozen of them assured us that
there was an indubitable vrolek wam-
pyr or vampire which inhabited the
churchyard beside that ruined chapel
but when i asked why the chapel had
been deserted none would answer
they only shook their heads and went
on driving six miles over the mountains
to the church in a near-by town

  one other matter i must speak of in
passing though it has little enough to
do with my tale far back in the hills
in country wilder than the hollow
dwelt a peculiar half-savage folk known
as the raggles tribe these were part
indian or so folks maintained and
part negro-a clan made up of out-
laws and runaway slaves and ren-
egade indians originally which had
dwelt apart inbreeding for eighty years
without law or morals or schooling un-
til most if not all had become feeble-
minded and deformed i have known
one other such tribe scarcely less de-
generate in western new york and
such must have been the tribes described
by one or two anthropologists

  i mention these strange creatures be-
cause of their scientific interest to stu-
dents and because the queer slatternly
girl elvira was one of them-and for
one other reason

  thus our days slipped by one after
another and we enjoyed them to the
full it is strange to remember how

rapidly we became accustomed doctor
moran and i to this life and for that
while how simple and wholesome and
cheerfully normal it seemed

  for that while only-because a
strange and shocking thing occurred
which changed theatmosphere of witch
hollow for us we had been at the
aradia hotel for ten days-long
enough to grow used to elviras oddi-
ties and to become sincerely attached to
mrs sarah manew in spite of her
eerie witchlike appearance-when the
blow fell that was on the twenty-
ninth of october and i shall never
while i live forget that date

  we had seen baby ruth skelly but
twice since our first meeting with her
for her mother kept her close at home
lest she wander off again and so on the
evening of the twenty-eighth doctor
moran suggested that we walk to the
skelly place next morning to visit the
child we both had come to love

  that was at supper when the doc-
tor spoke i fancied that mrs manew
looked at us strangely the hidden terror
which always lurked in her sunken eyes
more visible than usual and elvira
raggles who waited on us dropped a
plate and broke it but that was nothing
unusual for her

  ill be glad to go and see her i
agreed shes a very attractive child

  mrs manew spoke in a strained
quavering voice elvira go to your
own room for a minute and when
the slattern had shuffled out she leaned
far across the table toward us two and
whispered earnestly

  doctor moran and doctor pelton
i-ive come to be fond of you kind

of i wish- hadnt you better go

on back to new york the both of you
in the morning early i can get con
lesky to come after you

  we stared at her in amazement
but why on earth i protested we
planned to stay a month and we like it
here i dont want to leave do you
satans wood



  doctor moran shook his head he
was eying our hostess keenly why
no id much rather stay unless of
course mrs manew wants to get rid
of us

  the old lady wet her lips her
skinny fingers plaited the tablecloth
she was so uneasy so terribly in ear-
nest that i was almost alarmed

  i dont want you to- but i wish

for your own sakes-

  then came a distinct knocking from
the ceiling exactly as though some one
in the room overhead had tapped writh
a stick now this was the room whose
door was opposite my own the night
we came i had fancied a movement
therein but ever since the door had
been closed and locked-for i had tried
it once

  elvira must have gone upstairs
said i though i did not believe that

  but mrs manew flinched and turned
ghastly pale her shrunken lips quiv-
ered that constant look of fear deep-
ened in her dim old eyes until i pitied
her she seemed so panic-stricken
when she spoke her voice quivered
like a violin string overstrained

  its nothing-nothing queer noises
you hear in old houses like this a
bodyd almost think they was folks
around or spooks maybe she forced
a laugh but it was a dreadful mirth-
less sound somehow her eyes avoided
mine

  no its nothing ony the timbers
cracking what was it i was saying
oh yes i mean i wish youd stay
both of you just as long as you can
its a real pleasure having you you
dont make a mite of trouble so i do
hope you wont let anything interfere
with staying your time out leastways
until after hal-after the first of next
month

  i glanced at doctor moran and he
stared back at me his tawny eyebrows
were raised and there was an odd spec-
ulative quality in the look he presently

turned upon our hostess he cleared
his throat

  har-rumph said the medical ex-
aminer quite yes mrs manew
we are planning to stay if youll keep
us

  the old lady relaxed heaving a trem-
ulous sigh yet that secret trouble
which lurked in her deep-set eyes was
undiminished rather it seemed in-
creased so that i wondered why she had
so suddenly changed her mind queer
noises in an old house that had been
a queer noise surely for ancient tim-
bers to emit unaided and yet there
could be no one upstairs

  doctor moran and i went to bed
early indeed we had to for that brac-
ing mountain air so stimulated us to
physical activity during the day that
evening found us too sleepy to stay
awake we slept soundly all night long
and when i rose and looked out at the
round bright sun as it topped the east-
ern hills i thought that i had never
seen a more idyllic spot nor one more
conducive to wholesome simple living

  before two hours had passed i was
disillusioned

  mrs manew was nowhere to be seen
the medical examiner and i breakfasted
alone served by elvira raggles and
that slattern seemed unusually distrait
and clumsy she spilled coffee down
my back gave us vinegar instead of
maple sirup and broke three dishes
her eyes were red and swollen and she
sniffled constantly she must have
caught cold i thought

  indeed she seemed so distressed and
upset that i sought to puf her at ease
casting about for a topic i remembered
that hideous hydrocephalic child of
hers and the obvious affection she had
shown it

  hows your baby elvira i in-
quired casually not sick i hope i
havent seen her for several days

  i expected her to brighten up at this
for when her child was mentioned her


detective story magazine

dull eyes would usually shine so that
she seemed almost human but instead
she set down her tray with a clatter
and threw a soiled apron over her face
and began to blubber outright then
she fled stumbling over her own feet
and nearly falling and the kitchen door
slammed behind her

  i glanced ruefully at my companion
i said the wrong thing evidently do
you suppose the child is really sick
maybe we ought to-

  doctor moran grunted it would
be a mercy he began and then char-
acteristically softened i hope not
poor brat well ask mrs manew
when she comes in

  but she did not come in and elvira
failed to answer repeated summons so
we finished our breakfast without fur-
ther attention and after it procured
caps and sticks and set out for the
skelly house a few rods away

  that was a beautiful morning the
air was balmy and soft like that of an
rtalian spring yet subtly bracing al-
ready heat waves began to shimmer
upward from the hard-packed road and
all around the horizon the soft haze of
indian summer made the harsh outlines
of the mountains diaphanous as mist i
sniffed the clear sweet air laden with a
resinous fragrance tinged with the scent
of distant burning leaves and sighed

  its a mighty good old world i
said its hard to believe that this
same sun shines on new york city
there the very air is heavy with pov-
erty and sordidness and vice and crime
here everything seems sweet and
wholesome and i laughed at my own
sentimentality yet what isaid seemed
true

  the medical examiner stopped short
in the road his great square face
turned purple he shook a thick fore-
finger beneath my nose

  simpleton he rumbled deep in his
barrel chest then his voice leaped to
a shrill falsetto of apparent fury

idiot idiot idiot he shrilled
crime says he and vice he says
johnny pelton i tell you that the worst
sinks of the gas-house district are sun-
day schools compared to this pernicious
spot

  abruptly his angry color faded he
took his finger from beneath my nose
stared at it intently as though to see if
t had bitten it and thrust both big
hands into his trouser pockets

  such wordy disputations are undig-
nified johnny pelton he continued in
his usual deep bass you should strive
to control your evil temper johnny my
fine lad he grinned at me amiably
and impudently be calm johnny as
i am and remember that there are
worse things than open crime much
worse johnny pelton very much
worse

  i was impressed in spite of myself by
his obvious sincerity yet i did not
wholly grasp his meaning you mean
tasked instinctively lowering my voice
though there was no one in sight you
mean this witchcraft stuff youve been
talking about

  maybe the doctor answered crypti-
cally maybe youll see for yourself
before very long

  we had reached the skelly farm and
turned off the main road into the drive
which led to the house and that big
red barn mounting the back steps
doctor moran tapped at the kitchen
door-for in the country one avoids
the front entrance of any house save
on ceremonial occasions such as a wed-
ding or a funeral

  no one was in sight mr skelly a
red-faced inarticulate bristly chinned
individual was in his fields no doubt 
and his wife must be at her household
tasks but it was strange that baby
ruth was not out this gorgeous morn-
ing

  doctor moran rapped again but no
one opened the door he hesitated his
face very grave and laid his ear against

            ds-c
satans wood



the wood listening i fancied i could
hear faint sobbing from within

  what- i began but the medi-
cal examiner waited for no speculation
he opened the door softly and went in
and i followed at his heels

  we entered a big roomy pleasant
kitchen it was spotlessly clean the
very dishes on the dresser shone at
our left stood a table covered by a red-
and-white cloth and littered with dishes
which still held remnants of a cold meal
that was an alien note in this meticu-
lous cleanliness it spoke with silent
eloquence of trouble

  for an instant my eyes had been
dazzled from the bright sunlight with-
out  then they cleared and i could see
the rest of the big room at my left
away from the windows stood a spot-
less kitchen range and beside it a high
chair in which sat a child it was
wrapped and bundled to the ears and its
back was toward me but i supposed it
was baby ruth

  but i was struck more by her moth-
ers occupation for mrs skelly stood
bent over the cookstove one of whose
lids had been lifted so that the fire with-
in flared up through it smokily the
young womans face was pallid and
swollen with hopeless grief her eyes
were red and dull and she kept them
fixed upon her task and that task
was so bizarre that i exclaimed aloud

  broken eggshells littered the floor
mrs skelly held a small wire-mesh
strainer on which was balanced half of
an empty eggshell which she was hold-
ing over the fire as though to broil it

  stranger yet the eggshell was full of
water and even as i stared at it the
water began to bubble and boil in that
extraordinary container

  what on earth- i began

to be continued in next weeks issue

  the young woman did not look up
she was unconscious of our presence
she stared across the fire at the child
opposite her sick heart in her eyes her
soft lips parted in unbearable despair-
ing expectancy

   as i watched the faint spark of hope
died away her mouth corners drew
down and she sobbed thickly but her
dull reddened eyes were dry its no
use-no use she groaned and dropped
to the floor and crouched there in a hud-
dled hopeless little heap heart-wrench-
ingly pitiful

  no use no use the charm wont
work and shes gone my babys gone
-lost

   i was still bewildered but the medical
examiner was white and grim and pur-
poseful he strode over to the crouch-
ing girl-for she was nothing more-
and lifted her gently

  tell me marie has anything hap-
pened to baby ruth

  meanwhile thinking to comfort her
by the sight of her child i had gone to
the high chair to lift her as i moved
the little creature in that chair stirred
and turned slowly to face me

  it was not baby ruth

  ah merciful heaven what could it
mean this horrid metamorphosis this
creature wras sickly unwholesome its
skin mottled and broken out its face
was pinched and tiny beneath a huge
bulging hydrocephalic dome-a head
like a pumpkin it stared at me with
bright black eyes that seemed to hold a
mocking evil wisdom so that i shud-
dered

  and then  heard the heartbroken
mothers wail

  changeling oh the changeling
oh have mercy doctor the little
people have taken my baby

his fast one

hed seen eternity looking out of guns too
often to get weak-kneed now

by donald van riper

author of call to victory etc

just wanted to be sure
rumbled allen spenser the
rumor reached me and
though i really did not credit
it nevertheless i thought id better
stop in and remind you that to-morrow
is something more than the day of exe-
cution for rossman

  im hardly apt to forget said the
governor with a measured smile that
to-morrow is primary day

  and added spenser pointedly
that i need but say the word and you
will fail to be renominated by the party
you may sign a stay of execution for
rossman but if you do it will be your
final important act as a public official
tt will mean you are through

  the governor nodded and contrived
another smile as allen spenser stood
looking back from the door of his office

spenser was too big a power to be de-
fied he must be nodded to smiled at
and obeyed that spensers attitude
was spiced with a desire for personal
vengeance against the man condemned
made the governors acquiescence a
foregone conclusion

  as a matter of public policy thun-
dered spenser there must be no le-
niency for cold-blooded killing crooks
like rossman he dropped his voice
discreetly lower before he thrust a re-
minder of his own peculiar personal in-
terest at the governor and the man
he killed was my own most trusted em-
ployee the head of my factories a man

i	would have been proud to own as my
son

  i understand said the governor
he bowed slightly but with a world of
deference in the action
his fast one



  as the door slammed  behind spen-
ser he straightened and stood there
scowling at the place where spenser had
stood there was a calculating com-
pression of the lips a thoughtful nar-
rowing of the eyes and not the least
trace of a smile remained upon his face
now he was double crossing allen
spenser but the latter would never
know until it was too late once let the
party renominate him and he would be
as good as reelected all the power
prestige and wealth of allen spenser
could not balk him once he had the nom-
ination to-morrow as spenser had
needlessly pointed out was indeed a
very important day in the career of gov-
ernor william courtney

  to-morrow was primary day to-
morrow morning at seven rossman
was to be executed if the news of a
stay of that execution became known
in time spenser might easily balk gov-
ernor william courtneys ambition
defeat in a party primary would finish
him victory in the primary-and
nothing could halt his subsequent elec-
tion

  william courtneys plan of action in
die case of the condemned man ross-
man was to grant the stay of execution
at the eleventh hour if the fact of
that stay of execution became known
only a minute or two before seven on
the morrow there would be scant time
left for allen spenser to strike back
much early voting would be done be-
fore the news would be on the streets
by the time the full force of allen
spensers opposition could be known
the issue would probably be settled ir-
revocably in favor of courtney

  governor william courtney  it was
a long and curious way which he had
traveled to reach this place of power
and the marks of it were clear in the
furrowed lines of his face and the pure
gray of his hair it was a queer bit-
ter double-crossing business in the
primary he feared the opposition of

spenser in the election itself it was
the power of men like big jack ban-

	igan that he dreaded

  only through holding back that stay
of execution until the last possible min-
ute could he hope to handled the two
opposing pressures which threatened
him with political extinction too late
would allen spenser learn that the gov-
ernor had signed the stay big jack
bannigan cared not how or when it was
done so long as there was no execution
on the morrow it would be close work
touch and go but then that was the sort
of trickery through which men like wil-
liam courtney gained their ends

  courtney knew this game and the
men who played it he knew that the
vital thing to-morrow was not whether
rossman should live or die but
whether he courtney should be renom-
inated therefore he was not surprised
when big jack bannigan put iri an ap-
pearance within half an hour after al-
len spenser had departed

  say bill began bannigan without
any preliminary of courtesy i just
got the word that spenser had been
here to see you and that he was laying
down the law about rossman

  your information answered gov-
ernor william courtney was approx-
imately correct

  say snapped bannigan you can
lay off the ninety-eight-cent words and
talk plain five and ten to me what i
came to see about is whether youre
staying put on signing rossman off for
thirty days more

  governor william courtney smiled
easily that easy smile was not the
least significant element in his ascent
from the depths of ward politics to his
present place at the top position within
the gift of the states electorate a
smile faintly humorous and yet pos-
sessed of a brooding appearance of wis-
dom a smile which had ever stood
him in good stead now he waited for
the full effect of that smile to work

upon big jack bannigan before he
spoke again

  ive already arranged everything
big jack bannigans frown softened
a bit at that i knew you would bill
but spenser doesnt know it yet and
he must not know it until the last pos-
sible minute you must not tell any
one-not a single soul-that just a few
minutes before seven to-morrow morn-
ing the stay of execution will be deliv-
ered to warden lafarge i can give
you positive assurance that rossman
will not die to-morrow of course i
just told spenser a lie i told him that
rossman would die

  for a high hatter that guy spenser
sure is bloodthirsty commented ban-
nigan just because rossman and
some other gun toters happened to kill
spensers right-hand man in swiping
that big pay roll from spensers fac-
tory why should spenser follow up a
thing like that into politics

  why countered courtney should
a bunch of reds try to make rossman
out as a political martyr  it was ross-
mans own friends who first put a po-
litical slant to this business

  why bannigan laughed heavily
a guy with your experience asking
that the only real reason in the world
theres money in it for some one
hows that

  bannigan grinned i cant tell you
the source of my info but i got it on
the level that it was rossman who got
away with the jack from the robbery
and before he was picked up he had
hidden it away somewhere and no one
else knew where he stowed it there
was just about fifty thousand dollars
in the haul and if rossman dies to-
morrow he will take the secret of that
hiding place with him a wise guy this
rossman nothing like telling where
the jack is for him he just let his pals
know that it was up to them to save
him or else they never would get a cent
of that loot not so dumb eh

  not so dumb echoed courtney

  and fifty grand isnt light money
any time added bannigan so you
can see why they are trying so hard to
spring rossman

  and mused courtney because of
money on one side and personal desire
for vengeance on the other my whole
career is at stake imagine that a
cheap gunman affecting the governor of
the state

  again bannigan laughed loudly
honest bill you make me laugh be-
ing called his excellency and honorable
and all that bunk sure has made a dif-
ference in your slant on such stuff
why you know as well as i do that
this political game just smells with
money deals and personal vengeance
whether youre a governor wanting an-
other term like you or just a city bos
like me doesnt make any difference as
for cheap gunmen you might just as
well have developed into one of them
if it hadnt been for me its a tough
game no matter which way you go any-
way up from the streets sounds
good but i always ask that old one
whenever i hear it you know that old
question about how far is up aint
it the truth bill

  courtney nodded grudgingly he
could not bring himself to say it but
there was a world of truth in what ban-
nigan said he was a sham a bluff
he would bargain and connive and
trade in life or money do anything and
everything in fact which would pro-
mote his personal ambitions the hon-
orable william courtney was a fictive
creature a person of appearances only
underneath he was still plain bill
courtney still a potential gunman just
as bannigan had said

  and youre sure there cant be any
slip-up demanded bannigan sup-
pose you got everything fixed to be fool-
proof

  absolutely answered courtney
im waiting now to hear from whit-
his fast one



ney my secretary he ought to phone
me any minute now that hes on the
scene in the town of gorham

  bannigan whistled with slow sig-
nificance

  whats wrong with that  demanded
courtney

  how long do you think it will be be-
fore some one wises spenser up that
your secretary is in gorham  and how
long do you think it will be before spen-
ser decides that your secretary being in
the same town with the states prison
might have some meaning to-night
a long long while sighed court-
ney whitneys reservation at the ho-
tel there was made for a party named
mcdonald and mcdonald will be a
flashy-looking fellow-all decked out
with jewelry and sporty-looking clothes
lso mcdonald will be all fixed up with
this artificial sun-tan stuff if any one
can recognize my calm quiet easy-going
secretary in that rig it will be a miracle
vlcdonald signs in to-night leaves a
call for half past five to-morrow morn-
ing checks out in the morning and
goes straight to the prison hands
warden lafarge the stay of execution
just at the last possible moment
kinda hard-boiled yet yourself ob-
served bannigan you aint figuring
what a fine night poor rossman is go-
ing to have are you

  rossman answered courtney
doesnt figure hes guilty if ever a
man was

  bannigan nodded in agreement no
denying that but just the same hell
do some tall worrying to-night

  let him said courtney what i
must have is your solemn oath banni-
gan that you wont tell a soul you and
whitney and myself are the only people
in the world who have any idea that
there is to be an eleventh-hour stay
granted rossman not another soul
dare know understand

  bannigan understood there was a
grudging admiration in the nod of as-

sent there was no gainsaying that
william courtney was handling a hair-
trigger situation far better than the
average man would have done long
before this another man would have
definitely broken either with spenser or
bannigan courtney had taken a bet-
ter course too late spenser would
hear of that executive reprieve a few
minutes before seven that stay would
become operative and at seven the
primary voting would begin through-
out the state to-morrow morning
would be too late for allen spenser to
block courtney at the polls

  bannigan glanced at his watch ten
oclock nine more hours until the
time set for the execution of rossman
nine more hours until the polls were
open for the primary election

  down in the village of gorham a
bleak-eyed pallid-faced man put into
words part of the unspoken thought of
bannigan there were two of them in
the little room in the mansion house
on gorhams main street the speaker
lon jerome was clearly dejected he
had a right to be low in his mind so
too did his companion rat fallon
they were mourning the fact of ross-
mans execution mourning however in
a peculiar financial type of reasoning

  nine more hours rat and they
bump off rossman

  rat nodded with more than a trace
of anger and we dont know any-
more about where he stowed the loot
than we ever did the rotten double-
crossing dog gave us a fine break tell-
ing us that the way to get our share was
to spring him out of the death house
here we been using our own jack and
breaking our necks trying to to get him
out of it and the thanks we get is noth-
ing and of all the bum ideas this one
of yours to come up and see him to-day
was the worst

  i notice you came along sneered
lon jerome

  rat fallons tiny jet eyes gleamed at


detective story magazine

that and why not if he was going
to spill any info about where he shoved
that loot i wanted to be in on it too
youre about as trusting as a bank
president sighed jerome

 and why not countered rat
fallon after this fast one that ross-
man pulled on us i aint trusting any-
body and here we are in this hick
town of gorham wasting our time
nine more hours before they give ross-
man the hot seat and it might as well
be nine minutes for all we can do about
it

  theres still a chance that big jack
bannigan can pull something even if
it is only a stay it would give us thirty
days to work on rossman and if he
gets a stay hell have to admit we been
doing our best to spring him

  if he gets a stay if is right big
jack bannigan may be a big shot in
the city but he hasnt got the governor
of the state under his thumb

just the same theres a chance
we got as much chance as a couple
of five hundred to-one shots in the ken-
tucky derby me-im not hoping any
more

  theres always a chance insisted
lon jerome he spoke bravely enough
but the look in his slaty gray eyes be-
lied his words

  yeah snarled rat fallon ive
been sitting here in this cheap dump of
a hotel room waiting for you to come
back and thinking plenty

  thinking

  the jeering tone did not escape rats
attention but he ignored it ive been
thinking that when it comes time for
him to sit down in the chair a yellow
double-crossing hound like rossman is
apt to blab the whole works that
would be nice wouldnt it us right
here in town waiting to get nabbed
suppose he says that it was you and
me that was in on that pay-roll killing
with him

  any other pleasant little thoughts

  yeah i been thinking what a pile
of jack and time weve wasted trying to
get the truth out of him about where
he hid the jack

  little by little rat fallons voice had
risen under the stress of his futile
seething anger you better think in
whispers hissed jerome no telling
whos in the next room in a hotel
the devil take this hotel muttered
rat fallon me-im going back to
the city right away you can hang
around here if you want to but ive
given up hoping maybe you like being
stony broke but not me i got to get
out of this hick prison town and get
to the city and the first shot i get at
easy money im gonna grab it

  listen rat i might as well tell you
rossman told me to-day that if he got
a stay hed come clean about where he
hid the fifty grand

  i should worry answered fallon
theres not much chance of his getting
a stay its in the cards that he gets
the big jolt to-morrow morning at seven
oclock you mean to say that banni-
gan wouldnt let you know if the gov-
ernor had kicked in with a stay of
execution 

  give him time maybe hell phone
any minute

  and more likely he wont noth-
ing doing lon im going to shuffle
along to the station and grab the next
train to the city

  rat fallon had risen and jammed on
his derby at its cockiest angle he
spoke finally from the door see you
in town to-morrow lon

  lon jerome did not answer he was
too deep in the grip of despair for
speech he and rat had tried every-
thing done everything and failed and
now-the conviction was firm upon him
that big jack bannigans trip to see the
governor had likewise failed and to
think that a stay of execution would
have meant that rossman would talk
just a stay of execution once ross-
his fast one



man talked and told the location of the
loot lon jerome did not care how fast
the law finished him rossman was
guilty enough only good luck that
lon jerome and rat fallon had escaped
the same fate rossman had not
squealed at any rate

  rat fallon having decided to leave
the village of gorham wasted no time
about getting down to the station

  next south-bound train is due in
half an hour said the man in the ticket
window north-bound coming in right
now

  whereupon rat fallon purchased a
ticket for the city and ambled out to
the platform half an hour to wait
he watched the north-bound train
slowly coming into the station

  railroad stations were among the
valuable observation points for men of
rat fallons crooked stamp and there-
fore in spite of this being a hick town
he instinctively measured the alighting
passengers who knew when a fellow
might sight fair game for the purposes
of a stick-up artist if so there was
a lot that a fellow could do in half an
hour especially when he considered that
this station was well away from the
brighter part of the town

  the third and last passenger caught
more than a passing glance of interest
from rats close-set eyes he looked
like ready money rats eyes narrowed
still further as he caught the sparkle of
a big diamond ring as the fellow stood
indecisively for a moment he followed
with guarded glance as the man walked
inside the station

  back in the office of the governor the
phone bell was ringing bannigan
watched and listened as courtney spoke
in guarded careful monosyllables into
the receiver after a minute or so
courtney replaced the receiver and
beamingly looked upon big jack ban-
nigan

  that was whitney he just phoned

me from the railroad station at gor-
ham his train was a few minutes late
but hes there now so there is no need
to worry about any slip-ups he said
he would get along up to the hotel and
be on the job bright and early to-mor-
row morning everything is set now for
that eleventh-hour stay of execution
big jack bannigan nodded and a
grudging look of admiration shone in
his eyes this man courtney knew how
to play the game for all there was in
it he pulled out his watch once more
only eight and a half hours till-
till-

  till the polls open concluded gov-
ernor william courtney he said it
with that easy smile which had helped
to carry him so far courtney was
mightily pleased with himself

  it was the feeble gray of dawn out-
side the prison when rossman handed
the chaplain a folded sheet of paper

  after its all over said rossman
you can turn that over to the warden
you see im not the praying kind but
i figure youll see that every one knows
that what the message says there is true
itll tell them where i stowed the loot
from the robbery i told my-my-
the rats that were with me that if they
could get a stay even i would tell them
where the loot was but they didnt
come through so after im-im gone
-you can see that the loot goes to the
people it belongs to

  then you really are guilty
whoever thought i wasnt was
rossmans crisp answer sure im
guilty but no other crooks are going to
get a penny of that loot

  and have you no word of repent-
ance 

  rossman laughed repentance
its just a few years too late for that
chaplain im not going to sing psalms
at the eleventh hour and no use to
remind me about eternity ive seen
eternity looking out of guns at me too


detective story magazine

many times to get weak in the knees
now

  even at the eleventh hour as you
call it said the chaplain it is not too
late to repent

  rossmans only answer was a half
articulate laugh it was his final ges-
ture for the mob on the corner he
must not weaken now he must show
them that rossman had known how to
die

  he must walk when it was time as
nonchalantly as though that grim cor-
ridor outside led to freedom and not
death he must laugh just once again
when they led him to the chair the
mob on the corner must read that ross-
man had died as he had lived-hard-
boiled

  they would read too the real truth
about the loot they would all know
that rossman had kept his word that
he had given back the loot rather than
let his unknown partners share the
wealth which had cost rossman his life

  the thought braced him he could
imagine lon jerome and rat fallon
reading the news he could shut his
eyes and vision up the headlines that
would tell the story condemned re-
veals loot rossman tells where
money was hidden

  so he laughed and then refused to
repent

  that same gray light of daybreak saw
big jack bannigan abroad he must
be out early mustering the votes for
courtney he must see that the early
votes were cast before the word came
of that last-minute reprieve for ross-
man he must do all he could before
allen spenser should turn in futile and
belated rage against courtney

  he wondered just how many hours
would pass before the papers would be
blazoning that surprising story of the
last-minute stay of execution for ross-
man he wondered just how long
thereafter allen spenser would throw
all the weight of his influence against

courtneys renomination it was he
reflected a queer world where a gover-
norship hung in the balance over a man
who was nothing but a cheap and ruth-
less crook

  if that stay gave the crooks lawyers
a chance they might yet save ross-
mans life to think that the governor
would chance that for the votes that
he big jack bannigan controlled it
was enough to make bannigan heave
out his chest and grin broadly as he
started out to the polls he must hurry
and be the first in his district to vote
for william courtney

  promptly at seven oclock big jack
bannigan stepped into the booth to vote
in another district at the same hour
allen spenser did likewise

  promptly at seven oclock on that
same morning the station master at the
village of gorham swung through the
short-cut cross lots back of the station
suddenly he halted some one lay
there in the path groaning

  the man on the ground stared wildly
up at him ive called for help for
hours im nearly paralyzed cant
move

  what happened to you gasped the
railroader

  i must have been slugged-black-
jacked-robbed the mans face was
a picture of agony the time i must
know the time

  seven oclock automatically the
railroader pulled out his watch one
minute after-railroad time what you
need mister is a doctor

  the injured man on the ground had
not answered with a gasping horror-
ridden groan he had lapsed into uncon-
sciousness

  a few hours later extras were being
cried through the city streets here
was a story that was news indeed the
governors messenger had been waylaid
and slugged while bearing the reprieve
papers to warden lafarge rossman
had disclosed the hiding place of the
his fast one



loot and freely admitted his guilt before
he died but for the murderous attack
by some unknown footpad a man who
had already admitted his guilt would
have received the governors reprieve

  here was news indeed for allen
spenser and for big jack bannigan
especially was this news for rat fal-
lon he read and reread the story until
his head fairly buzzed

  in his pocket was the money he had
taken from his victim twenty-one dol-
lars and seventy-five cents the ring
had been junk the diamond not even a
fair imitation he had thrown that
away

  he sadly tossed aside several papers
from his victims pocket suddenly his
own relation to the whole affair dawned
on rat fallon one of those papers had
been the stay of execution in that one
swift impulsive crime rat fallon had
blocked the eleventh-hour reprieve for
rossman he had tossed aside with
those papers the very document which
would have meant that rossman would
live a bit longer and that he would have
told lon jerome and rat fallon where
the loot might be found he had actu-
ally thrown away fifty thousand dollars
aside there in the gloom of that cross-
lots short cut to the gorham station

  to the governors office meanwhile
there had come two very hostile mes-
sages spensers voice had been edged
with malice as it came over the phone

  you were trying to double cross me
courtney im out to beat you now

  big jack bannigans message was to
the same effect so you tried to pull
a fast one had this phony slugging
take place so that the stay couldnt get
through

  to deny to argue to plead-these
things were all in vain courtney knew
better than to try both spenser and
big jack bannigan were against him
the old familiar way of deception and
double dealing which had raised him up
would now hurl him down again

  after a bit he decided to slink away
from the street he could see the great
stone figure of justice atop the build-
ing which he quitted he saw it now
with a new and understanding look
blind justice there were the band-
aged-eyes the balanced scales and the
mighty sword blind justice here-
tofore he had thought of it as a great
unreasoning figure of stone now he
knew it for a symbol of a mighty force
of fate a power that even at the elev-
enth hour could measure out punish-
ment against the transgressor

chinese was greek to him

although the duties of a policeman are many and his qualifications too
numerous to mention there are times when he sadly falls down one of these
times happened to a new york detective the other day he arrested a chinaman
on a charge of possessing policy slips the supposed offender was sixty years old
and president of one of the important chinese societies

    the policy slips were translated in tombs court and read as follows
the dragon will walk the eternal paths of glory and the lion shall be exercised
would that our ancestors bring on to us only fair skies with shining suns when
it was found that the strange characters represented extracts from one thousand
classics of chinese verse the venerable chinaman was released

    the detective who was responsible for the arrest is thinking seriously of
going to night school to study the oriental language so that he will not make a
monkey of himself again

out of a peaceful existence she was lifted
into dangerous adventure

blackmail

s helen riddel opened the
door of her roadster that
bright september afternoon
something indefinite some-
thing which she was never afterward
able to explain or to understand drew
her head around

   the car was standing at the curb
 outside messingers department store
at this time of the day-three oclock--
the wide concrete walk was crowded
with shoppers helen saw the solid
stream of faces saw the gay autumn
frocks of the girls and women which
made them look like brightly colored
flowers in an old-fashioned garden
and then she saw theo bursley

  she hadnt seen him for years and he
had changed decidedly she realized even
in that first glance and not for the bet-
ter his face was deeply tanned his
eyes which for a moment held hers
were narrowed and calculating alto-
gether there was something predatory
and dangerous in the face of this man
whom she had once thought she loved
a shudder ran through her flesh she
slid quickly into the car and next mo-
ment was swinging hurriedly out from
the curb

  she had completed her shopping and
now she drove home and into the two-
car garage adjoining the house five
minutes later she was in her room her
purchases thrown on the day bed her
wide excited eyes studying the face that
looked out at her from her mirror

the chinese tub



  that face had changed too she real-
ized in the days since that early love
affair she had been a girl then and
now she was a woman mere girlish
prettiness had changed to something
fuller richer deeper a look had come
into her eyes-the expression of serene
expectancy which comes to a woman
who loves and is deeply loved in return
she had been happy every day of her
married life not that there werent
little things such as jims unreasoning
jealousy and his preoccupation with
business but she looked upon these de-
tails as really evidence of his love for
her she was the only woman in the
world for him as he often told her and
he didnt want other men looking at her
with that hungry expression he always
read into their glances that made him
jealous and he wanted her to have
everything she had ever dreamed of
having and that made him industrious
she had been very happy she had
come a long ways since she and theo
used to hold hands a vivid flush al-
most of shame swept over her face as
she thought of her agony when he had
gone away to a distant city she could
feel again the hot tears that had flowed
down over her cheeks

  a tap at the door brought her slowly
around she had been so immersed in
those old memories that for an instant
she was unable to place herself bea-
trice one of the maids opened the door
in response to her low-spoken command

  a man to see you mrs riddel

  the girls keen inquisitive eyes were
fastened on her face helen knew that
she must look startled almost fright-
ened

 a man did he give you his
name 

  he didnt give his name but he said
you would be expecting him

  helen turned back toward her dress-
ing table yes she had been expecting
him although she had tried to hide the
truth from herself she knew who the

caller was without asking additional
questions

  tell him i will be down in a few
minutes she said without turning her
head

  by the time she went down the wide
staircase that led into the reception hall
she had partially mastered her excite-
ment her heart was still beating fast
and hard but she felt that her eyes were
steady and that her manner would not
betray her she entered the east room
into which visitors were always shown
and stood for a moment silently apprais-
ing the dark lean face turned upon her
own yes he had changed-terribly
instinctively she seemed to glimpse the
formidable adventures he had passed
through which had brought him to this

  you have a good memory for faces
my dear theo bursley said in a low
purring voice ive changed and you
could hardly have been expecting me
but you knew me in an instant why
did you run away

  helen felt her hard-won self-control
slipping away from her her lips
parted one hand came slowly up toward
her throat then she turned toward
the french windows which opened into
the garden

  come out here if you must talk tc
me she said

  she hardly recognized her own voice
it was thick and unsteady

  he followed her without comment
when they had gone down the steps
into the garden he strode along at her
side they reached a summerhouse
and helen mutely gestured for him to
enter and seat himself

  now what is it you want she de-
manded standing before him

 want my dear helen-

  dont dare call me that i am mrs
riddel

  ah yes so i have learned but
why all the heroics

  why indeed again she fought
valiantly with her fear she was play-

ing her hand very badly after a mo-
ment she sat down some distance from
where he was sitting

  forgive me she murmured you
certainly startled me i thought you
were dead

  it was necessary for you to think
that i was dead-to you i had to
disappear and i did it very completely
as a matter of fact i am a dead man
now theo bursley died and was hur-
ried i am only his ghost

  she was reacting from her excite-
ment she forced herself to relax to
sit quietly back listening to his low
purring voice even that had changed

  yes she said of course i dont
understand

  of course you dont its hardly
necessary i got into trouble-terrible
trouble never mind just what it was
even a ghost can feel fear i had to
make my exit from the drama and
leave you and the others to their own
devices of course i knew you
wouldnt break your heart over me in
spite of those letters you wrote pretty
hot letters mrs riddel i still have
them

  she had known that too those let-
ters-written with all the heat and
ardor of her puppy love innocent
letters but so foolish so easily misun-
derstood 

  you have them she murmured
yes dear lady i have them and
they are for sale

  everything that had lain hidden in
her deeper mind was now openly ex-
pressed she had known in that mo-
ment when she looked into the hungry
threatening eyes of this man out of the
past that he would follow her home
that he had those schoolgirl love letters
of hers and that he would threaten her
with them

  a voice sounded from the direction
of the house

  helen oh helen

  helen riddel was on her feet was

standing in the doorway of the summer-
house speaking tensely over her shoul-
der

  stay here ill come back when i
can

  she flew along the graveled path and
uj the steps jim stood in one of the
open french windows looking smilingly
down

  enjoying the roses he inquired
you might have brought poor old
hubby one

  i was in too much of a hurry when
i heard you calling helen told him
and blushed hotly at the ironic truth of
her statement

  jim was looking strangely at her she
didnt imagine it there was a spark of
suspicion or of uneasiness in his eyes
he slipped an arm round her and led
her back into the east room

  dinner nearly ready he asked-
and now she was sure he was trying to
make his voice sound casual

  come on well see

  she wasnt taking any chances on
leaving him alone he might saunter
out into the garden and her heart gave
a great smothered throb when she
thought of what might happen if he
found theo bursley sitting in the sum-
merhouse it wasnt only that jims
jealousy would suddenlybe quickened
into flaming life he might be in dan-
ger-physical danger-from the ter-
rible creature lurking there

  dinner was ready they sat down in
the pleasant dining room and jim talked
casually of the events of his day helen
always tried to show her interest in
these things to-night it was not diffi-
cult she was immensely interested in
every word her husband uttered in
every glance he gave her the impres-
sion grew upon her that he was uneasy
was watching her

  and then suddenly he spoke

  theres  use hiding my guilty
secret any longer old dear or trying
to hide it youve been watching me
the chinese tub



like a hawk ever since i came home
you knew you little rascal ive got a
committee meeting on for to-night
there i dont know whether we have

anything on or not-

  the grenigers were coming over to
play bridge

  deuce take it i knew there was
something well you call them up
and-

  ill do nothing of the kind you go
to the phone this minute and talk with
mr greniger theres absolutely no
reason why i should always have to
break dates

  jim meekly rose and laid his napkin
aside

  want them to come over and keep
you company he asked looking ridic-
ulously timid and apologetic

  of course not imagine proposing
three-handed bridge to two fanatics like
the grenigers and bridge is all they
ever talk about just get yourself out
the best way you can

  something deep within her listened
and criticized what a hypocrite she
was she was saving herself  and mak-
ing poor old jim think he was to blame
for everything but issues were in-
volved to-night that would brook of no
argument she must save herself-and
him

  jim riddel came back perspiring and
red-faced

  whew  he muttered that wasnt
so hot youd think bridge was the be-
all and the end-all of existence gren-
iger was quite stiff with me well it
cant be helped and im more bothered
about you than about the neighbors
youll have a dull evening dear

  ill manage ive plenty of reading
in the house dont worry

  jim left as soon as he had finished
dinner having cleared up his various
difficulties he set out for his committee
meeting with all the enthusiasm of a
small boy going to a performance of
uncle toms cabin helen waited

five minutes then returned to the sum-
merhouse

  bursley was waiting with an ominous
kind of patience

  get hubby out of the way he said
softly but there was a sneer in the
words for all their velvet quality
well ive waited plenty long enough
i told you that i wanted to sell those
letters of yours youre the logical
buyer

  helen was steadier than she had been
before dinner she stood looking down
at the crouching figure he was like a
great spider huddled there in the
shadow of the rose branches

  to think that i once fancied i loved
you she murmured you call your-
self a man and you try to sell me the
letters i wrote you

  life has kicked me hard and ive
learned to kick back my price is one
thousand dollars cash

  a thousand dollars where would
i get that much money

  thats your concern beg borrow
or steal it if you havent it on hand
the point is you can get the money and
it will be the best investment you can
make you werent anxious to have
friend husband find me here suppose
he learns that i waited while you got
rid of him and then reads these red-
hot letters of yours

  i havent the money

  dont tell me that again i never
was patient as you ought to remember
get the money any way you see it and
bring it to me at this address bring
it in person and dont you dare try any
tricks

  he stood up and approached her
she shrank back for a moment his
hands were on her arms the fingers
gripping down till she wanted to scream
then he had pushed her roughly aside
and was gliding along the garden path

  in her quivering fingers was a scrap
of paper which theo bursley had put
there

chapter ii

donovan makes a promise

there was an address on the scrap
of paper helen riddel saw after
she had hurried to her room and had
locked herself in with her problem her
fear-widened eyes took in the word and
numbers scrawled in pencil but she had
never heard the name of the street it
must be in some remote part of the
city

  what ought she to do her eyes
came slowly up and she saw her own
face reflected in a mirror across the
room if jim were to have come upon
her at this moment nothing she could
have said would have explained the look
of stark horror he would have seen
when she heard him calling her from
the steps leading into the garden earlier
in the evening she ought to have turned
rursley over to her husbands care
that was the natural and common-sense
solution but she had instinctively
avoided it then and now she had come
a long way from anything so simple
and easy every seconds delay after
that logical moment had added tremen-
dously to her difficulties now she was
out of sight of land floating on a chip
with the high seas breaking all about
her

  dim memories of the things she had
written back in those schoolgirl days
came back to her and in an instant her
cheeks were burning jim would never
have understood if he could really
have seen everything as it was could
have put aside his ridiculous jealousy
he would not want her to expose her
heart he wouldnt ask it but on
the other hand it would be infinitely
worse to let theo bursley go to jim
with the letters that wasnt to be
thought of

  one thousand dollars  helen thought
of her diamonds she had quite a col-
lection of them women in trouble and
in need of money pawned their jewels

but helen hadnt the faintest idea how
that was done should she ask jim for
the money to ask such a question
was to answer it he wouldnt be-
grudge her the money but of course
he would want to know what she in-
tended doing with it she quickly came
to the conclusion that there was no way
in the world for her to raise one thou-
sand dollars in cash for any such pur-
pose as she now had before her

  she leaned back in her chair her eyes
closed and suddenly there flashed
upon the curtain of her inner conscious-
ness a face-a rugged honest face
which she had not seen for many
months clyde donovan a college
friend of her dead brothers had been
almost as much at home in helens
home for several years as he had at
his own boarding house clyde appar-
ently had no family of his own when
ed died helen had tearfully promised
herself to look after the young fellow
who had almost broken down at the
grave but after that had come her
marriage-and she had forgotten

  now hastily she stood up she hur-
ried across to a closet and slipped into
an evening cloak for a moment after
she had unlocked the hall door she hesi-
tated should she call clyde and be
sure he was at home  but beatrice and
the other servants would be sure to hear
her talking and observation was one
thing she must avoid so she went
quickly down to the front door and let
herself out

  the evening was fine but that meant
little to the young woman hurrying
along the deserted street she had not
even dared take her car for it might
be noticed and jim might hear of it
her heart throbbed rebelliously when
she realized how involved she was in
this web of lies and evasions once she
paused abruptly a slow flush rising to
her cheeks she ought to go back wait
till her husband returned and tell him
the truth there was nothing in it for
the chinese iub



her to fear only the eager sentimen-
talism of a young girl

  but jim was the last man on earth
to understand and she didnt dare risk
it so she went on and half an hour
later she was ringing the bell of clyde
donovans apartment

  he was waiting for her in his open
door when she stepped from the ele-
vator his face was gaunter than she
remembered it she looked pleadingly
into the steady hazel eyes a lock of
coarse straight black hair hung across
his forehead he swung his head with
a gesture she remembered as well as
if she had seen it yesterday then
he ran his fingers through that black
mane of his and stood aside for her to
enter

  clyde donovan had done well in busi-
ness-partly perhaps because he was
not a very companionable young fellow
and was left much to himself he had
to work hard to keep from being bored
he had few distractions his apart-
ment was well furnished but it showed
at the first glance that it was strictly
a bachelor establishment helen looked
quickly round then again was facing
her dead brothers friend

  you didnt expect to see me she
murmured and could have bitten her
tongue out at the inane remark ive
been meaning to call for a long time
she added and realized she had not
made things any better

  ive seen your name in the paper
once in a while clyde said i read
the society columns just to kind of keep
track of you

  he was smiling-that faithful-till-
death smile she remembered so well in
an instant all the hesitancy was gone
from her heart here was a man with
whom she didnt have to be diplomatic
he expected nothing for himself was
ready to give without promise of re-
turn

  clyde she whispered im in ter-
rible trouble i cant tell jim about it

so ive come to you please sit down
and listen

  he seated himself obediently there
was a little tightening of the strong
mouth a furrow of attention on the
broad forehead

  tell me about it helen he said

  helen told him of seeing bursley on
the street and of his coming to the
house

  i never really cared for him she
explained repeating the old phrase
women from the time of eves daugh-
ters up have used about their discarded
lovers i was a silly young thing and
the time had come when i had to love
something so i created a man and
called him theo bursley i never saw
him as he was although im sure he
wasnt then anything like what he is
now he is terrible i cant make you
understand how terrible he is

  clyde donovan smiled faintly at her
energy

  ive known a few bad eggs he re-
marked now lets get this straight
you wrote him some love letters and
he threatens to take them to mr riddel
unless you pay him a thousand dol-
lars

  yes and they would ruin my life
if jim were to see them you know
clyde they were just the sentimental
ravings of a silly child i actually wrote
poetry to him i called him my sun-
crowned hero imagine poor old jim
reading that hed never feel the same
toward me again

  her companion nodded soberly

  i guess he wouldnt  he agreed
anyhow that isnt the point you
want the letters back or want them de-
stroyed and you want this dog shut
up well i could buy him off and if
i thought hed disappear and never come
back id do it but he wouldnt ive
read the newspapers and i know this
blackmail game theres only one way
to handle a fellow like this-but never
mind the details ill get your letters


detective story magazine

back for you helen and ill see to it
this skunk flies his kite

  helen had always winced at clyde
donovans salty expressions in the old
days but now she found them singularly
comforting she closed her eyes for a
moment then quickly stood up and held
out her hand

  im not going to try to thank you
clyde she said i knew i could
count on you you were the first and
the only person in the world i thought
of appealing to

  im glad of that and just you lay
the thing off your mind its as good
as settled

  she gave him the slip of paper con-
taining theo bursleys address clyde
read and nodded

  hes roosting in the oriental quar-
ter he commented well ill go
down and see him and you can call me
some time to-morrow before nine ill
be here and afterward ill be at the
office good night and dont you dare
to worry	

  she had a final glimpse of his rugged
face and of his broad shoulders as he
stood in the open doorway of his apart-
ment waiting for her to enter the ele-
vator

chapter iii

a visit from the police

deatrice was hovering about near
the front door when helen riddel
reached home the maids inquisitive
eyes looked steadily into those of her
mistress

  mr riddel called a few minutes
ago she said i told him that you
were taking a bath and he said for you
not to worry if he didnt get home be-
fore midnight

  helen frowned hesitated then turned
toward the stairway she began to real-
ize how unfitted she was for a life in-
volving anything but honesty this
girl was not to be trusted but she was
already deeply in the affair concerning

theo bursley she had admitted him
and probably had seen helen take him
out to the summerhouse now she had
taken it upon herself to lie to jim and
helen didnt dare reprimand her for
her presumption

  i hope i did right mrs riddel
beatrice said

  if you thought i was bathing it was
all right to tell mr riddel so the mis-
tress of the house replied without turn-
ing her head

  she went up to her room and by the
time jim came tiptoeing up the stairs
she was apparently asleep but long
after his steady breathing told her that
he had forgotten the cares and the vicis-
situdes of money-making for what re-
mained of the night she lay staring at
the dimly visible ceiling

  she had left clyde donovan with a
feeling of perfect confidence she
vainly fancied for the moment that the
heavy weight of her problem had been
transferred to other and stronger shoul-
ders clyde was capable and direct
and he seemed to know just what he
was going to do but by the time she
lay down to rest a reaction had set in
after all what could clyde do he
had said he wouldnt pay the extortioner
any more and without paying how
could he hope to get the letters  what
had she expected him to do she must
have been temporarily out of her mind
no good could come of the meeting of
these two and very easily evil might
come

  clyde was so confident but he didnt
know the evil creature he was going up
against her brief interviews with
theo bursley had developed in helen
riddels mind a surprising belief in the
evil possibilities of her girlhood lover
perhaps her subconsicous mind had no-
ticed things about him then which it
wouldnt admit but which had been
stored away for future use his selfish-
ness his quick temper his ready resort
to violence at any rate she was sat-

            ds-c
the chinese tub



isfied now without argument that
bursley was capable of murder

  that word came like a wraith into her
thoughts she sat up in bed her hands
groping for the covers she must call
clyde at once and assure herself that
he had gotten safely back to his apart-
ment

  but of course she couldnt to that -
the web was wrapping itself about her
soon she would be unable to turn to
move her lips parted she sat staring
into the soft darkness a sensation of
terror wrapped itself round her she
felt that something unspeakably evil had
drifted into the room-something
ghostly and terrible for a space of
minutes she could hardly keep herself
from screaming

  after that her pounding heart
steadied down and she sank back to
her pillow and lay through the long
hours of darkness listening to the reg-
ularly recurring chimes of the french
clock in the lower hall trying vainly to
sleep as dawn began to drift into
the room she sighed deeply and turned
her head

  she opened her eyes and stared be-
fore her sunshine lay like gold leaf
on the floor and on the coverlet it
must be late jim was gone he had
dressed without her hearing him her
head was heavy however she slid
quickly out of bed

  it was a quarter to nine helen
slipped into a dressing gown and went
into the hall beatrice was dusting

  ill take breakfast in my room
helen said melon toast and coffee

  after the maids footsteps had died
out in the distance she seated herself
at the telephone table and looked up
clyde donovans residence number she
put through the call and sat waiting

  the phone hummed and occasionally
the chatter of voices broke in on her
anxious reverie but at last the prim
voice of central told her that her party
did not answer

 ds-c

  helen felt suddenly cold and fright-
ened he had said he would be at his
apartment till nine-and he wasnt the
kind to deviate from even so indirect a
promise she waited five minutes bea-
trice brought up her breakfast tray and
was sent back to the kitchen for hot
water helen tried again 

  they do not answer central in-
formed her after another time of wait-
ing

  helen made a pretense of eating
breakfast but now she was thoroughly
alarmed and even the thought of food
was repugnant finally she rang for
beatrice and had the tray taken away

  standing in the doorway of her room
helen waited till she heard a door slam
in the direction of the kitchen again
she hurried across to the phone table
she tried to get clydes apartment then
hunted up his office number

  a womans voice promptly answered

  mr donovan hasnt come in yet
she said will you leave a message

  what time does he usually come to
the office in the morning

  he should be here now if youll
leave your number-

  ill call later helen said and hung
up

  she went into her room and crossed
to a window looking through it she
could see the rose garden and the grav-
eled paths and the summerhouse where
she had interviewed bursley her flesh
was hot and cold alternately she tried
to think but the human mind is easily
thrown out of gear by a high voltage of
emotion now all she could see was
quickly shifting images as if she were
looking into a kaleidoscope she saw
jim his face red with amazement and
anger she saw clyde donovan lying
with his eyes half closed the color gone
from his rugged cheeks she saw her-
self stared at whispered about de-
serted

  at ten she called donovans office a
second time he had not yet come in


detective story magazine

the telephone girl said helen waited
till noon and called again he had not
come in

  she called only once during the after-
noon something occurred on that oc-
casion that frightened her away from
the telephone in answer to her ques-
tion the womans voice at the other end
of the line stated that mr donovan had
not been at the office during the day

  youre the lady who has been call-
ing arent you the phone girl con-
tinued would you mind giving me
your name and address we are quite
worried about mr donovan-

  helen hung up abruptly in a flash
she saw it all clyde had confronted
theo bursley and had demanded the
letters there had been a fight and
the man she had so wantonly dragged
into this sordid affair had been killed
now in spite of everything she would
be involved in the case they were sure
to connect her with it sooner or later

  but she couldnt wait for that she
realized the time had come at last
when she must confront the thing that
menaced her without trying to dodge or
twist if clyde had been murdered as
she was certain he had she would not
be able to wait till they dragged her out
she must go to the police and tell her
story

  however the time had not quite come
for that she sent out for afternoon
papers and read them through looking
for any tiny fragment of news that
might have a bearing on the tragedy
there was nothing evening came and
the evening home edition again
there was nothing she had feared head-
lines announcing the discovery of the
murder she found herself pacing the
floor and abruptly sat down

  jim came in soon after six and with-
out preamble to-night announced that
he had another board meeting on

  got to get this thing settled he
said grimly the only time all of us
can get together is at night

  he went on explaining but his wife
hardly heard a word of what he said
she was listening for something-a
sharp step outside the front door the
ringing of the bell she had the feel-
ing that time was closing in about her
and that it would be minutes at the
outside before the earth opened to swal-
low her

  but jim had dressed and had gone
out for the evening before the expected
ring came helen riddel stood up she
heard one of the maids hurrying to the
door then caught the murmur of
voices footsteps sounded coming
swiftly toward the east room

  the door which was ajar swung
fully open and she saw standing for an
instant on the threshold and looking
steadily in at her a tall strongly built
man of fifty or thereabouts he wore
gold-rimmed glasses and was dressed so
that he might have been a doctor or a
lawyer or a banker but she knew that
he was a detective

  he advanced a couple of steps looked
back into the hall and spoke

  we wont need you my girl just
you go to your room and read your
book

  helen heard the girl hurry away the
door closed and again the stranger was
looking down at her

  mrs riddel he inquired i am
inspector forbes of the homicide de-
tail

  in spite of herself a tortured cry es-
caped her lips

  have they found him  is he dead 

  youre the party that called walnut
 several times to-day inspector
forbes continued without heeding her
questions i had the call traced the
last time by then i had got around to
donovans office

  helens thoughts began to clear she
sat looking up at the detective trying to
read his expression it was at the same
time benignant and severe

  now mrs riddel the inspector
the chinese tub



said i think it will be best for you
just to run over your story with me
without wasting any more time you
ask if he has been found and if he is
dead my reply to both questions is
yes now as the serial writers say
lets go on from there although as
a matter of fact weve really got to go
back to the first chapters

  helen sat drooping in her chair she
had known it all the time but this was
a different kind of knowing

  i sent him to his death she said
her voice so low that instinctively the
detective stooped toward her i cant
understand now how i could have been
so selfish or so blind i was in trouble
-i cant tell you about that-but i
went to clyde and he volunteered to
help me he had to confront this crea-
ture when i couldnt get him at his
apartment early this morning i feared
the worst i dont know what to do
inspector forbes listened his head on
one side

  im going to ask you to come with
me he commented no of course
youre not under arrest theres no
reason why you should be is there you
didnt kill him

  oh  no but must i come 
how long will it take

  ill have you back in half an hour
  ill get my cloak

  helen hurried up the stairs three
minutes later she was seated in inspec-
tor forbes car and was being whirled
through the streets

  they penetrated a part of town she
had never seen before and after that
came to a stop in front of a four-story
brick building on the ground floor
was a chinese grocery

  up here-and dont you be afraid
of anything forbes said just keep
hold of my arm

  they went up two flights a police-
man outside a closed door saluted

  all quiet inspector he announced
  inspector forbes nodded and opened

the door he stood aside for his com-
panion to pass helen took a step for-
ward a droplight in the center of the
room was turned on and directly be-
neath it was something

  she cried out in amazement the
sightless eyes leered at her the crooked
mouth seemed to grin dead-unmis-
takably dead-but it was the predatory
face of theo bursley that stared mask-
like up at her

chapter iv

helen explains

through the confusion and horror
that followed her discovery two dis-
tinct thoughts penetrated helen rid-
dels mind the first was that if theo
bursley was dead clyde was probably
alive that brought her a great feeling
of relief the belief that he had been
killed while trying to help her had been
so terrible that her own little problem
was for the time forgotten but clyde
hadnt been killed she didnt try to
work out the logic of this conclusion
she was sure now that he was alive
she drew in a deep breath as she en-
tered the room gently but remorselessly
propelled by the hand of the detective
which rested for a moment on her arm

  but the second thought was of a dif-
ferent charactqr it brought a quick
flush of resentment into her cheeks as
she faced inspector forbes he had
tricked her into telling of clydes visit
here she saw now that forbes state-
ment that he had been found and that
he was dead had referred to bursley
he had let her assume whatever came
most easily into her consciousness and
she had made damaging admissions in
her ignorance

  the man from headquarters seemed
to be reading her thoughts without ef-
i art

  my business young lady he said
is to catch the man who did this mur-
der the fact that he may be a friend


detective story magazine

of yours has nothing to do with it did
you ever see this before

  this was a little brightly lacquered
box with two gay figures painted on
it it was about three and one half
inches square by half an inch deep
helen looked irritably at it

  no i never saw it before she re-
plied and i certainly wouldnt think
of telling you if i had she added with
spirit

  inspector forbes shook his leonine
head

  thats not the way to talk or to
feel said he but in this case it
doesnt happen to make any difference
your friend owned this cigarette case
which fortunately is an unusual one
during the fight last night it fell out
of his pocket it took some of my men
all the morning to find the dealer who
sold it but our troubles were at an end
when we found him he knew mr
donovan personally and gave us his
name and business address it isnt
often we get a break like that at the
beginning of a case

  helen had a new perception of the
complexity of life she saw it as a vast
mechanism where one cogwheel is
meshed to another and where a series
of apparently casual relationships can be
traced by the adept at such things over
a wide span a wooden cigarette case
made in france imported to america
and sold by a neighborhood tobacconist
had brought clyde donovan into the
shadow of the gallows

  how was this-this creature killed
she asked her voice husky

  well first he was beaten up very
thoroughly and then he was stabbed
a clever job under the arm so that
we didnt find the stab wound till the
medical examiner came round and
pointed it out to us

  helen ignored the expression of dis-
taste which for the moment appeared on
her companions face at mention of the
medical examiner one word stood out

before her as if it had been written in
letters of fire

  stabbed she cried clyde never
did that never

  you think not

  i know he didnt i would believe
it of myself sooner than of him
ladies are very handy with knives
and with pistols too inspector forbes
commented give a nice quiet-man-
nered young woman who has never seen
a gat sufficient provocation and let her
get her hand on a gun and shell make
a bulls-eye of the villains heart as sure
as anything but that doesnt prove
your boy friend didnt stab our party
here you see the cards lie kind of
funny you tell me that he came here
to face this egg for your sake murder
has been done many and many a time
for the sake of nowhere near as pretty
a face as yours my dear so we know
he came and weve pretty good evi-
dence that he gave the deceased a ter-
rible beating then he stabbed him
of course he did otherwise why did
he take himself off

  where did he go helen asked un-
steadily

  forbes smiled

  yes thats it-where did he go
and why if he wasnt guilty

  are you sure he wasnt killed  have
you looked for his body

  who would have killed him
theo bursley of course he had
it in his heart to commit murder

  so his name was theo bursley
that isnt what he was called here-
abouts but to get back to your little
conundrum if bursley here had killed
him his body would be lying in this
room or not too far from here wouldnt
it well it isnt the neighborhood has
been gone over with a fine tooth comb
helen could see that he was telling
the truth indeed that idea of clydes
also having been killed in the battle of
he previous night had not been a very
convincing one she stood now look-
the chinese tub



ing shrinkingly down into the leering
face of the dead man

  clyde never stabbed any one she
said again he couldnt have and
besides why would he want to you
say he gave this creature a terrible beat-
ing that would be enough he was
no murderer

  now maam the detective com-
mented i expect weve been round the
mulberry bush enough i can see that
you really believe donovan didnt kill
bursley if thats so i dont want to
waste my time playing on a dead card
but you cant expect me to take your
word for it you know all about the
business and i dont the thing for
you to do is just to lay your cards on
the table like a sensible young woman
dont be afraid to go into details i
know a good deal already this lad on
the floor whose face i dont at all like
had some letters or papers of yours that
he was threatening to make trouble

with youre a married woman-

  and i love my husband and have
never loved any one else helen broke
in fiercely he had some letters i
wrote years ago not wicked letters-
just silly ones

  i know that as well as you do
forbes assured her its the silly let-
ters that make most of the trouble in
this world all love letters ought to be
written in vanishing ink but anyhow
bursley had them and he threatened to
go to mr riddel with them unless you
paid him his price how about a thou-
sand bucks

  he demanded a thousand dollars
helen said

  i thought so you see my dear
ive had a lot of experience with birds
of his feather-what you might call the
vulture tribe hed have come back
for more of course

  that was what clyde said he
thought he could get the letters without
paying anything

  well i fancy he did bursley seems

to have done something of a business
in blackmailing but there was only one
document on the place and that didnt
concern you yes i fancy donovan
cleaned him out after putting him un-
der the table but by that time he was
too mad to be reasonable he went a
step farther and murder is murder

  clyde never stabbed any one he
couldnt have helen riddel sobbed

  then where is he now  why didnt
he call you up  why didnt he show up
at the office to-day

  helens eyes were wide with fright

  i dont know she whispered
where can he have gone

  inspector forbes glanced at his
watch

  just time to get you back inside the
half hour he muttered come ill
take you home you can trust me mrs
riddel i wont haul you into this if i
dont actually have to

chapter v

a hard-boiled lady

porbes returned his unwilling wit-
ness to her home and at once drove
back to the brick building where the
murder had occurred his lips were
pursed his eyes meditative as he went
up the stairs to the death room

  standing against the wall with the
door closed he looked broodingly down
at the body an expression of extreme
dislike appeared in his steely eyes

  killing is a lot too good for you and
your kind my friend he remarked
aloud but there isnt any way made
and provided for in the statutes for get-
ting you out of the way now lets
see

  his glance went slowly and method-
ically around the room it was scantily
furnished and showed unmistakable evi-
dences of the fight that must have pre-
ceded the murder

  this chap donovan certainly gave
him a lacing forbes thought doc


detective story magazine

says one rib is busted and there are
welts all over his body he tried to
fight back but his gun must have been
knocked out of his hand before he had
a chance to use it it was clear back
against the wall under the bed hadnt
been fired-only the dead mans finger
prints on it yes donovan beat him
up and did a thorough job he got
possession of the letters-and then he
stabbed him what with doc says
the death weapon had at least a six-
inch blade stabbed him under the arm
why the deuce did he do that and
why did he take the knife away with
him 

  this case seemed obvious enough but
nothing is more dangerous than an ob-
vious murder inspector forbes had
no intention of following off a smoked
herring and being shown up in court
as a dub and a fool

  this riddel woman is a good clean
type he reflected and im not the
man to brush aside the hunches of such
as her she knew donovan ill have
to go into that a little deeper i expect
but theres nothing crooked about her
ill wager she knew him well enough
to go to him when she needed a friend
and she says he wouldnt have stabbed
anybody its always hard to say what
any given party will or wont do but
a woman will come closer to hitting the
truth than a man any time all right
suppose we say he didnt stab bursley
who did-and when-and why it
was done after the fight how long
after

  one of inspector forbes handicaps
in this case had been the lack of wit-
nesses even indirect ones in the neigh-
borhood no one had been at home
when the battle took place the other
roomers in the old brick building were
a shady lot and he knew he would have
gotten a whisper out of some of them
if they had known anything but the
building had been practically deserted
between nine and eleven the grifters

and the mouchers had been out reaping
their evening harvest

  half a dozen folks could have come
and gone forbes realized suppose
we make another grab into the bag and
see what we can bring out

  he slid his hand into an inside pocket
and produced a letter it was addressed
to miss gwendolin st john hunters
theater the cancellation stamp
showed that it had been posted two
years ago

  exhibit b inspector forbes mut-
tered also found on the floor cov-
ered with a newspaper there isnt any
hunters theater in this town but as
it happens there is a miss gwendolin
st john close at hand and i think ill
just drop in and have a little chat with
her

  as he went out into the hall he
paused to speak to the patrolman on
guard at the door

  theyll be sending up for his nibs
inspector forbes explained but i
want you to stick around for a while
longer just go inside and keep quiet
you might snap off the light if you
feel like it and dont lock the door if
any one comes inside grab him ill
be back in an hour or so

  the call forbes purposed making was
in the neighborhood so he left his car
in front of the brick tenement and
walked briskly along the street his eyes
from force of habit taking in the shop
windows and the faces of pedestrians
at the door of a flat building he paused
to consult his notebook

  no  probably on the third
floor he murmured no elevator
well walk up

  this he promptly did the halls
were dark and odors of cooking per-
vaded the place inspector forbes made
his way quietly upward and eventually
stopped before the door of no 

  for a moment he stood with his ear
against an upper panel shamelessly lis-
tening however his moral turpitude
the chinese tub



went for nothing he stepped back and
knocked

  footsteps sounded at once he heard
a chain rattle and then the door swung
open just far enough to show the face
of a woman of thirty or thereabouts-
a keen suspicious-looking face still
rather pretty in spite of a too liberal
use of paint and powder

  what do you want  she demanded
her voice edged with hostility

  inspector forbes mentally classified
her

  hard-boiled out for the money
but not quite clever enough to get much
trusts no one couldnt understand an
honest man to save her soul

  but his words were pacific enough

  miss st john id like a little talk
with you if you can spare the time im
from police headquarters but dont you
let that worry you just a little routine
matter i thought you might be able to
help me with

  she tried to slam the door in his face
but his foot had been thrust into the
aperture on the other hand inspector
forbes couldnt shove his way in be-
cause of the short strong chain that
had been hooked into place

  for a long moment they faced each
other silently then with a contemptu-
ous shrug miss st john unfastened the
chain and opened the door

  come in she said though im
sure i dont know what you want with
me

  forbes didnt enlighten her at once
he stood with the closed hall door at
his back calmly looking over the room
before him it was gaudily furnished
there was too much gilt and tinsel too
many things that pretended to be one
thing but were another he saw that
even the neat sectional bookcase facing
him was a dummy probably it con-
cealed miss st johns liquor supply or
even an opium layout her narrowed
eyes were fastened on his as he looked
about

  well she said surlily

  im not looking for hooch or dope
the detective assured her just a little
routine matter as ive said in fact
if youll answer one question promptly
and truthfully i wont bother you fur-
ther where were you last night be-
tween nine oclock and eleven quick
lets have it

  but he had to wait at least thirty
seconds before he received his answer

  thats easy  was at the bijou
theater in my dressing room or on the
stage

  not very prompt inspector forbes
commented sure you were there every
minute 

  i certainly was

  thats better now how about
this

  he flashed the envelope before her
eyes unexpectedly she made a leap
forward and all but tore the letter from
his hand

  ah naughty naughty he said
mustnt snatch you were brought up
better than that

  just you come across with my prop-
erty the woman facing him snarled
dont bother with your cheap humor
you cops are a funny lot all right but
i dont feel like laughing at you just
now give me that letter

  you admit that its yours do you
she bit her lip her angry eyes bored
into his

  it has my name on it it certainly
isnt yours she declared

  you never can tell ive got it and
thats something now how would you
like to revise that statement of yours
about where you were last night between
nine and eleven

  i was at the bijou she said sul-
lenly give me that letter

  no im not going to give it to you
i might have traded it for the truth
about your whereabouts

  i told you the truth

  she was almost panting in a vicious


detective story magazine

feline way inspector forbes felt that
his series of verbal darts had accom-
plished its purpose she knew more
than she was willing to tell he was cer-
tain of that but for the present he
would not be able to go further

  all right he said negligently i
just thought id drop in and see what
you had to say

  he turned and laid his hand on the
doorknob over his shoulder he flashed
a last look at the actress her lips were
still parted her eyes were hot and ques-
tioning she seemed about to speak
but next moment she closed her teeth
with a click and pressed her lips firmly

  not yet the detective realized phi-
losophically well ill give her all the
rope she wants

  he went down into a street and
from a corner drug store called head-
quarters two plain-clothes men joined
him five minutes later one of the pair
was the understudy who had located
gwendolin st john for inspector
forbes he knew her by sight

  dont bother her unless she tries to
fly the coop forbes commanded let
her run around all she wants to but
keep tabs on any one she talks to ill
go over to the bijou myself and check
up what she says about last night

chapter vi

under tiie microscope

the case had already gotten into the
footwork stage inspector forbes
realized sooner or later they all did
milling around following up this lead
and that hoping to blunder upon a
flimsy thread of evidence that would
help that was the trouble with murder
kicks in a case of robbery there were
always the stoolies professional
thieves were known to each other and
eventually some one was pretty apt to
rumble but murder unless it was a
professional job wasnt apt to be sim-
plified in this way

  just have to wear out my shoes like
any other roughneck with a strong back
and a weak head forbes thought dis-
contentedly well heres the bijou
lets see what we can dig up about the
lady

  not so much of a lady either he
reflected as he presented himself at the
stage door and accosted the surly-faced
watchman on guard there forbes
hadnt formed any tender attachment
for miss gwendolin st john

  the guardian of the stajje door in-
spected the detectives shield without en-
thusiasm

  yeah  he said and what do you
want 

  you stick around here pretty steady
all evening i suppose forbes asked

  if i didnt the show would bust up
theres forty young johnnies a night
on the average that trv to crash this
door

  well that ties you down from the
time the show-opens till it closes youre
right here the iron-faced boy that keeps
the show going no one gets in with-
out your approval but any one can get
out that wants to of course the actors
and actresses-

  the men can go out when they want
to his informant interrupted the
girls cant go out till their act is over
for the night

  why not

  orders of the management one of
them went out one night and didnt
come back-eloped or got soused and
besides we aint going to have our girls
standing around on street corners be-
tween acts talking with fellows some
of them will do it if they get a chance

  yes i expect they would so when
a girl comes on in the evening shes
here till she goes off-at what time

  that depends on the evening
wednesdays and sundays we give a late
show that keeps them here till about
midnight

  inspector forbes reflected that as to-
the chinese tub



day was thursday miss st johns alibi
for the previous evening was pretty con-
vincing he didnt want to mention
her by name if he didnt have to this
guardian of the honor of the stage
looked as if he might wag a wicked
tongue when it came to the pastime of
gossip

  but there was another possibility
the previous evening had been warm
and he noted that the watchmans chair
to-night had been close to the end of
his little lane-within two feet of the
sidewalk forbes turned and stared re-
flectively in the opposite direction
mostly darkness there he could check
up on that detail presently

  no one sick or otherwise absent last
night he asked

  sickness aint no excuse sick or
well they got to report if a girl is
dead thats different

  also orders of the management i
suppose the inspector murmured so
they were all here last night

  yes they was

  well im glad to hear it a group
of girls came hurrying toward the stage
door from the street forbes moved
silently in the opposite direction-into
the shadow end of the narrow lane that
flanked the theater building see you
later he added

  he had to grope his way through the
darkness but after stumbling a hun-
dred feet or so along a narrow concrete
walk he came out into an alley a
grim smile twisted his lips all the st
john woman had to do was to watch
her chance and slip out behind the
watchmans back by turning to the
left rather than to the right she would
not have to encounter his formidable
glare

  the alley led into the side street in-
spector forbes consulted his watch then
went briskly forward in less than five
minutes he arrived in front of the brick
building where the murder had taken
place yes she would have had no

difficulty in getting here and getting
back between acts

  forbes went up two flights of stairs
and entered the unlighted room where
he had left the policeman on guard the
solitary officer reported that nothing had
happened there had been no visitors al-
though he had heard the other roomers
passing along the hall

  more footwork this time only fig-
urative inspector forbes went down
to his car and drove to the headquar-
ters building in his little office he
found a memorandum left by the plain-
clothes man who had been sent out to
gather the facts on the dead mans pre-
vious activities there was quite a lit-
tle docket

  theo bursley had been known as
marx he had been in the city nearly
two months but there was no evidence
that he had been up to anything out of
the way until recently about two
weeks ago a patrolman in the lower part
of the city had brought him in together
with a well-dressed young man obvi-
ously both scared and excited they
had been arguing loudly had been ap-
parently on the point of fighting marx
had refused to talk his companion
had demanded that his attorney be
called and a well-known family lawyer
had come to the station and managed
to get the thing hushed up now both
the attorney and his client were out of
town for an indefinite time

  blaekmail and they wont do a thing
to help us forbes realized a nice
case all the way around

  blackmail cases were usually like that
the only victims of extortion who ever
fought back were hard-headed middle-
aged business men who knew better
than to yield to the first demand and
usually they were made to look so fool-
ish and despicable before the thing died
out in the newspapers that all the other
victims were scared into submission

  its no good inspector forbes told
himself im getting old and i never


detective story magazine

was very bright i wouldnt have been
a detective if i had had any brains
just a roughneck policeman no educa-
tion no friends nothing i ought to go
and hop into the bay

  but at this moment the office door
opened and a debonair-looking young
man with his featherweight felt hat a
trifle on one side and an airy whistle on
his lips came into the room forbes
began to glower this medical exam-
iner always set his teeth on edge

  so here you are he growled in-
hospitably well dont spring any of
your stuff because i wont stand it see 
i dont know anything about detecting
and im not supposed to im a fool
but theres one thing im not the only
one around here i havent got a big
microscope and a lot of bottles and glass
tubing strung all over the place i dont
know human blood from red ink or
raspberry juice and at that i know
as much as the medical examiner why
dont you go over to france or to ger-
many or to england and learn how to
examine evidence those babies over
there can take a hair and tell you all
about the man that shed it or they can
take a spoonful of lint and dust off a
mans coat and tell you where hes been
and what hes done youre a big help
you are

  young doctor alex giddings con-
tinued to go through the motions of
whistling but no sound issued from his
puckered lips his eyes widened slightly
and he seemed overcome by amazement

  inspector he asked in a hushed
voice are you a mind reader

  go on spring it forbes grunted
well if youre not old man coin-
cidence has some explaining to do do
you know what i came in here for 

  i dont know why you ever come in
here forbes said unkindly i could
get along without you

  dont say that youll regret it in
a minute you said i ought to go to
europe to learn how to use a micro-

scope in criminology well i didnt
go there but i did spend my last vaca-
tion with a man out in california-a
policeman who knows his business
they call him the scientific cop and
let me tell you he doesnt have to go to
paris or to berlin to ask how to handle
his end of things

  ive heard of him forbes admitted
but whats that got to do with me
kind of self-centered to-night arent
you  the young medical man suggested
however i dont blame you but
just you come over to my place and ill
show you something

  in spite of himself inspector forbes
was impressed this irritating young
fellow had always had a suggestion of
competence about him and now he
seemed more in earnest than forbes had
even known him to be the inspector
stood up locked his desk and followed
out into the hall and around to the al-
ley door soon they were passing
through the hallway that led past the
morgue and into the offices at the rear

  doctor giddings unlocked a door and
motioned for his companion to enter
the room beyond was brightly lighted
a bench ran around three walls and on
this bench were all the paraphernalia
forbes had so slightingly mentioned-
microscopes cameras flasks beakers
condensers the medical expert crossed
to one of the microscopes stooped over
it for a moment and then with a rather
theatrical gesture straightened up

  have a look at that he com-
manded i took it out from under the
dead mans finger nails

chapter vii

jim demands an answer

xn her return home after her visit
with inspector forbes helen rid-
dels first feeling was one of infinite re-
lief clyde was not dead bursley
was for a short time these two facts
seemed all that mattered
the chinese tub



  but the inevitable mental reaction set
in long before jim had returned from
his committee meeting she had begun
to worry why had clyde disappeared 
was it possible that he had actually
killed bursley-with a dagger or knife
at first she was firmly convinced that
this was out of the question clyde
donovan was the last man in the world
to resort to anything so un-american
he would use his fists or in a dire
emergency even a revolver if one was
at hand but he would never stab any
one

  the more she thought about the mat-
ter however the more confused and un-
certain she became bursley might have
drawn the knife-it would have been
in keeping with his character she felt-
and clyde might have wrested it from
him and struck the fatal blow then he
had run for it but that also was out
of character and she felt herself more
and more baffled there was just one
possibility which was in keeping with
what she knew of the rather rugged-
minded young fellow who had been her
brothers friend clyde must have been
desperately wounded or perhaps he had
been killed outright but in that case
where was his body

  there is nothing more wearing and
nerve-shattering that continued silence
in a case of this kind jim returned
preoccupied by the events of his eve-
ning helen continued to think over
and over again the little round of
baffling thoughts clyde hadnt done it
or had he  he had run away or per-
haps he had been killed she reached
a point where she would gladly have
dismissed the whole terrible affair from
her mind but by this time she had lost
control of her image-forming ma-
chinery vivid and terrible pictures pre-
sented themselves in swift and con-
tinuous succession

  it was at breakfast time next morn-
ing that she first became aware of a
change in her husbands manner toward

her jim was very quiet but his eyes
from time to time sought her face she
met one of those lingering glances and
suddenly her heart missed a beat what
did that expression mean there was
something sultry and unpleasant in it
she sat looking steadily at jim he
smiled and resumed his eating but his
smile wasnt a pleasant one and he ut-
tered not a word to explain it

  here was a change of thought at any
rate helen suddenly began to ask her-
self if jim could suspect anything sup-
pose he hadnt been at a board meeting
last night suppose he had been watch-
ing her but he had come home in his
usual after-business mood no he had
been all right till now helen stole a
glance at him from the corners of her
eyes he was stealthily regarding her

  whats the trouble dear she
asked her voice cool and pleasant in
spite of her disturbance

  nothing

  he was certainly angry or suspicious
about something she tried to think of
possible explanation other than the log-
ical one she could think of nothing

  but jim was not going to explain
he maintained a sulky silence through-
out the remainder of the meal and went
off to his office without another word
he didnt kiss her good-by and that
was final proof if she had needed any

  throughout the day she kept to her
rooms she left a door partly open so
that she could hear the telephone oc-
casionally it rang and she hurried to an-
swer it before one of the maids could
do so various acquaintances called
helen each time excused herself on the
plea of having a headache she both
hoped and feared that inspector forbes
might call her but no word came from
the police

  by afternoon her headache was a very
real affair she felt sick and dizzy
aspirin didnt help so she sat by the
window and looked wearily out over
the lawn a robin family consisting


detective story magazine

apparently of two harried parents two
overgrown and very greedy children
with spotted breasts and a bachelor
uncle helped her center her attention on
something outside her swirling anx-
ieties the bachelor uncle evidently dis-
approved of the way in which the
younger generation was being brought
up on one occasion he hopped up be-
hind one of the gobbling children and
unperceived by either parent appropri-
ated a fat angle worm which had a mo-
ment before been thrust into a gaping
pink mouth then he administered his
idea of a peck and turned his back
helen smiled wanly

  the robins flew away and long shad-
ows began to form across the close-
clipped turf evening was at hand she
felt all of a sudden that she couldnt
stand another moment of this silent
mocking house she must get out or
she would smother she went quickly
down into the hall and let herself out

  a half-hour walk immensely re-
freshed her she came slowly back
along the quiet evening street as she
went up the steps of her own house the
front door swung open before her and
jim riddel stood looking out and down
his lips parted and quivering a pasty-
green shadow tinging his usually ruddy
cheeks

  come in here he said i want
to talk to you 

  helen paused then came up the re-
maining steps and entered the house
jim slammed the door

  this way he said his voice trem-
bling

  he went before her into the east
room as helen crossed the threshold
jim again closed the door this time
shutting them both into the room over-
looking the garden for a moment she
thought they were alone but next mo-
ment she saw the maid beatrice stand-
ing meekly in a corner

  i want the truth about this business
out of you jim said

  he had switched on a light and by
it she saw that he really was green-or
yellow certainly there was a tinge of
color in his face he had never seen there
before for an instant she was so in-
terested in this phenomenon that she
hardly heard his question-or state-
ment

  actually his teeth were chattering
he stared at her his eves wide and un-
natural

  will you talk he snarled

  offhand helen riddel would have
said that such a situation at this would
have frightened her confronted by it
however she unexpectedly found her-
self tingling with anger

  are you sick jim she asked if
you are ill overlook what youve said

  overlook it

  he began to laugh his voice was
metallic and high-pitched in a woman
the seizure would have been called hys-
terics

  stop it helen commanded stamp-
ing her foot what is beatrice doing
here 

  beatrice looked slyly at her mistress
and then at jim riddel

  i think i ought to go she mur-
mured her voice as soft as a spring
breeze

  not much you wont not till
youve told my wife what you told me
if youve lied ill strangle you go
ahead spill it out

  ask mrs riddel if ive lied the
maid said quietly ask her about the
man who came here night before last
she talked with him for a moment in
this room and then she took him out
when you came home he was there
when you came home he was there
while you ate dinner and after youd
gone out for the evening mrs riddel
went out to him again

  jim made a fizzling noise as if he
had drunk too much lemon soda helen
looked at him with arched brows then
she turned back to beatrice
the chinese tub



  go on she commanded coldly
finish your story

  yes finish it jim grated i see
its all true

  mrs riddel went out to the sum-
merhouse as soon as she was sure you
wouldnt come back she wasnt there
long the second time but she just came
back to the house long enough to get
her coat and hat when you called
she was still away i lied to you sir
and my consicence has been bothering
me ever since

  helen smiled the little trouble
maker beatrice was having the time
of her life but save for minor inac-
curacies which were not worth calling
attention to her story was correct and
it did make things look bad poor jim

  however a woman even a very nice
one can say poor jim and proceed
to carve jims heart out and hold it
palpitating before his face helen was
enraged but her anger took a different
form from her husbands it made her
cold as one of those frosted pipes in
a butchers window her voice was low
and steady

  you poor child she said smiling
at beatrice how you must have suf-
fered 

  i tried to do what was right but i
shouldnt have lied the girl murmured
stealing a look of malicious triumph at
her mistress when that gentleman

called for you last night-

  last night-again jim shrieked
you didnt tell me that

  you didnt give me a change sir
you got in such a passion i couldnt
make myself heard

  what a delightful tete-a-tete you
two must have had helen observed
where did it take place-in the
kitchen i should imagine that would
be the proper setting

  never mind where it took place
what have you got to say about it
jim panted come im waiting
dont let me hinder you his wife

said with an acid sweetness that made
his lips twitch keep right on waiting
jim if you fancy im going to take
part in any such sordid affair as this
you certainly have gone crazy

  she felt as cool and collected as she
had ever felt in her life she walked
past her husband who was standing
with his feet braced apart near the
door and without another word went
into the hall and along toward the front
of the house she opened the street
door stood for a moment looking into
the darkness and then went down the
steps to the walk

  of course that kind of calm couldnt
last she suddenly found herself cry-
ing she drew out her handkerchief
and dabbed at her tears what should
she do what could she do if she
had only told jim in the first place

everything would have been- but

it wouldnt everything would have
been all wrong just as it was now

  of course jims mind was thoroughly
poisoned and he was burning up with
jealousy and the rage it kindled but
he would have been unreasonable and
impossible even if she had taken him
into her confidence right to begin with
and her conscience told her that she
had done nothing wrong from begin-
ning to end in all this wild crazy series
of misadventures she was simply
caught in the wheels of a great stupid
machine and was being torn to bits

  a lethargy of despair succeeded the
tears and turmoil stage she walked
on and on not realizing the direction
her feet were taking her until suddenly
she saw in the obscurity of an alley she
was passing a twisted evil face she
stared back startled and frightened
then she was hurrying on but now she
was vividly aware of her surroundings
she was in a street occupied by cheap
lestaurants cheap clothing stores the
doors of which were still open for busi-
ness and pawnbroking establishments
furtive steps came on behind her she

passed villainous-looking men many of
them orientals her lips parted and
she looked wildly about for a cab

  as she reached the corner she saw
before her on the farther side of the
street a brick building her mind
seemed to swing round and adjust itself
she knew now where she was fear
and abhorrence which are as strong at-
tractive forces as are hope and approval
had drawn her back to the neighbor-
hood of the murder it was over there
in one of those mysterious upper rooms
that theo bursley had been killed she
paused her eyes swinging up and
then she started and cried out for a
hand had been laid  her arm

  you shouldnt come here alone
maam inspector forbes said with ob-
vious disapproval were you looking
for me

 no-yes-i dont know why i
came helen whispered tears again
welled into her eyes i just had a ter-
rible scene with my husband she
added impelled by something strong and
dependable in the face of this police
officer to tell her troubles

  he doesnt know anything about
this business forbes inquired

  well jim is so unreasonably jeal-
ous he knows when hes in his right
mind that i love him and him only
but if any little thing he doesnt under-
stand happens he seems to go crazy
the maid talked

  maids always do so you had a
scene with hubby and decided to make
things better by walking alone down
below the dead line its lucky i came
along just when i did ill take you
home and you stick there till you hear
from me as for jim ill look into his
case i dont promise you anything
mind but i rather hope to be able to
put a bee in his bonnet

  in pretty much of a daze by this
time helen riddel allowed herself to
be assisted into the inspectors car and
driven home jim was nowhere about

when she entered the lower hall she
went to her room the house was si-
lent she was apparently quite alone in
itr

  she locked her door undressed
quickly and went to bed

chapter viii

the tub

drevious to his accidental meeting
with helen riddel inspector
forbes had spent a busy day the peek
which the medical examiner had given
him through the microscope had set him
on a new track but at the same time
he had to keep tabs on all the leads he
had uncovered before for one thing
he wanted to lay hands on clyde dono-
van and that silly young fool had
taken himself off so completely that
forbes couldnt get so much as a whis-
per from the undertow respecting him
or his whereabouts

  if he didnt kill marx or bursley
what is he hiding out on us for the
detective asked himself discontentedly

and if he did kill him-

  well in that case young doctor gid-
dings had better go back to berkeley
and take another summer course in
criminology

  the trouble with that lad is that he
puts all the real work on me forbes
thought he says look at this and
after youve jooked at it go out and pick
up your man well thats what i get
paid for

  during that eventful day inspector
forbes hired himself an assistant one
of his difficulties lay in the fact that the
quarter below the dead line was largely
occupied by orientals and other for-
eigners forbes was no linguist to
assist him in threshing his carload of
straw he chose a yellow-faced youth
very chinese in general appearance and
features decidedly american in dress
and appurtenances his clothing was
modish and he carried in his vest pocket
the chinese tub



more fountain pens and pencils of pat-
ent makes than inspector forbes had
ever heard of

  the detective decided on this assist-
ant late in the afternoon he had had
several others in view but had dis-
missed them after a short trial he and
charley hin the successful appointee
talked for a time in a basement restau-
rant yes charley had known this man
marx so had the others did he
know anything in particular about him
anything for instance that would ac-
count for his murder the almond-
shaped eyes looked cryptically into those
of inspector forbes

  a death by violence is in the stars
and in the palm of the hand he said
in his low resonant voice when the
soul of a man who is to die by the knife
is born into this world the ghosts of his
ancestors bow their heads-for they
know that already the hour and the mo-
ment are appointed

now thats nice and helpful forbes
muttered but what does it mean
the words of the wise are not to be
interpreted by fools his companion
serenely said

  oh yes present company of
course excepted all right suppose you
come up and take a look round the
rooms we might see something to-
gether that ive missed

  he led the way out of the basement
and along the street two flights up
and inspector forbes drew a key from
his pocket and fitted it into the lock
the policeman had been sent back to
his former station

  nothing inside the death room had
been changed save for the disappear-
ance of the body inspector forbes
steady eyes rested on the face of char-
ley hin the chinaman looked impas-
sively round the room then produced a
cigarette tapped it on his polished nail
and lighted it

  see anything suggestive forbes
asked

  a grain of sand and a drop of water
suggest the universe he was told

  inspector forbes had begun to flush
a spark came into his eyes

  he said nothing however but stood
for a time again looking over the room
after that he led the way across to a
door at the rear opened it and stepped
into a lean-to shed connecting with
some rickety back stairs this door had
been double bolted on the inner side at
the time the body was found but to-day
forbes had begun to take a particular
interest in what lay beyond it there
was a narrow shelf against one wall it
was littered with broken dishes and with
empty tin cans which had once held
food the floor was dirty and also was
littered with apparently insignificant
odds and ends but in one corner was
a chinese tub which had evidently been
placed there to catch the drip from a
hole in the roof

  now the man from headquarters
stood looking down into this water-filled
container something glimmered at the
bottom of the water

  come in here charley he said
speaking over his shoulder

  the chinaman without a sound was
at his elbow

  what do you make of that forbes
demanded pointing to the glimmering
object

  there was no reply other than a
faint shrug

  oh so thats what you think the
detective commented well just get
it out for me will you

  charley hin without a word thrust
his hand down into the tub and brought
out a small circular piece of tin his
sleeve was dripping as he handed it to
forbes and there was a faint mocking
smile about his slanting eyes

  inspector forbes stood staring down
at the little tin disk in his hand

  ah charley charley he said
softly a little grain of sand and a
little drop of water-and my little tin

wheel cut from the top of a salmon can
come we have finished here

  they went out through the death
room inspector forbes closed and
locked the door

  im going down to headquarters he
commented i want you to stick
around and use your eyes and ears re-
port to me to-night-same place i picked
you up before have you any ques-
tions you want to ask

  the fool asks the sage sees char-
ley hin replied

  which means no all right to-
night at eight

  inspector forbes went directly to the
headquarters building where he sum-
moned into his little office an astute-
looking young man who often did the
society end of difficult cases

  heres a name and address forbes
explained handing the plain-clothes man
a slip of paper i want you to look
up this guy riddel and see what you
can get on him i want a twitch on his
nose i want him fixed so hell be easy
to handle hes kicking up a row in
this marx murder kick and ive got to
throw a chill into him some way hes
one of these insanely jealous johnnies
and pretty generally youll discover they
arent quite on the level themselves just
dig around a bit and see if hes been
up to anything he wouldnt like the
world to know about

  a varied and sundry day it was in-
spector forbes reflected when he was
again left alone everything from tin
disks to unofficial blackmail-forcing an
unruly husband to get back into line
he shouldnt wonder if huffner would
get something on this guy riddel he
shouldnt wonder but that was only a
small detail and the others werent go-
ing so well it was time for him to
pull his big scene if he could pull it
to-night he would have the thing all
settled up in no time he had most of
the factors in his hand but still he
wasnt ready to go to bat one item

  more-the whereabouts of clyde dono-
van where had the idiot taken him-
self to for a moment forbes had an
uneasy feeling suppose that donovan
also had been murdered

  but he didnt think so and in any
case that wasnt a proviso he could act
on it was not for him to question
why but to keep plugging along hop-
ing for the best

  late that night the two detectives he
had set to watch gwendolin st john
came to headquarters in a taxicab bring-
ing the actress with them

  she tried to run for it inspector
the elder of the pair explained we
let her go as far as the railroad station
then tagged her and brought her in

  correct forbes replied he stared
through steely eyes at the flushed and
angry woman so you were headed
for out were you he added

  ill make you pay for this she said
giving him look for look ill make
you wish that youd never heard of
me

  if i were to believe every party that
tells me that id figure i ought to have
been born deaf the inspector assured
her are you ready to talk

  ive told you all that i know

  lock her up forbes said turning
on his heel if she raises a holler
about a lawyer book her as an acces-
sory before the fact in the marx mur-
der

  that shook her he saw as he darted
a last look at her but she wasnt ready
to come clean yet let her think it over
a while in her cell he wasnt quite
ready for her story anyhow he knew
about what it would be when she told
all of it

  the great building quieted down and
the sound of traffic from the avenue in
front became but a subdued murmur
forbes stifled a yawn and consulted his
watch

  nearly midnight and he had slept
but little the night before and the night

            ds-c

i
the chinese tub



before that if only that fellow dono-
van could be picked up

   rut at last he went into the property
clerks office where there was an army
cot and a blanket inspector forbes lay
down in all of his clothing except his
hat he fell asleep hoping to hear his
name called to learn that the missing
link in his chain of evidence had been
found but now the headquarters build-
ing was as silent as a cemetery at mid-
night

chapter ix

an arrest

porbes was up at dawn and had
breakfasted at the all-night restau-
rant across from the station then un-
til time for the day shift to come on
he talked with the night captain and
with the burly corporal in charge of the
switchboard

  huffner the detective forbes had
sent out to investigate jim riddels rec-
ord came in early with a crafty satis-
fied look on his face

  i got him inspector he said if
friend wife knows what hes been up
to these last few evenings i miss my
guess

  not another dame inspector
forbes asked

   well yes and no you see this bird
riddel is on an entertainment commit-
tee for the wholesale mens clothing
merchants and theyve been getting a
show ready for the out-of-town buyers
who are due to-morrow night that is
the show is billed for them and its a
snappy revue take it from me

  huffner went into details forbes
listened and nodded

  that ought to be about right he
commented ill just drop in and have
a talk with our friend

  he found jim riddel already seated
at his desk plowing through a stack of
letters to which he was dictating replies
the man from headquarters came into
the private office with a slow and im-
ds-c

pressive step his formidable gaze
transfixed the business man

  riddel hastily dismissed his stenog-
rapher

  what is it officer he demanded
after forbes had shown his shield

  why mister its about an entertain-
ment you commercial gents have been
rehearsing-behind locked doors-for
the last few evenings a report has
been turned in on it something about a
young woman who does a dance on the
table and afterward passes around
something that isnt sweet cider to the
guests you remember that theatrical
gent that spent some time down at at-
lanta for putting on the wrong kind of
a dinner

  jims eyes bulged he sat slumped
back in his chair staring glassily at his
visitor he had begun to perspire

  for heavens sake officer isnt
there some way this thing can be hushed
up he inquired his voice raised hardly
above a whisper if my wife was to

hear of it-

  oh youre a married man are you
well that doesnt make it any better
you ought to be ashamed skipping
around down there and trying to ogle
this toe dancer hush it up what do
you mean hush it up are you try-
ing to bribe me 

  he looked so fiercely at jim riddel
that the latter for a moment turned his
harried eyes aside

  really officer jim muttered i
dont know what to do i didnt see
any harm in the thing these buyers
are all out-of-town men and they ex-
pect us to put on something snappy for
their entertainment i take the full re-
sponsibility for this feature you object
to theres nothing wrong about it as
far as im concerned i assure you ive
hardly spoken to the young lady
hardly spoken to her

  well i had to explain to her what
we wanted

  you explained about the costume


detective story magazine

and the stuff on the table i suppose
what does your wife think of it all
doesnt she object

  jim mopped his face on his handker-
chief

  i dont trouble my wife about busi-
ness affairs he explained she
wouldnt be interested

  well i guess ill go around and talk
with her about it women have a kind
of intuition in these kind of things and
if she gives you a clean bill of health
ill be inclined to drop it

  inspector forbes knew that he was
running close to the wind of course
these old coots were putting on a show
that would undoubtedly shock sensitive-
minded elderly people but there was
nothing intrinsically wrong with it if
he pushed the thing too far he was apt
to be called up before the chief to ex-
plain well then he must substitute
suggestion and innuendo for harsher
methods

  jim riddel said

  id rather you didnt bother my wife
with this officer id rather she didnt
know anything about it

  ill think it over inspector forbes
replied i ought to talk with her but
ill see what can be done just keep
this under your hat and ill do my best
for you

  and there was another detail out of
the way he mused as he went down
into the street and climbed into his car
jim would be in a condition of uncer-
tainty he wouldnt know whether or
not helen had been informed of his re-
cent activities as an entertainer

  with that bee buzzing around in his
bonnet he wont have much spunk left
to chevy mrs riddel the detective de-
cided i dont think he will make any
more bother

  inspector forbes returned to his office
and gloomily read the notes on his desk
he listened to the reports of some of
the men who had been sent out to pick
up clyde donovan nothing had been

heard of the fugitive apparently he
had left the city

  forbes took up the search in person
that day in company with charley hin
he visited every obscure lodging bouse
in the quarter below the dead line

  from time to time the two men
looked cryptically at each other

  you think i wont catch him
forbes demanded

  when the sage pursues he sits with
his eyes closed the chinaman replied

  for an instant there was almost a
sneer about his thin lips

  meaning he uses his head instead of
his feet  the inspector said softly
and you think im not smart enough
to do that charley hin do you re-
member the tub and the water and the
little tin disk

  the pupils of forbes steely eyes con-
tracted for an instant to pin points he
stared down at the man at his side
then they were walking on down a
street faced by chinese houses with
carved red-and-gilt balconies

  but donovan had apparently stepped
off the earth into the fourth dimension
forbes called headquarters from time to
time but nothing had been heard of the
missing man there and so the day
passed and evening again was descend-
ing over the city the two men so
oddly paired had eaten and drunk to-
gether they spoke but little but some-
thing-an unspoken but mutually under-
stood tie-held them with their shoul-
ders almost touching

  as dusk thickened into darkness in-
spector forbes paused and stood think-
ing

  hin my friend he said after a time
of frowning consideration i have a
feeling that some folks would call a
hunch to-night i believe were close
to the end of our search come what
is it the frenchmen say look for the
dame let us look up the woman in
the case into the car with you

  in the police car they drove across
the chinese tub



the city forbes parked beside a church
and climbed out

  come he said again

  the riddel house was around the cor-
ner but as they were quietly approach-
ing it inspector forbes suddenly saw a
figure slide from one clump of shrub-
bery over at the right to another some
one was approaching the side window
looking upon the lawn

  come he said for the third time
but now he spoke through his teeth
after him hin

   the race perhaps is not always to the
swift but on the present occasion in-
spector forbes long legs were a decid-
ing factor he was good for a sprint
he knew but his wind wouldnt hold out
for any marathon so he put his heart
into the matter and in less than thirty
seconds after he had spotted that mys-
terious figure slipping from bush to
bush he had collared it forbes was
puffing but he held his prisoner by the
shoulder and slid his free hand to his
gun

  its quite all right officer the
black-haired rugged-faced man before
him said no need for that ill come
along peaceably

  your name is donovan

  im clyde donovan i was coming
in after i talked with mrs-after i got
through with one little detail-to give
myself up

  you took your time about it the
man from headquarters grumbled but
i have you now do you want to see
my warrant

  no need for that the younger man
said quietly again im willing to come
with you

chapter x

forbes explains

cive people sat in the room in which
theo bursley had been murdered
and a sixth stood with his broad shoul-
ders against the door leading into the
hall charley hins chair was placed

against the other door the one leading
into the little lean-to porch connecting
with the back stairs

  dont let any one out there char-
ley inspector forbes said his hand
groped at his back yes the hall door
was bolted and now miss gwendolin
st john or whatever your name really
is were ready to listen to you the de-
tective added

  gwendolin st john sat in a corner
at her left was helen riddel at her
right the jaunty-looking young medical
examiner now she raised her sullen
eyes and stared at forbes

  what do you want me to say she
demanded

  the truth that yarn of yours
about having been at the bijou all eve-
ning wont wash you know you
sneaked out the stage door when the
watchman was sitting near the street
and you went out by way of the alley
you came straight over here it took
you less than five minutes for you were
in a hurry you came up here now
you tell it

  the actress lips were twitching and
there was an unhealthy pallor upon her
cheeks forbes stood studying her
she wouldnt hold out

  if i tell the truth will you let me
go-to-night she demanded her voice
low and unsteady

  tell your story and well see ill
do my best for you if you dont come
clean ill hold you for the grand jury
that may sew you up for weeks or
even months

  she shivered as with actual cold for
an instant her eyes shifted to the rear
door guarded by the seated chinaman

  all right she said but if you
think i killed marx youre crazy why
should i 

  he was handling a blackmail job for
you  he was what might be called your
agent 

  she hesitated then nodded clyde
donovan seated across the room stared


detective story magazine

 and slid to the edge of his chair he
 seemed about to break in but a warn-
 ing glance from forbes checked him

   if you want to put it that way
 miss st john muttered id tried to
 get a little money out of this young
 fool but i couldnt quite get him to
 come through he was scared but his
 family keep him on short allowance
 marx said he could make him pay if
 he had to steal the money i had to have
 it

  for dope inspector forbes
 thought but what he said was all
 right what did you come up here
 for 

   i hadnt heard from marx for some
 time naturally i didnt trust him i
 got to thinking about it i was hard
 up and i made up my mind id tell him
 either to come across with some money
 or give me my letters back

   how many were there the detec-
 tive inquired

   eight-counting the one you have
 forbes looked at clyde donovan
 donovan looked steadily back

   go on the inspector commanded
 you came here-about what time

   i should think youd know that with
 all your smartness it was just half
 past ten when i got here

   go on you came up and what did
 you see

   i saw marx lying below the drop-
 light-dying

   dying the detectives voice was
 sharp how do you know that
 ive seen people die before he was
 breathing about once every ten seconds
 and there was a rattle in his throat
 what did you do

   well what could i do i couldnt
 bring him back to life i crossed to
 that box couch and looked into it but
 the papers were gone all of them
 again for an instant inspector
 forbes and young donovan exchanged
 glances then the man from headquar-
 ters was staring at the st john woman

  was the door open when you came
in 

  no but it wasnt locked

  and that door over there

  she glanced uncertainly at the rear
door

  i think both of those bolts were fas-
tened she said but i wouldnt swear
to it

  all right go on when you didnt
find the papers in the couch what did
you do

  i got scared all of a sudden marx
had quit breathing and his eyes were
half open and half shut he was kind
of grinning at me and i ran for it
out into the hall down two flights
of stairs into the street now did you
see any one while you were going
down 

  the actress turned and pointed
steadily at clyde donovan

  he was coming up as i went down
coming back up here youre
sure 

  yes he stopped and looked after
me i know because i turned at the
foot of the steps and looked back up at
him

  inspector borbes nodded and turned
his unfriendly glance upon donovan

  now you he said grimly what
have you got to say for yourself
clyde shook his head

wait a moment said he lets
get this straight this young woman
was in the blackmail business herself
she was in with the fellow i beat up
you heard what she said

  clyde looked angrily around at the
faces turned upon his own

  will some one kindly kick me he
inquired im the biggest dub in cap-
tivity all right inspector what is it
you want me to tell

  i want you to tell everything that
happened here the night of the murder
remember you are not being offered

any kind of immunity-

 immunity your grandmother
the chinese tub



clyde broke in impatiently i didnt
kill him if thats what you mean and
this young woman didnt either eh
what a fool i am

  he shook his head but resumed be-
fore forbes had a chance to prompt
him

  i came up here on some private busi-
ness which doesnt concern any one but
me i had my opinion of this fellow
bursley or marx or whatever his name
was before i came but he made some
remarks directly he learned what my
business with him was that were enough
to fry the back of your neck you see
he had a gun in his pocket and he felt
safe so he told me what he thought
about me and he went on to say some
other things

  a flush had started up in the speak-
ers cheeks he snapped his fingers
looked angrily at the detective and con-
tinued

  i didnt let him get far there are
some things no man is going to say
around me without having a fight on
his hands i jumped him and he jerked
out his gun i hit it with the flat of
my hand and knocked it under the bed
then we had it right he was wiry and
full of tricks he tried to gouge my
eyes and to sink his teeth into my throat
it was like fighting an ape or a baboon
but i worked away at his ribs and he
began to slow down then i let him
have it over the ear and we went down
in a heap

  and then you stabbed him  or did
you get the letters first

  aw forget it clyde donovan re-
quested wearily i didnt stab him
what the deuce would i do that for
id taken him to one honest beating and
i had no trouble finding the letters
that was all i wanted with him
you took the letters and after
that

  i went down into an alley and
burned them it seemed to be the only
thing to do as i didnt have time to

sort out the ones belonging to-the ones
i had come for from the others i
didnt want to be lugging other peoples
love notes around with me i figured
whoever had written them would be
best pleased if they were turned into
ashes so i looked after that and then
i went back to bursleys room just as
this-this woman has told you i
wanted to be sure i hadnt missed any-
thing i noticed the scared look on her
face as she came down she kind of
shrank against the wall and then she
went as fast as she could so when i
got back upstairs and found some one
had got to him while i was away and
had killed him i thought of her

  the speaker paused to give gwen-
dolin st john a scathing look

  if id known the kind of woman she
was he added indignantly i wouldnt
have bothered to take myself off

  so thats your line you ran away
to save the lady how did you think
that would help

  well i dropped my cigarette case
which i was pretty sure you could trace
i had a notion to put my name and ad-
dress in it to be sure and i thought
youd figure i did the killing and look
for me that would give her time to
clear out

  inspector forbes had flushed at men-
tion of the planted cigarette case his
steely eyes were more unpleasant than
usual as he held them unwaveringly on
clyde donovan

  well youre not as smart as you
probably think yourself he commented
you dropped your cigarette case on
purpose or so you say but you also
dropped one of miss st johns letters
and i found it and picked her up if
shes done the killing-but wait a bit
on a low bench against the west wall
of the room stood a bulky something
covered with a newspaper inspector
forbes stepped over it to and drew the
papers away the chinese tub still
filled with water was revealed


detective story magazine

  donovan theres something in that
tub that i want the inspector said
just fish it out and hand it to me will
you

  clyde donovan stared stood up and
approached the tub he peered down
into it then with a frown of bewilder-
ment drew his sleeve above his elbow
and dipped his hand down into the
water he drew out a small shining
tin disk and turned with it to forbes

  though what the deuce you wanted
with it he muttered i dont see-

  a chair turned over with a crash
one of the seated figures was up was
jerking at the rear door charley hin
moved so swiftly that he was in the
shed before forbes could do anything
to stop him

  but next moment the chinaman was
back in the death room he ran with
amazing speed straight for the inspec-
tor in his right hand was a wicked-
looking knife

  inspector forbes should have been
prepared for just this but the startling
quickness of his attackers movements
took him by surprise the chinaman
struck forbes cried out in a thick pro-
testing voice then they were tangled
together were flailing about the room
falling over chairs bumping into walls
stampeding the two women

  shouts and pounding of feet sounded
from the rear stairs four plain-clothes
men were precipitated into the room as
if they had been fired out of a trick
cannon but hin had freed his knife
hand and had drawn it back for a final
fatal blow the detectives would have
been too late to rescue their chief had
it not been for the intervention of clyde
donovan with a cry of dismay he
leaped across stood for a moment sort-
ing out the various arms legs and heads
whirling before him and then struck
his fist landed with an audible thud
and inspector forbes staggered back
releasing his hold on the wiry figure of
his enemy charley hin dropped to the

floor and lay there his fingers quivering
the chinese dagger with which he had
killed marx or bursley and had so
nearly killed inspector forbes lying
where it had fallen

  the detective had been struck one
glancing blow on the wrist doctor
giddings cool and debonair as usual
quickly bandaged it then the young
medical examiner stood looking down
to where hin securely handcuffed was
lying he drew up the chinamans
sleeves stooped farther and uttered an
exclamation of triumph

  there you are inspector said he
cuticle gone from both foreams
bursley put up a fight for his life

  i knew his forearms were scratched
yesterday inspector forbes grunted
he was running his handkerchief round
the inside of his collar it had been a
hot fight while it lasted when he
stuck his hand down into the tub with-
out hauling up his sleeve he stopped
just a moment and i could see him
thinking it over you see id tried out
every one else i could locate who had so
much as spoken to marx and had them
up here for the great chinese tub scene
all the others pulled up their sleeves
some of them tried to fish it out with
a stick but that round disk couldnt be
handled that way thats why i used it
miss st john there had a short-sleeved
rig on the first time i went up to see her
she was in the clear-no scratches
donovan was the last man on the list
though i was pretty certain it was hin
by that time if youd just come for-
ward young fellow so that i could have
had your story to fit into the case for
the medical examiner and the prelim-
inary hearing-but you had to go tear-
ing off protecting the innocent young
thing you thought had done the job

  i thought hed been blackmailing
her and if he had id have let them
hang me rather than betray her for giv-
ing what he had coming clyde con-
fessed
the chinese tub



  no doubt you would well doc i
guess you get the trophy it was you
and your microscope that did the trick
all i had to do was to run down the
one party out of a million or so that
had had cuticle scratched off the fore-
arms and then gather in the lost sheep
and get them to blat their stories you
win

  the young physician looked reprov-
ing i just gave you a little technical
assistance inspector you caught the
killer

  charley hin was moving about his
eyes open his manacled hands groping
toward his throat he smiled evilly as
the inspector looked down at him

  the voice of the fool is never still
said he but the dagger whispers a
word and the strong man bows him-
self in obeisance

  what did you kill him for char-
ley forbes demanded was he
blackmailing you too 

  he stole my sweetheart-in china
hin replied he was a white devil
and she was a yellow rose now she is
dead and he is dead and you may do
as you please with me i have been
educated in the white mans schools and
believe neither in his gods nor in my
own the words of the wise man and
the words of fools are alike for a
little while they break the silence-and
then both alike are still

  forbes nodded

  and a good thing it is at that he
commented philosophically it would
be a bad day for the detective business j
if dead men began talking all theyd j

have to do with a murder kick is to
bring the body of the deceased in and
let him tell the jury his story

  jim riddel returned late that night
a worried look on his face he came
into his wifes room paused as he
crossed the threshold and seemed to be
studying her expression

  everything all right dear he in-
quired anxiously i got home as early
as i could i had to talk over a little
matter with some fellows

  the words stuck in his throat he
blushed till his face seemed about to
catch fire

  helen was now looking steadily at
him

  jim she said softly what did my
friend inspector forbes do to you

  your friend-inspector forbes-

  but jim was in no condition to talk
he mopped his forehead and sank into
a chair he stole a stealthy glance at
the very pretty and obviously amused
young woman who sat watching him

  tell me dear do you love me he
blurted

of course how can you ask
and there isnt any one else
there never has been jim you
have always been my hero-my sun-
crowned hero

  jim made a rush at her and gath-
ered her into his arms

  im a fool he whispered but no
more of that jealousy stuff for me it
burns me up

  helen smiled up at him through misty
eyes

cr

busy days for the poisoner

a man who was arrested a few months ago on the charge of poisoning a night
watching of a new york laboratory has been found to be a chronic poisoner
apparently the poisoning business became a never-ending source of delight he
admitted to having perpetrated twelve of these atrocities and not only admitted
but boasted of it his manner when arraigned before the judge was nonchalant
and undisturbed
his date with death

there was no room in him for hate or malice

by clinton danger field

author of that legal crime etc

helter temporary safety
and fire claibourne had but
no food he faced the grim
necessity of going down into
the plain to seek supplies at the risk
which it involved

  he drank again from the spring near
him tightened his belt an inch more
made his way down the mountain and
thence into the foothills six feet of
lithe young manhood a lonely but gal-
lant figure firm-lipped the gray eyes
steady and piercing

  the sun was now near setting the
friendly shades of night would he
hoped enable him to secure needed food
from some prosperous kitchen

  he pushed on keeping what cover he
could find-for although he had se-
cured a suit of ordinary clothing he
was a marked man over him hung the
sword of the states price on his head
for this day had been appointed as clai-
bournes date with death he had
broken jail last week through un-
exampled courage and ingenuity he
had good hopes of making a seaport and
starting life again where hed be un-
known hope is uncrushable at twenty-
two

 he moved on watching the road
which he paralleled but dared not fol-
low listening with strained ears for the
slightest sound of men to him they
his date with death



were no longer men but a wolf pack
trailing him

  yet it wasnt a man that halted him
it was the sudden sight of a roadside
placard nailed to a white oak noth-
ing about the reward but showing in
sprawling handwriting a message at
which the fugitive stared in mingled as-
tonishment and fury

  absorbed in the paragraph written
there he did not hear the approach of
two horsemen until they were almost
on him but he was so swift and so
silent in rushing back to his cover in the
green kentucky copse that he gained a
hiding place in time

  the riders halted at the writing and
read it in evident astonishment one
of them frowned as he exclaimed

  i dont see why claibourne should
poke his neck any further into the noose
by carrying off lucy whitwire

  must be plumb off his head about
her returned the other darn pretty
aint she tapsalter

  lucy whitwire said the first
speaker a heavy-set middle-aged man
is lovely in an unusual sort of way
her hairs the palest gold her skins
translucent with just a faint wash of
rose on the cheeks her eyes are blue
but its so pale a blue that its just a
pastel color barely blue at all and yet
the eyes are beautiful and fringed round
with great long soft lashes she has
a very pretty humility in the way she
drops her lids flatters a man her
mouths that cupids-bow business her
hands are small and sort of fluttery like
little butterflies shes a peg to hang
dreams on

  the other stared

  you always talk queerly tapsalter
he said then as tapsalter gathered up
his reins wait till i fix this stirrup
leather wasnt this shelton claibourne
engaged to kate seymour

  yes growled tapsalter and shed
have stood by him through thick and
thin but lucy whitwire engaged to

claibourne broke her engagement with
the first hint of suspicion that he was a
murderer she never even waited for
the decision in court of course her
father had been against it from the first
and lucy never would have been en-
gaged to this fellow shelton claibourne
if it hadnt been that claibourne owned
as strong a will in his way as whitwire
did in his their wills balanced about
even for lucy but with love in the
balance the scales went down on clai-
bournes side

  on the other hand remarked the
other when he was arrested the scales
went down on her dads side didnt
they

  yes said tapsalter she wrote
shelton claibourne a sweet little note
saying that she knew of course he
wouldnt want her dragged into any-
thing like that you might say that
shelton claibourne was lucky to get
free of her

  how could he be lucky about any-
thing when hes a hunted fugitive up in
the hills-a man who should have been
hung to-day and only cheated the gal-
lows by a margin so narrow it was
something like a miracle the devil
with this leather its plumb rotten

  you ride with too short a stirrup-
throws a steady strain on the strap
said tapsalter claibournes like me
-a long stirrup rider i hope he gets
through to a seaport

  then hed better not fool around
with lucy whitwire retorted his com-
panion and the two rode on together
leaving the man in the copse mutely
staring after them

  lucy whitwire

  yes they had described her rightly
she was a feather and no more whirled
on the wind of other peoples wills and
in order to win lucys moonlight-and-
lily loveliness he had turned away like
a fool from the less ethereal beauty of
kate seymour kate of the steadfast
eyes and of a constancy so great that


detective story magazine

when the storm rose against shelton
claibourne it was she who had visited
him and had tried to console him

  neither girl could ever be his now
he no longer desired lucy he re-
called with amazement his infatuation
for her and any hope of life with
kate would have been too fantastic to
contemplate for he was a hunted
fugitive who had barely escaped the
noose for the present and might yet
be taken in its hideous circle

  he stared again at the written plac-
ard lucy carried off this thing
had happened to her there was at least
one man whom she had wrought to a
desperation ready to take any chance-
jim brocklehurst

  a cruel savage suspected of crimes
which might land him in jail for the
rest of his life fox clever for he had
forged claibournes handwriting had
loaded on claibourne all suspicion

  lucy what better did she deserve
the dream was ashes let her go
madness to think of her madness to
waste pity on her merely because she
had once been the peg on which to
hang his dreams

  what if chance had given him shel-
ton claibourne knowledge of-

  hang it all he must get about his busi-
ness of obtaining supplies this was
life to be caught in the clutch of cir-
cumstance to be broken on the wheel
of accident let her take her share of
it

  as the shades of night darkened
around shelton claibourne in his search
for food lights began to appear here
and there in the fine mansion of john
whitwire-prosperous kentucky tobac-
conist and influential citizen

  gas and electric lights hadnt come in
yet yellow kerosene lamps were the
source of illumination one of the
largest of these blazed out from john
whitwires private den a match had
been put to it by whitwires crony

peter tapsalter who had just arrived
and was waiting for his friend to come
in

  tapsalter was a man who took life
easily he sat there smoking placidly
but listening keenly

  now he heard on the driveway below
the drumming rhythm of a horse ap-
proaching at a hand gallop and in a
few moments john whitwire strode in
haggard and dusty

  he closed the door behind him tap-
salter did not rise he only said very
quietly

  got your wire and came at once i
hear youve been in the saddle day and
night hunting her no luck at all
whitwire flung himself into a chair
he sat erect even in his grief a
finely chiseled impressive-looking man
piercing-eyed with a gaze as hard as
a hawks his words filtered through
his closed teeth biting down on his rage
and despair as he answered

  no luck at all shes gone that
devil claibourne has found a way to
knife me in the back ill never see
lucy again look here

  tapsalter took the paper glanced at
it and returned it to whitwire saying
slowly

  yes i saw one just like it on my
way here its evidently been posted in
duplicate are you sure thats clai-
bournes handwriting

  of course im sure ive seen his
signature many a time on his letters to
lucy but if the placard were printed
it would still be genuine for claibourne
would have dictated it

  whitwire sprang up as he spoke he
walked about in great agitation

  lord he said thickly my lucy
at the mercy of a man who escaped
with the noose almost around his neck
tapsalter said slowly yes hed
have been hung all right if he hadnt
escaped even the pardoning governor
wouldnt pardon him and yet some-
how i never could quite figure that
his date with death



so many people think claibourne inno-
cent he-

  but whit wire interrupted him pas-
sionately 

  shelton claibournes son clai-
bourne the second worse than even his
father was

  whitwire tapsalter said frown-
ing you never were quite normal on
the subject of the claibournes youve
got a hate hang-over thats worse than
any whisky hang-over i ever saw lots
of people believe this shelton claibourne
to be innocent but you only see in him
an enemys son you only see in him
the breed of a man who took ellen
bracebridge away from you and mar-
ried her because of this fugitives
mother you arent quite normal where
these claibournes are concerned
whitwire whipped fiercely round on
him

  is this any time to be preaching to

me 

  tapsalter thrust his hands into his
pockets

  dont be an idiot he said im
not preaching im trying to make you
feel that your girl lucy could be in
worse hands than shelton claibournes
whitwire cried out his fingers balling
into fists

  how could the whole thing be
worse this is the day on which shel-
ton claibourne was due to be hung in-
stead of that hes up in these inacces-
sible nightmare mountains somewhere
with my girl tapsalter do something
cant you  for heavens sake is there
nothing you can think of

  ill go and wire for a brace of dogs
i heard of yesterday maybe they can

pick up the scent until then-

  he snapped off the sentence and both
men whirled at the sound of a low but
dominant voice from the door

  reach gentlemen

  their hands went up for there at the
closed door stood the man who had a
date with death-shelton claibourne

  their hands had gone up instinctively
but now they saw that shelton clai-
bournes hands were empty his voice
as low but as dominant as before broke
a trifle mockingly on their ears

  i merely wanted to keep your hands
in the air long enough to let you get
used to my presence gentlemen i have
no gun

  whitwires revolver leaped out
shelton claibourne smiled a little con-
temptuously

  i wouldnt bother with that sort of
thing he said you can kill me any
time you like an unarmed man is no
danger to you but let us talk first i
came here about lucy i didnt write
that note that was posted by the man
who really got your daughter and fixed
the blame on me a pretty shrewd
trick chalking it up to the revenge mo-
tive that i might have against you be-
cause you have never been my friend
and have always opposed my engage-
ment to lucy

  his eager glance went directly to tap-
salter

  you mr tapsalter he continued
discussed this matter with a friend of
yours when you passed the placard
posted near a thick copse i was there
listening id already seen that placard
and i wish id never seen it for ive
had a devil of a fight with myself on
the one side i already had safety and
on the other there was lucy in the
hands of this man

  in the hands of what man tap-
salter demanded sharply

  whitwire seemed beyond speech his
gun hand had fallen to his side and he
was listening in a confused astonish-
ment

  what man repeated tapsalter in-
sistently

  the man answered shelton clai-
bourne who has always been suspected
through this whole county of illegal
practices even suspected of counterfeit-
ing and yet nothing has ever been


detective story magazine

proved against him do you know who
i mean

  jim brocklehurst exclaimed tap-
salter and you claim he forged this
message in your handwriting

  tapsalter if it were not so would
i be here

  tapsalter cursed

  claibournes gaze flashed to whit-
wire

  dont misunderstand me john whit-
wire  he said i havent come to you
for the love that i feel for lucy now
ive ceased to love her but i can never
forget all she stirred in me when we
were engaged a mans first dream of
love is never forgotten for the sake
of that dream ive risked everything to
come here because this was the one place
in which a man lucys father would
be driven by love of her to trust me
with horses and guns and help secret
help

  whitwire was dumb the fugitive
rushed on i want you whitwire and
i want you tapsalter but first of all
i want food and drink and then the
three of us will take her to-night from
the hands of jim brocklehurst i know
where hes got her hidden theres only
one place where he could put through
a thing like this he has an ally up
there in the hills lucyll be forced into
marriage there to-night brocklehurst
wont find that hard whatever the
strongest mind nearest her wills she
does but maybe well get there in
time whitwire to give her back into
your hands still lucy whitwire
whitwire gasped every word that
this fugitive spoke was weighted with
truth haggard from lack of food
scratched with briers dusty with crawl-
ing on his hands and knees through
bushes where he must have cover un-
armed and condemned-shelton clai-
bourne held in the hollow of his hand
the two men listening to him

  claibourne continued sharply you
tapsalter go down to the kitchen and

fetch for us here coffee and food loclc
the door after you when you go out
so that no one can get in here but
hurry

  tapsalter went he sped to the
kitchen and in his going he muttered
to himself jumbled sentences and
strange oaths

  an hour later three men were far
into the foothills that prefaced the
mountains rising in grim majesty above
them

  they were headed for a woods road
which twisted up into those heights
where the law lost interest and did not
try to penetrate they rode three
blooded kentucky horses and they were
about to rise into realms where nature
still claims her own and bars out with
jutting boulder and closed forest the
intrusions of civilization a strange
forest country of good and of ill in
which the good predominates and yet
suffers with indifference the existence
of crime holding that each mans home
is his own castle and therein he may do
what he pleases so long as he does not
intrude upon the castle of his neighbor
he is safe

  those three riders-the impeccable
citizen john whitwire his respected
friend tapsalter and the fugitive who
had that day a date with the noose-had
not yet gained the woods road when
they heard the bang and rattle of steel-
tired buckboard the rapid trot of har-
nessed horses

  shelton claibourne spurred his horse
into the darkening safety of a little
ravine hidden from the roadway by a
thick screen of brush yet when the
buckboard halted before the other two
riders the fugitive was not a yard away
from the sheriff of the county who
snarled out

  whos there and then oh its
you mr whitwire and mr tapsalter
the sheriffs tone changed into respect
and sympathy i suppose youre on the
same errand as myself hunting that es-
his date with death



caped murderer-shelton claibourne
hes put the cap on the climax by ab-
ducting your girl i never heard of
such gall in a criminal have you any
clew 

  no said whitwire no clew

  his tone was monotonous he felt
strangely shaken a sudden doubt had
come over him about shelton clai-
bourne perhaps lucy was already this
fugitives wife and he himself was be-
ing trapped into the mountains to be
murdered a thousand grim sugges-
tions darted through his mind and for
a second he was torn by conflicting dis-
trust and suspicion then the sheriff
said

  ive had a tip mr whitwire a
sure tip claibournes headed for the
junction hes aiming to swing a
freight there and im aiming to be
there in time you can come with me
if you like and leave the horses or
you can turn back and ride at your lei-
sure aint no use in your going on
here

  thanks said whitwire in the same
blank voice ill turn back and ride at
my leisure i hope you get him sher-
iff

  i hope i do said the sheriff i
never heard of such a thing gallows
food like him going off with a girl like
your lucy so long

  the buckboard was gone the con-
demned man rode out from the little
ravine the three resumed their jour-
ney

  in a hundred yards they turned into
the woods road which was overgrown
with bushes the road was still used
occasionally but the forest dwellers who
used it drove their heavy wagons over
the brush and weeds

  higher the riders rose and higher

  the moon climbed with them as they
went and the thoughts of whitwire
were like the night-patches of white
and patches of black for black hate of
claibourne rode in whitwires heart

and white hope that he might still save
his lucy his idolized daughter

  another hour passed and suddenly
claibourne checked them

  listen he exclaimed i hear a
man singing and you can tell by the
way the sound shifts that hes patrolling
a cliff under the house in which well
find lucy since there are sentinels
out the wedding must be going on
now

  kill him whitwire said in a low
hoarse and murderous tone hell give
the alarm and well loose everything
kill him

  no claibourne retorted life is
as sweet to him as to you and me ill
get him in a way that wont do him any
great harm you stay here with the
horses

  he tossed his own reins to whitwire
and disappeared into the underbrush
making a steady and extraordinarily
noiseless way toward the sentinel

  claibourne came out on the ledge just
above his man but the fellow by that
time had ridden up the road a little way
there he halted yawned seemed half
minded to go farther still

  then he turned his horse grumbling
aloud to the night cursing his luck that
he had been set upon this solitary job
when up at the outlaw den above feast-
ing and drinking were going on

  nothing is so bad that it cant be
worse freedom of movement and a
cigarette the sentinel had but now in
the midst of his cursing complaints
there suddenly descended upon his
shoulders dropping like a cougar from
the overhang something which tore him
with irresistible strength from his horse
pulling him down to the ground and
sending the terrified animal galloping
wildly off into the night

  but the surprised sentinel did not
succumb tamely

  he was a big man and a powerful
one moreover as the two pitched to
the ground together a writhing heave

of the outlaws body had brought him
on top the destinies of that night
trembled in the balance as the two men
were molded together in a composite
form of fighting fury

  they rolled and surged there writing
the tale of their struggle on crushed
scrub and loosened soil then suddenly
one figure arose partly still kneeling on
the chest of the other keeping the man
under him down by iron fingers locked
around his throat

  claibourne whistled whitwire and
tapsalter came at a gallop

  three minutes later the sentinel was
looking back on his former occupation
as something he had totally failed to
appreciate for instead of being able
to shift up and down the road as he
pleased he was hog tied a stick with
a handerchief wrapped around it had
been fastened in his mouth by the simple
device of knotting another handkerchief
on the stick and then passing the cloth
around his head unable to yell un-
able to move except with the most pain-
ful floundering he heard the hoofbeats
of three horses die rapidly away

  his horse had been caught and tied
where it could carry no alarming tid-
ings

  a few yards more and claibourne
said coldly they must leave the horses
and go up the zigzag path which would
bring them out near a part of the house
little likely to be used since the scal-
ing of the cliff on that side was no easy
matter

  til lead the way he said you
follow

  but lucy protested whitwire
we can never bring her down those
rocks

  no said claibourne tersely well
bring her around the safer way we
can afford to do that then for the whole
place will be in confusion and tap-
salter he added can take the horses
around to where the safe road conies
down just follow this dry creek bed

tapsalter and youll come to it about
two miles down

  tapsalter nodded and in another mo-
ment was moving off on his own mount
leading the other horses

  facing the cliff which was to be
scaled whitwire groaned aloud

  oh we can never make it

  cut that said claibourne impa-
tiently thoughts like those are a
chain drag on a mans hands and feet
we shall make it say that to your-
self 

  claibourne began whitwtire
hoarsely

- the other man flashed round on him
and said curtly what dont burn
up our time here for nothing dont
just stand there and talk

  no said whitwire no youre
right lets go on

  claibourne led the way

  there was a cool confidence in his
movements a reassurance in his steady
voice that occasionally called softly
down to the older man behind him it
enabled whitwire to do the thing he
had always feared-swarm up the face
of a broken cliff where a false footing
or the loosening of a shrub in some
cranny might mean pitching down to
the earth below

  whitwire had almost a phobia against
this kind of thing and cold perspiration
sprang out in beads on his face as he
toiled upward-the dewy damp of ter-
ror

  it seemed to whitwire a century be-
fore finally he saw the man ahead of him
vanish over the top of a sort of shelf
and then beheld the hand of claibourne
reach down to assist him

  he grasped it eagerly and now they
both stood on the top together

  jim brocklehurst a study in red stood
before the half-drunken justice of the
peace whom he had purveyed for this
occasion

  red was brocklehursts hair and nearly
his date with death



as red his large coarse face which yet
had a certain handsomeness in its shap-
ing red-brown were his eyes fierce
and compelling reddish tan were his
big hands hanging by his side-hairy
and spatulate hands there were scarlet
flashes in the tie that he wore to enhance
his personal appearance on this occasion
it went well he thought that tie with
his blue suit he smiled at the justice
and the smile showed a row of big white
teeth flawless and glistening

  beside him stood the girl whom if
had coerced into this marriage exactly
as shelton claibourne had foreseen this
lovely feather tossed on the current of
mens wills had not the personality to
save herself from any mans persistence

  she was of the kind that in great
cities go down into the dregs of life-
the kind that a higher class saves by
incessant watchfulness and chaperoning
yet after her fashion she felt rage and
despair over her situation she realized
that the dominant and mesmeric will of
the man beside her was too strong to
fight and yet she said to herself that
he was coarse common horrible

  if she did not have courage she had
taste and in her pale way she hated
him as they stood there-and hated the
wedding guests behind her-nearly a
dozen lawless men some of them were
counterfeiters several others were
thieves who preyed on the cattle and
stock in the valley below at scattered in-
tervals and still others were men who
had taken refuge up here either from
the law or from the personal vengeance
of some of their own kin

  this gathering constituted the ele-
ment which the better class of the forest
dwellers left strictly alone

  the wedding guests were all in a good
humor from parsin the knife thrower
to upwether the giant who was the
crack shot of the assemblage theo-
retically they should all have laid aside
their weapons for this occasion but
they were men whose weapons were part

of them as much so as their hands or
their feet they were still armed

  though in liquor the justice renegade
as he was felt uneasy he said

  jim you sure this is all o k 
lucy commanded brocklehursts
compelling voice tell him you want to
marry me

  she struggled to utter a denial but
his fierce clutch was on her wrist she
felt the red fire of his eyes plunging in
electric positive waves through her
negative mind acquiescence was torn
out of her instead of denial

  i want she faltered and the justice
could scarcely catch her faint tone to

  the word broke in its inception and
she stiffened inside the arm which
brocklehurst passed around her flash-
ing a quick look at her he saw that her
features had changed her eyes were
dilated her mouth slowly opening as
though the lips parted for a scream

  while his eyes were on her face
brocklehurst heard behind him a rush
of sound the blended confusion of
curses involuntarily reeking out from
half a dozen throats

  with catlike quickness his head
turned over his left shoulder in hurried
surprise but he stared into the gaping
faces of his guests who werent looking
at him but at something beyond

  brocklehurst whipped back and saw
that he the justice his men were all
under cover of two guns in the steady
hands of the man whose name he had
used in abducting lucy whitwire

  for a moment he thought that his
own vision had deceived him the feel-
ing was so strong that he exclaimed
claibourne you it cant be
as the words left his lips lucy gal-
vanized into action by a pair of eyes
which were not claibournes darted
from under the arms of her bridegroom
rushed to the left and sprang into the
eager clasp of her father

  whitwire snatched her up he flung

round and disappeared through the back
exit obeying claibournes orders al-
ready given he went with a swift
celerity of movement that made brockle-
hurst feel that he himself might have
had a drink too much but his jaws
clenched on the cold reality for clai-
bournes voice rang through the room 
reach every man of you

  every hand went high but one man
in the group brought something in his
hand as it rose parsin the knife
thrower his glittering blade flashed
through the air missed claibournes
bare head by the merest fraction and
buried itself in the wall beyond where
it stuck quivering and humming
shelton claibourne laughed

  a man only has so much bad luck
he said measured out for him out-
side of that you cant hurt him i saw
who threw that what if i picked you
off friend in return for that little com-
pliment 

  no-no i was rattled i didnt
aim

  well claibourne interrupted his
eyes flashing back to brocklehursts red
face throwing a knife in the face of a
gun is at least a mans act it sets a
man a lot sight higher than the fellow
who forges my name to cover kidnaping
a girl youre a cur brocklehurst
and youre a fool that dont know
enough to keep his neck out of the
rope retorted brocklehurst who in no
way lacked for courage although like
the others his hands had gone above his
head what i did showed some brains
what youve done here to-night-sav-
ing from her own squeamishness a girl
who never cared enough for you to
stand by you when you were in trouble-
shows that youre just plain loco clai-
bourne and youll never get away
from this house alive youve got the
drop on us now but you cant keep it
on every one all the time

  not get away from here alive said
claibourne and there was a sudden chill

laughter in his voice well lets see
brocklehurst what sort of a prophet
youare

  as he spoke shelton claibourne fired
the big kerosene chandelier dropped to
the roar of his gun the room was
plunged in darkness and became in-
stantly a maelstrom of confusion and
oaths

  brocklehurst reached the back door
almost as soon as claibourne did but
his activity was unhealthful for his wel-
f je for as he reached for the door-
knob the fist of shelton claibourne
caught him in a driving blow which
dropped him unconscious to the floor
in the next second claibourne was
through the door had turned the key
on the outside and was gone

  past star after star the silvery moon
climbed in cold beauty now and then
a cloud drifted across her face and in-
visible fingers seemed to tear it aside
again when she began to sink toward
the western horizon almost into the
arms of the coming day lucy herself
was sound asleep in her pretty bedroom

  while she slept safely and luxuri-
ously three figures rose from a table
at which they had eaten and drunk in
secret

  as they rose and went to the fire-
place each dropping into a chair whit-
wire said slowly offering cigarettes to
his guests

  claibourne ive been counted a sane
level-headed man but in that ride from
brocklehursts den there in the cold
moonlight with my girl behind me and
you at my side i think i realized at last
what letting an idea run away with one
means ive been a one-idea man clai-
bourne and i just about believe that the
fellow thats that cant be balanced ive
made money and i have influence i
can be diplomatic and i can be kind
but all those things in my life have been
subsidiary to the one big idea you know
what i mean-that idea

            ds-c
his date with death



  claibourne shook his hfead but the
listening tapsalter nodded slightly

  hate said whitwire it began
with your father claibourne your
father was a bad man dear through
admitted said claibourne coolly
he was a bad man clear through and
so was your own dad both of us
sprang from the loins of men without
scruples hard as steel and mean as
lynxes but no mans mind is a replica
of his fathers

  reasonable said whitwire slowly
reasonable and right but to me you
were the reincarnation of my enemy
you cant imagine claibourne what a
replica of him you are youve got his
gestures his eyes his tone and i said
to myself that you were just a picce
split off from his soul as far as your
mind went and when i found that
you loved my girl i came near killing
you i had brooded so long

  your father was dead in a sense
yes underground but here he was
again in another form in the first
form he had taken the girl i loved and
wanted to marry in the second form
-you-he was about to take the girl
i loved because she was my child bone
of my bone flesh of my flesh i sup-
pose you cant understand claibourne
i suppose you although you are your
fathers son have never hated an-
swer me do you know what hate
means 

  i know what fury means said clai-
bourne grimly and i know what de-
spair means but in the sense in which
you describe hate becoming the chief
thread in your whole life i know noth-
ing of such a thing as that it seems
to me that sort of hate is something that
hurts the hater worse than the hated
dont be too sure about that whit-
wire returned with equal grimness if
i had not hated you as i did you would
have been a free man now you would
never have been condemned you
would never even have been arrested

 ds-c

   tapsalter uttered an inarticulate ex-
clamation claibourne started up
what

  sit down said whitwire sit
down and let me finish while im still
under the influence of what youve done
to-night

  claibourne dropped back into his
chair whitwire went on

  i had in my hand evidence which
was brought to me by a man who was
killed the next day in an automobile ac-
cident that evidence would have
cleared you and will still clear you
clear me gasped claibourne
you mean that

  yes dont interrupt me  you may
break the spell yet in which i see myself
as i have been before or after you
were condemned i could have saved
you worse yet i am a friend a close
and intimate friend of the governor
he was about to pardon you but he
thinks a lot of my opinon i turned
him at the last minute i tightened the
noose around your neck so far as i
am concerned in intent i killed you
as he spoke whitwire rose walked
to his safe opened it came back again
and threw on the table beside shelton
claibourne a packet tapsalter star-
ing remained silent

  there is your evidence said whit-
wire i shall go with it to the gov-
ernor and ill tell him in the morning
the same tale i have told you and tap-
salter here to-night ill hide you here
until youre pardoned you will have
to incur the ignominy of a pardon when
you are as i know guiltless yes the
governor will pardon you claibourne
but you who out of your generosity
have turned a searchlight on my own
soul you who have acquired freedom
by being too big for my hate to crush
you will never be big enough to pardon
me

  silence fell in the room claibourne
was struggling with the emotion of a
joy so tremendous so wildly stirring


detective story magazine

that it might almost be said to have
repaid him for all that he had gone
through

  he knew now what most of us can
never know-the halcyon joy of restor-
ation and for a little while in that
silence there was in his mind a glad-
ness so great that when he rose and
walked to one of the windows he stag-
gered slightly drunk with the wine of
unexpected freedom

  then from the recesses of his soul
from those depths where live in all of
us hates and jealousies there flared up
inside of him a red fire of fury before
which his joy receded

  how unnecessary how cruel how un-
speakably vicious low and mean how
hideous beyond words had been the in-
jury done him

  his hand grasped the window sill and
closed on it till the knuckles whitened

  but this mood also passed that in
his soul which enabled him to save lucy

now enabled him to save himself from
becoming in his turn what the humili-
ated and repentant man near him had
been all his life-an embittered hater

  the fire of desired revenge died in
shelton claibourne he turned toward
whitwire and said simply

  i do understand what you have been
whitwire you werent normal per-
haps from now on you will be when
you have done what you will do-clear
me and set me free-if we cannot part
friends we can at least part as those
who bear no malice toward each other
whitwires glance fell he said hum-
bly i hadnt deserved so much
shelton claibourne glanced toward
the east morning was deepening into
day-a new day of freedom of justifi-
cation reflected in the rosy sunrise col-
ors still tinting the sky he saw no longer
the moonlight loveliness of lucy but
the glowing steadfast eyes of kate sey-

  bad mans blackmail  by roy w hinds coming
                  next week 

kills wife twice

 hat amounted to a double killing occurred recently in florola alabama

     a man wished to get rid of his wife he said that they were of different
religions and could not agree but whether this was the only reason police could
not ascertain

    the husband gave his wife something to drink which contained poison and
then took her for an automobile ride it was not long before she died of the
effects of the poison administered in order that no one would find out that he
had murdered her the wife killer decided to be doubly sure he ran the car to
the edge of a steep embankment and jumped clear just before it went crashing
over then he ran down to the wreckage crawled beneath the debris and when
the catastrophe was discovered it was at first presumed that the wife was killed
outright while her husband escaped injury

    although it might easily happen that one party emerges uninjured while the
other dies the police in this particular case were suspicious a number of things
pointed to reasonable doubt that the affair had been a genuine accident after a
long grilling the murderer confessed
mr philibus-
thousand-dollar man

mr philibus protects this gentle creature
by using him in his own trick

  by leslie gordon barnard

author of green-handed etc

ilted comfortably back in a
chair in his hotel bedroom
mr philibus read an evening
paper and chuckled to himself
his most recent exploit was still news
quite a daring affair almost more ven-
turesome than should tie undertaken by
a gentleman with a passion for liberty of
movement

  moreover it was now a full week
since the coup had been pulled off and
here not a stones throw from the scene
itself sat the perpetrator calmly chuck-
ling over his success

  setting aside the paper he descended
in the hotel elevator and walked calmly
through the crowded rotunda exchang-
ing a wink with the telephone operator

who did not discourage the attention
and a cigar with the house detective
who liked good brands and felt very
friendly toward this respectable middle-
aged guest

  mr philibus exposing the headlines
concerning himself tapped the paper to
call the detectives attention to it

  surprised you havent nabbed the
reward offered he said laughing
this bird likely enough is hanging
around places such as this i should
in his shoes much safer than making
a get-away

  naw said the house detective
these birds aint got the nerve for that
believe me this bird you speak of is
half a continent away


detective story magazine

  with your experience said mr
philibus mildly doubtless you are cor-
rect

  i just wish said the house detec-
tive quickly he was hereabouts that
thousand bucks would fit very pretty in
the pocket of yours truly

  mr philibus considered this

  well now he said on second
thought im not quite so sure id care
about that reward old grewgerry is
offering it himself you know

  sure why not aint he the guy
that got the loot stole off him and got
biffed up pretty bad himself fetched
him a pretty crack in the eye this crook
did and beat him up plenty besides
taking enough from his safe to make
any man mad

  after all said mr philibus quietly
is anybody very sorry for grewgerry
if that man had all the oil produced or
prospective out of the oil wells hes
foisted on a dizzy public hed not have
enough to anoint his ugly bald head
the detective laughed

  hes a smooth one all right he de-
clared half admiringly keeps within
the law though thats brains that is
you got to hand it to him for that hes
kep himself out of jail nicely

  and sent better men to jail said
mr philibus evenly and sent widows
to paupers graves and children on to
the streets with his pretty schemes id
like to see the man who would take his
dirty money

  the detective chuckled but his eyes
gleamed a little

  well take a good look mister he
suggested

  at you said mr philibus grimly
now

  at me

  youd take his filthy money

  for a thousand dollars said the
other id not care to say what id
do he laughed again he must
want this guy pretty bad to go a thou-
sand 

  i fancy said mr philibus dreamily
hes a little put out

  well i shouldnt be surprised i
know him he often comes in here and
ive heard him boast nobody can get the
better of him gosh here he is now
mr philibus veered round a podgy
ill-shapen figure evidently only recently
out of medical care had entered the
rotunda mr philibus eyes narrowed
he could wish now hed given the fel-
low a richer dose his pride had cer-
tainly not been taken down grewgerry
swaggered in with three friends as if he
owned the hotel they came to a halt
not far from where mr philibus stood

  personal grudge grewgerry was
saying maybe he had lots of peo-
ple fancy they have something against
me wonder why four tones of
laughter merged naw inr not afraid
of a repetition the fellows the other
side of the country by now yellow
these chaps if he hadnt had me at a
disadvantage id have laid him out
proper yod could see hed have run
if id had half a chance no sir youll
not see josiah j grewgerry bitten twice
in the same place

  mr philibus sneezed

  whats that the detective swung
around was that you the little
group round grewgerry had turned
also

  sneeze said mr philibus hasnt
a man a right to sneeze in a free land 
woof

  mr josiah grewgerry and his three
friends went to the cigar counter
equipped themselves with the fattest and
best then adjourned to a quiet portion
of the lobby where they kept an antici-
patory concentration on the door every
time it revolved to usher in a newcomer
they were all attention

  maybe said one of them he wont
come grewgerry

  come grewgerry laughed you
couldnt keep this hick away with a ten-
foot pole with a spoke on the end no
mr philibus-thousand-dollar man



i reckon hes so overcome with the
honor of dinin with four leadin repre-
sentatives of big business he cant get
the studs into his soup-and-fish shirt if
he has one

  a tall sallow member of the party
laughed

  by the time we get through with
him hell not have any kind of a shirt
left

  there he is said grewgerry

  that

  the same

  weeping willows isnt he a perfect
lamb

  the man who approached now to
whose timid advance grewgerry moved
forward with smiling countenance and
welcoming hand was perhaps four feet
nine inches tall being thus cast by na-
ture he had achieved through the fifty
or more years of his life a habit of
looking up hopefully at his taller fel-
lows the skillful gentlemen who por-
tray in cartoons mr general public
must have gone to him for the pince-
nez the sad mustache and other essen-
tials of that composite character

  mr blaine said grewgerry expan-
sively leading him forward meet mr
waldenus waldenus mr blaine the
gentleman from the west i was speak-
ing about graham mr blaine and
porter have a cigar mr blaine
no well i dont know as i blame
you funny habit before dinner per-
haps we might as well go on in gentle-
men 

  little mr blaine who looked equally
ready to bolt and to accept and enjoy
his moment of bliss in this distinguished
company adjusted his shirt studs nerv-
ously after the manner of a man who
is not sure when theyr will pop and ex-
pose the honest wool beneath and was
shepherded into the glitter and expen-
sive simplicity of the dining room

  grewgerry handling even the amaz-
ing head waiter as one accustomed to
obeisance winked at waldenus

  little mr blaine still agitated about
the propensities of his studs sat down
on his chair his face-full of a pain-
ful ecstasy-not very high above an ar-
ray of silver and cutlery calculated to
terrify the stoutest heart

  you left your wife well i hope mr
blaine

  thank you mr grewgerry-yes

  you are fortunate in having a wife
mr blaine whose instincts are pro-
gressively businesslike i have explained
to you gentlemen i think-he waived
a hand at his company-that mr and
mrs blaine have come into a nice little
legacy and intend to invest it with dis-
cretion and profit they noticed the
offering of commonlite unlimited oil
and at once recognized its supreme at-
tractiveness that mr blaine should
come all the way here to look into it
personally is gratifying ones faith in
human perspicacity is shaken so often
by people who rush madly into specu-
lation

  look said mr grewgerry shaking
his head sadly at the awful debacle of
the stock market and have some hors
doeuvre mr blaine terrible how
some people rush into danger that way
now take oil-an essential industry-a
bed-rock industry there said mr
grewgerry emphasizing the position
with a sardine theres the property
it cant run away it cant dissolve all
you got to do is get the oil out of it
and a ready markets waiting you can
see that mr blaine

  little mr blaine worrying an olive
with a fork chevying it with the tines
around the side of his plate race-course
fashion agreed that he could see that
indeed anybody could see just then
mr grewgerry having a passion for
them swallowed the sardine but just
a little of the oil remained mr grew-
gerry being quick on the uptake pointed
out humorously the symbolism of even
this

  oil he enthused you cant es-


detective story magazine

cape it soup mr blaine let me
recommend the potage

  the symbolism of the soup mr
grewgerry left untouched he went
on through several courses to point outv
mr blaines excellent chances of getting
in on the ground floor then leaving all
this material to sink into mr blaines
head which was capable of much ab-
sorption that way he spoke with the
three gentlemen of developments likely
mr blaine might be excused if he felt
he was being privileged to listen in at
a directors meeting of the commonlite
unlimited oil

  there was quite a bit of talk about
the ground floor mr blaine could not
help being impressed nobody men-
tioned the basement nor yet the blue
sky that was above if you flew high
enough

  cafe noir mr blaine now heres
the agreement if youd care to glance
over it quite usual and ordinary and

if youll just sign-here- he

glanced up whats that boy

  call for mr blaine

  in a moment said grewgerry
frowning

  its urgent sir this way please
little mr blaine being easily led
succumbed to this uniformed urge and
followed in bewilderment still clinging
to his napkin as to a life preserver a
stout pleasant-featured gentleman met
him in the shadow of a palm in the
lobby

  a colloquy which mr blaine could
not hear ensued between the boy and
this pleasant-faced gentleman

  i got him sir they were just get-
ting him to sign something

  good grief  he hadnt-

  no sir i stuck by until he came
along

  good lad got any use for a coupla
dollars and not a word to any one
see id not like to appear in it these
fellows keep more or less within the
law

  very good sir

  hello did you drop that

  where -sir

  over there by the pillar

  the boy stooped and picked up a
small envelope it was marked to
the house detective

  i should give it to him said mr
philibus somebody mustve dropped
it-perhaps purposely dont mention
i suggested so i dont think he likes
me so well

  the boy grinned and was off like a
shot

  bright lad said mr philibus
ah mr blaine im sorry to keep you
waiting and indeed to disturb you at
dinner but i happened to be dining near
your table to-night and i wondered if
youd forgive my having a word with
you

  the bell hop meanwhile crushing
the two-dollar bill affectionately in his
hand and transferring it to a slit that
evidently made connection with a
pocket set out immediately on the house
detectives trail he was a bright boy
quick to make money and slow to spend
it who could size up the financial inten-
tions of a patron with amazing tech-
nique who knew the value of a frank
eye and a silent tongue who could teach
diplomats the nice nuances of accom-
modating oneself to compromises and
who in due time if not hung would
doubtless rise high by other means

  letter for you he told the house
detective who was passing a friendly
and boastful word with a telephone
operator who just having turned over
her duties to a successor was powder-
ing her nose and remembering that the
house detective-even if he had a larg-
ish nose and a small mind-was a man
and seemed willing to spend money on
a girl if encouraged his name of
course was against him one could go
only so far with a man named croocrab
mrs croocrab the little croocrabs
not if she knew it
mr philibus-thousand-dollar man



  whered you get it

  found it on the floor

  floor where

  the lobby over that way

  how did it come there 

  ask it i saw it and picked it up
the blonde was becoming impatient
blondes can be like that they like
gentlemen to be gentlemen

  guess ill move along she said
hold up cried mr croocrab
sorry kiddo-just a matter of busi-
ness 

  the blonde pouted properly done
it was effective mr croocrab felt his
heart turn over he forgot the letter
or rather held it fiddling with it play-
fully

  girlie he said im a plain-spoken
man i dont mind saying i like you
well id hate to have you say it if
it hurt

  dont be snappy with poppa said
mr croocrab humorously baby if
i could only cop that coin i was talking
to a guy about to-day wed step pretty
you and me a thousand bucks
theres the paper see good descrip-
tion of him black hair and mustache
-black as the devil-fair size scar over
right cheek curved like a crescent can
you beat it  thats a give-away-a
scar like that was he within a hun-
dred miles i dont mind sayin i could
spot this bird like a shot but theres
no luck that way

  some dick with half my brainsll get
that coin way out in the woollies chap
i was chinnin with to-day says what
if this bird was right in the hotel itd
be a good place to hide thats brains
eh the way some people let their
chins wag would paralyze you baby
im a man of few words deeds not
words is the motto i was brung up on
since infancy baby if i ever land any-
thing like this-he hit the paper-you
and mell step a cake walk to the altar
and shuffle names

  the blondes eyes were fixed upon

him with the horrid fascination of one
seeing visiting cards with croocrab
on them the vision held her silent
for the moment mr croocrab con-
tinued  if i could lay a single finger
on this bird hed look cheap-cheap all
right

  mr croocrabs finger as it happened
was at that moment poking open the let-
ter he had forgotten it was a me-
chanical movement as was the pulling
forth of the letter inside

 a queer look overcame him he
paled the words moved before him
like living things

  watch your step the thousand-dollar-on-
his-head man is in your hotel if you want to
be in on this look for instructions under the
fifth palm in peacock alley

one interested in your career

  it was on delicately scented paper
the hand was apparently a feminine
scrawl mr croocrab felt at once
elated and faint he waved a hand at
the blonde

  gotta go he said chokingly see
you again girlie im on the trail of
money

  he moved off

  the blonde flirted her head

  yeah she said to her reflection in
her purse mirror on the trail of
money is good the big boob got a let-
ter from some dame crab is good
hes fishy all right

  the house detective however had no
thoughts to waste on her now a thou-
sand dollars was in prospect and the
prestige which such a capture would
give him desire ran ahead of his in-
telligence this might very well be a
poor joke on some ones part it was
like a treasure hunt being sent to the
fifth palm in peacock alley the al-
ley as it was popularly known ran
from the end of the lobby in narrow
splendor to the dining room on either
side were luxurious chairs and couches
on which one might sit at meal hours
and watch the great and the near-great

keeper

  finding the fifth palm mr croo-
crab had little difficulty in discovering
a further note thrust out of sight but
easily revealing itself to the initiate

  he tore it open and read

  room no  knock before entering and
watch for further instructions one thousand
dollars hangs on it	an admirer

  mr croocrab placing his large nose
against the paper sniffed again identi-
fying that delicate scent an admirer
some lady who desired to help him
straightening his shoulders and put-
ting on an air of extreme efficiency and
courage lest the lady be watching from
some seclusion he strode down peacock
alley and sought the room clerk

  whos no  he asked

   just taken

  name demanded mr croocrab
hoarsely

  name of blaine said the clerk
why whats up

  but mr croocrab had departed he
was heading for the elevator just
taken there must be souiething in
this after all

  he stepped into a waiting elevator

  third floor said mr croocrab im-
periously

  little mr blaine sat on the least com-
fortable chair in a room so luxuriously
appointed that at first he could do noth-
ing but stare at the splendor and mur-
mur to himself

 my gumdrops if only martha
could see this my gumdrops if it
dont beat all

  behind this perhaps superficial won-
der whirled a maze of conflicting emo-
tions which not being able either to
catalogue or subdue he pushed from
him in the last ten minutes things had
happened to him here he was in un-
disputed possession of this splendid
room and his bag his galoshes his um-
brella his second-best suit his picture

of martha-tinted-his nightwear and
his toilet accessories were all in a fifth-
floor room in browns commercial and
family hotel seven blocks away

  he could still hear the quiet convinc-
ing voice of the pleasant-faced gentle-
man stating

  mr blaine- you will forgive my in-
terference in your affairs but you are
about to be fleeced by men too crooked
to be crooks i dont ask you to take
my word i do ask-but are you room-
ing in this hotel

  no sir said mr blaine weakly

im at browns-

  oh my dear sir oh my dear sir
the pleasant gentleman had protested
wont do at all you must move in
here immediately you must meet men
like these on their own level a man
of your intelligence mr blaine will
see that at once let me recommend
either room  or  all the upper
fourteens have a good view im in 
myself ill wait here while you book
it and do make haste theres not a
moment to lose

  it was useless for mr blaine to pro-
test his protests against life had never
been heeded much and this nice gen-
tleman was evidently his friend

  you book said the gentleman
right over there and say nothing
why-except that you are changing your
hotel theyll send for your things
later if you wish but hurry please
these gentlemen who wish to fleece you
will be out of the dining room any mo-
ment and you must be prepared to meet
them in a proper background a man
of your evident intelligence mr blaine
can see that right away

  properly pleased at this fair esti-
mate mr blaine suffered his feet to
carry him to the desk

   said the room clerk um-
taken im afraid  yes thats a
good room nice view as you say and
vacant you want your luggage sent
for
mr philibus-thousand-dollar man



  he struck a bell mr blaine placing
on the page of the register open for
him a signature that would have wiped
out his and marthas savings had he
written it a short time before when re-
quested meekly followed the boy to
the elevator he looked round for the
pleasant-faced gentleman who had
tipped him off to this but could see him
nowhere a slight perturbation filled
him a hesitation but with this uni-
formed juvenile barging on ahead there
was no drawing back

  so here he was

  it was all very confusing but not
finally unpleasant he only wished
martha could see this room a gentle
breeze of early summer moved to him
through the open window which had
two advantages a far view over a pub-
lic square now spattered with lights in
the dusk and the iron security of a fire
escape that continued up above and led
down below martha had said to be
sure and locate the fire escape first off
and to have his trousers and slippers
handy at night

  the soft wind came pleasantly in at
the window and then suddenly un-
believingly and terrifying it was borne
in upon mr blaine that something more
than early summer air had come in the
window

  make no outcry said a cool voice
not a hair of your head will be hurt
if you keep cool and do as i say

  mr blaine stricken beyond the point
of vocalization his few hairs standing
up on his baldish pate gave a look
and fainted away and at that mo-
ment a gentle knocking sounded outside
his door

  the knuckles of house detective
croocrab having achieved nothing by
gentleness became more insistent and
this failing he called the floor man-
ageress and opened the door with the
master key

  imperiously bidding the lady of the
keys to stand aside out of danger mr

croocrab made a cautious but impres-
sive entrance to find as he thought a
little and most unimpressive man asleep
in a chair a moment later the true
situation was revealed

  water brandy stimulants or-
dered mr croocrab with quick intelli-
gence naw hold on the guys com-
ing round

  little mr blaine blinked up into the
face of the detective and seeing what
he did was about to faint away again
when the sight of the floor manageress
with a glass of water revived him mrs
scruton the manageress reminded him
of martha she was at once efficient
and homely

  mr blaine made sounds in his
throat eventually he managed words
a man he said through the
window off the fire escape

  mr croocrab caught the victim un-
gently by the shoulder

  quick describe him

  dark said mr blaine waving his
hands as if to push the mental vision
away very dark and a terrible
scar on his cheek horrible

  lovely amended mr croocrab
eagerly he dashed to the window
against the steel blue of the sky the
fire escape hung in uncompromising
ugliness perhaps it struck mr croo-
crab as sinister for he hung back then
very cautiously peered out sufficient
light enabled him to see that nothing
noteworthy menaced one in the length
between here and the roof so cau-
tiously he swung a leg out and let his
body follow little mr blaine stag-
gering forward but remaining at a dis-
creet distance stood watching this exit
and wringing his hands

  encouraged by the fact that no shots
or other dangers met him mr croocrab
-not liking the darkness below-chose
to go above and if there had been any
hesitation in this course it would have
been swept aside by a sudden call from
above him

  help help help

  startled he turned his eyes upward
and beheld from a window above a
tousled head outthrust

  with instant courage mr croocrab
responded running up the intervening
flight of iron steps he flung himself
into the room through the window
opened widely to him from which the
human presence had now gone as he
effected his entrance he heard the slam
of a door and was confronted with a
gentleman in pajamas and dressing
gown who cried

  gone

  gone

a dark man with a scar i saw
that very clearly as he passed that mir-
ror there he came in the window
the detective raced to the door and
flung it open

  which way

  i couldnt say he slammed the
door right in front of me

  mr croocrab running up and down
a little like an overheated hen made in-
vestigation hither and yon inquiring of
maids of elevator boys of bell hops
then returning inquired

  what did he do he came in the

window-

  and went directly to the door id
got into my night things a bit early and
had been lying on the bed a few min-
utes before all this happened i-

  why cried mr croocrab its
you

  sure its me said mr philibus
with ungrammatical humility and then
aggrievedly if that isnt the guy that
the thousand dollars is offered for ill
eat my dressing gown i told you
didnt i he might hide around here
yeah said mr croocrab ruminat-
ingly so you did how did you get
that way 

  mr philibus looked the detective
squarely in the eye

  between you and me he confided
i saw something that looked like him

once before i spoke to you that way
only you know how it is-its hard to
believe that kind of thing but i
thought it was no harm hinting it to
you say this place seems full of
crooks i saved a little country chap
from your friend grewgerry just now
got him away and suggested he take a
room here hes in  or -one or
the other im going to watch out for
him see im going to keep my eye on
him whats the matter

  mr croocrab choked

  

  is that where he is asked mr
philibus

  thats where the dark guy with the
scars just been in to scare the wits out
of him

  no cried mr philibus is it pos-
sible  poor little fellow hell think
im putting one over on him how did
you know

  got a note from a lady i guess
said mr croocrab tipped me off to
go to  theres something he de-
clared intelligently fishy about this
mr philibus threw up his hands
fishy it beats hannah the
place must be full of crooks look
here he said eagerly can i help
you ive laid eyes on this dark chap
with the scar and after all theres a
thousand in it for some one

  mr croocrab nodded hesitantly he
was seeing the little blonde below step-
ping with him to the altar and he didnt
like the dea of a fifty-fifty split with

this chap however-

  all right he said what had we
better do first

  thats for you to say said mr
philibus graciously conceding mr
croocrabs professional status but i
feel i ought to look up little mr blaine
in  and apologize or something
what a thing to happen

  ill go with you said mr croo-
crab

  do you suppose grewgerrys putting
mr philibus-thousand-dollar man



one over or anything asked mr phil-
ibus i dont trust that man even
that reward id like to see the color
of his money

  that agreed the detective his eyes
gleaming aint so bad an idea either
hes a slick guy all right

  mr grewgerry and his companions
having been left at the table by mr
blaine at the moment when the latter
was ready for the plucking had their
moment of nervousness the idea that
anybody in this world save those seek-
ing a victim should want little mr
blaine was preposterous their eyes
at first concentrated dismally on the
dotted line still lacking the signature
of mr blaine were raised at last in
specualtive inquiry

  hell be back said grewgerry
but uncomfortably they watched
the door well go and see he added
at last they searched the lobby they
made inquiries of a clerk why yes
sir mr blaine has gone up to his
room

  room repeated mr grewgerry
his brows agitated his room why

hes stopping at-

  he has just booked here mr
blaine is in  sir front boy
show these gentlemen to 

  little mr blaine was still undergo-
ing severe palpitations of the heart
when his visitors were announced he
regarded them as a man might creatures
of his past suddenly summoned up mr
grewgerry with his acute perception
leaped at once to the only logical con-
clusion

  mr blaine i am sorry you are
ill you have been taken ill you
have had to take a room

   mr blaine grasped at the
word it expressed so many things he
felt at remembrance of his terrible
experience at sight of these men who
would have his signature for his and
marthas money

  do sit down urged mr grewgerry
blandly is it your heart mr blaine
mr blaine gulped and spoke the
first words that occurred

  i have been held up

  held up

  a man a terrible criminal in my
window mr blaine waved an arm
feebly a dark man with a scar on
his face

  grewgerry leaped to his feet
what he roared tell me where
is he where did he go

  a voice spoke from the doorway
none had heard a quick preliminary
knock nor the opening of the door

  he came up the fire escape and in
my window said mr philibus calmly
hello mr grewgerry i think youre
likely at any time to have to turn over
that thousand-dollar reward

id give it gladly roared mr
grewgerry facing the intruders
fiercely to lay hands on that fellow
cash asked mr philibus mildly
cash roared mr grewgerry
theres danger in it said mr
philibus id like to see the color
of the money before i risked my neck
on fire escapes and perhaps get
plugged eh croocrab

  the house detectives face bright-
ened

  sure thats only fair mr grew-
gerry if you really mean to put this
up- he rubbed his hands a lit-
tle he felt it would be inspiring to
see the actual thousand before under-
taking further action mr croocrab
had a great respect for his own skin
grewgerry glared

  you dont trust me eh all right
graham lemme your pen ill write a
check theyll cash it for me below
the office know me well enough

  the office indeed proved obliging
mr grewgerry returned to display a
thick pile of twenties and tens that made
mr croocrabs head swim

  theres one thing we mustnt for-


detective story magazine

get suggested mr philibus gently
im not a prophet or the son of one
but ill wager my last shirt to a de-
cayed onion that crook isnt far off yet
mr grewgerry i shouldnt be sur-
prised if hes looking at that wad of
yours right now sir by jove i was
sure i saw him-just now-at the win-
dow  mr philibus was both excited
and truthful having caught his own re-
flection there

  every one with instant accord looked
toward that window in which the wanted
man had come the darkness held a
brooding and sinister suggestion of evil
little mr blaine made throaty cries of
alarm

  let him just try and get it
snapped grewgerry i only ask the
chance to try conclusions with him
again

  and im here supplemented mr
croocrab with due modesty that guy
dont put nothin over me while im alive
and in my right mind no sir

  mr philibus coughed slightly behind
his hand he remained for a moment
gravely in thought

  suppose he said slowly i ask
your advice mr croocrab suppose
we were to bait the trap if mr grew-
gerry will risk his money for a short
while with mr blaine-you of course
anticipate me mr croocrab

  mr croocrab felt flattered but dumb
then the thing dawned on him

  he chuckled

  thats just my idea he said
well turn over this money to mr
blaine-or mr grewgerry will as if it
was a business deal-see-and then mr
grewgerry follows us out here into the
hall mr blaine steps in here and
counts the money careful and puts it in
his pocket if that dont bring the rat
out of his hole im a dumb-bell

  mr grewgerry was ready for any
expedient

  little  mr blaine made bleating
sounds but a bit like a man in a dream

accepted the money with trembling fin-
gers and as they left him sat staring
at it like a wooden indian

  now i said mr philibus thought-
fully had better go back to bed the
fellow came through my window be-
fore and he may again i better give
no indication anything has happened
ill just lie there peacefully again with
the window open croocrab you might
post somebody outside my door in case
i need help ill lock the door as he
might try to use my room as an escape
again but it might be as well to have
reenforcements outside say a boy
who could summon help from you be-
low 

  sure said croocrab ill put a
bell hop on it

  mr philibus nodded

  they say lightning never strikes
twice in the same place but this chaps
a bold bad un or i miss my guess and
its as well we should be prepared

  shouldnt we have some one watch-
ing on the fire escape said the detec-
tive

  mr philibus looked at him in patient
reproach

  if i were a crook he said simply
id postpone operations if somebody
was sitting waiting to pinch me on the
fire escape

  something in that agreed mr
croocrab quickly well well be all
set for the first sign of alarm from mr
blaine right outside his door well
be

  once inside his room mr philibus
crawling for a moment into bed as if
in support of the cause of truth and hon-
esty slipped presently out the far side
and over his pajamas drew on an old
pair of trousers a coat and a muffler to
protect his neck standing for a mo-
ment before his mirror he performed
an operation that a lightning-change art-
ist-and indeed he was one-might
envy
mr philibus-thousand-dollar man



  a few mysterious passes with his
hands on the tips of whose fingers was
a preparation of his own perfecting
made him sallow looking a similar addi-
tional operation provided lines to his
face that lent a gauntness and a final
one gave the similitude of a scar across
his right cheek bone taking from a
carefully locked but unobtrusive and
rather battered suit case a hat with wig
attached he pulled it on his head and
became in every sense a dark and rather
sinister person

  all this had been a matter almost
more of seconds than minutes pulling
on a pair of old boots over socks into
which the ends of his genteel pajamas
were thrust he moved softly to the win-
dow  the bell hop might have sharp
ears there was fortunately no keyhole
aperture for the fellow to be curious
with then he stepped onto the fire es-
cape

  the night was graciously dark now
he maneuvered with care and arrived
outside 

  peering through the lighted window
he could see little mr blaine sitting like
a rabbit paralyzed by impending dan-
ger the ears of the little man fairly
stood up and his hair seemed on the
verge of declaring a sympathetic upris-
ing in his hands clutched tightly as
if it were stage money and he a novice
upon whom the curtain had gone up un-
expectedly was that fat wad of tens and
twenties one thousand dollars-mr
josiah j grewgerrys promised reward
for the apprehension of a dark gentle-
man with a scar

  mr philibus feeling a certain ten-
derness toward little mr blaine hesi-
tated in his course then thinking of
the widows and orphans the gentle
souls of every sex who had suffered to
provide themselves with handsomely en-
graved and worthless certificates for oil
shares and mr grewgerry and his asso-
ciates with this thousand he girded
himself and stooping picked up a

stage prop he had previously planted
conveniently to hand under the window
on the fire escape

  little mr blaine wondering why he
had ever left martha and embarked on
this city venture conscious of the wad
of bills in his hand conscious of the
support of the men who waited outside
the door was still more and in fact su-
premely conscious of that window his
gaze was riveted on it

  his tongue explored the length of his
dry lips and suddenly his tongue
seemed to get stuck hard and fast be-
tween his lips

  on the end of a thin stick of sorts
propelled by an unseen hand a largish
oblong of cardboard had appeared it
said

silence

and

 you will not be harmed

  mr blaines mind compassed all the
events of an innocent life in a moment
of time he thought of how he had said
nasty things to martha about her mar-
ried sister and how once he had thrown
shoes at a neighbors cat and he decided
to cling to life he stared with horror
at the slow cautious entrance of a dark
man with a scarred cheek this sec-
ond sight of him was no more pleasing
than the first he was coming nearer
it was too much for mr blaine his
mouth opened to make outcry instead
some black wave smote the back of his
neck and the bank notes drifting from
him to the floor mr blaine for the
second time fainted dead away

  mr philibus stooping to pick up the
bills hesitated it was easy now too
easy he had counted on an alarm at
the least it was desirable that others
besides little mr blaine should see and
recognize the criminal

  mr philibus looked up sharply and
suddenly reaching out an arm to the
table near by he swept from it the small
bronze statue of a lightly clad lady bear-


detective story magazine

ing aloft a lighted torch she lit on the
floor with a report just like a revolver
shot

  instantly the door burst open mr
croocrab scenting both danger and a
thousand dollars led the van but cau-
tiously revolver in hand

  there he is

  the shout came from four throats
simultaneously

  the dark gentleman with the scar re-
garded them mockingly from the win-
dow his head within but his body safely
outside

  shoot cried grewgerry dead or
alive

  the window camfe down with a crash
putting only the insecurity of a pane be-
tween mr philibus and his antagonists
mr croocrabs revolver went up but
before he could discipline a hand agi-
tated by a brain swimming with thou-
sand-dollar agitations the pane was
shattered from the outside and through
the jagged aperture came a mocking
laugh

  croocrab shot forward grewgerry at
his heels

  mind the glass shouted mr croo-
crab oh the devil stand back

  reaching out he thrust the window
up springing from a further shower of
splinters cursing with emphatic pro-
testation at a cut in his wrist next
moment he was out upon the fire es-
cape

  got away he moaned that fel-
lows room maybe hes gone that way
again

  with grewgerry following he shot
up the escape and in the open window
of 

  hello cried a sleepy voice from
the bed what the-

  the man with the scar cried croo-
crab he didnt come in here

  mr philibus stared blinking sleepily

  id have known if he did he said
grinning

  suddenly josiah j grewgerry-who

as the world knew to its sorrow-was
no fool cried

 i believe you-

  he did not complete the remark
dashing to the bed he threw back the
clothes

  i say protested mr philibus

  mr grewgerry drew back abashed
mr philibus stout body was displayed
only in futuristic pajamas he appealed
to mr croocrab whats biting our
friend here

  dunno said the house detective
blankly he reproached mr grew-
gerry you know sir it dont do to
disturb hotel guests that way

  for two cents sir added mr phil-
ibus now blinking himself properly
awake as any one could see id bash
in your other eye by the by wheres
little mr blaine have you left him
to the mercy of this crook 

  gently mr croocrab explained

  mr philibus clucked a sympathetic
tongue

 fainted well now and mr
grewgerrys thousand dollars gone a
nice name this hotel will get mr croo-
crab if this kind of thing gets about
if i were you id get mr blaine packed
off home its no kind of a place for
him anyway-not with so many crooks
around

  so many mr croocrab was blank
again

  i saved mr blaine from one already
to-night said mr philibus placidly i
got him away about the time he was
going to sign his poor little legacy away
for nonexistent oil it was i as he
will no doubt tell you when you ques-
tion him who suggested he take a room
here and go at this matter quietly so
you see said mr philibus humbly i
feel quite guilty about what happened
to him afterward he turned to mr
grewgerry who had halted in his in-
vestigation of the room to absorb this
last comment is the gentleman look-
ing for something
mr philibus-thousand-dollar man



  mr grewgerry drew nearer the bed
and swore in an ungentlemanly fashion

  i believe youre a crook he began
but mr philibus interrupted

  i know youre one he said gently
i dont like anything about you i
dont like your face i dont like your
morals i dont like you long nose i
dont like your bald head i dont like
the way you come in disturbing a gen-
tlemans sleep in fact let me warn
you that unless mr croocrab takes
you away something nasty might hap-
pen to you i can stand so much-and
no more get out now go and find
your thousand-dollar crook i wouldnt
raise a hand any more to help catch him
-for you not a finger get out
im sleepy and if you try to trick
little blaine with any of your slick work
 wont answer for myself get out
of here

  mr grewgerry mumbling things not
nice for a gentlemans ears withdrew
together with mr croocrab

  woof said mr philibus softly 
mr grewgerry swung around de-
cided he had imagined something and
before mr philibus baleful glance re-
tired closing the door for a long time
mr philibus lay staring up at the ceil-
ing and chuckling a little to himself

  then making sure that no one was
at the window or on the fire escape he

drew from under the mattress a coat
and pair of trousers and a hat with wig
attached

  ruined im afraid he said dole-
fully regarding the latter ah well
lucky he said old nosey didnt look
too far hadnt time to clean the basin
up he went over now and took from
water-still warm-standing in the
basin a wash cloth carefully rinsing
from it a dusky look that clung to it
and some stains that might easily have
come from the removal of an artificial
scar

  quick work old boy approved mr
philibus gazing in his mirror but
worth it in more ways than this

  he took from the pocket of the dis-
carded trousers a fat wad of bills in
tens and twenties

  its not robbery he said its a
reward he offered it for the chance
to get his hands on this awful crook who
bashed him up before but what a pity
i couldnt have closed the other eye for
him ah well

  taking the money with him he
climbed into bed shut off the night light
that was burning and pleasantly antic-
ipated the delights of that slumber

  as the dear old blacksmith said
murmured mr philibus sleepily
 something attempted something
done has earned a nights repose

 an extra trip for tony

  by c wiles hallock

               tony ferroni the terrible wop

  prowling ye olde antiquarian shoppe

                    lifted a jade statuette

                 tony was vicious and tony was smart

  tony cracked safes when he raided the mart

                 but tony was wop and his weakness was art

                  and jade is worth trouble to get

  tony was proud of his jade-lifting job

                  bragged of the trick to his pals of the mob

                  tony was clever but rash

                 mobsters know -how to make use of a fool

  mobsters dont care about art as a rule

                    except for its value in cash

  tony soon found what a fool he had been

  tony was warned by the mob to kick in

                  what did they care about art

                 well they cared some a reward would be paid

                  no questions asked for that green chunk of jade

  ten grand-and no cops taking part

                 tony kicked in twas a blow to his pride

                 why be perverse though risk taking a ride

                 mobsters are desperate men

                 they got the reward there the matter should drop
                 but jade was the weakness of tony the wop

                 straight back to ye olde antiquarian shoppe
                    sneaked tony and stole it again

  moment that his gun was reposing in a
  downtown pawnshop beads of per-
  spiration pearled on his forehead and
  he felt suffocated fearing to breathe
  this was the end caught like a rat
  in a trap

   then he laughed why that was
 what it was rats this dilapidated
 old lodging house was infested from
 cellar to garret he breathed a deep
 sigh of relief and shuffled over to the
  window again a great bolt of light-
 ning greeted him and he recoiled in
 terror electricity the yawning
 mouth of hell

    above a loud burst of thunder the
  big clock struck the half hour foxy
  tottered back and sank down weakly
  into the battered chair what was
  tommy doing was he cursing his

fate no tommy wasnt that kind
probably praying but had he told
had he in repentance confessed to the
identity of his partner foxys name
-an assumed one-wouldnt matter
he had never been caught never been
mugged or finger printed but there
was the scar

  his whole left ear was gone ampu-
tation had been necessary two years be-
fore when infection had set in-infec-
tion from a gunshot wound inflicted by
an officers pistol that had been his
closest escape yes he had deemed it
wise to remain on vacation until-
tommy was gone

  he fumbled in his pockets for cig-
arettes something clattered to the
floor as he withdrew the package he
bent over and picked it up twirling it
in his restless fingers his lucky coin
a quarter so old that the luster had long
since worn away and the date become
indistinguishable for six long years
he had carried it and had never been
caught

  he laughed funny how a guy
would get such ideas but the fact re-
mained that rather than spend it he
had foregone the purchase of cigarettes
earlier in the evening he looked rue-
fully inside the pack only one left
he started to draw it out dropped it
back drew it out and lit it

  deeply he inhaled and relaxed in the
chair returning the quarter to its ac-
customed place in the side pocket of
his trousers the nicotine soothed his
frayed nerves reassuring him what
had been the matter with him any-
way one would think he was getting
white-livered

  he leaned back and puffed content-
edly everything would be jake to-
morrow with the coast clear once
more it would be a simple matter to
get the money to redeem his gun then
back to zanesville where hed hidden
for the past nine months and that
swell job he had spotted
he needed it



  the cigarette fell from his fingers
the clock was striking eleven

  he sat perfectly still and counted the
strokes when it had finished he
stooped to recover the cigarette straight-
ened up and stared at the door un-
mistakably those were human footsteps
he heard somebody was pausing out-
side his door his throat constricted
painfully as he strained forward to
listen he breathed a malediction
against the reduced circumstances that
had forced him into renting such a trap
-a room with no lock on the door
there wasnt even a fire escape

  there came a loud knock upon the
door	

  springing to his feet he darted to
one side the chair held menacingly
above his head hed never give up
without a struggle hed go down
fighting a strangling sob rose in his
throat why had he ever left zanes-
ville to come to this accursed place
hed been safe the whole week and
now on the very last night-

  the knock was repeated swaying
weakly he finally found his voice

  whos there

  say brother can you spare a
match 

  foxy recognized the voice of a
roomer from across the hall setting
the chair down he opened the door a
few inches and peered out

  just came in the other explained
went to light the gas and found i
didnt have a match thought maybe
you could spare one thanks sorry
to bother you

   s all right foxy mumbled as the
man walked away

  he closed the door and propped the
chair under the knob then returning
to the cot hesank down haggard and
spent perspiration trickled down his
lean cheeks and dripped from his chin
how crazy hed been ever to come to
columbus after all he could have
waited a few hours longer to see the

newspapers theyd give more details
too than the extras

  eleven thirty standing again before
the window water splashing in through
the broken pane he noticed that the
corner street lamp was out everything
was shrouded in darkness except now
and then when a bolt of lightning zig-
zagged across the heavens

  they probably were starting the death
march about now the crown of tom-
mys head would be shaved his trou-
sers leg slit wonder if he was hys-
terical as on that other night and
most important what would pass his
lips before the switch was pushed in

  a sudden crash of thunder broadcast
its fury followed by a wriggling streak
of flames that to foxy resembled a
monstrous hissing snake

  heavens he whispered what a
night-what a way-to pass out

  at five minutes past midnight foxy
descended the squeaky stairs and started
down the street the worst part of the
storm was over but a keen nipping
drizzle was still falling foxy shivered
and drew his thin jacket closer he
rapped out an oath as the water on the
sidewalk seeped in through the worn
soles of his low-cut shoes

  crossing the first intersection he
saw that the street lamp-the one he
had watched from his attic window-
had been blown down and was lying in
the street broken into a thousand frag-
ments two blocks beyond he pulled
his cap lower on the left side of his
face and turned the corner onto high
crossing over he started down the left
side of the street toward the state
house closely hugging the stores at his
left

  fifteen minutes passed

  extra extra extra

  the newsboys were appearing now
like buzzards circling over a heap of
carrion their raucous yells ringing
shrilly above the abating din of traffic


detective story magazine

  extra extra all bout the lec-
trocution  extra paper mister 

  foxy gave the boy his last nickel and
turned back up high reading as he
hurried on toward deeper shadows

   thomas walters twenty-year-old cincinnati
gunman went to his death in the electric chair
shortly before midnight last night convicted
of the fatal shooting of a cincinnati night
watchman last february in an attempted hold-
up he was strapped in the chair at  and
pronounced dead seven minutes later

  foxy skimmed hastily over the de-
tails as he hurried along only one
thing he was interested in ah

   although walters was known to have had an
accomplice due to the different caliber bul-
lets in the watchmans body he went calmly
to his death with sealed lips regarding the
identity of his companion

  foxy caressed the newspaper and
chuckled safe at last tommy had
remained faithful to the end he
should have known that the kid was
that kind yes hed have made a swell
partner too bad

  he squared his shoulders and strode
forward at a brisker gait it was sweet
to be alive and free no more hiding
no more attic rooms back to zanes-
ville for him and that easy job if
only he had a smoke

  his gaze fell on a cigarette butt lying
beside the curb it was a long one-
not over a third smoked he bent over
and picked it up it was soaked no
matter hed dry it over the gas jet in
his room but he needed his gun he
must have money to redeem it maybe
now on some dark street-

  hey there wait a minute

  foxy whirled quickly around and
gaped

  lord he cried a copper

  in the mad sprint that followed the
officer was no more than fifteen paces
behind cursing viciously at this un-
timely encounter foxy sped onward
wildly recklessly aimlessly a hys-

terical sob rose in his throat that was
dry as parchment

  tommy the double crosser he had
told after all the dirty bulls had
tricked him

  he knew without turning that his
pursuer was gaining if only he had
his gun ignoring the thundering com-
mand to halt he exerted his last ounce
of strength in the desperate effort to
escape the newspaper went flying

  a dark alley suddenly confronted
him and he dived for the entrance be-
hind him as he dashed blindly through
the inky passage he heard the shrill
blast of the policemans whistle with-
out pausing in flight he turned and
peered back he groaned at his un-
armed helplessness as his nemesis came
charging a perfect target against the
illuminated background of high street

  and then another uniform appeared
a choking sob of despair escaped him
they were closing in although his
strength was ebbing he refused to ad-
mit defeat panic lent wings to his
feet as he shot through the welcome
darkness like a bullet he swore aloud
as he landed with both feet in a puddle
and the water gushed through his soles
and squashed between his toes

  he took a quick leap forward tripped
on something and fell headlong
reaching out he groped blindly fren-
ziedly for a handhold his hand came
in contact with something and held

  the two officers flashed their lights
on the prostrate form and turned it
over	

  electrocuted by heaven

  guess youre right sergeant that
water hole and fallen power line made
a perfect contact by the looks

  the sergeant knelt down and scru-
tinized the features more closely
know who he is

  never saw im before sergeant
didnt have anything on im either
only he started to run for dear life
he needed it



when i called to im thought then sidewalk guess he didnt see it but i
that he might be a yegg he stooped did he reached into his pocket by
and went through the pockets no the looks of his clothes i figured the
weapons on im though guess he was poor devil needed it so i called to im
afraid of bein run in on a vagrancy i was goin to return it to im but he
charge	started runnin like the very devil was

  how did you happen to call to after im
him	he held out his hand in the palm

  well sir he stooped over to pick lay a dull obsolete quarter
up a cigarette butt and something fell yeah the sergeant growled he
from his pocket and rolled onto the probably needed it

                                                                   

slave and master fight

cometimes a burglary job is a fifty-fifty proposition and then again one of
a pair is the boss it was a case of a master and a rebellious slave that put
the burglary job second in importance a short time ago the affair took place in
a new york apartment which the two men had entered for the purpose of robbing

    the occupant of the apartment was an elderly man living alone the burglars
had ransacked the place pretty thoroughly before he awoke from his slumbers the
hour being after two a m up to that time the loot only amounted to eight dollars
and a few miscellaneous articles

    tie him up commanded the head burglar his underling demurred he
discovered that the occupant of the apartment was old and had a withered arm
he was genuinely afraid of hurting him he wanted to leave him alone and make
a hurried exit but his leader was not to be disobeyed he felt he must have
obedience at any cost accordingly he picked up a bread knife and stabbed his
partner in the side

    from that moment onward it became a rough-and-tumble fight while the old
man shouted help murder police the entire street became alarmed
the burglars suddenly decided to unite on at least one idea and that was to run
they dashed from the apartment which was on the first floor and disappeared
around the corner here they ran into the arms of a patrolman who grabbed
each by an arm and demanded to know why they were running

    cant you see asked the master burglar thinking quickly were
training

    what for asked the patrolman unconvinced

    take a look at this bum he answered crooking his finger at his late an-
tagonist hes big jack from the garden

    the policeman was still not convinced he continued asking embarrassing
questions and his captives were squirming with real anxiety for they did not
know at what moment the yelling street crowd would appear around the very
corner they had come why were they running at three oclock in the morning
because the streets were clear and the air purer was the burglars answer but
still the officer tarried just then residents of the neighborhood they had so
successfully eluded came panting up and identified the men as the two burglars

    the prisoners were taken to the police station when it was discovered that one
of them was wounded he was hurried to a near-by hospital

  cases will be discussed in the department with or without the illustrations of course
  under no circumstances will the identity of the persons concerned be revealed

      every care will be taken to return specimens of handwriting but it is to be
 understood that miss spencer cannot be responsible for them

  p k m i wish that some of the
stage-struck people could hear you say
that if you had your life to live over
again you wouldnt go in for acting
it is true that once you are in it then
the bug has bitten you permanently
it isnt a life of ease and glamour is it
no it has its drawbacks just like any
other profession-and has more than
many

  there are a good many flourishes in
your writing and many curlicues

love of pleasure is pretty strong you
are humorous and full of fun so i
imagine you have a good time whatever
you do your writing runs downhill
somewhat and as i dont think you are
naturally a pessimistic person it must be
that you are not up to the standard in
health perhaps you were tired when
you wrote the letter or have just used
up your strength watch that as you
are not a strong person your t bars
are not the firm certain strokes of a
person with driving power and force

  r l k illinois yes accuracy and
precision are certainly shown in your
script you didnt need to tell me that
though i am glad you did as i like to
have these proofs of the truth of
graphology

  the even pressure uniform letter
what handwriting reveals



 i

formations spacing and margins and
the small writing all point to detail work
and scientific mentality you are well
fitted for your work

  you have a kind nature and are af-
fectionate but j-eserved there is more
power behind your will than is found
with most men who devote their lives to
sedentary work of a mental nature i
am sure that you could fill an executive
position with success

  r l pennsylvania well well
well i am rendered rather speechless
before your script it is taking me
some time to get over the first impres-
sion and try to discover the real you
down in under all that superficial arti-
ficiality

  first i must scold you about letting
your ego just roam around that way
do you mind if i am very frank with
you there is so much conceit ex-
pressed in your script that i just cant
keep from mentioning it even though
i know you will probably hate me for it
just look at those inflated loops-all out
of proportion-and making the impres-
sion of your personality and character
pretty bad you dont want to put your
worst foot forward all the time do you 
if not then i beg of you to become a
humble sincere and honest person
drop the artificial manners and the in-
sincere pose it does not become you
at all

  a more impractical person i dont
think i have ever seen so naturally you

would detest business-and business
would detest having you around im
sure you are not in line for any real
constructive work for you are not
thinking constructively or trying to make
the best of your mind you are day-
dreaming imagining-oh how your
imagination does work-but very little
real fundamental thinking or work do
you do the indolence indicated in your
script is appalling

  i suggest that you study design you
are capable of original creative work it
you can change your
habits

miss r g london england  after
the erratic script i just read i find your
writing like a calm after a storm you

are practical proper and sens

md

your emotions are disciplined and under
excellent control not that you havent
something to you for you have you
are one of those cool collected persons
who is efficient without being boring

  l b pennsylvania i am often
asked if physical disturbances can be
seen in the handwriting the state of
the nerves is reflected in ones script if
the physical disturbance has affected the
nervous system then the record is there
in the script-not of what has caused it
however sometimes a few intoxicat-
ing drinks will so upset the nervous sys-
tem that the evidence is quite visible in
the script and then again some people
could dissipate and overindulge in stimu-
lants and drugs to excess without show-
ing any sign in their writing it de-
pends upon the constitution of the
writer and the nature of the disease or
mental disturbance and period of time
involved how much the handwriting will
give them away

                         

  your writing young man is not nor-
mal right now i cant tell whether or
not this is a temporary condition but
you yourself will be able to judge that
if you are aware of the condition and
what is causing it whatever it is
your nervous system has been affected
guard your health the broken or
fractured letters the wavering lines un-
even pen pressure and jerky writing re-
veal a physical and mental disturbance

  v s o north dakota thank you
for using the india ink the blue ink
does not reproduce well in the magazine

  i dont think that your dreams are
pipe dreams at all i think they sound
very possible you have practically fin-
ished your training and if you go to
chicago and get a job in the commercial
art field you will certainly be able to
have your apartment and the arrange-
ment you speak about none of that is
impossible and i really think you should
do it at once and not stay in a small
place i dont know about art condi-
tions in chicago but i know there are
many opportunities here in new york

  your writing does not show unusual
skill or ability for art but enough to
warrant your going on with the work
your years of teaching have made their
mark on you so that you are more con-
ventional and more steneotyped than
the average artistic person you can
live that down however a little prac-
tical ability will never hurt an artist i

apple youve either got to
write another story about your notor-
ious character or tell us that hes dead
but apple perish the thought that this
last should be the sad sad truth we
realize that there are some wholl think
ill of us that we should harbor such a
thought-that we should long to learn
that mr chang escaped how he did
so and then what happened still is
it not wicked to wish any person dead
then too that man chang sure does
keep moving about and never lets any
one else stand still either and the
reader he or she cant help hustling
right along with chang and the rest of
them whoever they happen to be those
we mean who have got themselves tan-
gled up with him

  come apple is it crape or the open
road and adventure for chang

  dear editor after reading de-
tective story magazine for six long
years i am becoming rather disap-
pointed more so at every issue

  when friday comes i dash madly
to the nearest book store and buy an
issue of detective story magazine
open the cover to the contents page and
then-give you the very old dickens
why  because there is no story of mr
chang listed

  i am sure you want to give your read-
ers what they want so give us chang
lovers a break arrange to take a vote
for and against this heathen and allow
the votes to decide his fate fair eh

then in the meantime allow us to light
up the pipe open our book to a rafferty
or once in a while a crimson clown
story and i for one will gladly help pay
to keep a certain editor on the job

  come on editor lets ask these
folks who read headquarters chat how
they want to vote make mine for mr
chang rafferty and the crimson
clown

  it was through your chang apple
that w ray burrows  troup street
rochester new york got started read-
ing detective story magazine he
says

  dear editor i have just read mr
richards letter in the april th chat
and i heartily agree with his desire to
see a return of mr chang

  the chang stories of mr apple are
in a class with the fu manchu novels
of sax rohmer-fascinating thrilling
and intensely interesting i note that
you say many readers took a violent
dislike to them all right do they
need to be so selfish as to deprive thou-
sands of readers who want them of
the pleasure of reading exactly what
they like

  there are some stories that i like
much better than others but i figure
that other people will perhaps like
them better than i do and read them
and pass on to others so it seems to
me you should request apple to re-
vive them it was mr chang of scot-
land yard that first led me to buy
your magazine furthermore i know
of many readers who feel just as i do
if there are some who threaten to quit
if mr chang returns all right ill


detective story magazine

wager that those who want him far out-
number those who dont

  i am in favor of one serial three
or four novelettes and two short sto-
ries in each issue eliminate short sto-
ries in favor of the longer novelettes
also i think you could enlarge the
headquarters chat to four pages pub-
lishing the letters-say about six to
eight each week-in very small type
and making this department a more in-
formal get-together discussion of what
we like

realization that he profits most who serves best therefore we
spent millions of dollars in determining the wants of the reading
public and we supplied those wants we did not try to force our
own ideas of literature on any one

    the service rendered by the firm of street  smith is
a vital one through the media of weekly story papers maga-
zines and books we afforded mental relaxation entertainment and
a love for reading that could not be supplied by anything else

    therefore when we print on the covers of our magazines
the slogan read the best-street  smiths
magazines we sincerely believe that the advice is sound
our various publications are the best of their respective classes

when the white wolf turned sheriff

    tough hombres and bad citi-
zens felt uneasy and their hands
moved close to the butts of their
guns but honest men were not
afraid

    jim-twin allen-the white
wolf-outlaw tried his hand at
sheriffing when his brother jack
allen was laid up and unable to
attend to his duties and the
white wolf made a good job of
it-dealing out primitive justice
from the smoking muzzles of his
terrible six-guns

    the white wolf was known as a merciless killer relentless in his purpose
whenever he took the crimson trail of vengeance-but he was also a human
pathetic character who secretly longed for peace

    jim-twin allen the white wolf rides on glorious trails of adventure in
these galloping romances
