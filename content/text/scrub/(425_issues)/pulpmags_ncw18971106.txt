chapter i
avictim of a strange persecution

  marcus astorel millionaire middle-
aged corpulent ruddy-faced and anx-
ious-eyed sat one forenoon in the recep-
tion-rooni of liis suite in the palace ho-
tel san francisco impatiently drum-
ming his fingers on the little table in
front of him

  he was expecting a visitor

 the time was the latter part of
march

  ten oclock arrived and the visitor
presented himself

  it was nick carter

 he had arrived that morning from a
small town in the interior where he had
succeeded with chicks assistance in un-
masking a fiend in human shape

  the millionaire shook hands heartily
with the great detective

  i cant tel you how glad i am to see
you mr carter

  you have urgent need of my services
then

  yes before my arrival in california
two days ago i thought the case a most
pressing one to-day it has become a
matter of life and death with me

  mr astorels lips twitched in nervous
fear and he glanced uneasily at the door
opening into the corridor

  nick followed his eye and interpreting
the glance went to the door opened it
and peered out

  there is no one there he said
now then to business

  two months agobegan the million-
aire ray wife was abducted

  the abductor demanded ten thousand
dollars for her safe return to san fran-
cisco

  i paid the money in the manner stip-
ulated and my wife arrived at our home
on van ness avenue safe and sound

  two weeks later my only daughter
hester was abducted from mills semi-
nary in alameda county where she was
receiving the finishing touches to her ed-
ucation
nick carter avekkly

  and to-night you must turn up fifty
thousand dollars more or turn up your
toes  

  nick spoke half jestingly but astorel
shivered at the words

  yes lie said i must be prepared
for the loss of more money or the loss of
my life unless you are able to extricate
me from the terrible dilemma

  i will do my best and have the
faith to believe that mr dellman will not
succeed in his purpose 

   you will have a man with the cun-
ning of old satan to contend with

  the odds then will be in my favor
for satan would never be in sheol but for
a little mistake he once made

  nicks air of confidence inspired asto-
rel to remark quietly

  i believe you will succeed in spite of
the evil ability of dellman

  i admit his ability he must be able
indeed to have covered up his tracks so
well to have so arranged his evil pro-
gramme that although you know him to
be the man who has robbed you yet you
have no evidence to produce that would
warrant his arrest

  i never saw cunning and audacity so
queerly combined as they are in this
man said the broker

  he will show his audacity once too
often mr astorel nick went on i
like this case it attracts me

  the plan of campaign against the ene-
my was arranged and when astorel was
made acquainted with the line of attack
his astonishment thereat was equaled only
by  is admiration of the great detectives
strategical intelligence

  some hours after they had parted
nick went into the cafe royal in flood
building

  he was in search of albert dellman
he had not been seated more than five
minutes in one of the comfortable chairs
ranged alon the sides of the large hall
when the object of his search entered

  tall dark-featured handsome with
polished manners and a pleasant smile
he was a man calculated to make a favor-
able impression wherever he went or in
what society he might be cast

  nick gazed at him long and steadily
and noting certain lines about the
mouth together with other character in-
dications formed the correct conclusion
that albert dellman could commit a mur-
der with that smile of his and never
suffer from a perturbed conscience

  mentally he is as bright as a new
dollar thought nick but morally he
is an idiot 

  an acquaintance at one of the tables
greeted dellman effusively

  glad to see you he exclaimed
where have you been for the past
week missed you awfully at the club
must have you at the bulls-head dinner
to-morrow at the cliff now dont say no
old fellow for without your assistance the
affair must be a failure 

  dellman smiled in return showing as
he did so a set of firm white teeth

  i cant possibly oblige you lie an-
swered for to-morrow i shall be on my
way to los angeles

  what have you struck a windfall
not yet-composedly-but before
i start i expect to be better off finan-
cially than i am to-day 

   glad of it mr dellman for that tilt
of yours made the other day againt the
associated virginia must have cost you
a cool fifty thousand

  just that my boy to a dollar but i
shall recoup to-night beyond the shadow
of a doubt 

  wl you said nick to himself
now if i know anything about matters
and things connected with your case mr
albert dellman i should prophesy that
to-night will not help you out instead of
fift thousand dollars in that old tree back
of berkeley you will likely find a bottle
of soup 
nick carter weekly	

   dellman was on his way to a seat when
 struck by a sudden recollection he
 paused put liis hand to liis brow then
 wheeled quickly and started for the door

   but before he reached it a smart young
 man-a news peddler-entered with a
 bundle of papers under his arm

   heres yer bulletin post n report
 he cried out latest news from chili
 big jump in associated virginia-

  here boy give me a bulletin in-
 terrupted dellman

  after procuring a copy he made his
way to the open air

  a big jump in associated virginia
meant that he had missed the chance of
his life

  the other day when the stock went
down lie bad sold out at a great loss fear-
ing that the bottom of the concern would
fall out entirely if he held on

  he glanced at the list of the lucky
 ones in this new mining deal and sighed

  from the mining news he turned his
eye to the personals as was his daily
habit

   he started turned pale and then let
 fall a string of oaths when he read these

 lines

  among the passengers by the sum-
mer queen this afternoon for honolulu
was marcus astorel esq the well-
known broker who goes to the islands
for his health 

chapter ii

  preparing for the campaign

   the news peddler was chick

  as albert dellman with the paper in
 hand disappeared through the door
 chick looked at his superior and
 grinned knowingly

nick approached and bought a paper

  astorel got off did he he asked
 in a low voice

yes

follow dellman find out where he

goes and what he does between now and
four oclock then report to me

  where shall i find you

  at a sailors boarding-house on clay
street near the water front youll know
the place by the big woodeu eagle over
the entrance

  very well 

  chick was off without another word
the great detective went to the door
and watched the shadowed and the sliad-
ower until they were out of sight

  then he hastened to the palace hotel
where he remained an hour

  at four oclock he was at the sailors
lodging-house on clay street awaiting
the appearance of his brave and keen-
witted assistant

  chick was on time his honest features
aglow with excitement

  well said his chief

  followed mister man to a french
restaurant on dupont street fie went
into a private stall i went info the one
adjoining the partitions are low and i
managed to look down on him without
his becoming aware of the fact

  what did you see -
i saw him open the paper he bought
of me and read the mining and personal
columns several times over

  what was his manner

  he was pale and nervous at first but
when at last he put away the paper his
face had regained its ordinary color and
expression and he fell to on the raw oys-
ters he had ordered as cool as a cucum-
ber

  what do you infer

  that be has either dropped to our
game or has discovered a new way to cor-
ral the fifty thousand lie was counting on
for this evening 

  i dont think he suspects trickery
observed nick after a pause

  come to think of it i dont either
then he has concocted some new
scheme 
nick carter weekly

  against whom

  mrs astorel and her daughter
that ought to suit our arrangement 
it does for it is in the commission
of some new act of villainy that we must
hope to trap him and render him in fu-
ture powerless to work injury against
any one but himself what did he do
after finishing his oysters

  paid for them and walked out of the
restaurant

  where did he go

  to a saloon on dupont street fre-
quented by the sporting fraternity pugs
and their satellites principally i fol-
lowed him and saw him enter into earn-
est conversation with a tar flat bruiser
a fellow who has done time in san quen-
tin for robbery

  do i know him

  i should think you did its flat-
nosed batson who was run out of chi-
cago by the police at the time of the an-
archist excitement

  yes i do know him and i owe him
one for a headache he gave me once when
i was working up a case for chief mc-
caughrev on the lake shore did you
overhear their conversation 

           

  part of it they spoke in whispers
but i have an acute ear and besides they
were not far from the lunch counter which
was my coign of vantage at the time
repeat what you heard 

   batson said dell man i want
to play a joke on a certain individual in
this city this is no place to talk the
matter over so meet me at seven oclock
at my office at the merchants ex-
change  

   batson promised to be there and they
separated  

  but you did not lose sight of deli-
man 

  oh no from the saloon he went to
the russ house and in the reading-room
sat down at a-desk and wrote a letter

sealed stamped it and put it in the letter-
box at the corner

   its a pity you could not have read
the address

  i did read it

  chick youre comin on

  thank you the address was miss
hester astorel no - broadway oak-
land 

  good well know what it contains
before many hours

  from the letter-box dellman went to
his room in a bush street lodging-house
and is there yet for aught i know to the
contrary 

  the conversation above detailed had
taken place in a little up-stairs room in
the sailors lodging-house hired for the
occasion by the great detective

  when chick had concluded his state-
ment nick wrote two letters one to
chief crowley with an iuclosure the
other to albert dellman

  go to the city hall first said the de-
tective to his assistant and have chief
crowley o k the newspaper copy which
i have inclosed as for the other business
mentioned in my note he can attend to
that without your assistance

  what is the business

  the arrest of flat-nosed batson he
is wanted in denver for burglary

  but batsons appointment with dell-
man  flow will you discover what asto-
rels enemy wants of the man or wants
done by somerascal of batsons ilk
your questions chick evidence your
appreciation of the situation batsons
arrest will not interfere with the move-
ment dellman proposes making that is if
i know myself that is if i know myself
and about this hour in the afternoon i
think i do 

nick spoke with the calm confidence
that was a part of his nature

  the other letter which you hold in
your hands chick is addressed to albert
dellman and is signed james batson 
nick carter weekly	

  i see your game sir but--

  you are afraid dellman may detect

the forgery cli  

  yes

  no danger on that score my good fel-
low for i happen to know just what kind
of a fist our man  of tlie flat-nose writes
it is in back-hand style and is easily im-
itated

  i might have known that you would
not make a miscue 

  the letter states that the writer lias
been arrested that there is no hope of es-
caping conviction and recommends that
the business of playing a joke on some-
body which dellman desires transactedt
be intrusted to the writers pal nevada
saul

  precisely and nevada saul will be
kick carter 

  of course and batson per carter
further conveys the information that saul
may be found at this place at seven
oclock this evening now hurry off
chick and get that newspaper copy fixed
by the chief for i want it to appear in
the last edition of the bulletin this after-
noon youll have time i think

  chick was off like a shot

  an hour later flat-nosed batson occu-
pied a cell in the city prison

  the captain in charge received orders
to permit no visitors to see or talk with
the prisoner unless by order of nick or
one of the superior judges

  the six oclock edition of the bulletin
contained an additional number of perso-
nal items

  one read as follows

  col bentlv henderson of missouri
one of the inillionaire railroad builders of
that state arrived in town this afternoon
he is the uncle of mrs astorel whose
husband is now on the ocean bound for
honolulu he will remain in the state for
several weeks 

  nick carter read the item and smiled
in satisfaction

  that will catch him i think he
said to himself

  at seven oclock the detective dis-
guised as nevada saul received a visi-
tor at the little room in the sailors
boarding-house

  the visitor was albert dellman

chapter iii

a murderous scheme

  dellman bestowed a searching look on
the disguised detective as he entered the
room

  hes satisfied thought nick as the
villian shifted his gaze to the side win-
dow which overlooked a small dirt
alley

  placing a chair close to this window
dellman sat down and opened the con-
versation

  were you expecting me he asked
carelessly

  yes flat-nosed batson said youd
probably whirl in and gimme a job ef i
waited here for yer this evenin

  hm what do you know of batson 
i know hes a thurrerbred an that
lies in a hole  

were you ever a partner of his
was i a pardiier i should ree-mark
some o tlier neatest jobs  the coast
war did over thar in nevady when we
worked together

  batson probably told you that i
wanted his assistance in playing a joke 
a friend of mine didnt he

  yes

  did he say anything more

  not a word praps he might ha un-
loaded his mind if hed knowed anything
more bout tlier business

  dellman took out his cigar case selected
two cigars and offered one to nick

  soon the two men were puffing con-
tentedly away

  the joke if played at all must be
	nick carter weekly

played to-night said dellman after a
pause

  ill do whatever flat-nosed batson
would ha done slongs theres boodle
in prospect

   you shall be well paid for your ser-
vices you can spar i suppose

  spar now you shout i kin spar for
anything from a drink to a square
meal

  you misunderstand me perhaps re-
turned dellman quietly with his cold
gray eyes intently fixed upon the false
sauls face for i spoke in a fistic sense
for example and the speaker doubled
up his fists assumed a pugilistic attitude
and made several passes at an imaginary
opponent

  nick broke into a loud guffaw at this
exhibition

  spar thats too fancy a word for
me old boss slugs tlier caper see
and on the instant nick executed a num-
ber of movements with such swiftness
and dexterity as to cause dellman to nod
his head in delighted approval

  youll do i fancy he remarked
and now for action first i will show
you the man on whom the joke is to be
played

  dellman arose and opened the door
and nick passed out in a very curious
frame of mind

  the villain had fallen into the trap too
read i  y

  but the adventure had commenced and
the courageous detective was determined
to see it to the end

  up clay street they went past san-
some and into leidesdorff

  the latter is a short dark narrow little
street but little used at night by repu-
table people on account of the exceptional
facilities it offers for the commission of
robbery

  into leidesdorff street dellman turned
nick closely following

  under a lamp-postat the corner of sac-

ramento street the guide stopped and
looked at his watch

  five minutes to eight he said
hell be herein five minutes

  the disguised detective waited in some
impatience for the man to appear in or-
der that the next move in the peculiar
game that was being played might be
made

  at eight oclock a policeman slowly
sauntered up to the corner where the two
men were standing

  he looked sharply into their faces and
then passed on

  a thrill passed through nicks frame
as he met the searching gaze of the
guardian of the peace

  thats the man said dellman in a
whisper

  what nick whispered back is
their joke to be played on a copper
yes

  what is ther style o the joke 
this you must follow him to cali-
fornia street and when you see him go
down some stairs into a basement you
must be close  his heels so that when
he turns you can play the joke

  suppose he does not turn round but
waltzes into ther basement 

  all the better for it is not tenanted
is in fact a large empty store-room where
the tramps occasionally hang out 

all right now about ther joke
it is to be played with this joker
dellman drew a sand-club from his
breast and handed it to the false nevada
saul

  strike back of the ear and strike
hard heres five hundred dollars in ad-
vance five hundred more goes into your
hand when youve laid him out

  nick shoved the notes which dellman
held out into his pocket and then asked
wherell i run across you to corral
the other five hundred

  at the basement dooi ill be on the
nick carter weekly		

spot so soon as you have completed the
job 

  null sed and now to business for
the copper is half way to california street

 now  

  so savin nick liurried away and he
chuckled softly to himself as his feet
lightly brushed the cobblestones of the

 roadway

  tlie policeman was in the act of de-
scending the stairs to the unlighted base-
ment in a silent and unlighted part of
the street when nick prepared to pounce

upon him

  but the night guardian turned before
thesand-club could be raised and with a
few quickly spoken words allowed his
own club to come into play with the effect
of stretching the great detective at full
length at the toot of the stairs

   he lay like a log without motion

  the policeman was bending over him
when an eager voice the voice of albert
delhnau caused him to look up with a
start

  have you fixed him

   i reckon i have captain

  anyway he declines to breathe as
you may observe

   the villain rubbed his hands gleefully

  how well i played my little game
he chuckled hoodwinked and laid out
the greatest detective in the united
states ha ha sam but this night has
been a good one for both of us indeed

  how about the blunt queried the
policeman coldly

   yes yes you shall be paid first ill
 go through mr nick carters clothes and
 hand you the five hundred dollars he
 thought he had picked up in the softest
 snap he had ever struck and then ill add
 to it five hundred out of my own pocket

  nick had placed the notes in his vest-
pocket so the arcli-villain had no diffi-
culty in finding them

  a thousand dollars boston sam isnt

bad for one clip over the head with a
club eh

  no

  youve probably robbed drunks and
blackmailed chinamen at much less profit
per night 

  what ive done is none of your busi-
ness boston sam surlily returned

  no i suppose not i was only jok-
ing yon know this is my joking night
i wanted to plaj a joke on nick carter
alul ive done it but the joke is not en-
tirely played yet we must get tnis body
into the basement and examine it for
signs of life 

  the door was unlocked and the body
was carried in

  in the middle of the room was a pile of
empty dry-goods boxes

  behind these the body was deposited
dellman then returned to the door and
locked it with a key taken from his
pocket

  boston sam produced his bulls-eye
lantern and flashed the rays upon the de-
tectives face

  nicks eyes were closed his cheeks
were pale as death

  delhnau knelt down and placed his
ear over the detectives heart

  it beats faintly  he said hes just
alive and thats all 

  do you want him dead  asked the
murderous policeman

  dead as a herring did you not un-
derstand me when i made the bargain
with you didnt i tell you i wanted you
to knock him out for good and all
replied dellman angrily

  oh very well was the careless re-
sponse id as soon give him a second
crack as not want to see it done

  yes-no ill step to the other side
of the boxes while you paste him give
him enough this time for the fellow has
escaped death so often that its not policy
to take any chances with him now 

  the villain took himself from the sight
	nick carter weekly

of his cold-blooded tool and tlie detective
victim

  a number of heavy blows each fol-
lowed by a sickening thud satisfied the
listener that the murderous work was be-
ing done by an expert at the business

  now what do you think boston
sam hoarsely cried out

  dellman stepped from behind the
boxes and by tlie lanterns light beheld
a spectacle that made him shudder case-
hardened though he was

  the detectives face was covered with
blood blood streamed from his ears and
nostrils while his hair was matted with
gore

  there was every indication that his
skull had been broken and that his ca-
reer had been abruptly cut short

  what shall we do with it asked the
murderer pointing to the ghastly sight

  feed it to the rats theres a trap-
door opening into a still lower-room a
former receptacle for smuggled goods
theres nothing there now but rats hun-
dreds of them and all hungry and
vicious they wont leave a scrap of
flesh on his bones what do you think
of the scheme

  it couldnt be improved upon
but--

  but what

   ill need a drink before i go any fur-
ther

  im as weak as a cat now the air
down here is not suited to my constitu-
tion 

  ill go out and get you a drink

  dellman hurried away to return in five
minutes with a bottle of whisky

  there lie said drink that and
then rush the business through i want
to getaway from here for ive other busi-
ness to attend to that cant be post-
poned  

  boston sam took the bottle sat down
on a box and took liis time in putting
down the bracer

  when he returned the bottle to dell-
man over half the contents had been
poured out

  the lantern meanwhile had been rest-
ing on the floor with the light turned
from the spot where the detectives body
had lain

  well lets be going remarked the
policeman as he smacked his lips for
the jobs done

 what

  dellman snatched up the lantern and
brought the light to bear  the place of
murder

  nick carters body was  longer
there

  before the villain could open his mouth
to express his astonishment his murder-
ous tool coolly remarked 

    hes gone to the rats  

  dellman rushed to the trap-door lan-
tern in hand opened it and looked
down

  he saw a legion of ravenous rats squeal-
ing and fighting over some tempting mor-
sel that had but recently fallen into their
den

  and from the hole there arose the sick-
ening smell of raw warm flesh

  the villain closed the trap and rose to
his feet as pale as death

  how came you to do this he asked
gaspingly

  i heard footsteps outside and fearing
tnat some fool might stagger in and ob-
lige me to commit another murder i
rushed the stiff into the hole as quick as
you please  

  all right all right now for to-mor-
rows business you are to go to oakland
in the morning see the chief and get a
lay off for a couple of days if lie kicks
any resign from the force for theres
money enough in the work  hand to
keep you in idleness for the rest of your
life  

  im your tamate captain
nick carter weekly	

   you will rind me at the galeudo ho-
tel at nine oclock 

   ill be there on time

   when i meet you there i will tell you
what i want done  

   very well

   the two men parted at the california
street corner

  dellman took his way homeward in a
satisfied frame of mind

  when he had passed from sight bos-
ton sam walked slowly back to the
basement

   he reached it just as a man was com-
ing out of the door

  the man was nickcarter

   all serene chick

   yes said chick alias boston sam
weve fooled him beautifully

  youve fooled him you mean for
this nights work goes to your credit
chick not mine  

chapter iv

preparing the trap

  half an hour after the leidesdorff
street adventure the two detectives occu-
pied a private stall in a market street

restaurant

   while they refreshed themselves chick
told his story

   after i left you in the afternoon
he began i went as directed to the city
hall and was fortunate enough to find
chief crowley in his office

  i am al ways happy to oblige my
friend carter said he when he had read
the note and within ten minutes there-
after two commissions had been executed
-an officer had been dispatched to arrest
mat-nosed batson forthwith and a mes-
senger had been sent to the bulletin office
with the personal which the chief had
indorsed

   col crowley wanted me to dine with
him but i had to decline on account of

the important nature of the business that
engrossed my attention

  after batson had been brought in i
hurried to dellmans lodgings and here
again luck favored me he was in and i
gave the note into his hands but was off
before he could read it

   i waited across the street in a little
news-stand until became out and i shad-
owed him to the city hall

  in the belief that his steps would be
directed to the city prison i took a cut
off to the place by way of merchant
street and was behind the door in cap-
tain lindheimers office and concealed
from observation when he appeared and
asked to see the prisoner batson

  captain lindheimer who had been
hurriedly posted by me as to the situation
courteously complied with the arch-vil-
lain s request and conducted him to the
cell where batson was playing checkers
with his nose

  as soon as captajil lindheimer had
locked dellman in he gave me the oppor-
tunity i wanted of overhearing the conver-
sation between the two men by putting
me into the cell adjoining which is pro-
vided with excellent eavesdropping facili-
ties

  the first question asked by dellman
was  in refernce to the letter signed
jaires batson 

    did you write that he said

  flat-nose looked at it in amaze-
ment not by a jugful i didnt he
answered who in blazes has been for-
gin my hand-write

   i know the rooster said dellman
emphatically pies nick carter the
shrewdest and most dangerous detective
on the american continent

   the deuce you say  and you ought
to have seen batsons expression when he
spoke he was as white as a sheet and
he looked as scared as if he had seen a
ghost

   my god  he went on then im
	nick carter weekly

done for if nick carter is in san fran-
cisco my arrest lies at liis door and my
conviction will be certain but how do
you know that it is carter

   how do i know never mind how
i obtain my information but all tlie
same the man who put you in quod is
nick carter 

  batson dropped his eyes to the floor
and did not say anything for some time

  every now and then however he
would sigh deeply

  at last he looked up and regarded
dellman queerlv

   you wouldnt have come to see me
he said if you hadnt a point to make
what is it

   i want to help you at the same
time help myself

   help me can you do it

  he clasped his hands the big duffer
and looked entreatiugly at the cold cal-
culating villain before him

   i can help youi think let me ask
one question first if nick carter were
out of the way would you have any
chance of escaping conviction on the
charge for which you have been ar-
rested 

   every chance in the world the
case was put into nicks hands by the
denver chief of police the detective has
never reported what lie has found out
about the case i know that for i have a
pal in colorado who is in a position to
keep me well posted i know further that
nick lias got me dead to rights and that
he will pull the string that will let me
down into the mire when he gets me be-
fore the den ver court 

   good ill lay nick carter out before

midnight 

   you will but how

   never mind how leave that busi-
ness to me now for your assistance do
you know of anyone in san francisco
who can be trusted to perform the work
for which i engaged your services

   yes theres one man hes a jim-
dandy- the finest fakir on the coast he
has strength nerve and audacity and
can be depended on to work any kind of
a snap from cracking a crib to slitting a
weaznnd as long as theres money in it
 where can i find this paragon of
criminals 

    on the police force 

   what

   on the police force i tell von

   come now batson i want  jest-
ing this is a serious matter serious for
you and serious for me

  il im not jesting boston sam is 
the force but only for this week hes a
sub and got in through political influ-
ence 

   does chief crowley know his char-
acter and antecedents

   not he boston sam always hums
his bridges behind him there isnt a
man in the city who is on to him but
me 

   where shall i fhjd him 

  batson named the beat which included
leidesdorff street

  nothing more of importance was said
between them and soon dellman iook
his leave

  it was then five oclock

  captain lindheimerinformed me that
boston sam would report for duty at six

   do you know where he hangs out
i asked

   at the red retreat  stockton
street 

  fifteen minutes later i was in the re-
treat a corner saloon with a snide grocery
attachment and in conversation with
boston sam

  i gave him a note from captain lind-
lieimer informing him that his services
would not be required that night

  a-fter he had read it i told him i was
a sacramento constable and that i was
looking for a burglar who was supposed
to be in sausalito i gave a faked descrip-
nick carter weekly	

tion of my alleged quarry and offered
boston sam twenty dollars if lie would
go over to saueelito by the next boat and
make the am -l for me

   he jumped at the offer like a pike for
a young sucker and when i parted with
him at tlie cable ear which was to take
him to the water front it was half-past
five

  i hud then just thirty minutes in
which to do a change and get to the city
hall to prove that i have profiled by
your instructions i will say that at six
oclock precisev i was in captain lind-
heimers office and ready to go on duty
for the night as iloston sam

  chick youre a briek said nick
with enthusiasm

  dont mention it as i was on ny
way down merchant street toward mont-
gomery i nu t dellman he accosted me
as boston sam gave me a note from
flat-nosed batson and invited me into a
saloon to have a chat

  that sort of business wouldnt do at
all you know and so i informed him
he then suggested that we slip into a hall-
way on commercial street and do our
talking i consented to this and was
soon put into possession of the details of
the fiendish plot that had been concocted
against you i knew ou would recog-
nize me when i stopped at the sacra-
mento street corner and that you would
take a quick tumble to the little racket i
had entered upon 

  you acted with consummate ingenuity
and skill chick  said the great detec-
tive approvingly i couldnt have done
better myself 

  this was great praise but the faithful
assistant fully deserved it

  there was one thing as you know
that bothered me and that was how to
make dellman believe that you had really
been cast into the hole to constitute a din-
ner for the rats i had carried out the
other portions of my scheme of deception

well enough i had faked blood with red
paint an i had hit my boot in lieu of
your head with my club until my toes
and instep ache even now  but i might
have slipped up on the most important
part of tlie programme if i had not spied
a big black cat behind the boxes just as
dellman was going out to get me tlie
drink of whisky

  that cat had never done me any
harm but it had to be sacrificed all the
same and the smell of raw warm flesh
which greeted the villains nostrils had
something feline but nothing human in its
nature 

  chicks story was told

  and the telling not only demonstrated
the j-ouug detectives courage and astute-
ness but it also proved that albert dell-
man was a foe worthy of the great detec-
tives skill

  nick had never counted on the possi-
bility of the villain either penetrating his
disguise or discovering his presence in
san francisco

  that fellow must know me thats
certain mused the detective and yet
to save my life i cant place him who
can he really be i wonder

  chick said he after a period of se-
rious reflection you must play boston
sam fot me one more day you must
keep that oakland appointment

  further plans were discussed before
bedtime came

  nick in a new disguise that of a
smart appearing book canvasser was a
passenger  the first boat for oakland
which left the market street slip the
next morning

  dellman was to meet the bogus boston
sam at nine oclock and nick wanted to
transact a little business in the city of oaks
before giving his special attention to the
master villain

  it was not yet eight oclock when he
knocked at the door of a neat cottage on
	nick carter weekly

broadway a few blocks from the old
post-office corner

  the door was opened by a pert maid
in a white apron and with her sleeves
rolled up

  we dont want any books she said
brusquely and would have shut the door
in his face had not nick uttered the one
word 

   rondelle

  the girl turned pale glanced quickly
over her shoulder and then faltered out
an invitation to come in

  can i speak with you on the quiet
said nick in a low voice

  yes

   she led the way into the front parlor

  her hand trembled as she opened the
door for him to enter

   nicks face wore a smile of satisfaction

  he knew the girl having formed her
acquaintance some years before when she
was serving as maid for rondelle the
notorious confidence operator who after-
ward came to grief in sacramento

  to find her in service at the vane
house where mrs astorel and her
daughter were temporarily residing was a
suspicious circumstance and before pro-
ceeding with the business that had
brought him to the house the great de-
tective resolved to subject her to a little
judicious catechism

  now miss serena dare  he said
sternly when lie had seated himself in a
comfortable arm-chair it will be good
policy on your part to answer truthfullv
 
such questions as i may put to you touch -
ing your position in this house and the
motive that brought you to it

  who are you she hoarsely de-
manded after a vain attempt to discover
his identity

  did ybu ever hear of chief rogers of
sacramento

  yes 

   she shivered as she uttered the word

  now it does notin the least matter

who i am nick went on with grim
composure so long as i am in chief
rogers confidence and know that for
the last six months a warrant has been
out for the arrest of a certain pretty panel
thiefwho was known last -ear in new
york as pretty jane  but who was
christened serena dare when she was an
innocent babe some twenty-six years
ago 

  the girls face flushed at this correct
statement of her age

  she did not look more than sweet six-
teen

  i know you now she said as she
bit her lips in fear and wrath  you are
nick carter

  wrong

  then who are you if not he
iam chick the little giants assis-
tant 

  ive heard of you but where is your
superior 

  dont know maybe dead havent
seen him since yesterday afternoon
never mind him then whats your
lay- what do you want 

  the girl was recovering her self-pos-
session

  there is but one nick carter ran
her thoughts at this juncture he is in-
deed a terror but im not afraid of a doz-
en chicks or dicks or toms or harrys 
what do i want said nick in-
formation nothing more and nothing
less 

    about what 

  about you

  im nobody-just a plain servant-
girl  wages twelve dollars a month and
found 

  not wanting i hope

  sir

  miss dare gave the false chick a look
of lofty contempt

  see here serena this wont do wont
do at all see
nick cakier weekly	

 cant see for the dust in the room
 havent swept yet 

 that ought to be an easy job for
 you

 why

 you have such a sweeping manner

 nick gave utterance to a low chuckle

 then he glanced at his watch

 no time for chaffing he must get
 down at once to bed rock business

 the girl was turning her back on him
 when he said abruptly and with more
 sternness than lie had hitherto assumed 

 sit down and answer my questions
 your fate is in my hands if you refuse
 to obey me ill have you in jail for that
 sacramento job in less than half an
 hour 

 miss dare began to tremble again

 she sat down and faced him

 will you promise not to use your
 knowledge against me if t answer your
 questions to the best of my ability

 i will not only make that promise
 but i will give you the further assurance
 that yon shall never be prosecuted for the
 crime 

 ah with a sigh of intense relief
 then i am satisfied go ahead with
 your questions  

 nick had been quite east in his mind
 when he made the promise

 he neither run any risk in doing so
 nor did he put any onerous task upon his
 shoulders

 the man upon whom the panel game
 had been played had died the week before
 in spokane

 nick had learned the fact before he had
 left san francisco

 it was evident from miss dares lack
 of knowledge on the point that she was
 not a very close reader of the daily pa-
 pers

 i lie examination began in this wise

 how long have you been in service
 here 

 since yesterday

  who engaged you

  mrs vane

  through an advertisement

  no

  at an employment office

  no

  how then  

  i made a personal application for the
place

  how did you know there was a va-
cancy

  i did not know 

  then some one must have sent you
here

  some one did 

  what is some ones name

  a gentleman i used to know in sacra-
mento 

  dont close up like an oyster at the
most important point serena a gentle-
man from sacramento is very indefinite
i do not doubt but that there are several
gentlemen in sacramento and it may be
-its a bare possibility serena-that
your friend from the capital city may not
be a gentleman in the proper sense of the
term ill write to chief rodgers for a list
of all the gentlemen in his bailiwick if
his name appears thereon ill call at the
jail serena and let you pick it out 

  her eyes snapped savagely but she
made no answer

  out with the name serena or--

  his name is albert dellman

  i thought so 

  what do you know against him
nothing for he is one of the most re-
spected and popular residents of san
francisco 

  is he then he doesnt live in sacra-
mento now

  he never lived there i met him
while he was up on a visit

   of pleasure  

  pleasure and business

  strange that such a reputable gentle-
man should have become the friend of a
panel-but no serena ill not refer to
	nick carter weekly

 your past again now that youve turned
 over a new leaf all shall be forgotten
 the girl looked at him and shut her
 lips tightly

    she could murder me with pleasure at
 this moment thought nick

    the examination was resumed

    albert dellman sent you here for a
 purpose what was it

    to keep him informed as to the go-
 - ings on in the house-who came who
 went what was said and what was
 done 

   anything more

   no

    other instructions to come later i
 presume 

   presume what you like-i dont
 know 

   where were you to meet him and
 make your report

   at the galendo hotel room-

   when

    every evening at eight oclock until
 further orders

   very good now then serena you
 will not keep any of these appointments
 nor will you see mr dellman again not
 even if he calls in person at the house
 and asks for you

   miss dare bowed her head in acqui-
 esence of the arrangement

    a few more words in relation to her
 conduct while she remained under the
 vane roof and the detective curtly re-
 quested her to inform miss hester astorel
 that he desired to see her at once on
 business of pressing importance

    a few moments elapsed and the daugh-
 ter of the millionaire entered the parlor

    she was a demi-brunefcte with a low
 broad brow serious gray eyes a face of
 rare loveliness and a tall symmetrical
 figure and she carried herself with the
 grace and dignity of a duchess

    her face was grave when she entered
 the room but when serena dare had
 closed the door behind her and she found

herself alone with the disguised detec-
tive her eyes sparkled with pleasme and
she came forward and offering him her
hand spoke thus impulsively 

  oh mr carter how glad i am that
you have come i had every confidence
in you of course but i feared after what
papa said when he came home yesterday
that you might meet with some terrible
accident and leave us defenseless

   accidentswill happen nick replied
but then if i failed to keep my engage-
ment there was chick who could take
my place

  yes yes but i am glad that you
have come 

  are you certain that i am really
nick carter said the great detective
laughingly we have met before i am
in disguise and yet you implicitly con-
fide in me as the genuine and only nicho-
las c 

  i trust to my intuition it never
failed me yet she responded quietly

  and may it never fail you said
nick earnestly now to business for
my time is short did you receive a let-
ter last night or tins morning from al-
bert dellman

    yes 

   will you allow me to read it

   certainly

  while she was gone from the room to
get the letter nick glanced at his watch

   half-past eight

  an important move must be made be-
fore nine oclock

   he was prepared to make it

chapter v

danger in the air

   hester astorel was gone but a few mo-
ments

   nick took the letter which she placed
in his hands and read the following

  miss astorel-a rumor has reached
my ears that yourself and your mother
nick carter weekly	

look upon me os the enemy whose evil
machinations against your father induced
his hurried flight to honolulu a de-
cent regard for my honor my reputation

hitherto n  assailed demands that i
should at once offer such proof as must
convince you that the rumor is as base-
less as it is malicious and cowardly

  as an act of justice to myself will you
permit me to call upon you as soon as
possible an immediate answer is earn-
estly request d

      most respectfully yours

albert dellman

  a very cunning effusion said nick
when he had finished reading the letter
but luckily  one will be deceived by
it

  thanks to you mr carter

 he knows very well that his name
has not yet been publicly connected with
your fathers departure the detective
went on and he also knows or has
every reason to know that mr astorel
made  secret to his family of the knowl-
edge lie had gained relating to the villian
who had robbed him

  therefore miss astorel the point he
aims to make is to clear his skirts with
you what his object can be  leave for
you to judge 

 nick gave her a look whose meaning
she was quick to interpret

  i have never met the man but once
she said and he has never pretended to
be an admirer 

  perhaps he admires your fortune
perhaps he does but his admiration
shall not profit him any

  vet i would advise you to answer the
letter and grant his request 

  very well mr carter

  you might make the appointment for
to-morrow evening if convenient 

  yes that will suit

  if you should meet him anywhere to-
day do not speak to him

  i do not think there is any likelihood
f my meeting him to-day

  are you not going to the warner mil-
ler reception 

  yes

  with your mother

  yes

  then if you do not see albert dell-
man there he will have his eyes  you
beyond the shadow of a doubt and i will
not be surprised if your humble servant
comes in for a large share of the villains
attention 

  at the reception

  yes for i shall be there in the guise
of your respected uncle whose existence
by the way you never dreamed of until
you read the personal in the bulletin

  after promising to see her again nick
hurried off to a cheap lodging-house
down the street into which lie quickly
disappeared

  ten minutes later just as the clock in
the little office struck nine there emerged
from the establishment a stout well-
dressed gentleman with a snowy white
hair and beard and a noble bearing

  he walked with an erect figure and a
military tread using his heavy gold-
mounted cane not as an ornament but
as a necessary aid to locomotion

  the reception was to be held at the
court-house and in the forenoon for tlie
reason that the san francisco chamber
of commerce had arranged to honor the
gentleman from new york in the after-
noon

  mr miller had come to california as
the representative of the nicaragua canal
company and as the enterprise was one
in which the business men of the state
were vitally interested he had been
everywhere received in the most cordial
manner

  the oakland reception had been ar-
ranged under the auspices of the board of
trade and was not limited to gentlemen
because there were ladies in mr millers
party whose claims to the courteous con-
	nick carter weekly

sideration of the californians could nut
consistently be overlooked

  the ladies of oakland had appropriated
the judges chambers adjoinining the
large court-room as a coimnittee-room

  here a short time before the opening
of the proceedings sat hester astorel and
her mother the latter a handsome mid-
dle-aged lady with a plump figure and a
comely and intelligent countenance

  her manner was serious and expectant
and she kept her eyes fixed upon the
doorway

  the entrance of the old gentleman
with the gold-mounted cane caused her
features to brighten with pleasure and
satisfaction

  my dear niece spoke the new-com-
er as he came forward and took her two
hands in his and softly pressed them i
am pleased to meet you under these hap-
py circumstances i saw your husband in
the east and counted on meeting him
here to-day hut business is business and
he had to sail for the islands

  he went for his health  said mrs
astorel with a smile which the new-
comer returned he had met with some
reverses and his health had given away
under them 

  pardon me then for having alluded
to the present circumstances as happy
ones i am deeply grieved to find that

they are tinged with sadness but--

  what cant be cured must be en-
dured eh

   phe ladies started at the voice which
came from the doorway and looking up
saw a policeman of the flash order
standing there with a grin upon his face

  excuse me for interrupting you he
said still grinning but im used ter
sorrer and know it aint er bit er use
crin over spilt milk see

nick carter alias col bently hender-
son mrs astorels uncle now spoke up
look here my man he said pom-
pously you may not know with whom


you are taking liberties another insult-
ing word from your coarse lips and old
as i am i will arise and throw you into
the street and there dance upon your
anatomy until you cry for quarter

  who are you any how old skeez-
icks 

  there is my card sir 

  the policeman picked up the piece of
pasteboard which nick threw at him
glanced at it coolly and then as coolly
put it in his vest-pocket

  colonel i apologize i did not know
you were a missourian ta-ta 

  the policeman disppeared with a
broader grin than ever upon his counte-
nance

  outside he was greeted by albert dell-
man

     well  queried the arch-villain how
is it sam 

  its all right returped chick alias
boston sam for lies in there
who the colonel 

  yes

  good his appearance will cause me
to make a change in my programme but
a change for the better 

  what am i to do

  when the reception is over get him
into a corner alone

  ive got an excuse to do that i in-
sulted him and ive apologized but my
conscience troubles me and i want to
apologize again

  when youve got him alone tell him
that you are the everlasting friend of any
man who fought in a missouri regiment
that you are from hannibal yourself
and have often heard his name mentioned
in terms of praiseand admiration by the
people of that section of the state give
him a big fill about the chances of pick-
ing up fortunes in california

  but will he listen to all this balder-
dash  

  listen hell suck it all in like
mothers milk i know the stuff of which
nick carter weekly	

these pompous mil itary cusses are made
they like flattery and they think they
know it all whereas they are the easiest
people in the world to hoodwink

  all right ill do as you say

  after youve got him interested play
the gold-br ick racket on him hell take
in all you say as gospel truth  else im
mistaken in my man

  where shall i locate the brick

  in the hills a few miles from town
oil the martinez road tell him its not
far from joaqui  m illers mountain home
and that he can make a call  the poet
while he is tip there 

  well what next 

  tell him if he wants to-see the brick
he must go out with you this afternoon
or right after the reception that wont
take long for miller is in a hurry to get
to san francisco and you can probably
start bj one oclock

  what am i to do when i get him in
the hills

  nothing just get him out of town
and leave the rest to me

  the pseudo boston sam pretended to be
satisfied with the programme and at once
proceeded to carry out liis part of it

  of course lie had no difficulty in per-
suading the false col henderson to take
a ride with him after lunch

  nick was not a bit surprised when
chick related his conversation with a--
bert dellman

  just what i expected what i wanted
in fact he said i assumed the role
of the millionaire uncle in order to court
an abduction and abducted i am going
to be

  albert dellman is in urgent need of
fifty thousand dollars and as i have
spoiled his plan to make it out of marcus
astorel by sending the broker to hono-
lulu he will snap at the first chance that
offers itself to obtain the money by rob-
bing somebody else

   after you finish your business in the

hills chick you must drive back to town
and remain there keeping a close watch
over the vane residence until i arrive

  trust me for that 

  i do trust you chick by the way
what makes you fidget about so is it
pure nervousness from overwork lack of
sleep or what  

  i feel out of sorts why i dont know
perhaps there is too much electricity in
the air

  and the brave fellow tried to laugh off
his nervous feeling and partially suc-
ceeded

  their talk was interrupted by the en-
trance of a number of ladies who an-
nounced that the execrises were about to
begin

  nick did not remain to listen to the
speeches but after a few words with mrs
astorel and her daughter went to the
qaleiulo hotel and registered as col
henderson of missouri

  while the great detective was away
chick was talking business with dellman
in one of the small back rooms of a sev-
enth street hotel

  at one oclock in the afternoon the dis-
guised detectives playing the parts of vil-
lain and dupe respectively left oakland
in a spanking rig-a span of fast-stepping
nags and a handsome phaeton

  as they passed through the suburban
hamlet of temescal they both caught a
fleeting glimpse of the face cf a man who
was supposed to be at that moment either
in san cel i to or san francisco

  it was that of the genuine boston sam
and he had been sitting at an open win-
dow in the second story of a large build-
ing evidently a hotel or lodging-house
when the team approached

  he gave one glance at his counterpart
and then rose hurriedly and took himself
out of sight

  queer muttered nick very queer
indeed
r

	nick carter weekly

  i dont understand it at all re-
marked chick

  its certain that he did not intend
that we should see him

  yes for he dodged back out of sight
the moment he clapped his eyes on me
whats up do you think 

  -something that we had not counted
on chick dellman has made a discov-
ery of the cheat you have been practicing
on him 

  do you think nick that he found
out i was not boston sam before he sent
me  this errand

  no he was a hoodwinked man up to
the moment we left the morgue

  but boston sam must have seen him
else he would not be over here in temes-
cal close to the foothills and  the
route mapped out for me b dellman
undoubtedly

  the horses by this time had gone a few
blocks past the building

  chick we must checkmate this game
if we can  

  of course

  i will go on with the team while you
had best get out and interview mr bos-
ton samts a ticklish job ive laid out
for you my boy but ill trust you to car-
ry it through all right 

  ill do the best i can

  without further words nicks plucky
assistant got out of the phaeton and walked
hiuik to the hotel

  boston sain met him at the foot of the
stairs as he was about to ascend to the
second story

  the two men habited alike and re-
sembling each other so closely that an
intimate friend might have found it hard
work to tell which was the false and
which the true stared at each other for a
moment without speaking

  then the simon pure boston sam
opened his mouth ive been looking
for you  he said

 thats lucky returned chick
coldly

  its the biggest kind of luck come s
up stairs wont you 

  chick followed the reprobate police-
man to the room in which he had been
seen from the phaeton

  the brave fellow vaguely felt as he
took a seat that there was danger in the
air

chapter vi

 chicks desperate encounter

 once seated in the room chick
staxted the ball by saying 

 what do you want of me

  i want your advice 

  state your case

  first let me explain i went to sau-
celito and did not find your man of
course  

  why of course

  because the man lives in the moon i
  got back to san francisco by the late
  boat last night and learned from flat-
  nosed batson that i had been monkeyed
  with by a detective

  chick whistled

  here was news indeed

  where did you see batson he asked
  quickly

  at the red retreat

  how did he get out of jail 

  on an order from nick carter the
  man who caused his arrest 

  that was a queer proceeding wasnt
  it

 no for chief crowley was holding
 batson subject to nick carters instruc-
 tions crowley would do anything to
 obligt the new york detective 

  yes i presume he would and where
  is carter now 

  i have no idea you ought to know
  it seems to me 

 why ought i to know
nick carter weekly	

 because youre his partner thats
 why

 am i and how did you arrive at that
 extraordinary conclusion

 by talking with flat-nosed batson
 and afterward with albert dellman we
 put two and two together and tumbled
 to the truth in no time this morning
 i came over to temescal at dellmans
 order  

 why didnt you go up into the hills
 with your companions in crime and have
 the settlement with the colonel and my-
 self occur at one and the same moment

 boston sum grinned

 id as soon tell you as not he said
 the boss thought the business might be
 managed better if the forces of both op-
 posing parties were divided

by which you mean that he expects
to make as quick work of the colonel as
you will make of me

 precisely

 the cool audacity of the fuffian rat-
 tled chick somewhat

 well then he said sternly as he
 rose to his feet and put his hand on his
 trusty revolver suppose you start in
 now with y our little circus you have
 been hired to lay me out proceed with
 the laying  

boston sam stood up with a strange
smile on his face

 he made  attempt to draw a revol-
 ver

 nor was his attitude an aggressive one

 ihor one moment he looked at chick
 whose pistol was out and cocked and
 then suddenly threw up his hands

on the instant something happened
that nick carters brave assistant had not

 calculated on

 when he had entered the room he had
 unthinkingly taken the seat boston sam

 had indicated

 it was directly under a sliding trap-
 door in the ceiling put in probably for
 purposes of ventilation

  when he arose to his feet the door slid
back noiselessly and the face of a man
appeared at the aperture

  the face belonged to flat-nosed bat-
son

  one of his hands clasped the handle of
a tailors goose weighing a dozen pounds
or more

  his eyes meanwhile were fixed intent-
ly upon the person of boston sam

  when the latter raised his bauds in air
flat-nosed batson acted

  down went the heavy iron in the direc-
tion of the unsuspecting chicks head

  only a miracle it seemed could in-
tervene to save his life

  chick could never explaiu why he
moved his position at that supremely crit-
ical moment

  but he did move forward a step invol-
untarily and the goose instead of crush-
ing his skull just grazed his right elbow

  striking the young detectives funny
bone it gave him such a queer sensa-
tion as of partial paralysis that he re-
laxed his grasp  his revolver and it fell
to the floor

  he stooped quickly to pick it up but
before lie could reach it boston sam was
upon him

  a terrific struggle ensued

  boston sam as he rushed forward es-
sayed to throw his arms around the detec-
tives neck

  without raising his head chick antici-
pated the movement

  before the ex-sluggers hands touched
liis would-be victims shoulders chick
had him about the waist

  the next instant the assistant of the
great nick carter gave a superb exhibi-
tion of his muscular strength

  the burly body of boston sam rose
quickly in the air and as quickly shot
backward and descended with crushing
force against the plastered partition

  panting from the terrific effort he had
put forth chick stood still for one -
	nick carter weekly

liient and looked at the form of his par-
tially stunned adversary

  suddenly boston sams heavy should-
ers began to move

   chick gave a step forward with revol-
ver clubbed when a noise at the door at-
tracted his attention

   he turned liis head and-on the instant
flat-nosed batson entered the room

   with one bound and regardless of the
weapon that confronted him he was at
chicks side

  dodging the blow aimed at his head
he raised his right hand which had been
elosed since his entrance and threw some
powdery substance in the gallant young
detectives face

   it was red pepper and partially filling
chicks eyes nearly blinded him at the
same time causing him the most excruci-
ating pain

  rut he did not meekly fold his hands
and give up the ship though his situa-
tion was a most desperate one

   with a yell like that of a wild beast he
sprang upon batson beat him to the
floor stamped on him then turned as he
saw boston sam coming- and assailed
that fighting expert with the ferocity of
a demon

   chicks blood was up

  he could scarcely see and he was
suffering agonies from his injured eyes
and yet he felt possessed of the strength
of a dozen men

  boston sam had his knife out-a huge
chinese cleaver-but chick cated no
more for the weapon than if it had been
a toothpick

  his onslaught was so furious that the
villain could do no more than give chick
a slight prick in the arm

  the smarting sensation caused by the
puncture of the flesh gave zest to the de-
tectives ferocity

  he pummeled boston sam until the ex-
slugger sank unconscious to the floor with

features indistinguishable by reason of
blood and bruised flesh

  flat-nosed batson had not moved since
chick had laid him out

  there groaned the brave fellow as
he groped his way to the door i think
theyre fixed for a few moments long
enough for me to get down stairs to the
wash-room 

  he reached the door opened it and
passed into the corridor

  he felt about the lock after he had
closed the door found the key turned it
and then taking the key out put it in liis
pocket

  at the top of the stairs he hesitated a
moment for it seemed to be darker than
usual in that locality

  had his eyesight grown dimmer or had
the hall been darkened since his entrance
into the house

  but he had no time for speculation

  he must do something at once to re-
lieve his eyes

  with his hand on the balustrade lie
prepared to descend the stairs

  he took one step and nothing hap-
pened

  two steps and--

  his feet encountered space

  a cry of terror involuntarily burst from
his lips as he went down to strike with
a cruel crash among a heap of broken
boxes old bottles and dishes and to feel
his senses leaving him

  as he lay there under the stairway
without sense or motion boston sam
came noiselessly out of the room above
and stopping at the head of the stairs
listened intently for a moment

  satisfied that the detective had fallen
into the trap set for his benefit in the
event of his escaping from the clutches
of his foes in the room the ex-slugger
went back for his comrade in crime

  but flat-nosed batson was too sick to
move

  he was a very sick man indeed
nick carter weekly	

 after trying in vain to arouse him bos-
 ton sam made up his mind to descend to

 his victim alone

 he found chick still insensible and
 dragged his body from under the stair-
 way to a small room in the basement

 after securing his ankles and wrists
 with stout cords he locked him in and
 departed

 the room had  window and was a
 veritable dark hole

 an hour passed away before chick
 came to his senses

 his eyes no longer pained him but
 because he could not penetrate the black
 darkness of the apartment he thought he
 had gone bli nd

 but he gave no serious thought to his
 own situation

 one subject alone engrossed his mind
 and as a dire possibility presented itself
 the cold perspiration started to his fore-
 head

 if nick should fail if he should be
 opposed by the whole force of the enemy
 and overcome or killed a terrible thing
 might happen to miss astorel for it is
 not her money alone that the villain dell-
 nian seeks  

 gloomy indeed were the brave voting
 detectives thoughts as the hours went
 by in that dark and stifling house and no
 relief came

chapter vii

ikvironed by perils

 luck had favored albert dellman in
 his villainous crusade

 after he had parted with the false bos-
 ton sam on the night of the leidesdorff
 stieet adventure he had gone to his room
 ail put cm his thinking cap

 matters during the evening had pro-
 ceeded so smoothly that he began to sns-
 pcct that there might be a screw loose

 somewhere

 heretofore his operations had been con-

 ducted with such skill and shrewdness
 that the possibility of detection and con-
 sequent punishment had been thoroughly
 guarded against

  in fact so well had he carried on his
game of robbery that he had had the un-
blushing effrontery to tell marcus astorei
to his face on the street that he dellman
was the man who had planned all the
abductions and had profited by them

  the cowardly miser said the vil-
lain to himself as his mind reverted to his
bad performances of tlie past was afraid
to put his case in the hands of the local
detectives for fear that i might tumble
to the game and come down on him for
it worse than ever so he had to go to
new york and dig up this man carter
a smart detective none smarter in the
united states but ive been a match for
him all the same he chuckled and
whats more old astorel cant put up any
trick to catch me that i wont be able to
get away with 

  then as he thought of what had slipped
from his grasp by the sudden departure of
the broker his hands clinched in murder-
ous anger and he cursed the day that saw
nick carter enter into the fight against
him

  after a weight consideration of the
situation he determined to have another
interview with flat-nosed batson before
he went to bed

  perhaps that worthy might either ease
his mind or prove that he had really
been duped

  when he reached the city prison a pa-
trolman who was temporarily in charge
of the office had just left his post to at-
tend to the agonizing call of one of the
female prisoners

  dellman stood by the railing so that he
could look upon the desk

  an open note probably but recently
taken from the envelope which lay be-
side it gave him a serious start for he
read the name at the bottom of it
nick carter weekly

  the name was nick carter

   watching his chance while the officers
back was turned he snatched up the note
and hastily read it

   it was short and to the point

  on no account must you permit any
one from the outside no matter if lie
were the governor himself to see or talk
with batson until i call or send a written
order 

  dellman after reading the note
glanced quickly down the passage and
to his unbounded relief saw that the offi-
cer was in the act of entering the cell
where the woman who had called to him
was confined

  realizing that moments were golden
he whipped out his pocketbook found a
blank leaf and with a pencil quickly cop-
ied the great detectives signature

  an expert at forgery he made every
stroke of his pencil tell

  his work done he put the book in his
pocket replaced the note  the desk
and walked noiselessly out

  as he was passing by the quarters set
apart for the newspaper reporters a
thought struck him and he glanced in

   no one was there

  dellman without -a moments pause
walked into the room which was lighted
up and sat down at a table provided
wth writing materials

  he took out the pocketbook tore out
the leaf with the imitation of nick car-
ters signature and placed it before him
on the table

   then he found a half sheet of foolscap
and soon produced the following letter

   it is necessary for the success of an
important movement against an eastern
crook lately arrived litre that james
batson should be released temporarily
from confinement i am unable to come
to the prison in person mr dellman
my friend and with whom you are ac-
quainted is empowered to take charge of

batson upon his release let flat-nose
out  receipt of this and oblige

                your friend

                     nick carter

   this he handed to the officer in charge
of the prison

   having read the false order the officer
as a careful man compared the signature
with that of the note he had received ear-
lier in the evening

  they were apparently identical

   all right mr dellman he said and
five minutes later flat-nosed batson and
his employer were outside and  their
way to an underground oyster saloon

   up to this time though suspicious that
some of his plans had either miscarried
or were in danger of miscarrying dcll-
maus mind had not dwelt on the possi-
bility that nick carter might be alive

  it was reserved for boston sam who
joined the party soon after they came into
the eating house to open the arch-vil-
lains eyes to the truth and to show him
the awful precipice upon which he was
standing

  nick carter alive meant his downfall
for the forgery would be detected before
another day ended

  if luck would but favor him in just
one instance he might win his wicked
battle after all

  if nick carter would only go to oak-
land in the morning without calling at
the city prison and discovering the decep-
tion that had secured the release of bat-
son all would be well

  it was extremely probable that the
great detective would take an early boat
for oakland in order to attend to his busi-
ness with the astorels and it was not
likely that he would call at the city pii-
son before starting

   so dellman reasoned and as the sequel
has shown he reasoned well

  but to make sure he was up before
daybreak next morning and while bos-
nick carter weekly	

ton sam watched the city prison en-
trance lie piped off the ferryboats

 arrangements for the clays programme
 had been made with his two hirelings

 the night before

 he was therefore prepared to leave the
 city when lie saw nick carter in the
 guise of a hook canvasser step up to the
 ferryboat office and purchase his ticket

 dellmans power of penetration was
 phenomenal

 it was well night impossible to deceive
 him when his senses were alert and he
 was on a keen lookout for points  -

 he knew nick carter the moment he
 saw liis face and noted the peculiar poise
 of his finely shaped head and thus know-
 ing lie set out to shadow him

 nick as the reader knows on arriving
 in oakland went immediately to the vane
 residence on broadway

 dellman in disguise saw him enter
 the house and rightly inferred that miss
 serena dare would be subjected to a
 searching oral examination

 when nick came out he was shadowed
 to the lodging-house where he became
 metamorphosed into col bently hender-
 son of missouri

 the arch-villain saw his quarry enter
 the court-house and then grinned like a
 fiend

 he would have the shrewd detective

 where lie wanted him before he left oak-
 land

 it was with malevolent joy that dell-
 man played chick against nick and saw
 them enter a livery stable for the purpose
 of hiring a rig for the martinez hills

 before they started however the arch-
 villai  had gone on horseback to the hills

 ln advance

 he stopped a few minutes at temescal
 where he had staked boston sam and bat-
 son gave them some further instructions
 ard then rode on

 he was up on the first rise in the range

when nick carter driving alone began the
ascent

  the great detective had changed his
plan of procedure after parting with
chick

  in view of the momentous interests at
stake it would be the height of rashness
to risk an abduction while his faithful
ally was absent and engaged upon an un-
dertaking that might have a disastrous
result

  therefore instead of permitting him-
self to be abducted according to the orig-
inal programme he intended to close in
on dellman and bring him back to oak-
land a prisoner

  the attempt at murder in the leides-
dorf street basement could easily be prov-
en against the villain and once in san
quentin with a heavy sentence over him
his persecution of the astorel family
would cease

  nick felt sure that he would meet dell-
man in the hills from the fact that bos-
ton sam had been left behind at temes-
cal

  in anticipation of an ambush the detec-
tive kept a wary lookout

  he had nearly readied the summit
when he saw a man sitting on a small
culvert where the road made a bend

  it was albert dellman

  nick drove up slowly fearing  im-
mediate trouble because he still enter-
tained the opinion that the villain knew
him only in his assumed character of the
missouri colonel -

  but when he came close enough to
catch dellmans eye he knew by its pecu-
liar glitter that his identity was known

  and with this knowledge came the
startling suggestion that his death and
not his abduction was desired

  but he must keep up his role of colonel
for the present and not let the villain
suspect lie was aware that his identity
had been discovered
nick caiiter weekly

  the horses were reined tip at a sign
from dellman

  why he exclaimed in assumed as-
tonishment as he looked into the phae-
ton i expected my partner why didnt
he come  

  he had business in teineseal which
detained him but he will come out in an
hour or so  

  nick spoke in a matter-of-fact way
though he could hardly keep a straight
face

  a farce was being played by two excel-
lent comedians

  but it might presently develop into a
tragedy

  the brick col henderson said
dellman respectfully is in yonder
cabin

  he pointed to a small wooden shanty
a few rods from the road at the openiing
of a small ravine

  bring it here ill wait for you
  but its buried

  cant you dig it up

  yes but it is very heavy and if i
brought it out here some one might come
along the road and notice it 

  what of it its yours isnt it
certainly it is mine but i bought it
from a man who had stolen it from a
m iner  

  ah 

but if you buy it-say at half price-
you can have it cut up and dispose of it
in sections without running any risks
i want to see the brick first it may
be bogus for aught i know 

  it is my desire that you should see it
hitch your team to a tree and come to
the cabin with me it is unoccupied
i am a stranger and you may not be
an honest man said nick bluntly
how do i knew that you do not intend
to rob me if you can

  i will prove to you that i am acting
squarely  dellman asserted with feigned
earnestness and sincerty here now ill

lay my revolver and knife down here on
this rock indicating a flat bowlder by
the roadside you do the same with
your weapons and well enter the cabin
unarmed  

  thats agreeable said nick who
felt able physically to handle a quartette
of dellinans

  the arcli-villain when the team had
been secured walked toward the cabin
nick following

  there was one small window on the
side

  it was placed high up and standing
 tipfoe dellman peered into the small
room and then motioned to the disguised
detective to do the same

 nick with one eye on the man of
crime used the other to take in the de-
tails of the apartment

  it was unfurnished save for a loug shal-
low box in one corner

  the brick is buried under that box
said dellman come lets go in

  nick not without some misgivings fol-
lowed the villain into the room

  but the moment the detective had taken
a step across the threshold dellman gave
him a quick powerful shove forward and
the next instaut sprang out of the door
and closed it

  but the door was made of common red-
wood boards and the detective felt 
alarm for he knew he could kick it down
before his enemy could return to the spot
with the revolvers

  he had made a step toward the door
with the purpose of demolishing it when
a peculiar hissing sound which was
quickly succeeded by a dry suggestive
rattle rattle rattle made him start vio-
lently and then nervously turn to face the
terrible danger that now unexpectedly
menaced him

  what he saw drove the blood from his
face

  he was a brave man but the sight he
beheld was one calculated to appall the
stoutest heart

  from out the box in the corner there
had crawled five large rattlesnakes

  of the most active and venomous kind
-the deadly diamond back-they were
moving swiftly toward the man who had
been caged in the shanty in order that
nick cabteli weekly

lie might fall a victim to their poisonous

fangs

  it would be courting death to try to es-
cape by the door for before he could hope
to smash it in the reptiles would he upon
him as for the window there was no
way of reaching it in time to break
through and escape

 and yet lie must do something he
must not stand still and accept the fear-
ful fate which that villain of villains
dellman had meted out to him

 one moment more-all the thoughts
that had  issed through his brain had not
occupied more than a few seconds-and
the rattlers would be upon him

 one-the largest-had coiled close to
his feet and nicks fear-dilated eyes
seemed to pierce the veil which shrouded
the future and to see himself a swollen
putrid cropse and-when suddenly the
thought came to him like inspiration
that all was not yet lost

  he had been a traveler in india where
the deadly cobra luxuriates and he had
been the companion and confidant of some
of the noted fakirs and snake charmers of
the hindoo land

 he could now make practical use of
the curious knowledge he had gained from
them

 a low sibilant whistle made with
closed teeth arrested the motion of every
rattler in the room

 flic one nearest who was about to
strike drew back its head slowly uncoiled
itself and slunk quietly to the cover of
the box

 the others followed until not a snake
could be seen

still the low hissing sound was kept up
until the detective had reached the door

 he had his foot raised to break it
down when the thought of dellman
made him patise

 the villain must suppose that his fiend-
ish scheme had succeeded

 therefore he lowered his foot and lis-
tened with all his ears for any sounds of
the enemys return

soon a crackling of dry twigs outside

announced that some one was approach-
ing

 nick began to groan faintly as the
steps came nearer the door

i he key turned the door was thrown

open and then the detective made a rush
and caught the oncomer by the throat

  one swift glance told him that the man
was not dellman

  he was tall angular hook-nosed and
was dressed like a hunter

  but he had muscles like steel and was
as active as a cat as the great detective
soon discovered

 the moment nicks fingers clutched
his throat the man threw his long arms
around his assailants body and gave him
a hug like that of a grizzly bear

 though expecting every moment that
hisribs would crack under the terrible
pressure to which tley were being sub-
jected nick  gripped his opponent
about the windpipe with desperate force

  his own breath was leaving him and
it did not seem possible for him to come
out victorious in the struggle

 but at the moment when his fingers
were ready to relax nicks unknown ad-
versary dropped his hands

  this action was followed by a tighter
more fearful pressure of the throat for
with the stoppage of the hook-nosed mans
efforts nicks lungs expanded and new
strength was infused into his muscles

  not even a second samson could long
withstand the choking that the detec-
tives foe was receiving

  his face became mottled his eyes pro-
truded until it seemed as if they would
burst from their sockets and his tongue
lolled out like that of a dog heated from
fierce exertion

  at last his knees began to give wav
and he became as limp as a rag

  at this stage of the proceedings nick
suddenly withdrew his fingers from about
the mans throat and giving him a pow-
erful shove made him measure his length
on the ground

  as he lay there and while the detec-
tive was searching his person for weap-
ons there came that sharp suggestive rat-
tle which nick had heard with a shud-
der of dread but a short time before

  as he sprang to his feet the rattler
struck

  but the fangs werenever meant to work
harm to the great detective

  they had sought a nearer better defined
mark the neck of the prostrate uncon-
scious man

                     


nick carter weekly

  too late to arrest the dread catastro-
phe nick could only seize the reptile by
the tail and beat its bead into a jelly
against the corner of the cabin

  a look about him when he had fin-
ished this savagely pleasurable operation
showed him that the other rattlers-four
in number-had taken advantage of the
open door to escape from the cabin and
that they were now making off rapidly
for cover among the rocks and brush a
few rods away

  a glance at the rattlesnakes victim
showed that human aid would be useless

  struck in one of the most vulnerable
portions of the body full in the jugular
vein already the dark shadow of death
had overspread the mans face

  with a grave countenance nick
dragged the body into the cabin and
closed and locked the door

  he was deeply shocked and grieved at
the occurrence

  but his grief would have been tem-
pered somewhat had lie known then
what he afterward discovered that the
dead man was an ex-convict a notorious
law-breaker had been concerned in more
than one murder and that as albert dell-
mans tool he had assisted in the abduc-
tion of the various members of the asto-
tel family

  in anticipation of the return of the
arch-villain nick concealed himself in a
clump of chemisal near the cabin and
waited

  he was no longer unarmed for upon
the person of the rattlesnakes victim he
had found two revolvers and a large liunt-
ing-knife

  ten minutes elapsed and dellman ap-
peared in sight in his right handwas a
cocked revolver

  when within about ten paces of the
cabin door he stopped and listened for
some sound from within

  a faint moaning noise greeted his ears
as he bent his head forward

  satisfied that his foul scheme had suc-
ceeded dellman walked rapidly up to
the door

  he was about to turn the key when
prudence suggested that lie first take a
look in at the window

  as he stood on tiptoe peering in
through one of the panes hjs back was

toward nick who was not more than
ten feet away

  now was the great detectives oppor-
tunity

  with the quickness of a panther he
leaped forward and struck deliman a
powerful blow behind the ear

  the villain went down with such force
that his bead struck the ground with a
resounding thud while his pistol went
flying out of his hand and exploded in
the brush

  before he recovered his senses xick
was astride of his body and busily em-
ployed in securing his wrists and ankles
with cords which he had provided him-
self with before starting on his journey

  there he said to himself as he pre-
pared to rise to his feet liis work finished
that job is settled and it is a good job
too  

  a rustling sound behind him made him
turn with a start but too late to save
himself

  he had time only to see the evil face
of boston sam and then a heavy club
descended  his head and consciousness
left him

chapter viii

nick comes out ahead

  it was close upon sundown when nick
carter opened his eyes and realized his
cond ition

  he was lying in the cabin bound hand
and foot and within a few feet of the
body of the man who had died from the
bite of the rattlesnake

  his enemies had departed-perhaps
gone to oakland or-he shivered and
grew pale at the thought-they had gone
down the canyon to find more snakes to re-
place the ones which had escaped

  he did not try to account for the pre-
sence of the poisonous reptiles in the
cabin when he had first entered it for
his thoughts were directed into sterner
grooves

  the dead man could have furnished the
explanation for the snakes had been his
property and had been captured for ship-
ment to the smithsonian institute

  nicks head ached from the terrible
blow he had received and when his
mind reverted to his unaccomplished
work the pain was intensified
nick carter weekly

 it became mental as well as physical

 the prev--nee of boston sam in the
 hills-vh  i ji id have been safe in the
 care of chirk hud matters gone right-
 meant that s me accident had happened
 to his faithful assistant

 perhaps chirk had been taken by sur-
 prise as he nick had been and was
 even now a prisoner or worse still dead
 in temescal 

 the thought of such a dire misfortune
 was an agonizing one to the great detec-
 tive for he believed if neither he nor
 chick appeared in oakland the next day
 that some vile plot against miss astorel
 woulfl be successfully carried out

 the great detective shut his eyes and
 groaned

 at the same moment in teniescal

 chick a prisoner also was following his

 chiefs example

 could it be possible thought nick
 that the cause of the wicked would be
 allowed to triumph

 had his luck at last deserted him 

 he would not believe it and he tugged
 and strained at his bonds until the blood
 streamed from the torn flesh but to no
 purpose

 the cords had been put on to stay

 he rolled over and over on the floor in
 the nervousness of acute despair

 suddenly lie found himself in front of
 the box which had been the nest of the
 rattlesnakes and gazing at it as if fasci-
 nated

 soon he began to tremble not from
 fear but from the suggestion of a blissful

  possibility

 the box had a sheet-iron band and
 this band had been broken neat tlie bot-
 tom at one corner leaving it jagged and
 sticking out

 nick propelled himself by means of his
 knees and elbows until he reached the
 box



   he was moving toward the door
 when he heard the key softly turn in the
 lock

   the enemy had returned

   nick was unarmed but he minded not
 this disadvantage

    in his present state of mind he felt able
 to cope with an army

   but though the door was unlocked no
 one entered

   nick wondered greatly at this circum-
 stance

    and all was so silent without

   what could it mean

    while he stood still debating what he
 should do a womans shriek burst upon
 his ears

    it was succeeded by a mans brutal im-
 precation

   as nick threw the door open and
 rushed out the shriek was repeated

   it came from the lips of a lovely
 woman not ten yards away

   it was hester astorel and she was
 struggling in the arms of boston sam

   nick was at the scene in two bounds
 and it was not one blow that he gave the
 ex-slugger but two three four-upon
 head face and neck

   the assault resulted in a complete
 knockout

   boston sam sought mother earth with
 a sprawd that was far from elegant while
 hester sobbed her thanks on the great de-
 tectives manly shoulder

 another instant and with the jagged

chapter jx-

victory for the right

 boston sam was handcuffed and lashed
 to a tree pending arrangements for his
 removal to the oakland jail

 he was thoroughly cowed and now
 knew that the game was up as far as he
 was concerned

 he told nick that he had left chick at
 teniescal in charge of flat-nosed batson

sheet-iron band he was sawing away at the who though not strong enough to travel

 cords about his wrists

 five minutes sufficed to do the work
 and place him on his feet a free man once
 more

 free no not entirely free if action
 were to be considered

 he would not be free until he had
 passed the door and reached the open air

 had yet enough physical ability and men-
 tal gumption left in him to guard a bound
 prisoner

 dellman he said had started for oak-
 land immediately after nick had been
 overcome and placed in the cabin

 how did he go with the team or
 on horseback as he came


nick carter we kly

  on horseback

  and the livery rig-where is it

  back in the road where you hitched
it 

  good said nick anc with restored
confidence he fairly beamed on the pale-
faced young lady at his side

  i saw mr dellman in oakland before
i came out she said and i also over-
heard a conversation he had with serena
dare mrs vanes maid-of-all-work 

  the detective showed the greatest in-
terest at this statement

  he came to mrs vanes thinking i
was out  she went on i did go out to
make some purchases but after traver-
sing a few blocks found that i had forgot-
ten my purse

  as i was returning to get it i saw mr
dellman enter the front gate

  suspecting that no good was meant
by this call i waited until the maid had
admitted him and then secretly entered
the house by the back way

  serena showed him into the parlor
and as my mother and my aunt had gone
out to a neighbors the two thinking
they were alone in the house spoke in
ordinary tones so that i could easily hear
everything that was said from my station
in the hall

  the maid told him of your visit early
in the morning and of other matters
which it is not necessary now to speak of
and in return he informed her of what
occurred in the hills and at temescal

  when the villain announced that
your fate was sealed and that the man-
ner of death had been left with boston
sam i waited to hear  more but hur-
riedly left the house procured a saddle
horse at a livery stable and galloped
swiftly to your assistance

  why didnt you bring an officer with
you   asked nick as he gazed at her with
respectful admation

  i went to the police office but all the
officers were out i did not even tell the
captain what was wanted i was so greatly
excited minutes were precious to my
mind for at any moment this boston
sam might take a notion to carry out his
fiendish employers order

  it was well that you acted so promnt-
ly  nick feelingly said for boston

sam was at the door of the cabin when
you came in sight of it

  i know and when i saw him i ran
forward with all my might

  were you armed

   had this said hester with a slight
blush

  she held out a pair of scissors

  nick could not repress a smile

  i could find nothing else except a
carving knife and that was too large and
clumsy 

  you needed no weapon spoke the
detective earnestly for your presence
alone was sufficient to save my life i
shall never forget your courageous and
self-sacrificing action

  again the young lady blushed but this
time from pleasure not shame

  tliev reached temescal with boston
sam just after dark

  nick did not anticipate any trouble
with flat-nosed batson

  he expected to find the fellow half
drunk and so stiff and sore besides from
his bruises that he would not be likely
to make much of a resistance

  and so it proved

  batson was found squatted in the front
of tlie room in the basement that held
chick a prisoner with a bottle of whisky
in his lap and his head nodding drowsily

  nick gave him a cuff that sent him
sprawling on his back

  it did not take long to reduce him to
utter subjection

  entering the room quickly the great
detective found chick suffering more from
sore eyes than from the inconvenience of
his bonds

  an hour later chick was in oakland
receiving medical treatment

  he was well enough to accompany
nick on a certain expedition at mid-
night

  it was determined that the arrest of
albert dellman should take place at once

  he had made an appointment to call at
mrs vanes  the evening of the next
day but it would not be policy to wait
until then before closing in on him

  boston sam and flat-nosed batson
were already in jail and the former had
made a full confession which had been
legally taken down and attested before a
notary public
nick carter weekly	

  acting upon information furnished by
the ex-slugger nick and chick went to
a saloon on one of the main streets where
gambling was surreptitiously carried on
in a back room every night

  given the open sesame by boston
sam the two detectives had no difficulty
in obtaining an entrance

  the back room door was wide open
and the players at the long oval table-
the game was faro-were in full view from
the bar-room

  albert dellman sat facing the door
but his eyes were glued upon a stack of
chips staked upon a card in front of him

  nick and chick got out of liis line of
vision and calling the bar-keeper aside
had a few earnest words with him

  he was not a bad sort of fellow and
kept what was known as a respectable
joint

  no thugs hoodlums or tin-horn play-
ers were allowed to participate in the
games

  when dell mans real character was
made known to him he promised bis
hearty co-operation in the detectives
scheme to place him under arrest

  as he sauntered into the card-room
nick and chick placed themselves just
out of sight on opposite sides of the
doorway

  the barkeeper -waited until the deal in
hand had been consummated and the bets
settled and then he spoke thus to dell-
man 

  a gentleman of the name of batson
wants to see you outside

  the arch-villain started and turned
pale

  if batson wanted him then something
must have gone wrong

  perhaps chick had escaped from temes-
cal and was even now in oakland on his
trail

  the bare possibility of a miscarriage of
his evil plans gave him the cold shivers

  he rose quickly from the table took
something from his vest-pocket and held
it tightly in his hand as he walked to-
ward the door

  utterly unconscious of the nearness of
the danger he stepped confidently across
the threshold when--

  i want you came with stern impres-

siveness from the lips of nick carter
who at the same moment seized his quar-
ry by an arm

  chick on the other side grasped the
other arm

   it was all done in an instant

  albert dellman in the grasp of two
powerful and determined men knew it
would be a waste of time and energy to
struggle

  he submitted to the handcuffing pro-
cess without making a single movement
in resistance

  but when his white wrists had been or-
namented with nicks steel bracelets he
opened his mouth to speak

  youve got your points down fine on
me isuppose he said sueeringly to
nick

  the detective nodded his head

  have you any objection to telling me
what the case against me is

  none in the world

  and then nick told him everything
dellmans face was very grave at the
conclusion i ought to have kept in the
background he muttered

  as you did in the abduction eases
eh-

  yes batson and sam worked those
snaps for me 

  they were about leaving the saloon
when dellman complained of faintness
and asked to be allowed to sit down for
a few moments

  nick saw no reason why the request
might not safely be complied with

  but the moment dellman sat down lie
raised his hands toward his face

  the hand which had been closed since
his departure from the card-room now
opened quickly and a small pellet was as
quickly transferred to his mouth

  too late be cried out in savage
triumph for ill be a dead man in twen-
ty seconds

  nick hastily called for mustard and
salt but before the barkeeper could fur-
nish the articles albert dellman had
ceased to breathe

  the papers next morning had the big-
gest sensation of the year

  the names of nick carter and his now
famous assistant were in everybodys
mouth

  a public ovation would have been

longer in the city of oaks

  bnt business had called them away be-
fore the gaming-house tragedy was a day
old

  they carried with them the heartfelt
gratitude of the astorel family and some-
thing very substantial in the way of a re-
ward which received an addition when
marcus astorel returned from honolulu

  boston sam by reason of his confess-
ion got off with a light sentence for his
share in the series of abductions

  flat-nosed batson was taken to den
ver and tried on the old charge of buig
larv and being found guilty was sen-
tenced to imprisonment for twenty years
